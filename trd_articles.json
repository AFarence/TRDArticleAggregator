        "content": "The Mamdani administration wants to pump the brakes on Pinnacle Group\u2019s bankruptcy auction, not only because it wants time to review the new proposed owners of the firm\u2019s buildings but officials are also worried that stabilized rents at the buildings are too low for the properties to survive.\nIn a request filed with the court late Monday, the city asked federal Bankruptcy Court Judge David Jones to delay the auction of Pinnacle\u2019s portfolio by 30 days. The auction, for more than 5,000 rent-stabilized apartments, is slated for Thursday.\nThe filing follows Mamdani\u2019s\nannouncement\nthat he would intervene in the case and a similar request by the Adams administration to delay the auction. Pinnacle tenants had urged the Adams administration to intervene in the case, wanting more time to weigh in on future ownership.\nBut the new request goes further than its predecessor: not only does the administration want more time to consider who buys the properties, it also warns that the future health of the buildings is imperiled by the fact that most of the units are rent-regulated.\n\u201cHPD\u2019s preliminary internal analysis, based on information and belief, is that the proposed sale would not lead to a supportable business as long as the properties continued to have exclusively rent stabilized or rent controlled units because the current rents are very low-averaging,\u201d the filing states, pointing to increased distress and citing letters from tenants detailing health and safety problems at the buildings.\nSuch an acknowledgement comes as the administration is pushing to freeze rents for stabilized tenants for the next four years.\nA landlord group quickly seized on the filing\u2019s language, saying it was a stunning admission by the city that stabilized rents cannot support building operations.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an astounding contradiction from the Mamdani administration, less than a week into their admin,\u201d said Kenny Burgos, CEO New York Apartment Association. He said the financial realities of the Pinnacle portfolio are shared by other rent-stabilized buildings where the 2019 rent laws closed off most options for raising rents.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if this is some sort of anomaly,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the norm.\u201d\nNYAA was part of a federal lawsuit\nchallenging\nthe state\u2019s rent stabilization system, which was dismissed and ultimately not picked up by the U.S. Supreme Court. The group has also argued against the mayor\u2019s plans to freeze rents for stabilized tenants.\nA City Hall source pointed to the reference to the \u201cproposed sale\u201d as a critical part of HPD\u2019s analysis, noting that the danger of the sale price being too high plays a significant role in the properties\u2019 future viability. The filing posits that if the buildings fall into disrepair, tenants may be pushed out and replaced by higher-paying residents unaware that their units are regulated.\nCea Weaver, Mamdani\u2019s newly-appointed head of the Office to Protect Tenants, previously told the New York Times that it is unfair to blame rent stabilization for the state of Pinnacle\u2019s buildings. She said the landlord\u2019s record of \u201cegregiously treating renters\u201d predates the 2019 law.\nThese latest filings object to the sale of Pinnacle\u2019s properties to Summit Properties USA, which made a\n$451 million stalking horse offer\nto acquire the buildings. Pinnacle, owned by billionaire Joel Wiener, amassed hundreds of stabilized units in the city over the years, many of which have fallen behind on maintenance and racked up housing code violations. In an effort to stave off foreclosure, 82 of the firm\u2019s entities\nfiled for bankruptcy\nlast May, leading to this week\u2019s scheduled auction. The city argues that it wants time to ensure that the new owner of the firm\u2019s stabilized apartments can address $12.7 million in unpaid bills and violations.\nThe administration notes its \u201csubstantial concern\u201d that Summit \u201cmay not have sufficient resources or willingness to rehabilitate the properties, or be able to maintain a profitable business based on the income stream from the rent stabilized or rent controlled apartments in the properties.\u201d\nThe city states that the next owner of the buildings must be able to show that the transfer of the buildings won\u2019t result in further distress and devolve into \u201cfinancial and social chaos potentially worse than the current situation of the Debtors themselves.\u201d\n\u201cIf Summit cannot \u2013 or does not \u2013 remediate the violations the costs of doing so might well fall upon the city, which might have no means to recover such costs,\u201d the filing states.\nThe filing states that the properties shouldn\u2019t be transferred to Summit because the company has \u201cfailed to demonstrate that the Properties can support the proposed sale price and maintenance needs and costs given the regulated rents.\u201d The administration wants more time to review Summit\u2019s plan and to \u201cexplore alternatives.\u201d\nThe filing was submitted by Corporation Counsel Muriel Goode-Trufant, a holdover from the Adams administration. Mamdani\u2019s nomination for the role, Steven Banks, awaits approval by the City Council.\nMamdani announced his plans to intervene in the case shortly after\ntaking office\n, as part of several early actions related to housing. He also unveiled plans to hold a series of\nhearings\naimed at uncovering landlord neglect and finding policy solutions to tenant complaints.\n",

        "content": "Sovereign Partners is ruling its domain at 100 Fifth Avenue thanks to a refinancing package.\nRialto Capital provided a $150 million loan to refinance the Midtown South office building, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. A Newmark team including Jordan Roeschlaub and Chris Kramer negotiated the deal.\nSovereign \u2014 led by brothers Cyrus and Darius Sakhai \u2014 acquired the 20-story office building in 2023\nfor $126.5 million\n. That was barely half the $230 million price Clarion Partners paid to acquire the property a decade earlier.\nDuring its short stewardship of the building, Sovereign has brought the 277,000-square-foot property up to full occupancy, inking 170,000 square feet of new leases. Adobe is the building\u2019s anchor tenant.\nBeyond the refi, it\u2019s been a busy couple of months for the Sakhais.\nLast month, Sovereign Partners sealed the deal\non a $273 million acquisition\nof 2 Grand Central Tower from Rockwood Capital. The deal for the 667,000-square-foot property broke down to $409 per square foot. The last time Rockwood tried to sell (back in February 2020), the private equity investor had expected to sell the tower for\nclose to $580 million\n.\nRockwood purchased the office building in 2011 from Boston Properties, now BXP, for $401 million. Boston Properties bought it for almost $428 million in 2008 from Harry Macklowe, who developed it.\nRialto, through its affiliate Rialto Capital Management, is the country\u2019s\nlargest buyer of CMBS B-piece notes\n. Those notes give the investor the ability to select the special servicer on the loan, including selecting its own affiliate.\nThe company\u2019s servicing arm has garnered a reputation for aggressive techniques. New York landlords who borrowed from the since-collapsed Signature Bank have accused Rialto of \u201cunlawfully manufacturing\u201d defaults,\nThe Real Deal previously reported\n.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The price for John Novak\u2019s year-end deal to buy the troubled southern portion of Lincoln Yards from JP Morgan Asset Management and Sterling Bay amounted to $34 million.\nNovak Construction acquired the 18.4 acres of vacant riverfront land where Chicago-based Sterling Bay had proposed a huge multibillion-dollar mixed-use campus. CoStar first\nreported\nthe sale price. The property sits just west of the empty life sciences building Sterling built at 1229 West Concord Place, a 284,000-square-foot\nlab and office property\nthat remains the only completed building at the proposed megadevelopment.\nThe sale follows the announcement that\ntwo other parcels\nadjacent to the Lincoln Yards site sold last month to an affiliate of Calgary, Alberta-based Jack Carter Automotive Group. It paid $15.5 million for the parcels at 1642 North Besly Court and 1400 West North Avenue.\nNovak\u2019s purchase was the second try at a deal for the southern portion of the site. JP Morgan and Sterling Bay first attempted to sell the site earlier last year to developers JDL and Kayne Anderson at a price Chicago real estate sources pegged at about $60 million. That deal eventually fell apart after JP Morgan balked on completing the transaction.\nKayne and JDL did however form a development team last year to buy the northern\n30-plus acres\nof Lincoln Yards \u2014 which sits on the other side of the Chicago River from Novak\u2019s purchase \u2014 from Bank OZK. Bank OZK had stripped that portion of riverfront property from Sterling Bay and Dallas-based Lone Star Funds, its other partner on the megadevelopment, through a deed in lieu of foreclosure. JDL and Kayne have since sought Chicago City Council approval to build more than 3,700 residential units on that stretch.\nNovak told\nThe Real Deal\nlast month that the\nLincoln Yards deal\nwould amount to the most land his firm has ever purchased for development. The 45-year-old company began as a general contractor, but in recent years has forayed into development projects that include big box retailers such as Target and Whole Foods.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Meyer Chetrit appeared in court briefly Tuesday morning, where he and his brother Joseph are facing criminal tenant harassment charges that could see the landlords serve prison time.\nMeyer spent about 15 minutes in front of the judge at Manhattan\u2019s Supreme Court building, dressed in a tan cardigan, brown pants and a blue scarf hanging around the back of his neck. Joseph\u2019s appearance had been waived due to an infirmity.\nThe brothers had already pleaded not guilty several months ago to two counts of tenant harassment. At Tuesday\u2019s hearing, two of the LLCs involved in the case entered not-guilty pleas, and the defendants signed a consent protective order regarding the tenants.\nMeyer gave a few quiet, one-word replies when questioned by the judge, and a few moments later the largely uneventful hearing was adjourned. The brothers are due back in court on April 29.\nHe\nwas indicted\nin September by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s office with two counts of harassment of a rent-regulated tenant in the first degree. Those charges are classified as a class E felony and carry a maximum sentence of four years in prison.\nAccording to the allegations, Meyer had \u201cwaged a campaign of harassment\u201d against two elderly, rent-regulated tenants in Chelsea over a period of five years, hoping they would move out so the building could be sold.\nThe tenants lived at 117-119 West 26th Street in Chelsea since the 1980s. Chetrit purchased the building in 2005 but allegedly failed to complete its conversion from commercial lofts to residential housing. The apartments are classified as \u201cinterim multiple dwellings\u201d and overseen by the city\u2019s Loft Board.\nIn addition to extended periods without heat and a ceiling collapse, the building has been without an elevator since September 2023, the DA\u2019s office said. That year, part of the building\u2019s unoccupied commercial section collapsed, prompting a partial vacate order.\n\u201cFrom winters without heat and unrepaired roofs causing leaks and ceiling collapses, these New Yorkers were forced to live in uninhabitable conditions,\u201d Bragg said in a statement.\nJoseph\nwas indicted\nlater in October and charged as a co-defendant.\nThe Chetrits\u2019 arrest has become a\nlightning rod\nfor tenant advocates.\nState Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal, who represents the Upper West Side where the brothers own\nthe Park West Village\non Columbus Avenue between West 97th and 100th streets, said he launched a confidential survey to determine the scope of the problem.\nElected officials on the Upper West Side have raised alarms about\nChetrit\u2019s management of the Park West Village\n, where tenants there have accused Chetrit of pocketing city rent subsidies without crediting them to renters\u2019 accounts, and then pursuing eviction.\n\u201cMeyer Chetrit\u2019s indictment echoes the pattern of harassment and mismanagement that tenants in my district have reported for years under his management,\u201d Hoylman-Sigal said in a statement to\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cNo landlord should take taxpayer funds, bill tenants twice, and leave people in unsafe homes.\u201d\n",

Five Holdings is the parent company of nightlife brand Pacha \u2014 known for its famed Ibiza nightclub \u2014 and will set up shop in Brooklyn.\nThe acquisition by the Dubai-based holding company was first reported by\nTraded\n.\nPacha\u2019s deal is the latest twist in the fate of a venue as known for its storied live music scene as its propensity to harbor drug use, aggressive security and even death; a Gothamist\ninvestigation\nfound three visitors died of drug overdoses between 2018 and mid-2022.\nThe venue closed for renovations last year, setting a May 1 opening date and a summer full of shows. But the venue failed to meet its inspection deadline and the Department of Buildings yanked its temporary occupancy certificate, Brooklyn Paper\nreported\n; an agency spokesperson declared the venue unsafe.\nAvant Gardner\u2019s parent company filed for bankruptcy in early August, reporting\n$153.3 million in funded debt obligations\n, according to Bloomberg. The chief executive officer \u2014 himself a DJ \u2014 blamed financial troubles on the loss of the Mirage and aggressive lenders. The company claimed it was working with DOB on a remediation plan.\nHowever, ownership in October\nfiled for a demolition permit\nfor at least part of the venue. The application was for a full demolition of 32,000 square feet; the overall complex is roughly 80,000 square feet and the estimated cost of razing is $1.5 million.\nShortly after the permit was filed, private equity firm and lender Axar Capital Management reached a deal to buy the venue for $110 million with an eye towards reopening in 2026. As the calendar flipped, however, so did Axar, which agreed instead to have the property sold to Five Holdings for the same price.\nIt\u2019s unclear when Pacha\u2019s slice of European nightlife will hit Brooklyn\u2019s waters. Representatives for the buyer and seller did not respond to the Observer\u2019s requests for comment.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Luxury deals drove Manhattan\u2019s sales market\nfor most of 2025, but by year\u2019s end, the momentum trickled down.\nLast quarter, co-op sales \u2014 generally priced below condos \u2014 outpaced condo deals in the borough for the first time in more than a year, powered by a steady decline in mortgage rates during the back half of the year, according to Miller Samuel\u2019s\nquarterly report\nfor Douglas Elliman.\n\u201cAs mortgage rates drifted lower, we saw an improvement in sales of lower-priced units because those buyers are more reliant on mortgage rates,\u201d said report author Jonathan Miller, who added that mortgage rates had fallen 60 basis points since the summer.\nThe rise in co-op deals fueled an increase in sales across both property types in the three-month period, despite fears that New York City\u2019s mayoral election and its victor, Zohran Mamdani, would chill sales.\n\u201cThe housing market right now is a Goldilocks market,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt\u2019s just right.\u201d\nManhattan nabbed more than 2,600 closed sales in the fourth quarter, up 5 percent from less than 2,500 in the same period in 2024. The median sale price was $1.13 million, up slightly from $1.1 million during the same time frame.\nRoughly 1,500 co-ops traded in the fourth quarter, up 7 percent from fewer than 1,400 in the fourth quarter of 2024. During the same period, the borough logged 1,200 condo sales, up just 3 percent year-over-year from 1,100. The median sale price of co-ops was $825,000, while the median sale price of a condo was $1.7 million.\nIf rates continue to dwindle, which Miller said many economists expect, it\u2019s likely activity at the lower end of the market could continue to bolster sales across the borough through the first quarter of 2026, especially as a\nboom in deals for luxury\nproperties throughout the first three quarters of last year tightened inventory levels at the highest end of the market.\nListings for luxury homes \u2014 defined in the report as the top 10 percent of condo and co-op sales \u2014 fell 15 percent annually, outpacing the overall market, where inventory dropped just 4 percent. While the decrease was less substantial, co-op and condo inventory in Manhattan fell to its lowest level since 2017.\nLast quarter was a departure from the rest of 2025, which saw modest increases in inventory in the first three quarters, though growth in the number of sales was outpacing listings hitting the market for most of those periods.\n\u201cWe have a housing market that is not showing the \u2018Mamdani effect,\u2019\u201d Miller said. \u201cOverall, we\u2019re seeing sales edge higher, prices edge higher and inventory declining, with the biggest drop at the top of the market because that segment has been outperforming the balance of the market.\u201d\nDespite a decline in mortgage rates, cash sales still dominated in the fourth quarter, with three out of four buyers purchasing their condos in all-cash deals. Cash sales hit their highest market share in at least a decade in 2025, with roughly 65 percent of purchases made with all cash.\nRoughly 7.5 percent of sales closed in the fourth quarter were the result of\nbidding wars\n, marking the highest share in three years. Despite the rise, Miller said bidding wars are still in the range considered normal for Manhattan, where the record share was 31 percent in 2015.\nWhile the lower end of the market stole the spotlight last quarter, Miller said the luxury market is still \u201cin a good position to fare better, regardless of rates,\u201d thanks to two \u201cbanner years\u201d for Wall Street.\n",

Thomas Duane filed a lawsuit looking to block the redevelopment of the Fulton and Elliott-Chelsea Houses, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The lawsuit claims NYCHA\u2019s plan is illegal, as it involves leasing the properties to Related Companies, ostensibly in violation of a state law dating back to 2010.\n\u201cIt is absolutely unacceptable that the city of New York would sell its land and low-income housing to a private developer,\u201d Duane said in a statement. He represented the neighborhood for 14 years in the state senate.\nDuane expressed fear about displacement, citing statistics. The lawsuit cited a study from the comptroller\u2019s office that found eviction rates at privatized public housing to be 0.57 percent, compared to a 0.12 percent rate at more conventional NYCHA complexes.\nNYCHA declined to comment on the lawsuit due to pending litigation.\nIt\u2019s the latest challenge to NYCHA\u2019s $2 billion plan to demolish and rebuild the pair of properties.\nIn November, a judge\nrefused\nto order two senior citizens residing in the Fulton and Elliott-Chelsea Houses to immediately vacate. Most of the residents are able to stay in place while work is done to build the forthcoming properties, but some are being asked to temporarily relocate and not all are willing, leading to multiple lawsuits.\nNYCHA and Related\nfiled plans\nfor a 12-story, 217-unit building at 401 West 19th Street over the summer.\nThe development team, which also includes Essence Development, is replacing more than 2,000 public housing units. They will also build retail and commercial space, as well as 3,500 mixed-income apartments, 1,000 of which will be put aside at affordable rates.\nLast month, the Public Authorities Control Board approved the redevelopment of the first apartment tower, a project expected to cost $1.2 million per unit.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Midtown Capital Partners scored an $84 million construction bridge loan for its Flagler Village apartment project.\nMiami-based Midtown Capital is expected to complete the 252-unit Astor Park Flagler Village with a pair of 12-story buildings this summer. The complex, at 333 Northeast Sixth Street in Fort Lauderdale, is on tap as South Florida feels pressure from a supply overhang following years of hefty multifamily completions.\nBridgeInvest, based in Miami, provided the floating-rate loan, which refinanced Midtown Capital\u2019s construction loan and funded remaining completion costs, according to a news release from the financing\u2019s broker.\nMitch Sinberg and Scott Wadler were part of the Berkadia team that represented the borrower.\nMidtown Capital obtained a\n$64.5 million\nconstruction financing for Astor Park in 2022.\nApartments will range from studios spanning nearly 600 square feet to penthouses spanning nearly 1,800 square feet, according to the release. Astor Park will include four live-work ground-floor apartments; 2,400 square feet of retail; and a 318-space garage. All apartments will be at market-rate rents.\nThe 1.4-acre site is across from Peter Feldman Park.\nBerkadia and Midtown Capital didn\u2019t immediately return inquiries about pre-leasing at Astor Park.\nMidtown Capital, led by Alejandro Velez, also plans a\n22-story, 348-unit\nLive Local Act building in Miami\u2019s Little River neighborhood; and it\u2019s developing the 230-unit Astor Sound apartment complex in Lake Worth Beach. It scored a\n$57 million\nbridge loan in September for the nearly finished Astor Sound.\nMultifamily developers seized on the influx of out-of-state residents to South Florida and ensuing apartment leasing frenzy in recent years by starting new projects.\nDespite a record\n18,600\nunit completions in 2024, developers kept building, with the tri-county region recording\n14,515\napartment construction starts in the 12-month period that ended in September, according to CoStar Group. The supply overhang led to slower leaseups, a decrease in rents and more concessions.\nDevelopers building multifamily have countered that leasing will resume by the time they finish their buildings and that they are carefully picking the submarkets for their projects to ensure the areas aren\u2019t over-saturated.\nAlso in Fort Lauderdale, Moderno Development Group and 75Invest received site plan approval in September for the 26-story, 265-unit Art Lofts with 43 workforce housing units south of the New River.\n",

The average asking price for the condos is $6.3 million, or $2,423 per square foot. They spent an average of 23 days on the market.\nThe average asking price for the single-family homes is $6.4 million, or $1,481 per square foot, and they spent an average of 88 days on the market.\nThe most expensive listing to find a buyer last week was the 1.8-acre property at 7621\nSouth Flagler Drive\nand 101 Alhambra Place in West Palm Beach asking $16 million.

NIC is a founding partner of the 91-mile long Trans-Panama Pipeline, which connects oil distribution between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.\nThe Bernsteins, through their TPTS LLC, have acquired a small portfolio of West Palm Beach real estate. In 2021, they bought the 20,000-square-foot warehouse at 2350 Florida Avenue for $4.2 million, records show.\nThe South Flagler and Alhambra assemblage is being marketed as a development opportunity for up to four homes, the listing shows. There are currently three homes on the site. The Bernsteins put it on the market asking $16 million in February. Burton Minkoff with Douglas Elliman had the listing.\nThe next priciest contract last week was for the 5,500-square-foot home at 702 North Ocean Boulevard in Delray Beach asking $10 million. Records show the seller is retired biotech executive Kathy P. Ordo\u00f1ez, who bought the 0.6-acre property for $2.2 million in 2012. She built the five-bedroom, five-bathroom house in 2019. It includes a half-bathroom, sauna, pool and a deeded beach path, the listing shows.\nShe listed it for $10 million on Dec. 23, and it went into contract eight days later.\nNick Malinosky\nand Michael O\u2019Connor with Elliman have the listing.",

In 2023, Horses made headlines for other reasons as the husband and wife who owned and operated the restaurant, Will Aghajanian and Liz Johnson, went through a contentious public\ndivorce\n.

Other residents on the street include\nNvidia\nCEO Jensen Huang and oil heir Gordon Getty.\nThe five-bedroom manse was originally designed by architect William Wurster in 1958 and redesigned by architect Olle Lundberg in the early 1990s after Ellison acquired the property.\nTrophy homes have become Ellison\u2019s specialty, with the executive snapping up some of the country\u2019s priciest properties and building\na sizable real estate portfolio\nfrom coast to coast and beyond. In 2022, Ellison bought\nan estate in Manalapan, Florida\n, previously owned by Netscape co-founder Jim Clark for approximately $173 million. He also owns 98 percent of the Hawaiian island of Lanai and\nbought a lion safari\nin Florida late last year for $30 million.\nThe San Francisco home sale comes as Ellison\u2019s son David, president and CEO of Paramount Skydance, is in a hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. Larry Ellison is financing the effort with a personal guarantee of $40.4 billion in equity financing. Warner Bros. Discovery announced a deal last month to sell most of its operations\nto Netflix for $72 million\n, prompting Paramount to launch a rival bid totaling $108.4 billion.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Callahan Capital Partners\nis the new owner of the 101 Mission Street building in San Francisco\u2019s Financial District.\nThe Chicago-based real estate private equity firm teamed up with local real estate firm Probis Strategic Solutions to purchase the 22-story office tower for about $82 million, the San Francisco Standard\nreported\n. New York-based Vanbarton Group bought 101 Mission in 2018 for $163 million before defaulting on a $93 million mortgage. Vanbarton spent more than $30 million renovating common areas and tenant spaces.\nThe deal for the 1985-built building is a deed in lieu of foreclosure, meaning the property was sold by lenders who foreclosed on the debt tied to the building. Last July, activist investor Elliott Investment Management\nacquired the $93 million debt\nfor an undisclosed amount before marketing the property for sale.\nThe building spans 213,000 square feet and is more than 50 percent occupied. Tenants include real estate firm\nRubicon Point Partners\nand beverage producer Constellation Brands.\nCallahan Capital\u2019s purchase marks the company\u2019s first office buy in San Francisco. The firm plans to renovate the building and \u201cmove forward quickly with a thoughtful repositioning strategy,\u201d CEO Tim Callahan said in a statement.\nProbis got involved in the purchase because it saw the San Francisco office market showing \u201cmeaningful signs of recovery\u201d as\nartificial intelligence firms moved into town\nand snapped up more office space, David Dowdney, managing partner of Probis, said. The company \u201cbelieve[s] high-quality, well-located office buildings in San Francisco are entering a new phase of opportunity, and 101 Mission is exceptionally well-positioned to benefit from that recovery.\u201d\nLast spring, Brookfield Properties\nwas in talks\nto buy the debt linked to 101 Mission Street, as an affiliate of the New York-based company originated a mezzanine loan for Vanbarton\u2019s 2018 purchase of the building. But Brookfield and loan seller ING Group couldn\u2019t come to an agreement with lender partners about how to move forward, and the deal ultimately\nfell through\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A pair of aging buildings at one of downtown Austin\u2019s busiest corners could soon come down, clearing the way for new development \u2014 if the city\u2019s Historic Landmark Commission signs off.\nOn Wednesday, the commission is set to consider a demolition permit for 422 Congress Avenue and 101 West Fifth Street, according to the meeting agenda. Los Angeles-based Karlin Real Estate, which owns the properties, has already filed the application, and city staff are recommending approval,\naccording\nto the Austin Business Journal.\nThe proposed teardown would directly affect\nShiner\u2019s Saloon\n, the longtime bar that has occupied the ground floor space since 2008. Co-owner and manager David Jalufka said the bar\u2019s lease runs through the end of April, though renewals in recent years have been short-term. He said he would prefer to keep Shiner\u2019s in place, but acknowledged its future is uncertain.\nThe two buildings date back more than a century combined. The structure at 101 West Fifth Street was built in 1914, while the building at\n422 Congress Avenue\nfollowed in 1940. Despite their age, neither property contributes to the Congress Avenue National Register District, according to commission documents, weakening any preservation argument. The properties once belonged to Nate Paul\u2019s\nWorld Class Holdings\n.\nCity staff\u2019s recommendation includes conditions: salvaging any remaining original materials discovered during demolition and ensuring the work does not damage the structure at 416 Congress Avenue, an 1890s-era historic building that shares a wall with the sites slated for removal.\nKarlin declined to comment on its plans. A site plan application has been filed with the city, but its status is listed as \u201cnot started,\u201d offering no clues about what might rise in place of the existing buildings.\nThe property spans just 0.17 acres, and developers have the potential to maximize the vertical space. The properties sit at the southwest corner of Congress Avenue and West Fifth Street, a prime downtown location where density can soar.\nUnder Austin\u2019s land development code, a project participating in the Downtown Density Bonus Program could reach a floor-to-area ratio of 25-to-1, with no hard height limit, subject to City Council approval.\nThat potential is partially complicated by a Capitol View Corridor slicing through a portion of 422 Congress Avenue, imposing height restrictions meant to protect sightlines to the Texas State Capitol. Still, most of the site lies outside the corridor, opening the door to a staggered tower design that steps down near Congress and climbs higher toward the rear.\nDowntown Austin is currently capped at 350 feet after the City Council imposed a temporary\nheight limit\nin October. But for developers willing to pay into the bonus program, the sky remains the real limit.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "One of Douglas Elliman\u2019s biggest brokers in Brooklyn is returning to Compass.\nLindsay Barton Barrett, known for brokering some of the borough\u2019s priciest deals, is exiting Elliman after seven years to join Compass, where she was previously an agent. Joining her at Compass are her four team members, including Kaitlin McGlynn, Taylor Schultz and Christopher Mohr.\n\u201cIt really feels like a homecoming,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different world from when I left.\u201d\nUnder the Compass banner, Barrett said she plans to add more agents to her team, which also represents listings in Downtown Manhattan.\n\u201cWhile I\u2019ve always had a super lean team, I think right now we might be a little too lean for the amount of business we\u2019re doing,\u201d Barrett said.\nBarrett began her first stint at Compass in 2015, when she left Corcoran to join the fledgling firm among an early class of New York City-based recruits. At the time of her move, the brokerage, then known as Urban Compass, had also just brought over 25 other agents from Corcoran to build out its headcount, which was then in the hundreds. Barrett said by the time she departed roughly four years later, that number had grown to more than 10,000.\nBarrett\njumped to Elliman\nin 2018, a move she credited, in part, to wanting to be with a more traditional, legacy brokerage. Once onboard the new firm, she began to enhance her focus on new development.\nWhile at Elliman, she led sales at the Brooklyn Home Company\u2019s 350 Butler Street in Park Slope, which sold out in August, and launched sales at the developer\u2019s 524 Halsey Street in Bedford-Stuyvesant, which is roughly 85 percent sold.\nDuring her tenure at Elliman, Barrett closed some of the borough\u2019s most expensive townhouse trades, including representing billionaire Vincent Viola and his wife, Theresa, in the\n$25.5 million\nsale of their home at 8 Montague Terrace in Brooklyn Heights. The deal closed in 2021, marking the highest price ever achieved for a home in the borough.\nBarrett also represented the Brooklyn Home Company in their 2024 sale of 1 Sidney Place, which Glossier founder Emily Weiss and her partner, fintech executive William Gaybrick, bought for\n$22.1 million\n. The deal claimed the No. 2 spot among Brooklyn\u2019s top deals.\nBarrett currently holds the priciest listing in Cobble Hill, a seven-bedroom townhouse at 205 Clinton Street asking $22 million. She\u2019s also bringing with her to Compass listings at 50 Bridge Park Drive, also known as Quay Tower, and 113 North 9th Street in Williamsburg.\n\u201cWe wish Lindsay the best as we continue to field calls from a high volume of agents who want to work for the only truly agent-focused luxury and independent brokerage in the nation,\u201d a spokesperson for Elliman said in a statement.\nBarrett\u2019s team placed 21st among\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nlatest ranking\nof the top resale brokers in New York City with $78 million in sell-side sales volume. Her cohort also ranked 33rd among the leading new development agents with $58 million in closed deals.\nIn 2023, Barrett\nteamed up\nwith Maggie Marshall. Later that year, the Barton Barrett Marshall Team partnered with the Heyman Team at Sotheby\u2019s International to head sales at Fortis Property Group\u2019s Olympia Dumbo, replacing the Eklund-Gomes Team.\nMarshall and Barrett later parted ways. Marshall left Elliman to join Compass last August, as several of the brokerage\u2019s top agents, including Holly Parker and Noble Black, began departing for other firms.\nThough Elliman has lost a number of its leading brokers, the firm also nabbed its\nfirst major recruit\nlast month, when Heather Domi and her five-person team joined the fold. Domi, who was previously with Compass, is a co-founder and founding chair of the New York Residential Agent Continuum.\n",

Barnett also founded Beauty.com, one of the first internet cosmetics retailers. He is a son of Victor Barnett, former chairman of Burberry, and a member of the Wolfson family.

The bayfront neighborhood is home to billionaires who include hedge funder Ken Griffin. Griffin paid nearly\n$107 million\nfor the waterfront 4-acre estate that belonged to Adrienne Arsht at 3031 and 3115 Brickell Avenue, also in Coconut Grove, in 2022.\nLast month, Mas, board chairman of the construction and engineering giant MasTec and managing owner of Inter Miami CF, sold the 7.3-acre residential lot next to the Kampong botanical garden in the Grove to a hidden buyer for\nmore than $100 million\n.\nAlso in December,\nBanyan Ridge\n, a 4.5-acre waterfront compound at 3585 Anchorage Way in Coconut Grove, traded for $101.5 million, according to the MLS.

The sale equates to $353,000 per unit.\nBrown was a longtime owner of the property going as far back as the 1990s, property records show. Though details of the original sale price are unclear, Brown took out a $7.3 million mortgage from Citibank on the property in 2007 and later refinanced it for $9.3 million in 2022, records show.\nThe courtyard-style building, built in 1915,\u00a0 includes seven studios, seven one-bedroom units, 31 two-bedroom and three three-bedroom units and one four-bedroom unit.\nThe sale price highlights\nthe strength of Chicago\u2019s multifamily market in 2025\n, particularly among\nmid-market properties\n.\nWhile Chicago deals with challenging market conditions ranging from an\nunpredictable property tax system\n,\na progressive city council\nand high interest rates,\nlocal buyers and sellers have an edge\nin navigating those obstacles.\nAt the same time, developers from Chicago and elsewhere have struggled to secure financing from hesitant lenders, resulting in\na historically low pipeline\nof new multifamily construction. Those same lenders are also often needed to back mortgages for some for the city\u2019s high-rises.\nAs a result, mid-market properties have found themselves in an advantageous position. Low supply has\ndriven rents up\n, and buyers have had easier access to financing for mid-range properties than for high-rises, which have\nmore often sold for less\nthan their prior price.\nInterra, which specializes in mid-market sales, recorded $111 million in multifamily transactions in 2025 on the North Side alone, according to a press release from the brokerage.\nJust down the street at 501 West Deming Place, Interra\u2019s\nO\u2019Malley brokered the sale of a 56-unit building for $19.4 million in November\n. The property was also owned by the estate of Brown, the former owner of the apartments at 506 West Deming Place. The buyers were another Chicago-based venture led by Hayes Properties.",

        "content": "The Chicago Housing Authority\u2019s already protracted search for a permanent CEO just got longer.\nJillian Baldwin, one of six finalists \u2014 and the board\u2019s apparent top choice \u2014 withdrew from consideration, opting instead to remain in her current role leading the housing authority in Bridgeport, Connecticut, according to the Connecticut Post. The Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\nthat Baldwin decided to stay after negotiating with city leaders there, and she declined to comment when reached by the outlet.\nThe exit sends CHA back to the drawing board nearly after former CEO Tracey Scott\nresigned\non Nov. 1, 2024. At the time, the authority said it expected to name a successor by summer 2025. The job remains unfilled, with no clear timeline for resolution.\nBaldwin\u2019s departure is notable not just for the delay it causes, but for what it says about the job itself. Baldwin earns about $300,000 in Bridgeport, roughly in line with what she would have made in Chicago. Scott\u2019s salary was around $311,000 when she left. Compensation, at least on paper, wasn\u2019t the sticking point.\nCHA board member and resident Francine Washington told the outlet that Baldwin was the board\u2019s No. 1 candidate, and that residents cannot wait any longer.\nInstead, the authority remains mired in\ngovernance turmoil\nand a\npublic standoff\nwith the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Much of that conflict centers on retired Alderman Walter Burnett, Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s preferred candidate for the job.\nBurnett, one of the\noriginal finalists\n, cannot currently be considered because CHA lacks HUD-approved conflict of interest waivers. Those waivers are tied to Burnett\u2019s three decades on City Council and his longstanding role as a landlord to CHA voucher holders. Burnett and his wife have collected more than $260,000 since 2007 from CHA-backed rents.\nThe waiver process stalled during last year\u2019s government shutdown and is now awaiting a final determination from HUD\u2019s Washington headquarters, according to a HUD official. CHA resident leaders have vocally opposed Burnett\u2019s candidacy, arguing he is out of touch with public housing tenants \u2014 a charge Burnett disputes.\nBurnett has taken his case public, recently urging supporters on Facebook to send prewritten letters to HUD Secretary Scott Turner backing his candidacy. His wife, Darlena Williams-Burnett, also weighed in online. She previously resigned from CHA after being found to have violated the agency\u2019s ethics policy, the Chicago Tribune reported.\nOther candidates have thinned out, according to the Sun-Times. Keith Pettigrew of the District of Columbia Housing Authority has withdrawn. Eugene Jones Jr., CHA\u2019s CEO until 2019, remains in the mix, as does Gregg Fortner, formerly of the Anniston Housing Authority in Alabama.\nWhoever eventually takes the job will inherit oversight of 65,000 households, more than 21,000 units and a $1.4 billion budget \u2014 and an agency running out of patience. The CHA board meets next on Jan. 20.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The deal and project are subject to final zoning approvals, but the club aims to break ground this spring and relocate next year from its longtime training base at SeatGeek Stadium in Bridgeview.\nIf completed, the\nBannockburn\nproject would be the largest capital investment in the Stars\u2019 history since the franchise was founded in 2007, a demonstration of how quickly the economics of women\u2019s professional sports \u2014 and the real estate that supports them \u2014 are changing.\nThe National Women\u2019s Soccer League has benefited from a new media rights deal, growing sponsorship revenue and a landmark milestone in 2024, when Kansas City opened the first privately financed stadium built specifically for a women\u2019s pro team. Against that backdrop, Chicago Cubs co-owner\nLaura Ricketts\nbought the Stars in 2023 for $35.5 million with an all-female ownership group and has pushed to upgrade the club\u2019s infrastructure.\nThe\nBannockburn\nplan calls for reusing a vacant 56,732-square-foot former Walgreens customer support center along the Tri-State Tollway. Designed with the Ricketts family\u2019s Marquee Development and architecture firm Populous, the complex would feature two full-size soccer fields, a goalkeeper-specific pitch and roughly 45,000 square feet of training and\noffice space\n, according to the publication. One field would be enclosed by an air-supported dome, allowing year-round use and doubling as a high-visibility billboard for the club along I-94.\nStars President Karen Leetzow told the outlet that the team scouted sites across the region to escape what she described as \u201csubstandard\u201d conditions in Bridgeview. While the Stars no longer share SeatGeek Stadium with the Chicago Fire, they still face limited access and field wear from other tenants, she said.\nThe project\u2019s total cost is expected to land between $30 million and $40 million, including the purchase price. The property has been marketed for just under $7 million, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield. It\u2019s owned by a venture tied to Miami-based L2B Invest, which bought it in 2015 for $11 million, records show.\nThe Stars plan to fund the project privately, though Leetzow said the club will continue to pursue public funding opportunities down the road \u2014 particularly if Illinois backs stadium projects for men\u2019s teams like the Bears or White Sox.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The purchase price and buyer\u2019s identity were not disclosed.\nWhile the land is coming under new ownership, Saks Global will still own the 200,000-square foot building and has inked a long-term lease deal for the Neiman Marcus store with the property\u2019s unnamed new owner. \u201cThis opportunistic real estate transaction does not impact our day-to-day operations,\u201d a spokesperson told the Chronicle.\nThe lease agreement for the Neiman Marcus store, completed last month, is for 99 years. Saks Global separated the land from the building lease last month \u2014 a move that could provide additional security to the buyer should Saks Global file for bankruptcy, as is expected according to reports this week.

        "content": "Moshe Silber is out of prison\n, but he is staring down a major financial hole.\nThe investor and his business partner, Fred Schulman, were ordered to pay $21.7 million in restitution to their lender, JLL. The pair pleaded guilty over a year ago to a\nmortgage fraud scheme\nin which they obtained an inflated loan for a 976-unit rental property in Cincinnati.\nA lawyer for Silber and Schulman argued the duo did not owe any restitution to JLL, claiming that employees of the lender were well aware of the fraud.\nThe defendants pleaded guilty in 2024 to a conspiracy to commit wire fraud charge and were sentenced earlier this year.\nBut how much they owed was undetermined, and the sides had vastly different numbers in mind. In December 2025, prosecutors argued the number should be $30 million. Silber and Schulman\u2019s side said JLL should be awarded no restitution.\n\u201cHigh ranking executives of JLL were complicit in, and facilitated, the Cincinnati fraudulent loan transactions,\u201d Silber and Schulman\u2019s attorneys wrote in a filing. \u201cAs a result, JLL is precluded from asserting that it was a \u201cvictim\u201d of the defendants\u2019 conduct.\u201d\nU.S. District Court Judge Robert Kirsch of New Jersey did not buy this argument. \u201c[T]o make such a finding that would resolve defendants of their substantial restitution obligations,\u201d he wrote in a 25-page ruling in late December.\nSilber and Schulman\u2019s case was among the first in a\nbroader crackdown on commercial mortgage fraud\nby the Department of Justice and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Silber, Schulman and their co-conspirator, Boruch Drillman, embarked on a scheme in 2019 to buy an apartment complex for $70 million before using a stolen identity to essentially \u201cflip\u201d the property to themselves for $96 million.\nThe higher purchase price served as a key metric to secure a $74 million loan from JLL, which then sold the loan to Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored agency that buys loans from private lenders.\nThe true victim\nThe two sides bickered over where to pin blame.\nJLL was not a victim of the fraud, lawyer Jerome Ballarotto argued on behalf of Silber and Schulman.\nJLL repurchased the loan from Fannie Mae in 2024 for $81 million, the defense argued, knowing it would result in a significant loss, for two reasons: JLL had to repair its relationship with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the firm became aware that two executives handling the loan were complicit in the fraud.\nBut Silber and Schulman failed to provide any documentation backing these claims, Kirsch said, and there was no indication that the two JLL executives were ever investigated by law enforcement over the Cincinnati transaction.\nIn his ruling, Kirsch deemed the true victim of the fraud to be Fannie Mae. He said JLL was not a victim since it repurchased the loan from Fannie Mae knowing the loan was in distress and the property was in disrepair.\nKirsch said JLL could still be awarded restitution because it compensated the true victim, Fannie Mae, for its loss by purchasing the loan.\nThe restitution came down to $21.7 million after fees, escrow money paid and the sale of the property for $60 million.\nThe elder investor\nSchulman had argued that if the judge did award restitution, he should pay much less.\nKirsch had gone easier on Schulman at the sentencing hearing in March 2025, allowing him to self-surrender and sentencing him to just one year in prison. (Drillman was given no prison time. Silber was sentenced to 30 months in prison, but was\nmoved to a halfway house\nin December just nine months into his sentence.)\nThis time, Kirsch was not sympathetic to Schulman, who is in his 70s.\nKirsch noted that Schulman was a lawyer, banker and venture capitalist who built a successful career and had claimed to be a mentor and father figure to Silber, who was nearly four decades younger.\n\u201cDespite \u2018clearly being the adult\u2019 in that relationship and well versed in the fields of law and finance, Schulman did not use his fatherly role and wealth of experience to advise Silber,\u201d Kirsch said.\nInstead, he undertook an \u201cactive and integral\u201d role in the fraud, Kirsch added.\nDuring his sentencing hearing, Kirsch allowed Schulman to surrender to prison based on certain upcoming family responsibilities, including taking care of his ailing wife.\nBut the federal judge noted in his ruling that Schulman took advantage of the court\u2019s generous spirit\u2026 \u201cover and over and over again\u201d by frequently traveling to the Hamptons instead of finding care for his ailing wife.\nSchulman and Silber\u2019s lawyer did not return a request for comment. JLL also did not return a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "A spike in insurance premiums is a big reason operating costs have shot up. But why did that happen?\nA prime suspect is bogus litigation, which some multifamily owners say insurers too often settle rather than fight.\nThey point to trip-and-fall lawsuits in which insurers caved despite video evidence proving that the accidents were fake, or that the person who fell in the stairwell was typing furiously on his cellphone rather than watching his step.\nWill the government come to the rescue? Might Zohran Mamdani prod the City Council or state to offer a low-cost insurance product, allowing owners to pour the savings back into their buildings?\nThe government does provide flood insurance and (after 9/11) terrorism insurance. But nobody can fake a natural disaster or a terrorist attack.\nFor standard liability policies, the government would not be any better at handling fraudulent claims, and probably worse. It seems to me that it would have even less incentive than private insurers to litigate rather than settle.\nHistory offers a clue. When Mike Bloomberg became mayor, he was faced with a large budget deficit and responded by raising property taxes 18 percent \u2014 which made him immediately unpopular. But then he set about cutting spending.\nOne way he did that was by\nshifting responsibility\nfor sidewalk maintenance to property owners in 2003. It wasn\u2019t just to save money on repairs. Rather, the city was getting hammered by trip-and-fall lawsuits. Now, property owners do.\nThe city did exempt one-, two- and three-family, owner-occupied homes from\nliability\nbecause those owners have less financial capacity (and also tend to be prime voters).\nThe 2003 shift wasn\u2019t exactly an innovative solution to rising lawsuit expenses. And it suggests that the government is not likely to take any responsibility back, even by offering a reinsurance product as a backstop for carriers.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill multifamily owners view Mayor Zohran Mamdani\u2019s\n\u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings\nas antisemitic? New York City landlords are disproportionately Jewish, and so far only landlords have been targeted by Mamdani for public hearings. One will be held in each borough.\nIt is true that housing is New Yorkers\u2019 greatest expense and that two-thirds of city residents are renters. So it\u2019s a logical place to begin the push for affordability on which Mamdani campaigned.\nHowever, many Jews in the industry were already on edge about Mamdani, and reacted negatively when he rescinded two executive orders by his predecessor, Eric Adams. One equated some criticism of Israel with hatred of Jews and the other banned city agencies from boycotting Israel, the New York Times\nreported\n.\nSend your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Of the 47,000 planned housing units that don\u2019t have building permits, 31 percent are in filings from more than five years ago, \u201cwhich means they are likely stalled or may never begin construction,\u201d according to a Real Estate Board of New York\nreport\n.\nThe least productive of the 51 City Council districts is represented by Julie Menin, the new speaker. Her East Side district has\nnegative\nnine units in pre-development: More are slated to be lost through demolition, consolidation or use changes than created. However, in terms of units under construction, it ranks in the middle of the pack with 961.\nElsewhere\u2026\nOne of the best economics podcasts has shut down, but not before leaving real estate geeks with a final nugget of wisdom.\nThe 118th episode of The Economics of Everyday Things looked at\nurban trees\n, which significantly benefit not only the environment and human health but also real estate.\nA 2007 study in East Portland found that a single tree in front of a home raised that home\u2019s sales price by more than $7,000 and the value of homes within a 100-foot radius by a total of $13,000.\nAs a result, Portland\u2019s street trees were increasing property tax revenues by $15.3 million a year, about 5 times more than homeowners spent to maintain them.\nThe same researcher found that Sacramento shade trees reduced a home\u2019s electric bill by an average of $25 during summer months.\nAnother survey found trees benefit retail real estate, as shoppers judge merchants on tree-lined streets to be more knowledgeable and pleasant and said they would spend 9 percent to 15 percent more in retail areas with a nice canopy.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$10 million\nfor a 3,984-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at 85 Worth Street in Tribeca. The Eklund Gomes Team with Douglas Elliman had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$55 million\nfor the Woodcrest Rehab &amp; Residential Health Care Center property at 119-09 26th Avenue in College Point. An entity tied to Jacob Sod purchased it from Jack Deutsch.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$14 million\nfor a 4,315-square-foot condominium unit at 459 West Broadway in Soho. Kristina Paces with Serhant has\nthe listing\n.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "A long-stalled redevelopment of Blue Island\u2019s shuttered MetroSouth Medical Center has collapsed, revealing larger financial issues for the firm planning the project.\nDelray Beach, Florida-based\nLockwood Development Partners\nbought the 12.5-acre campus with a vacant 550,000-square-foot main hospital building for more than $20 million in 2020, with plans to transform the property into senior and veteran housing, according to public records.\nThe company\u2019s proposal called for senior living units equipped with kitchenettes, alongside amenities including a movie theater, spa and library. The proposal also promised to fill the void left by the hospital\u2019s closure with a new grocer, medical offices and a 23-room hotel for visiting families.\nBut Lockwood defaulted on $44.2 million in debt tied to the project, according to a foreclosure complaint filed by a lender last month in Cook County Circuit Court.\nThe developer\u2019s financial problems aren\u2019t confined to Chicago\u2019s south suburbs, court documents show. The Blue Island foreclosure is one of at least seven simultaneous alleged defaults totaling $178 million in troubled debt owed by Lockwood, exposing a portfolio-wide collapse for the firm led by\nCharles Everhardt\nand Edward Dovner.\n\u201cWe are doing a sale of all assets to a third party which the lender has approved,\u201d Everhardt said. He claimed the sale price will be more than the debt Lockwood owes.\nThe firm\u2019s hotel portfolio, including properties in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Tennessee and elsewhere, is being sold as a package to one buyer, while the Blue Island property is being sold separately to a data center developer, Everhardt said in an interview.\nHowever, he said he was unable to name the buyers or disclose exact pricing due to an agreement with the lender; the lawsuit doesn\u2019t mention a sale. \u201cThe foreclosure, as I understand, will be dismissed,\u201d he said.\nBlue Island city officials didn\u2019t return requests for comment. But Everhardt said data center development is the \u201chighest and best use\u201d for the former healthcare site.\n\u201cThere is fiber that runs across the railroad tracks adjacent to the property. And we have been able to secure a power solution,\u201d he said.\nThe lender pursuing foreclosure is an affiliate of Puyallup, Washington-based\nBuilders Capital\n, which originated nearly $32 million in loans to Lockwood\u2019s Blue Island project in 2022. Builders Capital later provided a second mortgage of more than $15 million to the project in 2024, but now almost all of the principal remains outstanding and is well past maturity, records show.\nAn attorney for Builders declined to comment.\nCapital Crunch\nBuilders, in its Dec. 19 complaint, claims Lockwood failed to pay off the principal balance by the loan\u2019s extended maturity date of March 31, 2025. The lender also accuses Lockwood of allowing unauthorized liens to pile up against the property, constituting additional violations of the loan agreement.\nThe suit marks a reversal of fortunes for a project that appeared to be finding its footing just over a year ago. In September 2024, Lockwood reportedly paid nearly $137,000 in outstanding bills to the city of Blue Island to settle code violations and clear the path for permits. At the time, city officials expressed cautious optimism that the delayed redevelopment was moving a step closer to reality.\nInstead, the project appears to have hit a financial wall.\nThe lender claims six other Lockwood loans are also in default.\nBlue Island, Illinois: $31.9 million original principal (now $44.2M due)\nMemphis, Tennessee: $28.9 million loan\nTulsa, Oklahoma: $28.9 million loan\nOrlando, Florida: $25.6 million loan\nDayton, Ohio: $23.5 million loan\nWyomissing, Pennsylvania: $21.3 million loan\nMarietta, Georgia: $17.8 million loan\nMost of these loans, like the Blue Island debt, matured in March 2025, according to legal documents. The Tulsa, Orlando, Dayton and Marietta loans appear to be for hotel properties Lockwood lists on its website\u2019s portfolio page. The Pennsylvania property is encountering similar issues to the Blue Island project, according to a September\nreport by SpotlightPA.org\n.\nLocal officials there moved to seize the vacant site via eminent domain in 2025, but a county committee voted in November to remove the property\u2019s \u201cblighted\u201d designation after ownership promised to install HVAC units to prevent the sprinkler system from freezing, according to the publication. The reprieve came despite objections from Wyomissing officials, who argued the long-shuttered hotel remained a safety hazard.\nIn Blue Island, the road to revamping the MetroSouth site has been rocky from the start, also plagued by delays and friction with city officials over property maintenance.The lender is asking the court to appoint a receiver to take immediate control of the Blue Island property and is pursuing a deficiency judgment against Everhardt and Dovner personally, alleging they waived their \u201cright of redemption\u201d \u2014 a move that could fast-track the property to a judicial sale. The foreclosure lawsuit is scheduled for a June 22 case management hearing, online court records show.\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s office market in 2025 topped a benchmark it hadn\u2019t touched since the pandemic cratered demand.\nTenants leased 10.3 million square feet of office space in downtown Chicago last year compared to an alltime low of 5.5 million square feet leased in 2020 at the height of the pandemic, historic data from Savills indicates. The 10 million square feet threshold hadn\u2019t been surpassed since 2019 until last year, according to a report from Savills rounding out 2025.\nData collected since 2020 shows leasing has inched upward each year, with 2025 coming closest to pre-pandemic leasing levels so far. In 2019, tenants leased 13 million square feet of office space in the central business district.\nThe progress is good news for\nthe beleaguered Loop\n.\nThe top office leasing transaction recorded by Savills in the last quarter of 2025 was the renewal and expansion of law firm\nBenesch Friedlander Coplan &amp; Aronoff\u2019s 130,000-square-foot\ndeal in Irvine Company\u2019s building at 71 South Wacker Drive. The law firm\u2019s lease grew by 33,000 in the new deal.\nAnother law firm, Ropes &amp; Gray,\nexpanded its space to 105,000 square feet\nat 191 North Wacker Drive, which is owned by Manulife. It previously occupied about 79,000 square feet in the building.\nStill, office landlords are hardly in the clear. Out of the full inventory of downtown office space, about 29.5 percent is available for rent. The percentage stayed nearly stagnant from 2024, when it came in at 29.4 percent, according to Savills.\nAnd\nforeclosure lawsuits continued to play out\namong big-name building owners and lenders in 2025, including landlord AmTrust and special servicer LNR Partners over the Illinois Center.\nLNR Partners\nfiled to foreclose\non the New York-based landlord\u2019s $260 million loan for the two-tower property at 111 East Wacker Drive and 233 North Michigan Avenue in 2024 and the legal dispute over the property is still ongoing.\nTrouble started when\nThe U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services vacated 170,000 square feet\nin 2023, leaving a hole in the 2.1 million-square-foot complex.\nSavills notes, however, that overall trends paint a better picture for the year ahead.\nAsking rents increased 5.1 percent year-over-year to $47.08 per square foot, with Class A rents rising to $55.23 per square foot.\nMeanwhile,\noffice-to-residential conversions\nare getting underway\nwith support from the city\n, helping to chip away at the glut of available workspace.\n",

        "content": "Matt Garrison isn\u2019t backing away from Chicago\u2019s distressed loft office market.\nHis Chicago-based firm R2 Cos. added another distressed River North loft to its portfolio.\nThe firm purchased the building at 225 West Illinois Street in late December, according to a social media post from R2 partner Zack Cupkovic.\nR2 paid $4.65 million for the 46,150-square-foot, five story building, Garrison told\nThe Real Deal.\nThe sale comes out to about $100 per square foot.\nWhile a deed detailing the sale is not yet available, the seller appears to be a subsidiary of State Farm Life Insurance, the lender that took over the building through a deed in lieu of foreclosure in October.\nThe building\u2019s previous owner, Leigh Rabman\u2019s RN Realty, surrendered the property to a subsidiary of State Farm in October, property records show. RN Realty took out an $8.5 million mortgage on the building in 2018, according to public documents.\nRabman and State Farm did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe acquisition is R2\u2019s latest play into\ndowntown loft workspace\n, keeping up its bet that distressed and\ndiscounted boutique offices\nwill rebound. A venture of R2 and its Chicago-based partner Cubed Real Estate\nacquired a similar building\ntwo blocks north, at 225 West Ohio Street, out of distress in August.\nGarrison said the firm is targeting well-positioned lofts in River North and West Loop to build its portfolio. The buildings offer a low-cost way to compete with larger office towers, he said.\n\u201cThey allow us to offer smaller spaces cost effectively, and the space is interesting and feels good. More like an apartment versus a cold tower,\u201d he said. \u201cMore importantly, the cost structure of these buildings is less than half of tower economics.\u201d\nR2 has also dabbled in the distressed office tower market, however. In early 2024, it bought the\n41-story building at 150 North Michigan Avenue\nin partnership with Anagram Capital and Italy\u2019s billionaire Garavoglia family, in a deal that marked a massive drop in value for the property. R2 and its partners paid just $60 million for the property, down from more than $121 million its previous owners had paid for it in 2017 before sinking $35 million more into renovations.\nAt 225 West Illinois, R2 plans to upgrade the building\u2019s lobby and restrooms, and put money into improving the office spaces, Garrison said.\nR2\u2019s confidence in the subsector comes against the backdrop of stubbornly high\ndowntown office vacancy rates\n, especially for Class B properties like the Illinois Street loft building. Vacancy rates in the Central Business District reached 28 percent in the third quarter of 2025, according to CBRE. At Class B spaces, the rate rose to 35 percent.\nProperty records show Rabman\u2019s firm acquired the building in 2000 from a trust administered by Cole Taylor Bank. While records don\u2019t indicate a purchase price for the long ago transaction, his firm took out a $5.5 million mortgage when it purchased the building.\nThe structure, which was built in 1976, was renovated in 2000, according to property details on Loopnet.\nRN Realty refinanced the property multiple times during its ownership. It took out a $5.25 million mortgage in 2010, then a $6.25 million mortgage in 2015. The last $8.5 million mortgage with State Farm landed the building in distress and led to the lender to take back the property through a deed in lieu of foreclosure, prior to R2\u2019s purchase.\n",

        "content": "A long-running fight over the West Austin Business Park might transform into a dramatic reset with a high-profile winner.\nAustin-based space communications startup CesiumAstro is in talks to buy the 23-acre,\nthree-building campus\nnear State Highway 71 and Sweetwater Village Drive, with plans to convert the controversial site into its global headquarters, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n. The 270,000-square-foot property, known as Lot 7, sits in Bee Cave\u2019s extraterritorial jurisdiction and has been at the center of a\nbitter legal dispute\nfor more than a year.\nNothing is signed yet.\nCesiumAstro\nexecutives cautioned on Monday that discussions are ongoing and that no deal has been finalized.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll share updates on any expansion once details are confirmed,\u201d CFO Ken Smith told the outlet.\nStill, the city of Bee Cave has already teed up a path forward. City officials announced that CesiumAstro is poised to acquire the property from\nDallas-based Velocis\n, which had partnered with\nKBC Advisors\non the development, as part of a settlement agreement aimed at resolving the lawsuit over the project. The\nBee Cave\nCity Council unanimously voted in December to advance an updated settlement after an executive session, though the agreement has not yet appeared in court filings.\nIf completed, the sale would largely end Bee Cave\u2019s clash with Velocis \u2014 and replace a feared warehouse hub with a fast-growing aerospace employer. City officials said CesiumAstro plans to use the campus for office space and assembly of satellite communications equipment, not distribution.\nThat distinction is central to the deal. Bee Cave sued in 2024, arguing the developers violated a 2015 development agreement by pushing an industrial warehouse project incompatible with nearby residential areas. Velocis disputed those claims. Under the amended agreement, warehouse and distribution uses are barred.\nPlans call for converting 76 loading docks into windows, leaving just four truck bays. According to city documents, truck traffic would be capped at eight 18-wheelers per month, down from what could have been hundreds per day. All deliveries would require 24-hour notice to Bee Cave police and escorted truck trips. The developers also agreed to donate $500,000 to the city.\nMayor Kara King framed the settlement in a statement as a community win, saying the new agreement amounted to a \u201cbetter outcome for our community than a last mile warehouse distribution center.\u201d\nThe settlement does not resolve all legal issues. Claims tied to the project against Bee Cave\u2019s former city manager, Clint Garza, remain set for trial in February.\nThe site could anchor CesiumAstro\u2019s next growth phase. The startup raised $65 million last year, on top of a $60 million round in 2022, and has secured defense contracts with the Space Development Agency and the U.S. Air Force, according to the publication. Headcount has doubled to more than 200, and the company has been openly scouting for room to expand its Austin presence.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A longtime fixture on San Antonio\u2019s Broadway corridor could soon be wiped from the map.\nLocal developer Harper/Huddleston filed for permission to demolish the building that housed the former Antiquarian Book Mart at 3127 Broadway, according to city records. The demolition request, submitted Dec. 31, is now under review by staff in the city\u2019s Office of Historic Preservation, with a response expected in February, the San Antonio Business Journal first\nreported\n.\nThe property sits within a River Improvement Overlay district, a zoning layer intended to protect the character and development patterns along the San Antonio River. While the overlay adds scrutiny, the proposal would not automatically trigger a hearing before the Historic and Design Review Commission unless city staff determines the project warrants additional review, according to the publication.\nHarper/Huddleston bought the property in 2023 from bookstore owner Bob Kellel, ending the run of the beloved Antiquarian Book Mart. The deal also included the adjacent Half Price Books building and parking lot. Both retailers closed shortly after the sale, clearing a sizable stretch of frontage along\nBroadway\n.\nThe developer has continued to quietly assemble property in the area. In March 2024, Harper/Huddleston also acquired the neighboring building at 3125 Broadway, home to W.D. Deli. The firm did not respond to requests for comment about its plans for the sites.\nAny demolition would add to the steady churn reshaping\nLower Broadway\n, a corridor increasingly defined by redevelopment and higher-density projects. Last fall, The DoSeum purchased nearby land once occupied by Good Time Charlie\u2019s and Taco Cabana for a potential expansion. Farther up Broadway, construction is underway on the first phase of Terry Black\u2019s BBQ\u2019s\nmixed-use project\n, which includes a restaurant, a three-story hotel with a spa and an underground parking garage at 2100 Broadway Street.\nLarger projects are also in the pipeline. GrayStreet Partners and Fulcrum Development are planning the 15-acre\nBESA District\nmixed-use development in Government Hill, while Sandstone Developments recently repositioned the aging Ranch Motel into a boutique hotel.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Development money is flowing near the nation\u2019s biggest university after\nTexas ended familial occupancy rules\n\u2014 and projects are facing a market shift that may follow the deregulation.\nAdam Development Properties is spending $45 million to build Copperfield Drive Apartments, a 360-unit development at 4251 Boonville Road in Bryan, part of the Texas A&amp;M University metropolitan area. The project is about five miles from campus.\nCollege Station-based Adam Development, led by Andrew Ball, director of real estate, and John Ben Blackburn, senior vice president, plans to start the project in March and complete it by January 2028, according to a plan filed in December with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. The estimated cost amounts to $125,000 per unit, though TDLR filings are preliminary and subject to change.\nIt\u2019s the most expensive\nmultifamily\nproject on record for Bryan. It\u2019s also the most expensive plan for multifamily or student housing filed since\nTexas\nended bans on \u201cstealth dorms,\u201d as one ordinance called them. Earlier this year, the legislature passed a prohibition on relationship-based occupancy codes in college towns with populations of less than 250,000 \u2014 a law aimed squarely at College Station and Bryan, home to Texas A&amp;M University and one of its feeder schools, Blinn College.\nWith an annual enrollment exceeding 70,000 students, Texas A&amp;M has the largest in-person student body in the country. However, in the past few years, College Station and Bryan enforced occupancy restrictions that forbade more than four unrelated people to share a home outside of certain permitted neighborhoods. In College Station, the \u201cno-more-than-four\u201d rule applied to apartments as well.\nAs part of a broader effort to free up housing supply\n, the legislature halted enforcement of these local ordinances beginning in September.\nThe end of the \u201cno-more-than-four\u201d rule presents an opportunity to rent to more occupants \u2014 and the market shows signs that property owners are taking it.\nIn November, the latest month on record for Zillow, area rents dropped by $7, month-over-month. While only a modest decline for the average renter, it\u2019s the first time since 2016 that rents declined at all in November \u2014 a notable skip in the college town\u2019s clockwork seasonal trends.\nAdditionally, in October, the month after the law took effect, the number of rental properties in the county jumped 18 percent, year-over-year, according to Realtor.com.\nAs a result, it\u2019s easier to fill five-bedroom or six-bedroom apartments in College Station. On the other hand, multifamily projects planned in advance of 2025 now face competition from an unleashed reserve of detached homes.\nAdam Development has owned the land slated for Copperfield Drive Apartments since 2003, according to public records. The company did not immediately respond for comment.Not long before the \u201cno-more-than-four\u201d rule ended, Texas developer Parallel also began work on a 23-story student housing building on Boyett Street with an estimated cost of $59 million, and Subtext started on a two-phase student housing development two blocks from campus, with the estimated cost of the first phase alone exceeding $60 million.\n",

        "content": "Bank OZK has found a buyer for a nine-figure construction loan backing a mostly empty life sciences campus in Southern California.\nThe lender sold a $265 million loan tied to Pacific Center, a 500,000-square-foot property at 9955 Pacific Heights Boulevard in northwestern San Diego, to Connecticut-based private equity firm\nStrategic Value Partners\n, Bisnow\nreported\n. Bank OZK\u2019s sale marks one of the largest whole-loan dispositions in the Arkansas-based bank\u2019s history. Though the loan is valued at $265 million, the exact amount Strategic Value Partners paid to acquire the debt package was not disclosed.\nChicago-based Sterling Bay completed development on the property last May. A joint venture between Sterling Bay and\nHarrison Street Real Estate\nsecured the loan in 2023 for the first phase of Pacific Center\u2019s construction, comprising two six-story buildings, an amenity center and a parking garage. A dearth of life sciences tenants as\nfederal funds \u2014 and tenant demand for space \u2014 dry up\nhas left the campus largely vacant. Several 37,000-square-foot suites are available for immediate occupancy, according to\nLoopNet\n.\nThe sale represents the latest time Bank OZK has seen a loan with Sterling Bay go south. In 2019, the bank provided the developer with a $128 million mortgage for land at the Lincoln Yards megaproject in Chicago, but seized the property last March\nfollowing the project\u2019s collapse\n. The parcel was sold\nto JDL Development\nin October for roughly $84 million, Bloomberg\nreported\n.\nPacific Center is in San Diego\u2019s Sorrento Mesa neighborhood, a life sciences hub in the city. More than 3 million square feet of life sciences space was available for rent at the end of the third quarter, representing about 40 percent of the market\u2019s entire inventory and more than any other neighborhood in San Diego, per CBRE data cited by Bisnow. The vacancy rate in the area was 35 percent at the end of the third quarter, well above the 23 percent average across all of San Diego\u2019s core markets.\nElsewhere in Sorrento Mesa, Bank OZK also provided Longfellow Real Estate Partners with a $202 million construction loan to build the 316,000-square-foot Bioterra life sciences property in 2022. The Bioterra development, like Pacific Center, is also facing vacancy and loan distress, per Bisnow.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s Thursday: Caravan day for agents in Altadena and Southern California\u2019s broader Foothills.\nAgents, who were out for a day of new listing previews, chatted over coffee at a cul-de-sac where a nearly finished home, expected to be the first developer-completed residence in Altadena early this year, was the draw.\nCompass agents Jeff Salcido and Mark Marquez hold the listing, at 3245 Arrowhead Court. It\u2019s priced just under $1.9 million and is one of 15 Altadena residences to be built by the developer New Pointe Communities.\nSalcido\u2019s brother and sister-in-law once lived there. But in April, they decided to sell the lot to New Pointe for $635,000.\n\u201cThey had a baby on the way, and trying to have your first baby, rebuilding and going through the whole process was just a bit more than they wanted to take on,\u201d Salcido said. \u201cFor them, it was a really hard decision.\u201d\nAside from the backstory, and the fact that the neighboring properties are dirt lots, burned by last January\u2019s Eaton Fire, the agent gathering would have been unremarkable.\nBut those lots are now primed for rebuilding, a sign of the effort that has gone into the recovery\nsince the\nPalisades and Eaton fires destroyed a combined 16,000 single-family and commercial structures a year ago.\nNow, green shoots are turning into a broader comeback, as real estate surveys the progress \u2014 what\u2019s sold and what\u2019s being built \u2014 and property owners make their own decisions to move forward on new homes, or move away. So far, the permitting pipeline is in sync with that activity, and developers are keeping up, although some wonder what 2026 holds, as the pace picks up.\nNearly 3,600 residential properties in the Eaton and\nPalisades\nfires\u2019 burn zones have already filed for permits related to rebuilding between Feb. 1 and Dec. 8,\u00a0 according to an analysis of Los Angeles County data by\nTRD\nData.\n\u201cIt could be a 1,000-square-foot cottage or an 8,000-square-foot architecturally significant home, as long as there are no conflicts to code and everything\u2019s buttoned up, you\u2019re going to get approval.\u201d\nMatt McRoskey, steel framing supplier\nAltadena appears to be moving at a faster clip, accounting for 40 percent of the total properties seeking permits. Pacific Palisades accounts for 15 percent, while Malibu is 9 percent, according to\nTRD\nData.\nClosings offer another view of what\u2019s moving and for how much. Market watchers are waiting for land sales to bottom out and an upward trajectory in values to become clear.\nPerhaps not surprisingly, Malibu lays claim to the priciest lot sale post-fires, according to a review of Zillow records. The deal, one-third of an acre at Carbon Beach, closed in August for $14 million; it\u2019s located at\n22102 Pacific Coast Highway\n. At one time, it held a nearly 5,000-square-foot home with 60 feet fronting the ocean.\nThe Palisades\u2019 priciest lot sale since the fires, 1511 Old Oak Road, closed in September for $9.4 million.\nBuyers can get more for their money in Altadena, where the community\u2019s priciest lot sale was in November for $2.1 million. The nearly 1-acre lot at 1625 Braeburn Road sits just above the Altadena Golf Course in the Country Club neighborhood.\nP\nermit prognosis\nSpreadsheets alone suggest a seemingly daunting multi-year construction process: If some Woolsey Fire residents in Malibu are only just now moving into their rebuilt homes, seven years after that blaze, what\u2019s in store for Palisades and Eaton survivors?\nAt the heart of that answer is whether the expedited permitting process promised post-fires is working. By all accounts, it\u2019s so far, so good \u2014 despite some very loud criticisms of bureaucratic inertia in various aspects of the recovery.\nDeveloper Rick Caruso has been unfiltered in his critiques, but on a Friday in December, he was nothing but smiles and praise for Thomas James Homes executives celebrating the completion of their first Palisades rebuild at 915 Kagawa Street, which is partially the result of an expedited permitting process.\nThe developer \u2014 dressed in a crisp white shirt under a navy blazer, black slacks and double-monk strap shoes \u2014 was on site to lend his support to the project, a Thomas James Homes spokesperson said.\nSome in the rebuild effort qualify the critiques with the reality that construction simply takes time. In Malibu and certain parts of the Palisades, rocky hillsides, sandy beaches and other challenging terrain can tack more time onto a project than you\u2019d need with simple, flat lots. That\u2019s on top of the human element, where many homeowners have only reached the point, a year later, where they\u2019re ready for the design phase.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very early in the Palisades,\u201d Matt McRoskey, founder of steel framing supplier Ghost Factory, said. \u201cA lot of folks needed to take some time. They needed six months to land their long-term rental, to get their inventory lists and they weren\u2019t even thinking about hiring architects for the first six to 12 months. But now they\u2019re ready.\u201d\nGhost Factory\u2019s steel is forming the new bones for entrepreneur Lisa Price\u2019s home at 854 Galloway Street, about three blocks away from the Kagawa Street property.\nMcRoskey came into the project after Price had already pulled a permit to build with wood. His firm had to apply for a supplemental permit for the change.\nThe application was 300 pages of engineering calculations, followed by a 30-minute in-person meeting at the permit office. Ghost Factory warned Price that approval might take weeks, or even months.\nInstead, the office granted the change in seven days, according to McRoskey who has since submitted plans for two other homes, including a 2,500-square-foot home along Sunset Boulevard in the Palisades\u2019 Huntington neighborhood and an over 4,000-square-foot property near Palisades Charter High School.\nMcRoskey, who grew up in the Palisades, said his parents and other relatives in the community are in talks with architects and will eventually turn to Ghost Factory once their designs advance.\nHe finds the permit system is working well, regardless of a project\u2019s size or complexity.\n\u201cIt could be a 1,000-square-foot cottage or an 8,000-square-foot architecturally significant home, as long as there are no conflicts to code and everything\u2019s buttoned up, you\u2019re going to get approval,\u201d he said.\nIn many instances, he pointed out, delays can be self-inflicted, since an understaffed L.A. Department of Building and Safety is not new.\nThomas James Homes CEO James Mead touted his firm\u2019s efficient permitting record to press outside his company\u2019s Kagawa Street property. Its average permitting time with the city of Los Angeles is less than 60 days.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t entirely about a streamlined process,\u201d Mead said. \u201cI think the city is really trying hard. It\u2019s about what you can do if you\u2019ve got a professional approach to permitting.\u201d\nNew Pointe founder and President Scot Sandstrom said about as much in the case of Altadena, where permitting is done through L.A. County. While the typical permit process is a year, the Arrowhead Court property that brought the Compass caravan out in December was permitted in four months.\nSandstrom said he has nothing but praise for the county, despite some of the negative chatter.\n\u201cI understand for people who have never built a home, how it can be difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cHomes are complex.\u201d\nThe unknown now is whether the system can support the expected flood of permits this year.\n\u201cSo it\u2019s going to start getting extremely busy in the first half of 2026 and it will be interesting to see how the city reacts,\u201d McRoskey said. \u201cThe department will get absolutely flooded at some point.\u201d\nL\narge or small\nIf anyone was keeping score on first completions in the burn zones, it would seem the larger developers have command of the race.\nThose firms would argue that\u2019s where their building expertise shines.\nIn Thomas James Homes\u2019 case, Mead touted the company\u2019s single-lot experience. That is, its skill in building individual homes as opposed to tract housing in master-planned communities.\nThe CEO estimated the company could be under construction on more than 100 homes next year, with the bulk of that work done as early as the end of 2026. It\u2019s promising a starting price of $650 per square foot in construction costs.\nMany rebuilding with other developers have said quotes are well above $1,000 per square foot, as materials sourcing and supply chains lurch under the strain of tariffs, increased demand and other factors.\nAt New Pointe, the company has the added experience of rebuilding post-fires, going back to San Diego County\u2019s Witch Creek Fire. Those flames broke out in October 2007 and burned more than 1,000 homes.\nNew Pointe initially bought 16 lots in six neighborhoods after the fires and rebuilt those properties.\nNow, it\u2019s doing the same in Altadena, purchasing lots from homeowners like Salcido\u2019s brother and sister-in-law, who are unable to move forward with rebuilding.\nIt\u2019s a touchy subject, given the negative pall cast around\ncorporates\nbuying lots across the burn zones.\n\u201cThere\u2019s room for both,\u201d Sandstrom said of the role of large homebuilders and individual homeowners in a speedy recovery. \u201cThere are 4,000 homes here that need to be rebuilt. We need everybody to be a part of it. Not just homeowners rebuilding or builders rebuilding.\u201d",

        "content": "Almost two years after\nbeing indicted\n, Omnibuild and its former CEO John Mingione are finally nearing a trial date for their alleged roles in a $86 million fraud scheme.\nThe New York construction firm and Mingione reached a tentative agreement with the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office for a trial in April, which could last six to eight weeks.\nProsecutors said they recently completed their discovery, consisting of at least 470,000 documents.\n\u201cI suppose we\u2019re ready to go to trial,\u201d said Christopher Beard, an assistant District Attorney, during a hearing in front of Judge Ann Thompson in December.\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s office alleged in early 2024 that Mingione and Omnibuild participated in a multimillion-dollar fraud scheme spearheaded by former HFZ Capital Group executive Nir Meir to inflate invoices at the XI, a twisting condo project on the High Line. The D.A.\u2019s office charged Omnibuild and Mingione with grand larceny.\nBut since the start, Mingione and Omnibuild have maintained their innocence. They argued they were victims of the Meir and HFZ Capital\u2019s bad acts. (Kevin Stewart, a former accountant at Omnibuild, was also charged for his role in the scheme.)\n\u201cOmnibuild voluntarily assisted the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office for months,\u201d said Omnibuild\u2019s civil attorney John Ruggiero. \u201cDespite that good-faith cooperation, and correspondence from the District Attorney\u2019s office confirming Omnibuild\u2019s status as a victim, the District Attorney\u2019s office ultimately chose to rely on a small number of self-interested cooperators who sought to avoid prosecution by shifting blame onto Omnibuild and Mr. Mingione.\u201d\nRuggiero also said the District Attorney\u2019s office has excluded \u201cexculpatory evidence\u201d from its discovery production.\nThe D.A.\u2019s office said in a response that it \u201cwill respond to any defense motions in court filings.\u201d\nMingione and Omnibuild were eager to set a trial date. Omnibuild\u2019s criminal defense attorney Eric Snyder said the company\u2019s stock option plan has dropped to a fraction of its former value.\n\u201cThe company can\u2019t get jobs. They can\u2019t work. HPD [Housing Preservation Department] is holding up their work,\u201d said Snyder at the hearing in December. \u201cIt\u2019s destructive, it\u2019s devastating. It\u2019s choking off the company of these employees.\u201d\nIn 2024, Omnibuild\u2019s\nemployees claimed\nthat the indictment alone led to $1 billion in losses.\nSnyder pleaded with the court to hold the April trial date in place.\n\u201cWe want to keep this date. If it moves again, it\u2019s going to be the company dying on the vine,\u201d he said.\nThe case has dragged on since February 2024, when the charges were first announced against Meir, Mingione, Stewart, Omnibuild, HFZ, a former Omnibuild employee and two former HFZ employees.\nProsecutors leveled the most serious charges against Meir. The D.A.\u2019s office alleged Meir diverted millions of dollars from HFZ\u2019s real estate projects only to return the money with sizable shortfalls. Meir was also accused of defrauding New York City out of $15 million in taxes.\nMeir was fired from luxury real estate developer HFZ in December 2020, as the firm was\nlosing its high-profile projects\nto foreclosure. Meir\u2019s former boss Ziel Feldman blamed Meir for the firm\u2019s collapse in a scathing lawsuit. As Meir fended off lawsuits from HFZ creditors, he hunkered down in a Miami Beach estate, paying $150,000 per month in rent, until he was arrested in a hotel room at the 1 Hotel South Beach and extradited to New York in February 2024.\nMeir, who has pleaded not guilty, is now on his third attorney.\nHe was initially held without bail and held on Rikers Island for nearly a year before being released in March 2025 on a reduced bail package of $1 million. Just weeks later the judge claimed Meir violated the terms of his bail and sent him back to jail.\nMeir was released in June, but with electronic monitoring and restricted to the confines of a New York apartment.\nMeanwhile, HFZ Capital, two of its former employees, including their head of construction, and a former Omnibuild employee have pleaded guilty to various charges. None of the defendants who pleaded guilty were given jail sentences.\nAt the December hearing, the D.A\u2019s office said it has sent over a certificate of compliance to Meir\u2019s lawyer for his four indictments, meaning the prosecutors have provided all discovery and a trial date appears imminent.\nMeir will be tried separately from Omnibuild and Mingione.\nAt the end of the December hearing with Omnibuild and Mingione\u2019s lawyers present, the judge suggested the parties look at an alternative resolution other than a trial.\n\u201cI will always encourage a disposition, if there\u2019s any way toward a disposition\u2026 in much the way\u2026 that we ask jurors to consider the views of their fellow jurors, and don\u2019t be so wedded to their position, I ask that of all of you,\u201d said Thompson.\n",

        "content": "Turkish developer Okan Group scored $200 million in C-PACE financing for its Hilton-branded condo-hotel tower under construction in downtown Miami.\nThe lender is Coral Gables-based Bayview PACE. C-PACE stands for Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy, which encourages the use of energy efficient and sustainable materials and design. Bayview PACE\u2019s recent deals include\n$180 million in C-PACE\ndebt provided for North Development\u2019s Domus Brickell Center.\nOkan, a planned 70-story mixed-use high-rise at 555 North Miami Avenue, is on the 40th floor of construction. The building will be 903 feet tall once completed in 2028, according to a news release. When completed, Okan Tower will include a 316-key Hilton hotel, 236 condo-hotel units managed by Hilton, 163 condos, more than 80,000 square feet of amenities and 56,000 square feet of office space.\nMichael Sadov of Fortune Development Sales is leading sales of the project. The developer\nannounced it was eligible\nto raise EB-5 funds last fall.\nOkan Tower will also have a 429-space parking garage. Behar Font &amp; Partners designed the building, which will mark Okan\u2019s first in the U.S. The Turkey-based company has holdings in healthcare, finance, food, textiles, tourism, energy, education and real estate, including general contractor Okan Construction.\nOkan has self-funded construction of the project so far. The developer paused the project in 2020 as a result of the pandemic and\nrelaunched\nsales the following year. An Okan affiliate\npaid $18.1 million\nfor the 0.8-acre development site in 2017. It\u2019s surrounded by other new developments, including the Crosby at Miami Worldcenter and Melo Group\u2019s Downtown 6th.\nA number of multifamily and condo developers have recently secured large loans that include C-PACE financing. In November, Naftali closed\non $465 million in financing\nfor its JEM Private Residences tower at Miami Worldcenter, consisting of $235 million in C-PACE financing from Nuveen Green Capital and $230 million in traditional construction loans from BHI, the U.S. arm of Bank Hapoalim.\n",

        "content": "A 1920s-built,\nBel-Air\nestate designed by the same architect behind the Beverly Hills Hotel led the pack of last week\u2019s signed contracts kicking off the new year.\nThe home at 259 Saint Pierre Road sat in the top spot on the\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\nfor the seven-day period ended Jan. 4. The\nweekly roundup\nis produced by Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team and includes properties within L.A. County listed for $4 million or more.\nThe Elmer Grey-designed home first hit the market in March for $30.5 million or $3,456 per square foot, according to Zillow records.\nProperty records show the seller is an entity called Leeland Holdings International Inc., registered in the Bahamas.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019 David Parnes and Keller Williams Beverly Hills\u2019 Greg Moore hold the listing.\nParnes and Moore are also the listing agents for 234 Saint Pierre Road. The mid-century modern abode sits next door and is listed for $18.5 million, or $3,631 per square foot.\nThe Saint Pierre residence that fell into contract last week counts eight bedrooms and a dozen bathrooms.\nThe Tudor Revival-style home includes an 8,825-square-foot main home, guest home of over 7,000 square feet and a more than 2,000-square-foot outpost for staff or security. In all, the structures sit on more than 2 acres, with walking trails, patios, two pools, a sport court and two gated driveways.\nLast week\u2019s next priciest home to go into contract was 1947 Glencoe Way in the Hollywood Hills.\nThe six-bed, seven-bath home spans over 6,600 square feet and is listed for $6.5 million, or $984 per square foot.\nRecords show the property went into default in September, with $1.4 million owed as of Aug. 11. The seller is Kenny E. Hanna Jr., according to records obtained through PropertyShark.\nStandard Home Realty\u2019s Brandon Guerrero has the listing.\nBuilt in 2022, the home boasts a primary suite that spans an entire floor with a walk-in closet, patio and its own staircase leading to the pool. Other highlights include a waterfall feature with the infinity pool, BBQ area and elevator.\nA total of five properties went into contract last week in L.A. County, which was on par with the year-ago period, the\nEklund Gomes team reported\n. That added up to $44.8 million in asking volume, which was off about 42 percent from the comparable seven-day period a year ago.\nA possible bright spot in the market is on the supply side.\nLast year ended with 939 homes available for sale in the county, according to the Eklund Gomes report. That\u2019s up slightly from the 875 listings in active inventory that kicked off the start of 2025 and is down from the nearly 1,600 homes available for sale at the most recent peak in mid-June. The clearing of for-sale inventory could signal the start of a swing to a seller\u2019s market for the county should the trend continue.\n",

The lease was signed before the end of the fourth quarter and was disclosed in a Savills report.\nDetails of the lease were not disclosed, though the deal is said to be long-term as Natixis relocates from 1251 Sixth Avenue. Asking rents at its new digs range from $64 to $84 per square foot.\nCushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s Robert Lowe brokered the lease.\nIn case it wasn\u2019t already clear, Rithm owns 1633 Broadway, as well as a handful of other buildings formerly in the hands of Paramount.\nLast month, Behler \u2014 the longtime chief executive officer and chair of Paramount \u2014 was escorted out when he showed up to his old office at 1633 Broadway despite no longer being employed at the company, according to sources familiar with the matter. The incident came on Rithm\u2019s first day as Paramount\u2019s owner, though a source close to Behler claimed he believed the morning of the saga was actually his last day.\nParamount reached an agreement to sell the firm to Rithm for $1.6 billion, or $6.60 per share, last year following an intense multi-round bidding process. Dubai-based Saray Capital, which owned a 5.4 percent stake in Paramount, tried to make a last-minute offer for $6.95 per share. But shareholders ultimately approved Rithm\u2019s bid.\nIn a press release announcing the closing of its deal, Rithm said that Behler \u201cis departing the company,\u201d but did not offer any additional details.\nParamount controlled 13 million square feet of office space in New York and San Francisco.\nManhattan\noffice leasing\nreached pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter, according to Colliers, posting its strongest quarter since late 2019. That quarter contributed to a yearly total of nearly 42 million square feet for the highest total since 2019.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

TF Cornerstone\u2019s recently-completed luxury\nLong Island City multifamily development\nlanded the month\u2019s largest deal, a $347 million refi from M &amp; T Realty Capital. Apartment projects in Long Island City, Williamsburg and Gowanus also pulled in fresh capital, while debt flowed to a shelter-heavy portfolio in the Bronx and Queens and student housing in Brooklyn Heights.\nHere are November\u2019s top five outer borough loans.\nMalt money | $347M | Long Island City\nM &amp; T Realty Capital Corporation\nprovided a $347 million loan to refinance TF Cornerstone\u2019s luxury waterfront Long Island City apartment tower. The loan for the 575-unit building at 2-20 Malt Drive is backed by Fannie Mae\u2019s Near Stabilization program,\naccording to M &amp; T\n. The fresh financing replaced a $307 million loan from PNC Bank. The building is one of two luxury towers in the Malt Drive complex, built on the former site of a sugar cane processing facility and beer distribution center. Amenities include an outdoor pool, roof deck and fitness center. Leasing for the studio, one- and two-bedroom units launched in 2024.\nLorimer loot | $290M | Williamsburg\nBlackstone and Corebridge Financial\nprovided a $190 million loan to refinance the Loketch Group, Joyland Group and Meral Property Group\u2019s new multifamily development in Williamsburg.

Hawkins Way bought the properties in 2017 for $18 million from the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and converted them to student housing for St. Francis College. V\u00e4rde Partners became part owner of the property in 2021.

        "content": "Downtown West Palm Beach\u2019s office market is booming. But not everyone can afford to stay.\nBillionaire Steve Ross\u2019 hefty office investment and development in downtown West Palm supercharged the market, aligning with city and county boosters\u2019 vision for growth. And Ross\u2019 towers have become a magnet for tenants.\nAs Ross\u2019 investment increased rents across downtown West Palm, including in buildings he doesn\u2019t own, some longtime area tenants have been priced out, leading them to seek space in suburban Palm Beach County areas, the Palm Beach Post\nreported\n. Development in these less flashy submarkets also is picking up, the outlet\nreported\n.\nLaw firm Lytal, Reiter, Smith, Ivey &amp; Fronrath moved the majority of its office to Palm Beach Gardens last year from its space at downtown West Palm\u2019s\nNorthbridge Centre\n, where it was a tenant for four decades.\nVanderbilt Office Properties and Trinity Capital Advisors own Northbridge.\n\u201cThe proposed renewal rate was three to four times what we were paying,\u201d Lytal Reiter\u2019s Kevin Ryan told the publication, saying downtown rates are \u201cout of control.\u201d\nLytal Reiter, which focuses on personal injury and medical malpractice, opened its Palm Beach Gardens office at 4300 TBC Way.\nOthers are looking to make the move after getting sticker shock from the over $100 per square foot rents in downtown West Palm, according to Neil Merin of NAI/Merin Hunter Codman.\nAt least two office projects are on tap in suburban Palm Beach County.\nGatsby Florida, an arm of Gatsby Enterprises, plans the eight-story, 220,000-square-foot office building,\nThe Modern\n, and an adjacent six-story garage at 11200 RCA Center Drive in Palm Beach Gardens.\nShortly after last year\u2019s election in New York, Babak Ebrahimzadeh of Gatsby Florida told\nThe Real Deal\nthat the project partly will target New Yorkers moving to South Florida following Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani\u2019s mayoral win.\nConstruction completion of The Modern is expected in 2027.\nGatsby paid\n$17.5 million\nin 2022 for the development site, which is near the firm\u2019s\nDiVosta Towers\noffice complex.\nIn Boca Raton, the two-building, 140,000-square-foot\nThe Aletto\noffice complex is under construction and about 60 percent pre-leased.\nThese office developments are partly driven by demand for top tier offices in the suburbs, developers and brokers told the outlet.\nRoss, 85, stepped back from New York-based Related Companies, which he founded over 50 years ago, in 2024 to start and lead West Palm-based Related Ross. That firm primarily focuses on downtown West Palm. Ross, owner of the Formula One Race and the Miami Dolphins, also has completed and is developing condos, apartments and hotels in West Palm. He has about a\ndozen office buildings\nin the submarket, including those purchased, completed, under construction and planned.\nHe tapped his New York network to quickly tenant his office buildings, primarily with out-of-state financial services firms. More recently,\nRelated Ross\nalso has made a push to turn Palm Beach County into a tech hub.\nRoss remains nonexecutive chairman of Related Companies and its biggest single shareholder.\n\u2013\u2013\nLidia Dinkova\n",

        "content": "Another wealthy local buyer just surfaced from Ken Griffin\u2019s retreat from Chicago\u2019s luxury condo market.\nCharlie Mills, chairman and former CEO of Northfield-based Medline Industries, was the buyer who paid $7.4 million in April for Griffin\u2019s full-floor unit on the 35th floor of the Gold Coast tower at 9 West Walton Street. The Chicago Tribune\nreported\nthat Mills and his wife are now planning to sink another $2.75 million into building out the raw space, according to a building permit recently filed with the city.\nThe deal, first reported by Elite Street, marks a sharp haircut from Griffin\u2019s original bet on the building. The\nCitadel founder\npaid $12.5 million in 2017 for the 7,327-square-foot unit, part of a broader buying spree that included the building\u2019s top four floors. Griffin never built out the space, leaving it unfinished even as he shelled out $58.75 million for the combined upper floors.\nAfter announcing in 2022 that he was moving both his hedge fund empire and his personal residence to Florida,\nGriffin\nbegan unwinding his Chicago holdings. The four floors ultimately sold for a combined $34.9 million, a loss of more than 40 percent from his purchase price.\nThe 35th-floor condo had a particularly bumpy ride. Griffin first listed it in 2022 for $14 million, pulled it from the market the following year, then quietly sold it off-market in April 2025 to a land trust that concealed the buyer\u2019s identity. A December permit, however, names Mills as the current owner and shows he hired architect Michael Waechter and Wujcik Construction to handle the initial buildout, according to the Tribune.\nAlso on the upper floors of the building, Illinois\nGov. JB Pritzker\npaid $19 million in 2024 for the building\u2019s top two floors, also acquired from Griffin, though he has yet to file permits for his own buildout. Another Griffin unit, the 36th floor, sold in April for $8.5 million, but the buyer remains unknown.\nMedline\nwent public in December, four years after the Mills family sold a majority stake in the medical supply giant to private equity firms, giving the former CEO plenty of dry powder for a high-end Chicago homecoming.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The 20-year deal gives Starr floors 16 through 27 and accounts for about 30 percent of the 930,000-square-foot building. The landlord did not disclose the asking rent.\nThe lease marks a big win for BXP, which started construction without a significant amount of the space pre-leased. Starr will use the space as its New York headquarters, expanding and relocating from another BXP building at 399 Park Avenue. The firm\nsigned a lease in May\nfor 49,000-square-feet at Silverstein Properties\u2019 1177 Sixth Avenue and will continue to occupy that space.\nCushman &amp;\u00a0 Wakefield\u2019s John Picco, Peter Van Duyne and Alex Lachmund represented Starr in the deal. A CBRE team including Peter Turchin, John Maher and Evan Haskell represented the landlord.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in October that Starr was\nin agreement\nto lease roughly a third of the development, but neither company would comment. The deal is the latest sign that large tenants are willing to lock in long-term leases for Class A office space in core locations as New York\u2019s office market\ncontinues to rebound\npost-pandemic.\nThe development of 343 Madison has been fraught with financial challenges. In September, BXP\nlowered its dividend\nby 30 percent to help pay for the\n$2 billion office tower\n, searching for $50 million in quarterly savings.\nThe development site of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s former headquarters suffered a blow last summer when Norges Bank\nbacked out of a plan to be a 45 percent partner\nin the project.\nSince then, BXP has been searching for a partner to pick up as much as half of the development cost. CEO Owen Thomas has said that BXP\u2019s costs could drop to $500 million under that scenario.\n",

        "content": "Boca Raton officials moved to tighten oversight of city land deals, approving an ordinance that requires two public hearings and findings that justify how the deals will help the public.\nThe measure, approved by the city council Tuesday night by a vote of 3 to 1, was approved more than a month after a\njudge blocked a proposed referendum\nthat would have required any sale or lease of public land larger than a half-acre to be approved by Boca Raton voters instead of just elected officials.\nThe blocked referendum, which garnered thousands of signatures from registered voters, and the new city law were inspired by a pending 99-year lease deal with David Martin\u2019s Terra and Palm Beach-based Frisbie Group that would enable them to build a 1.15-million-square-foot mixed-use community near Brightline\u2019s Boca Raton station, a deal that has already been backed by the\ncity\u2019s planning and zoning board\n.\nBrandon Schaad, director of development services, said the new city code creates a \u201chigher standard\u201d for the sale or transfer of city land. Among other things, the city now requires that people within 500 feet of a half-acre property under consideration for sale or lease be notified 10 days prior to the first hearing.\nThe transaction would also have to accomplish a public purpose, such as revenue for the city, substantial community benefits, or a project that would enhance recreational, cultural or economic opportunities for residents, according to the ordinance.\nThe new code specifies that this won\u2019t apply to easements or right-of-way conveyances needed for utilities and other public purposes. It also won\u2019t impact renewals and extensions of already approved leases where \u201cthe underlying public purpose continues to be served.\u201d\nJon Pearlman, founder of Save Boca, said the ordinance was drafted by Mayor Scott Singer to \u201cmimic\u201d a law pushed by his grassroots organization that would have required such deals to be ratified by voters. Although Save Boca\u2019s petition drive for such a referendum attracted thousands of voters, it was declared unconstitutional in late November by Palm Beach County Circuit Court Judge Joseph Curley following a lawsuit from Boca Raton attorney Ned Kimmelman. Pearlman said the judge\u2019s ruling is under appeal.\n\u201cThe bottom line is that [the city ordinance] does not put the power of disposition of city land, the sale of city lands and the lease of city lands, in the hands of the people, which the Save Boca laws do,\u201d Pearlman said.\nSinger, though, said his proposed ordinance marked an improvement over the status quo.\n\u201cWe should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good,\u201d the mayor said.\nBut Councilmember Andy Thomson, a critic of the One Boca project, said he didn\u2019t see the Singer\u2019s proposed ordinance as \u201cmeaningful.\u201d He voted against it.\nAlthough a referendum on future city land deals has so far been stopped, the council, Terra and Frisbie agreed last year to hold a referendum on the One Boca project on March 10.\nBoca Raton voters will have final say on One Boca, but city officials are still moving forward with the process. At this week\u2019s meeting, the council also introduced an ordinance to approve a 99-year lease deal with Terra and Frisbie.\nUnder their current plans, Terra and Frisbie would build three buildings, up to 130 feet tall, that would consist of 947 condos and apartments, 120,000 square feet of office, 79,100 square feet of retail, a 30,000-square-foot grocery store, and a 180-room hotel on 7.8 acres of mostly public land at approximately Northwest Second Avenue and Northwest Fourth Street, Deputy City Manager Andrew Lukasik said. The deal would include Terra and Frisbie reviving the 17-acre city hall campus, which is scheduled to come back for second reading on Jan. 20.\nThe proposed development has been evolving ever since Boca Raton officials picked Terra and Frisbie over four other contenders nearly a year ago to redevelop its city hall campus. Back then, Terra and Frisbie\u2019s proposed project spanned\n2.5 million square feet\n, which was later reduced to about 1.5 million square feet. Following vocal opposition from hundreds of residents, Terra and Frisbie agreed to further\nscale back\ntheir project and limit it to the east side of Northwest Second Avenue.\n",

        "content": "One of the original office buildings in Dallas\u2019 Harwood District has a new owner, adding another chapter to the slow-motion reshuffling of one of Uptown\u2019s most distinctive office enclaves.\nDallas-based Cawley Partners acquired Harwood No. 1, a seven-story, roughly 106,000-square-foot office building at 2651 North Harwood Street, and plans to renovate the property in the first half of the year. The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat the deal closed Dec. 30 and was announced Jan. 6, according to a statement from the buyer.\nThe building, developed in 1982 by Harwood International, was the first office project in the 19-block district and was originally built for Swiss luxury watchmaker Rolex. The building is about 50 percent leased, with tenants including Cadence Bank, Huron Consulting Group and Unifeye Vision Partners.\nFinancial terms weren\u2019t disclosed, but the Dallas Central Appraisal District last valued the property at $25 million, including about $7.6 million for the land. First United Bank sold the building after regaining control through a November\nforeclosure auction\n, where it posted a winning bid of $27.2 million, according to public records.\nThe sale comes amid mounting pressure on Harwood International, the firm led by Gabriel Barbier-Mueller that spent decades assembling and curating the district at the seam of Uptown and Victory Park. Over the past year, several Harwood buildings have traded hands, often at moments of financial distress. In 2024, Harwood sold\nfour office buildings\n\u2014 Harwood No. 2, 6, 7 and 10 \u2014 totaling nearly 900,000 square feet to private equity giant TPG.\nLate last year, law firm K&amp;L Gates signed on at Harwood No. 4, a tower known for its Asian art-filled lobby. But uncertainty still hangs over future development. Harwood landed a $100 million loan from TPG\u2019s real estate arm to jump-start construction of Harwood No. 15, though that project has yet to break ground after Jones Day, long expected to be the anchor tenant, backed out,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously\nreported\n.\nCawley Partners, best known for suburban office developments along the Dallas North Tollway in Plano and\nFrisco\n, plans to overhaul the lobby, corridors, restrooms and top-floor lounge, as well as build out roughly 50,000 square feet of spec suites. Renovation work is expected to begin late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter, a spokesperson told the publication.\nThe building still bears a nod to its origins, with a Rolex clock in the atrium, even though the watchmaker later decamped to another Harwood tower.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "When Gov. Kathy Hochul stood on a stage a year ago, praising the real estate industry and musing that any elected official absent from the Real Estate Board of New York\u2019s annual gala was \u201cmissing a damn good party,\u201d then-mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani was on the street outside the event.\nThe protestors with whom he gathered held signs that read \u201cRent Freeze\u201d and \u201cREBNY Raised My Rent.\u201d\nA lot has happened since that party. Mamdani now acknowledges that his view of the private sector\u2019s role in the housing market has shifted, making his case to the city\u2019s business community in closed-door meetings. Hochul endorsed Mamdani in September and seems more open than in the past to raising the money the new mayor needs to fund key parts of his agenda.\nAs Mamdani begins his term and Hochul intensifies her reelection campaign, their attempts not to alienate the constituents on either side at last year\u2019s REBNY gala has generated a powerful dynamic, not just for Mamdani\u2019s early days or Hochul\u2019s chances at reelection, but also for what legislation will get done this year and how real estate industry priorities will fare.\nG\nood alternatives\nAt least rhetorically, the mayor is likely to play a big part in the governor\u2019s race.\nMamdani has pitched raising taxes on the city\u2019s highest earners and corporations to fund universal childcare and free buses. Hochul has been against both, though reportedly she has softened on corporate tax rate increases.\nDoing so, however, threatens to anger high-earning donors, including those\nin the real estate industry\n. They could turn to Trump-backed Republican Nassau executive Bruce Blakeman, one challenger. Another, Rep. Elise Stefanik, announced in December that she was dropping out of the race.\n\u201cYou have two strong Republicans running against the governor, both very close to Trump,\u201d lobbyist Suri Kasirer said during an interview before Stefanik dropped out. \u201cTheir argument is likely going to be: We\u2019re close to Trump, and we can prevent the policies that Zohran has promised.\u201d\nAnd for those who supported Mamdani, there\u2019s Lieutenant Gov. Antonio Delgado, who has also used Mamdani as a lodestar, telling Politico that he viewed Mamdani\u2019s win as a \u201cconfirmation\u201d of his run for governor. A \u201cbig reason\u201d he is running is that he believes \u201cthe status quo is broken.\u201d\nBeyond the governor\u2019s race, political events this year could show where the Democratic party stands in New York. In the wake of Mamdani\u2019s win, moderate candidates saw early success in key contests, at times with the help of the mayor-elect.\nFor example, Council member Julie Menin declared victory in the City Council speaker\u2019s race even before she officially won on Jan. 7. And Council member Chi Oss\u00e9 backed off his bid to challenge House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, after failing to secure support from the Democratic Socialists of America. Mamdani reportedly urged the DSA against endorsing Oss\u00e9.\nMamdani also endorsed City Comptroller Brad Lander, who is running to unseat Rep. Dan Goldman over the DSA-endorsed Council Member Alexa Avil\u00e9s, who has decided not to run.\nN\not a housing year\nHochul\u2019s primary and general election challenges, as well as the danger of angering the voters who made Mamdani mayor, could influence what policies the governor and the state legislature tackle.\n\u201cBecause of that push and pull on either side, I\u2019m not confident that a lot will get done on housing this year,\u201d George Fontas, a lobbyist whose firm represented a coalition that fought against the\ngood cause eviction\nbill, said. (A version of the bill passed in 2024.)\nDevelopers have argued that the property tax break 485x needs to be amended to encourage more housing construction. Since the incentive was enacted, developers have\nfavored projects\nwith 99 housing units or fewer, to avoid paying construction wages that kick in at 100 units, and then become higher in certain areas of the city at 150 units.\nChanging those thresholds or reducing the wages would be a major fight that would outrage New York\u2019s construction unions, something the governor would likely be loath to do in an election year. Delgado has made clear that he thinks the state\u2019s existing housing tax credit and subsidy programs do not work.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a can of worms anyone is looking to open this year,\u201d one real estate consultant said, on the condition of anonymity. \u201cIf she goes too far on the developer\u2019s side, she runs the risk of losing labor, and that is critical for her.\u201d\nKasirer said it\u2019s probably too early to tell if the legislature will pick up 485x. Lawmakers have tended to wait until such programs expire before amending them, but 485x has a longer runway than its predecessors and doesn\u2019t expire until June 2034.\nTweaks to the state\u2019s rent laws would also be a tough sell in an election year, Fontas said. Reforms to elements of the law, like the Individual Apartment Improvement and Major Capital Improvement programs, could help landlords increase rents on stabilized apartments after completing renovations.\nSome streamlining of the state\u2019s environmental review process and increased resources for housing courts may be achievable, however, Fontas added.\nBut Kenny Burgos, CEO of the New York Apartment Association, said he doesn\u2019t know how much longer the legislature can \u201cignore\u201d the deterioration of the city\u2019s rent stabilization stock. He noted that Mamdani has \u201celevated the issue of rent-stabilized housing and its overall operations to almost national proportions,\u201d through his pledge to freeze rents for stabilized housing.\nOn the bright side, Mamdani has spoken about the need to address landlord costs through\nproperty tax\nand\ninsurance\nreform.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been an acknowledgement that you cannot simply freeze the rents and expect good results to happen in this housing stock,\u201d Burgos said.\nWhether those talking points turn into action at the state level remains to be seen.\nSome in the industry fear that the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, which would\ngive tenants first dibs\non buying their building if their landlord decides to sell, will gain traction this year, especially after the city passed a version that applies to nonprofits and other entities. Eric Adams\nvetoed\nthe bill, COPA, on his final day in office.\nThe New York State Tenant Bloc, a DSA-affiliated group, formed last year to organize tenants to only vote for mayoral candidates who supported a rent freeze. This year, it is focused on expanding rent stabilization throughout the state, said spokesperson Ritti Singh. That includes pushing for a measure that would make it easier for localities outside of New York City to adopt rent stabilization.\nSingh said securing more funding for the state\u2019s housing voucher program will also be a top priority.\nShe doesn\u2019t think the fact that it\u2019s an election year will necessarily deter the governor and lawmakers from tackling controversial issues.\n\u201cWe thought in 2024, there would be no housing deal for this reason,\u201d she said, referring to the state\u2019s budget that year, which included 485x and good cause eviction, along with several other housing-related policies.\nShe pointed to Mamdani\u2019s win, and the fact that he ran on a promise to freeze rents for stabilized apartments as a key reason the governor and lawmakers can\u2019t ignore this part of the affordability agenda.\n\u201cZohran Mamdani just ran on a rent freeze,\u201d she said. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s a mandate.\u201d",

        "content": "Co-op shareholders at Carnegie House were dealt a blow by the New York County Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the parcel\u2019s landowners in a dispute over the ground lease.\nThe court upheld a rent hike for the property\u2019s ground lease, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n, affecting the payments of hundreds of shareholders that may no longer be able to keep up with payments. The rent increase, enacted by David Werner and Rubin Schron, is expected to bring the annual ground rent from $4.36 million to approximately $24 million.\n\u201cIn the middle of a housing crisis, our billionaire landowners are pulling out all the stops to push out middle-class New Yorkers for their own gain,\u201d Carnegie House board of directors President Richard Hirsch said in a statement, promising an appeal.\nFor his part, Hirsch\u2019s monthly costs could nearly triple from $5,000 to $13,000.\nA spokesperson for the landowners said they were \u201cprepared to work with permanent residents demonstrating a need for rental assistance.\u201d\nThe ground lease rent at 100 West 57th Street on Billionaires\u2019 Row expired on March 15. The lease was renewed, but the landowners and co-op did not agree on rent as a scheduled reset arrived last year.\nInitial talks positioned rent at $40 million, 10 times the existing rate. The board came back with $5.4 million and then increased the offer by $50,000, according to court filings.\nThe owners then offered $25 million; the co-op would be responsible for 75 percent of the rent (10 percent of that is paid for by proceeds from the building\u2019s garage), while the owners of the retail portion would cover 25 percent, a representative for the landowners confirmed over the\nsummer\n.\nThe board and a limited liability company that controls the building\u2019s retail space filed a lawsuit in September 2024 asking the court to temporarily halt ground lease negotiations, but the judge\ndeclined\nthat request two months later and\ndismissed\nthe case entirely in March.\nIf Carnegie House fails to make good on its ground lease, it would lose it and the building would revert to rent-stabilization status, destroying owner equity while leaving shareholders stuck with mortgage payments.\nThe dispute already put out shareholders who struggled to secure mortgages due to the uncertain forthcoming costs of living in the co-op. Unit values declined during the fight and are well below market rate for the neighborhood.\nSchron and Werner purchased the land underneath the building in 2014 for $261 million.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The 4.5-acre waterfront compound at 3585 Anchorage Way traded hands in December for $101.5 million, according to the Multiple Listing Service.\nDanny Hertzberg, Jill Hertzberg, Nathan and Judy Zeder of the Jills Zeder Group represented the seller.

        "content": "A quiet pocket of single-family homes in suburban Addison is shaping up to be the latest frontline in Chicagoland\u2019s industrial expansion wars.\nResidents of 53 Trails Estates, an unincorporated neighborhood east of Route 53 and south of Army Trail Boulevard, contend that Transwestern Development is targeting the area for a potential industrial or commercial project, the Daily Herald\nreported\n. The push sparked months of organizing, public meetings and neighbor-on-neighbor tension in a community many residents insist was never meant to be considered a teardown.\nThe neighborhood, which includes more than 90 homes, sits just outside Addison\u2019s municipal boundaries, in a village that already boasts one of the largest industrial parks in Illinois. UPS, Pampered Chef and Nabisco all have a presence nearby, making the land increasingly attractive to developers chasing logistics and flex demand along major transportation corridors.\nTranswestern\nhas not publicly detailed a proposal, and a spokesperson could not be reached for comment. But residents told the outlet that outreach by a commercial real estate firm working on the developer\u2019s behalf has made it clear that the area is being explored for\nindustrial redevelopment\n.\nAt a Dec. 15 village meeting, Addison Village Manager Joe Maranowicz said there is no formal proposal before the board, and no action is underway. Village staff told the developer that any next steps would require interest from all homeowners \u2014 a high bar in a neighborhood that is anything but unified.\n\u201cLast thing we want is a community to be divided amongst each other,\u201d Maranowicz said at the meeting, acknowledging that some residents want to sell, while others are firmly opposed.\nThe neighborhood\u2019s appeal lies precisely in what industrial development would erase: mature trees, large lots and decades-long ties among neighbors, some of the residents contend. Several residents have lived there for 30 or 40 years. Others moved in more recently, drawn by the area\u2019s mid-century homes and low-key suburban character.\nSupporters of redevelopment, however, argue that Addison can\u2019t afford to turn its back on\ngrowth\n. With industrial demand still strong and neighboring municipalities competing for employers and tax base, some residents see a partial or phased development as a reasonable compromise.\nThe dispute echoes past battles in the\nO\u2019Hare area\n, where longstanding neighborhoods like Mohawk Manor were eventually bought out and demolished for industrial projects. Those scars loom large for residents now facing similar uncertainty.\nThe standoff has for now left 53 Trails Estates in limbo. Yard signs, custom T-shirts and even Christmas lights signal opposition, while others quietly weigh offers and future possibilities.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The value of the land \u2014 2.4 acres on a branch of the coveted Colorado River \u2014 greatly outstrips the value of the 2,600-square-foot three-bedroom, three-bathroom house built in 1998.

        "content": "One of downtown Austin\u2019s most conspicuously empty office towers is no longer empty.\nGoogle finally moved into the Sail Tower, the 35-story, 804,000-square-foot skyscraper at 601 West Second Street, after leaving the building dark for years despite holding a full-building lease. The Austin Business Journal\nreported\nthat activity was visible inside the badge-restricted lobby on Tuesday morning, and a building employee confirmed that Google occupied the tower late last year, shortly before the holidays. Google executives declined to comment.\nThe move closes a long-running loop in Austin\u2019s office market. Google signed a lease for the entire Sail Tower in 2019, committing to the building through 2038. But after the tower was completed in 2022, the tech giant never moved in, turning the sail-shaped glass tower into a downtown riddle: fully leased, architecturally striking and entirely vacant.\nGoogle\nconfirmed\nin March that it planned to occupy the building by the end of 2025.\nLeaving the tower empty was hardly cheap. According to commercial real estate firm Avison Young, trophy office rents in Austin\u2019s central business district averaged $67.39 per square foot at the end of 2019. At that rate, the Austin Business Journal estimated that Google would have been paying roughly $53 million annually \u2014 or about $145,000 per day \u2014 for space it wasn\u2019t using. That burn rate, while eye-popping by local standards, is a rounding error for\nAlphabet\n, which most recently reported about $125 billion in annual net income.\nGoogle wasn\u2019t exactly homeless during the gap either. The company also leases space at East Austin\u2019s Saltillo development and occupies much of the neighboring tower at 500 West Second Street. Whether those leases will be renewed or shed now that Sail Tower is active remains unclear.\nThe building\u2019s dark years didn\u2019t scare off investors. Atlanta-based Cousins Properties\nbought\nthe Sail Tower from Dallas-based Trammell Crow Company for $521.8 million in December 2024, betting on Google\u2019s long-term commitment. At the time, Cousins executives said they were comfortable with Google\u2019s plans for Austin, even as the tower sat unused.\nDespite leasing the entire building, Google may not be alone inside for long. The company has been marketing the top six floors for sublease. One potential subtenant is\nDigital Realty Trust\n, which filed plans last year to build out an executive office suite and terrace space on the upper floors.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "An AI startup with a housing stipend is swapping Long Island City for Williamsburg\u2019s waterfront.\nVoice analytics company Rilla inked a 57,000-square-foot lease at Global Holdings\u2019\n25 Kent\nin one of the borough\u2019s biggest office deals of the past year. The AI company will occupy the entire eighth-floor penthouse, along with nearly 4,000 square feet of private outdoor space, the landlord announced.\nThe 10-year lease pushes occupancy at the eight-story building to 72 percent. The asking rent was $76 per square foot.\nNewmark\u2019s Cooper Weisman and Ryan Gessin represented Rilla in the deal. The landlord was represented in-house by Craig Panzirer and Alex Radmin, along with Newmark\u2019s Jordan Gosin, Will Grover and Drew Wiley.\nRilla will move its 160 employees from Long Island City. CEO Sebastian Jimenez made news this summer\nwhen he announced\nthe company was covering up to $1,500 per month in rent for employees who lived close to its Long Island City office (the company defines \u201cclose\u201d as within a 10-minute bike ride). Rilla follows a\n9-9-6 work schedule\n, meaning employees work 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week.\nA company representative said Jimenez will be moving to Williamsburg and employees can choose whether or not they want to relocate closer to the office to receive the rent stipend.\nThe lease marks a win for the borough, where office landlords have\nstruggled\nto fill the glut of new buildings built over the last two decades. Buildings like the Refinery at Domino and 25 Kent are attracting AI and tech tenants, though most deals so far have been small to mid-sized.\nRubenstein Partners co-developed the 500,000-square-foot project\nwith Toby Moskovits\u2019\nHeritage Equity Partners, billing it as the borough\u2019s first ground-up commercial development in more than four decades. In 2018, Eyal Ofer\u2019s firm made a preferred-equity investment of $100 million.\nThe building opened to tenants in 2019 and streetwear brand Kith signed on as an anchor tenant. Global Holdings took over management of the building in April and landed recent lease deals from e-commerce company Queen One, Five Iron Golf and Autonomous Technologies Group.\n",

        "content": "SL Green grabbed financing for its acquisition of Park Avenue Tower, but not without putting down a significant amount of money itself.\nThe office landlord scored a $480 million mortgage to finance the\n$730 million purchase\nof 65 East 55th Street in the Plaza District, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are providing the debt, according to\nCommercial Real Estate Direct\n.\nMarc Holliday\u2019s firm is expected to make a $270 million down payment to secure the loan,\u00a0 equivalent to about 36 percent of acquisition\u2019s total financing. The figure represents a significant increase on the down payment Blackstone put down when it acquired the building a decade ago.\nThe five-year loan is expected to close next week, according to a report from S&amp;P Global.\nThe 600,000-square-foot building, which is 97 percent occupied, is filled with financial firms and hedge funds as tenants. The building\u2019s largest tenant is PineBridge Investments, occupying about 75,000 square feet; other major tenants include BTIG, Raine Group and a division of Creative Artists Agency. The seller previously spent $180 million renovating the property.\nSL Green will need to convince some tenants to stay, as about a third could leave early with a termination fee, according to S&amp;P. The average gross rents are well below market rates, however, meaning tenants won\u2019t have significant incentive to abandon ship.\nHolliday has shot out of the starting gate this year. This week alone, his firm\nsold a minority stake\nin the 100 Park Avenue office building to Rockpoint at a valuation of $425 million. That followed SL Green\u2019s prior purchase of a 49 percent stake from its partner Prudential for a $360 million valuation.\nAt its investor conference last month, SL Green said it\nplans to sell $2.5 billion\nworth of property, in part to help offset higher interest rates.\nThe real estate investment trust is \u201cselling assets [and] losing [income] to fight against interest rates that are too high,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Matthew DiLiberto said at the conference.\nThe firm also intends to be busy on the buy side with roughly $1 billion worth of acquisitions planned for this year.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The last undeveloped piece of the former Pheasant Run Resort in suburban Chicago could soon get a commercial reboot \u2014 with some public help.\nA development group is proposing 12 to 15 buildings with retail, restaurants and potentially a hotel on nearly 34 acres at the former resort site at 4051 East Main Street in St. Charles, and is asking the city for $3.3 million in incentives to make the deal work. The Daily Herald\nreported\nthat the project, dubbed The Shops at Pheasant Run, would rise at the southeast corner of East Main Street and Kautz Road.\nChicago-based Vequity\nsubmitted\na concept plan for the site through an LLC dubbed SC Landman. Vequity acquired the property in April after the last remaining resort structures were demolished the year prior. The parcel represents the final chapter in the redevelopment of the once-sprawling Pheasant Run property, which has steadily been carved up since the resort shuttered.\nCity staff is reviewing the proposal, while the developers gather feedback. Once that process wraps, the group will decide whether to formally pursue the project.\nTo get there, the\ndevelopers\nare seeking $3.3 million in city assistance to offset what they describe as \u201cextraordinary development costs,\u201d including soil and environmental remediation, and to achieve a \u201creasonable rate of return,\u201d according to city documents. The site sits within the Pheasant Run tax-increment financing district, which was created with the expectation that redevelopment would require public subsidy due to the property\u2019s condition.\nThe land once held Pheasant Run\u2019s main resort buildings and hotel, which were destroyed in a\nmassive 2022 fire\nwhile the property sat vacant. Two teenagers were later placed on probation for starting the blaze.\nTwo site plans were submitted for review. Both envision a mix of service-oriented retail and dining. One version shows a gas station, hotel and urgent care facility on the east end of the site, while the other swaps in a car dealership. Either plan would introduce new driveways, shared access points and a stormwater detention area, with entrances off Kautz Road, East Main Street and Pheasant Run Drive.\nSeveral components would require zoning relief, including approval for multiple drive-through uses \u2014 a point city officials have already flagged. During a December plan commission meeting, staff also pushed for a more pedestrian-friendly layout, calling for sidewalks along storefronts, internal walkways connecting individual lots and paths around the detention area.\nCity officials\nencouraged public art, upgraded landscaping and a cohesive architectural approach across the development. Despite the critiques, the city has expressed \u201cgeneral support\u201d for the concept, according to documents.\nElsewhere on the former resort grounds, redevelopment has leaned heavily toward auto and industrial uses. Two car dealerships now occupy 21 acres, while the former golf course has been transformed into an 85-acre industrial park with three warehouses completed and a fourth underway.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

With the start of the state legislative session and the first meeting of the new City Council, things are about to get more interesting.\nAs expected, Julie Menin was elected City Council speaker during the Council\u2019s first meeting. Top of mind is whether she will move to override former Mayor Eric Adams\u2019\nvetoes\nof the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act and a trio of housing regulation bills. Menin has said the Council is considering its options.\nIn her first address as speaker, Menin said the City Council will release its own housing plan looking for opportunities to redevelop the city\u2019s libraries to also include housing (as was done with the Sunset Park library) and to build on city-owned land.\nDuring her speech, Menin also noted that the first Muslim mayor and first Jewish speaker of the Council are serving at the same time.\n\u201cThis moment truly is historic,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what will write this interfaith leadership into the history books is if it can act as an opportunity for all of us to come together \u2014 to calm tensions, to bridge divides and to recognize we are one city, no matter the religion we practice or the language we speak.\u201d\nIn Albany, the legislative session kicked off Wednesday, and in less than a week, Gov. Kathy Hochul is expected to lay out her agenda in the State of the State. Hochul is up for re-election and is going to face pressure on the left to support tax increases on the state\u2019s wealthiest, which is key to funding Mamdani\u2019s key campaign promises. She\u2019s also up against a Republican challenger likely to emphasize the need to stop the new mayor\u2019s agenda.\nIndustry folks don\u2019t seem to have a lot of\nhope\nthat changes to 485x are on the table this year. Landlord groups have previously pushed for legislation that would allow one-time rent resets on vacant stabilized apartments, though lawmakers have shown little appetite to do so. Mamdani has voiced support for property tax reform and alternative insurance models, though, as ways to address owner costs.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill Hochul include anything about property tax reform or other measures to address operating costs in rent-stabilized buildings? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nOpen New York is pushing back against the Landmarks Preservation Commission\u2019s recent designation of Beverley Square West and Ditmas Park West as historic districts. The Yimby group argues that the designations unfairly exempt the areas from the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity. The designations await review by City Planning and City Council approval.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\nChristina Cover, a public school teacher and DSA member, is considering running for Assembly District 84 in the South Bronx\n,\nCity &amp; State reports\n. Assembly member Amanda Septimo, who currently represents the district, is challenging Rep. Ritchie Torres.\n\u2014\nAs part of her State of the State priorities, which will be announced next week, Gov. Kathy Hochul will propose new restrictions on 3D-printed guns and other illegal firearms\n,\nSpectrum News reports\n.\n\u2014\nAnd in news that was not on my bingo card, President Donald Trump\nannounced\nWednesday that he plans to block institutional investors from buying up single-family homes.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$9.1 million\nat 56 Crosby Street. The Soho condo unit is 4,000 square feet. It last sold in 2010 for $4.4 million.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$237.5 million\nfor 1540 Broadway. Buyers BDT &amp; MSD Partners are\nreportedly\ninvesting $150 million in amenities packages for the 907,000-square-foot office building.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $18.5 million for 205 Clinton Street. The Cobble Hill townhouse is listed by\nCompass\u2019\nLindsay Barrett, Taylor Schultz and Christopher Mohr.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 68,813-square-foot, 13-story, mixed-use building at 7-45 Wyckoff Avenue in Ridgewood.

        "content": "DWS Group sold a two-building office complex in Coral Gables for $119.6 million, amid the firm\u2019s nationwide divestment from the asset class.\nDallas-based Lone Star Funds, Jay Caplin\u2019s Miami-based Square2 Capital and David Moret\u2019s Highline Real Estate Capital bought The Alhambra, consisting of the 14-story building at 2 Alhambra Plaza and the seven-story building at 95 Merrick Way, according to the buyers\u2019 news release. Lone Star Funds is led by Donald Quintin and John Grayken. Square2 and Highline are based in Miami.\nThe buyers obtained a $98.5 million loan from an entity tied to Rialto Capital Management. The debt consists of DWS\u2019 outstanding $58.3 million balance on its loan to a previous financier, which Rialto assumed, and an additional $40.2 million, according to records.\nThe deal comes amid a slow South Florida office market compared to the pandemic-induced boom fueled by an influx of out-of-state tenants and high valuations.\nThe 326,000-square-foot Alhambra is about 87 percent leased, the release says. The sale amounts to $367 per square foot.\nThe complex, completed in 1961 and 1987, spans a full city block. A Hyatt Regency Coral Gables Hotel sits between the two office buildings. The hotel wasn\u2019t part of the sale.\nSquare2 Management will manage the property.\nHermen Rodriguez and Mathew McCormack were part of the JLL team that represented DWS. A JLL team also secured the financing on behalf of the buyers.\nDWS, and its U.S. real estate subsidiary Rreef, have been shedding offices in recent years. It put The Alhambra on the market last summer with a target price of about\n$125 million\n.\nDWS, led by Americas CEO Hepsen Uzcan and Todd Henderson as head of real estate for the Americas, paid $118.6 million for The Alhambra in 2015, according to property records and the firm\u2019s website.\nHenderson told\nThe Real Deal\nlast summer that Rreef made a policy decision to divest from its\noffice portfolio nationwide\neven before the pandemic took a toll on occupancies.\nIn February, the firm sold two office properties in downtown Fort Lauderdale, also for minimal gains from what it paid for them. DWS sold Las Olas Centre I &amp; II, consisting of an 18-story building at 350 East Las Olas Boulevard and a 15-story building at 450 East Las Olas Boulevard, for\n$208 million\n. Chicago-based Bradford Allen Investment Advisors was the buyer. DWS paid $204 million for Las Olas Centre in 2014, records show.\nIn the same week, Rreef Property Trust sold the 23-story Bank of America Plaza at Las Olas City Centre at\u00a0 401 East Las Olas Boulevard for\n$221 million\n, also to Lone Star Funds\u2019 real estate fund VII, Highline Real Estate Capital and Square2 Capital. Rreef paid\n$220 million\nfor the property in 2016.\nNew-to-market firms are still leasing in South Florida, though fewer than the bonanza in the first three years of the pandemic. But office investment sales became scarcer amid higher interest rates and other elevated expenses such as insurance, widening bid-ask gaps and\nlowering property valuations\n.\nLandlords divesting from offices nationwide are more likely to sell in South Florida, where they can still sell for at least breakeven prices or for smaller losses than what they would record elsewhere in the U.S.,\nexperts have told TRD\n.\nAlso in Coral Gables, AEW Capital Management sold the 11-story Ryder Colonnade office building at 169 Coral Way to Fort Worth, Texas-based Crescent Real Estate for\n$70.4 million\nlast month. The deal marked a 13 percent discount from what AEW paid over a decade ago.\u00a0A tougher capital markets environment opened the door to all-cash buyers who can avoid taking out financing. In last year\u2019s top office deal, Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega paid\n$274.4 million\nin cash for the 30-story Sabadell Financial Center in Miami\u2019s Brickell.\n",

        "content": "Residents and business owners gathered Wednesday in the Pacific Palisades as they pointed the finger at local and state officials for bungling the recovery and prevention of last year\u2019s deadly\nwildfires\n.\nCalled the \u201cThey let us burn\u201d demonstration, it was held on the one-year anniversary of the\nPalisades and Eaton blazes\n, which damaged or destroyed some 16,000 residential and commercial structures across mostly Altadena, Pacific Palisades and parts of Malibu.\nWhile local and state officials have repeatedly pegged the recovery as the fastest in history, many residents and business owners are still grappling with delays in insurance claims, rising construction costs and a web of taxes and fees for rebuilding or selling off their lots. They\u2019re asking their government leaders for accountability in helping complete the recovery.\nAt least one public official was on hand to listen to speakers at the demonstration, with Los Angeles City Councilmember Traci Park taking to the podium at one point to criticize \u201cbotched evacuations\u201d and \u201cdry hydrants.\u201d\n\u201cWhat you all are asking for going forward is basic. It is reasonable and we shouldn\u2019t have to beg our government to make this right,\u201d Park, whose district includes the\nPalisades\n, told the crowd of hundreds.\nShe earned cheers when she allowed that \u201cof course, your permit fees should be waived,\u201d before criticizing speculators, saying \u201cdevelopers are circling like vultures, looking to profit by adding density.\u201d\nThe ire harbored by some could earn reality TV star Spencer Pratt, who lost his home to the Palisades Fire, some voter support as he announced his run for mayor of Los Angeles. He confirmed it while at the podium in a shock announcement that will pit \u201cThe Hills\u201d star against incumbent Mayor Karen Bass in a move that drew cheers from the crowd.\n\u201cI coped with [the fires] by eating burritos and putting every ounce of energy into uncovering the truth and the dirty facts I\u2019ve uncovered this year will completely blow you away,\u201d Pratt told the crowd. \u201cI used to think my taxpayer dollars funded a functional city and a state government whose infrastructure and essential services would be there when I needed them, but I was completely na\u00efve.\u201d\nPratt would be the latest political outsider looking to shake up city hall. His announcement follows Presbyterian minister\nRae Chen Huang\n\u2019s bid to also unseat Bass. Huang, a dues-paying member of the Democratic Socialists of America, announced her run in November. While seen as a longshot candidate, she\u2019s campaigning on a platform that includes affordable housing, free transit and addressing public safety through a boost in mental health services.\nOn repeat\nWhile many of the speakers focused on what went wrong a year ago, organizers of the demonstration also outlined 10 key moves seen as necessary for future prevention and shepherding a fast-tracked recovery.\nSome of the imperatives outlined overlap with calls residential agents and brokers made in the weeks after the fires were tamed\nlast year\n, including a stop on permit fees and temporary moratorium on the Measure United to House L.A. levy, or so-called mansion tax, in the city of Los Angeles. The rally organizers are calling for a five-year \u201cULA holiday\u201d on property sales that would normally be hit by the transfer tax, while those who penned the\nagent letter\nasked for an exemption for sellers impacted by the fires.\nThat initial call to action was led by the Oppenheim Group\u2019s Jason Oppenheim and The Agency\u2019s Ben Belack in a letter to Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California CEO Aaron Kirman, who was at the rally, was one of more than 45 agents and brokers who signed last year\u2019s letter.\n\u201cOne year later, the real failure isn\u2019t debris removal, it\u2019s rebuilding,\u201d Kirman said Wednesday. \u201cLeaders treated this like a press problem instead of a housing market crisis. That\u2019s why the five-year ULA holiday and eliminating taxes on rebuilds resonated so strongly. They confront the very policies slowing recovery.\u201d\nThe ULA tax, which has been a sore spot for residential and commercial real estate since going into effect in the spring of 2023, assesses a 4 percent tax on deals starting at $5.3 million and 5.5 percent on those of $10.6 million or more. Voters passed the tax as a 2022 ballot measure.\nIn October, Bass asked the city council to approve an ordinance giving the finance director power to grant a one-time exemption from Measure ULA to residential property owners impacted by the fires. That was followed up in November with the Ad Hoc Committee for LA Recovery\nrequesting a report\nin 30 days on the feasibility of such a carveout.\nSimilar consideration on the matter of permit fees is also winding its way through city hall.\nNourmand &amp; Associates\u2019 Rochelle Atlas Maize, a Beverly Hills-based agent who was also at the demonstration, said full suspension of permit fees is the demand she backs the most.\n\u201cThese homeowners aren\u2019t upgrading or speculating,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are replacing what was lost. Every added fee delays recovery, increases underinsurance risk and pushes families out permanently.\u201d\nLike Kirman, she also supports the temporary ULA suspension and offered that in an ideal situation, the tax would be permanently waived in any instance of disaster recovery.\nAtlas Maize has several clients that are \u201cfrozen\u201d from moving forward, whether that\u2019s due to insurance proceeds not covering construction costs, permit fees or other factors.\n\u201cThese are not isolated cases,\u201d she said. \u201cThey reflect a systemic problem where recovery costs are being shifted onto individual homeowners instead of shared as a public responsibility.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Dalian Wanda Group\u2019s bulk sale of St. Regis Chicago condos in December was the result of a dispute with Sony over the rights to the popular \u201cOctonauts\u201d children\u2019s show.\nWhen the Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group\ntransferred a group of condos valued at $47.5\nmillion in December,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported the buyer was CPE Stage Investments. But property records with more details on the purchasing company weren\u2019t available at the time.\nA recent Cook County deed shows the buyer is connected to Sony Pictures Entertainment, the U.S. media arm of the Tokyo-based media and electronics conglomerate. The deed also shows the sale included 16 of the\n37 condos Wanda owned\nat the building.\nThe transfer of the units at the 101-story, Jeanne Gang-designed skyscraper at 363 East Wacker Drive is the conclusion of a long-running legal fight which spilled into a United Kingdom court in 2024.\nIn 2017, Wanda\u2019s children\u2019s entertainment subsidiary purchased a 51 percent stake in Vampire Squid Productions, the holding company for the animated show \u201cOctonauts,\u201d from Silvergate, according to a Variety report from 2024.\nThe agreement stipulated the remaining share of Vampire Squid was subject to an option for Wanda to purchase at a later date, the publication reported. When Sony bought Silvergate in 2019, Sony exercised the option and valued the remaining 49 percent at $87.4 million.\nAfter disputes over the price, Sony sued Wanda in 2024, accusing it of neglecting its end of the deal. Last year, a UK judge ordered Wanda to pay Sony $49 million for the remaining 49 percent stake in the \u201cOctonauts\u201d property, ICLG News reported.\nRather than paying cash, Wanda agreed to a non-cash asset swap with Sony, according to a filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Wanda acquired the remaining 49 percent stake in Vampire Squid Productions while Sony\u2019s subsidiary took over the 16 residential units at the St. Regis.\nThe asset swap gives Wanda full rights to the \u201cOctonauts\u201d intellectual property globally until 2034 and in China until 2053, according to the filing.\nIt\u2019s unclear what Sony will do with the units. Downtown\nChicago condos have been a tough sell\nin recent years, but the St. Regis, which was completed in 2020, notched some of the highest prices downtown in 2025. The bulk price for Sony\u2019s acquisition comes out to an average of nearly $3 million per unit, but it includes an 89th floor unit likely worth much more.\nThat 6,000-square-foot condo never sold individually but was listed in 2019 for $11 million. It was taken off the for-sale market in 2020 but was listed for rent at $35,000 per month for much of 2025; it\u2019s unclear if it was ever leased but the rental listing was most recently removed from the market in November.\nSony Pictures Entertainment and Wanda Group did not respond to requests for comment.\nWang Jianlin\u2019s Wanda has had a long history at the St. Regis. The firm originally invested in the 101-story project in 2016 alongside Chicago-based Magellan Development Group, intending to debut its first U.S. hotel under the Wanda Vista brand. But after Chinese regulations on overseas investment tightened, Wanda sold its 90 percent stake to Magellan for $270 million in 2020.\nIn March, Wanda marketed the 37 condos it owned in the building as a bulk sale. The condos handed over to Sony came from that pool, property records show.\nIn 2024, Magellan sold its remaining 84 units to Denver-based GD Holdings for $117 million. GD holdings has been able to command high prices for the prime units in that portfolio: A 79th-floor penthouse sold for\n$7.5 million in September\n. In October, Siri co-founder\nDag Kittlaus\nbought an 84th-floor St. Regis penthouse for $9.25 million, property records show.\nThe priciest sale on record at the St. Regis came in 2022, when\nMexican mining executive German Larrea\npurchased a two-story, 10,000-square-foot penthouse spanning the 71st and 72nd floors for $20 million.\n",

The mill was formerly a 50-50 venture between U.S. Steel Corporation and South Korea-based steel company Posco. In 2020, U.S. Steel Corporation bought Posco\u2019s 50 percent share, placing ownership under U.S. Steel itself. The $275 million internal transfer moves ownership from U.S. Steel Corporation to U.S. Steel Property Holdings.\nThe property spans 11 parcels at addresses on Loveridge Road, East Third Street, Columbia Street, and Antioch-Pittsburg Highway in\nPittsburg\n. U.S. Steel Property Holdings acquired the site through a quitclaim deed, which transfers property ownership from a grantor to a grantee without any warranties or guarantees.\nIn December 2023, U.S. Steel indefinitely paused production at the plant in Pittsburg, halting all manufacturing of cold-rolled sheets, galvanized sheets, tinplate and tin-free steel. The shutdown coincided with the announcement that Japan-based Nippon Steel would be acquiring the company; in total, 474 workers at the plant lost their jobs. At the time operations were suspended, the factory was the West Coast\u2019s only producer of tin plates for the canning industry, as well as other products. Nippon Steel\u2019s purchase was completed last June.\nNippon Steel\u2019s purchase has appeared to revitalize some of the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based firm\u2019s growth efforts. Since Nippon Steel officially took ownership, U.S. Steel has announced plans for a large renovation at an Alabama plant, restarting a blast furnace at an Illinois plant and a revamp of a blast furnace at an Indiana plant.\nU.S. Steel\u2019s plans for the Pittsburg, California, plant are not immediately clear.\nThe East Bay in particular has become the manufacturing and industrial hub of the Bay Area, attracting investors from near and far.\nIn July BKM Capital Partners and Kayne Anderson Real Estate, through their industrial-focused joint venture,\npurchased a 16-building industrial portfolio\nin Concord and Hayward from a Blackstone affiliate for more than $120 million. In November, BKM and Kayne Anderson also bought a four-building, 105,101-square-foot industrial campus in Pleasant Hill for $25 million.

The Houston Business Journal\nreported\nthat in the role, he\u2019ll oversee the brokerage\u2019s local advisory business, which includes more than 250 employees, about 60 brokers and a property management portfolio spanning roughly 34 million square feet.\nOverall will also lead recruiting efforts in Houston, reporting to Chris Hipps, Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s executive regional director for\nTexas\n.\nThe move puts a deeply entrenched owner-side executive at the controls of one of the city\u2019s largest brokerage firms. At Brookfield Properties, Overall ran all aspects of the firm\u2019s Texas operations, from leasing and property management to development, construction and accounting.\nBrookfield ranks as Houston\u2019s third-largest commercial real estate owner, with about 10 million square feet locally across offices, retail, multifamily projects and hotels.\nBefore\njoining\nBrookfield in 2017, Overall spent 19 years at Hines, where he worked on the acquisition, disposition, development and management of more than $2 billion worth of Class A commercial real estate, according to the release.

        "content": "Sometimes, winning a housing lottery isn\u2019t what it\u2019s cracked up to be.\nA Newsday newsletter on Tuesday caught my attention with this headline: \u201cA lottery could help some Long Islanders buy a condo for less than $300G.\u201d\nThe story said 16 two-story townhomes in the Beechwood Organization\u2019s 152-home Yaphank development can be purchased at a discount by buyers who meet income guidelines and are selected in the random drawing.\nI immediately thought back to a November story in Newsday about a condo lottery in Westhampton Beach. Winners would pay $535,875 for seven of the 45 homes in an Inland Real Estate Capital development where the listed prices were $1.4 million to $1.8 million.\nQuite a deal, right?\nHowever, of 136 lottery applicants,\nonly two were eligible\n. The earnings limit was 130 percent of the area median income, but some applicants didn\u2019t account for common charges, insurance premiums and other ownership expenses (the kind that tenants typically take for granted).\nYaphank isn\u2019t glamorous like Westhampton Beach, and the discounts for Beechwood\u2019s workforce homes don\u2019t sound as sexy either.\nSeven homes will be sold for $75,000 less than their $371,875 sticker price, a 20 percent discount. Another seven are just $25,000 off their regular price of $445,250, a savings of just 5.6 percent. The two income tiers are 80 percent and 120 percent of the area median income. (Two of the 16 workforce units will be built later and haven\u2019t been priced yet.)\nNewsday graciously put a puffy, e-mailed quote from Beechwood principal Steven Dubb high up in the article. \u201cOffering below market-rate homes through the lottery system helps us to help first-time new home owners, many who are essential workers, to establish themselves and stay on Long Island for years to come.\u201d\nAbsolutely true. But, reality check: This was a business strategy, not an act of pure altruism.\nAs the story later noted, Beechwood discounted 10 percent of the development\u2019s homes in return for being allowed to build at a higher density than the site\u2019s zoning.\nThis was possible under the Long Island Workforce Housing Act, passed in 2008. It applies to Nassau and Suffolk counties and defines \u201cworkforce\u201d housing as affordable to households earning up to 130 percent of the area median income. Developers can build the workforce units off-site, or not build them at all and pay into a workforce housing fund instead.\nA 2014\naudit\nof 29 developments built under the act flagged several for failing to meet its terms. The developer of a 32-unit project in the Town of Islip forgot to set aside any workforce units \u2014 and town officials forgot to check. The villages of Hempstead and Mineola approved three projects without the required workforce units.\nOne takeaway is that achieving affordability by regulation is possible but far from perfect. The Westhampton Beach lottery where only two applicants were eligible to buy\n$1.8 million homes\ndiscounted 70 percent might be an extreme example, but it shows the difficulty of this process.\nIn other cases, trust fund kids \u2014 just out of college but not earning much money yet \u2014 qualify to buy into affordable co-ops intended for working-class New Yorkers. Bloomberg blew the rich kids\u2019 cover with an\ninvestigative story\nin 2021, but gaming the system is still possible.\nAt one income-restricted co-op in East Harlem, where units are supposed to be owner-occupied, one woman\nacquired seven apartments\nand didn\u2019t live in any of them.\nNew York City in 2017\nmandated affordability\nin rezoned areas, but the law works much better in some neighborhoods (such as\nGowanus\n) than others (\nEast New York\n). A citywide law cannot account for the city\u2019s vastly different individual markets.\nThe quest to regulate affordability in high-demand metro areas such as New York and Los Angeles is enormously complex, inherently flawed and will never end. Meanwhile,\nsome cities\nhave achieved affordability without ever requiring it.\n",

The buyer is New York-based Nuveen Global Investments, deed records show.\nAfter buying the property in 2007, San Antonio Alternative Housing Corporation partnered with the Austin Housing Finance Corporation \u2014 crucially, the property it purchased is in Austin, the same municipality as the corporation \u2014 to issue $10.8 million in bonds to rehab the property.\nThe former owner got tax breaks in exchange for keeping rents affordable. Those credits were transferred to Nuveen.\nThe 252-unit apartment complex was built in 1972. Terms of the deal weren\u2019t disclosed, but the property was last valued at $26.4 million by the local appraisal district, which works out to $104,642 per unit.\nTax benefits conferred by Texas housing finance corporations came under fire after reporting showed that apartment owners were partnering with affordable housing entities in far-flung counties to wipe their properties off of local tax rolls.\nLawmakers\nresponded\nwith a crackdown on these so-called \u201ctraveling\u201d tax credits via House Bill 21, which passed in the summer of 2025. Affordable housing developers and advocates say\nit goes too far\nin its creation of new affordability requirements.\nInvestors\u2019 discontent inspired a\nlawsuit\nagainst the new legislation, which has further divided Texas\u2019 affordable housing development community. Some critics of the law\naren\u2019t on board with the lawsuit\n, since it was filed by an investor that used the maligned loophole. The suit, filed in September in Cameron County, remains pending.\nThe fallout of HB 21\u2019s passage is still ongoing. Some appraisal districts have taken the law as justification for denying property tax breaks for entities that used the loophole \u2014 even though the law appears to give them several years to come into compliance with new requirements.\n",

        "content": "A proposal for Surfside\u2019s first Live Local Act project with an 11-story building in an area capped at four floors has riled the coastal municipality.\nTwo developers want to build Ocean Walk Residences &amp; Hotel with 33 residential and hotel units on the 0.3-acre site at 250 95th Street, according to an application filed in November. The applicants are an affiliate of the site owner, New York-based Postal Realty Trust led by Andrew Spodek, and an entity called Ocean Walk Surfside LLC, registered to an attorney in downtown Miami.\nThe site, now home to an 8,000-square-foot post office, is on the west side of Collins Avenue.\nDesigned by Plus architecture firm, the building would consist of 13 four-bedroom units, seven efficiencies, two one-bedroom units and 11 hotel rooms. It will have a rooftop deck.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a disaster,\u201d Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said of the Live Local Act. \u201cI think the Florida politicians that decided to destroy the fabric and composition of small towns by this developer-driven initiative is outrageous.\u201d\nUnder the Live Local Act, developers can build bigger projects than a site\u2019s zoning permits if they designate 40 percent of units for households earning no more than 120 percent of the area median income. The below-market units have to be for rent and remain income-restricted for at least 30 years. Developers also can bypass public hearings to obtain approvals administratively.\nThe proposal doesn\u2019t specify how many units would be affordable.\nAcross South Florida, developers have seized on the law with a flurry of projects, but proposals for some small coastal Miami-Dade towns have touched off a firestorm.\nIn barrier islands such as Surfside, Bay Harbor Islands and Bal Harbour, \u201cthe Live Local Act does not give enough weight to the traffic impacts,\u201d said Surfside resident Michael Karukin. \u201cIt also does not give enough weight to what many comprehensive plans refer to as capacity in infrastructure.\u201d\nAside from concerns over additional strain on already congested roads, Ocean Walk opponents cited potential issues with crowded schools, and an erosion of the town\u2019s right to determine its own growth and development fate and preserve its small-town feel.\n\u201cIt takes me about 15 minutes to go 1 mile,\u201d said Surfside resident Robert Lisman. \u201cSurfside was designed to be a small family town, not like Sunny Isles Beach or Miami Beach.\u201d\nAlso a thorn for opponents: The developers propose underground parking, which the town banned in 2024, except for sites on the east side of Collins Avenue, according to the developers\u2019 letter of intent. But in the letter, they invoke\nSenate Bill 180\n, state law passed last year that prohibited local governments from enacting \u201cmore burdensome\u201d development regulations. The law was passed in the aftermath of several hurricanes as a way to remove roadblocks to reconstruction efforts.\nSurfside\u2019s underground parking prohibition \u201cdirectly impedes the redevelopment of the property,\u201d the developers\u2019 attorney, Graham Penn, wrote in the letter. The ordinance \u201cis therefore unenforceable and the applicant will be employing underground parking in the development.\u201d\nOpponents argue that Live Local only applies for sites zoned as commercial, industrial and mixed-use. The Ocean Walk development site\u2019s zoning doesn\u2019t fit under the state law, said Karukin, a former Surfside commissioner. Because of this, the proposal \u201cshould be rejected outright,\u201d he added.\nPenn, Postal Realty and Oren Lieber, the attorney listed as manager of Ocean Walk Surfside, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. It\u2019s unknown whether Postal Realty will partner on the project or sell the site to Ocean Walk Surfside.\nFabi\u00e1n Basabe, a state representative whose district includes much of coastal Miami-Dade, argued that Live Local isn\u2019t a \u201crubber stamp\u201d for projects. The law and Senate Bill 180 are meant to address the need for affordable housing, \u201cwhile intentionally preserving local authority\u201d and giving cities \u201cmeaningful tools\u201d to review and implement projects.\nTown staff members are working on the initial review of the application and will then proceed to more technical reviews, Mario Diaz, acting town manager said in a statement.\nAs for the developers\u2019 invocation of Senate Bill 180 regarding the underground parking ban, \u201cthe town views these positions as legal arguments\u201d and not \u201csettled conclusions,\u201d Diaz said.\nIn Bal Harbour, Surfside\u2019s neighbor to the north, Whitman Family Development\u2019s proposal for a Live Local Act project at its luxury Bal Harbour Shops led to an uproar. The project would add\n275-foot buildings\nwith 600 units, a 70-key hotel and 46,000 square feet of retail. Bal Harbour and Whitman have been locked in\nlitigation\nover the project.\nWhile opponents to Live Local projects tend to agree with its concept to incentivize development of below-market rentals, they take issue with its broad inclusion of all localities across the state, regardless of their own quirks.\n\u201cIt would be like putting up a 50-story affordable housing building on Fisher Island,\u201d Burkett said, referring to the exclusive residential island. \u201cWould that be a good idea, too?\u201d\n",

        "content": "A leading Keller Williams Realty team based in Austin is forming its own brokerage, aiming to claim ground ceded by a merging industry.\nBroker Kasey Jorgenson left Keller Williams to found Jorgenson Real Estate, ending a 16-year career at Austin-based Keller Williams, the largest franchise in the industry by agent count, according to a press release.\nThe Austin Business Journal ranked the Jorgenson Group second in the city from 2019 to 2023. The group totaled $75 million in sales over about 190 transactions in 2025, according to the release.\nAs the brokerage industry\ncoagulates\n, Jorgenson expects industry titans to gradually leave physical offices, presenting an opportunity for independent teams.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how these huge companies that have brick-and-mortar and local support staff \u2014 I don\u2019t see how they can afford to give the agents the value that they should be getting now. Not many Keller Williams market centers are hugely profitable,\u201d Jorgenson said.\nJorgenson Real Estate emerges amid a difficult market for the Austin area. Austin has lost more home value than any other major metropolitan area since its last market peak in 2022, with the median home price dropping to about $490,000 in 2025 from over $575,000 in 2022, according to Zillow. The decline reflects the wane of Austin\u2019s dalliance with the tech industry.\nWhile the Austin market may appear nominally\nbalanced\n, it has a vast, unrepresented share of homeowners who want to sell, but have failed, Jorgenson said.\n\u201cAt multiple points last year, about half of the properties that were active on the market were vacant. And that wasn\u2019t counting new construction,\u201d Jorgenson said. \u201cWe consider them as people that, quote-unquote, have to sell.\u201d\nAdditionally, while Austin\u2019s home inventory only occasionally\nlapped above six months supply last year\n\u2014 the traditional threshold of a buyer\u2019s market \u2014 it had been operating below four months supply\nsince the end of the Great Recession\n.\nA significant number of sellers have decided to rent out their homes instead\n, resulting in a \u201chuge behind-the-scenes\u201d inventory of homes that will return to the market in 2026, Jorgenson believes.\n\u201cWe opened up a property management side because we were tired of sending those people elsewhere. [Renters] saturated the\ncondo market, especially\n,\u201d Jorgensen said.\n",

        "content": "A bankruptcy judge has rejected\nthe city\u2019s bid\nto pause the auction of more than 5,000 mostly rent-stabilized New York apartments, clearing the way for a possible takeover by Summit Properties.\nThe apartments were put up for sale as part of a bankruptcy suit connected to Joel Wiener\u2019s Pinnacle Group. The judge\u2019s decision represents not only a likely change in ownership in New York\u2019s multifamily market but a reminder of the limits to city power when it comes to the dealings of private companies.\nThe Mamdani administration earlier this week had asked for a 30-day pause on the sale to evaluate the transfer to Summit and explore potential alternatives. That followed similar requests from a coalition that included tenants, elected officials and the housing department under Mayor Eric Adams to delay the sale, originally with the hope that a nonprofit or other entity might be able to draw up a workable bid. Mayor Zohran Mamdani had taken things further, publicly championing the cause and vowing to intervene for tenants.\nSummit has a national portfolio of regional malls, office buildings and New York City apartments. Last summer, the company partnered with Savanna to acquire the leasehold at 444 Madison Avenue for $50 million. It offered $451 million for the Pinnacle portfolio as the minimum, or stalking horse, bidder in the auction.\nBut the Mamdani administration\nexpressed concern\nthat Summit wouldn\u2019t be able to make the acquisition work while repairing the properties with the proposed $451 million sale price. The legal rents on the units are low enough that the company likely couldn\u2019t maintain an income stream to profitably support renovations and debt service, the city said in a court filing.\nPinnacle\u2019s collection of bankrupt LLCs owes the city more than $12.7 million in unpaid fees and violations, according to court documents. They owe Flagstar Bank more than $564 million, according to court documents.\nThe sale is scheduled for Thursday. The mayor\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nKathryn Brenzel contributed reporting to this story.\n",

But the Council argued for a 4.55 percent citywide vacancy rate.\nNoble said the Common Council\u2019s resolution, which cites the 4.55 percent vacancy rate determined by an independent consultant hired by the city\u2019s Office of Housing Initiatives, \u201cmisconstrues aspects of the 2025 vacancy study and contains several factual errors.\u201d Notably, the city\u2019s report did not calculate a city-wide vacancy rate and the consultant only analyzed nine properties for its study.\nThe rent stabilization road in Kingston, which became the first upstate municipality to adopt the tenant protection measure in New York, has been controversial.\nLast August, the state\u2019s Court of Appeals\nrejected\na challenge from the Hudson Valley Property Owners Association, which argued the city\u2019s 2022 vacancy study was flawed and that its Rent Guidelines Board overreached by ordering a 15 percent rent rollback in stabilized buildings, allowing the reduction to stand and opening the door for tenants to seek refunds.\nKingston\u2019s ETPA initially covered 64 buildings and 1,200 apartments, though exemptions and rehab projects cut that total to fewer than 1,000 units, under 20 percent of the city\u2019s rentals.\nCouncil members can adjust which buildings qualify \u2014 for instance, covering only those with 22-plus units, a measure Noble supports \u2014 but can\u2019t expand eligibility beyond ETPA\u2019s pre-1974, six-unit minimum.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "After completing a condo buyout earlier this year, Kolter Group and Perko Development Partners are launching sales for a waterfront condo in West Palm Beach.\nTheir Maison d\u2019Or project is slated for the 1.4-acre waterfront site at 3705 South Flagler Drive, across the Intracoastal Waterway from President Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club. It is set to span 19 stories and 39 units, according to a news release. The design team for the project includes global architecture firm 10 Design, interiors firm Hirsch Bedner Associates and landscapes by EDSA, the release shows.\nMaison d\u2019Or will have units spanning between two and four bedrooms, and ranging in size from 3,000 square feet to more than 10,000 square feet. Amenities in the building will include a pool, spa facilities, a fitness center, a club lounge,\na private dining room\n, a theater,\nguest suites\nand a salon, the release shows.\nPrices start at $5.7 million, and the developers tapped Dan Riordan, Nick Peterson and Andreea Fodor to lead sales.\nThe developers completed a buyout of the former Flagler House, a 1985-built condominium at 3705 South Flagler Drive, in June for\n$37.6 million\n.\nHomebuilder Kolter is based in Delray Beach and led by CEO Bobby Julien. Jupiter-based Perko, headed by Phil Perko, specializes in condo buyouts and redevelopment. The firms also have a project planned in Tequesta, where they\ndropped $25 million\non a condo buyout in December and are planning an eight-story, 12-unit condo development.\nBuyouts are the name of the game in Palm Beach County, where waterfront vacant dev sites are almost non-existent. Competition for buying out aging condos on prime strips like West Palm Beach\u2019s Flagler Drive is\nhot and dirty\n. Related Ross and Fort Partners took their fight over one condo to the courts last year. Fort, led by Nadim Ashi, ultimately won control of the waterfront site at 3915 South Flagler Drive. Plans for future development haven\u2019t been disclosed.\nKolter and Perko\u2019s Maison d\u2019Or joins\na stacked pipeline of luxury condo projects\nin West Palm Beach, where more than 2,000 units are in development.",

        "content": "Chicago-based Riverside Investment &amp; Development lined up debt and equity to push forward a major office project in Charlotte\u2019s South End, locking in $245 million of construction financing for a 43-story tower at 1111 South Tryon Street.\nAffiliates of New York-based Apollo provided the construction loan for the second phase of Riverside\u2019s Queensbridge Collective project, according to Commercial Observer, which first\nreported\nthe financing. The 397,000-square-foot office tower is slated to be completed in 2028 and will rise next to a 304-unit multifamily building at 111 East Carson Boulevard.\nRiverside paired the debt with $105 million of structured equity from a joint venture involving RXR, One Investment Management and Liberty Mutual Investments, bringing the total capital committed for the phase to $350 million.\nThe financing comes with meaningful\npreleasing\nin hand. In September, Riverside announced that Charlotte-based law firm Moore &amp; Van Allen signed a 15-year lease for 206,000 square feet, more than half of the future office building, the Charlotte Business Journal\nreported\n. Insurance giant Pacific Life has also committed to 68,000 square feet, giving the project early momentum at a time when new office starts remain scarce nationwide.\nThe office tower is part of a larger, multi-tower redevelopment that Riverside has been assembling for years. The firm closed on the 1111 South Tryon site in 2021, which spans multiple parcels and currently houses fixtures like Midnight Diner and Uptown Cabaret. At the time, Riverside said construction on a mixed-use project featuring office, residential, retail and potentially a hotel would begin within a year.\nAltogether, the three-tower Queensbridge Collective is expected to carry total construction costs of up to $750 million, making it one of the more ambitious mixed-use projects in Charlotte\u2019s\nSouth End\ncorridor. South End, anchored by the LYNX Blue Line light rail and a steady influx of apartments and retail, has emerged as an\nactive submarket\nin the city for mixed-use development.\nNearby, Charlotte-based Panorama is adding to the momentum. The firm broke ground last year on The J, an 84-unit residential project at 1718\nSouth Tryon Street\n, with vertical construction now underway.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A long-vacant office building near the former Allstate headquarters campus could soon give way to wedding receptions and corporate galas.\nKehoe Designs President Tom Kehoe is planning to demolish a 106,167-square-foot office building at 2100 Sanders Road in Glenview and replace it with a two-story, 45,000-square-foot event venue, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The project would mark a second outpost of the Geraghty, the Pilsen-based venue Kehoe has owned and operated since 2015.\nThe proposal points to a creative redevelopment option for suburban office corridors littered with obsolete buildings that have struggled to attract tenants in the wake of remote work. Glenview has already leaned into that reality, most notably at the former\nAllstate campus\n, which has been remade into a\nsprawling industrial park\nafter the insurance giant decamped.\nKehoe told the outlet that he\u2019s spent years scouting the North Shore for a site to serve clients who have been pushing him to open closer to home. The 5-acre Sanders Road parcel, which borders the Cook County Forest Preserve, checked the right boxes, including ample green space for a venue with both indoor and outdoor components.\nThe existing office building, constructed in 1987 and formerly occupied by IMC Global, is owned by a venture tied to local investor Richard Colburn. Kehoe declined to disclose the purchase price, and the seller declined to comment.\nPending village approvals, Kehoe aims to close on the property and begin demolition this spring, with an eye toward opening the new venue \u2014 dubbed the Geraghty North \u2014 in spring 2027. Plans call for a maximum capacity of 600 guests and a design geared toward social and corporate events, according to a letter sent to neighbors, according to the publication. Kehoe is scheduled to present the project to nearby residents at a meeting hosted by the Glenview Park District, with a formal appearance before the village\u2019s development commission expected later this month.\nThe site sits across from\nCaremark Towers\n, another aging office complex whose owner is pursuing an industrial redevelopment.\nThe hospitality angle is also notable, as full-service hotels nearby once relied heavily on corporate events tied to Allstate\u2019s campus, but that demand cratered after the pandemic. The Hilton Chicago Northbrook, just over a mile away, defaulted on its mortgage after Allstate announced its exit, while the\nCrowne Plaza\nacross the street was hit with a foreclosure lawsuit last year.\nKehoe told the outlet that he sees an opening precisely because nearby options are limited, pointing to strong demand for outdoor-friendly venues.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Steve Croman is facing yet another foreclosure \u2014 and from a familiar foe.\nDalan Real Estate filed separate lawsuits against the\ninfamous\nlandlord over alleged loan defaults tied to seven rental properties in Manhattan, according to court documents. Croman is accused of defaulting on loans totaling roughly $39 million.\nCroman allegedly stopped making payments on the loans a year ago, according to the court filings. One loan is a $4.6 million mortgage tied to 44 Avenue B \u2014 where Croman allegedly owes $4.2 million \u2014 while the other is a $34.2 million mortgage collateralized by a handful of properties: 1345 Amsterdam Avenue, 277 East 10th Street, 279 East 10th Street, 321 West 16th Street, 521 East 5th Street and 52 Barrow Street. Croman allegedly owes $25.1 million on that debt.\nDalan is seeking to foreclose on the properties and have them auctioned. Dalan and Croman did not immediately respond to requests for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe two parties know each other well.\nLast month, Croman began\nbattling\na UCC sale on his $53 million Upper East Side home, initiated by Dalan. Croman argues the auction is not commercially reasonable, though he allegedly defaulted on a $31 million loan.\nEarlier last year, Dalan\nmoved to foreclose\non four of Croman\u2019s properties that have debt totaling $27.5 million; Dalan purchased a\n$140 million portfolio\nof the landlord\u2019s loans from Axos Bank in October 2024.\nIt\u2019s another headache for Croman, whose lenders are together trying to foreclose on more than $231 million in loan principal. Croman is also in the midst of a\nfight with his father,\nEdward Croman, who is trying to dissolve the family partnerships, alleging mismanagement.\nCroman the younger is one of the only New York landlords to have been sent to prison for real estate-related crimes. Once named one of the city\u2019s worst landlords, Croman served eight months in state prison related to mortgage and tax fraud and paid $8 million in restitution related to accusations of tenant harassment.\n",

Only a few hotels are beating that trend, such as the oceanfront Surfrider in Malibu. Luxury fashion brand Chrome Hearts, owned by Richard and Laurie Stark,\npurchased\nthe small Malibu hotel for $37.5 million from Dauntless Capital Partners. It was the priciest per-key deal of 2025 at about $1.9 million a room, and one of California\u2019s priciest per-key deals ever.\nCapital Insight owns other hotels and motels throughout Southern California, in Anaheim, Thousand Oaks and Los Angeles, according to its website. That includes the shuttered Four Points by Sheraton, near Los Angeles International Airport, which Capital Insight intends to convert to\naffordable housing\n.\nCapital Insight\u2019s proposal for the former hotel \u2014 three interconnected, mid-century buildings with more than 560 rooms \u2014 is to turn it into 572 one-bedroom apartments. Of those, 229 units would be reserved for renters earning up to 80 percent of the area median income.\nBeyond the hotel world, Blackstone, early last year,\nacquired 93 shopping centers\nacross the West Coast, including eight in Southern California when it acquired the Retail Opportunity Investment Corporation for $4 billion.\n",

        "content": "Gov. Gavin Newsom\nis allocating more than $100 million in state funds to build affordable homes for victims of the Palisades and Eaton fires.\nOn Tuesday, the day before Los Angeles marked the one-year anniversary of the deadly wildfires, Newsom announced that $107.3 million in state money will be set aside to create 665 affordable rental units that will be offered first to those affected or displaced by the fires, according to Westside Current\nreporting\nand\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s calculations.\nThe money comes from a\nMultifamily Finance Super NOFA\n, or notice of funding of application, issued by the California Department of Housing and Community Development last February. A separate statewide Multifamily Finance Super NOFA announced in September provided nearly $56.9 million for four other developments with 301 affordable rental residences in fire-impacted areas across Los Angeles County. The September NOFA allowed developers in local jurisdictions to request funding from multiple state housing programs through a single application, in turn expediting the development of new homes.\nThe funding from the February NOFA will support the construction of nine multifamily projects across Los Angeles County. On the Westside, they include the 80-unit Tierra Apartments in Santa Monica, the 40-unit U.S. Vets-WLAVA building at the\nWest Los Angeles VA campus\nand the 176-unit Crenshaw Crossing development next to the Expo/Crenshaw Metro station. On the east side, the funding will support the 43-unit La Guadalupe project in Boyle Heights as well as the 100-unit Ramona housing project for seniors in Pasadena and 44-unit Colorado Crest Apartments, also in\nPasadena\n.\nElsewhere in L.A. County, a 50-unit complex at 15804 Lakewood Boulevard in Bellflower, a 59-unit senior apartment complex at 233 North Second Avenue in Covina and the 73-unit Mercy Claremont project in Claremont will also get construction financial aid from the NOFA.\nThe developments benefiting from the new NOFA aren\u2019t in burn scar areas and will not replace destroyed homes. Newsom emphasized that the state is \u201crebuilding stronger, fairer communities in Los Angeles without displacing the people who call these neighborhoods home.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The Agency, the celebrity-fueled residential brokerage led by Netflix star Mauricio Umansky, is officially operating in Houston.\nThe Los Angeles-based firm brought on Sugar Land\u2019s The Sansone Group, which until this month operated under the Re/Max Fine Properties banner,\naccording\nto the Houston Business Journal. The new Agency office opened Tuesday at 14140 Southwest Freeway, marking the brokerage\u2019s first office in the Houston market.\nUmansky\n, best known for starring in Netflix\u2019s \u201cBuying Beverly Hills\u201d and his ties to Bravo\u2019s \u201cReal Housewives of Beverly Hills\u201d universe, founded The Agency in 2011. Since then, he\u2019s built the firm into a global luxury brand with more than 150 offices across 14 countries. Expansion has been brisk: The Agency\nlaunched\n27 offices in 2025 alone, according to the outlet, with more in the pipeline.\nHouston has long been on the company\u2019s shortlist. The Agency already operates in other major Texas metros, including Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, and Umansky has pitched the state as a market with durable fundamentals and room for long-term growth, he told the publication.\nThe Sansone Group is led by Chris and Lizz Sansone, who founded the team in 2000 and have spent 24 years under the Re/Max umbrella. Their nine-agent operation ranked No. 10 among small residential teams in the publication\u2019s 2025 Residential Real Estate Awards, logging $78.2 million in sales across the Greater Houston area.\nThe pairing began with a chance meeting at a Houston Association of Realtors event and evolved into a franchise deal that gives the Sansones ownership of the first Agency outpost in Houston. Lizz Sansone described the move as a \u201clegacy\u201d play after decades with the same brokerage, citing alignment around culture, service and branding.\nThe Agency\u2019s arrival adds to a growing cast of personality-driven brokerages in Houston. White House Global Properties Chairman Washington Ho, star of HBO Max\u2019s \u201cHouse of Ho,\u201d already\nclaims a slice\nof the city\u2019s reality TV\u2013meets\u2013real estate overlap.\nWhile Umansky\u2019s\npersonal r\u00e9sum\u00e9\nleans heavily toward trophy deals, The Agency has been clear that it\u2019s not chasing only ultra-luxury listings. The Sansone Group\u2019s inventory spans from entry-level homes to multimillion-dollar properties, reflecting Houston\u2019s broad housing mix.\nThe firm was also drawn to Sugar Land specifically for its schools, planning and quality of life, Umansky said, positioning the suburb as a stable launchpad rather than a flashy inner-loop debut.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Days ago, MCR informed investment firm Yucaipa Companies \u2014 which has a controlling interest in the business \u2014 that it would not be able to fund its closing commitment, according to an SEC\nfiling\n.\nAs part of its\n$2.7 billion privatization deal\n, MCR \u2014 which owns high-end hospitality destinations like the High Line Hotel and Gramercy Park Hotel \u2014 pledged to buy $200 million worth of public Soho House shares at $9 per share by the close of the merger. That price point represented an 18 percent premium on what the stock traded at before the deal was announced, but well below the $14 initial public offering in 2021.\nBillionaire Ron Burkle and his Yucaipa entity were set to roll over their existing stake and retain majority control of the new company, according to a press release when the deal was announced.\nMorse was set to snag a seat on the board as vice chairman. Actor-turned-investor Ashton Kutcher was part of a group chipping in new equity capital and joined the board, while Apollo Global Management was said to be refinancing roughly $700 million in debt.\nNow, everything is up in the air. MCR and Soho House could not be reached for comment by the publication.\nBurkle and his firm aren\u2019t throwing in the towel, yet.\n\u201cYucaipa and the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, together with their respective advisors, are engaging with affiliates of MCR, as well as other parties, to secure the funding,\u201d according to the funding, adding that success was not guaranteed.\nSoho House counts 46 locations and more than 200,000 members on its books. The company is credited with leading the wave of members-only clubs that have become a staple of the New York City social scene, snapping up buildings and long-term leases in recent years.\nThe company, founded in 1995, paved the way for clubs like Casa Cipriani, Zero Bond and Aman New York.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The storied St. Regis Houston has a new owner \u2014 and a new identity \u2014 as local businessman Leslie Doggett moves deeper into hospitality with plans for a ground-up refresh of the luxury hotel between River Oaks and the Galleria.\nDoggett, whose family empire\nLeslie Doggett Industries\nspans industrial equipment and car dealerships, acquired the hotel at 1919 Briar Oaks Lane and is planning a multimillion-dollar renovation over the next two years, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n. The seller was not disclosed, and Doggett declined to share the purchase price.\nThe acquisition marks a personal and strategic pivot for Doggett, who said the hotel\u2019s revival is as much emotional as it is financial. He and his wife spent their wedding night there in 1984, when the property was known as The Remington. \u201cThe hotel has excellent bones,\u201d Doggett told the outlet, \u201cbut it just needs a few upgrades.\u201d\nAs part of the deal, the hotel will exit the St. Regis flag \u2014 operated by Marriott International \u2014 and rebrand under Marriott\u2019s Luxury Collection as The Houston Grand Hotel \u2014 River Oaks. Doggett told the outlet that the property is not affiliated with the nearby\nSt. Regis Residences\nHouston condo project.\nOpened in 1982, the hotel later became Houston\u2019s first\nRitz-Carlton\nand famously hosted Queen Elizabeth II in 1991 before losing the Ritz flag in 1997. Doggett\u2019s vision is to restore what he calls the city\u2019s \u201cgrandest hotel experience,\u201d with a family-owned approach.\nRenovations are expected to be designed this year and completed by the end of 2027, overseen by Saddlebrook Equity and Management, an arm of Doggett\u2019s broader business. Connecticut-based HEI Hotels &amp; Resorts has taken over management.\nPlans start with a dramatic lobby overhaul: tearing down walls, restoring 12-foot ceiling heights by removing the current drop ceilings and opening up back-of-house space to create a more theatrical arrival. The reimagined ground floor is slated to include a coffee shop, a barber shop, a restaurant replacing The Remington, a gun shop, a spirits-heavy lounge and other experiential touches Doggett believes guests are craving.\nDoggett told the outlet that the location is nonnegotiable. \u201cThis area is ground zero for Houston hotels,\u201d he said.\nGuest rooms across all 12 floors will be renovated in phases to avoid a full closure, while the property\u2019s event spaces, fitness center and pool deck are also in line for major upgrades. New York-based designer Charlotte Moss is leading interiors.\nDoggett is also partnering on a planned mixed-use development nearby that could bring a 50-story condo-hotel tower and office space to\nPost Oak Boulevard\n.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Three of New York\u2019s biggest real estate players are locked in a legal fight over a UCC sale tied to\nWorldwide Plaza\n.\nOwners SL Green and RXR are asking a New York judge to stop what they call a \u201csham auction\u201d by an entity tied to Gary Barnett\u2019s Extell Development that aims to wrest control of the debt on the 1.8-million-square-foot office tower at 825 Eighth Avenue.\nIn a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Manhattan Supreme Court, the landlords accused Barnett of engineering a rigged UCC foreclosure to seize control of the ongoing restructuring of the $940 million CMBS senior mortgage on the 49-story tower. They are asking a judge to stop the\nJanuary 15 sale\n.\nBarnett claims to own a $190 million mezzanine loan tied to the property and has scheduled a public auction of the controlling entity. But the landlords say Extell has never shown any proof that it actually owns the loan, despite repeated requests. The owners received a default notice in October from Barnett, according to the suit.\nAccording to the complaint, the foreclosure effort is not a genuine attempt to recover on the mezzanine debt but a control play orchestrated by Barnett to give Extell leverage in the ongoing debt restructuring, claiming that Extell has a direct interest in the bonds backed by the tower.\nSL Green and RXR argue the UCC sale is a sham because it was structured to deter real bidders. In their filing, the landlords say the auction\u2019s rushed timeline, lack of proper documentation and restrictive terms all but guarantee Barnett will win control of the property.\nAn Extell spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\u201cWorldwide Plaza is an iconic, well-located asset, and we are ready to execute a robust redevelopment plan that will create an incredible offering in the heart of Midtown,\u201d an SL Green spokesperson said. \u201cThe complaint reveals the lender\u2019s underhanded attempt to interfere with the revitalization of the building and the tenants in our property.\u201d\nKorea-based Shinhan Financial Group provided $190 million of mezzanine debt on the building in 2017. The property is backed\nby $940 million in CMBS debt\noriginated by Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank.\nThe debt\nwent to special servicing\nin September 2024 after law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore vacated 617,000 square feet for Brookfield\u2019s Two Manhattan West, leaving Worldwide Plaza about 40 percent vacant. That space remains empty and the building was only 63 percent occupied as of March, according to Morningstar, down from 91 percent in 2023.\nThat could worsen as Nomura Holdings \u2014 the largest remaining tenant \u2014 plans to slash 75,000 square feet from its footprint by the beginning of 2027. The leftover 630,000 square feet is due to expire in 2033.\nThe property was appraised at $345 million in April, down\n80 percent\nfrom its 2017 $1.7 billion valuation, according to CMBS loan documents. That appraisal drop is expected to cause $500 million of losses to the property\u2019s CMBS bondholders.\nLast month, Morningstar downgraded the rating to junk on the CMBS trust holding $705M of the building\u2019s debt. The special servicer is reportedly negotiating with the borrower regarding a loan modification, according to Morningstar.\n",

        "content": "In the aftermath of the passage of the 2019 rent laws, some prominent real estate leaders still didn\u2019t know the name of a person key to orchestrating what one landlord referred to as a \u201chorror show.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t they know who I am? Ego and confidence,\u201d Cea Weaver\ntold The Real Deal\na few months after the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act became law.\nOf course, Weaver is no longer a stranger to the industry.\nThe renter activist was one of Mayor Zohran Mamdani\u2019s first appointments after he was sworn in as mayor, naming her as the director of the newly revived Office to Protect Tenants. In recent days, news articles have highlighted her past posts on social media, leading to a flurry of attacks from the right and testimonials of her advocacy work from the left.\nBut ever since 2019, more real estate insiders have become aware of Weaver and the bloc she represents. Weaver and her organization, Housing Justice for All, have been a driving force behind policy initiatives most feared by the real estate industry, including the\nHSTPA\n, demands for canceling rent during the pandemic, good cause eviction, expansion of rent regulation throughout the state and calls for freezing the rent.\nIn the lead-up to the HSTPA, Weaver\u2019s coalition appealed directly to lawmakers, who reached a two-way deal without then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Despite\npleas\nfrom real estate executives to veto the bill, Cuomo signed it into law.\nNot all of these efforts have been successful. Rent wasn\u2019t canceled, and though the state legislature passed good cause eviction in\n2024\n, Weaver and other advocates complained that the approved version was\nwatered down\n. The Rent Guidelines Board declined to freeze rents last year, but the new mayor has vowed to do so for the next four years.\nIn the spotlight\nWeaver served as a housing adviser to Mamdani during his mayoral campaign and as part of the newly launched New York State Tenant Bloc, mobilized tenants last year to only support mayoral candidates who supported a rent freeze.\nShe\u2019s also periodically drawn the industry\u2019s ire with\nsocial media posts\nabout rent regulation and other far-left priorities, though not to the extent seen this week.\nSocial media and news sites erupted this week over some of Weaver\u2019s old tweets. One of her posts, from 2017, referred to homeownership as \u201ca weapon of white supremacy masquerading as \u2018wealth building\u2019 public policy.\u201d\nWhen asked about the post, Mayor Zohran Mamdani defended his selection of Weaver for the Office to Protect Tenants, saying she was hired \u201cbased on the track record that she had of standing up for tenants across the city in the state.\u201d He\u2019s also said he\u2019s committed to providing stability for homeowners and would-be homeowners alongside tenants.\nDuring interviews with NY1\u2019s Errol Louis, Weaver said the phrasing of the old social media posts was \u201cinelegant\u201d and \u201cregretful.\u201d\n\u201cI certainly do not think that all homeownership is white supremacy,\u201d she\ntold Louis\non his podcast this week, adding that she was referring to longstanding\ninequities\nin homeownership.\nLast year, as part of a\nTRD\n\u2019s magazine feature,\nThe Debate\n, Weaver defended rent stabilization as a way to provide predictability to renters in the same way that fixed-rate mortgages help property owners.\n\u201cRenters should have access to the same stability, especially as homeownership \u2014 always a myth, but a potent one \u2014 becomes unattainable for millions,\u201d wrote at the time.\nLongtime contentious figure\nThis week was not the first time that Weaver has faced backlash at the prospect of holding a government position. In 2021, she was\nnominated\nto the City Planning Commission, but withdrew her name amid opposition.\nIn her new role with the Office to Protect Tenants, Weaver will ensure that \u201cpro-tenant policy is moved into every aspect of the administration\u2019s housing agenda,\u201d she told Louis.\nThe office, alongside other city agencies, will host \u201c\nRental Ripoff\n\u201d hearings focused on \u201cillegal, unfair, abusive, deceptive, or unconscionable landlord practices.\u201d\nMamdani has repeatedly committed to addressing owners\u2019 costs through property tax reform and other initiatives, such as alternative insurance models, though he hasn\u2019t released many details on how to pursue those actions. Rent stabilization reform would need to happen at the state level, and lawmakers have shown little interest in taking up the issue.\nWeaver\u2019s old tweets have become a proxy fight over fears of what lies in store in the Mamdani administration and to what extent socialist policies take hold. (The City Council\u2019s new Republican minority leader, David Carr, quoted Weaver\u2019s tweets during a meeting on Wednesday and talked about the threat of \u201csmothering collectivism\u201d to property rights and individual liberties.)\nWhile his initial actions as mayor targeted \u201cbad landlords,\u201d Mamdani also\nsigned executive orders\naimed at finding ways to speed up housing construction. Ahead of the election, some affordable housing developers said they were hopeful about the mayor\u2019s plans to build 200,000 housing units over the next decade.\nWeaver has also voiced support for ramping up housing construction in the city. She publicly supported housing\nballot measures\nbefore Mamdani confirmed that he was voting for them. She also warned against housing regulation bills that housing groups argued would thwart the new mayor\u2019s housing plan.\n",

        "content": "Fred Seigel\u2019s commercial real estate firm Beacon Capital Partners is accused of abandoning its commitment to fund a series of biotech incubators, jeopardizing leases in Chicago\u2019s Fulton Market and elsewhere across the country.\nChicago-based incubator firm Portal Innovations filed a lawsuit against Boston-based Beacon, its joint venture partner, last month, alleging the firm failed to follow through on agreements to fund the startup\u2019s operations in four U.S. cities, including Chicago. Beacon owns significant Chicago office properties, including one in the midst of a\n$370 million foreclosure dispute\n, and recently\ntook a loss on a LaSalle Street office sale\nin the Loop.\nPortal\u2019s litigation underscores fears that life sciences investments became over-saturated during and just after the pandemic.\nPortal currently occupies a 53,000-square-foot workspace in Trammell Crow\u2019s lab office building at 400 North Aberdeen Street in Fulton Market. Portal is also a partner at the University of Chicago Polsky Center\u2019s life sciences incubator at\nHyde Park Labs\n, a 13-story commercial building at 5207 South Harper Avenue developed by Beacon and Trammell.\nBeacon, along with its key financial backer, California Teachers Retirement System, had an agreement to fund Portal\u2019s \u201claunchpads\u201d in Chicago, Atlanta, Houston and Boston so that Portal could use its \u201cexpertise\u201d at helping early stage startups with their real estate, equipment and capital requirements, the lawsuit says. The retirement fund owned 98 percent of the Beacon entities\u2019 stakes in the Portal projects at issue, according to the litigation.\nBut at some point in 2024, Beacon and the California teachers \u201clost interest\u201d in life sciences and began refusing to fund capital calls as agreed upon between the investors and Portal, the suit claims.\nSince the dispute began, Portal\u2019s locations across the U.S. have struggled to keep up with bills, including lease payments, the lawsuit alleges. In some locations, including Boston and Houston, Portal launchpads are at risk of shutting down imminently, the filing claims.\nMuch of Portal\u2019s lawsuit against Beacon is redacted, but it states Beacon refused to fund capital calls unless Portal \u201creworked its contractual obligations.\u201d The suit doesn\u2019t specify Beacon\u2019s demands within the un-redacted portions of the lawsuit, but Portal claims Beacon is trying to remove Portal as manager of their joint ventures. Beacon\u2019s refusal throughout 2025 to further fund Portal has caused their joint ventures to lose out on adding prospective members to their rosters at their various lab leases, Portal\u2019s suit claims.\n\u201cThe larger impact is the reputational damage in the life science market, as [Beacon\u2019s] actions have made it appear that [Portal] and the joint venture companies are untrustworthy partners that back out of deals at the last minute,\u201d Portal said in its suit.\nRepresentatives of Portal and Beacon didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nBeacon filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit late last month, revealing more details about the fight \u2014 and claiming Portal\u2019s financial performance has been \u201cdismal,\u201d with losses of over $50 million posted by their joint ventures.\nOver the past few years, life science offices have seen a decrease in interest from the commercial real estate sector amid fears they were overbuilt during the pandemic when traditional office demand imploded. As the general office market continues to recover, investors are less keen to replace their hopes with life sciences.\nIn 2024, Chicago-based\nFulton Street Companies pivoted from developing a life sciences project\nto building a two-tower complex with over 1,000 housing units at 1200 West Fulton Street. Furthermore, investors in developer Sterling Bay\u2019s 285,000-square-foot life sciences building next to the\nfailed Lincoln Yards megaproject parcels\nare poised to take a loss. The property remains vacant and is set to be sold in a bid to cover construction debt funded by Bank OZK. Plus, a separate\n$265 million Bank OZK loan note\nbacking another vacant life sciences property that Sterling built in San Diego was offloaded this week by the lender to another buyer.\nIn Cook County Court in Illinois, Beacon\u2019s motion to dismiss claims Portal\u2019s only capital calls at issue were two rounds totaling just $900,000. Beacon also alleges that it and its partners have invested over $52 million in the Portal joint ventures, plus over $42 million in tenant improvement costs to help build out their workspaces.\nBeacon argues it had no obligation to fund the recent capital calls because Portal failed to secure approval for a 2025 annual budget, a contractual prerequisite for demanding cash. Beacon further alleges the entities have lost about $50.5 million to date, while significantly missing revenue projections.\nThe filing accuses Portal of \u201cmisconduct,\u201d claiming the incubator firm improperly used joint venture funds to pay itself excessive management fees and cover costs for unrelated businesses. Beacon asserts it exercised its right to remove Portal as the manager of the joint ventures last month \u2014 a few days before Portal filed its lawsuit \u2014 due to these alleged breaches of fiduciary duty.\nBeacon further denies that the leases are in immediate jeopardy, stating the joint ventures currently hold about $2.5 million in cash on hand. Regarding the Fulton Market site specifically, Beacon argues it has already met its $15 million contribution cap and has no obligation to provide more funding.\nA hearing on each of the litigants\u2019 various motions is set for 10 a.m. Monday in courtroom 2408 at the Richard J. Daley Center in Chicago, online records show.\n",

        "content": "A Clybourn Corridor retail building that traded at a fire-sale price is starting to fill up, with Farpoint Development and MCZ Development landing a major national tenant.\nT.J. Maxx signed a lease for 26,000 square feet of street-level space at 939 West North Avenue, according to a press release, giving the off-price retailer street-level space at the southeast corner of North Avenue and Sheffield Avenue. The store is slated to open this fall under a 10-year lease, the release shows.\nThe deal marks a milestone for Chicago-based Farpoint and MCZ, which bought the roughly 200,000-square-foot property at auction in\nFebruary 2024\nfor about $20 million from Iowa-based Principal Financial Group. The price equated to $100 per square foot \u2014 less than a quarter of what it fetched in 2004, when it sold for $89 million. At the\ntime of the purchase\n, its nearly 95,400 square feet of retail space was just 15 percent leased, while the roughly 104,000 square feet of upper-floor medical office and fitness component was 88 percent occupied, according to CBRE data previously reported by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe building, built in 2002, currently houses tenants including Fitness Formula Clubs, Iteld Plastic Surgery and Urban Oasis Massage. MCZ has been investing in upgrades, including a refreshed facade and modernized amenities, as part of a repositioning aimed at drawing higher traffic retail to complement the existing health and wellness uses, according to the release.\nMid-America Real Estate brokers Paul Bryant and Jaime Bertsche represented Farpoint in the lease, while Metro Commercial Real Estate\u2019s Gary Greenfield and Steven Baer represented T.J. Maxx.\nFarpoint principal Alex Katz said in the statement that landing the discount retailer confirmed the firm\u2019s confidence in the building\u2019s location.\nT.J. Maxx operates about two dozen locations across the Chicago area, including downtown and nearby Lakeview, according to the retailer\u2019s website.\nThe lease follows a recent pattern for Farpoint, which has been scooping up high-profile retail properties at distressed prices and backfilling them with brand-name tenants. The firm recently announced deals to bring a\nJPMorgan Chase flagship\nand luxury chocolatier Hotel Chocolat to the building at\n830 North Michigan Avenue\n, another once-troubled retail property it acquired at a steep discount.\n",

        "content": "It would be an understatement to say there\u2019s little optimism that Albany lawmakers will do something good for real estate this session.\nKilling the 485x wage rules would create thousands more apartments, but it\u2019s hard to imagine Gov. Kathy Hochul and others defying construction unions \u2014 who basically wrote the rules \u2014 in an election year.\nWith the governor and everyone else focused on affordability, I would also be shocked if lawmakers allow higher rent increases to renovate rent-stabilized apartments, even as\ntens of thousands sit vacant\n.\nWhat about a new tax break or direct funding for apartment improvements? Don\u2019t count on it. Expanding child care is a much higher priority for lawmakers, and it will be expensive. Other funding will go toward offsetting federal cuts. Little will be left for buildings.\nIn another bad break for rent-stabilized owners, Linda Rosenthal\nisn\u2019t running\nfor the state Senate seat being vacated by Brad Hoylman-Sigal. That means she will remain chair of the Assembly Housing Committee, where she is a huge impediment to any reform seen as helping landlords.\nSome legislators are interested in bringing down insurance premiums, not so much to help landlords but because politicians like to go after big corporations. Insurance companies, which have jacked up their rates, would seem like a fine target.\nBut going after them is like stabbing Jell-O with a fork. They are already regulated by the Department of Financial Services, and most probably donate to legislators who sit on the relevant committees.\nMore importantly, if carriers feel they\u2019re taking on too much risk or being treated unfairly by the government, they simply stop writing policies. When insurers withdraw from a particular area or stop covering a certain class of buildings, the remaining insurers can charge more.\nI\u2019m a homeowner who has never filed an insurance claim. Yet insurers have canceled or declined to renew my policy several times. In what other industry do businesses regularly abandon their customers?\n\u201cHello, this is Equinox. We thank you for being a loyal customer, but we\u2019re declining to renew your gym membership.\u201d\nNever gonna happen.\nThe political strategy, therefore, is not to punish insurers but to attract them, to increase competition and add options for building owners.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nOne landlord predicts state legislators will make things worse, not better, for owners this session. \u201cThey\u2019re going to pass\na ton of new rules\n,\u201d tweeted WestHarlm.\nA tenant who WestHarlm discovered illegally rents two rent-stabilized units threatened in front of eight witnesses to kill and then behead him. The landlord called 311 four times to file a complaint but was told there is no mechanism to do so. Tenants, he noted, have 11 harassment claims from which to choose.\nSend your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: It\u2019s notoriously hard to build anything in California, be it housing or high-speed rail. But when a devastating fire or earthquake hits, California suspends bureaucratic obstacles to quickly build back what was destroyed. Check out Kari Hamanaki\u2019s\nstory\nin\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s January magazine on how things are progressing one year after fires ravaged Los Angeles. (Here\u2019s the\nInstagram post\nand the\nLinkedIn post\n.) It\u2019s hard not to think that California\u2019s housing shortage could be eliminated if treated with the same urgency.\nElsewhere\u2026\nDespite some\nnews coverage\n, few people noticed when, two days before Christmas, a garbage truck in East Harlem caused a scaffolding collapse that killed a woman.\nTo my knowledge, no one has estimated how many lives have been saved by Local Law 11, which triggered an epidemic of sidewalk sheds in an effort to prevent fatalities from falling debris.\nAny such analysis, which should certainly be done, must also take into account how many people lose their lives in scaffolding collapses. It\u2019s rare, but then, so were deaths from falling debris before Local Law 11. They remain rare in cities that don\u2019t have an equivalent law.\nThe Adams administration made progress in reducing the number of sheds, but no one will ever acknowledge that it might not make sense to try to prevent every death from a particular kind of accident. The\nconsequences\nof such an effort \u2014 including the use of resources that would otherwise go toward other needs \u2014 have to be measured as well.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$7.73 million\nfor a 2,524-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at The Cortland, 555 West 22nd Street in Chelsea. Shaun Osher of CORE had the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$71 million\nfor a 66,893-square-foot, mixed-use property at 410 West 13th Street in the Meatpacking District. TP Angelo Gordon purchased the property from British firm Epic.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$26.75 million\nfor a 7,000-square-foot condominium unit at 1110 Park Avenue in Carnegie Hill. Eva Penson of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty has the listing.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

The buyer was\nDon Marco Holdings, LLC\n, a Texas company.\nDouglas Elliman\nis marketing the development, which consists of two, 26-story towers.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe priciest commercial deal recorded in South Florida was in Pompano Beach, where an apartment complex at\n275 North Federal Highway\ntraded for $41 million.

        "content": "Billionaire Jeffrey Soffer\u2019s plan to add cabanas and waterslides at his iconic Fontainebleau Miami Beach resort could be swept away next month.\nTwo city elected officials, including Mayor Steven Meiner, joined a grassroots coalition of residents, activists and preservationists in opposing\nSoffer\u2019s controversial proposal\nto add a towering water park-style amenity to the historic 1,593-room hotel\u2019s pool deck, ratcheting up pressure on the city\u2019s Historic Preservation Board days before a crucial vote on Feb. 10.\nThe 22-acre landmark is at\n4441 Collins Avenue\n.\nMeiner posted an image of the planned pool renovations on his Instagram account along with a long caption on why he\u2019s against it, following a Zoom meeting of the MidBeach Neighborhood Association this week.\n\u201cThe resident outcry against this project over traffic, noise, and neighborhood impacts has been understandably loud, and I share these concerns,\u201d Meiner wrote.\nIn a phone interview with\nThe Real Deal\n,\nMeiner\nsaid the Fontainebleau proposal triggered one of the largest waves of constituent outreach he\u2019s experienced, and that the feedback has been overwhelmingly negative.\n\u201cIt is hard to find a resident who is supportive of the project,\u201d Meiner said.\nMeiner and his city commission colleagues won\u2019t get to decide the fate of Soffer\u2019s plan, however. That duty falls on the historic preservation board, which in November delayed voting on the planned renovation to give Soffer\u2019s Aventura-based\nFontainebleau Development\ntime to tweak the height and size of a cabana structure and a concrete tower connected to a network of waterslides.\nMeiner said that his and residents\u2019 objections center on traffic, safety and environmental impacts, and that nothing he heard during the MidBeach Neighborhood Association meeting changed his mind.\nFontainebleau Development reduced the height of the cabana structure to two stories from three stories and slashed the waterslide tower from 12 stories to 10 stories, updated renderings and plans show.\nFontainebleau Development\ndefended its revisions in a statement, saying the revised project incorporates community input and feedback from the first Historic Preservation Board meeting.\u00a0 Fontainebleau Development senior vice president Anthony Stahl said in the Zoom meeting that the poolside upgrades will help boost nightly room rates and fund upkeep of the property\u2019s main historic building designed by the late Miami Beach architect, Morris Lapidus.\nStahl repeatedly downplayed opponents\u2019 assertions that Fontainebleau Development is creating a destination water park that will be open to the general public. He insisted that the slides and amenities are meant for hotel guests rather than day visitors. However, Stahl acknowledged that day passes to use the resort\u2019s amenities would include access to the waterslides.\nHe framed the overhaul as a pivot away from the \u201cspring breaker party scene\u201d toward a more family-friendly, high-end environment.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to have adults popping bottles, partying, loud music,\u201d Stahl said. \u201cThe intent is for all that to go away.\u201d\nNeighborhood leaders questioned Fontainebleau\u2019s assurances.\nMarc Weiss, an attorney who lives in the city, called the plan \u201cthe greatest threat facing Miami Beach today.\u201d\nWeiss claimed he was able to place an online day pass order for 90 adults and 90 children for the existing pool, arguing that the new amenity will inevitably function as an attraction open to the public.\n\u201cTheme parks bring a ratchet crowd,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cIt\u2019s tacky.\u201d\nCity Commissioner Tonya Bhatt derided the pool renovations.\n\u201cMorris Lapidus would be turning in his grave,\u201d Bhatt said. \u201cWe are united, we are angry, we are going to fight this\u2026This is unthinkable.\u201d",

Property records show Scott and Laura Gilbert sold the 6,300-square-foot condo. The Gilberts paid $5.7 million, or about $2,200 per square foot, for the unit in 2011.\nIt was most recently asking nearly $16 million. Jordan Karp represented the Ashleys in the purchase and is listing their Edgewater condo. Last month, the Ashleys listed their full-floor condo at\nElysee Miami\n, a bayfront building at 788 Northeast 23rd Street in Miami, for $5.5 million, the New York Post\nreported\n.\nThe Bath Club unit has four bedrooms and was listed with Bespoke Real Estate. The\nPeebles\nCorporation redeveloped the Bath Club Residences, with 107 condo units and six oceanfront villas, between 2005 and 2006. The 1926-built beach club was restored.\nThe Ashleys\u2019 Edgewater condo has four bedrooms and five and a half bathrooms, spanning 3,300 square feet. The asking price works out to $1,700 per square foot. They purchased the unit in 2021 for $2.7 million, when the project was still under construction by Two Roads Development.\nThe building features interiors by French designer Jean-Louis Deniot, whose portfolio includes the Waldorf Astoria Residences in New York. The unit has a private elevator, 10-foot ceilings and two terraces overlooking Biscayne Bay and Miami Beach.\nMarket America was founded in 1992 and grew into a global e-commerce and product brokerage platform. Its late founder and CEO\nJames Ridinger\nand his wife, Loren, bought a penthouse One Thousand Museum condo tower in Miami in 2021. He died the following year at age 63.\n\u2014 Rachel Stone",

        "content": "Kane County is poised to step into the short-term rental debate, with county officials set to vote next week on a package of regulations aimed at Airbnb and Vrbo-style rentals in unincorporated areas.\nThe proposed rules are headed to the northeastern Illinois county\u2019s board for a final vote Tuesday after months of committee debate, resident testimony and revisions prompted by complaints about noise, parking and safety. The Chicago Tribune\nreported\nthat if approved, the ordinance would mark the county\u2019s first formal framework for regulating short-term rentals \u2014 a growing slice of the housing market that\u2019s increasingly colliding with suburban quality of life concerns.\nThe push gained momentum last fall, when residents from a quiet cul-de-sac urged the county to intervene. Susan Blassick told the county\u2019s Development Committee in October that a nearby short-term rental had brought loud parties, party buses and clogged street parking to her block.\n\u201cWe all bought homes here because of the serene environment,\u201d she said at the meeting, \u201cnever envisioning that a short-term rental would be on our street.\u201d\nIn response, Kane County staff drafted amendments to the county code that would require short-term rentals to obtain a license from the Development and Community Services Department and comply with a long list of operational standards. Similar debates are playing out\nacross the region\n. St. Charles opted for new\ntaxes and regulations\nlast year; Lake County banned short-term rentals in unincorporated areas, while Skokie and\nChicago\nhave explored tighter controls.\nUnder the Kane County proposal, operators would pay a $200 licensing fee, cap occupancy at two guests per bedroom with a maximum of 16 guests, and limit rentals to 12 contracts or 180 rental days per year, whichever is greater. Commercial vehicles would be barred, as would parking campers, food trucks or portable hot tubs.\nOwners\nwould also need to provide proof of insurance, pass safety inspections, test smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and designate a 24-hour local contact.\nThe ordinance would require owners to notify adjoining neighbors by mail before the first rental of each year and post the license visibly inside the property. Violations could result in license suspension or revocation, while operating without a license could trigger fines of up to $1,000. Enforcement would fall to the Kane County Sheriff\u2019s Office, according to the publication.\nNot everyone is satisfied. One community member urged county leaders this week to halt the measure, arguing it effectively legitimizes short-term rentals rather than curbing them. County officials counter that an outright ban wouldn\u2019t touch existing rentals and would leave them unregulated.\nAfter clearing the Executive Committee on Wednesday, the ordinance \u2014 as well as companion measures on noise and trespassing \u2014 are now headed to the full board.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

An affiliate of Blackrock sold the one-story structure at 42701 and 42735 Christy Street.\nThe Christy Street industrial building was built in 1991 and spans 253,500 square feet. Current tenants include electronics manufacturing services provider Sanmina and\ndata center\nliquid cooling system provider DeepCoolAI.\n\u201cThe explosive growth of the AI, power management, electric vehicle, aerospace and defense industries has generated significant and enduring demand for institutional-quality industrial space across Silicon Valley,\u201d Michael Alderman, managing director at Tishman Speyer, said in a press release. \u201cWe were drawn to Christy Street as a part of our core plus strategy for its strong in-place tenancy, quality floorplate, substantial power and parking and the opportunity to gain a foothold in the supply-constrained Fremont submarket.\u201d\nThe purchase marks another industrial space buy in Fremont, which is emerging as a hotspot for such space in the East Bay and the Bay Area at large.\nIn June, Prologis, the world\u2019s largest owner, operator and developer of industrial real estate, purchased an empty 177,000-square-foot commercial and industrial building at\n5555 Auto Mall Parkway\nfor $59 million. The following month,\nconstruction began on the Campus at Bayside\n, an industrial complex spanning 473,250 square feet being developed by CBRE, Clarion Partners and 9th Street Partners.\nSan Francisco-based Prologis previously bought a 246,000-square-foot industrial and research building at 48350 Fremont Boulevard in August 2023 from Blackstone for $86.6 million. Later that month, Irvine-based CIP Real Estate\nbought the 352,300-square-foot Clipper Court Commerce Center\nindustrial park in Fremont for $103.5 million.\nTishman Speyer is active in the Bay Area, developing the Mission Rock office and retail hub in San Francisco\u2019s Mission Bay neighborhood. The global firm also owns industrial real estate within the city of San Francisco. In 2023, Tishman Speyer\nbought a nearly 2.9-acre industrial site\nnear San Francisco\u2019s Bayview neighborhood for almost $32.3 million. The acquisition of 2225 Jerrold Avenue was the first completed through the company\u2019s\nTishman Speyer-Mitsui Fudosan America logistics joint venture\n.\n",

        "content": "Federal regulators are circling an Austin-based real estate operator already under siege from investors.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Alan Stalcup, founder and CEO of GVA Real Estate Group, following a wave of lawsuits alleging he misappropriated as much as $100 million from investors. The Austin American-Statesman\nreported\nthat the probe adds a new layer of risk for the multifamily debt syndicator.\nThe existence of the SEC investigation surfaced after Jackson Walker, a law firm representing a family\nsuing Stalcup for fraud\n, disclosed it had been served with an SEC subpoena in October seeking documents tied to the case. According to the outlet, a Texas judge later ordered the records turned over to law enforcement.\nWhile the SEC does not publicly confirm investigations, an attorney for Jackson Walker wrote in a court filing that \u201cbased on the SEC subpoena, it appears the SEC is investigating Mr. Stalcup for securities fraud.\u201d\nStalcup previously told the publication that he welcomed an SEC investigation into what he described as \u201cdefamatory fictions\u201d in the lawsuits.\nFounded in 2015, GVA operates as a property manager and\ndebt syndicator\n, pooling investor capital to acquire underperforming apartment complexes. Many of those investment vehicles are registered with the SEC as securities.\nCourt filings say Stalcup and GVA own or operate roughly 150 apartment properties, primarily in Texas, Tennessee and Kentucky. According to his firm\u2019s website, it has acquired 43,000 units across nine states and closed $10 billion in transactions since its founding.\nLegal trouble accelerated last year as rising interest rates strained floating-rate debt and exposed cracks in GVA\u2019s capital stack. In June, Barry Sternlicht\u2019s Starwood Capital\nsued Stalcup\n, accusing him of mismanaging three properties and allowing\nliens to pile up\nin violation of loan guarantees. In February, Benefit Street Partners filed suit in New York, alleging Stalcup misappropriated insurance proceeds, commingled tenant funds and engaged in other misconduct.\nAcross more than half a dozen lawsuits, investors claim Stalcup blurred the lines between properties and treated company accounts like a \u201cpersonal piggy bank.\u201d One complaint filed by attorneys for investor Brian Kastleman alleges more than $38 million was spent on personal expenses, including private jet travel, yacht charters and luxury vehicles. Other suits accuse GVA of inflating rental income and falsifying financials to mask deteriorating performance.\nOne filing alleges that in 2023 alone, GVA overstated rental income across its portfolio by more than $20.6 million. Another accuses Stalcup of improperly moving $650,000 between accounts tied to different properties he controlled, according to the publication.\nStalcup has pushed back, filing several counterclaims, including one that accuses Kastleman of trying to tank GVA\u2019s reputation to claw back capital.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The Department of Real Estate conducted an investigation into the matter and concluded that McHarg had purposely done so to lift the information from the exams for educational materials offered by his Real Estate Trainers Incorporated for\nstudents\npreparing to take the state\u2019s\nreal estate license exam\n.\nAs part of the settlement, McHarg is barred for three years from applying for, taking, or participating in any way in an examination for a\nCalifornia real estate\nlicense and is prohibited from holding any position of employment, instructor, management, control or ownership in a real estate business or a business that offers pre-license, continuing education or any type of real estate license exam preparation courses. McHarg himself is barred from holding a real estate license, according to the press release. The state Department of Real Estate does not list McHarg as having a license, and the Secretary of State\u2019s website still lists Real Estate Trainers\u2019 business as active.\nReal Estate Trainers Incorporated and all of its affiliated employees are also barred for three years from applying for, taking or any type of participation in any examination for a California real estate license, as well as offering any type of real estate license exam preparation course or pre-license course that uses questions copied or subverted from Department of Real Estate license exams. The settlement also requires that McHarg be removed as an affiliate of Real Estate Trainers Incorporated.\n\u201cThe subversion of real estate license examination content is something [the Department of Real Estate] takes very seriously,\u201d Jeff Oboyski, head of the department\u2019s licensing division, which includes the education and research and examination administration sections, said. \u201cEnsuring that those who attempt to compromise the integrity of our real estate license exams are held accountable for their actions underscores [the Department of Real Estate\u2019s] commitment to consumer protection.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A proposed 5 percent tax on billionaires in California is propelling another wave of wealth to South Florida.\nLook no further than Google co-founder Larry Page, one of the three wealthiest men in the world, who recently spent a\ncombined $173 million\nto buy two waterfront homes in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove.\nPage\u2019s purchases aren\u2019t shocking. In addition to the proposed California tax, ultra high-net worth buyers have for decades been attracted to Florida for its lack of state income tax, conservative politics and pleasant weather. The region is already home to billionaires, who include Amazon founder\nJeff Bezos\n, PayPal co-founder\nPeter Thiel\nand hedge funder\nKen Griffin\n. To keep their Florida residency, they only need to spend six months and a day in the Sunshine State.\nAnd more are considering moves to South Florida, brokers and other industry insiders say.\nFellow Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who was also shopping for a Miami abode, made an offer to buy a waterfront house in Miami Beach for about $50 million, sources told\nThe Real Deal.\nBrin is buying LVMH Americas Chairman &amp; CEO Michael Burke\u2019s Allison Island home.\nInterest picked up in early December, around Art Basel, according to brokers. That\u2019s when Brin arrived in Miami via his $450 million megayacht Dragonfly, which was docked in Biscayne Bay.\n\u201cWe\u2019re showing property almost every single day,\u201d said Douglas Elliman agent Devin Kay.\nLuxe Living Realty broker Dora Puig said the spike in interest from Californians is \u201cfoundationally strong.\u201d That includes prospective buyers who made their fortune in cryptocurrency, she said.\nThe billionaires, primarily from California but also other parts of the country, are looking from Miami to Palm Beach, where a number of large deals have closed recently as well: In December, fintech billionaire Ronald Clarke, chairman and CEO of Atlanta-based Corpay, purchased a 2.5-acre waterfront compound in North Palm Beach from William Wrigley Jr.\nfor $97.5 million\n. Another $72 million trade closed at the start of the year.\nDanny Hertzberg, of the top-ranked Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker, said he\u2019s the busiest he\u2019s been since the pandemic boom of 2021. Hertzberg is part of the team that represented the seller of the $101.5 million estate Page purchased. He declined to comment on the deal.\nHertzberg flew out to California after the wealth tax idea was first floated. The ballot measure would tax California residents worth more than $1 billion the equivalent of 5 percent of their assets. It still has to secure enough signatures to make it onto the November ballot, but if it passes, it would apply retroactively to anyone who lived in California as of Jan. 1, 2026.\n\u201cOur team has been quite busy. Everyone thought it was going to be a New York-Mamdani story, but it\u2019s been a California story,\u201d he said, referring to the \u201cexodus\u201d South Florida brokers predicted when Zohran Mamdani was elected mayor of New York in the fall. That\u2019s fallen short.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just L.A., San Francisco. It\u2019s every pocket of California that has high net-worth individuals,\u201d Hertzberg said. South Florida, Texas and Nevada will benefit most if the tax becomes a reality, he added.\nThe buyers are interested in properties at the very top of the market. Coconut Grove has benefitted from the boom already \u2014 in addition to Page\u2019s buys, a mystery buyer spent over $100 million in the same Miami neighborhood, on another waterfront property that\nbillionaire Jorge Mas sold in December.\nKay of Elliman said he\u2019s starting to see a bump in activity spill over into big-ticket contracts for ultra-luxury condos at the Four Seasons Residences at the Surf Club. The luxury condo market has performed less consistently than the waterfront single-family homes, but the Surfside development and its sister projects have attracted a Who\u2019s Who of buyers for years.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing that across all of our business,\u201d he said.\n",

        "content": "An Alabama-based insurance brokerage is betting on North Dallas office space, rolling four local offices into a single hub at a prominent building near Central Expressway.\nCRC Group signed a 49,000-square-foot lease at Lakeside Square, the 18-story office building at 12377 Merit Drive. The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat the deal brings occupancy at the 409,544-square-foot building to about 85 percent and adds more than 200 employees to the property by March 2026, with some staff already in place.\nThe move consolidates CRC\u2019s Dallas-Fort Worth presence into one site. CRC Insurance Services, the operating arm of the group, is an independent brokerage focused on specialty insurance underwriting across the U.S. and Canada. The firm was founded in 1982 in Birmingham, Alabama, and was previously known as TIH Insurance Holdings.\nLakeside Square sits at the crossroads of U.S. 75 and I-635, near\nMedical City Dallas\n, a Costco and a growing cluster of apartments \u2014 a site that\u2019s long appealed to back office and financial services users. Built in 1985, the blue-glass building has its own Dallas lore: It originally served as headquarters for Ross Perot\u2019s Perot Systems and even included a helipad. Perot later decamped to Plano, where his former Electronic Data Systems campus is now being redeveloped as\nAT&amp;T\u2019s global headquarters\n.\nNew York-based\nAcram Group\nhas owned Lakeside Square since late 2018 and has poured more than $10 million into upgrades, including revamped landscaping, a renovated lobby, a fitness center and a tenant lounge. The building also features a boutique cafe and coffee bar, amenities landlords are increasingly leaning on to lure tenants back to the office.\nCRC joins a roster that includes Aethon Energy Management, Audacy and personal injury firm Sweet James. Audacy and Sweet James were among several tenants that signed deals at the building in late 2024, helping reposition the offices.\nJLL\u2019s Gini Rounsaville and Trevor Franke represented Acram in the CRC lease, while Lincoln Property Co.\u2019s Kyle Stanich and JLL\u2019s Conor McCarthy and Taylor Dickerson handled the lease for CRC. Rounsaville said the move reflects sustained demand for high-quality office space in North Dallas.\nThat demand is showing up in the data. A recent JLL report found the\nNorth Dallas\nsubmarket has logged roughly 2.9 million square feet of financial services leasing since 2020, outpacing Uptown and Las Colinas.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Texas luxury is settling into a new normal after booming during the pandemic.\nSales volume, median price, inventory and days on market all describe a luxury market that\u2019s growing, just not as rapidly as it was a few years ago, according to data released by Texas Realtors on transactions that took place between November 2024 to October 2025. The five-year trajectory of the Texas luxury market points to a return to pre-pandemic levels as volume swells at a more consistent rate.\nThe number of home sales over $1 million hit the highest level on record in Texas last year. More than 14,400 homes over $1 million sold in 2025, dethroning the period from November 2021 to October 2022, when almost 14,000 homes above $1 million sold.\nThe state has reached a new high water mark for luxury sales almost every year since 2015. The steadiness of the state\u2019s growth was interrupted in 2021 and 2022, when Texas saw a whopping 90 percent increase in home sales above $1 million. That growth slowed rapidly in 2023 when the luxury market abruptly posted a 16 percent decline in million-dollar home sales from the year before \u2014 the only statewide decline in sales in the last decade.\nThe growth rate of million-dollar home sales in 2025 resembles pre-pandemic conditions. In 2018, million-dollar home sales grew by 11.5 percent. Last year, they grew by 12 percent.\nThe market showed other signs of slowing, as months supply and days on market increased in 2025. Both metrics have been on the rise since 2021.\nFrom 2024 to 2025, inventory rose slightly from 8.1 to 8.3 months supply. The average luxury home also spent 72 days on the market last year, four days slower than 2024.\nThe third-most expensive residential sale in Dallas\nthis year, a 15,7000-square-foot six-eight at\n1 Dorset Place\n, sold in 72 days.\nWhile the market is slowing, it\u2019s not stalling. Before 2021, when inventory plunged below 4 months supply and the average million-dollar home sold in just 55 days, Texas luxury homes generally took at least 80 days to sell, and months supply reached double-digit levels.\nThe growth in inventory from 2024 to 2025 is the flattest change between years since the last decade, indicating a settling ratio of buyers to sellers.\nThe average price per square foot of Texas homes above $1 million rose five dollars to $423 last year. Meanwhile, the average price per square foot of all Texas homes decreased from $190 to $188.\n",

        "content": "Buyers looking for new condos in 2025 faced a steep climb.\nNew development contract signings were down 11 percent compared to 2024, according to\nMarketproof data\ncovering deals closed in 2025.\nThe culprit for the lackluster contract numbers was not a lack of demand, according to Marketproof CEO Kael Goodman, but a dearth of desirable buildings.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all a function of the product,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the product is good, people will buy it. If the product is less desirable, even in this type of market, it just sits there.\nThat phenomenon was seen in the strong sales figures a number of newer buildings posted, said Stephen Kliegerman, president of Brown Harris Stevens Marketing Development. On the other hand, when buyers can\u2019t find a suitable condo, they haven\u2019t been taking the next best thing.\n\u201cBuyers are waiting a little bit to have either product in locations that they\u2019re more interested in, or sizes or price points,\u201d he said.\nBoth Manhattan and Brooklyn felt the inventory squeeze.\nIn Manhattan, contract signings fell 12 percent annually to just over 1,400, according to BHSDM. Despite the dip in contracts, total inventory in the borough fell roughly 13 percent to just under 3,600.\nThe deal volume in the borough fell by 3 percent to $6.5 billion, driven by what BHSDM estimates is nearly $1 billion in sales at\n80 Clarkson\n, the ultra-luxury downtown offering from Atlas Capital Group and Zeckendorf Development. In December, the building inked a\n$129 million deal\nfor multiple units, which would be a downtown record if it closes at that price.\nThe building has yet to report sales numbers, but even adding in its estimated contracts makes a dull 2025 look only so much rosier.\nIn Brooklyn, there were just over 1,000 new development contracts signed, 6 percent down from 2024, according to BHSDM. At the same time, the supply of new condos in the borough fell 19 percent yearly to just above 1,300.\nUnlike Manhattan, where pricing has been nearly flat over the last 10 years, Brooklyn\u2019s price per square foot rose 44 percent in that time to $1,385, driven by an outsize number of sales occurring at pricey waterfront developments like Two Trees\u2019 condominium at\nOne Domino Square\nand Naftali Group\u2019s residential offering at\nOne Williamsburg Wharf\n.\nA surprise top performer\nBuyers looking for something new found it, in a way, at\n125 Greenwich Street\n, the top-selling building in the city in 2025, according to Marketproof.\nKnown as The Greenwich, the 272-unit condominium re-launched sales in 2024 following a turnover in the development team and a building rebrand in 2023.\nA Douglas Elliman Development Marketing Team led by Stacey Spielman put 64 units into contract in 2025, according to Marketproof. The sales efforts likely benefitted from steep price drops, with newly listed units asking on average 25 percent less than they were before 2023.\nBut the building also hit some noteworthy milestones, selling its first handful of units asking at least $4 million, including a 79th-floor asking $5 million, or roughly $3,000 per square foot, according to Marketproof.\nGlacier Equities and InterVest Capital Partners\u2019 project at\n720 West End Avenue\nnetted 59 contracts, right behind The Greenwich.\nBoth buildings\u2019 success this year proved \u201cthat once you find your price point things do move quickly,\u201d according to Kliegerman.\nIn Brooklyn, One Domino Square scored 49 contracts for over $130 million, according to the report from BHSDM.\nNo reprieve in sight\nDespite the lackluster numbers in 2025, there\u2019s no sign that 2026 \u2014 or even 2027 \u2014 will be any better for buyers.\nIn Manhattan, BHSDM projects an average of just under 1,300 units to come online in each of the next two years, less than the total contracts signed this past year.\nIn Brooklyn, the situation is even more stark. In the next two years, BHSDM projects an average of roughly 580 units to be delivered, despite the borough averaging over 1,000 contracts per year.\nIf deal numbers fall short again in 2026 though, don\u2019t blame buyers, said Kliegerman.\n\u201cWe believe very, very firmly that there\u2019s a lot of demand for product, but that the lack of new product is actually creating less transactions, not that buyers aren\u2019t interested in purchasing,\u201d he said.\n",

        "content": "Meritage Homes is pursuing a rezoning of a 30-acre site it has under contract in Wellington, with preliminary plans for a 206-townhome complex.\nThe Scottsdale, Arizona-based homebuilder proposes the project for the six-lot site at 16300, 16350 and 16426 Velazquez Road, and at 16275, 16301 and 16421 Rembrandt Road, near\nLion Country Safari\n, the South Florida Business Journal\nreported\n. Meritage, led by Phillippe Lord, filed the rezoning and master plan application in November.\nEach townhome lot would range from 1,800 square feet to 2,100 square feet.\nThe Wellington Planning and Zoning Board and Village Council are to each vote on the project. The proposal hasn\u2019t been scheduled for a meeting yet.\nMeritage\u2019s filing comes as more rural areas of Palm Beach County are experiencing redevelopment, primarily with housing complexes. The area is one of the few sections of South Florida with enough land supply for more sprawled communities.\nWestlake, the county\u2019s youngest municipality that incorporated in 2016, is in a western part of the county. Master developer Minto Communities has approvals for\nthousands of homes\n, commercial space, a school and police and fire stations. Minto bought the\n4,000-acre\nsite for Westlake in 2013.\nIn Palm Beach Gardens, the 4,800-acre master-planned Avenir is taking shape on the northwest corner of Northlake and Coconut boulevards. It has approvals for 3,900 residential units, mostly single-family homes, plus a 300-key hotel, 200,000 square feet for medical offices, 400,000 square feet for retail and a 2,400-acre nature preserve. Coral Gables-based Landstar is the master developer,\nselling off\npieces of the Avenir assemblage to homebuilders in recent years.\nAnother master-planned Palm Beach County community is the 1,200-acre\nArden\n, near Wellington. It is approved for 2,300 homes and is billed as an \u201cagrihood\u201d complex due to a 5-acre farm that allows residents to grow and harvest produce.\nLennar has invested over\n$226 million\nfor homesites in Arden.\n\u2013\u2013\nLidia Dinkova\n",

        "content": "Wilmette was busier than usual in 2025, and not just by North Shore standards.\nHome sales in the lakefront suburb jumped more than 20 percent last year, according to an analysis of preliminary year-end sales records\nreported\nby Crain\u2019s, putting Wilmette among a small group of Chicago-area communities that defied an otherwise flat housing market. Agents on the ground told the outlet that the surge was palpable, even compared to nearby high-end enclaves.\nLisa Finks for instance, a Compass agent who works across several North Shore towns, told the publication that sales volume in Wilmette seemed much busier than in other areas.\nWilmette\nwas among nine suburbs and city neighborhoods where home sales rose sharply in 2025, Crain\u2019s reported, bucking a metro-area market that barely moved. Across the nine-county region, sales ended the year up just 0.2 percent from 2024 \u2014 essentially flat \u2014 which itself was the slowest year for Chicago-area home sales since 2011. Final numbers could shift slightly once final year-end Illinois Realtors data is released, but the broader picture remains one of stagnation.\nAlongside Wilmette, several Chicago neighborhoods posted notable gains, including Little Village, where sales climbed 24 percent, Avondale at 19 percent, and\nHumboldt Park\nand South Shore at roughly 13 percent, each. Suburban standouts included Plainfield, Flossmoor, Schaumburg and Glen Ellyn, all up by double digits.\nA common thread across many of these pockets is relative affordability, especially as buyers grapple with elevated interest rates and years of price appreciation. In\nSouth Shore\n, for example, the median sale price in November was $185,000, according to Redfin, compared with $230,000 in Hyde Park and $276,000 in\nKenwood\n.\n\u201cSouth Shore is still one of the few areas where prices make sense in today\u2019s interest rate environment,\u201d said Greg Faulkner of the Howell-Faulkner Group at Re/Max Premier.\nEven Wilmette benefits from a perception of value, at least within its peer group. The suburb is seen as more attainable than other New Trier Township communities, Finks said, with median home prices just under $1.3 million, compared with about $1.7 million in Glencoe and more than $2 million in Winnetka.\nBeyond price, Wilmette\u2019s strong schools, walkable village center and transit access have regained importance, as remote work fades and daily commutes matter again, Fink told the publication.\nThe broader market, meanwhile, remains constrained by historically tight inventory. Many owners are staying put, locked into low-rate mortgages.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Hollingsworth and Alemayehu Mergia to reverse the sale of the 83-foot-long, 7-foot-wide unpaved dirt alley, the San Francisco Standard\nreported\n.\nIt all started last spring when the couple received a letter from the San Francisco treasurer\u2019s office that advertised an auction on pieces of land where owners had failed to pay their property taxes. The parcels for sale were \u201crendered unusable by their size, location, or other conditions\u201d with bidding starting at $1.\nHollingsworth and Mergia believed they were competing for a neighboring home at 1926 Kirkham Street, submitted a bid for $25,000 as well as an additional $8,000\ntransfer tax\n, taking the money out of their retirement funds to put in the offer. After celebrating their successful purchase at the sealed-bid auction, they realized that they had actually bought the alley next to their home officially referred to on Google Maps as \u201cDirt Alley,\u201d rather than the building next door.\nLast month, Hollingsworth reached out to Wong\u2019s office, asking the newly appointed Sunset supervisor to \u201crepresent me on a recent \u2018street fight\u2019 in San Francisco which needs immediate resolution with the [San Francisco] Board of Supervisors.\u201d\nThough Hollingsworth and Mergia don\u2019t have to have Wong by their side to bring their case before the board and ask it to overturn the sale, they believe having Wong\u2019s support \u2014 and vote \u2014 will bolster their case.\nA spokesperson for the San Francisco tax collector, which organized the sale, said the office doesn\u2019t have a position on undoing the transaction, which has only happened once before in 2017 when homeowners in\nPresidio Terrace\nsuccessfully reversed the $90,000 sale of a street in their gated neighborhood to a\nSan Jose\ncouple.\n\u201cLet\u2019s just get this done,\u201d Hollingsworth told the Standard. \u201cIt would be an opportunity for [Wong] to prove that he can represent a constituent in the right way, see through this bullshit and fix it.\u201d\nWong\u2019s office will likely meet with the couple in person to explain the process in the coming weeks. A majority of supervisors would have to vote to overturn the sale.\n\u201cSupervisor Wong is committed to serving and representing the residents of District 4,\u201d his office said in a statement, per the Standard. \u201cIf the constituent ultimately wishes to pursue a request to rescind the sale, the supervisor\u2019s office stands ready to assist them through the appropriate process with the Board of Supervisors.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Charles Cohen can\u2019t do right by his creditor, Fortress Investment Group.\nThis week, Cohen sold the office building at 3 East 54th Street in the Plaza District to Vornado Realty Trust for $141 million, Bisnow\nreported\n. Steven Roth\u2019s firm applied the $107 million debt it bought against the property over the last two years towards the purchase of the building, which it plans to raze.\nThe sale would seem to be good news for Cohen, who is scrambling to raise cash after a New York judge ordered him to\nrepay $187 million\npersonally guaranteed to Fortress.\nBut the final sale price proved to be a pittance compared to what once was. In court documents this summer, Cohen Brothers Realty claimed it agreed to sell the property to an unnamed buyer\nfor $188 million\n. The funds were expected to arrive by international wire transfer.\nThey never did, though, leaving Cohen with few options to sell the 300,000-square-foot building, in which it owned a 63 percent stake. In stepped Vornado, which moved quickly to finalize the transaction. It\u2019s expected to generate $30 million to pay down the judgment, according to the firm representing Cohen.\nIn a letter to a judge, attorneys for Fortress said the deal was a \u201cvery far cry from satisfying the judgment debt,\u201d claiming the creditor was blindsided by the deal. The company wants to subpoena Cohen for financial records and have a pair of properties put into receivership.\nFortress declined to comment to the publication, while Cohen did not respond to a request for comment.\nCohen also recently sold 623 Fifth Avenue to Vornado for $218 million. That sale was expected to generate $70 million towards paying the debt to Fortress, but only $30 million has been provided to the creditor from that deal so far, according to court filings.\nFortress has been trying to recoup more than $500 million it says Cohen defaulted on. The private equity giant has accused him of shifting assets \u2014 including his Connecticut home and 220-foot yacht \u2014 into his wife\u2019s name, allegations Cohen denies.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The walls are closing in on a once prominent condo deconversion team.\nStrategic Properties of North America, led by Saul Kupperwasser and Yitzy Klor, is facing foreclosure on its Skokie office building. The firm is based in Skokie and Lakewood, New Jersey.\nAttorneys for Byline Bank this week filed a foreclosure complaint against SPNA for a promissory note that has allegedly been in default since August.\nByline alleges that the bank issued a $496,000 note to Kupperwasser and Klor in 2017, but in August they stopped making payments. Byline alleges the duo currently owe $340,000 on the loan.\nAbout the same time that the pair took out the promissory note, they also secured a $397,000 mortgage from Byline on their one-story, 5,400-square-foot Illinois office property at 5009 Oakton Street in Skokie.\nByline is now requesting that a judge order a judicial sale of the building to pay back the note.\nKupperwasser, Klor and attorneys for Byline did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe filing is the latest sign that SPNA is facing mounting financial trouble. The condo deconversion specialists had two proposed purchases fall through in recent years due to lack of financing.\nThe company bought dozens of condos at the 467-unit Ontario Place in Chicago\u2019s River North, but after three years of negotiations,\nfailed to close a $190 million purchase of the remaining units\n. The deal imploded in June 2023 when SPNA failed to put up $700,000 as a show of good faith to the remaining sellers.\nIn 2024, SPNA fumbled a second condo deconversion at\na condo building at 200 North Dearborn\nin Chicago. The condo board voted to terminate an agreement with SPNA to sell the remaining units for $90 million, after the company failed repeatedly to secure the financing needed to close the deal.\nSPNA also recently sold an apartment building at a loss, while listing another for sale.\nLaramar Group\nbought SPNA\u2019s Wave Lakeview apartments for $57 million last month.\nThe seller last refinanced the property for $62 million in 2019, public records show. SPNA converted the nearly 60-year-old building from condos to apartments in 2017 and took out a $46 million loan from Ladder Capital to help fund the deconversion, according to public records. It\u2019s unclear how much total capital SPNA put into the deconversion of the 30-story, 207-unit Wave Lakeview at 420 West Belmont, or if the company paid down the principal on its latest $62 million note from MF1 before selling the property to Laramar last month.\nPrior to the sale, the building had faced its share of challenges. Loan records indicate Wave Lakeview struggled to generate income for SPNA while the company owned and operated it.\u00a0 When SPNA refinanced the property with MF1 in 2019, the lender bundled the $62 million debt into a collateralized loan obligation package, public records show. Doing so made some of the loan\u2019s details public.\nThe loan was watchlisted by its servicer in May 2021 for having a debt-to-service coverage ratio under 1, meaning the building\u2019s income was not covering its operating costs, according to commercial debt tracker MorningStar Credit. It was later removed from the watchlist in August 2021 when SPNA secured an extension on the loan. More recent details of the loan are harder to determine because MF1 appears to have taken the debt off the public market at some point in 2022.\nIn October, the company\nlisted the K Square Apartments\nin Chicago\u2019s Lincoln Park. SPNA converted the 22-story, 268-unit property from condos to rentals in 2018, and listed the building for sale in 2023 with CBRE, before eventually taking it off the market. It is now listed with Berkadia brokers Nick Harris, Pete Evans and Richard Evans.",

        "content": "Texas put its signature on one of its biggest economic development wins yet under a new incentive regime, officially clearing the way for Eli Lilly\u2019s $6.5 billion manufacturing plant in northeast Houston.\nThe final Jobs, Energy, Technology and Innovation Act tax agreement that lured the pharmaceutical giant to Houston was posted to the state comptroller\u2019s website this week, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n. The deal caps a fast-moving courtship that began less than a year ago, when Eli Lilly first applied for the\nincentive program\nand\npublicly disclosed\nits interest in the region.\nThe global drugmaker plans to build the massive facility on 236 acres within McCord Development\u2019s Generation Park, a 4,300-acre master-planned industrial park off Beltway 8 near George Bush Intercontinental Airport and the Port of Houston. The plant will manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients, including orforglipron, Lilly\u2019s closely watched\noral GLP-1 drug\naimed at treating obesity.\nThe agreement offers a clearer look at the economics behind the splashy announcement.\nLilly committed to paying an average annual wage of $102,503, exceeding 110 percent of the benchmark for its NAICS pharmaceutical manufacturing category. The company said the plant will ultimately create more than 600 high-paying jobs, with an initial requirement of 75 jobs and $200 million in investment by the first year of the incentive period. The project will create 4,000 construction jobs for the duration of its buildout.\nMcCord Development will invest $100 million in infrastructure upgrades, while Lilly will handle the buildings, as previously reported by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nTo secure the deal, Sheldon Independent School District agreed to exempt the property from school taxes through 2030, then cap the taxable value at 50 percent for another decade. The district\u2019s board signed off in November, and Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s office added its signature on Jan. 5, finalizing the agreement after a joint announcement with Lilly last fall.\nThe timing of construction remains murky. While the incentive paperwork lists a Sept. 1, 2025 construction start date, no visible signs of work existed following Abbott\u2019s Sept. 23 announcement. Eli Lilly told the outlet this week that it does not have an update on the timeline.\nThe project is part of Eli Lilly\u2019s broader push to onshore U.S. manufacturing.\nCEO David Ricks\nhas pointed to permanently lowered federal corporate tax rates as a tailwind for \u201cintellectual property-driven\u201d businesses, though he has downplayed the role of state incentives alone. Houston beat out a \u201cvery competitive\u201d runner-up, he said, thanks to workforce quality, available space and a collaborative local government culture.\nThose factors are baked into Generation Park\u2019s pitch. The development is home to San Jacinto College\u2019s Center for Biotechnology, creating a direct training pipeline for pharmaceutical manufacturing jobs, with Sheldon ISD already feeding students into the program.\nWhile Houston lacks a deep biotech labor pool, the city has become home to an adjacent life sciences sector, with more than\n700 life science\ncompanies making Houston home.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The fallout from\nLuxUrban Hotels\u2019 spectacular unraveling\nis no longer confined to courtrooms, creditors and locked hotel doors. For a former executive, it\u2019s turning personal.\nBrian Ferdinand, the founder and former chief executive of the short-lived hotel operator, filed for Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy last month, seeking a clean break from nearly $100 million in liabilities tied largely to the company\u2019s failed New York City hotel leases. Ferdinand reported less than $4.5 million in assets against more than $98 million in debt, according to the filing, first reported by\nBisnow\n.\nAt the core of the wreckage are the personal guarantees Ferdinand signed as LuxUrban raced to scale up its master-lease model across Manhattan. Those guarantees left him directly on the hook for tens of millions of dollars after the company stopped paying rent and landlords moved to enforce their claims.\nFerdinand owes $28 million to MAve Hotel Investors, which owns Hotel 27 on Madison Avenue, $6.4 million to the owner of The Herald near Herald Square and $14.2 million tied to the Tuscany Hotel, court records show.\nThe list of creditors reads like a cross-section of LuxUrban\u2019s most troubled deals. Ferdinand also disclosed a $19 million obligation to Wyndham Hotel Group stemming from an abandoned partnership, a $2.7 million judgment related to a defaulted lease at 123 Washington Street and nearly $4 million owed to merchant cash advance lenders.\nHe reported 18 lawsuits filed against him in the year before the bankruptcy, most connected to breached loan or lease guarantees, along with $148,000 in unpaid federal taxes from 2023.\nFinancially, the filing portrays a dramatic reversal. Ferdinand says he is unemployed, with no income, less than $170 in cash across three bank accounts and a repossessed Porsche Cayenne. He is receiving a $30,000 monthly allowance from his father. His biggest remaining asset is a Sunny Isles Beach condo valued at $4.4 million, though it is encumbered by $5.7 million in mortgages.\nFerdinand launched CorpHousing Group in 2017, initially leasing apartments for short-term stays before pivoting during the pandemic to master leasing hotels. That strategy powered a $13 million initial public offering in 2022 and a rebrand to LuxUrban Hotels, pitching the company as a fast-growing disruptor in hospitality.\nThe ambition outpaced the balance sheet. After a short seller report and mounting lawsuits, LuxUrban filed for Chapter 11 in September, only to\ncollapse into Chapter 7 liquidation\nweeks later after abandoning hotels, workers and\nbooked guests\n.\nThough Ferdinand had stepped away from day-to-day leadership, the company\u2019s court-appointed trustee is seeking to pull him back into the liquidation, arguing that only he can produce key financial records.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A Pompano Beach apartment building traded for $41 million, marking a slight discount from its price four years ago, while a Boca Raton rental complex sold for $30 million.\nGreenwood Village, Colorado-based Griffis Residential bought the eight-story, 144-unit building at 275 North Federal Highway in Pompano Beach from Montreal-based Frankforter Group, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The buyer borrowed $29.5 million from Chicago-based PPM America for the purchase.\nAlso, Matthew Paul\u2019s MAP Communities bought the 106-unit Boca Villa Apartments complex at 100 West Hidden Valley Boulevard in Boca Raton from Edwidge Realty and Marina &amp; Briana limited partnerships. MAP took over a $32.5 million loan on the complex, with a $28.5 million balance, provided by Greenwich, Connecticut-based lender Ellington Financial.\nThe deals come at a dubious time for South Florida\u2019s multifamily market. While\nleaseups\nhave taken a hit due to hefty completions in recent years and a slower influx of out-of-staters, landlords also have felt the sting from elevated interest rates and increases in other costs such as insurance, leading some to sell at a discount.\nThe Pompano Beach building was completed in 2019 on a 0.8-acre site, property records show.\u00a0 Frankforter, led by Yaakov Frankforter, paid\n$42.9 million\nfor the building in 2021, meaning the recent sale marked a 4.3 percent discount from the 2021 price.\nThe building, called Griffis Pompano Beach, consists of one-bedroom units to three-bedroom units, with monthly rents ranging from $2,175 to more than $2,895, according to the property\u2019s website.\nThe Boca Raton complex sits on 7.2 acres. It was completed in two phases. The first five two-story buildings with 53 units, combined, were finished in 1988. In 2021, another 53 units were completed in one three-story building and one five-story building.\nBoca Villa Apartments consists of one-bedroom units to three-bedroom units, Vizzda records show. Rents aren\u2019t listed.\nGriffis, led by Ian Griffis and David Birnbaum, is a multifamily owner and manager with a portfolio of 30 communities spanning 9,000 units across 13 national markets, according to its website. It has ramped up its South Florida investment.\nIn June, Griffis paid\n$87 million\nfor the 15-story, 223-unit apartment building at 345 Banyan Boulevard in downtown West Palm Beach.\nMAP Communities was founded in March by Paul, who previously was vice president for Florida at single-family rental homes developer Christopher Todd Communities, according to his LinkedIn. MAP has focused its investment in South Florida, amassing a portfolio of about six properties since it was founded.\nIn other recent South Florida multifamily deals, Ortsac Capital Group bought the 206-unit Ventura Pointe complex at 7850 Pasadena Boulevard in Pembroke Pines for\n$52.5 million\nlast month. It marked a 5.6 percent discount from the property\u2019s 2019 price.\nAlso last month, Greystar and Artemis Real Estate Partners bought the 220-unit age-restricted Everleigh Palm Beach Gardens complex at 3660 RCA Boulevard in Palm Beach Gardens for\n$69.4 million\n.\n",

The site includes a three-story office building that was previously anchored by the Mexican consulate, which moved to Coral Gables in 2023.\nFischer\nplans to demolish and replace the building with a 41-story residential tower with 544 units, 9,400 square feet of retail and 421 parking spaces. Miami-Dade County approved the project last year, records show. Plans for the Arquitectonica-designed project don\u2019t specify if the units will be apartments or condos.\nAn entity managed by Fischer paid $53 million for the assemblage in 2020, records show.\nThe project would mark the first high-rise development for Fischer, a spec home developer and founder of Latin America casino resorts operator Sun Dreams. However, he is under contract to sell the site to Miami-based Key International, led by brothers\nInigo and Diego Ardid\n, according to a memorandum filed in public deeds.\nThe purchase and sale agreement is being used as collateral for the Banco Santander mortgage, records show. It\u2019s unclear if the $65 million loan is for construction of the project. Fischer and the Ardids did not respond to requests for comment.\nKey International has a portfolio of roughly 6,000 residential units, 3,000 hotel rooms, and $2 billion in managed assets, according to the firm\u2019s website.\nKey International and Coconut Grove-based\n13th Floor Investments\n, led by Arnaud Karsenti, are partnering to develop a Nobu-branded, 74-story condominium with 300 units on a 2.2-acre site in Brickell.\nThat joint venture also landed a\n$79.2 million\nconstruction loan in November to build Skye, a planned 327-unit apartment complex within the Parks at Delray mixed-use project in Delray Beach.",

        "content": "The hangover from the craft beer boom has turned into a legal headache for Steve Soble, owner of District Brew Yards.\nWaterman Bank filed a foreclosure suit against the ownership entity of the\nrecently shuttered beer hall\u2019s Wheeling outpost\n, alleging the borrower owes more than $2.3 million in unpaid principal, interest and fees. The complaint, filed in Cook County Circuit Court late last month, marks the latest distress signal in a local brewing scene that has seen a wave of closures from industry titans and neighborhood favorites alike.\nThe lawsuit targets 700 N Milwaukee LLC and its guarantors, Dale \u201cSteve\u201d Soble and wife Kendall Soble. Steve Soble, a 36-year veteran of the Chicago brewery and dining scene who also founded Burnt City Brewing, opened the Wheeling brewery in 2022 as a suburban expansion of his popular West Town concept. It allows District Brew Yards patrons to pour their own beers from a wall of taps.\nBut the taps ran dry quickly. According to Waterman\u2019s complaint, the borrower stopped making payments on the $2.3 million Wheeling loan in April 2024. While the two sides apparently attempted to salvage the deal through multiple forbearance agreements, the bank alleges the borrower defaulted again In August 2025, court records show.\nAs of last month, Waterman Bank claims the total payoff amount has swelled to more than $2.3 million, with interest accruing daily.\nThe foreclosure filing comes just months after Soble publicly announced a \u201cwind down\u201d of District Brew Yards\u2019 operations. In September, reports indicated the 11,900-square-foot Wheeling property at 700 North Milwaukee Avenue was being marketed for sale with an asking price of roughly $3.6 million. At the time, Soble cited a desire to retire and a difficult market as reasons for the exit.\nThe legal action suggests a buyer hasn\u2019t materialized at a price sufficient to clear the debt before the bank\u2019s patience ran out, but it remains on the market with CBRE brokers Tom Svoboda and Dominic Soltero. It is now asking $2.7 million, according to an online\nlisting\n. The West Town property in Chicago is still operating, but the property is also listed for sale asking $4.5 million.\nWaterman\u2019s foreclosure is emblematic of a broader crisis facing the middle market of the hospitality industry \u2014 full-service venues sandwiched between high-end dining and quick-serve chains.\n\u201cThere has been a real pullback in mid-level dining experiences that is not just craft beer-focused,\u201d Steve Soble told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cA lot of places on the high end are doing really well. The middle is being hollowed out.\u201d\nThe craft beer sector, once a darling of retail real estate, has been battered by a perfect storm of headwinds. Inflation has squeezed margins, but a cultural shift is proving even more damaging: Americans are simply drinking less.\nIndustry analysts have also pointed to the rise of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic, which can curb cravings for both food and alcohol, as a growing threat to revenue. Combined with the \u201cDry January\u201d movement extending year-round for many younger consumers, volume-dependent businesses like large beer halls are finding it harder to cover the rent.\nDistrict Brew Yards is far from alone in its struggles. Miskatonic Brewing\nshuttered its suburban Chicago location in Darien\nthis month, blaming the downturn on \u201cpeople drinking less\u201d and the financial strain of a failed expansion. That closure followed the\nhigh-profile exit of Lagunitas\n, which closed its large Chicago production facility and taproom in 2024 after a decade of operation.\nHowever, a\n$12 million foreclosure lawsuit\nfor the Great Central Brewing property on Chicago\u2019s Near West Side filed by Wheaton-based lender T2 Capital in 2023 was resolved without stripping the property from the borrowers. \u201cThe sponsor was resourceful and was able to recapitalize the property,\u201d T2\u2019s CEO Jeff Brown said Friday.\nDavid Avram, one of the original owners and borrowers for the Great Central property, took on several million dollars of additional debt tied to the brewery building over the past year in an attempt to straighten out the company\u2019s financial affairs, and T2\u2019s foreclosure was dismissed in early 2025, court records show.\nMeanwhile, Waterman Bank has requested a judgment of foreclosure and sale for the Wheeling District Brew Yards, as well as the right to appoint a receiver to take control of the property. An attorney for Waterman didn\u2019t return a request for comment. The lawsuit\u2019s next court date is scheduled for a June 29 case management hearing, online records show.\n",

Appleton and a partner bought it in 2021 from other family members following longtime operator Cinemark\u2019s abandoning its lease and closing the theater, ripping out seats, screens and projectors in the process.\n\u201cThe [former operator] mothballed it, stripped out all the equipment and just left it,\u201d Appleton told the Chronicle. While his group explored bringing the facility back as a theater, the building\u2019s poor condition and the opening of a multiplex nearby meant theater operators weren\u2019t interested in moving in. As a result, the team opted to build housing instead, planning for 62 two- and three-bedroom rental apartments at the site.\n\u201cWe want something that is going to endure. We want to stay in this long term. That is our goal,\u201d Appleton said.\nTo bring the project to life, developers will take advantage of two state laws that allow the structure to be taller and denser than currently allowed by zoning regulations.\nSenate Bill 330\ndoubles the permitted density on the site, and Assembly Bill 2011 requires a streamlined 90-day approval. Of the 64 units, 10 will be below market rate, with five affordable to households earning 50 percent of the area median income, and five units\u00a0 meant for households making 120 percent of the area median income. Groundbreaking is expected next year.\nHistoric theaters in San Francisco have been trading hands or floated for renovations or redevelopment over the past year.\nLast April, the San Francisco Planning Commission\napproved a zoning change\nfor the Alexandria Theater to allow for the construction of 75 housing units. In June, the fate of the\nClay Theatre\nwas revealed as its new ownership plots upgrades for 4K digital projection, 35mm film capabilities, new acoustics and accessibility improvements. And last month, the San Francisco Giants\npurchased the Curran Theatre\nfrom Shorenstein family scion Carole Shorenstein Hays.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The seller is a ranch company owned by the late Eugene Kincaid III, an accomplished amateur historian and heir of a historic ranching family.\nThe final sale price is unavailable, but seller\u2019s agent Robert Dullnig with Kuper Sotheby\u2019s International Realty had listed the property for $16.5 million. Seger\u2019s company, BC Frio 5000, secured a $13.5 million loan from Security State Bank and Trust for the purchase.\nAside from some irrigation wells and a 1,000-square-foot cabin, the land remains mostly unimproved, differing little from the \u201c\nOne League and one Labor\n\u201d of land that the Republic of Texas granted to Maria Francisca Sosa in 1838, according to the General Land Office.\nDullnig billed the raw land as a\ndevelopment opportunity\n, ready for \u201cimprovements of your choice,\u201d the listing states. The property includes several buildable homesites, according to Dullnig.\nThe sellers have leased the property as a\nhunting destination\nfor years. The perimeter of the land includes over seven miles of high fence, and five irrigation wells supply water to troughs and tanks, supplementing the Leona River.\nThe land has just over two miles of waterfront on the Leona. It\u2019s also veined by seasonal creeks that add over seven miles of waterfront during high-water periods.\nEugene Kincaid Jr. bought the land in 1948 for $121,000, according to public records. He was the grandson of William Davis Kincaid, who founded the Kincaid Ranch near Uvalde, just northeast of the Leona River ranch.\nEugene Kincaid III counted among his ancestors a veteran of the Battle of San Jacinto, which won the independence of the Republic of Texas. He collaborated with a professional historian in identifying a historic Spanish explorer campsite on the Kincaid Ranch.\n",

        "content": "New York\u2019s CityFHEPS voucher program has a $1.2 billion price tag. Now, the state comptroller wants less of that money going to \u201cbad\u201d landlords.\nIn an audit of the program released Friday, the comptroller\u2019s office found that the city approved units with infestations and other serious concerns for participation in the program. And some tenants have used their vouchers to pay landlords on the city\u2019s \u201cWorst Landlords\u201d list.\nAs such, the comptroller recommended that the program establish a \u201clandlord disqualification\u201d list.\nThe audit is the latest public criticism of the rental assistance program, which serves mostly formerly homeless New Yorkers, and is a source of income to private landlords. Disqualifying specific landlords from the program would cut them off from that income stream.\nThe state comptroller\u2019s office reviewed 45 CityFHEPS cases in the five boroughs. Of those, three had open housing code violations classified as \u201cimmediately hazardous,\u201d including infestations.\nThat\u2019s not only not a great situation for tenants, it\u2019s expensive, the report argued. For audited voucher recipients who ultimately had to move, the program had to pay nearly $119,000 in new brokers\u2019 fees and landlord incentives.\nIn one case, the city\u2019s Department of Social Services approved a tenant to move into a unit with 20 open violations, including mouse and cockroach infestations. DSS paid more than $7,000 to the broker and the landlord to secure the apartment before the tenant moved in. Another CityFHEPS tenant had already been approved to move out of that unit because of similar concerns.\n\u201cLandlords continue to participate in CityFHEPS without having to rectify poor living situations,\u201d the report said.\nFurther review by the comptroller\u2019s office found DSS also approved at least 57 CityFHEPS households to use their vouchers on units owned by landlords on the public advocate\u2019s \u201cWorst Landlords\u201d list.\nDSS said it would establish a landlord \u201cescalation\u201d list, \u201cto enable more intensive reviews of specific landlords.\u201d DSS disputed several of the report\u2019s conclusions, saying it contained several inaccuracies and doesn\u2019t highlight the successes of the program.\nIn a statement to\nGothamist\n, DSS accountability chief Bedros Boodanian blamed the habitability issues on New York\u2019s low vacancy rate.\n\u201cTenants, especially low-income households with vouchers like CityFHEPS, have very few available units from which to choose,\u201d Boodanian wrote. \u201cRestricting voucher use to only pristine landlords would shrink an already microscopic pool of available units, further delaying housing for people who need it most.\u201d\nTo the comptroller\u2019s office, DSS said The \u201cWorst Landlords\u201d list lacks legal enforceability.\nThe audit identified other concerns with CityFHEPS oversight. For example, in thirty out of 75 statewide cases, there was no record of income verification. The comptroller\u2019s office recommended that DSS follow its income verification policies.\n",

Dropbox has been\nretreating from the space\nlittle by little in recent years.\nIf the deal is completed, it will bring\nOpenAI\n\u2019s presence in Mission Bay to about 1 million square feet.

The company is currently linked to another deal at 455 Mission Bay Boulevard, though there is \u201cno confirmation of either deal closing,\u201d a source familiar with the matter told the Chronicle. It is not clear whether the firm plans to occupy both 1800 Owens and 455 Mission Bay or is deciding between the two locations.\nThe 1800 Owens complex totals approximately 750,000 square feet and is located about half a mile from OpenAI\u2019s existing offices in Mission Bay. Dropbox at one point occupied the entire building but began\nparing down its footprint\nduring the pandemic,\nsubleasing out much of the space\n.\nThe creator of ChatGPT has been on a growth spurt in Mission Bay since 2023, beginning that year with a nearly 500,000-square-foot\nsublease from Uber\nacross two buildings on Third Street and continuing the following year with a full-building lease encompassing 315,000 square feet at 550 Terry A. Francois Boulevard. The latter deal marked one of the largest office deals in San Francisco in 2024.\nThough OpenAI\u2019s operations are concentrated in San Francisco, the ChatGPT giant is looking to grow into Silicon Valley. The company is looking to lease up to 500,000 square feet of offices in the global tech hub, reportedly touring offices in Mountain View.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "San Antonio is moving closer to securing a key piece of its Project Marvel vision, putting a $30 million price tag on a trio of federally-owned parcels that city leaders see as critical to reshaping downtown around a new Spurs arena and mixed-use district.\nCity officials are seeking approval to acquire three properties in and around Hemisfair, including a federal office building at 727 East C\u00e9sar E. Ch\u00e1vez Boulevard and two adjacent parking lots at 610 and 611 Indianola Street, according to documents submitted to San Antonio City Council and first\nreported\nby the San Antonio Business Journal. The\nSpurs\nwould front the purchase price under a funding framework the council\napproved\nlast August as part of its broader partnership with the NBA franchise.\nThe office building, controlled by the General Services Administration, was deemed surplus and placed on the GSA\u2019s accelerated disposition list last year. Council is set to vote on the acquisition Jan. 15, following a recommendation from the Planning Commission in December. City officials estimate the federal review process would take 90 to 120 days once an offer is submitted.\nWhile the city would own the properties, the federal government is expected to remain in the office building for up to five years under a leaseback arrangement. Officials say the rental income would cover operating costs during that period. Any future redevelopment of the building would also be constrained by restrictive covenants from the Texas Historical Commission, adding a layer of complexity to long-term plans, according to the publication.\nStill, city staff have framed the acquisition as foundational to Project Marvel\u2019s ambitions. In a memo to the Planning Commission, officials said federal control of the parcels has long acted as a \u201csignificant buffer\u201d between Hemisfair and surrounding streets, limiting pedestrian and vehicular access and contributing to underinvestment in nearby Tower Park.\nBringing the land under local control would allow the city to rework entrances, improve wayfinding and better integrate Hemisfair into the surrounding urban fabric, while opening the door to\nuses more consistent\nwith a dense, mixed-use entertainment district anchored by a new arena, according to city documents.\nMomentum for the broader plan picked up in November, when Bexar County voters approved $311 million in\npublic funding\nfor Hemisfair-area development.\nProject Marvel\u2019s broader scope along with a new arena includes expansion of the Henry B. Gonz\u00e1lez Convention Center, a 1,000-room hotel, a 5,000-seat venue and about 50 acres of mixed-use development. The city already approved a Project Finance Zone, allowing it to collect up to $2 billion in hotel taxes over 30 years. The city is also expected to chip in $490 million, and the Spurs organization committed to $1 billion toward the district.\nThe city\u2019s interest in the site has been public for months. Last year, City Manager Erik Walsh described the building as a priority acquisition, and former Hemisfair CEO Andres Andujar also flagged the property as critical to making Project Marvel succeed.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The final auction price was not immediately clear after the firm issued an initial bid of $451 million.\nIt\u2019s the result of Pinnacle\u2019s bankruptcy auction, in which Summit represented the minimum, or stalking horse, bidder. A confirmation hearing is scheduled for January 15.\nThe auction commenced despite efforts by tenants and elected officials, most recently Mamdani\u2019s office, to delay the sale. The coalition had asked the judge in the case for more time, originally hoping that the city or a nonprofit might be able to draft a workable bid. After Summit came forward as a stalking horse bidder, the city asked for a 30-day pause to evaluate the sale to Summit and explore potential alternatives.\nHowever, the judge rejected that effort in a Wednesday hearing, clearing the way for Summit\u2019s acquisition.\nAs distress grows in the city\u2019s rent-stabilized housing stock, the auction result shows a potential future for thousands of units across the city. Surging expenses and elevated interest rates have eaten away at revenue, at the same time that a 2019 statewide law has limited owners\u2019 abilities to raise rents. Pinnacle placed its LLCs into Chapter 11 bankruptcy owing $564 million to Flagstar Bank, according to court records.\n\u201cWe are deeply committed to New York and understand how critical the preservation of affordable housing is to the success of our City,\u201d Zohar Levy, chairman of Summit, said in a statement. \u201cWe have reached out to the City and look forward to talking with the new administration and residents about our plans to invest in the portfolio and help make New York affordable for everyone.\u201d\nSummit has a national portfolio of regional malls, office buildings and New York City apartments. But the Mamdani administration expressed concern that Summit wouldn\u2019t be able to make the acquisition work while repairing the properties and maintaining rent stabilization. The bankrupt LLCs owe the city more than $12.7 million in unpaid fees and violations, which number more than 5,000.\nThe legal rents on the units are low enough that Summit likely couldn\u2019t maintain an income stream to profitably support renovations and debt service, the city said in a court filing.\nEastdil Secured advised on the auction.",

Last month, Google co-founder Larry Page\nbought roughly\n$173 million of waterfront real estate in Miami, including one $100 million estate and another one nearby for $72 million, per the Wall Street Journal.\n\u201cIn the last probably month or so, I\u2019ve had multiple billionaires from California come to see several different listings that I have,\u201d Devin Kay, a Miami-based agent with Douglas Elliman, told the Post. \u201cSo there\u2019s definitely a huge wave of them, it appears they are either\nbuying properties in Miami\nor in the market to buy properties, and will once they find something here shortly.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been seeing a huge influx from California ever since Covid,\u201d Kay added. \u201cIn the last three or four years, I\u2019ve seen more buyers from California than I ever have in my entire career. But I would say the megabillionaires or the very, very wealthy people from California \u2014 that is definitely more recent as of the last, maybe two or three months.\u201d\nSimply put, these ultra-wealthy buyers are looking to escape the possible ballot measure in California. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty obvious why these guys are doing what they\u2019re doing in Miami,\u201d Kay said.\nBut billionaires aren\u2019t the only ones leaving California, and this trend isn\u2019t new among the average person.\nOf the more than 2.5 million one-way trips using\nU-Haul\nvehicles last year, the difference between number of people leaving and the number of people arriving\nwas higher in California\nthan in any other state, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing data from U-Haul. The Golden state has had the biggest net outflow for six years in a row. Of California U-Haulers, 50.6 percent of the moving company\u2019s one-way customers left, while 49.4 percent arrived.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "On Thursday afternoon, a group of tenants gathered at the corner of West 55th Street and Sixth Avenue.\n\u201cDon\u2019t let our homes be sold to another slumlord!\u201d they said.\nJust a few blocks away, a very different gathering was taking place: an auction for those same homes.\nAt the law offices of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, bids were circulating for more than 5,000 mostly rent-stabilized apartments. They are the property of Joel Wiener\u2019s Pinnacle Group, which had put them into bankruptcy.\nWe\u2019ve heard the auction started Thursday morning and went into the night. But the winner was confirmed at 4 p.m. on Friday: Summit Properties, run by chairman Zohar Levy, is\nslated to be the new owner\nof the units.\nIt\u2019s a deal that\u2019s been much scrutinized. The city has raised concerns about the profitability of the minimum bid and sought to delay the auction. Tenants obviously consider Summit to be a slumlord. On Wednesday, reporting from Bisnow\nrevealed\nconnections between Summit and Wiener\u2019s brother Jonathan Wiener.\nBut beyond the back and forth about the sale price and Summit\u2019s stewardship, the pushback is, in my estimation, really about tenants and the Mamdani administration sensing an opportunity to take these units outside the purview of a traditional private landlord and into something\u2026 else.\nWhat that something else is, well, they haven\u2019t quite worked that out. The words \u201ccooperative,\u201d \u201cpreservation\u201d and \u201ccommunity land trust\u201d have been bandied around. I\u2019ve written before about the\nvery real and bold dreams of alternative ownership\nfrom advocates and city officials. But so far there\u2019s no clear vision of what tenants and Mamdani want for these units.\nWhat is clear is that they have a limited time to get it. A delay would have given them time to think and plan, but that effort was\nthrown out by the bankruptcy judge\n. Summit now all but holds the keys. There\u2019s a hearing scheduled to confirm the auction result on January 15, giving the city just days to throw around its weight.\nIt\u2019s not looking so good right now for the city, but what could happen next is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have so many examples that sort of show us what\u2019s possible here,\u201d Ariel Hirsch of the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board told me at the rally.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWho is buying rent-stabilized buildings? Since the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 gutted the ability of landlords to raise those rents, it\u2019s been said that rent-stabilized buildings are worth next to nothing. But clearly, someone is willing to pay for them. We\u2019ve already profiled Peter Hungerford. This auction will give us another name. We\u2019re hearing it\u2019s a lot of local long-term landlords who plan to stay in the business. Got info about the folks getting into the rent-stabilized game as everyone is getting out? Email\nlilah.burke@therealdeal.com\n.\nElsewhere:\n\u2014 Mamdani has\nendorsed\nClaire Valdez, a 36-year-old state Assembly member from Queens, in the race to represent New York\u2019s seventh district in Congress. The district is prime \u201cCommie Corridor\u201d territory, incorporating parts of Bushwick, Ridgewood, Clinton Hill, Williamsburg, Greenpoint and the mayor\u2019s own Astoria. Valdez is a fellow member of the Democratic Socialists of America. The seat was previously occupied by Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez and is also being pursued by Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso.\n\u2014 More red light cameras are heading to New York City streets,\nwrites\nGothamist. The Department of Transportation has a goal of 600 cameras by the end of the year, up from 150.\nA thing we learned:\nA growing number of Americans are getting their mortgages from places that aren\u2019t banks. That number is now 64 percent, up from 42 percent in 2014.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$14 million\nfor 53 West 53rd Street, 59B. The Midtown Central condo is 3,200 square feet. The property was last sold as a new development in 2020 for $12.8 million.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$15.2 million\nfor 4275 Boston Road. The Eastchester industrial building is 72,248 square feet. UPS acquired the property from Excelsior Investors, who purchased the site five years ago for $8.1 million.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $11.9 million for 50 Bridge Park Drive, Unit 26A.

        "content": "Hyperion Group won increased incentives for its delayed Boynton Beach multifamily project in a deal presumed to be the local Community Redevelopment Agency\u2019s biggest-ever tax increment financing agreement.\nThis week, the\nBoynton Beach\nCRA approved a bump to $11.5 million from $9 million for the project that\u2019s expected to include 371 residential units, 25,600 square feet of retail space and a parking garage with 633 spaces, the South Florida Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe CRA also extended the term of the TIF agreement to 14 years from 12.\nThe eight-story project, called Ocean One, has been in the works since at least 2023, when the city\napproved the development.\nWinter Properties was part of the partnership at the time. Construction was expected to start in early 2024 and take two years.\nAn affiliate of Miami-based Hyperion and New York-based Winter paid $12 million for the 3.7-acre development site at 114-222 North Federal Highway in 2021. Washington Real Estate Partners was the seller.\nThe increased subsidy is less than what Hyperion requested. The developer asked the CRA last year to raise the incentive to $16 million and stretch the deal to 15 years, citing a shifting economic landscape since the agreement was inked in May 2024.\nThe site is just north of Boynton Beach\u2019s downtown core. Arquitectonica is designing the development.\nCRAs can deploy taxpayer dollars to spur investment in redevelopment zones, often using TIF agreements to rebate a portion of future property tax revenue generated by developments.\nHyperion pointed to rising construction costs, persistent inflation, elevated interest rates, higher insurance premiums and uncertainty around tariffs, all of which it said had eroded the project\u2019s feasibility, in its request for additional subsidies.\nAn independent analysis commissioned by the CRA and conducted by Washington, D.C.-based Abramson &amp; Associates largely backed that assessment, finding Hyperion\u2019s revised cost projections \u201creasonable\u201d and concurring that broader economic conditions had worsened since the earlier agreement.\nCity officials previously described the $9 million incentive as the largest TIF package in the CRA\u2019s history.\nThe property sits within Boynton Beach\u2019s 2.6-square-mile redevelopment area, which has drawn interest as developers look for relatively cheap land between\nBoca Raton\nand\nWest Palm Beach\n.\n\u2014Rachel Stone",

That\u2019s in addition to the five units BGI bought for $7.9 million in 2023, according to property records.\nThe property is adjacent to BGI\u2019s\nAlba Palm Beach\n, a 22-story, 55-unit condominium set for completion this spring. Alba is 70 percent pre-sold, Baboun confirmed. BGI financed the purchase with a $25.6 million loan from a Linkvest Capital affiliate, according to property records.\nThe sites total 2.2 acres and 200 feet of waterfront, Baboun confirmed.\nThe developer is in the approval process for a second condo project tentatively dubbed Alba Reserve and slated for 31 stories and 87 units, according to city planning documents. BGI tapped Carlos Ott and Spina O\u2019Rourke + Partners as the architects for the project. The tower will rise 360 feet, and units will be larger than in the adjacent Alba project, with square footage starting at 3,000 square feet, he confirmed. Baboun is also\nconsidering branding the project\n.\n\u201cIt\u2019s early to know what it\u2019s going to be,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m in concept design, this is the exciting part.\u201d\nWhile the project is in early stages, Baboun made clear he is going for a luxe client with a bigger budget than his first West Palm Beach tower, where prices started at $2.5 million.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going high end all the way,\u201d he said, noting the strength of the market over $6 million.\nNaranjo is a local resident and real estate investor with a portfolio of properties throughout Palm Beach County, records show. He and his wife Beatriz Corrales bought the single-family home at 4720 North Flagler Drive for $1.7 million in 2014 and have it homesteaded.\nAfter the developer acquired the 1.7-acre Alba site for $5.8 million in 2020, Naranjo and his family members started acquiring units in the neighboring condo buildings, anticipating future developer interest. Records show they spent about $2 million buying the units.\nThe two planned towers are part of\na deep pipeline of condo projects\nin West Palm Beach that total more than 2,000 units. The rapid market growth has raised speculation about possible saturation, but Baboun said he sees \u201cdepth\u201d in the market.\n\u201cWe\u2019re conservative with our pipeline, we\u2019re in no hurry to launch projects as we speak,\u201d he said, adding that sales will not launch for this second tower for another year or two.\nBaboun said he sees a severe shortage of existing waterfront condos in the city.\nOther developers see it, too. Huizenga Holdings and Integra Investments are planning a $2 billion redevelopment of the waterfront around Rybovich Marina at 4200 North Flagler Drive that will include four towers with more than 660 residential units. Toronto-based Great Gulf is planning a 32-story, 97-unit tower at 5400 North Flagler Drive, a site it bought for\n$28.5 million\nin 2024.",

        "content": "Gov. Gavin Newsom\nis taking aim at institutional investors making purchases in the residential market.\nFollowing a\nsimilar announcement by President Donald Trump\n, Newsom is\nplanning to work\nwith local legislators to prevent private equity and hedge fund investors and other corporate entities from purchasing homes in California, the Mercury News reported, citing communications with the governor\u2019s office.\n\u201cThe fact is that large investors are purchasing homes faster than families can buy them,\u201d the governor\u2019s office said. \u201cThe governor believes that working families shouldn\u2019t be competing with large, well-capitalized investors.\u201d\nNewsom shared his approach in his State of the State address on Thursday.\n\u201cThere is another urgent area requiring our attention. That\u2019s institutional investors snatching up homes by the hundreds and thousands at a time, crushing the dream of home ownership, and forcing rents too damn high for everyone else. It\u2019s shameful that we allow private equity firms in Manhattan to become the biggest landlords in many of our cities,\u201d Newsom said.\n\u201cOver the next few weeks, we will work with the Legislature to combat this monopolistic behavior, strengthen accountability, and level the playing field for working families. That means more oversight and enforcement, and potentially changing the state tax code to make this work,\u201d he said.\nAbout 3 percent of single-family homes in California are owned by large landlords; publicly traded\nInvitation Homes\nis the largest owner, according to a 2024 study by the California Research Bureau cited by the Mercury News. Large\ninstitutional landlords\nown less than 1 percent of total U.S. single-family housing inventory, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company analysts said in a statement this week, per the Mercury News.\nAfter Trump announced his intentions to take on institutional investors in residential real estate, stock share prices of single-family landlords fell by as much as 10 percent, according to the Mercury News. \u201cAt the risk of whistling past the graveyard, we could argue that the dip in the stocks presents a buying opportunity,\u201d JPMorgan analysts said in their report.\nNewsom\u2019s announcement is already being well received in the state legislature. Last year, the state assembly approved a bill that would ban large single-family residential property owners from buying and leasing more homes. The measure ended up stalling in the state Senate amid opposition from real estate agents and the California Apartment Association.\n\u201cHaving the governor\u2019s backing and support is going to be crucial and very helpful,\u201d Assemblymember Alex Lee, who authored that bill, said, vowing to pursue it again this year. Newsom has not endorsed a specific proposal.\nState Senator Scott Wiener also supports legislation targeting corporate landlords but shies away from policies that could choke housing production. \u201cThere\u2019s been a desire to do something about the gobbling up of single-family homes by institutional investors for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is an issue that we need to deal with.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A Chicago developer is testing the city\u2019s appetite for new housing in the South Loop, proposing a 19-story apartment building.\nA venture led by Vahooman Mirkhaef filed a zoning application to build a 237-unit residential building at 557\u2013571 West Polk Street. The proposal would replace a two-story office building that currently serves as the headquarters of Environmental Group Services, Mirkhaef\u2019s environmental consulting firm, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nDetails on construction costs and timing were not disclosed, but the plan would add to a\nsparse downtown\npipeline. Financing challenges over the past few years have sidelined many large projects, even as rents have rebounded sharply.\nJust three large-scale apartment developments totaling fewer than 600 units are slated to be completed downtown in 2026, according to Integra Realty Resources. That shortage has helped push rents up more than 8 percent, year over year, in the third quarter of 2025, the firm said.\nSome new building permits for apartments near the city\u2019s core are starting to take shape, however. Across the water in River North, a full building permit was issued last week for\nZSD\u2019s\nmixed-use development at 310 West Huron Street, paving the way for construction to begin on a 149-unit residential project with ground-floor retail. The site, which stretches along Huron Street from Franklin Street to Orleans Street, is currently occupied by a parking lot.\nMirkhaef\u2019s venture has owned the Polk Street property since 2003, according to the zoning filing. The original purchase price does not appear in Cook County property records. Mirkhaef did not respond to requests for comment from the publication.\nThe proposal includes 102 off-street parking spaces and would fall under Chicago\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance.\nPlans\ncall for 12 affordable units to be built on site and another 12 elsewhere in the 28th Ward, with an in-lieu fee covering the remaining obligation.\nMirkhaef is also a controversial figure in local real estate and business circles. He previously operated Cub Terminal, a\nsuburban logistics depot\n, and in 2021 pleaded guilty to paying bribes to former state\nSen. Martin Sandoval\nto aid that business, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. In 2024, federal prosecutors declined to oppose his appeal to overturn the conviction.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The home appears in the show\u2019s seventh season, which premiered this week, Block Club Chicago\nreported\n.\nOwners Joe Bergantino and Ricky Gonzalez said HGTV reached out in late 2024 about a potential appearance, without initially disclosing the show. When they learned the\nCandyland House\nwas being considered for \u201cUgliest House in America,\u201d the couple took it in stride. Gonzalez told the outlet that they started laughing.\nThe show, hosted by comedian\nRetta\n, tours some of the country\u2019s most over-the-top fixer-uppers before selecting one for a full renovation led by \u201cSin City Rehab\u201d designer\nAlison Victoria\n. The winning home gets a fast-tracked overhaul that would otherwise take years for most owners to tackle.\nIn 2022. Bergantino and Gonzalez bought the house built in 1891 and have been slowly restoring it while documenting the process on Instagram. Longtime\nRogers Park\nresidents know the home for its candy-colored exterior and wildly imaginative interiors, a legacy of artists Jackie Seiden and the late Don Seiden, who coated nearly every surface in pastel hues, sometimes accented with glitter.\nWhen the Seiden family sold the house in 2021, neighbors worried the next owners might strip away its personality. Bergantino and Gonzalez promised to preserve the home\u2019s\neccentric spirit\n, and say that won\u2019t change even if HGTV selects it for the renovation.\n\u201cNo chance in hell would the renovation ever be black, white, gray or beige,\u201d Bergantino told the publication.\nFilming took place in June, with a 12-hour shoot expected to be edited down to a brief segment. The couple paused their own renovation work once they learned they\u2019d be featured, figuring an untouched interior might improve their odds of winning the makeover.\nWithout the\nHGTV\nboost, they estimate it would take roughly a decade to complete their plans. If selected, the transformation would take about six weeks \u2014 a dramatic shift in both timeline and cost.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The project, deemed Sutro Cove, would rise on a site owned by longtime residents that live in two homes on nine lots, which firm founder Stanley Saitowitz said his team plans to subdivide into 20 units.\n\u201cThe property actually belongs to a family that grew up there,\u201d Saitowitz told SF Gate. \u201cWe\u2019ve done quite a few buildings around the city that present this\u2026 modern interpretation of the traditional texture of the city, and that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the design.\u201d\nThe buildings would feature floor-to-ceiling windows and inset balconies facing the Pacific Ocean. Units would feature repeating bay windows that Saitowitz said would create a \u201cwaving facade\u201d mimicking the ocean waves below. Residences at Sutro Cove would range from studios to four-bedroom units. Two of the apartments in the building would be set aside as deed-restricted\naffordable housing\nfor\nresidents making 80 percent\nof the area\u2019s median income \u2014 $87,300 for one person or $124,700 for a household of four.

Sutro Cove\u2019s design is inspired by the recently completed \u201cHouse of Fog\u201d at 2117 46th Avenue in the\nSunset District\n, which Stanley Saitowitz | Natoma Architects designed. That two-unit property is centered around a central courtyard and served as \u201ca prototype for the thinking around these houses,\u201d Saitowitz said.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Starwood is expected to file the foreclosure Friday, ending Todd Interests\u2019 run at the property.\nTodd\nsaid his firm owes roughly $230 million on the building and won\u2019t contest the action. The decision, he said, comes down to math that no longer works: elevated interest rates, soft downtown values and apartment occupancy that has slipped below 80 percent.\n\u201cWith our debt balance, the interest rate environment and property values downtown, we don\u2019t see a path to us recouping our remaining equity,\u201d Todd told the publication, adding that negotiations with\nStarwood\nwere cordial. \u201cIn 35 years, our firm has never lost money \u2014 this is the first year that it\u2019s happened.\u201d\nDallas-based Todd Interests and partners poured about $460 million into transforming the long-vacant, 1.5 million-square-foot tower at 1401 Elm Street. Opened in 1965 and shuttered in 2010 as office demand collapsed, the building sat empty for a decade before becoming one of the largest urban restoration projects in the country and the biggest in\nDallas\nhistory.\nThe redevelopment converted the mid-century office monolith into a blend of apartments, hotel rooms, offices and retail, backed by heavy public incentives. Todd once billed the financing as the largest historic tax credit deal in\nTexas\n, anchored by roughly $100 million in historic credits and $50 million in city tax increment financing.\nTodd told the outlet that more than $150 million has already been repaid to tax credit investors, including Stonehenge Capital and AHP, Warren Buffett\u2019s tax-credit arm. The project was refinanced with Starwood three years ago, a deal that allowed Todd and major investor Moriah Real Estate to recoup about 90 percent of their investment. Much of that capital was plowed back into the building in hopes a rebound would follow.\nIt didn\u2019t. \u201cThe values aren\u2019t there,\u201d Todd said. \u201cThe loan is due, and we\u2019re not going to continue to pay.\u201d\nThe foreclosure comes shortly after Todd Interests sold its stake in the nearby East Quarter redevelopment to J.P. Morgan Asset Management.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "With the Compass and Anywhere Real Estate\u2019s mega-merger closed months ahead of schedule, the residential industry is now in the wait-and-see phase for the ripple effects from the seismic deal.\nThe earliest symptom so far is New York City\u2019s publicists, agents and executives tapping the acquisition as a hook to explain their next moves.\nEarlier this week, the companies announced that the proposed acquisition, valued at $1.6 billion, had\ncleared the waiting period\nfor antitrust regulatory review and would likely close by Friday, even though the firms initially said the deal likely wouldn\u2019t be finalized until late 2026. Stockholders\nvoted to approve\nthe merger on Wednesday.\nThe next morning, an email from a publicist landed in my inbox, flagging the split of one of Compass\u2019 top teams in Bergen County, New Jersey, a move she billed as \u201cparticular notable given the timing of the $1.6 billion merger\u201d and her client, Max Stokes\u2019, status as a founding member of the brokerage\u2019s Ridgewood outpost.\n\u201cIf I was going to make a move, this would be the perfect time to do it,\u201d said Stokes, who isn\u2019t leaving Compass, but breaking from his partner Megan Fox to launch his own \u201csmall and mighty\u201d team. He called the merger an \u201cinflection point\u201d and said Compass growing bigger was a \u201cgreat thing\u201d even as he aims to shrink his operation.\nStill, some have cited the acquisition among the reasons for their departures from Compass. On Wednesday, just before news of the deal closing broke, a New York City and Westchester agent sent an email announcing her move to Brown Harris Stevens, and in it, she wrote that \u201cthe acquisition of Anywhere Brand along with the\nZillow Lawsuit\nnews took attention and resources away from agents.\u201d\nCompass and Anywhere announced their agreement to merge in September, sending shockwaves through the industry, still reeling from Compass\u2019 earlier\n$444 million acquisition\nof @properties and Christie\u2019s International Real Estate.\nThe proposed deal stipulated that Compass CEO Robert Reffkin would lead the merged companies and that brands would continue to operate independently. On Friday, Reffkin and executives with Anywhere\u2019s subsidiaries, including the Corcoran Group CEO Pam Liebman, presented a united front, posting a graphic with all of the brands\u2019 logos with the tagline \u201cBetter Together\u201d on social media.\nThe news raised questions about how the well-known names would operate under one roof and whether agents in Anywhere\u2019s network would remain with their firms under the Compass umbrella. Since then, many independent brokerages, especially in New York City, have\ntouted the deal\nas a boon for their businesses.\n\u201cBigger isn\u2019t always better,\u201d Brown Harris Stevens CEO Bess Freedman told\nThe Real Deal\nin September. \u201cNot everyone wants a big company.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s too soon to tell whether that pitch will pan out. In November, Zillow\npublished a report\nshowing that about half of Anywhere agents surveyed by the platform said they would consider leaving if the acquisition made it across the finish line.\nHowever, on further inspection, the results weren\u2019t particularly revelatory \u2014 they included responses from just 122 brokers in Anywhere\u2019s 300,000-agent network, according to a Zillow spokesperson, who also said he didn\u2019t have the breakdown of which firms the agents responding belonged to.\nThe data we do have shows the ebb and flow of top producers among legacy firms is alive and well. including one of Douglas Elliman\u2019s leading Brooklyn brokers, Lindsay Barton Barrett, who on Tuesday\nbrought her team\nto the brokerage. Last month, Heather Domi, a New York City and South Florida agent and co-founder of the New York Residential Agent Continuum,\nleft Compass\nto join Elliman.\nNot so fast\u2026\nNew York City\u2019s new development market logged a\nlackluster year\nin 2025.\nBuyers signed contracts for 2,750 new development properties across Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, down 11 percent from the total in 2024, Marketproof data shows. The firm\u2019s CEO Kael Goodman chalked the dip up to inventory, especially in Manhattan and Brooklyn, failing to keep pace with demand \u2014 an issue several new development players\nexpect to continue\nplaguing the market in 2026.\nLast year, Manhattan nabbed 1,400 inked deals last year, marking a 12 percent annual decrease, while inventory in the borough fell 13 percent year-over-year. In Brooklyn, contract signings dropped 6 percent to roughly 1,000, while inventory declined 19 percent.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe most expensive sale to hit the city rolls this week was for a townhouse at 22 East 78th Street, which closed for roughly $10.5 million. The five-story home, which sold to an anonymous LLC with an address in Washington D.C., last traded in 2015 for $12.6 million.\nThe townhouse spans 5,500 square feet and has five bedrooms and six bathrooms. It also features a terrace, landscaped garden, chef\u2019s kitchen and five fireplaces.\nCompass\u2019 Oliver Han had the listing.\n",

        "content": "To start the year, Marc Holliday\u2019s SL Green is straddling two very different realities in Manhattan\u2019s office market. The contrast is hard to miss.\nOn one side is\n100 Park Avenue\n, where the real estate investment trust looks firmly in control. Selling a minority stake in the building to Rockpoint at a $425 million valuation gave SL Green a clean, early win as it kicks off a planned $2.5 billion selloff.\nThe move came just weeks after the firm bought out Prudential\u2019s 49 percent stake at a $360 million valuation, put in fresh equity and quickly turned around and sold an interest at a higher mark.\nThat kind of sequencing sends a message: this isn\u2019t a fire sale. The 900,000-square-foot tower is 95 percent leased, buoyed by Alvarez &amp; Marsal\u2019s 220,000-square-foot deal, and sits just south of Grand Central; it\u2019s exactly the kind of asset that\u2019s still drawing capital.\nBy selling partial interests instead of whole buildings, SL Green is freeing up cash to deal with high interest rates while keeping a hand on the wheel. Management has framed the selloff as balance-sheet management, not a pullback, and has already said it plans to be back buying this year.\nAcross Midtown, though, the tone is much more combative. At Worldwide Plaza, SL Green and RXR are fighting in court to\nblock a UCC foreclosure\nthey say is designed to wrest control of the property rather than recover mezzanine debt. The lawsuit against Extell Development paints the auction as rushed, restrictive and tilted to scare off real bidders.\nIt\u2019s a high-stakes fight over who gets leverage in restructuring nearly $1 billion of CMBS debt.\nThe backdrop is ugly. Worldwide Plaza is only about 63 percent occupied, lost Cravath as its anchor tenant and was appraised at $345 million last year, down sharply from its pre-pandemic peak.\nTogether, the properties show SL Green playing both sides of the cycle: cashing in where demand and liquidity still exist and digging in where the path forward depends less on leasing wins and more on control, timing and the courts.\nThere\u2019s been no shortage of New York real estate headlines in the early days of 2026. Here\u2019s some of the week\u2019s other big stories.\nJudge rejects Mamdani\u2019s bid to pause Pinnacle auction, paves way for Summit takeover\nIn the first big test of Zohran Mamdani\u2019s real estate policy plans, a bankruptcy judge rejected the city\u2019s bid to pause the auction of over 5,000 rent-stabilized apartments. The decision allows Summit Properties to proceed with a possible takeover of Joel Wiener\u2019s Pinnacle Group portfolio, though results of Thursday\u2019s auction still weren\u2019t public by the time of this writing.\n\u201cBroken promises\u201d and unpaid bills: Law firm representing Chetrit seeks to withdraw from case\nAttorney Elliott Joffe accused the Chetrits of non-cooperation, providing unreliable info and unpaid legal bills and is seeking to withdraw from representing Meyer Chetrit. The developer is battling a $132 million judgement owed to an entity of Maverick Real Estate Partners after a foreclosure case, as well as criminal charges of tenant harassment.\nJudge awards $22M to JLL over Moshe Silber\u2019s mortgage fraud\nMoshe Silber and his business partner, Fred Schulman, were ordered to pay $21.7 million in restitution to their lender, JLL. The pair pleaded guilty more than a year ago to a\nmortgage fraud scheme\nin which they obtained an inflated loan for a 976-unit rental property in Cincinnati.\nHousing whirlwind: Mamdani wastes no time targeting \u201cbad landlords\u201d\nMamdani began his term targeting \u201cbad landlords,\u201d including naming tenant advocate Cea Weaver as director of the relaunched Office to Protect Tenants. The city is also hosting \u201cRental Ripoff\u201d hearings for tenants to voice grievances and help shape future policy\n",

        "content": "So many crazy things are happening in real estate and politics. President Donald Trump and Gov. Kathy Hochul are adopting each other\u2019s ideas. Mayor Zohran Mamdani made a striking admission about rent-stabilized buildings. And Cea Weaver, tenant activist and newly appointed Mamdani official, is apologizing for her long-held beliefs.\nLet\u2019s start with Mamdani. His legal brief on the\nPinnacle portfolio bankruptcy\nasserted that even at the mere $88,000 per unit offered by Summit Properties USA, the price would be too high.\nThis is the same man who claimed throughout his campaign that owners of rent-stabilized housing were profiting handsomely. Now Mamdani is now declaring that rent-stabilized housing has been rendered\nvirtually worthless\n.\nHe\u2019s also saying it\nshould\nbe nearly worthless so that owners cannot borrow against it, freeing up money for operating expenses and repairs rather than mortgage payments.\nCommenters on social media pounced. Some said the city\u2019s legal filing should be presented to the Supreme Court as evidence that rent stabilization is\na taking\nof private property \u2014 and thus unconstitutional.\nSummit\u2019s offer is actually higher than other rent-stabilized portfolios are asking. One industry PR veteran told me he can\u2019t wrap his brain around the fact that in New York City it costs $800,000 to build an affordable unit but\nonly $69,000\nto buy one.\n\u201cThe delta between the cost and value of the affordable units is striking,\u201d he emailed. \u201cI\u2019m no economist, but when a commodity is worth 1/10th of what it costs to produce, I think there is a problem.\u201d\nAlso striking: Tenant activist Weaver was forced to say her past tweets that private property should be seized and that homeownership is a tool of white supremacy were \u201c\nregretful\n\u201d and \u201cnot something I would say today.\u201d\nWeaver, 37, has been consistent in\nthese opinions\nfor years. Suddenly she finds them regretful? What she really regrets is having to walk them back. Swallowing your pride is the price of being inside City Hall rather than protesting on its steps.\nMaking Weaver apologize is another sign that Mamdani is\nmoving away from radicalism\nin order to govern. Meanwhile in Washington, Trump\u2019s aides seem to do the opposite \u2014 abandoning\nmainstream opinions\nthey\nonce held\nin favor of provocative statements to please the boss and the base.\nSpeaking of Trump, you know we\u2019re in strange times when he and Hochul are adopting each other\u2019s ideas. And not good ideas, either.\nTrump on Wednesday\ncalled for a ban\non institutional investors\u2019 buying single-family homes, something\nHochul did last year\n\u2014 with cowardly state legislators joining in.\nMy\ncolumn\nabout Hochul\u2019s proposal had a very subtle headline: \u201cWhy Hochul\u2019s crackdown on real estate investors makes absolutely no sense.\u201d\nInstitutional investors are a small fraction of the market and don\u2019t get into bidding wars for homes. They rent houses to people who can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to own. They own\nless than 1 percent\nof single-family homes and\n3 or 4 percent\nof single-family rentals. They account for\n0.5 percent\nto\n2 percent\nof single-family purchases. For\nsix consecutive quarters\nthey have sold more homes than they\u2019ve bought.\nTrump\u2019s bomb-drop on homebuying came just six days after Hochul proposed \u201c\nno tax on tips\n,\u201d matching a Trump campaign proposal that Congress put into the Big Beautiful Bill.\nOne is a real estate policy and the other is about taxes, but they are similar in that they aim to fool voters, not to be effective policy.\nTrump\u2019s \u201cno tax on tips\u201d sounds progressive because tipped workers are not high earners. But it applies to just 2 percent of workers. What about the other 98 percent? Why do restaurants\u2019 servers but not kitchen staff deserve a tax break?\nAbout 37 percent of tipped workers don\u2019t even make enough money to pay federal income taxes, so Trump\u2019s policy doesn\u2019t save them anything. But their tips are still subject to payroll taxes.\nHochul\u2019s tips proposal seems like a preemptive move to ensure that her Republican challenger, Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, cannot adopt it for his own campaign.\nIf the first week of 2026 is any indication, it\u2019s going to be a wild year.\n",

        "content": "This year has started off with bad news for Chicago commercial real estate, as a battle over botched lab space deals is underway.\nChicago-based\nPortal Innovations filed suit against Boston-based Beacon Capital Partners\n, a major office landlord accused of failing to meet funding commitments tied to several of Portal\u2019s shared lab space ventures, including sites in Fulton Market, Houston, Boston and Atlanta.\nThe dispute centers on missed capital calls that Portal says could leave it unable to meet obligations on leases it signed with Beacon\u2019s financial backing.\nBeacon\npushed back, saying the outstanding capital call was less than $1 million and that it has already sunk tens of millions into Portal-backed buildouts.\nTheir drama drags the life sciences real estate mess squarely into Chicago \u2014 a market that, until now, had largely sidestepped the turmoil hammering San Diego, Boston and the Bay Area.\nAnd it\u2019s not just Portal. The company\u2019s model of flexible, fully built lab space for early-stage biotech startups draws comparisons to\nWeWork\u2019s\nill-fated coworking empire. Shared lab space is a capital-intensive business, especially when tenants can\u2019t scale. Chicago already saw one version collapse when\nBioLabs was evicted\nfrom a Sterling Bay-owned Lincoln Park property last year. That 125,000-square-foot property is about to be sold to\nDallas-based Altera Fund Advisors\n, likely at a substantial discount from Sterling\u2019s $64 million mortgage debt. The buyer plans to convert it from lab-oriented into outpatient medical offices.\nMeanwhile, national cracks in the sector continue to spread. In San Diego,\nBank OZK this week sold off a $265 million loan note\non a life sciences project also built by Chicago-based Sterling Bay to Strategic Value Partners. But that\u2019s only part of OZK\u2019s exposure to San Diego\u2019s struggling new development market for labs.\nThe bank also holds a $915 million loan on a 1.6 million-square-foot waterfront life sciences and office campus built by\nIQHQ\n\u2014 a six-block life sciences and office project that remains largely vacant. By the estimate of\nRebel Cole\n, a finance professor who has been outspoken about the risk within Bank OZK\u2019s loan book, the project could be worth as little as $500 million, nearly half the debt balance, depending on market rent assumptions and lease-up prospects.\nOf course, the\nsole building Sterling Bay completed\nat its famously stalled megadevelopment\nLincoln Yards\n, a 285,000-square-foot lab structure, is also still fully vacant and served as a warning the life sciences slowdown would hit Chicago. Bank OZK also extended more than $50 million in debt for Sterling Bay to build that project, and it\u2019s now being shopped with pricing expectations to come in below the loan balance.\nIt\u2019s a stark\nreversal from 2021\n, when life sciences was the darling of institutional investors. More than $10 billion poured into the sector that year as investors chased lab space insulated from the pandemic\u2019s office headwinds.\nTaconic Partners\n, for one, plowed $2 billion into New York projects aiming to corner the sector. Now, the firm\u2019s plans are largely frozen.\nThe latest life sciences report by CBRE painted a sluggish picture: the sector\u2019s vacancy rose to more than 23 percent across the U.S., though the 0.8 percent increase marked the smallest since late 2022. There\u2019s little clarity on when absorption will return.\nOnce thought immune to remote work trends, life sciences real estate is proving just as vulnerable to overbuilding, interest rates and shifting capital flows as any other asset class. Now, Chicago is experiencing the fallout.\n",

        "content": "The safest kind of bet is one you already know the outcome of. It\u2019s the perfect kind of bet for a guy on the sidelines, like, for example, Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson.\nOn the same day telecoms giant\nAT&amp;T dropped its bomb\non Downtown Dallas via news of its plans to relocate to Plano, Johnson was\ntalking to\nthe New York Post about Zohran Mamdani\u2019s inauguration.\n\u201cWhat was already a trickle is going to turn into a flood of individuals and companies who have called New York home for a long time, moving to Dallas,\u201d he told the outlet.\nThat\u2019s some impressive reading of the tea leaves. One wonders what gave him the idea. Maybe the half-built campuses for the world\u2019s biggest banks rising in his backyard clued him in.\nIt\u2019s 2026. We\u2019re about 15 years into the rise of North Texas as a corporate relo destination \u2014 so many years into the trend that\nit\u2019s started dwindling\n.\nMeanwhile,\nthe urban core\nof the city that elected Johnson was dealt a catastrophic blow on Monday. AT&amp;T announced plans to build a new campus in Plano, leaving a 2 million-square-foot hole in Downtown Dallas\u2019 already struggling office market as soon as late 2028. Before the announcement, vacancy rates in the urban core were averaging 33 percent, according to Partners Real Estate.\nGov. Greg Abbott didn\u2019t name Johnson, but seemed to take aim at the mayor when discussing who should shoulder the blame for the catastrophic move: \u201cLocal leaders, it\u2019s their responsibility to ensure that homeless people are not endangering their citizens,\u201d Abbott\nsaid\nat a campaign event in Fort Worth.\nThe same day, the future of Neiman Marcus\u2019 downtown flagship store got murkier.\nSaks Global CEO Marc Metrick stepped down\nas rumors swirled about a potential upcoming bankruptcy filing.\nIn early 2025, Saks announced plans to close the landmark store at 1618 Main Street, then repeatedly delayed the move after pushback from city leaders, stating it would remain open beyond the 2025 holiday season as talks continued with the city on a potential reimagining of the nine-story historic property.\nA third grenade hit Downtown Dallas last week when Todd Interests\u2019 Shawn Todd\ntold\nthe Dallas Morning News he\u2019s handing back the keys to The National, the skyscraper he spent $460 million converting into a mixed-use project. Starwood Capital Group is foreclosing on the property after providing a $230 million refi loan in 2023.\nThe building at 1401 Elm Street is one of the largest office conversion projects in the country, a poster child for adaptive reuse as a method of breathing new life into crumbling downtown office districts. Todd secured $150 million in state and local incentives to complete the ambitious project, which opened in TK.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been committed to downtown,\u201d Todd said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been committed for 20 years. In 35 years, our firm has never lost money \u2014 this is the first year that it\u2019s happened.\u201d\nThe smartest syndicator in the room\nThe world of real estate syndication has a reputation. Operators are seen as unsophisticated and inexperienced, treating real estate investment like social media influencing.\nJon Venetos seemed different\n. The Lurin Capital founder came up in prestigious hedge funds before pivoting to real estate, but he ended up meeting the same fate as his peers in the space. Since the spring of 2025, he\u2019s faced a crush of default lawsuits, foreclosures and receivership appointments; he\u2019s also fighting allegations of fraud from lenders and former employees.\nNew year, same distress\nWhen it seems like there\u2019s nothing left for\nTides Equities\nto lose, the embattled syndicator gets hit with another foreclosure notice. This time, the firm owned by Sean Kia and Ryan Andrade could lose Tides at Highland Meadows, a 650-unit apartment complex at 11330 Amanda Lane in Dallas. The $76.4 million loan tied to the property is a chunk of the\n$826 million in troubled CRE debt\nthat were flagged for foreclosure auction this month, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service. The number represents a dip from\nDecember\u2019s high of $911 million\nin debt headed to auction, but it\u2019s still far above prior months when the value of debt flagged for foreclosure hovered around $600 million.\nRiver Oaks dominates in Houston\u2019s top luxury deals\nOf the\n10 most expensive homes\nsold in Harris County in 2025, five were within one square mile of each other in Houston\u2019s River Oaks neighborhood. The gates estate at 2110 River Oaks Boulevard topped the list. It\u2019s one of the 31 River Oaks homes designed by legendary architect John Staub between 1924 and 1958. It was last listed for $18.9 million, about $2,000 per square foot. Compass Real Estate agent Laura Sweeney represented the buyer and seller.\nGoogle turns on at Austin\u2019s Sail Tower\nAt long last,\nGoogle has moved\ninto Austin\u2019s 35-story, 804,000-square-foot Sail Tower after signing a full-building lease at the building in 2019. The tower, at 601 West Second Street in Downtown Austin, had been conspicuously vacant since its completion in 2022, a situation estimated to have cost Google about $53 million annually in rent. Despite having a full-building lease, Google is marketing the top six floors for sublease, with Digital Realty Trust identified as a potential subtenant.",

        "content": "Housing isn\u2019t the only marquee issue for San Franciscans, but it does lead a litany of challenges that includes an office vacancy rate above 30 percent despite gains from the still blossoming artificial intelligence industry, slow construction permitting and the general vibe of an increasingly pugnacious Trump administration.\nAll of that, and more, arose on Wednesday, as the three major candidates vying to replace Rep. Nancy Pelosi as San Francisco\u2019s voice in Washington D.C. gathered before a packed auditorium and tried to convince voters of their vision for the city.\nStill, when asked for the most pressing issue, state Sen. Scott Wiener,\nthe race\u2019s most high-profile candidate\n, immediately pointed to housing. Indeed, over the course of the evening, Wiener, San Francisco Supervisor Connie Chan, and Saikat Chakrabarti, who formerly worked as chief of staff for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, laid out their competing proposals to address the city\u2019s housing shortage\nLittle wonder in San Francisco, a city\nmandated to permit 82,000 new housing units by 2031\n.\nCould the feds help?\n\u201cThe federal government used to play a huge role in housing in this country,\u201d said Wiener, who, since arriving at the legislature in 2017, has authored some of the most ambitious housing bills in California\u2019s history. \u201cWe need massive investment in affordable housing, in social housing, mixed-income social housing in this country.\u201d\nWiener called for providing incentives for cities to more rapidly permit construction so as to keep federal grants and loans from getting bogged down in bureaucracy. He also said he would prioritize modernizing the construction industry, and stabilizing the local skilled workforce.\nChakrabarti said the city\u2019s efforts to rezone neighborhoods and speed up permitting, while good on paper, has failed to actually produce housing. He talked about bringing back the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, a New Deal agency from the 1930s that provided low-interest loans to developers and stockpiled steel and lumber to insulate the effect of inflation on critical construction materials. Chakrabarti also said he wanted to repeal the Faircloth Amendment, part of the 1998 federal bill that restricts new social housing construction.\nChan, a progressive\nwho many see as a foil to Wiener\u2019s build-build-build and upzone ethos\n, agreed that the city needs to build more housing but argued it was already happening. She said the city needed land and money in order to deliver \u201ctrue, real housing,\u201d and not just luxury condos for the wealthy.\n\u201cOne of the best ways to actually solve homelessness is to make sure that people can actually stay housed, and that means to preserve the existing housing that we have today, including rent controlled units,\u201d Chan said. \u201cIt\u2019s the most affordable and most valuable housing that we have in our city, and we must preserve them.\u201d\nA day after the candidate\u2019s forum, the San Francisco Chronicle reported what many in the city had been expecting:\nMayor Daniel Lurie\u2019s so-called Family Zoning Plan\n, passed late last year by the city\u2019s board of supervisors, would face a legal challenge. The plan, which upzoned parts of the city that haven\u2019t added additional housing stock in decades, was set to go into effect Monday, but may be paused due to the litigation. The lawsuit, filed by San Francisco Neighborhoods United and Small Business Forward, attempts to compel the city to further study the plan\u2019s impact on city infrastructure, historic resources, and at-risk communities before it goes into effect.\nWhile Lurie\u2019s housing solution faces a snag, one of the city\u2019s most embattled development sites may finally get unlocked. The Oceanwide Center, a two-tower proposal that broke ground in 2021 and was supposed to produce the city\u2019s second tallest skyscraper behind the Salesforce Tower, has sat abandoned for years. Now, the project\u2019s China-based lender, Haitong International Equity Investment Management, has taken control of the property and expects to put it to auction on January 15. The San Francisco Business Times is reporting that the San Francisco Recovery Fund \u2014 a new venture from long-time local developer Dan Kingsley and his business partner, Jay Yang \u2014 is\npoised to purchase the property for $100 million\n. The fund put down a\nnonrefundable deposit on the property in December.\nYang declined\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nrequest for comment, saying only that his fund was in the process of closing on the purchase.\n",

        "content": "One year later and people are mad as hell.\nOpen up a news story from this past Wednesday, the one-year anniversary of the Palisades and Eaton fires, and the answer to what, precisely, they\u2019re made about is muddled.\nBloomberg\nasked its newsletter subscribers \u201cWhat\u2019s holding LA back?\u201d before trying to peg a decline in property values to climate change and a cooling of investor sentiment, along with $33.9 billion in federal disaster aid being held hostage as possible answers. The\nNew York Post\n,\u00a0 true to form, characterized the Palisades as a \u201cwasteland.\u201d\nThe Wall Street Journal\nstruck a balance calling the recovery \u201cslow and uneven,\u201d driven by factors such as wealth and red tape reduction.\nThe lookbacks on everything from the handling of the fires\u2019 containments to insurance and rebuilding costs have flowed freely. It was solutions and calls for accountability that were sought at a hard-hitting demonstration under the banner of \u201cThey Let Us Burn,\u201d held on the January 7 anniversary of the infernos. The rally shut down Antioch Street and Swarthmore Avenue in the Palisades, with a crowd of several hundred gathered on the streets, some standing on top of the CVS building to listen for next steps. For some, that involves litigation. For others, it\u2019s calling for policy reform. Still others \u2014 more specifically former reality TV star Spencer Pratt, who announced his bid for mayor at the protest \u2014 want to shake up Los Angeles City Hall.\nNourmand &amp; Associates\u2019 Rochelle Atlas Maize, while not a speaker at the rally, was in attendance, reflecting an interest in the circumstances of multiple clients still dealing with the aftermath of the fires and \u201ceffectively frozen\u201d from moving forward. She pointed to long-term problems that have been building well before last year\u2019s wildfires, including permit fees, Measure United to House L.A. (ULA), construction costs and delays. Atlas Maize said policy makers should stop looking at those items in isolation and instead see their points of connection to figure out a way forward.\n\u201cWe cannot keep rebuilding communities without reforming how insurance, permitting and infrastructure planning work together,\u201d she told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cHomeowners need guidance, predictability and protection \u2014 not just during the rebuild, but permanently. If we don\u2019t fix that, this will repeat itself again and again.\u201d\nResi brokerage change afoot?\nSpeaking of the need for change, that\u2019s exactly what former Compass California president Mark McLaughlin told\nsubscribers\nin a Friday newsletter weighing in on the\nCompass-Anywhere deal\nclosing.\nThe deal included $1.6 billion in stock and Compass buying Anywhere\u2019s $2.6 billion in debt for a combined value of $4.2 billion. The headcount of the merged entity is some 340,000 agents.\nMcLaughlin\u2019s served as Compass California president between September 2018 and December 2020. He bounced back to the firm in 2023 as chief real estate strategist. After that two-year contract ended, the executive moved to a\npart-time mergers and acquisitions advisory role\nat the brokerage.\nMcLaughlin suggested to his followers the Compass-Anywhere combination has the leverage to reframe who serves who in the ecosystem of MLSs and agents. From McLaughlin\u2019s view, the short answer is portals need to \u201clisten and, in turn, shape a compelling offering\u201d for their customers.\n\u201cOur industry has been too tolerant of demands, constrictive rules and, in some instances, fines,\u201d McLaughlin said in his newsletter.\nTime will tell if a power shift is realized.\nCorona del Mar movement\nChange is also happening in coastal Orange County.\nThe Agency poached\nJohn Stanaland and his six-person team\nfrom Douglas Elliman, while also bringing on Craig Knizek as managing director in its Corona del Mar office.\nThe Agency co-founder Mauricio Umansky called Orange County a \u201ccornerstone market\u201d for the brokerage and said the latest additions are aimed at \u201clong-term impact\u201d regionally.\nThe office additions bring its headcount to 55 \u2014 a sizable operation that backs what Umansky\u2019s saying in a market that not all L.A.-based firms have broken into for various reasons.\nEven still, some Los Angeles brokerages have made their plays into the coastal enclave. That includes Douglas Elliman\u2019s Altman Brothers Team and the Oppenheim Group. Both have offices in Corona del Mar. Carolwood Estates entered Newport Beach through what is now a former affiliation with the Caruso Group (no relation to developer Rick Caruso).\nRemembering Sandra Miller\nMany have been spending recent weeks in remembrance of\nSandra Miller\n, the founder of Engel &amp; V\u00f6lkers Santa Monica.\nThe brokerage confirmed this past week Miller\u2019s passing during the holidays.\nOne word that has been repeatedly used by her colleagues to describe Miller: powerhouse.\nShe was the first California licensee to bring the German-based brokerage to the state and was also heavily involved in the industry. She had a seat on the California Association of Realtors Board of Directors and also held several leadership positions with the National Association of Realtors and Greater Los Angeles Association of Realtors.\nMiller\u2019s legacy in Santa Monica and beyond will continue with the office now being helmed by her son Steven Walter and brokerage manager Raymond Dominguez.\n",

        "content": "Kilroy Realty has made another move to reshape its portfolio, shedding another not-so-occupied property as the company faces a wave of\nlease expirations\n.\nThe deal for the Sunset Media Center looks like a discount for joint venture Hankey Investment Company \u2014 owned by billionaire Don Hankey, who put up President Donald Trump\u2019s $175 million bond in his New York civil fraud case \u2014 and\nBarker Pacific Group.\nThe new owners paid $61 million for the 22-story, 326,000 square foot office, which comes to about $187 a square foot, with a Measure ULA tax bill of $3.6 million, according to property records. Located at 6255 West Sunset Boulevard in the heart of Hollywood \u2014 about two blocks from the Walk of Fame \u2014 the property is 51 percent occupied.\nHankey funded the debt for the purchase but amount was not disclosed; per the deed of trust, it is a $42 million note.\nKilroy\u2019s Los Angeles portfolio encompassed 53 properties, more than 4.5 million square feet of rentable space, and was 74 percent occupied, as of the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2025. In Los Angeles, 42 leases that amount to 507,000 square feet, or about 4 percent of its leased space, are set to expire this year.\nKilroy sold a Santa Monica office building that was only 65 percent occupied last July. Then the real estate investment trust purchased Maple Plaza, a Beverly Hills office campus that was 75 percent leased at the time and marked the company\u2019s entry to the wealthy enclave \u2014 and may have given chief executive Angela Aman one of her better earnings call talking points since she took the corner office. Maple Plaza, she said on a third-quarter earnings call, had \u201cbecome the strongest driver of leasing activity in our Los Angeles portfolio.\u201d\nThe latest sale took Kilroy back to trimming inventory \u2014 and time will tell which way the REIT will lean on deals in 2026.\nCalendar item\nSpeaking of 2026 \u2026 Happy New Year! You know what that means? Earnings season, annual reports and proxies. Time to see how Los Angeles\u2019 publicly traded commercial real estate companies fared, and how much they\npaid\ntheir executives. Stay tuned.\nGood news out of the Valley\nIn Oct. 2025,\nThe Real Deal\nwrote\nthe Encino Financial Center, a 13-story office building owned by Lowe Enterprises, received an appraisal that reduced its value by almost a third. That was after its loan landed in special servicing due to imminent monetary default. The nearly 230,000-square-foot office building at 16133 Ventura Boulevard is still valued at about $49 million compared to $72 million at loan issuance in February 2015, which is more than the $39 million debt connected to the property.\nBut a loan modification was closed, and the note was extended to Nov. 2026, according to Morningstar, which buys Lowe more time. The borrower funded $2.5 million in new capital as part of the modification terms, per Morningstar. And, the three largest tenants, all of which had lease expirations next year, have extended their leases.\nEl Segundo trade\nDowntown Los Angeles offices are still bumping along bottom, and even discounted deals are commanding pricier amounts on a per square foot basis in submarkets beyond the city\u2019s center.\u00a0 Take Majestic Asset Management and AVG Partners\u2019 recent El Segundo\nbuy\n. The three-story office building traded hands for $121.5 million, or about $405 a square foot.\nThat is less than the $170 million, or about $560 per square foot, Ocean West Capital Partners and Lionstone Investments purchased the real estate at 777 South Aviation Boulevard for pre-pandemic. But it is more per square foot, than the priciest office\ntrade\nlast year: Uncommon Developers\u2019 purchase of a Brookfield-owned downtown skyscraper for $210 million, or $201 a square foot.\nEl Segundo\u2019s office sector is nowhere near as distressed as downtown\u2019s, but isn\u2019t as\nprosperous\nas Century City\u2019s either.\nBlackstone checks out\nBlackstone\nditched\nan extended-stay, Marriott-branded hotel in Torrance, near Redondo Beach, for about $54 million, or roughly $218,000 per key. The buyer of the Residence Inn at 3701 Torrance Boulevard is Capital Insight.\nOn a per room basis, in Los Angeles County, it isn\u2019t as distressed as it could be, but still reflects an ongoing hospitality rut. It\u2019s more than lender Corten Real Estate Partners\u2019\npurchase\n, via auction, of the Line in Koreatown for $68 million, or $177,000 a room \u2014 but less than Pebblebrook Hotel Trust\u2019s sale of the Montrose in West Hollywood for roughly $44 million, or about $333,000 a room.\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s a new year, but in Surfside, the arguments sound familiar.\nA recently proposed Live Local Act project is stirring local opposition, even as state lawmakers look to double-down on the pro-development workforce housing law that has\nriled up residents\nand local governments across the state.\nA pair of developers submitted plans in November for an 11-story, 33-unit residential and hotel project on 95th Street in Surfside. An affiliate of the site owner, New York-based Postal Realty Trust led by Andrew Spodek, and an entity called Ocean Walk Surfside LLC, filed the application.\nThe building would replace a single-story pink post office that was built in the 1950s.\nSurfside Mayor Charles Burkett called it a \u201cdisaster.\u201d Burkett went further. He said it\u2019s outrageous that Florida politicians have \u201cdecided to destroy the fabric and composition of small towns\u201d via the Live Local Act.\nLive Local became law in 2023. It encourages the development of workforce housing, limited to tenants earning a maximum of 120 percent of the area median income, by giving developers density, height, parking and tax incentives, among other things.\nThe law has stripped cities of their approval power. If developers comply with the requirements of the law, they can bypass public hearings to obtain approvals administratively.\nThe law has also riled up a number of towns and their residents.\nAside from concerns over additional strain on already congested roads, opponents of the project cited potential issues with crowded schools, and an erosion of the town\u2019s right to determine its development fate.\nTown staff members are reviewing the application.\nLawmakers in Tallahassee will likely be unphased, as they have been in years past, by calls to return power to municipalities or help control overdevelopment.\nAmong the real estate bills that could be considered this legislative session is Senate Bill 1548, which was filed late last week by Sen. Alexis Calatayud. The bill expands the properties that qualify for Live Local to include any property owned by a county, municipality or school district. In those cases, the property owner would have to be a party to the application and those projects must be within the geographical boundaries of their respective county, municipality or school district.\nCounties would also be barred from restricting height of Live Local Act projects through other means \u2014 i.e. setbacks or stepbacks.\nThe bill has some other quirks. Farms and farm operations are not considered commercial or industrial properties.\nKeep an eye for our additional reporting on this and other real estate-related bills the legislature could take up this session, which starts on Monday.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nDo you expect more of a crackdown on Venezuelan investment in South Florida following Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s capture and arrest, or the opposite? Are your Venezuelan clients listing their U.S. properties for sale? Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential:\nThe mansion at 1460 North Lake Way in Palm Beach changed hands for $72 million. British investor\nPamela W. Starret\nsold the nearly 1-acre property to a hidden buyer. The roughly 16,000-square-foot house has six bedrooms, six full bathrooms and three half baths.\nCommercial\n: In Coral Gables, DWS Group sold\nthe Alhambra\n, a two-building office complex at 2 Alhambra Plaza and 95 Merrick Way for $119.6 million. Dallas-based Lone Star Funds, Jay Caplin\u2019s Miami-based Square2 Capital and David Moret\u2019s Highline Real Estate Capital bought the property.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nA waterfront estate in Palm Beach hit the market\nfor $105 million\n. The seven-bedroom, nine-bathroom compound sits on an acre at 790 South County Road. It\u2019s on the market with Christian Angle of Christian Angle Real Estate. The Maurice Fatio-designed Mediterranean home spans more than 17,000 square feet, including outdoor space, and it includes a carriage house, four-car garage, library, gym, dining room that sits 30 people, a pool and dock. Property records show it sold for about\n$31 million in 2021\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\nBillionaire and Google co-founder Larry Page is the mystery buyer who purchased two waterfront properties in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove for a combined $173 million. Fellow Google co-founder Sergey Brin also made an offer to buy a waterfront home on Allison Island in Miami Beach for about $50 million \u2014\nrecord deals\nthat represent the tiniest fraction of their combined net worths.\nElsewhere in\nFlorida\nMiami\nThe Miami Hurricanes will be\nplaying for the championship\nafter beating Ole Miss at the Fiesta Bowl last week. Miami will play for its first national championship since the 2001 season, and they\u2019ll do it on their home turf at Steve Ross\u2019 Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens. (Also on that note, Ross fired former Miami Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel. I\u2019ll miss the\nmemes\n.)\nThe Miami Police Department\u2019s Internal Affairs is investigating former Mayor Francis Suarez\u2019s gifting Rolex watches to four police sergeants-at-arms at the end of his tenure as mayor, the\nMiami New Times\nreports.\nA Coral Gables man pleaded guilty to careless boating in the Biscayne Bay death of 15-year-old Ella Adler, the daughter of Miami developer Matthew Adler, after running over the teen as she was wakeboarding behind a yacht. Under the plea deal, the boater will serve probation and avoid a formal conviction. Adler addressed the court and called for stricter boating regulations, the\nMiami Herald\nreports.",

        "content": "Jack McGinley knew he was going to lose the lawsuit over his Gold Coast Chicago mansion.\nThat\u2019s according to texts sent by his broker, as the former pharmaceutical executive and his wife, Julie McGinley, faced a lawsuit over their decision to back out of a $7.4 million deal to sell their home, days before it was set to close in May. The McGinleys reached a settlement in December with the buyers, Jason and Courtney Kuhn, who took them to court last year to enforce the sale. The terms of the agreement are not public in court records.\nIn texts surfaced in court filings, the McGinleys\u2019 broker, Jameson Sotheby\u2019s\nTim Salm\n, said Jack McGinley knew that he would eventually lose the lawsuit, but the litigation would give him time to stay there.\n\u201cJack said the litigators said it will take 2-3 years for them to win, and he\u2019s 78 and will give him that time to live in the house which is worth it,\u201d Salm wrote in a text message to the lawyer who worked with the McGinleys on the sale.\nIn another text, Salm said the buyers will \u201cwin the lawsuit and ultimately get the house. He knows it.\u201d Salm did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe lawsuit centered on the botched deal over the 9,000-square-foot home at 1336 North State Parkway, which fell apart after Julie McGinley grew more and more uncertain with the decision to sell the house, according to deposition testimony from the McGinleys.\nIt\u2019s not the first time the McGinleys were accused of treating contracts as optional. The Harold B. Smith Foundation is suing the McGinleys for canceling a $37.5 million offer to buy\nAloha Lodge\nin Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.\nAccording to that lawsuit, the McGinleys canceled a pending contract to buy a Palm Beach, Florida home from the same foundation just a few days before the agreed-upon closing date in 2023. In a separate incident with different sellers, according to the foundation\u2019s complaint, the McGinleys pulled out of a contract to buy a Lake Geneva home before closing. The couple entered into a contract to buy the same property two years later, then terminated it again, prompting a Wisconsin lawsuit in 2020, according to the foundation\u2019s complaint.\nThe Harold B. Smith Foundation said in the filing the McGinleys have a \u201cpattern of signing binding contracts and then not closing the transactions.\u201d\nBeyond the\nGold Coast\nhome,\nthe McGinleys\nown houses in Lake Forest; Santa Ynez, California, and South Dartmouth, Massachusetts, according to court documents.\nThe McGinleys, Courtney Kuhn, and their attorneys did not respond to requests for comment.\nSince the terms of the settlement are private, it\u2019s not clear if the McGinleys ended up handing over the Gold Coast property to the Kuhns. No property record showing the transfer of the property is available. However, in September, when the suit was ongoing, a record was filed indicating the McGinleys paid off a $6 million mortgage they had taken out on the house in 2020.\nThe signature\nDuring negotiations over the Gold Coast house, the McGinleys\u2019 lawyer, Julie Moltz-Matgous, requested an extension to the original contract that allowed the McGinleys to pull out of the deal by May 21. The original contract, signed March 22, had a 14-day window for either party to cancel. In response, the Kuhns requested that the change allow either party to cancel the contract by the new date.\nMoltz-Matgous sent a subsequent letter denying that request and withdrawing the request to change the contract. But on May 21, after the deadline to cancel the contract, Moltz-Matgous sent a letter to the Kuhns\u2019 attorney notifying them that the closing, which was scheduled for June 2, was canceled.\nTo back up their legal right to cancel the contract, the McGinleys argued in court that Jack McGinley, who signed the contract, was not authorized to make decisions for JJR Holdings, the LLC that owned the home. The sole member of JJR Holdings is JCM Trust, and the McGinleys argued Julie McGinley was the only beneficiary of that trust.\nBut the plaintiffs produced a 2013 document in discovery that lists Jack McGinley as a trustee of JCM Trust. The McGinleys argued that joint ownership was only temporary, and the trust was transferred back to Julie McGinley later. In a court filing, the McGinleys\u2019 attorneys pointed to Secretary of State records that show Julie McGinley is the \u201csole member\u201d of JCM Trust.\nThe plaintiffs argued that Jack McGinley had previously signed documents for JJR Holdings, and even if he technically lacked authority to sign, the contract was still valid because Julie McGinley agreed through her conduct. They noted that she allowed inspections to occur, permitted her attorney to negotiate contract modifications and accepted the earnest money deposit without objection, thereby validating the contract after the fact.\nSeller\u2019s remorse\nThe McGinleys\u2019 deposition testimony paints Jack McGinley as the hard-driving dealmaker and Julie McGinley as a reluctant participant who had never fully agreed to the sale.\nJack McGinley said when the Kuhns\u2019 offer came in, Julie McGinley wasn\u2019t happy with the offer. Jack McGinley said he told his wife \u201cwe can always get out\u201d and pushed her to move forward with the deal, according to court documents.\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve done with every property we own, I coerced, I pushed,\u201d Jack McGinley said. \u201cI usually get my way, so I drove hard to get this deal done.\u201d\nJulie McGinley said she was never on board, and wanted to sell the house for a higher price. The McGinleys paid $7.1 million for the house in 2013, property records show, and she said in her testimony they had made close to $4 million in renovations. But she said she never told her broker or attorney that she objected to his signature on the contract, according to court documents.\n\u201cI won\u2019t say I went along with it. I disagreed with it vehemently,\u201d she said in deposition testimony. \u201dI just knew the deal wasn\u2019t done, and I was trying to convince him we\u2019re getting out of this.\u201d\nJack McGinley said in the deposition he told Moltz-Matgous to cancel the contract after a conversation with his wife where she refused to sell the house.\n\u201cShe was the most upset I\u2019ve ever seen her,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I thought up until that point I could convince her to sell the property.\u201d\n",

        "content": "As Chicago\u2019s industrial sector stabilizes following a\npandemic-era boom of activity\n, data centers are propping up the market, year-end data from Savills shows.\nDuring each of the first three quarters of 2025, less than 10 million square feet of industrial space was under construction in the Chicago area, according to Savills\u2019 report. But during the fourth quarter, that number began to tick up again and landed at 13 million square feet, driven mostly by incoming data center developments.\nThose numbers are still far below the construction activity seen during the peak of the pandemic. In the last quarter of 2022, nearly 40 million square feet of industrial space was under construction in the Chicago area, according to Savills.\nAs work-from-home policies caused office demand to plummet, industrial development became a safe haven for investors. Chicago is particularly well-suited to such projects because of its\nextensive rail network and access to freshwater\n.\nStill, that level of activity has tapered off in recent years since the pandemic.\nIndustrial asking rents rose 2.1 percent in 2025, year-over-year, to $7.94 per square foot, but with concessions factored in, net effective rent stayed roughly the same compared to 2024 in much of the Chicago area.\nNet absorption improved significantly last year, indicating that the region\u2019s supply is doing a better job matching demand from tenants. By the end of 2024, about 400,000 more square feet of space was leased than vacated. In the last quarter of 2025, that figure jumped up to 7.3 million square feet.\nBuyers are still interested in the market too. The highest dollar sale in Cook County last year was\nNorthPoint Development\u2019s purchase of a $270 million industrial portfolio\nin the Northwest suburbs to NorthPoint Development,\na TRD data analysis found\n. The seller was Massachusetts-based seller High Street Logistics.\nIt was the only sale that came in over $200 million last year.",

        "content": "Three Soho storefronts have changed hands.\nDeclaration Partners Real Estate and Hilltop Real Estate have inked a deal for the master lease at three Soho storefronts. The firms will control 113-121 Prince Street for 25 years in exchange for a little over $50 million, according to city records. The lease also gives the option to extend to 2091.\nIt\u2019s the latest retail deal in Soho, where asking rents have picked up. The neighborhood is now the most expensive retail corridor south of Times Square, according to a\n2025 report\nfrom the Real Estate Board of New York.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no availability in Soho right now and there\u2019s still a ton of tenants who want to be there,\u201d said Jeffrey Kohn, founder of Hilltop.\nAsking rents on Broadway between Houston and Broome are still significantly less than they were at their peak in 2015. But at a median of $604 per square foot, they\u2019ve basically doubled from their pandemic lows in 2021. Asking rents on that strip rose more than 26 percent between 2024 and 2025, according to REBNY. (The storefronts on Prince Street are about two blocks west of Broadway.)\nThat\u2019s not the same for every neighborhood. Herald Square, for instance, has not seen the same level of retailer interest. Median asking rents on West 34th Street between Fifth and Seventh Avenues are only $447 per square foot.\nSoho has stood out in part for its visuals, Kohn said. Last year, apparel brand Ralph Lauren paid $132 million to buy its retail condo next door to the new acquisition, at 109 Prince Street.\nThe storefronts at 113-121 Prince are currently leased to clothiers Ba&amp;sh, Sandro and Farm Rio. The units comprise about 8,250 square feet on the ground floor and 7,000 square feet of basement.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a fantastic and historically designated location for over 50 years and we think it will stand the test of time for the next 50 plus,\u201d said Todd Rich, cofounder and head of real estate at Declaration Partners.\nThe lessor was an affiliate of Soho Development Corp and Rocco Buonpane signed the memorandum of lease for the company. Buonpane did not respond to a request for comment by press time.\nDeclaration is anchored by the family investment office of David Rubenstein.",

Horton\n.\nThe\nNew York-based investor\nbought its third rental home community from D.R. Horton in six months. Financing for the three trades was arranged by Polaris Funding, according to a press release from the\nLakewood\n, New Jersey-based mortgage brokerage.\nFor this deal, Four Corners picked up The Oaks at Grand West Apartments, a built-to-rent community at 10415 Lancaster Forest Lane. The firm paid $36 million for the 290,000-square-foot, 147-unit rental home community built in 2024, according to the release. The deal works out to about $245,000 per unit.\nNate Hyman, founder of Polaris, arranged financing for the deal, a $25.2 million loan from New York-based Encore Finance Group, loan documents show.\n\u201cThis went very [smoothly] and had a closing period of under 60 days because of Polaris\u2019 relationship with the lender and the understanding we have for the BTR space,\u201d Hyman said in an email.\nHyman also arranged the financing for Four Corners\u2019 $55.2 million purchase of two built-to-rent communities in Slidell, Louisiana, totaling 248 units. The trade worked out to $222,400 per unit.\nThe Oaks at Grand West Apartments features three- and four-bedroom rental homes that range in size from 1,800 square feet to 2,000 square feet, each with laundry facilities, a two-car garage, covered patio and fenced-in backyard, according to the property\u2019s website. Shared amenities include a dog park and playground. Rents at the property start at about $2,400 per month.\nBuilt-to-rent properties, which offer some of the same perks as a single-family home, soared in popularity during the pandemic when remote work and lockdowns kept people confined to their homes.\nThese rental properties also offer an alternative to vertical living for would-be homebuyers kept on the sidelines by the highly competitive seller\u2019s market of 2020 and 2021 and then the high interest rates that have plagued the market since 2022.\nThe trend has really taken off in Texas, where nearly 22,000 built-to-rent units were in the pipeline in the beginning of 2025 \u2014 the most of any state in the country, according to a report from Point2Homes. At the city level, Phoenix led the nation,\nfollowed by Dallas\n, Atlanta and Charlotte. Houston ranked fifth, with 4,613 units under construction at the beginning of last year.\n",

That fed into a yearly total of nearly 42 million square feet, the highest for a year since 2019.\nIncreased demand resulted in tightening market conditions.

        "content": "Real estate fixer Mark Nussbaum is in a big mess and things don\u2019t seem to be getting much better.\nNussbaum acted as an attorney, a bridge lender, a deal connector and even a landlord, all while running his law firm Nussbaum Lowinger.\nNow he\u2019s staring down a $400 million hole with former clients alleging he misappropriated escrow funds. He\u2019s also facing criminal charges from Manhattan\u2019s District Attorney\u2019s office for allegedly stealing at least $15 million from escrow clients. (Nussbaum has pleaded not guilty). One lawsuit accuses Nussbaum Lowinger of running a\nPonzi scheme\nwith much of the money going to a now deceased Borough Park investor named Mendel Steiner.\nIn the past month, new court filings have revealed some of the most explosive information to date about the breadth of Nussbaum\u2019s influence in tri-state real estate, who he did business with and the difficulties that lie ahead for creditors trying to collect from Nussbaum\u2019s estate.\nWhat\u2019s Next For Nussbaum?\nThe Manhattan D.A.\u2019s criminal charges against Nussbaum are pending. At the time of the indictment in May, prosecutors mentioned only two victims, but noted that they believed there were more.\nNussbaum is out on bail. He has had two hearing dates, but both matters were adjourned. His next hearing is scheduled for March.\nThe case will rest on whether Nussbaum\u2019s former clients knew of his schemes. Nussbaum\u2019s legal team will likely argue the victims were aware that their escrow money was at risk or were clued in to Nussbaum\u2019s\n\u201cshow capital\u201d tactic\n, where Nussbaum would allegedly wire escrow funds to real estate dealmakers to show a lender that capital was secured. Were these victims, or investors?\nThe Debtors\nNussbaum filed an\nexhaustive list\nof all his creditors and debtors in December. He had over $400 million in creditors. But the more notable names were on the debtor side.\nThey included:\nSteiner, who had the largest debt at $306 million.\nBoruch Drillman, a Brooklyn investor who pleaded guilty for his role in a mortgage fraud conspiracy in 2023, owed $4.7 million.\nYanky Tauber\n, Nussbaum\u2019s deal partner on Chicago real estate, owes $1.5 million.\nOpal Holdings head\nShaya Prager\n, owed $1.1 million.\nIn civil court, Nussbaum and his former law firms Nussbaum Lowinger and Mark J Nussbaum &amp; Associates entered into an alternative to bankruptcy, known as an assignment for the benefit of creditors. He appointed a lawyer, Sheldon Eisenberger, to handle the process. The goal is to attempt to pay the people Nussbaum owes money to.\nThe process has been a slog. Eisenberger has noted the poor state of books and records kept by Nussbaum. So far, debtors who owe Nussbaum money have been reluctant to return it, except for one person.\nThe Wolf\nThe mercurial Wolf Wercberger is the only one to reach a settlement with Eisenberger.\nWercberger recently agreed to pay about $15.3 million to resolve the ABC\u2019s claims against him. According to the settlement agreement, Wercberger deposited funds in Nussbaum\u2019s escrow accounts starting in 2022. Wercberger made back all the money he put into the funds plus $16 million to $19 million in extra proceeds.\nEisenberger agreed to Wercberger\u2019s payment, citing the poor state of Nussbaum\u2019s books and records and Nussbaum\u2019s lack of credibility if the matter were to be litigated in court, according court filings as part of the ABC.\nEisenberger says that Wercberger made the payment in part to encourage others to make payments to help the ABC pay \u201cinnocent parties\u201d who had likely lost money with Nussbaum. This includes people who used Nussbaum Lowinger\u2019s escrow services to buy family residences.\n\u201cThe settlement will infuse the estate with needed capital to pay out certain categories of creditors immediately and make it more likely all creditors receive distributions,\u201d Eisenberger said in a court filing.\nIt remains unclear why Wercberger would care about helping other creditors getting paid back.\nThere is another possible motivation: The settlement, if approved by the court, could stop future claims brought by Nussbaum creditors against Wercberger.\nWercberger has been a\nprominent figure\nin the Nussbaum saga and has been sued before by another Nussbaum creditor. Jacob Sod, a nursing home executive who was the first to file a lawsuit against Nussbaum, also filed a lawsuit against Wercberger claiming Nussbaum gave $15 million of his money to Wercberger as\n\u201chush money\n\u201d to prevent Wercberger from going to federal authorities.\nWercberger denied the claims and said Sod\u2019s attorneys were \u201crunning all over town, intimidating all of my business contacts and associates.\u201d In June, a Kings County judge dismissed Sod\u2019s claims, but Sod\u2019s lawyers are appealing the ruling.\nNussbaum\u2019s alleged tactics\nNussbaum Lowinger\u2019s clients largely came from Orthodox jewish communities in\nLakewood\n, New Jersey, Brooklyn and Monsey, New York. Nussbaum allegedly offered certain clients a lucrative opportunity. If they sent over funds into his firm\u2019s escrow accounts he would pay a return.\nOne of Nussbaum\u2019s alleged means of producing those high returns was through a novel move called \u201c\nshow capital.\n\u201d Nussbaum would wire escrow funds to real estate dealmakers to show a lender they had enough capital to close on a transaction. The money would appear in the accounts for a short-time, just long enough for a lender to agree to the deal, according to lawsuits and court documents.\nEssentially, Nussbaum\u2019s \u201cshow capital\u201d move allowed a real estate dealmaker to obtain a loan with no equity. Nussbaum would collect a fee along the way.\nBut at some point Nussbaum ran into a deficit and he could not pay back his clients in full. One client, nursing home executive Sod, filed a lawsuit in January demanding Nussbaum return $15 million in escrow funds. That lawsuit triggered more Nussbaum Lowinger clients to file their own suits, claiming that Nussbaum would not return their escrow money.\nQuestions were raised about where the money went.\nAt least $300 million went to a 33-year old Borough Park investor Mendel Steiner, according to Nussbaum\u2019s court filings. One lawsuit alleges Nussbaum transferred the money to Steiner who was supposed to buy properties. But Steiner never bought the properties and instead used fictitious names and contracts in an attempt to prove that money was going to legitimate deals, the lawsuit alleges.\nSteiner died by suicide in January 2025. Days later Nussbaum Lowinger\nshut down\nhis law firm.\n",

        "content": "Amli Residential is shaking up its C-suite for the first time in its 45-year history, handing the CEO reins to a new generation.\nThe Chicago-based multifamily owner and developer promoted Fred Schreiber to CEO from his prior role as executive vice president and chief operating officer,\naccording\nto CoStar. Taylor Bowen, previously president of Amli Development, will now serve as CEO of that affiliate, overseeing the firm\u2019s ground-up pipeline.\nLongtime Chairman and CEO\nGregory Mutz\nis not exiting the stage entirely. He\u2019ll remain chairman, while former Amli President Philip Tague steps into the vice chairman role. The moves formalize a succession plan that has been quietly underway for several years and keeps the company\u2019s founding leadership closely involved, Mutz said in an email to the outlet, adding that Schreiber and Bowen have steadily taken on more responsibility during the transition.\nAfter months of stagnation, U.S. multifamily rents ticked up slightly in December, snapping five straight months of flat or negative growth, according to data from CoStar-owned Apartments.com. While the bump is modest, it\u2019s a welcome signal for large operators navigating higher interest rates, tighter capital markets and a wave of new supply in several Sun Belt metros.\nAmli, founded in 1980 by Mutz and fellow attorney John Allen, has lived through multiple cycles. The firm went public in 1994 as Amli Residential Properties Trust, before Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investing paid $2.1 billion to take it private in 2006. Today, the company remains a subsidiary of Morgan Stanley and controls roughly 26,000 apartments nationwide, with an estimated value of $12.5 billion, according to Mutz.\nThe firm has continued to transact and plan new development. In one recent deal, Amli paid $134 million for the 275-unit\nMilieu tower\nin Chicago\u2019s West Loop. It\u2019s also pursuing a 56-story,\n498-unit apartment tower\nat 669 North Michigan Avenue, a high-profile proposal along the Magnificent Mile.\nSchreiber will remain based at Amli\u2019s Chicago headquarters, while Bowen operates out of\nDallas\n. The company employs nearly 900 people, with major offices in Chicago, Atlanta and Dallas.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The price fell by $20 million the following April.\nEven with today\u2019s listing price being approximately 69 percent of what the billionaire originally sought for the property, if it sold for $135 million it would still surpass the country\u2019s\npriciest home sale of 2025\n, a $133 million property in Naples, Florida, according to Redfin.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time [for the owners] to\nmove to the next chapter\n,\u201d listing agent Kurt Rappaport of Westside Estate Agency told Mansion Global. \u201cThey\u2019re ready to pass the torch.\u201d\nAt 50,000 square feet, the home is one of the largest in the U.S., rivaling the 55,000-square-foot\nWhite House\n. Spanning 16 bedrooms and 27 bathrooms, the main house on the Pritzker Estate boasts a theater, a game room, a bowling alley, a wellness center, a gym and a wine cellar, according to the listing. To stay warm and cool, the home also has 18 fireplaces, solar panels and a heating and cooling system powered by geothermal technology. There\u2019s also a separate two-story, two-bedroom guest house, parking for up to 100 vehicles, a green marble infinity pool and hot tub, a lighted tennis court with a pavilion and an outdoor kitchen.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The landlord alleges the National Urban League defaulted on more than $400,000 in payments.\nFiled in New York state Supreme Court, the lawsuit alleges the nonprofit\u2019s lease expired on June 30, but the organization failed to leave until early August.\nThe nonprofit\nrelocated to 121 West 125th Street\nin Harlem, a mixed-use project recently developed by Taconic Partners, the Prusik Group, L+M Development Partners and BRP Cos. The development includes 170 affordable housing units and the Urban Civil Rights Museum.\nBushburg did not comment to the publication on the suit, but the leader of the National Urban League threatened a countersuit.\n\u201cIt is our position that Bushburg owes compensation to the National Urban League, due to the fact that a dangerous air quality issue rendered the premises uninhabitable for an extended period during 2025,\u201d chief executive officer Marc Morial told Crain\u2019s.\nThe lawsuit draws headlines to a Financial District development looking to make news for entirely different reasons.\nOver the summer, Joseph Hoffman\u2019s firm\nlanded a $320 million construction loan\nfor one of the city\u2019s biggest office-to-residential conversion projects. Bridge City Capital and Deutsche Bank provided the financing for Bushburg\u2019s partial conversion of the 1.2 million-square-foot building.\nBushburg paid $160 million in 2024 to buy the 40-story skyscraper from the Rudin family, which developed the property in 1960.

The debt contains a future funding component that ownership will be able to pull from while leasing and stabilizing the asset, which sits at the intersection of Interstate 84 and Interstate 684.\nLincoln delivered the 618,000-square-foot warehouse last year, a potentially advantageous facility considering its accessibility to several major markets, including the New York City metro area, New England and the mid-Atlantic corridor.

The condo was the most expensive of 20 properties asking $4 million or more to enter contract between Jan. 5 and Jan. 11, up from just 13 in the\nprevious period\n.\nUnit 36 initially asked $21.3 million when the developers began marketing condos off of floor plans roughly a decade ago. The apartment spans 4,500 square feet and has three bedrooms and three bathrooms. It also features 14-foot ceilings and views of Central Park.\nThe deal leaves only two of the building\u2019s 60 units available, including the supertall\u2019s crown jewel penthouse, a quadplex which hit the market in April for\n$110 million\n. The other condo still on the market is penthouse No. 76, asking $49 million.\nSo far, deals have closed for an average of $4,500 per square foot, with some of the building\u2019s priciest sales including the $56 million deal for penthouse No. 72.\nThe Nikki Field Team with Sotheby\u2019s International\ntook over sales at the building in July 2025\n. Also called Steinway Tower, the property includes amenities such as a pool, fitness center and private dining room.\nThe second priciest home to nab an inked deal was a penthouse at 1049 Fifth Avenue, with an asking price of $11.6 million. The Upper East Side condo hit the market in May, asking just under $11.75 million. The seller bought it from the late radio host and political commentator\nRush Limbaugh\nfor just under $12 million in 2010.\nThe 4,700-square-foot apartment spans the entire 20th floor and has five bedrooms and five bathrooms. It also features four terraces and views of Central Park. The pending deal includes a third-floor studio.\nCompass\u2019 Steve Dawson, Dan Colson and the Hudson Advisory Team had the listing.\nOf the 20 properties to find buyers, 12 were condos, four were co-ops, one was a condop and three were townhouses.\nThe homes asked a combined $147 million, which works out to an average of $7.4 million and a median of $6.3 million. The typical home was on the market for more than 3 years and had a discount of 10 percent.\n",

        "content": "CC Homes, led by developers Armando Codina and Jim Carr, cashed out of their Sunrise development site planned for 900 homes for $164.5 million, a big gain in value from its price three years ago.\nNew York-based DW Partners, a land bank for homebuilding titan Lennar, bought the 160-acre former golf course at 7400 Northwest 24th Place from Coral Gables-based CC Homes and its partner Ronald DiGasbarro, according to records. DW Partners and Lennar signed a purchase option agreement for Lennar to purchase the site. The agreement expires in 2031.\nCC Homes also is entitled to receive a portion of the proceeds from each future home sale, records show.\nThe project, called Solterra, is planned for about 400 single-family homes and the remainder of the residences will be townhomes, including affordable townhomes. It\u2019s been in the works since at least 2021, when CC Homes\nscored\na development agreement with the city, including to form the Solterra Community Development District.\nCDDs\nare a common way for developers of large communities in Florida to finance roads, stormwater and sewer systems, sidewalks and other infrastructure. Once residential complexes are sold out, homeowners assume the responsibility to pay back the CDD bonds.\nCC Homes and DiGasbarro paid\n$12.3 million\nfor the site, which used to be the Sunrise Country Club.\nCodina and Carr founded residential development firm CC Homes in 2007. Separately, Codina and his daughter, Ana-Marie Codina Barlick, lead development firm Coral Gables-based Codina Partners.\nMiami-based Lennar, led by Stuart Miller, is considered the second largest homebuilder in the U.S. and the largest in\nsouth Miami-Dade County\n. It heavily relies on land banks to hold developable tracts until Lennar is ready to start building homes. This way, Lennar\noutsources\nland ownership and the risk tied to it, allowing it to carry the land off its financial books and deploy its funds toward construction instead of land ownership.\nNear Pompano Beach, Millrose Properties of Florida, which Lennar spun off as its land bank last year, paid\n$50 million\nlast month for a 20-acre development site planned for 426 condos and townhomes within The Pomp mixed-use project.\nAlso last month, DW Partners paid\n$24 million\nfor 423 homesites in the Keys Gate residential subdivision in Homestead. The seller, JEN Partners, also is a land bank for Lennar, with the homebuilder essentially switching land banks through the deal.\n",

New York Life Insurance provided the financing on Dec. 18, with the deal recorded Dec. 23. A separate Harwood-affiliated entity owns the property.\nCompleted in June 2023, the 26-story\noffice tower\nat 2801 North Harwood Street marked a design-forward expansion for the district. The 360,000-square-foot office tower was designed by Japan\u2019s Kengo Kuma &amp; Associates, with Dallas-based Corgan as architect of record. In addition to office space, the building includes restaurant space and a 17,000-square-foot rooftop and sky garden.\nThe refinancing lands amid a turbulent stretch for Harwood International. Over the past year, the developer sold four office towers to private equity giant TPG, unloading Harwood buildings No. 2, 6, 7 and 10 between early September and early October 2025. The four properties total roughly 900,000 square feet.\nIn November, law firm Jones Day, which was supposed to anchor the upcoming Harwood No. 15 at 3008 North Harwood,\npulled out\nof the project, as previously reported by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nEarlier in 2025, Harwood also sold Harwood No. 4 to Spear Street Capital after defaulting on a loan, with the San Francisco firm planning multimillion-dollar upgrades.\nThe seven-story Harwood No. 1, the district\u2019s original office building at 2651 North Harwood Street, reverted to lender First United Bank after a\nforeclosure auction\nin November, part of a series of at least four foreclosure threats faced by the developer, as Barbier-Mueller\u2019s firm also took on a\n$100 million loan\nat the end of last year.\nThat same Harwood No. 1 has now found a new owner. Dallas-based Cawley Partners purchased the nearly 106,000-square-foot building from First United Trust following the foreclosure, with a $29.5 million acquisition loan, according to deed records. The sale price was not disclosed. First United Bank\u2019s winning foreclosure bid was $27.2 million, while the Dallas Central Appraisal District values the property at $25 million.\nCawley plans to invest $10 million to modernize the building, built in 1984, updating common areas and adding 50,000 square feet of spec suites. The property is about 50 percent leased.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

It is the culmination of a years-long effort by both\nVanderbilt\nand West Palm Beach real estate heavyweights to bring the \u201cHarvard of the South\u201d to the aspiring Wall Street South. Billionaire Related Ross chairman\nSteve Ross\ncommitted $50 million to the campus in April. He\u2019s also hosted fundraisers on behalf of the school and advocated publicly for the project.\n\u201cTo pass up this opportunity would be a crime,\u201d he said at a county meeting in 2024. \u201cThere\u2019s no place that\u2019s ever grown that doesn\u2019t have great universities, great schools.\u201d\nRoss has millions of square feet of office and residential towers in the pipeline in West Palm Beach, and he\u2019s been on a mission to woo major institutions and corporations to fill them.\nCleveland Clinic\nis set to anchor his planned 15 CityPlace with a 120,000-square-foot outpatient center, and he donated $50 million to for an additional 150-bed hospital Cleveland Clinic is planning at 400 and 450 South Australian Avenue, the\nPalm Beach Post\nreported.\nAmong the other real estate donors for Vanderbilt\u2019s planned campus are billionaire Jeff Greene and\nFrisbie Group\u2019s Cody Crowell\n, an alum who committed $5 million.\nVanderbilt launched its fundraising campaign for the West Palm Beach campus last year, with a goal of $300 million. The university did not confirm the total it raised in today\u2019s announcement, but disclosed it would be launching a second phase aimed at raising $250 million.\nPalm Beach County and West Palm Beach City officials\nvoted in 2024\nto gift the university 7 acres of publicly owned land for the campus. In the same vote, county commissioners approved a development and conveyance agreement (DCA) with Vanderbilt that requires the university to spend $300 million in capital expenditures and create 4,500 construction jobs with the project. Vanderbilt must also have 200 full-time employees, 1,000 total students and a $70 million annual operating budget within five years of beginning operations.\nWest Palm Beach won\u2019t be the first satellite graduate campus for the university. It opened in New York City last year at a former Episcopal seminary in Chelsea at 440 West 21st Street.",

The firms converted part of the former offices at the 25-acre location into industrial space, which was followed by increased leasing and upgrades to tenant spaces. Samsung subsidiary Harman International and Charles River Laboratories\u2019 HemaCare are among the tenants at the property, which has some occupants on long-term headquarters leases.\nThe Mix \u201cexemplifies the type of high-quality, credit-anchored campus that institutional lenders seek in today\u2019s market,\u201d Firestone said in a statement. Pendulum Property Partners and Affinius Capital deem The Mix to be \u201ca compelling long-term investment\u201d due to \u201cits scale, diversified tenancy and recent capital program [that] create a resilient cash flow profile.\u201d\nBoth Pendulum Property Partners and Affinius Capital have been active with other holdings across Greater Los Angeles, including elsewhere in the San Fernando Valley.\nIn July, Pendulum Property Partners\nsold the three-building Axis\noffice property in Anaheim for $62.5 million. A month prior, Affinius Capital\nannounced plans\nfor a $54.7 million preferred equity investment in The Latigo Group\u2019s proposed Hillcrest Apartments multifamily development in Thousand Oaks.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Urban Outfitters is pulling the plug on its Gold Coast outpost, creating a rare large retail availability in one of Chicago\u2019s most supply starved, high-rent neighborhoods.\nThe Philadelphia-based clothing and home goods chain will vacate its multilevel space at 1100 North State Street this month, according to signage posted at the store and brokers at CBRE marketing the property, CoStar\nreported\n. The move comes as Urban Outfitters\u2019 lease expires, roughly a decade after the retailer made a then-bold leap north from its former Rush Street site into a pocket better known for steakhouses than soft goods.\nThe vacancy sets up a real-time stress test for top-tier urban retail, which has\noutperformed\nthe broader market since the pandemic upended shopping corridors in early 2020, according to CoStar. While stretches of the Magnificent Mile continue to work through elevated vacancy and repositioning, the Gold Coast has largely thrived, buoyed by\ndense wealth\n, tourism and a restaurant scene that never fully lost its luster.\nUrban Outfitters occupied space on the ground and lower levels of the three-story building, which it shares with Maple &amp; Ash, one of the highest-grossing restaurants in the country. The steakhouse controls part of the ground floor and the entire third floor, anchoring the property with consistent foot traffic day and night.\nCBRE is seeking a new tenant for Urban\u2019s former space, with leasing options ranging from roughly 5,000 square feet to 19,007 square feet, including the vacant second floor. The property is owned by the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio and is being marketed by CBRE brokers Danny Jacobson, Stephen Ansani and Luke Molloy. The marketing brochure from CBRE does not list any asking price.\nUrban Outfitters did not respond to requests for comment from the outlet. It\u2019s unclear whether the brand could return to the\nGold Coast\nin another format. The company still operates Chicago-area stores on North Milwaukee Avenue and at Westfield Old Orchard and Oakbrook Center. Nationally, Urban Outfitters has been experimenting with new store concepts and resale-focused\nReclectic\nstores.\nJacobson told the outlet that interest is already building, with early conversations spanning apparel, food and beverage, furniture and home d\u00e9cor. Some prospects would be new to Chicago.\nThe building sits in the\nViagra Triangle\n, a nickname locals use for the affluent wedge formed by State and Rush streets and Bellevue Place. New retail is also coming online at the base of Newberry Tower Plaza, and Convexity Properties is planning apartments on the former Barnes &amp; Noble site nearby.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The property spans 66,000 square feet and is fully vacant.\nThe building was originally constructed in 1932 and was occupied by WeWork before the coworking company\nabandoned\nits offices there in 2021, the San Francisco Business Times reported.

The coworking giant ended up\nfiling for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection\nin late 2023.\nThe San Francisco office market closed out the fourth quarter with a 32.8 percent vacancy rate, according to CBRE\u2019s fourth-quarter 2025\nreport\n.

        "content": "A 1970s-era office building in the heart of\nDowntown Austin\nis up for grabs.\nHouston-based Highland Resources placed 211 Seventh on the market, according to a release from JLL Capital Markets managing director Jeff Coddington. The Austin Business Journal\nreported\nthat the brokerage team, which includes Coddington, Joe Dowdle and Ryan Stevens, is marketing the 12-story building at 211 East Seventh Street.\nBuilt on roughly 0.7 acres, the 162,000-square-foot office building sits across the street from the historic Driskill Hotel and the Omni Austin Hotel Downtown. It\u2019s also adjacent to Stream Realty Partners\u2019 ongoing remake of East Sixth Street, part of a broader effort to turn the once-raucous\n\u201cDirty Sixth\u201d\ncorridor into a more polished, all-day destination with restaurants and daytime foot traffic.\nJLL is pitching flexibility. A buyer could hold the building as offices, redevelop the site or pursue adaptive reuse, converting the structure to residential or hospitality. The asking price was not disclosed in JLL\u2019s marketing brochure, but the property was most recently appraised at $23.8 million, according to the Travis Central Appraisal District.\nThe optionality of the building comes against a challenging office backdrop. Austin\u2019s office vacancy rate stood at 25.8 percent in the third quarter, according to JLL. Still, Stevens told the outlet that some investors are positioning ahead of a projected rebound.\n\u201cWe expect the Austin\noffice capital markets\nto remain fertile ground for opportunistic, contrarian buyers positioning ahead of a 2026/2027 leasing rebound,\u201d Stevens said in an emailed statement to the publication, pointing to historically low basis levels despite elevated vacancy.\nAbout 62,000 square feet of the building at 211 Seventh is currently being marketed for lease. Based on tenant listings and signage, the building is roughly 61 percent leased, with occupants including Dealerware, ThinkOnward, Brightpearl by Sage and Suvida Healthcare. Those tenants are largely on short-term leases, Coddington said.\nThe site also carries density upside. While\nAustin\nrecently imposed a temporary 350-foot height cap downtown, developers can exceed it by participating in the Downtown Density Bonus Program. According to the publication, the parcel is eligible for a floor-to-area ratio of up to 25-to-1 and sits outside\nCapitol View Corridors\n, removing another common constraint.\nThe adaptive reuse angle could also attract interested parties, as only about 1.1 percent of Austin\u2019s office inventory is considered viable for conversion, according to research from Partners. JLL\u2019s Coddington insisted the building at 211 Seventh is an exception, citing its relatively small floor plates of about 16,700 square feet and high window-to-floor ratio, features that can make residential or hotel conversions more feasible.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Italian investor and entrepreneur Gianluca Vacchi filed a lawsuit against his partner, developer Michael Stern, over his investment in a North Beach development that has not come to fruition.\nVacchi accused Stern and two companies tied to him of a \u201cdeliberated and calculated fraud\u201d in a scathing complaint filed in December, court records show. The lawsuit was temporarily stayed \u2014 in other words paused \u2014 earlier this month, but the complaint remains active.\nVacchi\u2019s GV NBV sued Stern, 6345 JV LLC and 6345 Manager LLC over a $2.5 million investment in the Casablanca property, an oceanfront condo-hotel at 6345 Collins Avenue in Miami Beach.\nThe two\npartnered in 2024\n, forming a joint venture to invest in a $4 billion pipeline of new developments.\nVacchi joined Stern on\nMercedes-Benz Places Miami\n, the Dolce &amp; Gabbana-branded 888 Brickell and the 1250 West Avenue project in Miami Beach. But construction at Mercedes-Benz has moved slowly. At 1250 West Avenue, developer David Martin of Miami-based Terra joined Stern\nto take the lead\non the project last year.\nVacchi also partnered with Stern, Anatomy Fitness owner Chris Paciello and Rafi Gibly on Sunset Padel, an indoor padel members\u2019 only club that operates in Miami Beach\u2019s Sunset Harbour.\nVacchi is part of the wealthy Vacchi family based in Italy. He sold his stake in their IMA Group, a manufacturing empire, in 2023.\nReuters\nreported that year that the private equity firm BC Partners agreed to sell its stake in IMA to BDT &amp; MSD Partners in a deal valuing the company at about 7 billion euros. A year ago, Vacchi was sued by a project consultant based in Naples, Florida, over allegedly\nunpaid fees tied to evaluations\nof the Stern-Vacchi developments.\nVacchi\u2019s attorney, Jason Giller, declined to comment on the lawsuit involving Stern. Stern also declined to comment.\n\u201cSystematic\u201d fraud\nVacchi alleges that Stern\u2019s actions were evidence of \u201cyet another scam conjured up by Stern.\u201d\nVacchi alleges that Stern schemed him into investing $2 million into a planned redevelopment of the Casablanca, in May or June of 2024, through \u201cbrazen misrepresentations, fabricated or improperly modified documents, and concealment of material facts,\u201d according to the complaint.\nThe first $2 million investment was promised as a \u201cquick flip\u201d and a \u201cno lose\u201d proposition, according to the lawsuit.\nStern provided Vacchi\u2019s entity with what Stern allegedly claimed was a third-party valuation on the Casablanca land \u2014 valuing the site between $210 million and $276 million. Vacchi\u2019s company would become a member of Stern\u2019s LLC as part of the agreement. Vacchi pulled the trigger on the additional half a million dollars the following year. The valuation was actually created by JDS\u2019 development director, the lawsuit alleges.\nStern allegedly represented that it would cost $150 million to buy out Casablanca, according to the lawsuit, which would have allowed for a big windfall had he purchased and then flipped the property at the valuation price.\nStern has refused to give Vacchi a membership certificate that shows his investment in 6345 JV LLC. Instead, Stern claims that GV Development Group, not GV NBV LLC, invested in the Stern entity. That dilutes his stake in the project and his overall investment to nearly $2.2 million, the complaint alleges.\nIt\u2019s unknown how Stern and Vacchi will move forward, especially if the lawsuit continues. A source told\nThe Real Deal\nthat Vacchi\u2019s investments are being bought out by an institutional investor.\nVacchi\u2019s lawsuit cites information from JDSPulse.com, a website that\nStern sued\nthe anonymous operator of last year over allegedly defamatory statements. That complaint, filed last year, claims the unknown website owner orchestrated a smear campaign about Stern and his company. Stern is suing to uncover the identity of the person behind the site.\nVacchi\u2019s complaint also alleges that Stern hid an \u201cextensive history of defrauding his investors\u00a0 forcing them to pursue legal actions like this one just to get their money back.\u201d The complaint dives into previous lawsuits that Stern has been involved in.\n\u201cTo make matters worse, Stern also hid that he had a long history of artificially prolonging those legal battles through abusive and deceptive litigation tactics, which any reasonable investor like GV NBV would have wanted to know when deciding whether to invest with Stern or any entity that he controls,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n",

        "content": "Croke Fairchild Duarte &amp; Beres is bucking the Loop\u2019s office downsizing narrative, inking a larger lease and consolidating its downtown space in a riverfront tower on LaSalle Street.\nThe fast-growing Chicago law firm signed a lease for about 40,000 square feet on the fifth floor of the building at 222 North LaSalle Street, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The move will allow the firm to expand from the roughly 25,000 square feet it currently leases across two offices at the buildings at\n180 North LaSalle Street\nand\n191 North Wacker Drive\n, both of which it plans to vacate.\nThe deal stands out amid record high downtown office vacancy and a steady drumbeat of companies shedding space, as hybrid work settles in. While some large law firms have leaned into that trend, Croke Fairchild is moving in the opposite direction, joining a small but notable group of legal practices that have recently\ntaken bigger offices\n. According to the outlet, Cleveland-based Benesch Friedlander Coplan &amp; Aronoff and Chicago-based Goldman Ismail Tomaselli Brennan &amp; Baum have also expanded their downtown spaces over the past year.\nCroke Fairchild embraced remote work early, using flexibility as a recruiting tool and widening its talent pool, said managing partner and co-founder Drew Beres. But rapid growth changed the math on needed office space. The firm added 25 attorneys last year, bringing its headcount to about 110, and is increasingly running into space constraints when lawyers and staff choose to be in the office at the same time.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve noticed as we\u2019ve given people that freedom and flexibility, it seems like people want to come to the office even more,\u201d Beres told the outlet. \u201cWe wanted to make sure we accommodated that.\u201d\nThe 27-story, roughly 1 million-square-foot building at the southwest corner of LaSalle Street and Wacker Drive is owned by the Chicago-based Crown family and was already 93 percent leased before the deal, according to CoStar data. A spokesperson for the\nHenry Crown\nholding company did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe firm\u2019s departure from the building at 180 North LaSalle will be felt more sharply. The 38-story tower, owned by Montreal-based La Caisse, is about 64 percent leased, well below the downtown average of roughly 72 percent, CoStar data shows, but the building at 180 North LaSalle sits across from the James R. Thompson Center, which Google is redeveloping into its Chicago headquarters, a nearby catalyst that could eventually lift demand.\nFilling space remains challenging: The Loop finished 2025 with a net loss of about 370,000 square feet of tenants compared with 2024, according to CBRE.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Illinois\u2019 real estate trade group is beefing up its lobbying team, bringing in former government staffers to lead a push for housing reforms in Springfield and in Chicago.\nIllinois Realtors said on Monday that it was adding Melia Carter as vice president of governmental affairs. Anne Emerseon and Audrey Harding are joining as local government affairs directors to work with the\nChicago City Council\nand Cook County Board of Commissioners, respectively.\nJeff Baker, CEO of Illinois Realtors, told\nThe Real Deal\nthe group is preparing to push for policies that increase density in Chicago and statewide, while opposing potential\nproperty tax hikes\nand tenant protections it argues would stifle investment.\nThe organization will work on \u201csecuring policies that increase housing inventory, incentivize homebuying and thwart burdensome property tax hikes and regulations,\u201d Baker said in a press release.\nCarter will manage Illinois Realtors\u2019 12-member government affairs team, according to the release. Most recently, she led Verizon\u2019s government affairs team across the Midwest and in Chicago.\nOn the local front, the association is bringing in insiders with deep ties to local governments to lead its lobbying efforts. Emerson, who will be focusing on Chicago, was chief of staff for the City Council\u2019s Finance Committee from 2019 to 2023, according to her LinkedIn. She most recently was senior vice president at Mercury Public Affairs.\nHarding, responsible for Cook County, is coming from a post as senior legislative assistant in Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s intergovernmental affairs office. She has previously worked for the Cook County Board of Commissioners, first in Johnson\u2019s office and later for Commissioner Tara Stamps, according to her LinkedIn.\nThe 2026 agenda\nAt the state level,\nIllinois Realtors is backing five bills Baker called the \u201cHousing Stability &amp; Affordability Initiative.\u201d\nTwo of those bills aim to ease local zoning rules and allow for denser housing, Baker said. One would require cities to allow accessory dwelling units, a measure Chicago officials\nenacted in a limited form last year\n. Another would require larger cities to allow \u201cmiddle housing,\u201d including buildings with up to four units and townhomes, on lots of a certain size zoned for any residential use.\nOther pieces of their state-level platform include a cap on impact fees on new developments, and tax advantages for first-time homebuyers. The group is also pushing a bill that would eliminate \u201ccrime-free\u201d housing ordinances, which landlords and advocates have argued are used to discriminate against tenants based on race.\nIn Chicago, the organization will advocate for upzoning, especially near transit stations and on large lots, Baker said.\nIt will also continue opposing efforts to give tenants the right of first refusal to purchase their buildings, a measure that gained some traction last year and is in effect in some neighborhoods. Real estate groups say the policy makes it more difficult for landlords to sell their property and drives up housing costs.\n\u201cRealtors will also continue to be the largest advocate for property rights, whether that is from even more dramatic real estate taxes or restrictions on rentals that end up hurting tenants or driving homeownership further out of reach,\u201d he said.\nThe City Council passed an ordinance giving tenants in the\nSouth Shore and Woodlawn\nneighborhoods the right of first refusal to buy their buildings last year. Similar measures are in place in some\nNorthwest Side neighborhoods\nlike Logan Square and Avondale.\nBeyond the statehouse and city hall, the association plans to launch \u201chousing supply accelerators\u201d in 2026, Baker said. The program will target specific communities to study local zoning codes and recommend changes to bring down construction costs.\n",

        "content": "San Francisco\u2019s ultra-luxury neighborhoods saw home prices rise to\nnever-before-seen numbers\nlast year.\nPrices in the San Francisco Association of Realtors\u2019 District 7,\ncomprising\nthe neighborhoods of Pacific Heights, Presidio Heights,\nthe Marina and Cow Hollow\n, hit their\nhighest-ever levels\nlast year, the San Francisco Chronicle reported, citing a new\nreport\nfrom Compass.\nThe median sales price for houses in the district rose to $6 million in 2025, up 20 percent from the year prior. That marked the fastest increase among any part of the city recorded by Compass data. Across the city, the median house price was approximately $1.7 million last year.\nThe\nBay Area luxury housing\nsector at large saw an upswing last year as middle-income families have been shut out of the market due to economic uncertainty, high housing prices and less-than-deal mortgage rates, opening the door for wealthier households benefiting from the artificial intelligence boom. In San Francisco specifically, the influx of\nAI workers and executives has driven up demand\nfor upscale homes so much that it has created a\nmansion shortage\nin the city. Bay Area tech workers and investors are likely also doing well from massive gains in the stock market, according to analysts.\n\u201cRight now, the economy is more favorable to wealthy people,\u201d Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin, told the Chronicle. That trend isn\u2019t expected to change in 2026, as this year is expected to bring San Francisco\u2019s hottest housing market since pre-pandemic times, Compass analyst Patrick Carlisle said.\nMost of the other Realtor districts in San Francisco haven\u2019t climbed back up to price peaks seen mid-pandemic when interest rates were at historic lows. Prices in the city, including the seventh Realtor district, fell in 2022 and 2023 as mortgage rate hikes poured cold water on a previously red-hot market.\nSince then, well-positioned buyers began shopping in Pacific Heights and Cow Hollow, often without the need for a loan to buy a house. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty jaw-dropping how many buyers we have coming to us who are all-cash, ready to go,\u201d Michelle Harris, a real estate agent with Compass, said. Homes selling for between $2.5 million and $5 million are being bought in a week or less, Harris said.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Dana Johnson,\none of Houston\u2019s top-ranked agents\n, left\nCompass\nfor Douglas Elliman this month.\nJohnson, whose deals last year included one of\nthe most expensive homes sold in Houston\n, joined Douglas Elliman after six years with Compass, citing Compass\u2019 growth as a reason for her departure.\n\u201cSometimes bigger isn\u2019t always better. I feel like at Douglas Elliman, the brand itself is a luxury brand, and that\u2019s what I sell,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cCompass definitely is a luxury brand, but it\u2019s also really large. So you\u2019re not going to get the support that you need, or that I needed, in a broker.\u201d\nHouston has a narrower luxury market than other Texas metros, Johnson pointed out. That might explain why Houston enjoyed the fastest selling homes in Texas last year; Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth and San Antonio all had higher median days on market in the fall, according to\nRedfin\n. When\nAustin had one of the slowest markets in the country\nin October, with a median 104 days on market for luxury homes, Houston had a median of 52 days on market. Dallas and Fort Worth luxury homes both sold after a median 62 days on market, and San Antonio had a median of 91 days on the market.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have very much inventory. You can\u2019t be real choosy,\u201d Johnson said of luxury buyers. \u201cThere\u2019s a very small niche of where they\u2019re going to be, if they\u2019re going to buy a luxury house in Houston.\u201d\nFive of the city\u2019s top 10 luxury deals last year took place within one square mile in the\nRiver Oaks\nneighborhood. Three of the others were in Memorial Villages.\nHowever, Houston\u2019s luxury market isn\u2019t just geographically tight. It also fields an exceptionally small league of agents compared to\nDallas\nand\nAustin\n\u2014 and Compass leads the group. In Dallas, 18 agents represented the 20 parties in the top 10 deals of 2025. In Austin, another 18 agents also represented the 20 parties in the top 10 sales. In Houston, just 10 agents were spread over the top 10 deals, according to\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s research.\nJohnson represented the buyer of the city\u2019s seventh-\nmost expensive residential sale last year\n, a 10,799-square-foot custom mansion at 11321 Green Vale Drive that was asking $9.8 million. Excluding Johnson\u2019s deal, eight of the top 10 residential sales in Harris County last year involved a Compass agent, usually either Laura Sweeney or Dee Dee Guggenheim Howes.\n\u201cWhen I joined Compass, there [were] a hundred agents. Now [there are] 800. It\u2019s just hard to get the support that you need when there\u2019s that many agents,\u201d Johnson said.\n",

        "content": "Trammell Crow is gearing up for another expansion at one of North Texas\u2019 biggest industrial hubs, filing plans for a new phase of its sprawling 35 Eagle development in far north Fort Worth.\nDallas-based Trammell Crow submitted filings for a fourth phase of the project at 2501 Eagle Parkway, near AllianceTexas, according to records with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat the plans call for three new speculative industrial buildings totaling nearly 750,000 square feet, with individual structures sized at roughly 500,000 square feet, 107,000 square feet and 140,000 square feet. The filings peg construction costs at about $40 million.\nIf the plans move forward as filed, construction would begin in February and wrap up in April 2027. Alliance Architects is listed as the design firm. A\nTrammell Crow\nspokesperson declined to provide additional details, noting only that a formal announcement could come later.\nThe expansion would build on the scale Trammell Crow and its partner,\nPGIM Real Estate\n, have already achieved at\n35 Eagle\n. The industrial park spans nearly 5.9 million square feet along I-35 West, near the Perot Field Fort Worth Alliance Airport and the BNSF Intermodal Center, according to Trammell Crow\u2019s website. The most recent phase included five buildings totaling about 2.1 million square feet, with the developer signaling it would pursue additional phases once that space stabilized.\nRecent activity suggests demand remains. In June, Taiwanese technology manufacturer\nWistron\nbought a 324,598-square-foot building within 35 Eagle from Trammell Crow as part of a broader North Texas push tied to its planned $750 million supercomputer manufacturing investment with Nvidia.\nFar north Fort Worth currently has the largest industrial construction pipeline in the U.S., with about 7.7 million square feet under development across 20 projects, according to CoStar.\nBeyond 35 Eagle, Trammell Crow remains active across the region, with projects underway near DFW International Airport, expansions at Passport Park and the Lake Vista Technology Park in Lewisville.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The final days of the Adams administration were busy. Here\u2019s a change that slipped under the radar.\nUnderstandably, the flurry of mayoral\nvetoes\nalongside last-minute\ndrama\non the Rent Guidelines Board garnered a lot of attention at the end of Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 time in office.\nBut the administration also made some changes to environmental review, potentially making it a little easier for certain housing projects to move forward.\nAs part of updates to the City Environmental Quality Review (CEQR) Technical Manual last month, the administration permitted certain housing projects to complete a shorter Environmental Assessment Statement (EAS), which typically takes six to eight months.\nThis change builds on the Green Fast Track\nadopted\nby the administration in 2024. Under that program, housing projects with fewer than 175 units in low-density districts or 250 units in medium- or high-density districts could avoid environmental review.\nBut projects with site-specific issues (such as those relating to air quality, coastal flooding, noise or hazardous materials) couldn\u2019t qualify. The changes last month allow projects that meet the density threshold under the Green Fast Track, but can\u2019t qualify due to site-specific issues, to complete a shorter EAS.\nThe city\u2019s ability to address environmental review-related delays is limited. More extensive changes require state action. State lawmakers have previously proposed exempting large affordable housing projects from environmental review, which passed in the Senate last year but died in committee in the Assembly.\nBut major change could be on the way. As part of her State of the State address, Gov. Kathy Hochul is expected to propose exempting a majority of housing projects from state environmental review,\nthe Wall Street Journal reports\n. She also wants to set a two-year maximum for projects that must undergo review.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: What other housing-related policies will Hochul prioritize in her State of the State address on Tuesday? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing you\u2019ve learned\n: Nonprofit New Destiny Housing is calling on the state to allocate $62.1 million to New York\u2019s supportive housing program in this year\u2019s budget. Last year\u2019s budget included a $17.8 million increase (40 percent) in funding for the New York State Supportive Housing Program, representing the largest investment in 40 years. In a statement, the nonprofit indicated that the governor needs to build on this investment in this year\u2019s budget.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Mayor Zohran Mamdani and his wife, Rama Duwaji, have moved into Gracie Mansion,\nthe New York Times reports\n.\n\u2014 Roughly 15,000 nurses walked out of city hospitals on Monday after their union, the New York State Nurses Association, and several major hospital systems failed to reach an agreement over staffing levels, benefits and other issues,\nAssociated Press reports\n. The hospitals remain open and have hired temporary nurses during the strike.\n\u2014 Mamdani on Monday named Rafael Espinal, who formerly served on the City Council and the state Assembly, as the new commissioner of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Media and Entertainment.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$24.5 million\nfor a condominium unit at 730 Fifth Avenue. The Midtown condo is 3,700 square feet.\nThe Corcoran Group\u2019s\nConnor Cuccinelli and Noble Black have the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$53 million\nfor 63 Crosby Street. The Soho landmark building is 32,400 square feet. Office investment company Vertex purchased the five-story building,\nper reports\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $13.9 million for 25 East 94th Street. The Upper East Side townhouse is 8,200 square feet.\nCompass\u2019\nThe Doyle Team has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 21,386-square-foot, eight-story residential building at 651 Myrtle Avenue in Bedford Stuyvesant. S. Wieder Architect is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "Newsday managed to publish an\nentire article\nabout the conversion of the JFK Hilton into affordable housing without naming the developers, Slate Property Group and RiseBoro Community Partnership.\nYou might ask, What\u2019s the big deal? But think about it. Would a daily newspaper run a story about a New York basketball team winning a playoff series without mentioning the Knicks?\nFor better or worse, it\u2019s pretty common for mainstream publications to cover development without paying much or any attention to the developers. If they are included at all, it\u2019s usually near the end of the piece.\nIn this case, Newsday gave full credit to the Hochul administration for the conversion of the hotel into apartments. Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s own\npress release\nat least cited the developers, but not until the sixth paragraph.\nFrom reading it, you\u2019d think she converted the hotel herself.\n\u201cGovernor Kathy Hochul today announced completion of Baisley Pond Park Residences, a 318-unit, $167 million affordable housing development in South Jamaica, Queens,\u201d it began.\n\u201cBy transforming a long-vacant hotel into hundreds of affordable homes,\u201d Hochul said in the second paragraph, \u201cwe\u2019re delivering real results for low-income and formerly homeless New Yorkers while making smarter use of existing buildings.\u201d\nThe project did get 29 percent of its funding \u2014 $48 million \u2014 from the state\u2019s HONDA fund, which Hochul helped to create. But, reality check: This is a private project by for-profit and nonprofit developers. It is not a state project.\nBefore we even give Hochul 29 percent of the credit, consider that HONDA, which stands for the\nHousing Our Neighbors with Dignity Act\n, has proven very difficult for projects to use, as\nThe Real Deal\nexplained in a much more\ninformative story\nabout the Slate/RiseBoro project.\nTo be clear, I am not criticizing the governor. Her press office got her good publicity, which is what a press office is supposed to do. It also brought attention to a worthy project that might not have happened without the HONDA legislation.\nNor have I ever heard a developer complain about not being mentioned prominently in coverage by a general interest publication. Usually they are happy to stay under the media\u2019s radar because they are accustomed to being hammered.\nWhatever project they propose is criticized as:\nfor people who are too rich (billionaires! gentrifiers!) or too poor (homeless people! crime!)\nhaving too many bedrooms (children will flood local schools!) or not enough bedrooms (families need housing!)\ntoo far from the subway (traffic! parking!) or too close to the subway (crowded platforms and trains!)\nToo profitable (pure greed!) or too risky (that will never work \u2014 you should abandon it!)\nSlate and RiseBoro probably chuckled at being omitted from Newsday\u2019s piece but were surely glad to yield the spotlight to the governor. They know politicians\u2019 currency is praise and publicity. Developers\u2019 currency is permits and profits.\n",

        "content": "Dallas investor and conservationist J. Luther King added 5,000 more acres in the\nHill Country\nto his family\u2019s expansive holdings.\nThe King family acquired a 5,067-acre tract in McCulloch County dubbed the San Saba River Ranch, marking the first change in family ownership for the property since 1898. The centerpiece of the property is a mile-long stretch of the San Saba, which flows year-round. A dam on the property creates a 6-acre reservoir. Two other tributaries of the San Saba River also cross the property, which is about an hour from San Angelo.\nThe seller cleared much of the underbrush from the land, leaving scenic hardwoods and encouraging game population growth. The property also includes a four-bedroom, four-bathroom stone house and a skeet shooting range, according to the listing.\nThe sale price hasn\u2019t been disclosed, but the property was listed for $22.8 million, or $4,500 per acre. The Haynes Team with Triangle Realty co-listed the property with Dullnig Ranch Sales.\nWhile the market for land is subject to the same\nlull affecting Texas luxury homes\nafter the hot streak of 2021 and 2022,\nlive water\nand optimal game conditions continue to generate demand, according to Dullnig Ranch Sales owner Robert Dullnig.\n\u201c\nProximity to metropolitan areas\ndrives a lot of it, so when you get into some areas that are over two hours away, and you don\u2019t have the live water or the big whitetail, those properties are probably taking a little longer to sell,\u201d Dullnig said.\nKing founded Luther King Capital Management Corporation, a Dallas-based investment advisory firm. He and his family own more than 100,000 acres across six Texas counties, including the 4K Livermore in the Davis Mountains and the 4K Brady Creek Ranch.\nThe Kings are about 200,000 acres away from the\ntop 10 list of the largest landowners in Texas\n. The list is topped by the Texas Pacific Land Corporation, the legacy company of the Texas and Pacific Railway. The list ends with commodities broker Mike Smith, who owns 323,000 acres.\n",

        "content": "Days after the Summit Properties\nwon a bankruptcy auction\nfor 5,200 mostly rent-stabilized apartments from Pinnacle Group, the city has filed a formal objection to the sale.\nLawyers for Mayor Zohran Mamdani\u2019s office asked a judge to stop the transaction, raising questions about insider dealing and saying that Summit has failed to show the ability to fix up the properties. It\u2019s\nthe second time\nthe Mamdani administration has objected to the bankruptcy proceedings.\nThe objection is a last-ditch attempt by the Mamdani administration to throw its might behind tenants at the Pinnacle properties. A confirmation hearing for the sale is scheduled for Thursday.\n\u201cOur north stars in these proceedings have always been improving the habitability of the buildings in this portfolio and protecting their rent-stabilized status,\u201d said Leila Bozorg, deputy mayor for housing, in a statement. \u201cAny sale of the Pinnacle portfolio, whether to Summit Gold, Inc. or another bidder, must lead to improved conditions for tenants.\u201d\nThe city argued in its objection that the sale deserves higher scrutiny because of the possibility of insider involvement. That appears to be an oblique reference to a Bisnow report last week that revealed\nJonathan Wiener, brother of Pinnacle head Joel Wiener\n, signed several deeds for properties that Summit claims to own. A declaration from the state attorney general\u2019s office supporting the city\u2019s effort detailed the connections between Summit and Jonathan Wiener. Summit has denied that Jonathan Wiener had any involvement in the sale.\nThe city previously said it has yet to see evidence that Summit has the\nwillingness and ability to fix housing code violations at the properties\n, arguing in court that the legal rents in the units were too low for Summit to both fix the units and profit from the sale.\nThe objection also referenced housing code violations at Summit\u2019s existing properties, which a declaration by the attorney general\u2019s office places around 4,000 open violations in a current portfolio of 3,000 units.\n\u201cThe City submits that Summit must demonstrate that it has the resources, and moreover, the willingness and intent to cure the violations within the time period required by law and, if necessary, rehabilitate the Properties, while remaining financially sustainable,\u201d the objection reads.\nThe state attorney general\u2019s office argued that the city should be given time to come up with another buyer who would take better care of the buildings, or is at least owed a deeper explanation from Summit about its management plan.\nA spokesperson for Summit did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the objection but the company has said it intends to invest in the portfolio, maintain affordability and hire new management firms.\n\u201cSummit has sufficient resources and capital to honor and perform all obligations under the existing resident leases and comply with all regulatory obligations,\u201d it said in a statement to the court. \u201cSummit also is committed to a long-term housing investment and maintaining the quality and affordability of apartments in its portfolio of Pinnacle properties.\u201d\nThe city also objected to the auction before it took place, hoping for a 30-day delay. But the judge\nthrew out that effort\nlast week.\n",

        "content": "Matthew Whitman Lazenby, whose family has owned Bal Harbour Shops since its inception 61 years ago, is in a dog fight with estranged wife, Kristin Lazenby.\nMatthew\nis trying to block Kristin from gaining access to Bal Harbour Shops\u2019 financial records, and he\u2019s seeking a court order to remove a foster dog she adopted from their home in Asheville, North Carolina. Those are the latest salvos in the couple\u2019s bitter divorce proceedings that began more than a year ago, court records show.\nKristin wants bank statements, canceled checks and general ledgers for Whitman Family Development, the entity that owns Bal Harbour Shops at 9700 Collins Avenue. She wants Matthew\u2019s general partnership stake in the luxury mall to be considered a marital asset.\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that the Bal Harbour Shops have been thrust into the Lazenbys\u2019 divorce proceedings which were intended to be a private matter,\u201d Matthew\u2019s attorney Kathyrn Hamilton said in an email statement. \u201cMr. Lazenby\u2019s personal involvement in this multi-generational family business predates their marriage.\u201d\nKristin\u2019s lawyer Paul Leinoff did not respond to requests for comment.\nBal Harbour Shops traces its origins to the late developer\nStanley Whitman\n, who in 1957 acquired a former World War II army barracks site in the village of Bal Harbour. He created an open-air shopping center featuring designer brands in a tropical garden setting, opening Bal Harbour Shops in 1965. Whitman, who died in 2017, was Matthew\u2019s grandfather.\nBal Harbour Shops features landscaped, breezy walkways lined with retailers such as Balenciaga, Balmain, Bvlgari, Chanel, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Ferragamo and Prada, as well as department stores Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue.\nWhitman Family Development is renovating and expanding Bal Harbour Shops by 200,000 square feet, securing a\n$550 million\nloan in 2019 for the project. The mall owner landed a\n$740 million\nrefinancing in 2024.\nTussle over Bal Harbour Shops data\nMatthew is Bal Harbour Shops\u2019 CEO and the operating general partner for Whitman Family Development, whose chairman is Randall Whitman, Matthew\u2019s uncle. Matthew joined the family business in 2003 and rose to his current position a decade later, according to Bal Harbour Shops\u2019 website.\nHe married Kristin in 2009, and they have three children, court records show. She filed for divorce on in July 2024, alleging the marriage is \u201cirretrievably broken.\u201d\nShe is seeking alimony, attorney fees and an equitable distribution of marital assets, which includes three homes, in Bal Harbour, Santa Rosa Beach and Asheville, where she lives with the three kids, her divorce petition states.\nThe couple has duked it out in court motions in recent months. At an October hearing over her demands to see Whitman Family Development\u2019s books, Philip Schecter, a forensic accountant hired by Kristin\u2019s legal team, testified that he needs to know if Matthew is signing a majority of the checks and payments for\nWhitman Family Development\nto determine if Matthew has an \u201cactive participation in the entity.\u201d\nKristin contends in her filings that Matthew\u2019s general partnership stake in Whitman Family Development could be considered a marital asset. Schecter explained that if Matthew is \u201csigning hundreds of checks over a 12-year period\u201d for Whitman Family Development that would show he\u2019s the chief decision maker, as well as determine whether Matthew has paid himself any profit disbursements from the company.\nLeinoff, Kristin\u2019s attorney, told Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Christine Bandin, who is presiding over the case, that Matthew acquired his general partnership interest during the marriage.\nLeinoff said during the hearing that he needed the information to identify what the marital interest is and what the value is, prior to conducting depositions.\nHamilton, Matthew\u2019s attorney, pushed back. She noted Whitman Family Development was formed by Stanley Whitman and his brothers, and that Kristin had not provided proof that \u201cmarital funds\u201d were used to acquire an interest in the company.\nFoster dog caught in the fray\nAs Matthew tangles with Kristin over Bal Harbour Shops\u2019 financial records, he is also seeking to kick out a recent pet addition to their Asheville household. According to a motion filed the same day as the October hearing, Matthew claimed Kristin \u201cunilaterally fostered [a dog] on a temporary basis without the husband\u2019s knowledge or consent, and the wife had the audacity to \u2018double down\u2019 and has now informed the Husband that she has adopted the dog.\u201d\nMatthew alleges the dog killed Lewey and Dewey, the family\u2019s pet birds, and destroyed furniture and personal property inside the Asheville property. His estranged wife also allegedly let the foster and their two other dogs have free rein in the house.\nMatthew lives in Florida 51 percent of the year, splitting his time between the couple\u2019s homes in Bal Harbour and Santa Rosa Beach, according to court filings.\n\u201cThe most recent catastrophe caused by the wife has resulted in the expensive Ipe hardwood flooring in the mudroom being destroyed,\u201d the motion alleges. \u201cThis happened because the wife deliberately left the dog door closed, thereby preventing the family dogs from going outside to go potty.\u201d\nWhen Matthew returned home, he found \u201ca minefield of dried-up excrement everywhere, including all over the floors, the walls, and the doors,\u201d the motion states. \u201cThe wife undoubtedly left this mess to sink into the flooring overnight because she did not want to bother cleaning it, requiring the husband to spend over an hour to clean it up himself.\u201d\nMatthew wants a court order to boot the foster dog or to give Matthew sole, exclusive use of the Asheville house. In a response filed in November, Kristin accused Matthew of violating a May 2025 agreement to settle some of their temporary conflicts, including allowing both of them to stay in the Asheville house. During a deposition, Matthew confirmed that he\u2019s \u201cnow seeking the wife\u2019s removal from her home,\u201d Kristin\u2019s motion states.\nA hearing on the dog and the house is set for April.",

        "content": "In 2025, Dallas\u2019 office market planted seeds. Industry experts intend to watch them grow this year.\nThe office market is finding its footing in the post-pandemic new normal, logging positive annual absorption of office space for the first time since 2019, according to JLL\u2019s fourth quarter report. Last year wrapped up with 1.3 million square feet of positive absorption \u2014 a marked improvement from 2024 when the market saw its first quarter of positive absorption in the fourth quarter, but still ended the year with nearly 1.5 million square feet of negative absorption.\nNormalizing conditions have two trends to thank. First, return to work mandates from major employers like AT&amp;T, Toyota and JP Morgan gave the market a boost. Second, the development pipeline shrank, reaching its lowest level since 2012.\nFor better or for worse, part of the market\u2019s new normal is its stubborn vacancy rate. The market may be settling in, but it\u2019s still carrying around a lot of dead weight. At the end of the fourth quarter, Dallas-Fort Worth\u2019s vacancy rate was 27.2 percent, a slight tick up from the same period of the year before when vacancy was 27.1 percent, according to JLL.\nOffice trades return\nDallas\u2019 sales volume has bounced back, in another example of office market normalization. Buyers returned to the market in 2025, and the year was robust for office trades, which reached levels not seen since 2022.\nIn 2024, almost all of the\nmarket\u2019s largest office trades\nwere scattered around the Dallas-Fort Worth suburbs. The list included distress buys and office/industrial flex properties.\nLast year, investors got excited about Y\u2019all Street and opened their wallets for Uptown trophies. Cousins Properties kicked off the Uptown spree in July with its\npurchase of The Link at Uptown\nfor $281 million, or a whopping $747 per square foot.\nCrescent Real Estate topped that trade in September when it picked up\nTexas Capital Center,\nat 2000 McKinney Street. German investor Union Investment Real Estate sold the 457,000-square-foot property built in 2008 for an undisclosed price, but said in a release that the sale represented \u201ca significant value increase.\u201d The firm bought the building for $226 million, or $500 per square foot in 2016.\nExperts predict 2026 will build on these wins: \u201cCapital is back and ready to be deployed,\u201d JLL wrote.\nElephant in the room\nIt\u2019s not all sunshine and rainbows for the Dallas office market heading into the new year.\nA blemish on the market, the\nsorry state of Downtown Dallas\n, is starting to look more like a wound.\nAT&amp;T dropped a bomb\non the\nstruggling urban core\nwhen it announced last week that it plans to leave its 2 million-square-foot downtown office space for a new 54-acre campus in Plano.\nAT&amp;T\u2019s chunk of the office market makes up almost 6 percent of the submarket\u2019s total space, and its upcoming exit \u2014 which could happen as soon as 2028 \u2014 is sure to push the area\u2019s elevated vacancy rate even higher. The central business district has a vacancy rate of about 33 percent, according to Partners Real Estate.\nThe submarket suffered another blow when Todd Interests\u2019 Shawn Todd announced\nhe\u2019s handing back the keys to The National\n, the skyscraper he spent $460 million converting into a mixed-use project. Starwood Capital Group is foreclosing on the property after providing a $230 million refinancing in 2023.\nThe building at 1401 Elm Street is one of the largest office conversion projects in the country, a poster child for adaptive reuse as a method of breathing new life into crumbling downtown office districts. Todd secured $150 million in state and local incentives to complete the ambitious project, which opened in 2020.\n",

The deal for the five-story, 80,000-square-foot building breaks down to $888 per square foot.\nBritish real estate firm Epic sold the property, which is also known as 15 Little West 12th Street. The company purchased the property for $69 million in 2011, suggesting there was not much profit to be had for the boutique office and retail building, which was developed by Taconic Investment Partners and Square Mile Capital Management.\nTenants include Red Bull, energy company Kimmeridge and the Match Group, parent company of dating services Tinder and Hinge. The estimated rent for office space at the property ranges from $82 to $100 per square foot, according to CoStar.\nTPG and Aurora did not respond to requests for comment on the deal.\nAurora is already one of the largest owners in the neighborhood, ranking up there with William Gottlieb Real Estate. This may be TPG\u2019s first foray into the Meatpacking District, though.\nBobby Cayre founded Aurora in 2001, focused on \u201chigh street\u201d retail. It has since expanded out into developing ground-up boutique office and retail projects, as well as the occasional residential. In August, the company made news when Aurora snagged a signed contract for a penthouse at 140 Jane Street\nasking $87.5 million\n.\nTPG just made a massive deal of its own to start the year,\nbuying a majority stake\nin Lennar\u2019s multifamily arm, Quarterra. TPG Real Estate plans to invest $1 billion in the business and could raise additional capital for growth; Quarterra has built 43,000 apartments across the country since 2011 and has another 13,000 in the pipeline.\nElsewhere in the Meatpacking District, Bilt recently\nsigned a 58,000-square-foot lease\nto take over Samsung\u2019s former office at 837 Washington Street.\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

GO is remaining the majority owner of the assets being partially acquired by Rechler.\nNewmark\u2019s Adam Spies and Adam Doneger arranged the stake sale.\nTight supply in the rental market is keeping prices elevated for tenants.

Here\u2019s what\u2019s on tap for real estate:\nLive Local tweaks\nSen. Alexis Calatayud, a Republican representing a portion of Miami-Dade County, proposed an expansion of the Live Local Act, a workforce housing law that\u2019s riled some counties and municipalities since it was approved in 2023.\nLive Local allows developers to bypass local zoning regulations and public meetings if they designate 40 percent of the units in their projects for households earning up to 120 percent of the area median income.\nThey can obtain approvals administratively and build up to the tallest height permitted within a mile and the highest density allowed in a jurisdiction. It also grants developers property tax exemptions.\nSouth Florida developers have seized on the legislation with a flurry of applications, while some municipalities have decried the Live Local Act for curtailing their say over development. The law has been especially\ncontentious\nin the tri-county region\u2019s\nsmall coastal communities\nthat have maintained strict development regulations and\nfought back large projects\n.\nCalatayud\u2019s\nSenate Bill 1548\nwould expand Live Local to include properties owned by counties, municipalities and schools districts, and it would curb localities\u2019 ability to restrict height via setbacks and stepbacks. The proposal would clarify that farms and farm operations aren\u2019t commercial properties and don\u2019t qualify for Live Local projects.\nAffordability\nLegislators also want to extend the affordability requirement under the Live Local Act.\nUnder the law, the below-market units have to remain as such for at least 30 years.\nHouse Bill 675\n/\nSenate Bill 756\naim to increase this to 50 years.\nIt would also tighten the affordability requirements for developers to get tax abatements. The law allows landlords to obtain a 75 percent property tax break for all units designated for households earning from 80 percent to 120 percent of the AMI. The bills would drop the upper thresholds to 100 percent of the AMI.\nPost-hurricane rebuilding\nLast year, the legislature approved SB 180, titled \u201cEmergencies,\u201d part of which banned local governments from imposing comprehensive plan amendments, land development regulations and site plan approval procedures that could be deemed \u201cmore restrictive or burdensome.\u201d The law applies to counties and municipalities included in federal disaster declarations within 100 miles of a hurricane\u2019s track.\nIt\u2019s meant to remove roadblocks to rebuilding after three hurricanes hit the state in 2024, imposing the restrictions through 2027. For all future hurricanes, the law restricts tighter development regulations for a year.\nBut the controversial proposal riled some local governments that argued it further erodes \u201chome rule\u201d authority over development regulations and potentially opens the door to developers invoking SB 180 over any local zoning change that stands in the way of proposed projects. Several South Florida municipalities joined as plaintiffs in a\nlawsuit\nlast year against SB 180, including Bal Harbour, Fort Lauderdale, Homestead and Palm Beach.\nSen. Nick DiCeglie, a Republican from St. Petersburg, filed\nSenate Bill 840\n, partly curbing the previous legislation.\nThis proposal would hand more control back to counties and cities over development rules, rolling back previously imposed limits.\nIt would roll back the temporary ban on local regulations tied to 2024\u2019s hurricanes until this year. For future storms, it would limit the one-year ban on zoning changes to damaged properties only.\nIt also would narrow the scope of SB 180 to cities and municipalities within 50 miles of a hurricane\u2019s track, while allowing localities to enforce a reconstruction moratorium if it\u2019s to address stormwater, flood management and potable water supply, or sewer repairs.\nRural homebuilding\nLandowners of at least 10,000 acres could bypass county and municipal zoning and other regulations under\nSenate Bill 354\n/\nHouse Bill 299\n, as long as they meet certain development conditions, including the creation of affordable housing.\nCreating \u201cBlue Ribbon Projects,\u201d the proposals add to initiatives that stirred controversy over their potential erosion of local governments\u2019 say over growth and development, and concerns over suburban sprawl.\nUnder the proposals, 60 percent of the land must be reserved for environmental conservation, wildlife corridors, agriculture or other open spaces, and the rest can be developed with up to 12 units per acre. At least 20 percent of residential units must be affordable, workforce housing, or homes for people who qualify under the Florida Hometown Hero Program, including teachers and police.\nQualifying projects can be approved administratively, allowing them to bypass public hearings.\nRep. Lauren Melo, a Naples Republican, and Sen. Stan McClain, a Republican representing Ocala, sponsored the bills.\nNew York-based investment manager Ruane Cunniff, which has amassed roughly 80,000 acres in north Florida counties since 2017, is backing the bills through an affiliate, including hiring lobbyists pushing for the legislation, independent investigative journalist Jason Garcia\nreported\n. Ruane Cunniff has paid at least $230 million for land in rural areas.\nTax breaks\nAfter Gov. Ron DeSantis floated the idea last year of eliminating property taxes for homesteaded residences, lawmakers put forth\noptions\nto achieve it this session.\nThe move would require\nconstitutional amendments\nand approval from Florida voters in November.\nThe resolutions would exempt property taxes funding school districts and mandate that county and municipal budgets for law enforcement should not be reduced.\nHouse joint resolution 201\n, filed by Republican Rep. Monique Miller of\u00a0 Palm Bay, would eliminate all non-school property taxes for homes. Miller\u2019s\njoint resolution 203\nproposes to increase the value of homestead exemptions by $100,000 each year for 10 years starting in 2027, phasing out property taxes by 2037.\nHJR 205\n, filed by Republican Rep. Juan Carlos Porras, who represents part of Miami-Dade County, would eliminate property taxes for homeowners who are 65 and older.\nRep. DeFuniak Springs, a Republican representing a portion of the Panhandle, filed\nHJR 207\n, proposing to add homestead exemptions for 25 percent of the home\u2019s assessed value after all other exemptions are applied.\nLocal governments, including Orlando and Orange County, have warned the proposals could hit\nbudgets\nfor parks, infrastructure maintenance and improvements, fire departments and other services.\nHOAs\nPorras is going after homeowners associations this session.\nResidents living in HOAs across the state have accused some board members of wrongdoing including election interference, misappropriation of funds, unjustified assessment increases, and bullying and retaliation against those who speak out.\nThe most extreme case was at the\nHammocks\nin West Kendall, South Florida\u2019s largest HOA on 3,800 acres and with 18,000 residents.\nPorras, the majority of whose district consists of the Hammocks, proposed legislation that would allow residents to disband their HOAs. But attorneys say it\nwon\u2019t work\n.\nUnder\nHouse Bill 657\n, residents could start the dismantling process with a petition signed by 20 percent of homeowners, which the board must vote on at a meeting and also set the termination rules, requiring approval by two-thirds of homeowners. The plan of termination would be filed in court, and a termination trustee, such as the board or someone appointed, would oversee the dismantling of the HOA, including the sale of assets.\nExperts in HOA law said this would be difficult, because HOAs own infrastructure such as stormwater and sewer systems, landscaping and roads, and not just sellable assets such as maintenance equipment.\n\u201cYou may be dissolving the actual corporation, but how are you going to split up the assets?\u201d said attorney Carolina Sznajderman Sheir. \u201cWho is going to take responsibility for maintaining the roadways [and other infrastructure]? Who is going to be responsible for operating, maintaining and insuring this?\u201d\nCounties and municipalities would be reluctant to assume responsibility for this infrastructure partly because it could mean increasing taxes to maintain common areas that only HOA residents use, attorneys said.\nHB 657 has other provisions, some of which attorneys hailed. It would create a Community Association Court, alleviating the backlog of HOA and condo association cases at circuit courts.",

        "content": "Investor\nAlon Abady\nhas made his latest real estate play, this time in the form of a 300,000-square-foot\noffice campus\ndonation to West Coast Chabad.\nThe 16-story office building in Pico-Robertson, with a 1,200-vehicle parking facility, sits on an acre and a half at 9911 West Pico Boulevard and was recently appraised for $103 million, according to Abady. He and his wife Monique made the donation in honor of Alon\u2019s mother, Liora Abady.\n\u201cWhen we moved to the States in the late 70s, we had nothing,\u201d said Alon, whose mother found a job with Chabad after the family immigrated to Los Angeles. \u201cThey were there for us when we first came here and that carried a personal weight.\u201d\nAbady, who is managing partner of Waterfall Bridge Capital, paid Blackstone $35 million, or about $140 per square foot, for the property in 2023 with plans to redevelop it. That could still happen with the property holding by-right entitlements, which holds the door open for a possible residential conversion.\nHowever, plans in the near future call for the building to serve as the Chabad Campus for Jewish Life, which will encompass a synagogue, educational facilities, mental and social services, a banquet and events hall and the Abady Family Center once fully operational.\nAbady described the building as \u201cspecial\u201d and an \u201ciconic LA property,\u201d sitting between Culver City and Beverly Hills. Fox Studios is located next door, while Hillcrest Country Club sits opposite the property. In a sea of mostly low-rise commercial or multifamily structures, 9911 Pico Boulevard can be seen driving from the east or west.\nAbady\u2019s latest deal, which closed on Friday, is different from some of the other trades tied to his name within the local marketplace.\nThe investor is best known for his $96 million purchase of the Sofitel Hotel in Beverly Hills in 2021, but his name is also known in high-end residential real estate.\nThat portfolio includes the 2020, $25 million purchase of\nSimon Cowell\n\u2019s former home at 717 North Palm Drive in Beverly Hills, which Abady flipped for $34 million three years later. Also in 2023, Abady sold a property in the gated Madison Club community of La Quinta to Justin and Hailey Bieber for $16.6 million. More recently, in 2024, he paid $17 million for 1357 Laurel Way, which was previously owned by conservationists\nDan and Susan Gottlieb\n.\n",

        "content": "A newly built home in\nManhattan Beach\n\u2019s Hill Section neighborhood found a buyer last week to make for Los Angeles County\u2019s top residential property to go into contract.\nBuilt in the trendy modern farmhouse style, the six-bed, eight-bath home of more than 6,000 square feet was asking $8.8 million, or $1,424 per square foot.\nThe property appeared in the\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n, which ranks signed contracts based on asking price. Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team compiles the weekly report, which uses Multiple Listing Service data and an asking price floor of $4 million.\nIf the deal on 711 North Dianthus Street closes, the buyer will walk away with a discount from the original ask of $9.3 million, when the home first hit the market in March.\nProperty records show an entity called BM Investments scooped up the home in 2022 for $2.6 million, with state filings tying the limited liability company to real estate investor Bedros Najarian and the Hawthorne address of a company called Doon Builders.\nThe listing is held by Thompson Team Real Estate\u2019s Joseph Nuzzolo.\nThe property\u2019s location in the Hill Section places it in the same neighborhood as Los Angeles Lakers point guard\nLuka Don\u010di\u0107\n.\nAlthough, the home Don\u010di\u0107 paid for last August amounted to $25 million for what was previously tennis star Maria Sharapova\u2019s former pad. That off-market closing edged past the $24.5 million sale of\n1800 The Strand\nas Manhattan Beach\u2019s priciest residential sale on record.\nLast week\u2019s next priciest listing to fall into contract, according to the Eklund Gomes report, was 2311 Worthing Lane, located in the Bel Air Crest community.\nDesigned as an East Coast traditional-style home, the property is listed for just under $8 million, or $864 per square foot.\nIt counts five beds and 7 baths across 9,200 square feet, with the listing held by the Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Lea Porter.\nThe home first hit the market in September asking nearly $9 million before seeing a price reduction the following month.\nProperty records and listing sites show the home last sold in 2011 for $3.2 million and is currently owned by a trust tied to Brian and Mira Lee. Brian is a serial entrepreneur, who co-founded LegalZoom, ShoeDazzle and Honest Co.\nAcross Los Angeles County, signed contract activity last week shook out to be about on par with the year-ago period. A total of 13 homes went into contract, equating to about $77 million in asking volume, according to the Eklund Gomes report.\n",
