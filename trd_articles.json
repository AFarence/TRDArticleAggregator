        "content": "Hedge funder Marc Lasry is looking to ghost the fictional Shandor Building from \u201cGhostbusters.\u201d\nThe Avenue Capital Group co-founder and former owner of the NBA\u2019s Milwaukee Bucks listed his penthouse unit at 55 Central Park West for $42 million, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The listing for the co-op breaks down to $8,400 per square foot.\nLasry and his wife, Cathy, bought the four-bedroom unit in 2013 for $33 million. Adjusted for inflation, the asking represents a loss from the purchase price. But the listing is the most expensive for a co-op in the city, according to StreetEasy.\nThe duplex includes 2,200 square feet of terraces, a living room with a fireplace and views of Central Park, a primary suite with a dressing room and a library with a bar and high ceilings.\nThe 19-story, 109-unit Art Deco building was constructed in 1930 and received pop culture attention for serving as the Shandor Building in the 1984 supernatural comedy. Amenities at the building include a children\u2019s playroom and a roof deck.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Alan Nickman and Stephen O\u2019Neal share the\nlisting\nwith a Compass team including Allison Chiaramonte.\n\nAvenue Capital launched in 1995 and manages more than $10 billion in assets across the globe. Lasry also partnered on the purchase of a stake in the Bucks for $550 million in 2014. In 2023 \u2014 two years after the Bucks ended a half-century championship drought \u2014 Lasry sold his stake to the Haslams in a deal valuing the franchise at $3.5 billion.\nIn 2019, the billionaire\nsold a $9.5 million\n, one-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment at 812 Fifth Avenue to William Reeves, co-founder of hedge fund BlueCrest Capital Management.\nThe year prior, Lasry sold his six-story townhouse at 4 East 74th Street\nfor $31.5 million\nto an anonymous buyer. It was originally listed for $39 million and later chopped to $35 million, but it\u2019s unclear how much Lasry bought it for in the first place.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The project, called\nMetropolitan Park\n, is vying for a state gaming license.\nMeanwhile, Cohen\u2019s residence at 901 Oxford Way, which is listed for $35 million, was last week\u2019s top home to go into contract based on asking price, according to the\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n. The listing equates to $2,764 per square foot.\nThat\u2019s discounted from the $45 million, or $3,553 per square foot, the home was asking back in May.\nCohen\n, the founder of S.A.C. Capital Advisors and Point72 Asset Management, bought the residence in 2015, according to\nForbes\n. Spec developer Gala Asher was the seller at the time, according to the deed.\nProperty and state records show the home\u2019s owner as a Delaware limited liability company called Crown West, which is managed by Point 72 chief investment officer Andrew B. Cohen and also tied to the same address as the financial firm.\nThe nine-bedroom, 13-bathroom home spans 12,700 square feet. It\u2019s close to the Beverly Hills Hotel. Among the home\u2019s many amenities are a living room bar, elevator, private space to take meetings, waterfall, spa, game room and underground parking.\n\nCompass\u2019 Ginger Glass has the listing.\nIt was a big week for Glass, who also holds the listing of Los Angeles County\u2019s second-largest home to go into contract, along with Compass\u2019 Alexandra Glass.\nThat\u2019s for the home at 1535 Blue Jay Way in the Hollywood Hills, which is listed for just under $27 million, or $2,268 per square foot.\nThe L-shaped home, which is being sold by a trust, was built in 2021 and has six bedrooms and eight bathrooms across nearly 12,000 square feet.\nHighlights include a half-Olympic length pool, spa, 150-year-old olive trees and both city and ocean views.\nTwenty-nine homes in L.A. County went into contract last week, which was one more deal than a year ago, according to the roundup produced by Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team. The report counts homes appearing in the Multiple Listing Service with an asking price of at least $4 million.\nTotal asking volume was $252.9 million, which was a jump of nearly 47 percent from the same time last year.\n",

        "content": "Mayor Brandon Johnson is preparing to bring back one of Chicago\u2019s most controversial revenue tools \u2014 the corporate head tax \u2014 as the city faces a projected $1.15 billion shortfall next year.\nThat\u2019s according to sources familiar with his upcoming budget proposal, Crain\u2019s first\nreported\n.\nThe\ntax\n, enacted in 1973 and eliminated under Rahm Emanuel in 2014, charged companies with 50 employees or more $4 per worker per month, according to the nonpartisan\nTax Foundation\nas well as the\nInstitute for the Public Good\n, which produced a policy paper in September in support of the proposal.\nThe concept has been derided by the city\u2019s business community as an anti-growth penalty. The\nIllinois Policy\nInstitute came out against the head tax, as well as the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce this\nsummer\n.\nJohnson, who will unveil his third spending plan this week, appears ready to test that argument.\nWhile Johnson has repeatedly vowed to make the wealthy and big corporations \u201cput more skin in the game,\u201d his options are narrow. State law bars the city from extending the sales tax to services or imposing a local corporate income tax, leaving him with politically fraught levers like a head tax, higher cloud-computing levies, or inflation-tied hikes to city fines and fees.\nThe mayor\u2019s allies have floated a range of proposals.\n\nThe Institute for the Public Good proposed a tenfold increase to the previous head tax to $40 per employee on large companies, potentially bringing in tens of millions in annual\nrevenue\nand also to bring inflation-adjusted and full-time employee equivalent fees up to par with the impact the $4 head tax had in 1973.\nProgressive Caucus members floated lower sticker prices. Johnson\u2019s team is said to be eyeing a lower rate, aware that he\u2019ll need at least 26 City Council votes to pass a budget that already faces pushback from moderates and business groups.\nCorporate leaders are bracing for a fight.\nThe Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce warned that another tax on employers would discourage hiring and drive investment elsewhere.\n\u201cAdding additional taxes on businesses to fill the budget gap will disincentivize businesses from employing people in Chicago,\u201d CEO Jack Lavin said in a statement. Illinois Policy Institute suggested spending caps, fixing pension debt and other cuts to reign in the budget deficit.\nThe business pushback comes as the administration also weighs extending a citywide hiring freeze and trimming departmental budgets by up to 5 percent. Unions, meanwhile, are lobbying to prevent layoffs and pressing aldermen to embrace new revenue sources instead.\nJohnson\u2019s challenge echoes last year\u2019s bruising budget fight, when his proposed\nproperty tax increase collapsed\nbefore a final vote.\n",

Another 80 residences will be constructed for residents 55 and older.\nThe housing will be priced for low-income and very-low income individuals earning 30 percent to 80 percent of the area\u2019s median income, or between\n$33,600 and $87,550\nfor one person.\nThe project site houses a 10,000-square-foot office property, Sunset Development\u2019s service center, which will be torn down. The site is across from City Village, a 404-townhome development from SummerHill Homes, which is under construction.\nAmenities include a technology center, career and school resource center, barbecue and picnic areas, bicycle parking, children\u2019s play areas and co-working areas for adults. The senior residences will have a fitness center, technology center and outdoor deck. There will also be a central communal courtyard, dog park and community garden with direct access to Iron Horse Trail.\nThe development is \u201can investment in San Ramon\u2019s future as an inclusive, sustainable community,\u201d said\nAlex Mehran Jr.\n, CEO of Sunset Development. The development is \u201cespecially critical for families and seniors in a region that is growing rapidly and urgently needs more affordable homes,\u201d said Linda Mandolini, president and CEO of Eden Housing.\n\nThis is the latest instance of offices being replaced with housing as part of the grand plan to transform the office complex into a mixed-use neighborhood. The effort has been helped in part by companies like Chevron cutting their office space at Bishop Ranch in recent years.\nIn June, Sunset Development filed formal development applications to gut 761,000 square feet of office space to make way for two residential communities, adding 485 units of housing as part of the endeavor to\nbuild 8,000 units\non site.\nThat proposal calls for demolishing the three-building, 652,000-square-foot Canopy office complex and building a 412-unit residential community of 255 detached townhomes and a 157-unit five-story apartment building.\nOf the 412 units, 62 will be deed-restricted affordable housing with at least 22 reserved for very-low-income households. Sunset also submitted plans to build 73 housing units at 2 Annabel Lane to replace a 109,000-square-foot office building with 64 townhome condominiums and nine accessory dwelling units.\nSunset plans to\nturn the old Chevron headquarters into The Orchards\n, a development consisting of 2,510 homes, 125,000 square feet of town-center-style retail and a 2.5-acre community park.\nOther housing projects at Bishop Ranch in the works include Related California\u2019s 380-unit luxury apartment building at 6201 Bollinger Canyon Road and\nAvalonBay\n\u2019s 457-unit project across the street from the City Center retail complex.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A judge temporarily halted the planned transfer of a valuable downtown Miami parcel slated for President Donald Trump\u2019s future presidential library, intervening in a high-profile land deal involving public property.\nMiami-Dade Circuit Judge Mavel Ruiz issued the temporary injunction on Tuesday, the\nAssociated Press\nreported. The injunction will remain in effect until Ruiz issues a final verdict or Miami Dade College holds a new, publicly noticed meeting to discuss the transfer of the land.\nRuiz sided with Miami activist Marvin Dunn, who on Oct. 6 sued Miami Dade College, alleging the school violated Florida\u2019s open government laws by failing to give adequate public notice before approving the land transfer to the state last month.\nRuiz noted that the college \u201cdidn\u2019t give the public reasonable notice ahead of the vote,\u201d but emphasized the case was \u201cnot rooted in politics.\u201d\nThe nearly 3-acre property at\n500-540 Biscayne Boulevard\n, valued at about $67 million by the Miami-Dade County property appraiser, sits on one of the few remaining undeveloped stretches in\ndowntown Miami\n.\nReal estate analysts said the site \u2014 surrounded by luxury condo towers, two museums and two waterfront parks \u2014 could fetch several times its assessed value if sold on the open market.\n\nThe college\u2019s board of trustees voted during an early morning meeting on Sept. 23 to convey the land to a state fund overseen by Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet. A week later, the governor and cabinet voted to transfer the parcel to the foundation that will develop\nTrump\u2019s library.\nThat group is led by\nEric Trump\n, Michael Boulos \u2014 husband of Tiffany Trump \u2014 and presidential attorney James Kiley.\nAttorneys for Dunn argued that the Sept. 23 meeting agenda gave no details about the location or purpose of the transaction. Miami Dade College\u2019s lawyers insisted the board followed legal requirements, and that any delay in transferring the land could cost the college up to $300,000.\nOther Florida universities, including Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University, were previously considered for the library site. State lawmakers earlier this year passed legislation to shield such projects from local government objections.\n\u2013 Francisco Alvarado\n",

Weidenmuller was awarded $503,000 by a court from Minaj and Petty, though he reportedly has yet to receive it. That led to the security guard asking the court on Oct. 6 to order Minaj\u2019s home to be sold to help him collect the money he is owed.\nMinaj owns an 11-bedroom, 16-bathroom\nhome in Hidden Hills\nspanning 11,820 square feet. She purchased it in December 2022 for $19.5 million.\nWeidenmuller said in his motion that he believes the home is worth enough to pay off the\nmortgage\n, liens and the debt he is owed. The plaintiff said that Minaj has a $13.3 million mortgage lien on the home and a \u201c$722,151 homestead exemption \u2014 together just under $14 million.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe property\u2019s current fair market value is appraised at $20 million, yielding approximately $6 million in equity beyond the lien and exemption. That amount is more than sufficient to satisfy the judgment, plus accrued interest and enforcement costs,\u201d Weidenmuller said.\nWeidenmuller alleged that while working at Minaj\u2019s show on March 22, 2019, a fan broke through the security barrier and was able to get on stage with Minaj. She allegedly became upset with the security team, leading him to tell Petty about what happened. When Weidenmuller entered Minaj\u2019s dressing room, he reportedly was greeted by Minaj, Petty and two security guards, and Petty \u201cwithout warning\u201d struck him in the face. The security guard was rushed to the hospital and doctors determined he suffered serious injuries and required surgery to fix his jaw.\nThe security guard is pursuing the seizure after Minaj and Petty failed to respond to his lawsuit, prompting the court to enter default judgments against the couple in March of last year.\n\u201cAlthough it is regrettable that the extraordinary measure of forcing the sale of Minaj\u2019s dwelling is required, that result is entirely the product of her intransigence in not making payment,\u201d Weidenmuller\u2019s lawyer said. \u201cMinaj is a global music superstar, estimated to have a net worth of anywhere between $150 [million and] 190 million, and is reportedly the highest paid female rap star in the world. There is little doubt that she is highly capable of paying the judgment in full and, yet, she has refused to do so despite multiple written requests for payment and levies served upon several of her suspected creditors.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Bally\u2019s is facing a revolt from lenders over its latest debt proposal, a standoff that could ripple far beyond Wall Street \u2014 all the way to Chicago\u2019s pension funds.\nA group of creditors banded together to block the casino operator\u2019s plan to amend roughly $1.9 billion in term loans Tuesday, Bloomberg\nreported\n, raising fresh doubts about the company\u2019s ability to finance its long-delayed\nChicago resort\n.\nThe junk-rated firm failed to win lender support by last week\u2019s deadline, with investors uneasy about the value of the properties securing the debt and the pace of future repayments.\nAt the center of the dispute is\nBally\u2019s\nattempt to reclassify its under-construction Chicago casino as loan collateral while also seeking approval to sell and lease back its Twin River Lincoln Casino Resort in Rhode Island for $735 million.\nBally\u2019s has said it would use about $500 million from that sale to pay down senior secured debt, including portions of its revolving credit and term loan, trimming first-lien obligations to about $1.94 billion.\nBut creditors want more detail on how the company intends to manage cash and repay debt after recent repayments to Apollo Global Management \u2014 a move that raised eyebrows among some investors.\n\nThe dissenting lenders, advised by Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld, have questioned the declining value of the company\u2019s property collateral and are pressing for new guarantees tied to Bally\u2019s 58 percent stake in Greek gaming company Intralot, acquired through a deal completed earlier this month.\nThe stalemate is a critical obstacle to Bally\u2019s push to extend at least $600 million in term-loan maturities to 2030. Lenders on its revolving facility have already agreed to the extension, arranged by Deutsche Bank, but the broader amendment remains in limbo. Bally\u2019s term loan slid to about 90 cents on the dollar this week, down from 95 on Friday, reflecting mounting investor anxiety.\nFor Chicago, the timing couldn\u2019t be worse. The city is counting on the long-promised Bally\u2019s casino \u2014 approved in 2022 and expected to generate hundreds of millions for its underfunded pension systems \u2014 to advance beyond its temporary\nRiver North\nsite.\nBally\u2019s\ninsists its balance sheet is \u201cfantastic,\u201d citing more than $1 billion in cash and credit access. Unless the stalemate breaks, the company\u2019s financing gamble could leave Chicago\u2019s casino dreams on hold.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Owned by classic car enthusiasts active in local restoration clubs, the home includes a 6,200-square-foot showroom attached to the 12,500-square-foot home.\nThe property also includes an\nequestrian\nbarn that can accommodate four horses.\nThe sellers listed the home for $5.9 million last July and have modestly reduced the price several times since then. It is one of the most-expensive homes on the market in\nMcKinney\n, a Collin County suburb about 30 miles north of Dallas.\n\nHolly and Andi Haven of Real Broker have the listing, and Florida-based\nElite Auctions\nis handling the auction. Elite has held auctions for other North Texas homes, but this is the company\u2019s first in McKinney. It will take place on site at 11 a.m. Nov. 7.\nMany sellers turn to auctions after exhausting the conventional listing process. Elite Auctions has seen a threefold increase in auction candidates this year, CEO Randy Haddaway said. That might be fueled by a\nsoftening of the luxury market\n, especially in the\nSun Belt\n.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of inventory that needs to be cleaned up around the country,\u201d Haddaway said.\nNationally, luxury sellers are pulling back from the market, according to\nRedfin\n. While some markets have been hit harder, Texas is among those slowing down.\nAustin\n, once a tech boomtown, had one of the highest seller-to-buyer ratios in the country during the hot season, with inventory especially high in the luxury condo class.\nRelistings are taking up an increasingly high share of the state\u2019s ultra-luxury inventory\n, mostly concentrated in Houston and Dallas.\nThe most recent headliner auction in the area was a Southlake mansion at 1469 Sunshine Lane. Previously listed for $27.5 million, the\nhome\u2019s winning bid was $14.22 million\n, less than the expected starting bid.",

        "content": "SL Green is buying the Park Avenue Tower in the Plaza District for $730 million.\nMarc Holiday\u2019s REIT just went into contract to buy the 36-story tower at 65 East 55th Street from the Blackstone Group, sources told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe price tag is a discount to the roughly $925 million that Blackstone put into acquiring and renovating the building since 2014. Investors have come off the sidelines in recent months seeking out bargains on office buildings, particularly in the Plaza District where demand from tenants has created a hot market for available office space.\nSL Green moved quickly on the tower once it hit the market and preempted other bids, according to a source familiar.\nRepresentatives for SL Green and Blackstone could not be immediately reached for comment. An Eastdil Secured team led by Gary Phillips and Will Silverman negotiated the sale.\nThe largest tenant is PineBridge Investments, the asset manager acquired last year by MetLife for $1.2 billion, which occupies about 75,000 square feet. Other major tenants include the investment bank BTIG, the venture capital firm Raine Group and a division of the Creative Artists Agency.\n\nBlackstone bought the building for\n$750 million\nin 2014 from Shorenstein Properties.\nIt was actually the second time the company owned the property. It had originally acquired the tower in 2007 as part of its takeover of Sam Zell\u2019s Equity Office Properties, and then quickly flipped the building and six others to Harry Macklowe.\nMacklowe lost the property to his lender, Deutsche Bank, which sold it and another office building (850 Third Avenue) for $930 million to Shorenstein in 2008.\nAfter two major tenants left in 2016, Blackstone spent about $170 million to renovate the building, including a new lobby, mechanical updates and converting the basement into an amenity space.\nThe private equity firm had put the building up for sale in 2019, eyeing a price tag of\n$800 million\n, but no final deal materialized. It refinanced the property last year with a\n$309 million\nCMBS loan originated by Morgan Stanley.\nSL Green, meanwhile, has been active in the market looking for deals. The company last month went into contract to buy the former Brooks Brothers building on Madison Avenue, where it plans to build its next ground-up office tower. It was also recently in the bidding for Paramount Group, and expressed interest in acquiring the Chrysler Building.\n",

        "content": "Crescent Heights scored a $238.4 million refinancing for the luxury 588-unit Forma Miami apartment tower in Edgewater.\nThe deal marks a continuing lending flurry in South Florida, despite elevated interest rates.\nCrescent Heights \u2013\u2013 led by Russell Galbut, Sonny Kahn and Bruce Menin \u2013\u2013 completed the 40-story Forma at 2900 Biscayne Boulevard in Miami last year, according to records. It includes 85,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor amenities and a 50,000-square-foot Whole Foods Market.\nThe fixed-rate refinancing was provided via Freddie Mac\u2019s Lease-up program, according to a Walker &amp; Dunlop news release. Aaron Appel and Jonathan Schwartz were part of the Walker &amp; Dunlop team that represented Crescent Heights.\nThe Freddie Mac Lease-up program targets multifamily properties that are approaching stabilization, but haven\u2019t achieved it yet. Generally, more than 90 percent of units have to be leased for a property to be considered stabilized.\nForma is already stabilized, but wasn\u2019t when it initially applied for the refinancing, according to Walker &amp; Dunlop\u2019s Michael Stepniewski, who also represented Crescent Heights.\nGalbut said the tower is 97 percent leased.\n\nDesigned by Rockwell Group and Arquitectonica, Forma offers studios and one- to three-bedroom units with condo level finishes, the Walker &amp; Dunlop news release says.\nApartments.com\nshows monthly rents range from $3,080 to $7,515.\nCrescent Heights owns 9 acres of properties next to Forma that it plans to develop into a city center, the release says.\nIn other recent refinancings, Treo Group scored\n$132 million\nthis month for its two-building Vox I and II student housing campus with 262 units, combined, at 7025 and 7175 Southwest 59th Avenue in South Miami. Midtown Capital scored a\n$57 million\nbridge loan last month for its 230-unit Astor Sound apartment complex that it\u2019s developing at 2253 Keast Lane in Lake Worth Beach.\nIn August, Acre landed\n$72 million\nto refinance its 236-unit Adela at MiMo Bay at 6445 Northeast Seventh Avenue in Miami\u2019s MiMo Biscayne Boulevard Historic District.\nSouth Florida\u2019s multifamily market is experiencing a supply overhang following a construction boom. A pandemic-era influx of out-of-staters fueled unprecedented demand and record rent growth, prompting developers to jump on new projects. Last year, they completed a record\n18,600 apartments\nin South Florida, outpacing 15,000 net new leases signed, according to CoStar Group data. This led to lower rents and more concessions.\nDevelopers still are starting new projects, arguing that by the time they complete their buildings next year and in 2027, demand will be restored.\nOak Row Equities is developing the 324-unit\n2900 Terrace\non the northeast corner of Northeast 29th Street and Northeast Fourth Avenue in Miami\u2019s Edgewater. In the Miami Design District, Miami Design District Associates, which includes Craig Robins\u2019 Dacra, Hunter Pasteur and The Forbes Company, scored a\n$125 million\nconstruction loan in June for the 107-unit Cassi apartment project at 91-93 Northeast 36th Street.\n",

        "content": "A Kenilworth home a few blocks from the beach approached the high watermark for non-lakefront sales in the village, days after another property\nset a likely record\nfor inland sales in Kenilworth.\nThe house at 207 Cumberland Avenue sold for $5.9 million Tuesday, according to a social media post from listing agent Jena Radnay. The nine bedroom, nine-and-a-half bathroom house is situated a short walk from the beach on the north end of Kenilworth. It spans 9,600 square feet and sits on a 0.76-acre lot.\nThe price pencils out to $615 per square foot.\nThe sale followed a $6.1 million deal last week for a gutted and modernized historic house on Kenilworth Road. That transaction, brokered by @properties\u2019 John Mawicke, appears to be the most-expensive non-lakefront home sale in the village in several years, and the Cumberland Avenue property is not far behind.\nIt went under contract a little more than a month after it was listed in July, reflecting high demand for luxury housing in the North Shore, even outside the top-tier lakefront properties.\n\u201cIt just shows you that the values are very high for a 3,000-resident village,\u201d Radnay told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nRadnay, an @properties agent and major broker for North Shore lakefront properties, said she\u2019s seeing interest from buyers in Chicago and out of town who want to move to the North Shore. With inventory in such short supply, buyers are turning their attention from the most-expensive cities like Winnetka and bringing more competition into Kenilworth.\nThe Cumberland Avenue house last sold in 2013 for $4.2 million. The house was owned under a land trust that obscures the owner\u2019s identity, but property tax bills were addressed to Jason Hanold, according to public records, which indicate the previous owners paid $74,000 in property taxes in 2023.\n\nThe property was listed in July for $6.5 million. Sale records that might identify the buyers are not yet available.\nRadnay has another Kenilworth listing, a lakeshore property on Sheridan Road,\nasking $15 million that is under contract\n. That asking price would break the village record for a lakefront property of $11.75 million set in 2020, but the final sale price is not yet known. Radnay said she expects the deal to close by the end of the year.\nIn September, a lakefront Kenilworth mansion that was expected to be a teardown\nsold for $6.8 million\nto developer Leo Birov of Heritage Luxury Homes. Birov is\nmarketing a $6 million spec\nmansion on part of the site, and it\u2019s likely another new construction is in the works for the other portion of the property.\nThe recent sales show the hot streak for North Shore luxury properties isn\u2019t slowing down.\nA few dozen homes have sold for more than $4 million along the North Shore this year,\nwith Winnetka leading the pack in luxury deals\n. A 13,900 square-foot mansion previously owned by a former Goldman Sachs executive \u2014 also listed by Radnay \u2014\nsold in September for $31.3 million\n, the highest Chicagoland home resale price ever recorded.\nThe lack of inventory is driving competition, Radnay said.\nLike the house on Cumberland Avenue, many luxury properties that recently sold or have pending contracts in the North Shore have gone under contract in a matter of weeks, in some cases within a few days.\n\u201cUntil our inventory changes, we\u2019re going to be staying at this exact same temperature for a while,\u201d Radnay said.\n",

        "content": "In the latest land grab of the AI infrastructure boom, a\nNvidia-backed\nstartup is joining forces with cloud computing heavyweight CoreWeave to build a sprawling, self-powered data center complex in West Texas.\nPoolside, an AI company focused on next-gen code generation, plans to construct the 500-acre facility \u2014 dubbed Horizon \u2014 on a portion of the Mitchell family\u2019s Longfellow Ranch, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n.\nThe site sits atop the Permian Basin, America\u2019s busiest oil field, and will use natural gas produced on-site to power the operation, a growing trend among AI firms seeking more control over their infrastructure amid soaring demand and constrained chip supply.\nThe Horizon project lands amid consolidation across the data-center sector.\nPlano-based Aligned Data Centers, which operates 50 campuses across the Americas, was recently sold to a BlackRock- and Nvidia-backed consortium in a\n$40 billion deal\n, one of the largest in the industry\u2019s history, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nPoolside and\nCoreWeave\nplan to build a data center capable of generating its own electricity, an unusual move in a sector where power access has become a critical choke point.\n\nAnother emerging player in West Texas, Rick Perry\u2019s\nFermi\nReal Estate Investment Trust signature project, \u201cProject Matador,\u201d is a 5,000-acre advanced energy and intelligence campus aiming to attract data center and hyperscaler tenants, with plans for 11 gigawatts of power by 2038 from natural gas, solar and nuclear sources on land leased from Texas Tech University.\nCoreWeave will anchor the first 250 megawatts of capacity at Horizon, expected to come online late next year, with room to expand another 500 megawatts.\nHorizon\u2019s on-site power generation is designed to mitigate grid constraints that have slowed other data-center projects in Texas, where energy regulators are now empowered to throttle big users during shortages.\nPoolside co-founder Eiso Kant said the ability to deploy infrastructure quickly is now \u201cthe real physical bottleneck\u201d in AI development. Modular construction methods and proximity to energy sources are meant to cut costs and speed delivery; a 2-gigawatt build would normally cost about $16 billion, not counting Nvidia\u2019s advanced chips.\nPoolside is also in a $2 billion fundraising round that would value the company at $14 billion, up from $3 billion last year. It\u2019s among a cluster of well-funded AI upstarts \u2014 including Elon Musk\u2019s xAI and OpenAI \u2014 that are racing to secure computing at unprecedented scale.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "KPG Funds\nhas lost control of its Greenwich Village office redevelopment after its lender took over the leasehold on the property.\nThorofare, through an entity tied to its REIT, acquired the 99-year ground lease at\n132 West 14th Street\nin a deal valued at $27.7 million, property records show. The deal marks the end of a troubled chapter for KPG, which had ambitious plans to convert the aging, seven-story building into a boutique Class A office and retail property.\nKPG signed the long-term ground lease with the owner, The Salvation Army, in 2021 for $22.1 million, and a year later secured a $34.5 million construction loan from Thorofare for an overhaul estimated to cost $55 million.\nThe redevelopment of the property, once dubbed the \u201cworld\u2019s ugliest building,\u201d called for demolition of the front and rear facades, along with the addition of new steel structures. The project was nearing completion but had yet to receive a new certificate of occupancy, according to\nPincusCo\n, which first reported on the acquisition.\n\nThe building, located between Sixth and Seventh avenues, was marketed earlier this year by a JLL team with an asking price of roughly $50 million. But financial strain soon followed. In June, the Salvation Army filed a nonpayment case in Manhattan housing court, alleging KPG had failed to pay two quarters\u2019 worth of ground rent totaling $162,500. The court issued a default judgment in favor of the Salvation Army in August, paving the way for Thorofare to step in.\nThe lender\u2019s move to assume control is a familiar one in today\u2019s tightening office market, where rising interest rates and leasing headwinds have squeezed even well-capitalized developers. KPG, led by\nGregory Kraut\nand Rod Kritsberg, bet on the NYC office market as other landlords began defaulting and handing over keys.\nKPG sought to convert aging Class B and Class C buildings into high-end boutique offices. It focused on areas such as Soho, Tribeca and Greenwich Village, where office supply is limited. But the firm has faced mounting challenges as demand for new office space remains uneven across the city.\nRepresentatives for Thorofare and KPG did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",

Keith Kurland and Michael Diaz with Walker &amp; Dunlap arranged the refinancing on Terra\u2019s behalf.\nThe mortgage replaces a $127 million loan provided by an affiliate of MF1 Capital last year, the statement said.\nIn 2023, Coconut Grove-based\nTerra\n, led by David Martin, and Miami-based New Valley, led by Howard Lober, completed Natura Gardens, a garden-style complex that consists of 12 three-story buildings, records show. The project offers a mix of one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments ranging from 727 square feet to 1,476 square feet. Monthly rents range from $2,125 to $4,851, according to Apartments.com.\n\nIn 2021, the joint venture secured a\n$64.8 million\nconstruction loan from Bank OZK to build Natura Gardens. Terra and New Valley had originally planned a much larger mixed-use development for the 72-acre site they acquired for $52 million from Prologis in 2019.\nIn 2021, before construction began on Natura Gardens, Terra and New Valley sold 45 acres for $53.5 million to Butters Group and Greystar, which are planning 500,000 square feet of industrial space and a 360-unit multifamily community.\nThe Natura Gardens refinancing follows a series of major loan closings across Terra\u2019s portfolio. In January, the firm secured a\n$291 million\nloan for its CentroCity, a mixed-use development with 470 apartments in Miami. Last year, Terra and Grass River obtained a\n$245 million\nrefinancing for their Grove Central mixed-use project in Coconut Grove.\nRecently, Terra offered to purchase and overhaul the 70-year-old Miami Seaquarium on Virginia Key into a modern, marine life\u2013free aquarium and education campus. The planned\n$22.5 million\nacquisition will preserve the site\u2019s signature dome and add new retail, dining, a marina and green public spaces.\nThe deal has to clear a couple of hurdles. First, a bankruptcy judge in Delaware has to sign off on the sale of the lease and is expected to rule on it on Friday. Should the judge approve the transfer, Terra would also need to obtain final approval from Miami-Dade County, which owns the land underneath Miami Seaquarium.",

        "content": "A proptech startup has entered the chat on private listings, offering a possible alternative to pocket listings in the Texas luxury market.\nAs real estate heavy hitters Compass, Zillow and the National Association of Realtors duke it out over the legality of private listings, Dayton, Ohio-based Unlisted has created a product that turns the whisper network of off-market listings into an app.\nThe Waitlist is a platform that lets homeowners gauge buyer interest before listing. The web app, which will eventually be available on iOS as well, lets window shoppers express interest in homes before their owners are ready to sell. Homeowners can respond to users on their waitlist, and its profit model sells real estate agents the chance to own zip codes on its website.\nThe goal is to create Waitlist profiles for every home in the country, using property descriptions generated automatically and public record data purchased from ATTOM. Since the app launched on June 18, 7,000 homes, worth an estimated $5 billion, have generated waitlists.\nReal estate agents can buy zip codes in the Unlisted system, assuming the title of Local Expert and attaching their information to every home profile in the area. Only one agent is selected per zip code, and most of them so far are Sotheby\u2019s International Realty professionals.\nJB Hayes, a Briggs Freeman Sotheby\u2019s agent who\u2019s bought five zip codes throughout Dallas, is betting on Unlisted to become a springboard for off-market transactions.\n\u201cBefore, people would share off-markets with their colleagues that are in other brokerages, or people they\u2019ve done deals with, but that\u2019s illegal marketing now,\u201d Hayes said.\nShe\u2019s referring to the nationwide dispute over the National Association of Realtors\u2019 Clear Cooperation Policy, a rule that requires listing agents to put a property on the local MLS within one day of marketing it for sale. Zillow has lent its considerable muscle to enforcing the rule,\ninterpreting yard signs and social media posts as public marketing\n.\nNAR and Zillow are challenging Compass, which has pioneered private exclusive listings on a systematic scale. In addition, Compass has inspired firms like\nDouglas Elliman, Corcoran\nand\nColdwell Banker\nto prove NAR\u2019s rule.\n\nBut Unlisted founder Katie Hill insists The Waitlist isn\u2019t a shopping platform, and it isn\u2019t meant to facilitate off-market sales.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the vision right now. We want to be a readiness site, not a listing site,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThe entire industry as we know it competes in listings; nobody competes in folks who are not for sale.\u201d\nEffective November, homeowners on the site can authorize agents to update their property profiles.\nThe app could be particularly useful in Austin, where high property taxes and no mandatory sales price disclosure generate a strong preference for privacy among luxury buyers and sellers for whom it\u2019s more profitable to avoid a flashy price tag.\nBecause private sales keep local appraisers in the dark about the true price of a property,\nit\u2019s all but conventional for homes above $10 million to avoid the Austin MLS altogether\n, according to Jeanne and Julie Residential Group, an Austin luxury team.\n\u201cAustin is an anomaly. California puts everything on MLS, everything. And Dallas and Houston put pretty much everything on MLS. So Austin\u2019s really kind of an anomaly in the country,\u201d Jeanne Parker said.\nA dwindling buyer pool in Austin is driving more Austin ultra-luxury sellers to the open market this year, according to the team. However, as long as there are wealthy buyers and sellers who want privacy more than a top-dollar offer, there will be a demand for private listings.\n\u201cPeople get the most exposure when you promote and market and list. That is definitely the best way to go, because you\u2019re going to drive up the price, and there\u2019s more people that are going to get their eyeballs on it. There are some people that just don\u2019t care,\u201d Hayes said.\n\u201cThey get the price they want, they\u2019re going to be happy. So why go through all the hoops to make the house show-ready?\u201d\n",

The deal for the property at 215 West 14th Street works out to $322,665 per unit.\nJade Enterprises developed the complex in 2023 and sold it to HACLA with the representation of JLL\u2019s Blake Rogers. The housing authority acquired the property with funding from\nCity National Bank\nand hopes to secure even more financing next year.\nHACLA plans to restrict 24 percent of the units in the building to households earning between 30 and 60 percent of the area median income. In Los Angeles County, for one person, that would be an\nannual income\nof between $31,800 and $63,600, or between $45,450 and $90,900 for a household of four.\nThe Emerald Apartments will undergo a revamp under HACLA\u2019s supervision. The agency, one of the country\u2019s oldest public housing authorities, plans to add six\naccessory dwelling units\nand 2,400 square feet of retail space to the property in the coming months.\n\nThe complex includes a mix of studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom units and amenities including a pool, gym, community room and structured parking deck. The affordable housing restrictions will go into effect as units turn over, thereby preventing tenants from being displaced.\n\u201cThe Emerald acquisition is about protecting our neighborhoods and ensuring working-class Angelenos have access to safe, stable and affordable housing,\u201d L.A. City Councilmember\nYsabel Jurado\nsaid\nin a statement. \u201cBy preserving affordability in existing communities, we are keeping families together, preventing displacement and building a Los Angeles where every family can thrive.\u201d\nHACLA owns about 160 properties across Los Angeles providing housing to more than 212,000 people.

        "content": "A pair of creekside medical office buildings in Marin County sold for more than $24 million last month, according to public records.\nBay Area-based Wareham Development Corporation sold the two offices at 2 and 18 Bon Air Road in Larkspur to Anchor Health Properties, a Charlottesville, Virginia-based real estate investment trust, for $24.1 million.\nMarinHealth leases both buildings for specialty outpatient services. At a combined 27,300 square feet, they fit into a larger constellation of medical offices in the area, which includes a regional hospital. Marin Health is under lease until 2031.\nSan Rafael-based Wareham Development, which is known for its focus in developing life science buildings, had owned the properties for decades.\nThe building at 2 Bon Air Road was once a Safeway grocery store, which Wareham renovated into a large medical office in 1991.\nThe second building, across a parking lot at 18 Bon Air Road, had been a fast food restaurant before Wareham\u2019s redevelopment into an outpatient facility in 2004.\nCaroline Reynolds of JLL said the $881-per-square-foot price was high but ultimately incomparable to other North Bay office sales as the buildings represent \u201chighly specialized\u201d outpatient facilities.\nA source close to the deal told\nThe Real Deal\nthat the location had much to do with Wareham\u2019s motivation to sell.\n\nStarted by Rich Robbins in 1977, Wareham Development\u2019s portfolio dots the Bay Area, but the main hub sits in the East Bay, with large research campuses in Berkeley and Emeryville. The source said Marin County, where Wareham has one other property, stretched the company\u2019s orbit too far.\nWareham Development partner James Goddard said the sale would provide revenue to reinvest into the firm\u2019s other Bay Area campuses.\n\u201cThis was an asset that we had owned for many decades. As our portfolio has grown and expanded, it became a geographically isolated project,\u201d Goddard said. \u201cNow was an opportune time to sell and reinvest the funds into our large format campus locations in the East Bay and in the Stanford Research Park in Palo Alto.\u201d\nThe company\nmade headlines\nin February when it announced plans to sell Berkeley\u2019s historic Fantasy Studios.\nKnown as \u201cThe House that Creedence Built,\u201d the more than 121,000-square-foot complex had hosted recording studios where bands such Creedence Clearwater Revival, Santana, Joan Baez and Green Day all cut records. The studios closed in 2018.\nRobbins, who owned the buildings since 2007, had planned to turn the property into a life sciences research lab, but ditched those plans.\nAnchor Health Properties did not return requests for comment. The Virginia-based company owns and manages 150 healthcare facilities across the country, including a maternal care facility in Burlingame, leased by Sutter Health.\n",

That entity sued to foreclose, accusing Jacobowitz\u2019s firm of blocking access to the property, neglecting maintenance, and failing to share financial records.\nThe landlord disputes the allegations, calling them \u201cbogus non-monetary defaults\u201d and claiming the lender turned aggressive soon after acquiring the note. While property taxes have since been paid, the lender\u2019s attorney, Houston-based Sanford Dow, said the building is in disrepair, citing broken windows and water damage.\n\n\u201cBBI had a sweetheart deal and couldn\u2019t get out of their own way,\u201d Dow said in an email to the outlet, describing the bankruptcy as an effort to stall foreclosure.\nThe bankruptcy filing temporarily halted foreclosure proceedings and a separate lawsuit while the court considers next steps. A hearing is scheduled for Nov. 13. In court documents, the landlord said it has a contract to sell the building for $35 million, with closing set for this Friday \u2014 a deal that would require court approval.\nOnce envisioned as a marquee residential conversion that could anchor downtown Houston\u2019s post-pandemic rebound, 800 Bell is now emblematic of the city\u2019s office-to-housing struggle.\nThe 1962 tower \u2014 briefly the tallest west of the Mississippi \u2014 was added to the National Register of Historic Places this year \u2014 a designation that could aid future redevelopment but hasn\u2019t yet saved it from financial freefall.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "After\nMerchants Bank\nmade loans to a group of troubled investors, the scope of its losses is coming into view, as companies tied to one of their borrowers, imprisoned investor Moshe Silber, go through bankruptcy.\nThe Carmel, Indiana-based regional bank, which became a go-to lender for multifamily landlords across the U.S.,\nannounced\nlast quarter that some of its borrowers were under investigation for mortgage fraud, leading to $46.1 million in write-downs.\nNew court filings reveal the bank\u2019s exposure to Moshe Silber, who was sentenced to 30 months in prison. In Silber and his co-conspirators scheme, they allegedly used a stolen identity to obtain an inflated\n$74 million loan\non a Cincinnati apartment complex.\nThe investigation into Silber was part of a broader effort by the Department of Justice and the Federal Home Finance Agency to weed out commercial mortgage fraud.\nMerchants Bank provided loans to at least seven of Silber\u2019s multifamily properties. Merchants claims it is owed over $61 million on the loans backed by properties in Flint, Michigan; Danville, Virginia; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\nMerchants claims in court filings the Silber-linked entities abandoned the properties in 2024, leading the bank to cover the operating shortfalls at the properties. Merchants then appointed receivers who put the properties up for sale. The properties have either received letters of intent from buyers or are under contract to be sold.\nThe proposed sale prices suggest Merchants will take large losses.\nNotably, Merchants claims it has a binding letter of intent to sell the 365-unit Midway Townhomes in Flint, Michigan, for just $1.5 million, according to court filings. It\u2019s unclear how much Silber paid for the property, but in 2023, Merchants provided a $21.6 million loan on it, and the new sale price would mark a 93 percent decrease from the loan.\nOther Silber-linked properties had higher offers, but they were still below the underlying loans on the property. The Woodside Village in Dannville, Virginia, which was recently hit by 17 building code violations by the city, had a sale in place for $10 million, according to Merchants\u2019 court filings. Merchants initially provided $10.5 million in loans on the multifamily property.\nBut final prices could be even lower.\n\nBecause of the bankruptcy, Merchants alleges a buyer could swoop in with debtor-in-possession financing and a stalking horse bid and pay even less. Merchants alleges the debtor\u2019s proposed use of $22 million in DIP financing, or a loan to sustain operations during the bankruptcy process, is giving the DIP lender an unfair advantage. The DIP financing will be provided by an affiliate of entrepreneur Daryl Hagler, who Merchants claims will have credit-bid rights. In other words, the DIP lender could buy the properties using its existing debt for less than what Merchants would obtain in its ongoing sales process of the properties.\nIt is clear that Merchants is expecting to take a hit on the Silber portfolio. But it is unclear how those losses will appear on its balance sheet.\nAt least some of Silber\u2019s loans appear to be securitized as part of a larger private securitization, according to Merchants\u2019 legal filings. Merchants has completed billions of dollars of private securitizations. The bank claims these vehicles minimize its risk by offloading loans to outside investors and allowing the bank to lend more. Usually, however, a bank has to assume the loan if a borrower commits fraud.\nMerchants\u2019 latest court filings are part of a larger bankruptcy related to Silber\u2019s former companies CBRM and Crown Capital. After Silber pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution, a fiduciary was appointed to oversee his multifamily portfolio. San Antonio-based Lynd Group was tapped to manage the properties.\nThe fiduciary put CBRM and Crown Capital into bankruptcy in May after a creditor sought to sell CBRM, a company controlling over 6,000 multifamily units, at an auction in Rockland County.\nThat\u2019s when the troubled financial picture of Silber\u2019s portfolio emerged. An attorney for CBRM claimed Silber could have extracted hundreds of millions from his properties for his own benefit, since the company Crown Capital had secured $200 million in bond financing in addition to $450 million in property-level mortgages. Many of Silber\u2019s properties were in disrepair at the time of the bankruptcy.\nEarlier this month, the fiduciary, Elizabeth LaPuma, put additional 42 companies tied to 19 properties owned by Silber into bankruptcy.\nMerchants, which is the senior lender on seven of the 19 properties, pushed back on the bankruptcy.\nA spokesperson for Merchants declined to comment.\n",

The property was recently appraised at 21 percent less than it was in 2019.\nThe Plaza District building, located between East 59th and 60th Streets, is a 28-story office and retail building totaling 595,000 square feet. It was purchased by a group of investors \u2014 including Vornado, Oxford Properties Group and the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System \u2014 in 2013 for about $1.3 billion.\nThe owners secured a $214 million refinancing for the property in 2019. But revenue and occupancy have both taken a hit since then. Occupancy was 97 percent when the loan was issued. But Ralph Lauren, which once leased over 40 percent of the space in the building,\ndownsized\nby 39 percent and is\nnow paying\nabout 30 percent less in rent. Occupancy dipped to 57 percent in 2024, according to Morningstar, but is now back up to 74 percent.\nBeyond Ralph Lauren, current office tenants include Lakewood Capital, according to Vornado\u2019s website, with retail space occupied by Celine, Moncler, Balmain, Cremieux, Tod\u2019s and others.\n\nRevenue last year was $69.9 million, down from $87.3 million in 2019.\nAt its most recent appraisal, the property also saw its value fall. Once estimated to be worth $1.21 billion, 650 Madison was appraised at $950 million.\nThe loan was transferred to special servicing after the borrower failed to fund a \u201cwaterfall shortfall,\u201d a type of investment distribution. The borrower formally requested the transfer, according to information from the lender provided by Morningstar.\nThe lender said it\u2019s in discussions with the borrower and evaluating all available legal and resolution options, including a loan sale and foreclosure. A pre-negotiation agreement has already been signed.\nVornado did not respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "We are all pro-housing here, ok?\nWhenever someone says they know New York City needs more housing, wait for the \u201cbut.\u201d\nConsider the\nlawsuit\nbrought by members of the City Council\u2019s Common Sense Caucus last month. The complaint argued that while the members don\u2019t oppose increasing the city\u2019s housing stock, three measures that will appear on the\nNovember ballot\n\u2014 aimed at streamlining housing construction \u2014 mislead voters.\nState Supreme Court Judge Jeffrey Pearlman on Wednesday denied the group\u2019s petition, which asked the court to void the questions until an environmental review of the potential impact of the proposals is completed. The Common Sense Caucus plans to appeal the decision, an attorney confirmed.\nCity Council leaders have separately argued that the ballot questions are deceptive and dangerous. And when they talk about the measures, they invariably emphasize that their opposition to the proposals isn\u2019t an objection to ramping up housing construction.\n\u201cYes, we know we have to build housing, but what about investing in our schools? What about investing in our parks, the streets, the roads? What about adding economic opportunity?\u201d Council member Kevin Riley, who chairs the Council\u2019s Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises, said at a rally last week. \u201cThis gives us the opportunity to negotiate with those coming in our community for the things that we need in our community to grow.\u201d\nThe City Council\u2019s \u201cbut\u201d is that the ballot proposals strip away members\u2019 ability to fight for funding and other benefits for their communities. The Council is effectively the last stop and most consequential part of the city\u2019s land use review process. The body tends to vote according to the wishes of the local Council member, giving that member leverage to squeeze concessions out of developers, funding out of the administration and guarantees that a project will be built using union labor.\nOn Wednesday, Comptroller Brad Lander, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine spoke at a rally to support the ballot measures. (Lander spoke for only a few seconds before climate protestors emerged from the crowd behind him with signs reading \u201cBlackRock Brad\u201d and \u201cKeep Your Word.\u201d The protestors have\nshown up\nat other events, calling on Lander to divest the city\u2019s funds from BlackRock.)\nReynoso acknowledged that when he was a Council member, he loved member deference, the tradition of the City Council deferring to the local member on land use matters. But he said some City Council members have lost their seats for supporting affordable housing projects. (He was perhaps alluding to Marjorie Vel\u00e1zquez, who\nlost her reelection bid\nafter supporting a Throggs Neck project.) Reynoso said this threat should be removed from members\u2019 calculus when considering affordable housing in their districts.\n\u201cMany Council members don\u2019t take the risk at all. They build no housing, especially affordable housing, in an effort to preserve their seat in the City Council,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are other members that put their necks on the line and support housing and don\u2019t get kicked out of their seats, but we shouldn\u2019t leave this up to chance. We shouldn\u2019t make this risky.\u201d\nAmit Singh Bagga, who is leading YES on Affordable Housing, a campaign that plans to spend $3 million on promoting the ballot questions, said that the current City Council has been approving housing at a faster pace than its predecessors. But that doesn\u2019t mean future Councils will follow suit.\n\u201cWe cannot rely on just one good speaker \u2026 to solve a structural problem that\u2019s been decades in the making,\u201d he said at Wednesday\u2019s rally.\nLast week, the City Council advanced the rezoning of Jamaica, Queens, which is projected to pave the way for nearly 12,000 new housing units in the district. As part of the Council\u2019s deal with the administration on the rezoning, City Hall\ncommitted\nto providing more than $400 million in funding for infrastructure and other improvements in the neighborhood.\nAt the time, Council Speaker Adrienne Adams pointed to the additional investments as another example of what is at stake in the fight over the ballot measures.\n\u201cWe have not only approved housing, but this Council has improved initial proposals by deepening the affordability of the homes that they will create while securing major investments for our neighborhoods,\u201d she said.\nBut the approval also shaved nearly 500 units from housing projections, because allowable density in some parts of the rezoning area was reduced and some areas were removed from the rezoning entirely. Council members explained that the changes were aimed at creating a smoother transition from higher-density downtown to the occupied homes to the south.\nCrain\u2019s reports that the Council has also been distributing talking points to community boards, emphasizing the danger to single- and two-family homes posed by the ballot questions. The thinking goes that the measures will make it easier for multifamily buildings to be constructed in areas dominated by single- and two-family homes. The PowerPoint distributed to the community boards, per Crain\u2019s, indicates that one of the ballot questions \u201ceffectively eliminates 1- and 2-family home zoning in NYC.\u201d (The ballot questions do not, on their own, change zoning.)\n\nSuch concerns were also prevalent among opponents to the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity. Before passing the text amendment, the City Council made\nchanges\nthat largely excluded such neighborhoods from transit-oriented and town center development.\nIt is an interesting thought experiment to imagine what the conversations about these measures would have been had they taken place 10 years ago. For one thing, the preamble to criticism would not be: \u201cOf course to solve the housing crisis we need more housing.\u201d\nI doubt, though, many would object to question 5, which asks if the city should drag the city map into the 21st Century.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nYonkers Mayor Mike Spano is calling on Gov. Kathy Hochul to investigate the reasons MGM Resorts dropped its bid for a casino license for its facility in the city. In a post on Instagram, Spano said the decision to pull out of the competition \u201cdefies all logic\u201d and is \u201cnothing short of a betrayal to the people of Yonkers and Westchester County.\u201d He also pointed to the fact that President Donald Trump stands to benefit from Bally\u2019s receiving a license for its golf course in the Bronx. As part of its agreement to take over the golf course lease from Trump, Bally\u2019s agreed to pay Trump $115 million if it snags one of the casino licenses. Why did MGM drop its plans for a full-fledged casino at its Yonkers facility, and can the existing slot parlor survive without a license? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nA 2022 study found that Hart Island, a 101-acre public cemetery in Pelham Bay between the Bronx and Long Island, will run out of suitable burial space in eight to 12 years. City Council committees are holding a joint oversight hearing on the island\u2019s future on Thursday.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Billionaire hedge fund investor Bill Ackman gave $1 million to Defend NYC, an anti-Zohran Mamdani super PAC,\nPolitico New York reports\n. Ackman previously gave Fix the City, a super PAC backing Andrew Cuomo, $500,000.\n\u2014 While three candidates vie for the top job at City Hall, Mayor Eric Adams says he has his pick of three \u201cdream jobs.\u201d During an appearance on \u201cThe Reset Talk Show,\u201d Adams said he\u2019s looking at three job offers, according to\nthe New York Daily News\n.\n\u2014 Even legalese needs a human touch. A state judge on Wednesday slammed residents of public housing in Chelsea for filing a lawsuit using AI,\nCrain\u2019s reports\n. The lawsuit, which is seeking to prevent the city from demolishing the Fulton and Elliott-Chelsea houses, was written by the AI chatbot Grok and cited legal filings that don\u2019t exist. The judge called the lawsuit \u201cgarbage\u201d and threatened to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice. The residents have since hired an attorney, who said his clients were \u201cunfamiliar with the dangers\u201d of relying on AI.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$8.5 million\nfor a 7,000-square-foot townhouse at 330 West 88th Street on the Upper West Side. Jaime Richichi with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$510 million\nfor a 10-story commercial building at 1334 York Avenue in Lenox Hill. Sotheby\u2019s sold its New York headquarters to Cornell University.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$24 million\nfor a 10-room co-op at The Dakota, 1 West 72nd Street on the Upper West Side. John Burger with Brown Harris Stevens has the listing.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "Howard Hanna has officially planted its flag in Manhattan.\nOne of the nation\u2019s largest brokerages announced on Thursday that it acquired Elegran Real Estate, the 17-year-old firm founded by CEO Michael Rossi. Under its new ownership, the company, headquartered in Midtown, will be referred to as Howard Hanna Elegran.\nHoward Hanna has been expanding in the outer boroughs and New York City suburbs in recent years as it evaluated opportunities to set up shop in Manhattan, according to Howard Hanna CEO Hoby Hanna.\nElegran \u2014 which placed 15th in\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nlatest ranking\nof the top brokerages in Manhattan with $118 million in sales \u2014 was \u201ca great company to give us entr\u00e9e and use as a springboard,\u201d said Hanna.\nHanna added that he and Rossi had discussed joining forces a few years ago, but the \u201ctiming wasn\u2019t right for either of us.\u201d Rossi then circled back in the spring, \u201cand here we are today,\u201d he said.\nA spokesperson for Elegran declined to share additional details about the acquisition, including the purchase price, citing a confidential agreement.\nThe company\u2019s existing New York City offices include a location in the Bronx and in Queens. Howard Hanna acquired a Long Island-based firm, Coach Realtors, in 2023, and under their combined umbrella, expanded to Astoria through the acquisition of Marquee Realty.\nElegran\u2019s 157 agents will join Howard Hanna\u2019s network of 3,500 agents across the tri-state area. The firm launched operations in New York state a decade ago and has since become its largest in agent headcount and number of transactions, according to a press release.\nRossi will remain on board with the company as an executive vice president with a focus on growth and development in New York City. He\u2019ll be working alongside Matt Rand, the firm\u2019s regional president.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very tough, post-class action lawsuits and the FARE Act, to be an independent firm and thrive in this market,\u201d Rossi said.\n\nHe added that the \u201ctiming was perfect\u201d considering the wave of consolidation in the industry, which hit a peak last month when Compass and Anywhere Real Estate announced a\nseismic merger deal\nexpected to close next year.\n\u201cI wish I knew that the Compass news was happening,\u201d Rossi said.\u201dThat would have made me the smartest guy in the world.\u201d\nBoth Rossi and Hanna billed increased consolidation as an advantage for the privately-held company, which Hanna described as \u201cnimble\u201d and a \u201cgood attraction point for agents and brokerages that are looking for that flexibility, as opposed to big corporate philosophies.\u201d\n\u201cThe consumer really needs a choice,\u201d Rossi said. \u201cIt\u2019s like Pepsi and Coke in the refrigerator.\u201d\nNews of the acquisition comes after Elegran ended its licensing agreement with Forbes Global Properties earlier this year, sparking rumors of a potential takeover that eventually pegged Howard Hanna as the likely frontrunner months ahead of the official announcement.\nRossi confirmed through a spokesperson in June that the brokerage was no longer part of the Forbes network and that it was working on a \u201cnew collaboration,\u201d though he declined to share more details at the time.\nRossi said the \u201cwhispering\u201d was because \u201cwe kept agents abreast of the conversations we were having and the direction we were thinking of going.\u201d\nSeveral agents have left Elegran over the last few months, including its managing director Jared Antin, who joined Brown Harris Stevens as an executive director in July. The following month, two other teams, the Asset Advisory Team and the Waterview Advisory Group, also left Elegran to join Coldwell Banker Warburg.\nNews of the agents\u2019 departure \u201cmade it seem like we lost a lot of people,\u201d Rossi said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve only lost three revenue-generating agents who were incentivized to bring over non-producing agents to Coldwell Banker.\u201d\n\u201cDuring a time of transition, our retention has been industry standard,\u201d Rossi said. \u201cActually, given the transition, our retention\u2019s been incredible. No one likes change.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The Chicago Bears\u2019 push for a\ntaxpayer-assisted stadium\nin Arlington Heights is running into sustained headwinds in Springfield.\nA proposal from state Rep. Kam Buckner, D-Chicago, would require public review, economic reporting and potential repayment of subsidies for any major stadium deal \u2014 a move aimed squarely at the Bears\u2019 $5 billion plan for a domed stadium and mixed-use campus on the site of the former Arlington International Racecourse, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe measure would mandate that any local or state agreement offering financial incentives for a professional sports venue be posted publicly for 30 days, followed by at least two public hearings and an independent cost-benefit study from the state\u2019s Commission on Government Forecasting &amp; Accountability.\nThe Bears would need to file annual reports on job creation and tax revenue, and if they relocate before the deal expires, they\u2019d have to repay subsidies with interest and make local schools, libraries and public safety agencies whole for lost property-tax revenue.\nBuckner, one of the Bears\u2019 most vocal critics in the legislature, said his proposal is designed to prevent fast-tracked stadium legislation.\n\u201cWe have an opportunity to change the way we do stadium financing in this state for the long term,\u201d Buckner told the outlet.\nThe Bears are lobbying lawmakers during the General Assembly\u2019s fall veto session for approval to negotiate a long-term property tax break via \u201cmega project\u201d legislation.\n\nThat plan would allow developers investing at least $500 million to freeze property taxes for decades, paying instead through negotiated payments in lieu of taxes. The team argues such certainty is vital as construction costs rise by roughly $10 million a month.\nDespite pledging to privately finance the stadium, the team has sought roughly\n$855 million\nin infrastructure support for roads, transit and utilities connecting the 326-acre site to surrounding suburbs.\nThe proposal has drawn little enthusiasm in Springfield, where Governor JB Pritzker has said the Bears should pay the\n$534 million\nstill owed on Soldier Field\u2019s 2003 renovation before seeking new public assistance.\nBuckner conceded his bill is unlikely to pass during this veto session but said he hopes it sparks a broader debate about accountability in public-private stadium deals.\n\u201cTeams pit\ncities\nand states against each other,\u201d he said. \u201cThey make a deal today, then a decade later, they leave \u2014 and taxpayers are left holding the bag.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The Weeknd closed on a waterfront mansion in gated Gables Estates for $50 million, making it the most expensive home ever sold in Coral Gables.\nBrokers confirmed that the sale of the estate at 41 Arvida Parkway closed for $50 million, although the deed has not yet appeared in public records.\nThe Real Deal\nreported earlier this month that The Weeknd, whose legal name is Abel Makkonen Tesfaye, was\nin contract\non the $54.9 million listing.\nEddy Martinez and Roland Ortiz of One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty had the listing, and Ortiz brought the buyer. They declined to comment on the identities of the buyer and seller.\nThe Weeknd, a Canadian-born four-time Grammy winner, performed at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2021, and created and starred in the HBO show \u201cThe Idol\u201d alongside Lily-Rose Depp in 2023. In 2021, he bought a mansion in Los Angeles\u2019 Bel Air neighborhood for\n$70 million\n.\n\nThe seller of the 1.2-acre Gables Estates property is oil recycling mogul Steven Lempera, who bought it at auction in 2019 for $25.5 million. Records show the nearly 19,000-square-foot mansion was built in 2018. It includes eight bedrooms, nine bathrooms, two half-bathrooms, a pool and a dock.\nLempera listed it for $49.9 million in 2020, and proceeded to remove and relist the property at varying prices for five years. It last hit the market for $54.9 million in June, and the estate\nwent pending\nin September, Redfin shows.\nIt tops the\nprevious price record\nin Coral Gables, set by the 2022 sale of 650 Casuarina Concourse for $45.3 million. The buyer was a Delaware entity linked to billionaire Citadel founder Ken Griffin, and it was one of the tri-county region\u2019s most expensive sales that year.\nSince the pandemic triggered an unprecedented wealth migration to South Florida, record deals in the most in-demand neighborhoods have become the norm. Earlier this month, Barstool Sports founder\nDave Portnoy paid a record $27.8 million\nfor a waterfront Islamorada mansion in the Florida Keys.\n",

        "content": "Imagine if after legalizing marijuana, lawmakers had learned that no new people had started smoking it. Would they have been disappointed? Would they have scheduled a hearing to figure out how to get more people stoned?\nThis is happening with rent stabilization.\nExcept in Kingston, price controls for apartments have not been adopted upstate, six years after the state legislature made that possible. This has upset Assembly members who love rent stabilization, especially Sarahana Shrestha and Linda Rosenthal.\nTo find out why, Rosenthal has\nscheduled a hearing\n, the Times Union reported.\nI\u2019m not here to tell you rent control is all bad. Like cannabis, it has benefits and drawbacks. My opinion, and that of nearly all economists, is that the drawbacks of price controls for housing outweigh the benefits \u2014 by a lot.\nFor that reason, rent control began in New York City as a temporary measure to be dropped when the city\u2019s housing emergency \u2014 defined as a sub-5 percent vacancy rate \u2014 was over.\nUnfortunately, it proved to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The policy\u2019s winners became such a powerful constituency that politicians perpetuated the housing emergency rather than end it by allowing lots of new housing. Ever since, the winners (tenants in nice, low-rent units) have been prospering at the expense of the losers (everyone else).\nBut upstate localities just haven\u2019t been able to get their housing emergencies started. Hence, no rent stabilization. Bummer!\nIt must suck to live without a housing emergency. Every time you need to find a new place, there are enough rentals available that landlords have to compete for your business. Terrible, I know.\n\nCompare that to New York City, where the vacancy rate was last measured at a minuscule 1.4 percent \u2014 a triumph of 50 years of rent stabilization. In the city, apartment hunting is a true challenge, as it should be.\nIt wouldn\u2019t seem right if New Yorkers could rent an apartment as easily as buying a TV, with manufacturers and retailers improving their efficiency, technology and economies of scale to offer the best features and prices.\nInstead, finding a low-rent unit means reading the obituaries, building a network of sources and sending gift baskets to rental brokers to find out before anyone else if a rent-stabilized unit is becoming available. Fail, and you pay through the nose.\nExcept in New York City, Kingston and Nassau, Westchester and Rockland counties, all of which have rent stabilization (and high housing costs), New Yorkers are missing out on the excitement of finding that rare, inexpensive unit that comes with permanent lease renewals and succession rights.\nPerhaps the hearing that legislators are planning will yield some ways to make this happen.\nOne bill\n, which failed to pass last session, would create pathways to rent stabilization other than a low vacancy rate.\nGiven scarcity-inducing policies\u2019 success in making house-hunting a blood sport downstate, lawmakers could even apply them to areas beyond housing.\nFor example, they could ban jewelry stores and commercial mining. That way, New Yorkers seeking a wedding ring or anniversary gift would have to dig for gemstones or dive for pearl-bearing oysters.\nTeddy Roosevelt once said, \u201cNothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means\neffort, pain, difficulty\n.\u201d Affordable housing should be no exception.\n",

The bankruptcy case will be combined with an earlier one filed by Greco\u2019s wife, Linda.\nThe bankruptcy filing was first reported by\nPincusCo\n. A company owned by Greco with common creditors and ownership also filed for bankruptcy.\n\u201cI am a real estate developer by profession and I have enjoyed great success and great failure,\u201d Greco wrote in the filing. \u201cCurrently, my failures are now overcomplicating my life and require bankruptcy intervention.\u201d\nTo help dig out of the hole, Greco and his wife plan to sell a handful of condominium units at a building in Brooklyn Heights with a combined estimated value of $14 million.\n\nGreco is also looking to dodge a judgment in a lawsuit regarding\na project\nat 232-40 Smith Street, where North Hill Capital Management won a $30 million award in 2023. Two days before Greco filed for bankruptcy, a court filing said the lender could seize a 50 percent stake in the property and the limited liability company Greco owns it through.\nNorth Hill is the only secured creditor in a group of nearly 100 total creditors, which includes former business partners, banks and government entities, including the IRS.\nDespite the financial malaise, Greco doesn\u2019t seem fazed, telling Bisnow that \u201ccurrent projects will not be affected\u201d and new projects will be pursued following reorganization. Greco claims to have developed more than 100 projects, including 1 Grand Army Plaza in Prospect Park.\nAmong Greco\u2019s myriad problems are a handful of lawsuits filed by residents of a six-story condo building in Clinton Hill, where Greco is accused of fraud, self-dealing and a failure to deliver on promises. The AG\u2019s office is\ninvestigating\nthe building and Silver Point Capital recently foreclosed on it after a $35 million loan default.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The partners rebranded under Resident Group.\nThe refinancing is a Federal Housing Administration-insured loan secured through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to a JLL news release. The FHA-backed loans generally have fixed interest rates and a term of 35 to 40 years.\nJesse Wright and Joshua Odessky of JLL represented Resident Group.\nThe loan refinanced a\n$115 million\nfloating-rate bridge loan Metro Edgewater\u2019s developers scored in 2023, shortly after they completed the tower.\nMetro Edgewater is 94 percent leased, according to Carlos Ortiz of Building Block Realty.\n\nMonthly rents range from $2,868 to $5,475, according to\nApartments.com\n. The Metro Edgewater website shows expenses can run higher due to pet fees, parking fees, internet services and common area/clubhouse deposits.\nCamino Capital, based in Washington, D.C., is a family office led by CEO No\u00ebl Bejarano, according to Bejarano\u2019s LinkedIn. Building Block Realty is a Miami-based real estate and development consulting firm led by Ortiz, according to its website. Ortiz is founder of concrete shell contractor Prodesa International and manages its investment fund through Building Block Realty. Lujeni is based in Miami\u00a0 and is led by Daniel Rincon, state corporate records show. Korner is a Colombian real estate development firm.\nThe developers plan the 28-story second\nMetro Tower II\nat 3055 Northeast Fourth Avenue, adjacent to Metro Edgewater. As of last year, the plan was for the second tower to consist of 103 apartments and 60 hotel keys.\nSouth Florida\u2019s multifamily market is experiencing a supply overhang due to a\nrecord 18,600 apartments\nlast year, outpacing the 15,000 net new leases signed, according to CoStar Group data. This led to slower lease-ups and more concessions. A pandemic-era influx of out-of-staters prompted unprecedented demand and record rent growth, leading to the construction boom.\nIn other recent refinancings, Crescent Heights landed\n$238.4 million\nthis month for the 40-story, 588-unit Forma Miami luxury apartment tower at 2900 Biscayne Boulevard in Miami\u2019s Edgewater. Also this month, Treo Group scored a\n$132 million\nrefinancing for its Vox I and II student housing buildings with 262 units, combined, at 7025 and 7175 Southwest 59th Avenue in South Miami.\nIn August, Acre scored\n$72 million\nto refinance its 236-unit Adela at MiMo Bay apartment building at 6445 Northeast Seventh Avenue in Miami\u2019s MiMo Biscayne Boulevard Historic District.\n",

        "content": "Real estate business in Chicago\u2019s immigrant communities is becoming trickier as federal officials ramp up arrests with their crackdown in Chicago.\nFears around being targeted by immigration officials have created a cooling effect in Chicago\u2019s Hispanic and Latino communities, said Maria Kharot, president of Chicago\u2019s chapter of the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals. The fear extends beyond just undocumented immigrants, she said.\n\u201cA lot of people are not wanting to purchase, not wanting to buy, and they\u2019re just afraid,\u201d Kharot said. \u201cNot that they\u2019re undocumented. They\u2019re scared because they feel like they\u2019ve been profiled in general, regardless of their immigration status.\u201d\nThe Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday it had\narrested more than 1,500 people\nacross Illinois\nas part of what it dubbed \u201cOperation Midway Blitz.\u201d President Donald Trump and his administration said authorities are targeting dangerous criminals in the operations. In a statement to\nThe Real Deal\n, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the widespread immigration enforcement is making Chicago\u2019s neighborhoods safer.\n\u201cOur top enforcement priority is removing dangerous criminals from our streets, making our neighborhoods safer for everyone \u2014 including new potential home buyers,\u201d McLaughlin said.\nBut immigration activist groups have argued the arrests have been far broader, targeting day laborers, street vendors and people without criminal histories. The uncertainty has left many Chicago immigrants \u2014 both undocumented and those who have some legal protections \u2014 fearful that they could be swept up next, and that going through the process of buying or selling a home could raise unwanted scrutiny.\nMost undocumented immigrants in the U.S. live in mixed-status households, where a spouse, child or other family member has citizenship or lawful residence, according to 2024 Pew research. In other cases, immigrants have some documentation but may not be full permanent residents. They could be awaiting asylum hearings or other court dates to adjudicate their status.\n\u201cSometimes it may be one person in the household that is going through the process and they\u2019re waiting for their final approval. They don\u2019t want to risk it,\u201d Kharot said. \u201cThey\u2019re being intimidated.\u201d\nUnder the Trump administration, immigration officials have often asked an immigration judge to dismiss the case of asylum seekers at their court appearances, leaving them eligible for arrest and faster removal when they attend hearings.\nBrokers who work with Kharot\u2019s group have had clients pull out of the homebuying search or change their minds about selling because of concerns about the federal immigration crackdown, she said, and property showings in immigrant communities have dipped.\n\nFor brokers, the circumstances make the normally routine process of filing paperwork a trickier task, Kharot said. Non-citizens buying or selling homes often use different processes than citizens, so brokers need to know citizenship status to move the transaction along. Clients without legal status may be worried about offering that information.\n\u201cWe need to ask whether they are a citizen, what their immigration status is, but we have to build that level of trust,\u201d Kharot said. \u201cBecause if we don\u2019t ask that, we\u2019re not giving our clients the right service level.\u201d\nBeyond buying and selling real estate, the immigration crackdown has also impacted the labor market when it comes to construction and home contracting, Kharot said. She said an investor she\u2019s worked with had to put rehab projects on hold because their construction workers did not feel safe working on the site. About one-in-five construction workers in Chicago are foreign-born noncitizens, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\nSimilar concerns are playing\nout in Miami\nand\nLos Angeles\nas builders worry that lost labor from raids on job sites will increase costs and delay construction timelines.\nThe\nfederal spotlight on Chicago\nis also reigniting long-festering concerns about Chicago\u2019s safety. Trump has hammered on Chicago in public events and on social media, calling crime in the city \u201cout of control\u201d and branding the city a \u201cwar zone.\u201d\nNational Guard troops from Illinois and Texas were briefly deployed in early October before a court order restricted their deployment. The troops remain federalized and stationed in Illinois as the court process plays out.\nGrigory Pekarsky, managing broker of Vesta Preferred Realty, said he worries the heightened negative attention on Chicago will make people rethink buying property in the city. Already, he\u2019s seen some people drop out of the market because of the high tensions: one of the brokers on his team recently had a client cancel because of the National Guard deployment.\nShowing activity is still high citywide, but anecdotally, Pekarsky said buyers are less likely to make offers and commit to a property since federal intervention in the city has intensified.\n\u201cThe overall sluggishness or concern of making decisions with next steps is a lot more obvious right now,\u201d Pekarsky said. \u201cWhere people just have real hesitations of, how is it going to affect Chicago in general? It certainly is a slowdown.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A former partner of a top-producing team at Douglas Elliman is leaving the firm to join Serhant.\nGlenn Davis, who\nmerged his team\nwith Noble Black last year, is launching a new team with Ryan Serhant\u2019s eponymous brokerage. He\u2019s bringing seven agents with him to form the cohort, known as the New York Collaborative Team.\n\u201cI\u2019ve contemplated working with Ryan for years. We came up in the industry together,\u201d said Davis. \u201cRyan\u2019s platform is just compelling to me because there is opportunity, and there is growth. That\u2019s something that at this point in my career, I want to be on the ground level of.\u201d\nDavis added that he has \u201cnothing bad to say about Elliman\u201d and commended its leadership and CEO Michael Liebowitz on their work since taking over last year.\n\u201cI just needed a change,\u201d Davis said. \u201cReal estate is evolving. Either we\u2019re part of it, or we\u2019re not.\u201d\nNews of Davis\u2019 move comes roughly a month after his former partner, Black,\nexited Elliman\nwith 10 agents from their then-36-person team and returned to the Corcoran Group, where Black spent the first decade of his career.\nDavis and Black\u2019s combined teams, known as Noble Black &amp; Partners, placed fourth in\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nlatest rankings\nof the top resale agents and teams in New York City with $162 million in sales. The cohort also landed among the city\u2019s leading new development brokers, coming in at No. 13 with $92 million in sales.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known [Glenn] for years and have always admired his relentless work ethic, integrity, and ability to lead at scale,\u201d Serhant said in a statement.\nBefore joining forces with Black, Davis co-led another top team at Elliman with Justin Tuinstra, who went solo after the two ended their decade-long partnership. Davis said at the time that he and Tuinstra split months before he merged his then-10-person cohort with Black\u2019s team.\nDavis also previously worked on new developments with Elliman\u2019s leading team, the Eklund-Gomes Team.\n\u201cWe wish Glenn all the best in his new endeavor,\u201d a spokesperson for Elliman said in a statement.\nDavis is leaving Elliman on the heels of a number of high-profile departures, including the firm\u2019s\nlongtime advisor Neal Sroka\n, who left last month to focus full time on his consulting business after two decades with the brokerage. Another 20-year veteran, Kathy Murray, exited Elliman earlier this summer to join Corcoran.\nSerhant is in the midst of an expansion that began on the East Coast in April 2023 and has broadened to include\nadding an outpost\nin Arizona in March. The five-year-old firm now has 1,300 agents across 13 states, including its latest opening in Newport, Rhode Island earlier this month.\n",

        "content": "Georgina Chapman, founder of the fashion line Marchesa and ex-wife of disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein, has allegedly not been paying her bills.\nIn addition to a foreclosure filed on her West Village apartment, Chapman faces lawsuits over alleged nonpayment in her personal and professional life.\nChapman bought her home at\n99 Jane Street\nin an all-cash deal in 2009 for $1.7 million and later mortgaged the property with her brother and Marchesa CEO Edward Chapman in 2020. Upon satisfying that mortgage, she re-mortgaged the property in 2022, again with Edward, for $2.5 million.\nThe foreclosure complaint claims that Chapman, who was set to pay over $9,000 per month per the loan terms, defaulted in November 2024 and owes the original $2.5 million loan, interest and late fees.\nChapman, who announced her split with Weinstein in 2017 following sexual assault allegations made against the producer, finalized the divorce in 2021. The previous year, Weinstein had been convicted of third-degree rape and criminal sexual assault in the first degree and sentenced to 23 years in prison.\nThe condo board at 99 Jane Street sued Chapman earlier this year, alleging she had fallen behind on dues, which the foreclosure complaint claims are over $7,000.\n\nThat\u2019s a paltry sum compared to the over $1.4 million that\nGFP Real Estate\nclaims Marchesa owes for unpaid rent and utilities for its fourth-floor lease at 80 Eighth Avenue, according to a lawsuit filed in September. Marchesa also had occupied the 17th floor of the property but surrendered that space in September. GFP is seeking damages for late payments and to have Marchesa removed from the fourth floor.\nA merchant cash advance company also sued Marchesa, Georgina Chapman and Edward Chapman in July, alleging the pair instructed their bank to stop making payments after agreeing to pay $500,000 in receivables for an advance of $300,000.\nChapman rose to prominence when she co-founded Marchesa with Karen Craig in 2004. She married Weinstein in 2007 but distanced herself from him shortly after multiple reports detailed the producer\u2019s rampant criminal sexual activity. Craig left the company in 2019.\nWeinstein himself held a sizable real estate portfolio that he sold off following the rape accusations. That included a $25 million West Village townhouse he and Chapman once lived in together, a Hamptons home in Amagansett sold for $10 million in 2018 and a $16 million Westport, Connecticut,\nproperty\nsold for $16 million. Weinstein also owned an office condo on the third floor of 375 Greenwich Street, which\nsold\nin 2019 for more than $6 million.\nIn 2020, Chapman began dating actor Adrien Brody, who owns a historic castle in upstate New York and a home in the Hollywood Hills.\n",

        "content": "A pair of massive projects in Midtown Miami and Edgewater easily passed a city architectural aesthetics examination.\nOn Wednesday, the\nMiami Urban Development Review Board\napproved the master plan for Midtown Park, a planned $2 billion four-tower mixed-use complex at 3055 North Miami Avenue being built in phases, starting with a Prosper-branded condominium. The board also greenlit the design for a 47-story mixed-use high-rise with 499 apartments for a development site at 3350 Biscayne Boulevard that is currently for sale.\nMidtown Park\nThe board voted 3 to 0 in favor of Midtown Park\u2019s master plan with a few minor tweaks to the exterior of\nMidtown Park Residences by Prosper\n, the project\u2019s first planned building that will rise 28 stories with 288 units ranging from studios to three-bedroom condos. Midtown Park master developers Rosso Development, led by Carlos Rosso, and Midtown Development, led by Alex Vadia, are partnering with Santa Monica, California-based Prosper Hospitality, led by Brian De Lowe and Brad Korzen, on the Prosper-branded project.\nOverall, Midtown Park will have four condominiums, including another 28-story tower and two 17-story buildings. Designed by Coconut Grove-based Arquitectonica, the project will also feature 60,000 square feet of office space, more than 120,000 square feet of retail, two major public plazas, a network of pedestrian-oriented streetscapes and a racquet and padel club.\nMidtown Park is being developed on 5 acres in Midtown Miami that were previously slated for a Walmart store. That project did not move forward due to community opposition. In 2019, Walmart sold the property to Vadia\u2019s Midtown Development for\n$26.4 million\n.\n\n3350 Biscayne Boulevard\nA partnership between Amit Kort and Ofir Gabriel won the board\u2019s unanimous approval for a 47-story mixed-use building with 499 units on an 0.8-acre assemblage at 3350 Biscayne Boulevard and 234-264 Northeast 34th Street. The project also scored a 30 percent parking reduction.\nIn July, Kort and Gabriel relisted the site with a new asking price of\n$34 million\nafter it had been on the market for six months, Michael Hinton with Lee &amp; Associates, who is marketing the assemblage, previously told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe developers\u2019 Tulip Developments Group raised the price from\n$32 million\nbecause they scored administrative planning and zoning approval under Florida\u2019s Live Local Act, which allows developers to obtain higher density for mixed-use projects that set aside 40 percent of the units for households earning up to 120 percent the area median income (AMI). In Miami-Dade County, the AMI for a one-person household is $86,800.\nDesigned by Miami-based architect Kobi Karp, the project would also include 5,555 square feet of retail on the ground floor, 3,117 square feet of restaurant space on the 45th floor and 620 parking spaces with the 30 percent parking reduction.\nDevelopers typically have more success selling\nsites\nthat come with fully approved permitting plans.",

The asking price for the house, at 915 Franklin Avenue, is about $236 per square foot.\nAccardo, who rose from Al Capone\u2019s bodyguard to reputed boss of the outfit, bought the property with his wife, Clarice, in 1951 for a reported $125,000, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. The couple lived there until 1963, when they sold it for roughly $200,000 ($2.1 million adjusted for inflation) as Accardo moved into semi-retirement.\nThe listing, handled privately through\nCompass agent\nMaria Cullerton, describes the home as having the \u201cstately gravitas\u201d of a gubernatorial mansion.\nFeatures include a custom-tiled indoor pool, two-lane bowling alley, English pub, billiard room and rooftop garden. Mexican onyx is used throughout, even in the bathrooms, each with its own sitting area. A gatehouse sits on the 0.68-acre lot as well. The property carried a nearly $48,000 property tax bill in 2023.\n\nAccording to Elite Street, the mansion\u2019s current owners, Jose and Maria Jimenez \u2014 co-founders of the Carnicerias Jimenez grocery chain \u2014 bought the property in 2000 for $1.9 million and have made updates since. Cullerton told the outlet the mansion \u201cfeels like a museum,\u201d citing its craftsmanship and layers of 20th-century opulence.\nIf it trades anywhere near its $5 million ask, it would easily set a residential price record for\nRiver Forest\n. The suburb\u2019s priciest recent sale was a six-bedroom home that fetched\n$2.85 million in June\n. The next-highest active listing is a 5,600-square-foot home on Lathrop Avenue priced at $3.3 million.\nMob-era nostalgia drives intrigue in Chicago\u2019s near western suburbs.

        "content": "One of downtown Austin\u2019s last undeveloped full city blocks is in the hands of Hines.\nThe Houston-based developer signed a ground lease with the Texas General Land Office for the William P. Hobby Jr. State Office Building site, a three-building complex at 333 Guadalupe Street, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe GLO teased in July that it had inked a deal with a \u201cprominent developer\u201d but kept the name under wraps until now. Hines confirmed the partnership this week, while the state agency declined to provide further details on what\u2019s planned for the roughly 2-acre property, which holds a vacant 419,000-square-foot state office complex.\nThe project marks the end of a months-long selection process that drew bids from some of the state\u2019s biggest players, including Related Companies, Endeavor Real Estate Group, DHA Capital and Urbanspace, according to records obtained by the outlet. The\nGLO\nsaid its decision weighed developers\u2019 experience and financial strength, calling\nHines\na \u201cTexas business with a sterling reputation.\u201d\nWhile plans remain under wraps, the state has previously indicated it wants a mixed-use redevelopment incorporating residential and commercial components, with workforce housing among them.\nThe site could be redeveloped by right to a maximum of 1.9 million square feet, with no height maximum or parking requirements, according to a CBRE\nbrochure\n.\n\nThe sky is the limit, aside from financing and construction costs. Maxing out density-bonus zoning could yield an 18-story office building, a 20-story hotel with 600 keys and 650 resi units soaring 104 stories, plus retail and parking, the marketing materials suggested.\nThe site\u2019s location \u2014 next door to the newly opened 800,000-square-foot office tower\nThe Republic\n\u2014 makes it one of the most high-profile redevelopment opportunities in the Texas capital.\nThe Hobby Building, which has been deteriorating for years, was slated for demolition but is still standing. Once cleared, the block could anchor a wave of density on Austin\u2019s west side, where private projects have increasingly filled the skyline gaps once dominated by government properties.\nFor Hines, the deal extends its deepening Austin footprint. The firm is behind the\nT3 Eastside\nmass-timber office building and several master-planned communities in the metro. It also has plans for a 608,000-square-foot office project at\nThe Domain\n, after shelving a prior build-to-suit for\nIBM\n.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "East Hampton is\npreparing\nto go after illegal short-term rentals as local leaders warn that unchecked investor activity and online booking platforms are eating into the town\u2019s housing stock.\nTown officials said they plan to solicit proposals for software that can\ntrack and flag unregistered rentals\nlisted on platforms such as Airbnb, according to\nNewsday\n. Deputy Supervisor Cate Rogers told the board that only about half of the 1,874 listings found through analytics firm AirDNA are registered under East Hampton\u2019s rental registry law, which has been in place since 2015 and requires a $200 permit.\nRogers said the proliferation of homes purchased and flipped by out-of-town investors \u2014 many backed by specialized lenders and property managers \u2014 has distorted the local market.\n\u201cI do think we are looking at commercial investment in our residential districts by investors who only seek to make profit and are not looking at being part of this community at all,\u201d she said.\nThe town\u2019s rules already restrict short-term rentals to 14 days at a time, and no more than twice in a six-month period, but enforcement has proved cumbersome. The monitoring software could help pinpoint violators and track investor ownership, following the example of nearby Southold, which adopted the Rentalscape platform earlier this year.\n\nWhile Rogers floated several potential reforms \u2014 such as creating a dedicated section of the town code for short-term rentals, imposing a local tax, or raising registration fees \u2014 board members struck a cautious tone, warning that overregulation could harm the seasonal rental economy that underpins much of East Hampton\u2019s tourism sector.\nCouncilperson Ian Calder-Piedmonte said the board must \u201cmake sure that we don\u2019t become purely seasonal, and that we have a healthy, vibrant year-round community that we\u2019ve always had,\u201d emphasizing that the town\u2019s challenge is balancing visitor demand with year-round livability.\nOthers, like Councilperson David Lys, noted that many local families rely on rental income to make ends meet.\nEast Hampton\u2019s consideration mirrors a broader East End push to\nrein in short-term rentals\n. Southampton Village recently banned rentals under 14 days, while Riverhead requires a 30-day minimum.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A Miami design review board greenlit two Live Local Act projects in Wynwood Norte and Overtown with nearly 800 units, combined.\nABH Developer Group, led by Alexis Bogomolni, plans the Modis Architects-designed 36-story Wyn Park tower with 293 units and a rooftop restaurant at 3311 and 3327 Northwest Second Avenue, 169 Northwest 33rd Street and 182 Northwest 34th Street in Miami\u2019s Wynwood Norte neighborhood. In Overtown, an entity tied to Alan Omsky, co-founder of the KYU restaurant, plans a Kobi Karp-designed 55-story, 498-unit tower at 1210 Northwest Second Avenue and 211 and 223 Northwest 12th Street.\nThe developers designated 40 percent of apartments at their towers \u2013\u2013 or 117 units at Wyn Park and 200 units at the Overtown project \u2013\u2013 for households earning up to 120 percent of the area median income, consistent with the Live Local Act\u2019s requirement.\nThe Miami Urban Development Review Board approved\nthe projects\nat its meeting on Wednesday. Board members raved about Kobi Karp\u2019s design of the Overtown tower and approved it with a 3 to 0 vote. They were less thrilled about Modis\u2019 design of Wyn Park and approved it with a 2 to 1 vote. (The UDRB has 11 members, with three of them present for the vote on the projects.)\n\u201cI just can\u2019t get on board with it as a successful articulation. \u2026 The attempts on the fa\u00e7ade. The Lego-esque pieces,\u201d board member Dean Lewis said about Wyn Park. \u201cThe podium and the tower are trying to be related, but at the same time, I just don\u2019t see that fluidity in the dialogue. I see you knitting but I don\u2019t see you weaving.\u201d\nThe tower also lacks \u201csignage or stimulus\u201d to denote the rooftop restaurant, Lewis said.\n\u201cHow does this fit in Miami and the polycultural impact and the styles?\u201d he added.\nUDRB Chair Ligia Ines Labrada was more receptive to the design, saying the architect handled the ground-floor retail \u201csuccessfully.\u201d\n\u201cI really don\u2019t mind how you weaved the podium with the tower,\u201d she said, suggesting the architect can tweak the darker colors. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough project.\u201d\nLabrada and board member Manuel Gustavo Gallardo voted to approve the project with several conditions, including that the architect reconsider the rooftop design, extend the ground-floor canopy and revisit the massing, materials and colors on the fa\u00e7ade. Lewis voted against the project.\n\nThe board approved Omsky\u2019s project with much less discussion.\n\u201cI really do appreciate the project. And you get an economy of gesture without overly pushing,\u201d Lewis said.\nThe tower\u2019s podium will include permanent exterior murals of portraits of Overtown residents by artist Yana Volf.\n\u201cWe have an opportunity to bring the art of Overtown into Overtown,\u201d Karp said during the meeting, adding that the tower will be of condominium quality. \u201cSome people said to me, \u2018We would like to have a quality project in the community that is within the Live Local [Act].\u2019\u201d\nBoard members still imposed some conditions for its approval, including that the architect study the possibility of doing the murals as live art through a projection, add planters along the sidewalk and tweak the design to \u201ccelebrate\u201d the main entrance.\nThe UDRB\u2019s vote is merely a recommendation, and final say rests with the city\u2019s planning and zoning department officials.\nDevelopers have seized on the\nLive Local Act\nwith a flurry of project proposals. The state law, approved in 2023 and tweaked in the subsequent two years, allows developers to build larger projects as long as they include affordable and workforce apartments. The units have to remain income restricted for at least 30 years.\nIn Miami\u2019s Allapattah, Calta Group scored UDRB approval last month for its Live Local Act project, the 30-story, 499-unit\nAnatomia\nat 1415\u20131469 Northwest 13th Terrace. Midtown Capital plans a\n22-story, 348-unit\ntower at 7501 and 7553 Northeast Second Avenue in Miami\u2019s Little River.\nIn the biggest known South Florida Live Local Act project, Spanish developer Pablo Castro and Laura Tauber of Bay Harbor Islands-based real estate firm Taubco plan the\nThe HueHub\nwith 4,032 units in seven 35-story towers at 8395 Northwest 27th Avenue in Miami-Dade County\u2019s\nWest Little River neighborhood.\n",

The activist investor reportedly has built an active stake in Rexford, making it one of the top five investors.\nRexford only said \u201cyes have met with Elliott, and we have a constructive dialogue, as we encourage with all of our shareholders.\u201d When asked again, the company said it isn\u2019t in a position to comment on the nature of those discussions.\nNonetheless, Rexford executed 3.3 million square feet of new and renewed leases in the quarter, according to an earnings release.\n\nRexford offloaded three properties, two in Los Angeles County, for $53.6 million: one, at 8542 Slauson Avenue, cost $17.3 million, and another at 15715 Arrow Highway, cost $21.6 million. The latter property was supposed to be redeveloped but was instead sold to the in-place tenant.\nThe company has sold six properties so far this year for $187.6 million. It has another $160 million of dispositions under contract or accepted offer. But Rexford currently has no acquisitions, a shift from its\nbuying spree\nof a few years ago.\nRevenues increased to $253.2 million in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared to $241.8 million last year.\nIn Los Angeles County, where more than half of Rexford\u2019s holdings are \u2014 260 properties per its latest financial statement \u2014 the industrial vacancy rate is 5 percent. The vacancy rate for Rexford\u2019s holdings in the area is about 9 percent.\u00a0During its earnings call, the company mentioned an uncertain macroeconomic environment and the president\u2019s tariff policies as affecting tenant demand.\n",

The tough market conditions don\u2019t seem to be an obstacle for 93-year-old Bren, who famously restarted homebuilding in 2009 as developers were still picking up the pieces post-housing crash and has made a name as a pioneer in master-planned communities.\n\u201cFulfilling the vision of master planning has been a lifetime dedication and lifetime passion,\u201d Bren said in a statement to the Southern California News Group, which publishes the Orange County Register, Los Angeles Daily News and nine other newspapers in the region, and counts the Mercury News as a sister publication.\n\u201cI am hopeful the heritage of our stewardship will live on in many new ways,\u201d Bren said.\n\nPart of Irvine Company\u2019s efforts include converting offices, malls and industries sites into residential communities.\nIn Orange County, the firm has 1,481 apartments in the pipeline on two parcels near Irvine Spectrum shopping center previously set aside for offices. A 313-unit expansion of an existing complex next to Great Park is close to completion. Another 1,858 units are planned for a different Spectrum site previously slated for commercial use. An additional\n2,500 apartments are in the works near UC Irvine\n, and another 1,336 units will be built on land the company owns in Tustin. Plus, retail space at The Market Place shopping center in Irvine is being converted into 1,261 apartments, now pre-leasing. Further south in San Diego, 552 apartments are being proposed for an existing office campus near the University Town Center.\nOne person Bren won\u2019t be able to count on to continue his legacy is his own son, 33-year-old David Bren. Earlier this month, as scrutiny grew on the young son over an alleged real estate scam, a spokesperson for the elder Bren and Irvine Company shared a statement\ndistancing themselves from his son\n, saying they \u201cdo not have a personal or business relationship with this individual.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Most are in Lincoln Park or the North Shore, where buyers are moving decisively on standout inventory.\n\u201cThe good ones all go quickly, but the dogs linger,\u201d Ames told the outlet.\nThe ultrawealthy aren\u2019t swayed by mortgage rates or affordability concerns. Instead, they\u2019re motivated by scarcity \u2014 waiting patiently for an \u201cA-plus\u201d property to surface, then pouncing when it does.\n\nCompass agent Lisa Finks told the outlet that the rarity of exceptional homes has created \u201ca new category of urgency.\u201d Her Glencoe listing on Hogarth Lane, priced at just under $3.2 million, went under contract in three days. Some\nluxury buyers\n, she said, are purchasing homes months before they plan to move, leaving them empty until the timing suits \u2014 a flexibility most buyers can\u2019t afford.\nRecent examples abound: private equity executive Tom Soueles\u2019 $6.5 million mansion on\nBurling Street\nfound a buyer in seven days; Wilmette homes listed for $3.7 million and $5.3 million each went under contract in under a week; and a Deming Place rowhouse drew an offer in three days.\n@properties\nChristie\u2019s agent Alexa Hara said her clients offered 13 percent over ask \u2014 pushing a Winnetka listing above $3 million \u2014 to secure a renovated 1917 home facing the village green.\nSome contracts could still fall through, as with a $4.25 million listing on Magnolia Avenue that briefly went contingent before reentering the market.

        "content": "Karlin Real Estate chose\nDallas\u2019 most sought-after submarket\nfor its first North Texas multifamily acquisition.\nThe Los Angeles-based firm bought The Brady, at 2728 Cedar Springs Road in Uptown, according to a release. Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies provided the financing. The seller is Dallas-based JLB Residential, deed records show.\nTerms of the deal weren\u2019t released, but the property was valued at $128.4 million for tax purposes this year.\nThe Brady is an 18-story, 302-unit apartment building that was delivered in 2017. It\u2019s adjacent to Dallas\u2019 popular Katy Trail and features a seventh-floor pool. Karlin plans updates, the release said.\nThe property is situated at the epicenter of \u201c\nY\u2019all Street\n,\u201d which refers to Dallas\u2019 growing reputation as a financial hub rivaling Wall Street.\n\nThe area will soon be home to\nParkside Uptown\n, a 30-story tower from KDC and Pacific Elm for Bank of America\u2019s new office, and Hunt Realty\u2019s NorthEnd, an 11-acre, mixed-use project that will include a\ncampus for Goldman Sachs\n. Plus, the\nNew York Stock Exchange\nis setting up shop at Crow Holdings\u2019 Old Parkland, on the other side of Turtle Creek.\nSince 2020, Karlin has been focused on building its multifamily portfolio in Austin, acquiring more than 1,100 units in the last five years. The developer has mixed-use projects, like\nVerde Square\n.\nMultifamily operators\naround the state have been struggling after a historic glut of deliveries pushed rental rates and occupancy levels down.\nIn May, Dallas-Fort Worth reported a 1.5 percent decrease in rents over the last year, according to Yardi Matrix. The Metroplex\u2019s occupancy rate of 92.6 percent put it at third-lowest among the country\u2019s 30 largest cities.\nThe luxury set has been somewhat shielded from market challenges. The Brady\u2019s website advertises one-bedroom apartments starting at $2,720 per month. Two-bedroom apartments start at $4,360. The average rent in Dallas hovers around $1,400.\n",

How many licenses will be awarded? And whether, if any are held back, there will be another shot for casinos in Manhattan or otherwise to come into play.\u201d\n\u201cI think this is still a process that\u2019s playing out,\u201d he added.\nSL Green\u2019s proposal for a casino with Caesars Entertainment, Roc Nation and Live Nation was rejected in September. The decision prompted Holliday\nto lash out\nat the committee members, and he continued to criticize the process on the earnings call.\nOther Manhattan\nproposals\nby Silverstein Properties and Stefan Soloviev were also rejected.\n\nAfter that, favorites for the licenses appeared to be Resorts World NYC in Queens and Steve Cohen\u2019s bid next to Citi Field. But on Monday, MGM Resorts announced it was\ndropping what was considered a shoo-in bid\nfor a casino in Yonkers, possibly putting another license back into play.\nHolliday said that 1515 Broadway\u2019s biggest tenant, Paramount Global, is in a stronger financial position after it was purchased by Skydance Media in August for $8.4 billion, though it was unclear what the company\u2019s space needs would be.\nHe said one of the benefits of making the casino bid was that SL Green learned the building converts well to other uses, like entertainment or a hotel, and that the property has good financial flexibility with low debt.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good scenario for us to look at all options,\u201d he said.\nAcross its portfolio, SL Green reported office occupancy of 92.4 percent. Holliday said the company is on track to hit its goal of 93.2 percent by the end of the year.\n",

        "content": "Florida\u2019s Supreme Court denied Two Roads Development\u2019s request to hear the case involving a complex condo buyout in Miami\u2019s Edgewater, effectively ending Two Roads\u2019 legal avenues to challenge an earlier ruling.\nMiami and West Palm Beach-based Two Roads has long planned to develop an Edition Residences on the site of the former Biscayne 21 condo building at 2121 North Bayshore Drive in Miami.\nBut those plans were\nput on hold\nwhen a group of holdout condo owners sued the developer and the developer-controlled condo association in 2023. The suit was over the amendment of the condo declaration to lower the requirement for a condo termination to 80 percent of owners, from 100 percent. A condo termination is required to eventually redevelop the site.\nOn Tuesday, Florida\u2019s Supreme Court declined to weigh in on Two Roads\u2019 request, and denied the petition for review. The court wrote in a filing this week that it will not consider a motion for rehearing.\nTwo Roads, its attorney Jason Gonzalez and the holdout owners\u2019 attorney, Glen Waldman, did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Two Roads declined to comment.\nFlorida\u2019s Supreme Court was Two Roads\u2019 last hope regarding the allegation that the developer illegally amended Biscayne 21\u2019s condo declaration. Earlier this year, the Third District Court of Appeal\ndenied Two Roads\u2019 request\nfor a rehearing, siding with the holdout unit owners. The appeals court\u2019s opinion affirmed that the original condo declaration required unanimous consent for termination, invalidating the developer-controlled association\u2019s amendment.\nRobert Murphy, one of the holdout owners suing Two Roads, said he is \u201cgrateful to the Florida appellate courts for upholding our contractual rights.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m happy in the way a rape victim might feel happy when the jury comes back with a guilty verdict,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s ameasure of satisfaction that justice has been done, but you still live with the rape.\u201d\nThe outcome of the case could affect potential buyouts and terminations of condo associations with similar condo declarations, if the developer-controlled associations try to amend the condo termination threshold the same way.\n\n\u201cI have a little bit of a different take in that some people have commented that they think this will have a big chilling effect [on condo buyouts],\u201d said Miami-based Haber Law attorney David Podein, who is not involved in the case. \u201cI think many people have overstated what the third DCA ruled. I view this condo termination scenario as very specific.\u201d\nThe lawsuit, originally filed in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, will continue unless the developer settles with the remaining owners. It\u2019s unknown how Two Roads plans to move forward now.\n\u201cThe owners who have fought this, they may simply be seeking leverage,\u201d said Haber Law\u2019s Jonathan Goldstein, who is also not involved in the case. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of their incentives, to stick it out and stay and never sell, or to leverage more money.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also unclear how the developer will pay off the financing linked to the site. Two Roads has been on the hook for mounting interest, in the millions of dollars, on loans tied to the 2022 bulk purchase, filings show. Two Roads\u2019 TRD Biscayne financed the 2022 bulk purchase with a $45 million mezzanine loan from Lionheart Strategic Management LLC, the asset management affiliate of Fisher Brothers, and a $105 million senior mortgage from Bank OZK.\nThe timeline\nThree years ago, Two Roads\npaid about $150 million\nfor the majority of units at the bayfront condo building, which was constructed in 1964. Later that year, the developer\nlaunched sales\nof the first of three planned Edition towers, a 55-story, 185-unit tower, with unit prices starting at $1.7 million.\nHoldout owners Angelica Avila, Nicolas Bello, Maria Beatriz Gutierrez, Franah Vazir-Marino, Murphy, George Garcia, and two couples, Lazaro Fraga and Jacqueline S. Fraga, and Jeffrey Ulman and Shari Ulman, sued the following year.\nIn 2024, the Third DCA reversed a lower court decision that had denied the holdout owners a temporary injunction. The lower court had determined that amending the termination requirement did not \u201calter\u201d the voting rights of the unit owners. The Third DCA disagreed with this, and said that amending the vote threshold did alter the unit owners\u2019 voting rights.\nShortly after the Third DCA issued its opinion, the developer requested a rehearing. It took more than a year for the Third DCA to react and side with the holdouts.\n",

The seller was local firm Mardit Properties. The deal works out to $8.5 million per acre.\nSunnyvale city officials already\napproved plans for 242 residential units\nat the site, consisting of 162 apartments and 80 townhomes. The development application was filed by San Jose-based developer\nValley Oak Partners\n. The proposal also calls for a two-level parking garage and 2,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space.\nOrchard Supply Hardware closed all of its stores in 2018. Some of its sites were bought by retailer Outdoor Supply Hardware, while real estate developers bought other locations.\nEven Google owns one of the former locations, in downtown San Jose. That store was within the tech giant\u2019s\nproposed transit-oriented neighborhood development\n, which hasn\u2019t started construction though it\u2019s been in the works for years.\n\nMillrose Properties often provides homebuilders with a capital flow for efforts to build residential projects. New Home Company Northern California, for example, has an option to buy the property from Millrose, though the full terms of the option agreement have not been disclosed.\nThe construction and homebuilding markets are struggling nationwide this year amid high interest rates and tariff uncertainty.\nElsewhere in the Bay Area, Millrose Properties\nbought an 11-acre, three-building office campus at Bishop Ranch\nin San Ramon earlier this year from developer Sunset Development for $50 million.

        "content": "More\nbuilder\u2019s remedy projects in Beverly Hills\nare moving forward after additional approvals from the Beverly Hills Planning Commission.\nOn Tuesday, the city\u2019s Planning Commission gave the green light to two builder\u2019s remedy projects in the Los Angeles-area enclave, Urbanize Los Angeles\nreported\n.\nThe first development is a 12-story, approximately 124-foot-tall building at 346 North Maple Drive being pursued by a joint venture between\ndeveloper Leo Pustilnikov\nand Oak Investment Company, an affiliate of Beverly Hills-based Dromy International Investment Corporation. The plan is to replace an existing two-story, eight-unit residential building with a 65-unit residential tower containing studio, one- and two-bedroom units above a 15-car garage. The 346 Maple project will have to provide 13 units of low-income affordable housing in order to qualify for builder\u2019s remedy.\nBack in August, a Los Angeles County superior court judge ruled that Beverly Hills violated state housing law by trying to block Pustilnikov\u2019s proposal for a 19-story apartment building with a hotel and restaurant at\n125-129 South Linden Drive\n. Pustilnikov explained his thought process in challenging the city at\nThe Real Deal\u2019s Building Back L.A. roundtable\nevent in September.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Roosevelt approach: Speak softly and carry a big stick,\u201d he said, referring to former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt.. \u201cBeverly Hills is doing it to themselves. They had an opportunity to just have Linden, and they refused to cooperate and now they have 12 projects.\u201d\n\nNear the 346 North Maple site, DH 1821 Daly received approval for an 11-story development at 401 North Oakhurst Drive, which would rise approximately 131 feet, with 25 two-bedroom apartments, including five low-income units. The residences will be built above parking for 14 vehicles.\nBoth the Maple and Oakhurst developments are being designed by Ottinger Architects.\nThe latest approvals come a week after the Planning Commission took up three other builder\u2019s remedy applications at locations near the intersection of Beverly Drive and Olympic Boulevard. As with those applications, the City either couldn\u2019t make the findings required to deny the proposals for 346 Maple and 401 Oakhurst or is prohibited by state housing law from rejecting them.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The Pacific Palisades Bowl Mobile Home Estates community is still a mess nine months later, while the rest of the Palisades burn zone has been cleaned up.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency refused to include the 170-unit mobile home park in its debris-removal program, leaving residents with few options on how to proceed, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n. Los Angeles\u2019 Building and Safety Commission answered residents\u2019 call this week to declare the area a public nuisance. In doing so, the city can order the site to be cleaned up and bill the landowners.\nThe situation comes after the\nfastest wildfire debris removal effort\nin modern American history. FEMA\u2019s snub reportedly stemmed from the agency\u2019s mistrust of the owners of the rent-controlled community, as it didn\u2019t believe the owners would restore the property, on a bluff near the Pacific Coast HIghway, as affordable housing.\nMeanwhile, across a shared property line, the privately owned rent-controlled Tahitian Terrace mobile home park did qualify for FEMA aid after the agency determined its owners lacked the financial means to clean up asbestos-laced debris. FEMA made an exception in that case, saying the cleanup would help preserve a piece of affordable housing in the Pacific Palisades.\n\nThe Palisades Bowl\u2019s owners, heirs to late investor Edward Biggs, received $1.2 million in insurance funds and, according to FEMA, have the means to clear the property themselves.\nBiggs and his family previously squabbled with residents and the city in court over rent control and alleged neglect, and at one point floated plans for redevelopment into an \u201cupscale resort community.\u201d Residents won multimillion-dollar settlements, though doubts remained that the ownership intended to maintain affordability.\nStill, displaced residents wonder if the Palisades Bowl community will ever exist again.\n\u201cThey never do anything unless they are absolutely forced to,\u201d Jon Brown, a resident leading the rebuilding fight, told the outlet. \u201cIf we could go back, we\u2019d start again \u2014 with a vengeance.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "Horizon Realty Group cashed out quickly on a planned office-to-residential conversion in\nStreeterville\n, selling the century-old Pelouze Building in Streeterville to another local developer with a nearly identical plan.\nHorizon\nsold the seven-story loft building at 230 East Ohio Street last month for $9.75 million to affiliates of Wildwood Investments, according to property records and CoStar data. The sale price is well above the $5.6 million Horizon paid just a year earlier, underscoring the white-hot appetite for multifamily conversions in Chicago, CoStar\nreported\n.\nThe 1917 structure, designed by architect\nAlfred Alschuler\n, was once home to the Pelouze Scale &amp; Manufacturing Company and later hosted the office of\nLudwig Mies van der Rohe\n. It even had a brush with pop culture, serving as the exterior backdrop for the 1980s CBS sitcom Mary starring Mary Tyler Moore.\nHorizon\u2019s plan to convert the roughly 65,000-square-foot building into 72 apartments was already underway before the sale. The firm had completed interior demolition and relocated remaining office tenants, paving the way for a seamless handoff.\n\u201cWe finished the prep work,\u201d Horizon COO Jeff Michael told the outlet, declining to elaborate on the decision to sell what would have been the company\u2019s first office-to-resi project.\nWildwood, led by Matt Katsaros, confirmed it will proceed with the residential conversion but offered no further details.\n\nThe deal comes as Chicago\u2019s apartment market outperforms the rest of the country. CoStar data shows the region leading the nation in multifamily rent growth, buoyed by limited new supply as rising borrowing and construction costs slowed development. By contrast, rents in Sun Belt cities \u2014 after years of breakneck building \u2014 have begun to soften.\nWith construction increasingly difficult to finance, Chicago developers are turning to existing office stock to fill the gap.\nAdaptive reuse\nprojects are proliferating in the Loop, River North and Streeterville, where aging commercial buildings are being reimagined as housing to meet surging demand.\nThe Pelouze Building offers both history and opportunity for Wildwood \u2014 a character-rich asset in a neighborhood short on new apartments.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Four years ago, I\nhelped a friend in Austin\nlook for a place to buy in the Dallas metro area.\nDallas was cheaper than Austin, where he was renting an 800-square-foot apartment for $1,400 a month. The rise of remote work meant he was free to move anywhere.\nIt was an eye-opening experience for this lifelong New Yorker, because we have normalized the astronomical prices we pay for housing here.\nShopping in Dallas\nwas like going back in time.\nMaybe you\u2019re one of those people who reminisces about what homes in New York City cost 30 years ago, and wish you had bought more of them, or not sold what you had. \u201cIf only we had snapped up that fixer-upper that went for $600,000. It just sold for $6 million!\u201d my wife said once. (We couldn\u2019t afford it at the time anyway.)\nI recall house-hunting in 1993, when one-bedroom co-ops in Park Slope were as little as $75,000 and three-bedroom condos in landmarked brownstones went for $220,000. Everything is about eight times more expensive now.\nBut in Arlington, Texas, in late 2021, homes were trading for what they did in New York City in the early \u201990s. My friend was on a tight budget, had zero savings and owed thousands of dollars on his credit cards, so I tried to get him to buy a\n793-square-foot one-bedroom\n, newly remodeled with stainless steel appliances, for the preposterous price of $85,000.\nThe mortgage payment, insurance, property taxes and homeowners\u2019 association fees would have been $782 per month. The condo had a pool, too. It was so cheap, I thought about buying it myself.\nBut my friend had delusions of grandeur, which is how he had ended up in his sorry financial situation at the age of 56, despite being gainfully employed and having no family to support. He wanted someplace better, with more resale value, even though he expected to never sell.\nIn early 2022, he lost a bunch of bidding wars in the $130,000 to $150,000 range. Without my knowledge, he eventually bid $195,000 (which he couldn\u2019t afford) for a condo in North Dallas, a \u201cnicer\u201d (read: wealthier) neighborhood with \u201cbetter\u201d schools (even though he had no kids).\nFortunately, the deal fell through because the Biden administration\u2019s new rules for Fannie and Freddie required the condo to have more money in reserve than it did.\nI talked some sense into my friend, who then bought a similar unit in Arlington for $128,000. His mortgage, property taxes and insurance today are $793 a month. For the first time ever, he could save for retirement without repeatedly raiding his 401(k). He has since paid off his credit cards and put away $67,000.\nHe was able to achieve life-altering financial and housing stability because homes are so cheap in Arlington. Obviously, Texas is different from New York City in many ways, but it\u2019s noteworthy that Arlington achieved low-cost housing without rent regulation or subsidies. It simply let developers build basic, three-story complexes.\nThe state that most famously did the opposite, California, now has such high housing costs that many of its non-rich\nresidents are moving to Texas\n.\n\nBut there\u2019s a sad ending to this tale now developing: Texas localities are\nbanning apartment development\nby adopting some of the same restrictive rules that have made homes so costly in California (and New York, for that matter), as Jay Parsons\nrecently explained\n.\nHere\u2019s hoping state lawmakers manage to stop them before they learn California\u2019s lesson the hard way.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nMayoral front-runner Zohran Mamdani has said he was earning only $47,000 a year when he signed his first lease for his $2,300-a-month, rent-stabilized apartment in Queens. \u201cI was looking for an apartment that I could afford on my own,\u201d he\ntold\nthe New York Editorial Board. He omitted that landlords typically require tenants\u2019 annual income at lease-signing to be 40 times the rent, which would have been more than $90,000. How did he get the apartment? Send guesses to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Of the 191,000 apartments built over the past decade that received a city subsidy, only about 3 percent had three or more bedrooms, the New York Times\nreported\n.\nElsewhere\u2026\nGov. Kathy Hochul on Thursday signed legislation that, in her words, \u201cbans collusion using algorithm-enabled rent price fixing.\u201d The Real Estate Board of New York had asked Hochul to make some chapter amendments to the bill, S7882/A1417-B, but she didn\u2019t.\nThe measure didn\u2019t seem like a high priority for REBNY, though, because it doesn\u2019t outright ban software programs that help landlords price their rentals. Assembly sponsor Linda Rosenthal had\nalready amended the bill\n.\nThe bill summary says the legislation \u201cprohibits a person or entity from knowingly or with reckless disregard facilitating an agreement between two or more residential rental property owners or managers to not compete with respect to residential rental dwelling units, including by operating or licensing a software, data analytics service, or algorithmic device that performs a coordinating function \u2026 among such residential rental property owners or managers.\u201d\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$4.75 million\nfor a 3,443-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at 323 Bergen Street in Boerum Hill.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$20 million\nfor a 27,020-square-foot auto body repair facility at 127-48 Northern Boulevard in Corona.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$29.5 million\nfor a 12,250-square-foot townhouse at 11 Gramercy Park South.

        "content": "The City of Beverly Hills is preparing for a showdown with\nMax Netty\n\u2019s\nSoundview Investment\nover a proposed builder\u2019s remedy development on Rodeo Drive.\nThe city has received \u201ca written threat of litigation\u201d over a proposed development project at 145 South Rodeo Drive, according to an\nagenda\nfor the City Council\u2019s closed session conference with legal counsel Friday afternoon.\nThe site is just south of Wilshire Boulevard, about a quarter-mile away from Rodeo Drive and the Beverly Wilshire Hotel.\nThe saber rattling on the proposed development, which would replace a two-story office building, came in an email from Netty\u2019s lawyer in May, shared with\nThe Real Deal\n. The looming showdown comes as Beverly Hills has\nbegun signing off\non some other projects in the tony enclave.\n\u201cThe attached letter is a denial of the project because it takes away the ability to proceed under builder\u2019s remedy,\u201d Ryan Leaderman of Holland and Knight wrote in the email to the city. \u201cWithout a modification to the City\u2019s position on this issue, litigation is highly likely given the denial of the project as proposed.\u201d\nBuilder\u2019s remedy allows housing developers to skirt local zoning\nin cities such as Beverly Hills\nthat have failed to certify their state-mandated housing plans. Beverly Hills was subject to builder\u2019s remedy for several months but is now in compliance with the state\u2019s requirements, known as the \u201chousing element\u201d on plans for housing development.\n\u201cPlease let me know if there is going to be a change in the City\u2019s position,\u201d Leaderman wrote. \u201cI assume that you might need to go to City Council for a closed session discussion.\u201d\nThe proposed development on Rodeo Drive would replace a two-story office building. Soundview wants to construct a new mixed-use development, per a May 1 email the city sent Leaderman. City officials said the latest application differs significantly from a previously approved plan, and has been deemed ineligible for processing as a \u201cbuilder\u2019s remedy project.\u201d\nThe city claims the preliminary application was submitted in February 2024 as all rental units.\nThe more recent plans include a subdivision that now includes condominiums as well as rentals.\n\n\u201cCity staff has determined in good faith that the 145 South Rodeo Drive project is a different project than the [preliminary application] project because of the omission of subdivision information,\u201d the city wrote.\nIn addition, the letter says the 180-day deadline to resubmit an application expired on Aug. 24, 2024.\nThe latest proposal does not comply with the city\u2019s zoning ordinances in its height and density, and therefore needs builder\u2019s remedy to override city rules.\n\u201cIt is not a valid builder\u2019s remedy project, and thus can no longer rely on the builder\u2019s remedy provisions of Government Code Section 65589.5 to insulate the Development Application Project from the general plan and zoning consistency requirements,\u201d the letter says.\nTo proceed with the development application project, the developer would have to seek general plan and zoning amendments for non-builder\u2019s remedy projects.\nLeaderman was \u201cout sick\u201d per an email, and a city attorney didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nThe cases could be impacted by Leo Pustilnikov\u2019s\nvictory in superior court\nin August. A judge ruled that Beverly Hills violated state housing law in its attempt to block his proposal for a 19-story apartment building with a hotel and restaurant at 125-129 South Linden Drive. Pustilnikov\u2019s projects got a greenlight from the Beverly Hills Planning Commission.\nNetty\u2019s Soundview, meanwhile, also has proposed a\n27-unit condominium development\nat 140 South Camden Drive, a block south of Wilshire Boulevard, which appears bound for a showdown with city officials, too.\n\u201cPlease also be aware that we are preparing to litigate for the 140 S. Camden project as well,\u201d Leaderman wrote.\n",

        "content": "Prolific Chicago investor Stuart Handler recently sold a three-property multifamily portfolio in\nHyde Park\nfor $23.5 million.\nThe transaction came out to roughly $113,000 per unit. Records of the sale have not been made public yet, and Kiser Group brokers Aaron Sklar and Noah Birk, who represented Handler, declined to identify the buyer.\nThe sale is welcome news for the South Side, where a recent\nfederal raid drew nationwide controversy\n. Amid an immigration enforcement\ncrackdown\nin Chicago, federal agents arrested 37 people for a variety of charges at a South Shore apartment building on Sept. 30, leaving residents shaken and local officials questioning the federal government\u2019s tactics.\n\u201cThat obviously isn\u2019t a great look on the South Side, but there\u2019s a million other buildings where things are going great and the neighborhoods are feeling vibrant,\u201d Birk said.\nHandler, who is the namesake behind the University of Illinois Chicago\u2019s Handler Department of Real Estate, was a longtime owner of the portfolio and has been actively\nbuying\nand\nselling\nChicago multifamily properties throughout the past year.\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably one of the most-respected operators without a doubt in Chicago, but probably nationally as well,\u201d Sklar said.\nLast spring, Handler\u2019s firm TLC Management sold a 136-unit apartment building on the South Side, at 4817 South Drexel Boulevard. Jeremy Bronfman\u2019s Lincoln Avenue Communities snagged the property for $31 million or about $227,000 per unit.\n\nAround the same time, Handler bought a 192-unit property in the northwest suburb of Mount Prospect for $60 million or about $312,000 per unit. Local developer Wingspan Development Group was the seller.\nThe Hyde Park properties, near the University of Chicago, have 207 studio and one bedroom units and 127,000 square feet. Rents range from about $1,100 to $1,200 for the studios and about $1,400 for the one-bedroom units. The three buildings bring in about $1.7 million in net operating income, according to the listing.\nThe studio and one-bedroom properties are located at 5326 South Cornell Avenue, 5417-25 South Harper Avenue, 5210-14 South Woodlawn Avenue in Hyde Park and 661 West Sheridan Road and 434 West Wellington Avenue in Lakeview.\nWhen Handler listed the Hyde Park portfolio,\nhe also listed a pair of North Side multifamily buildings\nat 661 West Sheridan Road and 434 West Wellington Avenue.\nChicago-based J&amp;J Equities bought The West Wellington Avenue building in Lakeview for $10.8 million this August. J&amp;J Equities made the purchase, which came out to about $150,000 per unit, as a part of a 1031 exchange.\nThe other Lakeview property is under contract, Birk and Sklar said.\nHandler\u2019s transactions are part of a busy streak of\nmultifamily\nsales in Chicago as the market continues to outperform the Sun Belt amid historically low new supply coming online.",

The chamber is working to help Vanderbilt get settled, said Rodney Fong, CEO and president of the chamber.\nThe study considered other locations downtown, including\nSalesforce Tower\n, the Embarcadero and Jackson Square, but \u201cit really sort of arrived at the Fifth and Mission corridor for the core reasons of transportation,\u201d Fong said.\nOther opportunities in the area include the Old Mint building, the\nbeleaguered San Francisco Centre mall\nand the Fifth and Mission Garage.\n\nThe 5M Project\u2019s un-redeveloped properties include Hearst\u2019s 110 Fifth Street, which has been\napproved for a 400-unit condo tower\n, as well as the San Francisco Chronicle building at 901 Mission Street. Other buildings include a 302-unit apartment tower at 434 Minna Street and a 640,000-square-foot office tower at 415 Natoma Street that has high vacancy.\nThe university reportedly hasn\u2019t made a deal yet.\nVanderbilt has about 13,000 students and is trending toward coastal expansion, with hubs in the works in New York City and South Florida. Its planned $520 million campus in West Palm Beach received a\n$50 million donation\nfrom power player Stephen Ross of the Related Companies this year.\nAnd in New York, it received approval last month for a\n99-year groundlease\nwith the General Theological Seminary in Chelsea.\nMeanwhile, Vanderbilt is expanding in its hometown as well. It\u2019s seeking developers for 40 acres it owns in Midtown Nashville for an\ninnovation district\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Central Texas sellers are coming to terms with\nbuyer leverage\n.\nAs fall began, sellers in the\nAustin-Round Rock-San Marcos area\nentered the market more cautiously and accepted deeper price cuts, according to Unlock MLS.\nSeptember brought the lowest close-to-list price ratio this year at 91.6 percent, along with the narrowest year-over-year increase in active listings.\nThere were 10 percent more homes for sale last month than in September 2024, compared to a 13 percent year-over-year increase in August and a peak increase this year of 19.7 percent in April.\nDespite the deceleration, fall has its music, too, as the poem goes. Closings increased 6.7 last month compared to a year ago, the broadest jump so far this year. That metric lagged behind 2024 for most of the year; before September, only January and June had year-over-year increases.\nConcurrently, sales volume increased 5.6 percent year over year to $1.3 billion, making September the only month besides June to exceed the previous year\u2019s volume.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the strongest sales growth we\u2019ve seen in 2025,\u201d said Brandy Wuensch, CEO of Unlock MLS and the Austin Board of Realtors.\n\nInventory growth is slowing, and parties are negotiating lower deals.\n\u201cBuyers are returning to the market, they\u2019re gaining confidence, knowing that they have more negotiating power. And sellers are also understanding that, if they want to move, they need to be flexible in negotiating in these terms,\u201d Wuensch said.\nWhile some agents say the\nAustin\narea has become a\nbuyer\u2019s market\n, Wuensch considers it a balanced market.\n\u201cWhen we see our inventory go over six months, that\u2019s where you\u2019re in a true buyer\u2019s market,\u201d Wuensch said.\nThe Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos area has exceeded six months of inventory just once this year, reaching 6.1 in July. September had 5.7 months of inventory, a year-over-year increase of 0.6 and a month-over-month decline of 0.2.\nSellers weren\u2019t eager to enter the market. New listings in September trailed last year for the second month in a row, decreasing year over year by 5.7 percent. That\u2019s the widest negative margin all year, and a thorough correction from July, when new listings increased by 13.4 percent year over year.\n",

When asked about the overall project, 45 percent of respondents supported it, while 40 percent were opposed.\nIn August, Bexar County Commissioners voted to send the ballot items to voters in a proposal that could provide $500 million in visitor tax revenue for a new Spurs arena and renovations to the Frost Bank Center, the current home of the Spurs, should voters approve the measure.\nVoter-approved funds could also go to work on redeveloping the grounds of the Freeman Coliseum, a concert venue and home of the stock show and rodeo. Bexar County would contribute 25 percent of the cost and no more than $311 million to the project.\nSpurs Sports and Entertainment Chairman and Managing Partner Peter J. Holt has pledged $1 billion toward the projects: at least $500 million for the new arena, $500 million for adjacent development and $60 million for community incentives.\nThe Spurs also pledged to cover cost overruns. In late August the San Antonio City Council approved the continuation of\nCity Manager Erik Walsh\u2019s negotiations\nwith Spurs Sports on a term sheet.\n\nOpposition in the polling was stronger for the NBA team\u2019s proposed arena, with 46 percent of respondents saying they would vote against it and 15 percent undecided. About 41 percent opposed funding the rodeo expansion, which includes redeveloping the Frost Bank Center, the team\u2019s current home.\n\u201cSupport for ballot propositions is always very fluid,\u201d in a news release outlining the findings of the poll. \u201cThat said,\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that the effort to secure venue tax funding for a new Spurs arena faces an uphill battle,\u201d said Bryan Gervais, UTSA political science professor and director of the\nresearch center\n.\nThe poll surveyed 660 likely Bexar County voters between Oct. 1 and Oct. 3 using computer-assisted, self-interviewing software in English and Spanish. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percent.\nThe findings come as city leaders and Spurs ownership make their case for the new arena, arguing it would anchor a revitalized downtown district and attract more events year-round. The prospect of the project getting off the ground also renewed interest in downtown San Antonio\u2019s office market despite high vacancy rates near\n27 percent\n.\nCritics\n, meanwhile, question using public venue tax revenue for a facility that could primarily benefit the team.\nGervais said campaigns on both sides \u201chave plenty of room to move the needle.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Housing earned a brief mention during the first general election mayoral debate on Thursday, largely focused on Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani\u2019s plan to freeze rents for stabilized tenants.\nDebate moderators pushed Mamdani on how he could promise to freeze the rent for four years without seeing the annual analysis produced by the\ncity\u2019s Rent Guidelines Board\n. Mamdani pointed to data released in previous years that showed landlord profits on the rise.\nThe\nauthority\nto set annual rent increases for stabilized rents lies with the nine-member board, though mayors have\ninfluenced\nits decisions.\nThe board releases a report every year that suggests different potential rent increase ranges, based on different financial considerations. The final rent increases do not have to, and often do not, abide by those ranges. Landlord groups have long\ncriticized\nthe board\u2019s reports detailing rises in buildings\u2019 net operating income because those calculations include market-rate units.\nOne of the moderators, Politico New York\u2019s Sally Goldenberg, twice asked Mamdani if he was making a determination based on data he has not yet seen. Both times, he pointed to previous data.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the data year after year, of the fact that salaries are stagnating, costs are up, New Yorkers can\u2019t actually afford their apartments,\u201d he said.\nHe added that he would take action to help landlords with insurance, property taxes and water bills.\nFormer Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent, repeatedly noted that Mamdani lives in a stabilized apartment and criticized the rent freeze proposals.\n\u201cFreeze the rent only postpones the rent because then you have to have an increase to cover the costs,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, the building is going to go bankrupt.\u201d\nWhen asked what he would do for renters who do not live in stabilized housing, Mamdani pointed to plans to build 200,000 units of \u201ctruly affordable homes.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make it easier for the private sector to build housing in this city, because what we see today is, it\u2019s not labor, it\u2019s not materials, it\u2019s the wait that is often costing so many, so much to actually build the housing we need in this city,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite this promise to build more housing, Mamdani has not taken a position on three controversial\nballot questions\naimed at speeding up approval of affordable housing. Though moderators didn\u2019t ask about the measures, Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa noted his opposition to and pointed out that Democratic leaders of the City Council also oppose the measures. He also said he is the only candidate who opposes zoning changes approved as part of the\nCity of Yes for Housing Opportunity\n.\nWhen asked how he hopes to bring down costs in the city if he doesn\u2019t support the construction of new housing, Sliwa said office buildings in Manhattan should be converted for residential use.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to go into the outerboroughs, you don\u2019t need to use wetlands or parklands,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you build a new building, it takes five years. If you convert an existing building, it can be done in a year.\u201d\nCuomo was asked about his proposal, dubbed \u201cZohran\u2019s Law,\u201d and\ncriticism\nthat it would require tenants to pay too much of their income toward rent. Under the proposed law, when a regulated apartment becomes vacant, a landlord could only rent to someone who would spend at least 30 percent of their income on rent. Both tenant and landlord groups have criticized the proposal.\nCuomo, who repeatedly referenced that he served as secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, said the proposal is meant to ensure the units are reserved for the city\u2019s most rent-burdened.\nLater in the debate, the moderators asked the candidates how they would enforce the city\u2019s emissions law, Local Law 97.\nCuomo and Mamdani agreed that some owners will opt to pay the fine for non-compliance rather than invest in the building upgrades required to meet the law\u2019s requirements.\n\u201cYes, I support the law, yes, we have to implement it, but we have to implement it in a way that is feasible,\u201d Cuomo said. He has\nreportedly\ntold a coalition of co-op boards that he is open to modifying the law to make compliance easier.\nMamdani said the city could help condo and co-op owners by buying green building technology in bulk. Sliwa indicated that he would slow the law\u2019s implementation.\n",

        "content": "Developer Michael Shvo is no longer involved in the Raleigh Miami Beach, the trophy asset he planned to redevelop into a luxury condo and hotel project.\nNew York-based Nahla Capital paid about $270 million for the three-acre property at 1775, 1757 and 1751 Collins Avenue, sources confirmed to The Real Deal.\nBloomberg\nfirst reported the sale. Nahla, a private equity firm with $2 billion in assets under management,\nwon a bid\nto purchase the project this summer, though Shvo had a right of first refusal and was reportedly working on raising new funds to pay off his partners and the debt backing the property.\nThe sale largely marks Shvo\u2019s exit from the Miami Beach market, where he made a splash when he and his partners, Deutsche Finance America and a consortium of German pension funds,\npaid $243 million\nfor the Raleigh assemblage in 2019, which includes the Richmond and South Seas hotels.\nShvo hired Peter Marino and Kobi Karp Architecture &amp; Interior Design to design the Raleigh.\u00a0 The developer gutted the original buildings and secured approval for a 17-story luxury condo tower on the beachfront site. The project includes 44 luxury condos, a private members\u2019 club and a hotel component. The Raleigh, an iconic Art Deco hotel known for its pool, was designed by L. Murray Dixon.\nMost presales were in the $5,000-plus per square foot range, though the Wall Street Journal reported that a unit was under contract for nearly $8,500 per square foot. The Raleigh struggled to compete with Witkoff and Monroe Capital\u2019s nearby Auberge-branded condo and hotel redevelopment of the Shore Club.\nLast summer, Shvo\ncut ties with\nOfficial, the former Side-backed firm co-founded by Oren and Tal Alexander, after the Alexander brothers faced allegations of rape and sexual assault. Official was previously handling sales of the Raleigh. One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Anna Sherrill took over sales.\n\nIn 2023, the partners secured\na $190 million refinancing\noriginated by BH3 Management, and the firm had repeatedly extended the maturity date for the loan. A spokesperson for BH3 said that the loan was paid off in connection with this sale.\nA spokesperson for the Raleigh said that the partnership \u201chas chosen to sell the property to Nahla\u201d following its repositioning of the project.\nNewmark\u2019s Adam Spies and Marcella Fasulo arranged the sale.\nIn September, Shvo\nsold his Alton Road assemblage\n, where he planned a luxury office and apartment project, to Infinity Collective via a deed-in-lieu-of-foreclosure.\nShvo still owns a portion of the development for his One Soundscape Park office project at 1665 and 1667 Washington Avenue in Miami Beach.\n",

The property is at 9703 Collins Avenue in\nBal Harbour\n.\nThe lender, San Francisco-based Column, is reviewing a request by Al Rayyan, led by CEO Tarek El Sayed, for an extension, Morningstar states.\nThough Al Rayyan maintained an above breakeven debt service coverage ratio, its 2024 net cash flow reportedly fell to about half of 2021 levels, potentially triggering tighter scrutiny from bondholders, the report shows.\n\nAl Rayyan\n, whose chairman Sheikh Faisal Bin Qassim Al Thani is a member of Qatar\u2019s ruling Al Thani family, obtained the loan in 2021, records show. The firm used the loan proceeds to pull out $44.5 million in equity and pay off a previous\n$132 million\nmortgage that had been acquired by London-based Reuben Brothers, led by billionaire siblings David and Simon Reuben.\nSt. Regis Bal Harbour is a condo-hotel completed in 2011 consisting of three 27-story towers with 192 hotel rooms and 205 condos. Al Rayyan acquired the hotel portion, which is housed in the complex\u2019s center tower, for $213 million in 2014 from billionaire Barry Sternlicht\u2019s Miami Beach-based Starwood Capital Group.\nAl Rayyan also invested $40 million in renovations, loan filings show. Last year, the\nSt. Regis Bal Harbour Residences condo association\nsued Al Rayyan, alleging building defects, health and safety issues and financial mismanagement. The association is seeking a comprehensive assessment of the building and remediation for a laundry list of alleged issues in the complex, the pending complaint in Miami-Dade Circuit Court states.\nAlso in 2024, Al Rayan sold the ownership entity for the\nW Miami\n, a 50-story, 148-key hotel in Miami\u2019s Brickell neighborhood, to a joint venture between Aventura-based BH Group and S\u00fczer Group. The price was not disclosed.",

        "content": "After years of work, a West Village megamansion is finally making its public debut with an asking price that could upend local records.\nThe 13,000-square-foot townhouse at\n105-107 Bank Street\nwas listed for $75 million, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. That works out to $5,769 per square foot for the Robert A.M. Stern Architects design.\nThe home features six bedrooms. The primary suite includes dual bathrooms, dressing rooms, a sitting room and private terrace. There\u2019s also a six-story floating staircase and a roof skylight.\nRoundSquare Builders acquired the separate walkups in 2021 and 2022 for a combined $18 million, though the firm didn\u2019t disclose how much construction cost over the succeeding years.. The company needed approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission before gutting the century-old properties.\nThe townhouse is revamped, but its history remains present: John Lennon and Yoko Ono lived at 105 Bank, while composer John Cage lived at 107 Bank. The rear of the house includes a spiral staircase refurbished and lifted from Lennon\u2019s apartment.\n\nThe downtown townhouse record fell only last year, when Slack co-founder Stewart Butterfield and Away co-founder Jen Rubio bought a double-wide townhome\nfor $72.5 million\n.\nLeslie Garfield\u2019s Matthew Lesser has the listing. He refused showings and visits to the 40-foot-wide property until it was complete, reluctant to display anything less than a finished product.\nThe process of combining properties into a megamansion is controversial and can draw local opposition. Buildings that once housed multiple families become singular residences for a select few, seemingly in contrast to the housing shortage the city faces.\nCombining apartments or replacing small-unit multifamily buildings with oversized townhouses or large duplexes has cost the city\nmore than 100,000 homes\nover the decades. At one time, it was far more common for developers to convert single-family row houses into co-ops or multifamily rentals.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The rezoning still requires first and second reading approvals from the city commission at later, unspecified dates.\nDespite unanimous approval, board members raised concerns about parking, traffic and green space. The approval includes a condition that a parking study be completed.\nLast November, 62 percent of\nvoters approved\na charter amendment to redevelop Jungle Island. The joint venture between\nDavid Martin\n\u2019s\nTerra\nand ESJ will acquire the 5.4 acres that are currently part of the 13.3-acre Jungle Island property at 1111 Parrot Jungle Trail in Miami. The developers plan to build two up to 48-story luxury condo towers on the land they\u2019re buying from the city. Much of the existing waterfront Jungle Island theme park will become the $37 million public park paid for by the developers.\nThe assessed purchase price for the land that the developers are purchasing is $160 million, but the developers will provide much of that\nvia public benefits\n. At closing, Terra and ESJ will pay $10 million. They will also make annual payments to the city for 99 years, provide $20 million in public benefits, and $22 million to pay off a HUD loan to the Jungle Island property, according to a previous city meeting.\nAt Wednesday\u2019s meeting, board member Arthur Porosoff, a broker and developer, called the proposed 50 parking spaces \u201cfrustrating,\u201d and the larger discussion around parking a waste of time. He also said the planned public park was really a park for the 800 residents of the planned condominium component. He said the developers are \u201ctaking advantage of the people.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s be real,\u201d Porosoff said. \u201cThe reality is that it\u2019s a joke\u2026.This is an amenity for the building. I understand everybody gets paid a lot of dollars. I get paid big dollars. I\u2019m a developer. I like the story. I would hire you to tell the story, and I would hire you to convince them to agree with the story, but the fact of the matter is that this is not for the public. Am I going to vote for it? Yeah, I\u2019m a real estate guy. But the fact of the matter here is that this is a joke, and everybody knows it.\u201d\nPorosoff sought to extract more parking from the developer, but realized that the city no longer had leverage to do so.\n\u201cNow that I think about it, that\u2019s a moot point. You can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThe deal was already struck, and it\u2019s a bad deal that we did, in my mind.\u201d\n\nThe developers\u2019 attorney, Iris Escarra, said the city\u2019s parks department will dictate the design used to build the park, as well as how much parking to include. But the parking will cut into the 13-plus acres of park space.\nBoard member Joseph Corral also pressed the developers\u2019 team on parking, as well as how people will access the park.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to be skeptical,\u201d Corral said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard, because if you would have told the people they were voting for a referendum to build [up to 48]-story towers, it would have never passed. But the park is really all we saw. We all saw the beautiful renderings.\u201d\nThe park\u2019s designer, Daniel Vasini of West Eight, called the park a \u201cgame-changer.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a great bicycle lane so you can come here by bike,\u201d Vasini said.\nCorral interrupted him: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.

At stake is $185 million in funding, which would make up about 13 percent of the agency\u2019s 2025-26 budget.\n\n\u201cThe HUD certifications cite several recent Executive Orders but provide no additional information or clarification on these requirements beyond the language in the application,\u201d according to the press release.\nThe CHA is also anticipating similar restrictions to future HUD allocations which could affect up to $1 billion in funding for the agency, which serves 135,000 Chicago residents. Local housing authorities typically get the majority of their funding from HUD.\nThe agency is seeking a temporary restraining order.\n\u201cWe are asking the court to step in and provide guidance on the lawfulness of the conditions HUD is seeking to impose,\u201d said CHA Operating Chairman Matthew Brewer in the news release. \u201cThis intervention is a necessary last resort since our discussions with HUD have been limited due to the government shutdown.\u201d\nThe press release also noted that a similar case is ongoing in Rhode Island and requests that a judge consider the outcome of that lawsuit as well.\nThis is a developing story, check back for updates.",

        "content": "Less than a year after securing a trio of high-end tenants for a Gold Coast retail space, Fred Latsko is putting the property on the market.\nThe Chicago developer tapped Newmark brokers to sell the 4,200-square-foot building at 900 North Rush Street, which sits at the base of a 17-story condo tower at 40 East Delaware Place, CoStar\nreported\n.\nThe space is fully leased to international\nfashion brands\n: California-based Rails, Danish label Ganni and Toronto jeweler Mejuri. The leases, announced late last year, marked a notable reactivation of a former Intermix boutique in one of Chicago\u2019s priciest retail corridors.\nLatsko declined to disclose an asking price, but a Newmark marketing brochure shows the tenants have a weighted average lease term of nearly 10 years and collectively generate more than $1.5 million in annual net operating income, the outlet reported. The offering is being marketed by brokers\nKeely Polczynski\n, Conor Lalor, Kyle Minter, Brian Schneiderman, Eric Williams and Mat Adler.\nPersistently high borrowing costs have kept many investors sidelined. But the property\u2019s timing could benefit from renewed leasing momentum across Rush, Oak and Walton streets, where brands including Kith, Skims, Cartier and Brandy Melville have recently taken space.\n\nGanni\u2019s deal at 900 North Rush marked the brand\u2019s first Midwest location, while Latsko has also drawn Bottega Veneta to his nearby property at 41 East Oak Street. He refinanced that building, along with 900 North Rush and two others nearby, with a $34 million loan from JDI Realty in 2023 \u2014 less than a previous\n$43.6 million Loancore loan\n.\nLatsko\u2019s latest listing adds to a small but active pool of\nGold Coast\nretail trades, where strong tenant rosters have helped sellers push through interest-rate headwinds.\nInstitutional capital has largely retreated from the market, but long-term investors seeking trophy retail exposure continue to hunt in Chicago\u2019s luxury shopping areas.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The lenders will also provide an $89.4 million mezzanine loan, per the report, which appraises the 1.3 million-square-foot, 39-story trophy tower at nearly $2 billion.\nThe interest-only CMBS loan has a two-year term with three one-year extension options. Proceeds will go toward repaying\nprevious debt\n, including a $750 million loan from ING Group and a $300 million mezzanine loan from Apollo Global Management.\nThe blockbuster refi comes after Brookfield spent $400 million rededeveloping and modernizing the 1950s building, formerly known as\n666 Fifth Avenue\n, putting on a new facade clad with glass panels, along with an upgraded lobby, amenity space, elevators and improved infrastructure to significantly reduce the carbon footprint.\nThe building, two blocks north of Rockefeller Center, hit\nfull occupancy\nin September, when Scotiabank inked a 205,000-square-foot lease, a major milestone for a property mired in controversy less than a decade ago.\n\nBrookfield purchased the 99-year ground lease from Kushner Companies\nin a $1.3 billion deal\n, raising questions about whether\nJared Kushner leveraged foreign policy connections\nto secure a bailout of the property (the Qatari government holds investments with Brookfield).\nIn May 2022, Australian financial services company Macquarie Group became the first tenant to sign on at the revamped property,\ntaking 250,000 square feet\n. Other tenants jumped on board soon after, including 400 Capital, Stephens and Viking.\nLate last year, Citadel agreed to\ntake 504,000 square feet\nat 660 Fifth, the second-largest lease of the second quarter in Manhattan.

        "content": "A unit in a church-to-condo conversion dubbed The Abbey has blessed Fort Greene with a new price record.\nOriginally asking $3.85 million off-market, a bidding war pushed the purchase price of unit 9 to $4.07 million, with the buyer agreeing to cover $83,000 in transfer taxes, according to Douglas Elliman\u2019s Jessica Peters, who is leading sales at the building with Daniel Fried. The purchase price includes a $20,000 storage unit.\nThe final price, including concessions for the 2,023-square-foot home, puts the deal at $2,052 per square foot, a new per-foot record in the neighborhood.\nThe three-bedroom home retained several original Gothic revival-style arched windows in the living room and bedrooms, with the bedrooms featuring circular stained glass above lancet arches.\nThe open-concept great room features a 20-foot vaulted ceiling that looks up to a hexagonal dome overhead. The side-by-side 36-inch Sub-Zero fridge and freezer are paneled into the wall, and the home comes with a library ladder to reach upper-level cabinetry.\nCompleted in 1888, the church was converted into rentals in 2016 before KSR Development scooped up the property for over $12 million in 2024 to turn it into luxury condos. Peters and Fried have sold eight of the 12 condos, including unit 10, which sits in the church\u2019s original bell tower, which was priced at $4 million. The building has a projected sellout of nearly $27 million, with studios starting at just under $1.4 million, one-bedrooms starting at $1.6 million and two-bedrooms beginning at $1.9 million.\n\nThe building also boasts some new-fangled amenities, including a fitness center and a sauna in the basement.\nPricing The Abbey proved to be a challenge in a neighborhood mostly filled with historic townhouses and brownstone condo conversions. Two units in the building couldn\u2019t even be appraised, according to Peters, who got an exception through one of her preferred lenders.\n\u201cNone of the comps showed us anything higher than $1,675, $1,700 a foot,\u201d Peters said. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare that you get to see something like this. So I think just our gut instinct was to price it the way we felt it should be priced, and it worked.\u201d\nThe previous record-holder in terms of price per square foot appears to be unit 4 at 242 Adelphi Street, which sold for $3.4 million in 2023, or $1,946 per square foot. The top-floor duplex in the converted townhouse went for nearly 30 percent over its asking price.\nEarlier this year, an unfinished five-story townhouse at 39 South Portland Avenue\nsold for $8.75 million in an all-cash deal\n, marking the priciest residential sale in Fort Greene. The $1,365 price per square foot of that sale still falls far short of the per-square-foot prices at The Abbey.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen in Fort Greene is that buyers are willing to pay the price points for special things,\u201d Peters said.\n",

They will be relocated under the proposal, according to a filing in Delaware\u2019s bankruptcy court. The Seaquarium has been operational since 1954.\nTerra\u2019s Resilient Aquarium LLC plans to pump up to $100 million into renovating, modernizing and redeveloping the Seaquarium.

Miami-Dade County moved to evict the company last year, but the\neviction proceedings\nwere stayed as a result of the bankruptcy filing.\nThe county, and activists, have alleged the current operator failed to maintain the property in good repair and clean condition. Miami-Dade alleged that MS Leisure violated the federal Marine Mammal Act and Animal Welfare Act, citing substandard animal care. In 2023, the orca Tokitae, also known as Lolita, died in her tank of renal failure, following a decades-long effort by activists to retire her to a sanctuary.\nMS Leisure\u2019s parent company, the Mexico-based Dolphin Company, is developing a plan to transfer animals to alternative locations.\nThe actual sale and transfer of the lease has to occur 30 days after the final county approval, and no later than May 15, 2026.\nMartin\u2019s other projects include the\nplanned redevelopment\nof Jungle Island on Watson Island in Miami. This week, the city\u2019s planning, zoning and appeals board\napproved a resolution\ntied to the rezoning of a portion of that property where Terra and its partner ESJ Capital Partners plans condo towers.\n",

        "content": "Private equity billionaire Greg Mondre dropped $58 million on an oceanfront lot in Palm Beach, after spec developer Brian Stock abandoned efforts to build a mansion on the property.\nMondre bought the 1.2-acre parcel at 965 North Ocean Boulevard from Stock\u2019s 965 North Ocean Boulevard LLC, sources confirmed. Listing sites show the deal has closed, but the deed has yet to appear in public records.\nLawrence A. Moens\nwith Lawrence A. Moens Associates had the listing, and Marley Overman with Illustrated Properties brought the buyer.\nMondre is co-CEO of the Menlo Park-based private equity firm Silver Lake. Forbes estimates his net worth at $2.3 billion. He sits on the boards of GoodRx, Fanatics, Vantage Data Centers North America and media firm Red Ventures, according to Silver Lake\u2019s website. Ric Elias, the billionaire Red Ventures co-founder and CEO, sold his Palm Beach mansion for\n$73 million\nin March.\nIt\u2019s not Mondre\u2019s first Palm Beach purchase. Sources confirmed he was the hidden buyer in the\n$31 million\npurchase of the house at 1160 North Ocean Boulevard in March. Overman, along with Serhant\u2019s Gary Pohrer, has the listing for the home, which is being advertised as a teardown for $39.5 million, according to Zillow.\n\nRecords show Mondre also owns a home in the exclusive Lost Tree Village community in North Palm Beach. He bought the house at 11739 Lost Tree Way for $7.2 million in 2018, according to property records. That brings his total spend in Palm Beach County to at least $96.2 million.\nThe 1.2-acre lot at 965 North Ocean Boulevard has 150 feet of waterfront. Stock, who heads Naples-based Stock Development, bought the site for $34.2 million in 2021, according to property records. His efforts to build a spec mansion on the site stalled out after Palm Beach\u2019s Architectural Commission rejected proposed designs.\nMondre\u2019s neighbors on either side of the North Ocean Boulevard property will be Phillies owners John and Leigh Middleton, who bought their home at 947 North Ocean Boulevard for $19.3 million in 2010, and chemical heiress Nicole du Pont Limbocker at 977 North Ocean Boulevard, property records show.\nDeals are ramping up in Palm Beach as the island\u2019s busy season approaches. Earlier this month, billionaire SC Johnson heiress Winifred Johnson-Marquart dropped\n$30 million\non a landmarked home on the island.",

Weingart allegedly used city and state Homekey dollars to complete the acquisition.\nTaylor reportedly hid a double-escrow deal from lenders.

At stake is $185 million in funding, which would make up about 13 percent of the Chicago agency\u2019s 2025-26 budget.\n\u201cThe HUD certifications cite several recent Executive Orders but provide no additional information or clarification on these requirements beyond the language in the application,\u201d according to the press release.\n\nThe CHA is also anticipating similar restrictions to future HUD allocations which could affect up to $1 billion in funding for the agency, which serves 135,000 Chicago residents. Local housing authorities typically get the majority of their funding from HUD.\nThe local agency is seeking a temporary restraining order.\n\u201cWe are asking the court to step in and provide guidance on the lawfulness of the conditions HUD is seeking to impose,\u201d said\nCHA Operating Chairman Matthew Brewer\nin the news release. \u201cThis intervention is a necessary last resort since our discussions with HUD have been limited due to the government shutdown.\u201d\nThe press release also noted that a similar case is ongoing in Rhode Island and requests that a judge consider the outcome of that litigation, as well.\nThe lawsuit landed amid leadership flux and political crosswinds for the CHA. Brewer, a commercial litigation attorney and longtime CHA board commissioner, was appointed as the agency\u2019s operating chairman in September after months of turbulence.\nMayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s pick to lead the CHA, former\n27th Ward Alderman Walter Burnett Jr.\n, has been sidelined from assuming its CEO position, at least temporarily, since Brewer asked HUD to review Burnett\u2019s potential conflicts of interest tied to his three decades as a Chicago City Council member and ownership of three properties rented by CHA voucher holders.\nThe leadership churn comes during heightened scrutiny of the CHA board due to revelations that one of its members,\nDebra Parker\n, has family members and a boyfriend with businesses that have scored nearly $22 million in contracts with the agency in recent years.",

        "content": "Broadway\u2019s skyline could soon rise higher, despite neighborhood pushback.\nThe Chicago City Council approved a sweeping rezoning plan Thursday that will allow taller, denser developments and a wider mix of commercial uses along a 3-mile stretch of the corridor from Devon to Montrose avenues in\nEdgewater and Uptown\n, Block Club Chicago\nreported\n.\nThe long-debated measure \u2014 passed after months of contentious public meetings and postponed votes \u2014 aims to spur housing and mixed-use projects along the Red Line in neighborhoods where prices have climbed sharply and affordability has eroded.\nSupporters say the plan will boost\nhousing supply\nand retail vitality along a key transit corridor. Opponents warn it could overwhelm neighborhood infrastructure and sideline residents in future development decisions.\nThe new zoning map reclassifies most of Broadway between Winona Street and Montrose Avenue to allow buildings up to about 80 feet tall and a variety of uses including bars, dispensaries, tattoo parlors and salons. A new pedestrian-street overlay will prohibit curb cuts and surface parking and require drive-thru businesses to maintain a walkable streetscape.\n\nMost of Broadway will shift to mixed-use community shopping district zoning, following community feedback about the larger lot sizes there. Their designation permits ground-floor retail with\napartments\nor condos above but restrict liquor and bar uses to cases approved through special-use permits.\nThe final version of the ordinance followed a heated neighborhood battle. One group,\nSave Edgewater\n, hired a lawyer and paid for billboards opposing the changes, warning they would usher in out-of-scale density. Pro-upzoning residents launched their own online campaign, petitions and even tongue-in-cheek flyers mocking resistance efforts.\nUnder the new rules, any\nproject\ntopping 80 feet or exceeding 100 residential units will still face a full planned development review, requiring public input and city approval. City planners framed the policy as a balance between enabling growth and preserving character.\nOfficials said the rezoning should make it easier to add housing and amenities near transit without piecemeal negotiations for each site, allowing for more predictability in development planning.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The seller was Los Gatos Lodge LLC, an entity managed by Half Moon Bay resident Keet Nerhan. The price works out to $8.9 million per acre.\nThe 128-room Los Gatos Lodge, at 50 Saratoga-Los Gatos Road in Los Gatos, was built in 1936 and spans more than 46,000 square feet. The owner had an asking price of $100 million, or $781,250 per key, in 2022.\nThe town of\nLos Gatos\nsigned off on SummerHill\u2019s development proposal in March, which includes the demolition of the vintage motel and construction of a 155-unit residential community.\nThe development is planned as 28 three-story attached buildings with four to six for-sale townhome-style condominiums per building. Each unit would span between 1,300 and 2,200 square feet.\n\nSummerHill Homes will take advantage of the state density bonus, granting the developer the ability to skirt zoning restrictions and receive waivers for certain regulations if their developments include affordable units for very-low-income to moderate-income households. The firm will build 26 below-market-rate condos to meet that requirement. A household of four people in\nSanta Clara County\nis considered very-low-income with $100,450 annually.\n\u201cIt meets that state law requirement, and this is one of the better state law requirements that\u2019s coming to us,\u201d Los Gatos town councilmember Rob Rennie said of the plan.\nOn the other side of the Bay, in SummerHill\u2019s home city of San Ramon, the developer is building another residential community as part of\nBishop Ranch\u2019s transformation\nfrom office park to mixed-use community.\nThat development, a 404-townhome community called City Village, began construction in 2022 and will open next spring; units at the community have already been pre-sold.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

While parts of the peninsula now house a marina, single-family homes, a restaurant and an apartment complex, the central section \u2014 which included plans for a hotel, conference center and man-made lagoon \u2014 remains largely untouched.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just nothing else that\u2019s happened,\u201d Winget said. \u201cThat heart of the development that was supposed to drive our tax base hasn\u2019t come to fruition.\u201d\n\nSapphire Bay\u2019s president declined to comment to KXAS, saying only that the company\u2019s attorneys were preparing a response to the city\u2019s notice.\nThe default marks the latest in a series of setbacks for the high-profile project. In 2023, a fire damaged the\nView at Sapphire Bay\n, a 400-unit apartment complex from Dallas homebuilder Zale Properties that was nearing completion, though some units have since opened.\nDespite the standoff,\nRowlett\nofficials insist the city\u2019s vision for a regional entertainment destination on Lake Ray Hubbard is intact. The area\u2019s zoning caps further residential development, forcing any future buildout to lean heavily on commercial and hospitality uses.\n\u201cWe still believe the peninsula is incredibly valuable,\u201d Winget said. \u201cWe want to see something really great go in there \u2014 whether it\u2019s with this developer or a different developer.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "RFR\u2019s Michael Fuchs is in danger of losing yet another home as the financial fallout of his high-profile divorce drags on.\nCity National Bank filed a foreclosure lawsuit against him and his limited liability company that owns 797 Meadow Lane in Southampton, Newsday\nreported\n. Fuchs is listed as the borrower on loan documents tied to the property on the famed Hamptons street.\nThe developer landed a $4 million adjustable-rate mortgage when he purchased the property in 2014 for $6 million. As of a week and a half ago, Fuchs owed $3.7 million, according to the bank.\nFuchs has been looking to sell the property for months. In March, he listed the property alongside a larger 4,700-square-foot estate\nfor $44 million\n. The larger property at 809 Meadow Lane ultimately sold in the summer for $26 million, but not 797 Meadow Lane.\nAfter that sale, HSBC, which provided a $20 million loan to help pay for his multimillion-dollar divorce settlement, alleged Fuchs failed to pay off the loan when it came due in December.\nThe London-based bank\nfiled a motion\nfor a summary judgment against Fuchs and a limited liability company tied to the estate, which guaranteed the loan. It is demanding just over $20 million in unpaid principal plus interest, according to the filing in state Supreme Court.\n\nLast month, meanwhile, the smaller 700-square-foot cottage on Shinnecock Bay reappeared on the market with an $8.5 million ask.\nFuchs and Alvina Collardeau divorced in 2020 after eight years of marriage, putting homes in the Hamptons, Manhattan, Paris, Miami, Cap d\u2019Antibes on the French Riviera, Capri and London into play.\nTwo years later, a British High Court judge granted Collardeau a $44 million judgment. Another judge ordered the sale of the cottage last month after Collardeau alleged Fuchs was missing mandated payments.\nIn the spring, Citibank \u2014 which provided a $3.26 million mortgage to Fuchs for a prewar condo at 302 West 12th Street in the West Village \u2014 filed a\nforeclosure suit\nafter the RFR co-founder stopped making monthly payments in May 2024, according to the complaint filed in New York State Supreme Court.\nThe lender is calling for the sale of the 1,000-square-foot pad, which Fuchs bought from comedian Seth Meyers in 2018.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Bastion\u2019s other South Florida concepts are the two-Michelin-starred L\u2019Atelier de Jo\u00ebl Robuchon and the Michelin-starred Le Jardinier in the Miami Design District.\nThe 178-seat Seia restaurant and the Seia club, with interiors designed by Zervudachi, Roberts and Macadam, are expected to open next year, the release says. The venue also will have an exclusive caf\u00e9 for tenants.\n830 Brickell tenants will receive Seia club invitations, with membership costing a $25,000 initiation fee and $5,000 in annual dues, according to the Bastion spokesperson.\n\nOKO and London-based Cain International, led by Jonathan Goldstein, finished development of 830 Brickell last year at 830 Brickell Plaza in Miami, after a roughly two-year completion delay. It is the first standalone office building in the Brickell Financial District in more than a decade.\nThe tower reaped a\nleasing bonanza\ndue to its fortunate timing: It was under construction during the pandemic-era influx of out-of-state companies to South Florida, many of whom sought top tier office spaces and signed up for space at 830 Brickell. The tower is fully leased.\nTenants include law firms Kirkland &amp; Ellis and Sidley Austin, Microsoft, insurance firms Marsh and A-Cap, and financial services firm Corient (previously called CI Financial). Also, billionaire hedge funder Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel and Citadel Securities have offices at 830 Brickell, after Griffin moved the firms\u2019 headquarters from Chicago to Miami in 2022.\nThe Seia restaurant and club announcement comes after a previously planned hospitality concept at 830 Brickell fizzled out.\nIn December, OKO and Tao Group Hospitality said they will open a Mediterranean restaurant and\nclub with a members-only loung\ne on the top two floors. At some point after that, the firms nixed the project. Tao is led by Noah Tepperberg and Jason Strauss.",

        "content": "Austin planners are scrambling to recalibrate downtown development rules after a new state law stripped cities of their power to regulate density.\nSenate Bill 840, which took effect in\nSeptember\n, bans local limits on floor-to-area ratios for residential projects \u2014 a change that upends the city\u2019s long-standing system for shaping growth in the\nCentral Business District\n, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nBefore the\nlaw\n, Austin used FAR caps to control size and density downtown, requiring developers to join the Downtown Density Bonus Program if they wanted to go bigger. The program traded extra height and density for public benefits such as affordable housing units or financial contributions to housing funds.\nWithout FAR restrictions, planners say the density program could lose its leverage \u2014 unless the city imposes new height limits.\n\u201cWe have to put in a height limit to make the Downtown Density Bonus Program continue to work,\u201d city planner Alan Pani said during a Planning Commission meeting.\nCity staff proposed a 350-foot height cap for Central Business District projects, with anything taller required to go through the density-bonus program.\nBut the Planning Commission recommended doubling the limit to 700 feet for projects in downtown\u2019s core and the Rainey Street area to maintain developer flexibility and avoid stifling growth. The final decision will rest with the City Council.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see us miss out on additional density, more riders for transit, more tax revenue and more neighbors,\u201d Commissioner Danielle Skidmore said.\nAustin\u2019s skyline already soars well above those thresholds.\n\nOnly three towers top 700 feet. The 74-story Waterline, a Lincoln Property and Kairoi Residential project slated to deliver 352 luxury apartments next year stands at 1,021 feet. Meta\u2019s\nSixth and Guadalupe\nreaches 875 feet. And\nThe Republic\nstands at\n710 feet\n.\nThe median height for projects erected since 2017 has been north of 350 feet. Last year, it averaged just over 500 feet, according to city data.\nDevelopers say taller projects are inevitable and economical.\nUrbanspace CEO Kevin Burns\ntold the outlet that shrinking land availability favors vertical construction, with \u201coptimal efficiency\u201d for towers slightly above 600 feet.\n\u201cGoing taller gets expensive fast,\u201d Burns said, citing the higher costs for concrete, elevators and fire suppression systems.\nCity officials hope a new framework will preserve Austin\u2019s density incentives and downtown momentum without running afoul of state law.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The Coca-Cola Building, built in 1939, was designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1975.\nReyes Coca-Cola Bottling, which operates out of the building and distributes the soda to the West Coast and Midwest, plans to restore the exterior of the nearly century-old structure and remodel the interior for continued use.\nThe building will also receive a new rooftop deck ahead of upcoming international sporting events in the city.

Derrah. It might also update the building\u2019s paint scheme. Mechanical equipment that would be added to the rooftop in the future would be relocated to avoid visibility from passersby. The rooftop deck will boast additional privacy by being set back from the exterior to avoid visibility from the street.\nThe interior of the building, converted into office space years ago, will get a makeover as part of the endeavor, with plans calling for a phased redesign with a more open floor plan. Gensler is designing the building\u2019s new look, while Chattel Incorporated and\nRyan Companies\nare handling project planning.\nDerrah originally designed the building in 1936 and construction was completed three years later.

        "content": "The man who made\nJamie Dimon\nworry about a wave of commercial mortgage fraud is a California multifamily player and big-time Republican donor,\nGerald Marcil\n, who is now facing serious legal allegations.\nMarcil was among the defendants named in a complaint filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court this week accusing the investor of manipulating loan structures that left Zions Bancorporation and\nWestern Alliance Bancorporation\nout in the cold when properties tied to their financing went bust, Bloomberg\nreported\n.\nZions subsidiary\nCalifornia Bank &amp; Trust\nclaims it lent more than $60 million to an investor group that listed 16 properties as collateral; six of those assets were investments under Newport Beach-based limited liability company MOM CA Investco, which filed for bankruptcy in February.\nWhen California Bank &amp; Trust underwrote the loans in 2016 and 2017, the company ensured it enjoyed lender protections, namely that it would be first in line for repayment if the borrower defaulted and liquidated its assets.\nSan Diego-based California Bank &amp; Trust said it later discovered other lenders actually held liens on several of those same buildings, thus rendering Zions\u2019 protection obsolete when the assets went into liquidation.\nPhoenix-based Western Alliance Bancorp filed a similar complaint in August, saying the same investor group, led by Gerald Marcil, Andrew Stupin and Deba Shyam, owes it nearly $99 million. The bank alleges the group hid the fact that some of the collateral properties were already in foreclosure, in turn undermining the bank\u2019s repayment rights.\nMOM CA Investco was launched in 2021 by Mohammad Honarkar and Mahender Makhijani. At the time, Makhijani acquired and managed distressed real estate for investors through an entity called Continuum Analytics. Marcil and Stupin were among Continuum\u2019s largest investors, while Shyam is its legal owner.\n\nThe relationship fell apart after Honarkar accused his partners of fraud. Makhijani at one point used armed guards to take over some of the properties and reportedly hired mobile billboards to drive around\nLaguna Beach\ndisplaying pictures of Honarkar and accusing him and two city employees of corruption.\nThe firm\u2019s Chapter 11 bankruptcy case, which covered a hotel in Laguna Beach and a $65 million apartment complex in Redlands, was dismissed in August after the parties failed to reach a restructuring deal.\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is keeping a close eye on the market as regional banks are tied to borrowers accused of fraud.\n\u201cMy antenna goes up when things like that happen,\u201d Dimon told analysts on a call this week,\nper\nCNN. \u201cAnd I probably shouldn\u2019t say this, but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more\u2026 Everyone should be forewarned on this.\u201d\nMarcil and Stupin contest the charges.\n\u201cMy clients vehemently deny all the allegations of wrongdoing,\u201d Brandon Tran, an attorney representing Marcil and Stupin, told Bloomberg. \u201cThese claims are unfounded and misrepresent the facts. We are confident that once all the evidence is presented, our clients will be fully vindicated.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Sterling Bay is running out of time to salvage what\u2019s left of its long-troubled Lincoln Yards megaproject.\nThe Chicago developer failed to pay off a $59 million loan tied to the only\ncompleted building\non the 53-acre site \u2014 an empty eight-story life sciences structure at 1229 West Concord Place \u2014 and its lender is preparing to take over, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe loan matured Sept. 23 and \u201cis unlikely to be extended,\u201d Bank OZK said in a recent regulatory filing, adding that it expects to acquire title to the property if Sterling Bay and its partners can\u2019t sell or lease it soon.\nThe developer, working with\nJ.P. Morgan Asset Management\nand Harrison Street Real Estate Capital, has been marketing the 320,000-square-foot building along the North Branch as a turnkey opportunity for a major tenant. But so far, no takers.\nThe potential seizure would mark another blow to Sterling Bay\u2019s $6 billion Lincoln Yards vision, which won City Council approval in 2019 but has since stalled amid shifting market conditions.\nEarlier this year, Sterling Bay surrendered the northern portion of the project site to Bank OZK to settle another outstanding loan. The bank has since sold that\n28-acre tract\nto JDL Development and Kayne Anderson Real Estate, which plan to redevelop it as\nFoundry Park\n, with nearly 3,300 residential units.\nSterling Bay declined to comment.\n\nThe Concord building was conceived as a biotech hub meant to anchor the southern half of Lincoln Yards. Instead, it sat vacant for more than a year as Chicago\u2019s fledgling life sciences scene has clustered in more established neighborhoods like Fulton Market and the Illinois Medical District.\nMarketing materials from Eastdil Secured and Savills tout the property as a \u201cblank slate\u201d for an anchor tenant seeking modern lab or office space.\nBank OZK\nexecutives have hinted they\u2019re open to repositioning the property.\n\u201cGetting a user in the space to pay rent is what it\u2019s all about,\u201d president Brannon Hamblen told analysts, noting that the bank could repurpose funds earmarked for lab buildouts toward traditional office tenants instead.\nThe lender wrote down about $5.1 million on the debt, which now carries a $59 million balance after applying reserves, according to the filing.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

A formal call for offers is expected next month.\nThere\u2019s no asking price, but the site\u2019s scale and flexibility could attract a single corporate user or a redevelopment play. The Colin Central Appraisal District assessed the building\u2019s\ntaxable value\nat $51 million. It was constructed in 1995 and extensive upgrades were logged in 2007.\n\u201cIn this part of the metroplex, there are not many 300,000-square-foot vacancies available, and there are not any available options that come with this much excess land,\u201d Haworth told the outlet. \u201cThe location is best suited to attract a large single user, rather than a mix of tenants.\u201d\n\nThe sale followed Globe Life\u2019s decision to move its headquarters to\n7677 Henneman Way\nthis summer, a 200,000-square-foot office the firm purchased in July from Florida-based SouthState Corp. That building, 4 miles north of the Stonebridge site, is part of the former Independent Bank campus that SouthState acquired earlier this year for $2 billion.\nGlobe Life will relocate more than 3,000 employees to the new building by year\u2019s end.\nThe\nStonebridge\nproperty\u2019s listing adds to a wave of major suburban office availability across the metroplex. Other large campuses up for grabs include the former JCPenney headquarters in Plano, American Airlines\u2019 previous campus in Fort Worth, and ExxonMobil\u2019s old Irving property.\nThe region now has roughly 62 million square feet of vacant office space, with another 2 million under development, according to CBRE.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Clearly, Marc Holliday wasn\u2019t interested in another defeat this fall.\nSpeaking of casino bids, one of the few to move on to the next round of the process suddenly tossed its cards this week.\nMGM Resorts \u2014 considered a shoo-in for one of three casino licenses \u2014\nwithdrew its proposal\nfor a $2.3 billion expansion of its facility in Yonkers.\nThe gaming giant blamed the decision on \u201ca newly defined competitive landscape,\u201d noting the remaining proposals were clustered in a \u201csmall geographic area.\u201d\nMGM also relied on receiving an initial 30-year license, but based on rules issued by the state last week, the Yonkers proposal would only qualify for 15 years.\nThe Queens Aqueduct, Steve Cohen\u2019s Metropolitan Park in Flushing and Bally\u2019s Bronx project are all that remain. The state does not have to award all three available licenses, meaning the competitors can\u2019t start counting their chips just yet.\n\nIn other news, a lender is\npursuing\ntwo non-judicial foreclosures on equity interests tied to two phases of Fordham Landing, a multi-billion-dollar mixed-use development along the Harlem River in the Bronx. Dynamic Star, led by Gary Segal and Brad Zackson, is developing the megaproject with Namdar and Gorjian Acquisitions.\nA mysterious lender alleges debts are owed on a $55.1 million loan tied to 320 West Fordham Road, as well as $18.9 million tied to a loan for 2371 Exterior Street, 2391 and 2401 Exterior Street and 2444 Exterior Street.\nTwo foreclosure auctions are scheduled for Dec. 2.\nWhile Fordham Landing is facing threats, the Brooklyn Mirage\nappears doomed\n. The East Williamsburg building\u2019s owner filed for a demolition permit for at least part of the live music venue, part of a bigger space called Avant Gardner. The application is for a full demolition of 32,000 square feet.\nThe demolition would be the culmination of a tumultuous series of months, which included canceled shows, bankruptcy filings and overrun renovation costs.\nOn the culture beat, the Metropolitan Museum of Art is getting involved in its own real estate wheeling and dealing.\nThe museum\nsigned a deal\nto sell a pair of townhomes on East 82nd Street on the Upper East Side last asking $28 million. The buyer signed a contract two weeks after the homes went up for sale and plans to convert them into one single-family residence.\n",

The buyer was a trust. Humer, CFO at Boston-based biotechnology research firm Foghorn Therapeutics, paid $8.9 million for the pad in 2016; it went on the market in May with an asking price of $17.5 million.

Douglas Elliman\u2019s\nNoble Black, Justin Figari\nand\nConnor Cuccinelli\nhad the listing.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe sale of a hotel off Madison Square Park was the top commercial deal recorded in the city. Arcadia, California-based developer\nKam Sang Co.,\npaid $231 million for the 252,000-square-foot hotel at\n5 Madison Avenue\nknown as the Edition Clocktower Hotel. The seller was the\nAbu Dhabi Investment Authority\n, which had purchased the 273-key building in 2015 for $337 million.\nHudson Bay Capital Management\nprovided a $155 million mortgage for the purchase.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nMD2 Property Group\noffloaded two apartment buildings at\n4 West 108th Street\nand\n8 West 108th Street\nin Manhattan Valley for $17.5 million. The buyer was Los Angeles-based\nBando Geny 3 LLC.\nThe adjacent properties stand six stories tall and have 48 apartments combined.\nKEB Hana Bank\nprovided a $10.7 million loan. The seller had owned the properties since 2019, when they purchased them for $11 million.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nIn the Financial District, a 12-story office property traded for $40.2 million. LLCs tied to\nRobert Wolf\nand\nAM Property Holdings Corp.\n, led by\nPaul Wasserman\n, had owned the building for decades. The new owner is\nCSC 75 Maiden Prop Co LLC,\nregistered to a Columbus Avenue address.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nEtsy CEO\nJoshua Silverman\nand\nShirin Ghotbi\nsold a condo overlooking the Museum of Natural History at\n101 West 78th Street\nin the Upper West Side.\nVitaly Kuznetsov\n, an algorithm developer at Hudson River Trading, and\nMasayo Oto\ndropped $8.4 million on the unit, which Silverman and Ghotbi had bought in 2018 for $10.5 million.

Homeowners there are staying in their houses for an average of 12.48 years, the 10th-longest tenure in the country.

        "content": "The gloves are coming off for house hunters in Brooklyn.\nLast month, one in four homes in the borough sold for more than its asking price \u2014 a metric typically indicating a property traded after a bidding war. Of the 10 New York City neighborhoods with the highest share of homes sold over asking, six were in Brooklyn, according to a\nStreeteasy report\npublished Thursday.\nHeightened competition among buyers is a natural next step for the borough\u2019s residential market, where\nprices have been climbing\nsince pandemic changes drove up demand. Brooklyn logged nearly 500 inked deals in September, up 11 percent from the same period last year.\nSome high-profile buyers have even swapped their Manhattan homes for pads in Brooklyn, setting new records. Last year, Glossier founder Emily Weiss and her partner, fintech executive William Gaybrick, paid\n$22 million\nfor a Brooklyn Heights townhouse just five months after buying a Greenwich Village abode for $18 million, which they subsequently put back on the market.\nProspect Heights claimed the largest share of homes selling over asking, at 47 percent. The median asking price was $1.3 million. Earlier this year, Redfin labeled the neighborhood, along with the adjacent Clinton Hill,\nthe most desirable\nin the country. The number of home sales in the enclave doubled in a year.\nNext up was Park Slope with 44 percent of homes selling above their asking prices. A townhouse at 535 First Street broke neighborhood records last month when Jared Vinik, the son of Tampa Bay Lightning owner Jeff Vinik, bought it for\n$14 million\n.\nBoth Park Slope and Prospect Heights ranked higher in homes with above-ask closing prices than some desirable Manhattan enclaves, including the\nWest Village\nand Greenwich Village.\nRounding out the top five on Streeteasy\u2019s list was Brooklyn Heights, long recognized for its pricey townhomes, where 33 percent of homes sold over asking. The other Brooklyn neighborhoods included were Crown Heights, Williamsburg and Sheepshead Bay.\nAcross the five boroughs, the residential market is heading into the fourth quarter on a promising note. More than 1,700 homes found buyers last month, up 10 percent from year-ago numbers, and the highest total for September since 2021.\n\nSo far, it appears supply is keeping up with demand, with roughly 4,600 homes hitting the market last month, marking a 10 percent increase from last year.\nNot so fast\u2026\nJust what the West Village needs: another double-wide townhouse.\nA whopping 13,000-square-foot home in the neighborhood\nhit the market\non Friday with a $75 million price tag. If it trades for that price, it will set a new record for Downtown Manhattan, displacing another megamansion that sold for $73 million just last year.\nBefore the home at 105-107 Bank Street was combined into one, each side of the monster residence housed its own storied residents, including John Lennon and Yoko Ono and composer John Cage.\nThe creation of these massive single-family residences has drawn criticism, especially in recent years, as the city grapples with a housing crunch. In Manhattan, researchers found that for each of these combinations, the borough lost between six and seven housing units.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe priciest deal recorded in the city rolls this week was for a penthouse at 111 West 56th Street, which sold for $12.3 million, or $4,400 per square foot. The condo, which hit the market last April asking just under $15 million, has four bedrooms, four bathrooms and two terraces.\nUnit PHC is one of 99 condos atop the\nThompson Central Park Hotel\n. Amenities at the development, known as One11 Residences, include a fitness center, private lounge and access to the hotel\u2019s concierge service.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Maria Mainieri, Taylor Middleton and Peter Evangelidis are heading sales for the developer, GFI Capital Resources.",

        "content": "A restaurateur signs a 15-year lease, then has a debilitating stroke. What happens next plays out in two very different versions, depending on who\u2019s telling the story.\nWhen Keith McNally suffered a major stroke in 2016, the famed restaurateur behind Pastis, Balthazar and Minetta Tavern feared his career and his body had collapsed for good. To make matters worse, the man who once ruled New York\u2019s dining scene suddenly found himself trapped in a business deal he could no longer execute. He\u2019d leased a Meatpacking District space to reopen his iconic restaurant Pastis, backed by a $1 million personal guarantee.\nIn his memoir \u201cI Regret Almost Everything,\u201d McNally recounts the episode as a near-tragic twist. Unable to walk or speak clearly, McNally put his daughter Sophie in charge of the business. He says she begged the landlords, Aurora Capital\u2019s Bobby Cayre and Jared Epstein, to release him from the lease. They refused, he wrote, at the urging of a mysterious \u201cthird partner,\u201d later identified as William Gottlieb Real Estate\u2019s Neil Bender. Facing financial strain and depression, McNally describes feeling cornered.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly afford to lose a million dollars, yet I was in no condition to build a restaurant,\u201d he wrote.\nEpstein tells a very different story. In his version, there was no threat to execute the guarantee, no heartless landlord tightening the screws on an ailing tenant.\n\u201cWe were never going to go after his personal guarantee,\u201d Epstein said in a phone interview. \u201cForget it being not a good thing to do as a business person. I believe it\u2019s a terrible thing to do as a human being \u2014 to prey on someone after they had a terrible medical problem in their life.\u201d\nAccording to Epstein, Sophie reached out soon after her father\u2019s health crisis to say she would carry the project forward. But when their investor pulled out, she needed time to find new funding. Rather than push back, Epstein said, Aurora worked with the McNallys to find potential partners. One of those introductions, to restaurateur Stephen Starr, ultimately revived the project. Starr partnered with McNally to reopen Pastis in 2019, to instant acclaim and two stars from The New York Times.\nFollowing the restaurant\u2019s success, McNally and Starr went on to open locations in Miami and Washington, D.C.\nEpstein said he was especially miffed by McNally\u2019s description of him in the book as \u201cobnoxious.\u201d He suspects the jab stems from a later clash, when he privately messaged McNally after the restaurateur posted something \u201cvery insensitive\u201d on Instagram following Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack on Israel, he said.\nFor Epstein, the book\u2019s portrayal of events feels like misplaced resentment.\n\u201cWe saved his legacy brand,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cInstead of vengeance, he should actually be sending us flowers thanking us.\u201d\n\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: Rhode Island-based MCM just\nsold a portfolio\nof four nonunion Manhattan hotels for $489.8 million to a group of institutional investors, the largest Big Apple hotel sale since the\nSafe Hotels Act\nwent into effect in May. Before the bill passed, critics warned that its staffing mandates could cripple many of the city\u2019s hotels, driving up overhead and eroding their value. In the end, was it all much ado about nothing? Send a note to\nelizabeth.cryan@therealdeal.com\nwith your thoughts.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nJPMorgan is requiring employees to provide an iris or fingerprint scan to access its new, $3 billion Manhattan headquarters, the\nFinancial Times reported\n. The bank is also requiring employees to use a mobile app to access the building\u2019s services, giving the bank an unprecedented amount of personal data on each of the 10,000 employees expected to be working at the building by the end of the year.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2013 New York City has halted its plan to add dedicated bus lanes along 34th Street after the Trump administration threatened to withhold federal funding and approvals for other transit projects, according to\nThe New York Times\n. The Federal Highway Administration said the pause was prompted by concerns about the project\u2019s impact on trucks and emergency vehicles. The lanes are expected to speed up service for 28,000 daily riders by up to 15 percent.\n\u2013 Former financier Howard Rubin\u2019s estranged wife, Mary Henry, urged a judge to release the accused sex trafficker on a $50 million bond, describing him as a devoted grandfather, the\nNew York Post\nreported. In a court letter, she said Rubin, 70, should be free to spend time with his three young grandchildren while awaiting trial.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$15.9 million\nfor a 3,251-square-foot condominium at The Greenwich Lane, 155 West 11th Street in the West Village. Noble Black, formerly with Douglass Elliman, had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$231.2 million\nfor The New York Edition hotel at 5 Madison Avenue in Flatiron. The property has 252,109 square feet and 51 stories.\nThe Real Deal\nwrote about\nthis and another recent hotel transaction.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$18 million\nfor a 4,156-square-foot condo unit at 445 Lafayette Street in Noho. Zack Sosne and Craig Roth with NextStop NY have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 24,785-square-foot, seven-story mixed-use project at 172-10 Jamaica Avenue. Mosharraf Hossain filed the permit on behalf of developer Gouranga Kundu.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "As artificial intelligence\u2019s foothold grows in San Francisco, so too do rent prices.\nAI startup Cluely, for example, is\nplaying a part in the rent increase\n, the New York Times\nreported\n.\nAfter landing $5.3 million in seed funding this spring, its 22-year-old founder Roy Lee inked leases for eight high-end apartments in San Francisco\u2019s South of Market neighborhood, steps from the company\u2019s office.\nUnits in the 16-story building fetch anywhere between $3,000 to $12,000 a month and come with concierge and cleaning services.\nApartment prices in San Francisco have climbed an average of 6 percent over the past year, more than double the 2.5 percent increase in New York City, according to CoStar data cited by the outlet.\nAverage rent for a San Francisco apartment is now $3,315 a month, just a few dollars behind the nation\u2019s highest, in New York City, at $3,360. In hot spots like Mission Bay, near\nOpenAI\n\u2019s headquarters, rents climbed 13 percent recently.\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019ve never seen anything like it before,\u201d said Will Goodman, a principal at\nStrada Investment Group\n, which developed the luxury complex where Cluely leased. Half of the 501-unit complex\u2019s units were leased within two months of its May opening, he told the outlet.\n\nLines are forming around the block for apartment showings, with some renters flashing cash deposits on the spot. Last month, rent prices in the city\nsurpassed pre-pandemic highs\n.\nFor service workers and younger professionals, the crush is pushing affordability out of reach.\nRenters like Caroline Roche, a 25-year-old demand planner at Backroads, toured 25 apartments in a week to find a one-bedroom within her budget. Others have resorted to guerrilla tactics, such as posting flyers with their photos and phone numbers on telephone poles, to land a lease.\nIt\u2019s not just renters who are feeling the pinch of high demand and high prices.\nBuyers looking for luxury homes in San Francisco are having a\nharder time than ever to find mansions\n, as sales for those pricey abodes are up 14 percent year-over-year, while inventory is down 4.5 percent year-over-year.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The firm would have to pay the full amount to stave off a foreclosure auction.\nScape bought the SoFA site in 2020 for $16.5 million and landed the Madison Realty Capital financing the following year to build The Fay.\nThe tower opened late last year, adding residences to the district largely known for retail, restaurant, nightlife and entertainment.

Hillwood started Alliance 35 years ago as a cargo airport, now owned by the City of Fort Worth, and it grew into a mixed-use logistics hub with everything from a retail town center to soundstages for prolific \u201cYellowstone\u201d creator Taylor Sheridan.\nPerot warned that tariffs and overregulation could hold Texas back from \u201ceconomic freedom,\u201d and he hinted that the U.S. Chamber\u2019s lobbying helped persuade President Donald Trump to put a\n90-day pause\non his initial tariff plan.\nPoliticians aren\u2019t always speaking to reality regarding tariffs and immigration, Perot said.\n\n\u201cThey know the immigration problem, they know the tariff problem, and they\u2019re all working hard to try to get it fixed,\u201d Perot said,\naccording to\nthe Fort Worth Star-Telegram. \u201cBackstage, they know it. Onstage, you might get rhetoric, but our job at the chamber is to really work pure data backstage. And we\u2019re trusted by the elected officials. If we tell them something, they\u2019re going to know this isn\u2019t PR spin.\u201d\nPerot was early on Taylor Sheridan as well.\nSheridan has already filmed scenes from \u201cLandman\u201d in Alliance buildings undergoing a\n$65 million conversion\nto filming studios. Their deal was years in the making as Perot was bullish on Sheridan from the get-go.\n\u201cYou have a Fort Worth citizen, Taylor Sheridan, and his shows really do resonate with the Texas crowd and the U.S. crowd, and it\u2019s just a fluke we have him,\u201d Perot said in a talk to real estate students at\nTexas Christian University\nthis week.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I said: \u2018This guy generates so much activity. How do we embrace him as a city? How do we have filming here? And where will it go?\u201d\nMansion goes to auction\nThe softening luxury real estate market in North Texas led the sellers of a house in McKinney to\nbring it to auction\nto find a buyer. The Collin County house, last listed for $4.5 million, is owned by members of a car club and has a 6,500-square-foot auto showroom.\nHouston office market perks up\nDemand for office is picking up in Houston, which logged positive absorption for the second straight quarter. A massive\nheadquarters lease\nin Sugar Land led the pack recently.\n",

        "content": "Will\nSenate Bill 79\nbe the new builder\u2019s remedy for developers? It appears that it could be.\nThis may be why there was a scramble by the city of Los Angeles to push back on the transit-oriented housing bill after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed it into law last week. Much like builder\u2019s remedy, SB 79 provides the key to streamlined development, pushing through higher density residential developments at a faster clip. In SB79\u2019s case, the law uses proximity to a transit stop, whereas builder\u2019s remedy requires a city to be out of compliance with its housing element (a masterplan for future housing development).\nThe Los Angeles City Planning Department published\ndraft maps\nof the blocks that could be impacted by SB 79.\nThe new law allows for multifamily residential of as high as nine stories and as many as 160 units for parcels closest to a high traffic transit stop, considered a \u201ctier 1\u201d station under the law. In the case of tier two stations, a maximum height of eight stories and 140 units is allowed.\nCity Planning counted 33 stations in Los Angeles that can be categorized as tier 1 and another 117 tier 2 stations.\nCities have until July 1, 2026, when the new law goes into effect, to sort things out.\nSteve Cohen\u2019s Beverly Hills move\nIt wasn\u2019t casino-related news, although there\u2019s a story for that elsewhere on\nThe Real Deal\n. Instead,\nSteve Cohen\nmade news of another kind when his Beverly Hills mansion, which is seeking $35 million, topped last week\u2019s Los Angeles County homes that went into contract.\nThe New York Mets billionaire owner has been in the news cycle for some time with his proposed $8 billion casino complex plans for 50 acres of parking next to Citi Field in New York. The project\u2019s still in the running for a state gaming license.\nHis home at 901 Oxford Way was purchased back in 2015 from spec developer Gala Asher, making Cohen and his wife Alexandra Cohen the Beverly Hills property\u2019s first and only residents.\nThe $10 million haircut on the ask underscores the challenges some are seeing in L.A.\u2019s high end, where price slashing and re-lists have become common.\n\nOn again, off again\nSpeaking of high-end problems, the market\u2019s recently seen a few re-lists of some pricey pads.\nThat includes billionaire Jeff Greene\u2019s 53,000-square-foot estate at\n9505 Lania Lane\n, which is back on the market for $195 million, or $3,679 per square foot. The last time Greene tried to sell the home was in 2017 for the more value-priced ask of $129 million. After it went off the market, it served as a rental.\nCount the\nWinnick estate\n, also known as Casa Encantada, as another boomerang listing.\nThe Bel-Air home at 10644 Bellagio Road re-entered the market last week for $190 million. That\u2019s down from the $250 million listing price Karen Winnick and her late husband and billionaire financier Gary Winnick originally asked back in 2023. The price was later slashed to $195 million and then, late last year, was cut to $165 million for the 60-room estate.\nNicki Minaj\u2019s debt prob\nA Holmby Hills home owned by\nNicki Minaj\ncould soon be on the market.\nChatter over the proposed sale stems from the rapper and her husband Kenneth Petty\u2019s refusal to pay a reported $503,000 award to security guard Thomas Weidenmuller, according to\nUS Weekly\n.\nWeidenmuller\u2019s now asked a judge to compel the couple to sell their home to not only address what he is owed, but also take care of the mortgage and liens on the property that amount to nearly $14 million.\nThe hip-hop star paid $19.5 million for the 11-bed, 16-bath home at 5510 Jed Smith Road about three years ago.\n",

        "content": "Cook County Board President\nToni Preckwinkle\nis displaying some familiarity with an old real estate adage: possession is nine-tenths of the law. The county owns a lot of land, and she made a move Thursday that could characterize federal agents as trespassers, should they engage in certain immigration enforcement activity.\nA few hours after Preckwinkle signed an executive order banning\nICE operations\non county property, she again touted the capacity of real estate dealmaking to shape politics, albeit in a much different arena.\nThe takeaway: Preckwinkle understands how to wield real estate as a tool for creating, maintaining and checking power.\nWhether she and other Chicago public officials properly use the tool is up for debate, of course. Take\nDavid Doig\n, who shared the stage with Preckwinkle late Thursday night as they each accepted awards in front of over 200 industry professionals at the annual Marshall Bennett Institute of Real Estate gala in developer Jeff Shapack\u2019s Fulton Market office building at 167 North Green Street.\nPreckwinkle lamented that Chicago housing development had fallen to low levels in recent years, which has sent rents skyrocketing to the fastest rates of growth in the nation.\nBut the optics of the event grow more complex when one scans Doig\u2019s real estate philosophies. The developer-activist behind the firm Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives has real estate credentials anchoring him firmly in the trenches where policy meets capital. And he\u2019s been outspoken about what he views as a broken process for financing affordable housing that has driven up costs at some projects\ncloser to $1 million per unit\n, far more than the price at which the private development market can produce.\n\nDoig\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes stints in former Mayor Richard M. Daley\u2019s city planning department, oversight of park district projects and development leveraging New Markets Tax Credits, showcasing a deep and practical engagement with the real estate sector.\nIn a\nCrain\u2019s Chicago Business\nopinion piece, he argued that the city needs a \u201chomebuilding revolution\u201d to offset decades of underproduction. He frames the issue not simply as a lack of subsidized housing but as systemic supply constraints: red tape, zoning inertia, capital stack complexity and developer risk must be rethought. He observes that building more middle-market units (with minimal public subsidy) may help \u201csoak up\u201d demand and ease pressure.\nLikewise, a\nChicago Tribune editorial\non \u201cHow ill-conceived \u2018affordable\u2019 housing becomes unaffordable\u201d critiqued programs that inadvertently drive up costs through overregulation or misaligned incentives. While not authored by Doig, the piece echoes his criticism of subsidy complexity and questions whether government-backed projects can remain affordable under heavy compliance burdens.\nAt the gala, juxtaposing Preckwinkle and Doig was not random. It showcased dueling yet potentially complementary narratives: Preckwinkle as a political boundary-setter, Doig as a policy implementer. But the contrast also sharpens doubts. If Preckwinkle\u2019s sanctuary county order stakes moral territory, Doig\u2019s work reminds us that real change requires negotiating markets, finance, regulation and on-the-ground execution.\nStill, linking them also raises tension: can a leader publicly decry suppressed housing starts while simultaneously endorsing a symbolic anti-ICE order whose enforcement is uncertain? Doig\u2019s presence offers a foil: development pragmatism facing political idealism.\nThe larger question lingers: will sanctuary-style orders meaningfully reshape immigrants\u2019 lived security \u2014 or will they serve chiefly as rallying flags? And can developers like Doig, pushing for a supply breakthrough, overcome the structural inertia that keeps Chicago undershooting housing demand?\nAt the gala, the award winners themselves told a story of converging aspirations \u2014 but whether Chicago gains homes, equity or protection depends on what happens when the impact of rhetoric fades.",

        "content": "San Francisco home sellers\naren\u2019t riding the discount wave seen in other markets nationwide.\nWhile sellers across the country are slashing list prices to attract interested buyers, only 12 percent of listings in the San Francisco metro area saw price cuts in August. By contrast, the national figure is around 17 percent.\nAt that rate, San Francisco claims the third-lowest share among major U.S. metros, behind New York and Newark, New Jersey. Overall, two-thirds of single-family homes ended up selling above list price in August, marking the highest rate in the Bay Area. Sellers in San Francisco who do slash prices usually only reduce by about 6 percent, or $100,000.\nThe median home price hovered around $1.2 million, or $100,000 below pre-pandemic levels. Typical homes spent a median of 42 days on the market.\nLuxury sales\ntell an even more bullish story.\nSales of homes priced above $5 million jumped 55 percent year-over-year in September, while total home sales rose 35 percent. The jump can likely be attributed to the influx of high-paid tech workers and executives, especially in the booming artificial intelligence sector.\nA\n$42 million off-market deal\nfor a 7,300-square-foot mansion in Pacific Heights, for example, blew past this year\u2019s previous record of $30 million. That home was sold to HOS Pacific, a limited liability company linked to Katie Schwab Paige, daughter of famed financier Charles Schwab. The same LLC owns another Pacific Heights home belonging to Katie Schwab Paige and her husband Matt Paige.\nWith limited supply and deep-pocketed buyers, sellers are sticking to their numbers. Even with flat year-over-year prices, the market\u2019s competitive streak and a record-breaking luxury tier shows that in San Francisco, waiting it out might still pay off.\nNeuralink\u2019s new digs\nNeuralink is in the midst of a brain \u2014 or rather, office \u2014 blast.\nElon Musk\u2019s cybernetic implant startup is\nexpanding in the Bay Area\nwith a 144,000-square-foot office at 499 Forbes Boulevard in South San Francisco. The site, vacant since biotech firm InterVenn Biosciences left in 2023, sits across from Genentech\u2019s $5 billion campus redevelopment.\nThough Musk\u2019 moved Tesla and SpaceX operations to Texas during the pandemic, Neuralink and xAI are bulking up in Silicon Valley. Musk\u2019s xAI firm is hunting for as much as 250,000 square feet of new office space in or near Palo Alto.\nNeuralink, valued above $3 billion, is pushing ahead with human trials of its brain-computer interface designed to help people with paralysis. It has 12 test patients globally and a 10,000-person waitlist for its robotic surgical arm.\n\nSchool\u2019s back in session\nThe Bay Area continues to attract attention from the University of California system as well as out-of-state entities.\nUC Investments\nbought the 331-key Residence Inn Berkeley\nhotel from Pyramid Global Hospitality in an all-cash deal for $175.8 million. It\u2019s a tumble from its 2023 appraised value of $218 million, though it would align with the lodging woes that have led to loan defaults, foreclosures, seizures, bankruptcies and complete closures at hotels across the region in recent years.\nUC\u2019s plans for the property haven\u2019t been disclosed, but it could likely turn into\nstudent housing amid a crunch for academic residences.\nThe move follows UC\u2019s purchase of nearly 100 acres in Belmont in July from Notre Dame de Namur University.\nMeanwhile, Vanderbilt University\u2019s\nplans for a satellite campus in San Francisco\nare coming into focus. The forthcoming 5M Project, a mixed-use development in South of Market, has reportedly\nemerged as a preferred site\nfor the Nashville school to plant its flag in the Bay Area.\nNewly affordable\nBishop Ranch is on its way to getting its first 100 percent affordable housing project.\nThe City of San Ramon\ngave the green light\nfor 200 new units at 2453 Camino Ramon from nonprofit developer Eden Housing. The residences will rise on a 2.2-acre site as part of the push to turn Sunset Development\u2019s office park into a mixed-use community.\nThe effort will replace Sunset Development\u2019s former 10,000-square-foot service center with a 120-unit building for working families and an 80-unit complex for residents 55 and older. Households earning 30 to 80 percent of area median income will be eligible.\nIt\u2019s a notable step as Bishop Ranch continues to grow its planned housing projects to ditch the area\u2019s staid office reputation. Other projects in the works include the conversion of 761,000 square feet of offices to make way for 485 units across two developments, one of which will include affordable housing for very-low-income households; the replacement of a 109,000-square-foot office building with 64 townhome condominiums and nine accessory dwelling units; Related California\u2019s planned 380-unit luxury apartment building;\nAvalonBay\n\u2019s 457-unit project across the street from the City Center retail complex; and Sunset\u2019s transformation of\nthe old Chevron headquarters into The Orchards\n, a development consisting of 2,510 homes, 125,000 square feet of town-center-style retail and a 2.5-acre community park.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Florida\u2019s Supreme Court declined to take up the Biscayne 21 condo buyout case.\nA brief recap to bring you up to speed: In 2022, Taylor Collins and Reid Boren\u2019s Two Roads Development acquired the majority of condos at Biscayne 21, an older Miami condo building in Edgewater. The developer-controlled condo association then voted to amend the condo declaration\u2019s termination statute, lowering the threshold to 80 percent from 100 percent. (A termination of the association is a required legal step so the developer could eventually knock the building down.)\nTwo Roads, which financed the bulk purchase with a $45 million mezz loan from Lionheart Strategic Management LLC and a $105 million senior mortgage from Bank OZK, launched sales later that year of an Edition Residences planned for the site.\nThen, the holdout owners sued the developer and the developer-controlled association. All the residents eventually had to move out, and the building is no longer habitable.\nThe lawsuit has moved its way through the courts, and the Third District Court of Appeal issued an opinion earlier this year siding with the holdout unit owners. The court affirmed that the original condo declaration required unanimous consent for termination, invalidating the developer-controlled association\u2019s amendment.\nLong story short, this was very bad news for the developer, and good news for the holdout owners.\nBut the developer vowed to take the issue to Florida\u2019s Supreme Court. Only, the state\u2019s highest court\ndeclined to hear the issue\n.\nNow, the developer has no other way to appeal, and no leverage with the holdout owners. Two Roads declined to comment on its next steps.\nThe attorneys and other experts I\u2019ve spoken to say that two paths exist: the developer settles with the holdout owners, possibly with a new equity partner who can help recapitalize the project, or the developer-controlled association is forced to repair the building and make it habitable again, operating it as a condo building that is primarily rentals. The latter seems less likely.\nDavid Podein, an attorney at Haber Law who is not involved in the case, said the market may guide the solution.\n\u201cAt the end of the day it is an extremely prime piece of waterfront property,\u201d Podein said.\nMost expect the developer to settle with the holdout owners, but how does Two Roads do that with the debt it owes?\n\nGlen Waldman, the holdout owners\u2019 lawyer, said the lenders will be a key part of how this moves forward. Waldman said the case returns to state court, and he will amend his pleadings to go after the developer for more than $100 million in damages.\nTwo Roads, he said, is \u201cin a terrible position and they deserve it. They\u2019ve destroyed [my clients] homes with no right. Now we go after them like there\u2019s no tomorrow.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nHow will Nahla Capital move the Raleigh Miami Beach project forward now that it\u2019s\ntaken the project over\nfrom Michael Shvo?

The mansion, completed two years ago, spans 14,000 square feet.\nCommercial\n: Miami-based\nCofe Properties\u2019 acquired two warehouses\n, the Milam Dairy Commerce Center I and II at 6700 Northwest 72nd Avenue and 7205 Northwest 68th Street in Medley for $26.8 million. Miami-based Prudence Investments, which had bought the properties in the 1980s and 1990s for a combined $1.9 million, sold the warehouses.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nDeveloper Armando Codina and his wife, Margarita, listed their waterfront estate at 50 Casuarina Concourse in Coral Gables\nfor $45 million\n. Their six-bedroom, eight-and-a-half-bathroom home spans about 13,400 square feet on a 1.1-acre lot. It\u2019s listed with BHHS EWM Realty\u2019s Scott Shuffield. The mansion, built in 1997, features a 2,000-bottle wine cellar, hand-painted dining room, and a large owner\u2019s suite. The couple paid $1.2 million for the property in 1995. The Codinas plan to move to a luxury apartment building Codina Partners is building in Coral Gables.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nMiami-Dade commissioners approved new legislation to make community composting easier and cheaper, according to the\nMiami Herald\n.

The measures, which would appear on the 2026 ballot, are in response to Gov.

        "content": "EY Plaza can\u2019t catch a break, or at least its lenders can\u2019t.\nIt wasn\u2019t enough for a deal to purchase the distressed downtown office tower to\nfall apart\n, no, its value also took a hit. It\u2019s now worth about $135 million, down about 10 percent from its last valuation, according to Morningstar Credit. That\u2019s a significant drop from the $446 million it was once worth.\nIt\u2019s becoming more apparent that Adam Rubin and Andrew Shanfeld\u2019s Carolwood dodged a bullet when its $130 million deal collapsed.\nThe 900,000 square foot, 41-story, Class A office building at 725 S. Figueroa Street was placed in receivership two years ago, after owner Brookfield defaulted on $275 million commercial mortgage-backed securities debt.\nOnce the deal drama played out, after\nThe Real Deal\nreported the story, it was announced that Colliers, who replaced Eastdil, was\nmarketing\nthe $275 million non-performing loan connected to the property. Colliers made it clear that it anticipated the note to trade at discount.\nIt\u2019s not unreasonable to think that news further impacted the marketability of the note. Neither Colliers nor the court-appointed receiver responded to a request for comment.\nMum\u2019s the word\nIf it weren\u2019t for two analysts and their prodding, Rexford Industrial probably wouldn\u2019t have mentioned activist investor Elliott at all during its third quarter\nearnings\ncall. But they asked the question we\u2019ve all wanted an answer to since it was revealed Elliott reportedly built an active stake in the industrial real estate investment trust and had become one of the largest shareholders.\nUnfortunately Rexford was very hush-hush and only said it has met with Elliott and has a constructive dialogue with Paul Singer\u2019s hedge fund (that tends to command attention), as it encourages with all its shareholders, but wouldn\u2019t discuss the nature of said discussions.\nNonetheless, the company reported a net income of $87.1 million for the third quarter, compared to $65.1 million a year earlier, an increase of about 34 percent. Revenues increased too, to $253.2 million in the three months ended Sept. 30 \u2014 and the company executed 3.3 million square feet of leases in the quarter and sold three properties (two in Los Angeles County) for $53.6 million. It was an earnings beat, but it did mark a change, in that Rexford is no longer on a buying spree.\n\nKilroy Realty and Hudson Pacific Properties are next to report earnings, so stay tuned.\nReceiver central\nAnother downtown Los Angeles commercial property owner could cede control to a receiver.\nLender Cathay Bank\nsued\na company connected to Laeroc Partners, borrower and owner of 530 W. 6th Street, alleging it defaulted on a $31 million loan that matured in September. Cathay Bank requested a receiver be appointed to take possession of the 13-story, 160,000-square-foot data-center and office property and for it to be foreclosed upon. It appears the property called the Telecom Center was already on the market, according to a NAI Capital brochure, which does not include an asking price.\nTour, tour, tour\nSenior editor Lauren Schram toured Related California\u2019s new 700 Broadway mixed-use development in Santa Monica that just began leasing, so we\u2019re going to give you a little taste of what we saw.\nOn par with the Southern California lifestyle, the apartment complex has not one but two gyms (and one is an Equinox); a 75-foot rooftop lap pool with a hot tub, cold plunge and two sauna barrels because health and wellness really is everything nowadays and if celebs have a cold plunge so should you; a pet spa outfitted with Andy Warhol-designed black and white French Bulldog wallpaper because who doesn\u2019t love a Frenchie; and a Vons, instead of an Erewhon, Whole Foods or Trader Joe\u2019s.\nThat can all be yours for $3,995 a month, if it\u2019s a studio you want.\nLauren Schram contributed reporting.\n",

        "content": "A dispute over a Lincoln Park property has triggered accusations of wrongdoing between the co-CEO of Chicago\u2019s\nlargest residential brokerage\nand a pair of commercial real estate developers.\n@properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate\nco-CEO Thad Wong\nand\nNorth Park Ventures\nco-founders Robert Sekula and Eric Turrin each filed competing lawsuits accusing the other of breaching contracts over the property at 1628 North Wells Street. Both parties are asking that their joint LLC be dissolved and the building be sold, with the proceeds after paying off the debt being split equally between them, and asking the judge to order the other party to pay their attorneys\u2019 fees.\nBut they\u2019re at odds over the structure, price and broker to use for the deal.\nThe dispute came to a head after a plan to develop a seven-story, 48-unit building with retail fell apart and the owners attempted to sell the property.\nWong has accused Sekula and Turrin of entering into a listing agreement for the property, and rejecting an offer, without his approval. He also accuses them of listing the property for higher than market value to coax other investors to sell their shares to Sekula and Turrin.\nSekula and Turrin, in turn, have accused Wong of demanding that @properties be used to list the building, trying to use an associate to purchase the building and backing out after making an offer to buy them out of the property.\nSekula said he and Turrin are pushing back against many of Wong\u2019s claims; \u201cspecifically, we dispute that we breached the operating agreement for 1628 North Wells LLC or violated any duties owed to Mr. Wong,\u201d he wrote in an email to\nThe Real Deal.\nSekula and Turrin\u2019s attorney, Tim Herman, said they \u201cstand by the allegations made in our complaint.\u201d Wong\u2019s attorney, Aaron Stanton, denied the allegations made by Sekula and Turrin when speaking with\nTRD\n.\nWong, Sekula and Turrin formed an LLC in 2018 to purchase the property that currently includes retail and four residential units for $2.4 million. Wong owned 50 percent through his trust, and Sekula and Turin, along with other investors, owned 50 percent through 1628 North Wells NPV LLC.\nThe partnership\u2019s plan failed after the ward alderman, Brian Hopkins, denied their rezoning request. The income from the existing units is not covering the costs for operation and debt service on the $1.58 million mortgage on the building, and the property generated a net loss of $57,000 in 2024, according to the complaints.\nAs they considered selling the building last year, Turrin and Sekula retained two brokers to assess the property\u2019s value. The brokers gave valuations of $1.6 million and $1.8 million, according to both complaints.\nLast month, Turrin and Sekula worked with a broker at Interra Realty to gauge interest in the property, marketing it internally for $2.1 million. Sekula and Turrin said in their filing they did not enter into a fully executed listing agreement. But Wong\u2019s complaint claims they signed a listing agreement without his approval in breach of their contract.\nWong\u2019s attorney denied that Wong insisted on using his firm to market the property. He said he only requested that @properties be used as the broker. In an email he shared with\nTRD,\nStanton asked the partners\u2019 attorney, \u201cWould they agree to have @properties\u2019 commercial list?\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked if they would be amenable to that,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cThat\u2019s hardly demanding or insisting that they be the broker.\u201d\nWong alleges that Sekula and Turrin set the $2.1 million price, higher than the appraised value, because they didn\u2019t expect to receive offers and wanted to use that as leverage to convince another investor in their LLC to sell the investor\u2019s shares to them, based on a conversation Wong had with Sekula. Wong said they had no intention of selling the property at that price.\nSekula and Turrin\u2019s complaint, though, says they believe they can get more than that asking price, because they received such an offer before the building was publicly listed.\nWong\u2019s complaint said that he feared \u201cserious reputational damage\u201d from the alleged conduct over the listing price, arguing the LLC could face a lawsuit from a brokerage for breaching a listing agreement. It also says that he was not aware Sekula and Turrin had other investors in their stake of the property when he partnered with them.\nDuring the marketing process, Sekula and Turrin received an offer to buy the property for $2.1 million from Teo Scorte, a property manager for one of Wong\u2019s properties, according to Sekula and Turrin\u2019s complaint. They rejected the offer and suggested in the complaint that Scorte was acting as an intermediary for Wong, saying the offer was made \u201cunder the guise of being an independent purchaser.\u201d Stanton said Wong informed Scorte of the property being for sale but denied he was acting as an affiliate of Wong.\nIn September, Wong made an offer through his attorney to buy his partners out of the property and become its sole owner. In an email between their attorneys included in the complaint, Stanton wrote that Wong requested \u201cyour client sell the property for $2.1M or sell its 50 percent membership interest to Mr. Wong at half this price ($1.05M).\u201d\nAnother of Sekula and Turrin\u2019s attorneys, Chad Poznansky, replied saying they would accept the offer \u201cto sell NPV\u2019s 50 percent interest in 1628 North Wells LLC to the Wong Trust in exchange for $1,050,000.\u201d\nBut Stanton said that was a misunderstanding of Wong\u2019s offer. The property was weighed down with a $1.58 million mortgage, so each member\u2019s equity at a $2.1 million valuation would be $260,000. He said in a reply to Poznansky\u2019s email that the offer was meant to reflect that, and the amount Wong would pay for their interest would be about $300,000, not $1.05 million, while Wong would assume sole responsibility for the mortgage debt.\n\u201cThe allegation that Mr. Wong agreed to purchase his partner\u2019s interest for $1.05M is false,\u201d according to Stanton.\nSekula and Turrin said in their complaint that Wong breached the contract by backing out of the offer to pay $1.05 million for their 50 percent stake in the property, and they\u2019re asking the judge to order him to buy them out at that price.\nAlternatively, Wong\u2019s complaint says Sekula and Turrin asked for $640,000 for their stake in the property, which was the amount both parties have invested in the property so far. That would equate to a $2.86 million valuation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been seven years, and the property is losing money because the rents versus the costs don\u2019t match,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cSo we just want to move on.\u201d\n",

At the time, the tower had 320 apartments sitting on top of three floors of office space, which was then leased to WeWork.\nBut when the co-working company went bankrupt in 2023, the 980 Sixth Avenue location was among some 70 work centers it shuttered. Shortly after, Vanbarton decided to convert WeWork\u2019s three floors into more than 100 apartments.\nWith the conversion now complete, Vanbarton sought out new permanent financing with a five-year term. The new loan replaces a $273 million one from Blackstone\u2019s mortgage trust.\nRepresentatives for Vanbarton Group and Invesco could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nVanbarton is one of the most\nactive office-to-residential converters\nin the city, with a current pipeline exceeding 2,000 units.\nThe developer last month secured a\n$300 million loan\nfrom Brookfield to finance its acquisition and conversion of the former Emigrants Savings Bank building at 6 East 43rd Street. Vanbarton purchased the 400,000-square-foot building for $135 million earlier this year and plans to convert it into 441 rental apartments.\nColes and Tischler also recently purchased the home of the Archdiocese of New York at\n1011 First Avenue\n, which they plan to convert into 420 apartments. Last year, they bought 77 Water Street in the Financial District for\n$95 million\n, which will be transformed into 647 units.\nEarlier this month Vanbarton refinanced Pearl House, the 1970s-era FiDi office building it converted into 477 apartments, with $280 million in debt from AllianceBernstein and Brookfield.\n",

All Star Recruiting, which state records show is affiliated with All Star Healthcare Solutions, will move from its Deerfield Beach office at 800 Fairway Drive.\nAlso, tech firm EchoTwin AI, which provides AI spatial intelligence for cities to manage services and infrastructure, leased 2,700 square feet, marking its first office. Its founder Chris Carson is moving to South Florida from San Francisco.\nThe tenants that opted to stay at BRiC are health care tech firm Modernizing Medicine, which renewed its 127,800-square-foot lease; private school Everglades University renewed its 52,600-square-foot lease and publicly traded financial services firm NewtekOne renewed its 7,800-square-foot lease, according to the release.\nRyan Nunes and Alan Kleber of Cushman &amp; Wakefield represented All Star Recruiting, Cinch Home Services and Modernizing Medicine. JJL\u2019s Zach Wendelin and Adam Bernstein represented Everglades University. Bernstein has since joined Stream Realty. Jeff Kelly of CBRE represented the landlord, Boca Raton-based CP Group.\nCP Group, led by Angelo Bianco and Chris Eachus, and New York-based DRA Advisors, led by David Luski, own the 1.7 million-square-foot BRiC. In 2021, DRA paid\n$320.2 million\nfor a stake in the campus at 5000 T-Rex Avenue in\nBoca Raton\n.\nOriginally developed in the 1960s by IBM for its research and development, BRiC is undergoing a $100 million renovation that includes the addition of spec suites part of CP Group\u2019s worCPlaces flexible office portfolio, a Boca Raton Regional Hospital-managed wellness center, an autonomous grand-and-go store, two coffee shops, two gyms and indoor/outdoor event space, the release says.\nCP Group and DRA Advisors are expected to redevelop\nBRiC\ninto a mixed-use complex with multifamily, retail, dining, entertainment and a grocery store.

The in-migration fueled a market boom fueled by an office leasing frenzy and rent growth.\nRipco\u2019s business lines include landlord and tenant representation for retail leasing, investment sales across asset classes, and debt and equity advisory service. Last year, Ripco acquired Miami-based retail brokerage\nAcre\n, which has four brokers.\nSan Diego-based Cire Equity, led by Joshua Volen and Trevor Smith, owns the 12-story Gateway at Wynwood and adjacent one-story bank building at 2830 North Miami Avenue.

        "content": "Being close to Grand Central Terminal is a perk often proclaimed by pitching office landlords, but it\u2019s not a panacea for the ills facing Manhattan\u2019s market.\nClarion Partners and Alchemy Properties are in danger of foreclosure at 209-211 East 43rd Street, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The 24-story, 211,000-square-foot property is only a block from the major transit hub.\nLast week, a Miami-based plaintiff filed a lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court against a limited liability company with apparent links to a venture between the two owners, alleging default on a $57 million loan.\nIndividuals and the owners aren\u2019t specifically named by the lawsuit, but principals for both companies signed documents for a $65 million loan issued by Signature Bank in 2015. The loan was amended to $57 million in 2022, then ultimately passed along to the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff notified ownership of its default in April, claiming they owed $56.3 million, plus interest, according to the lawsuit.\n\nOwnership says it is is charting a path forward; a spokesperson told the outlet that it remains \u201ccommitted to achieving a positive and timely outcome for all parties involved through the successful recapitalization of the property.\u201d\nAlchemy and ABR Partners, in partnership with Clarion, acquired the leasehold on the Midtown East building in 2015 for\n$99 million\n, two years after Meadow Partners bought it for $61 million. Meadow spent $7 million on improvements and turned over much of the tenant roster during its brief ownership.\nTenants at the building include the missions of Bosnia, Mauritius and Costa Rica, Midtown Dental Services and physiatrist Douglas Schwartz. Japanese restaurant Izakaya Futago occupies the ground floor.\nAsking rent for office space in the building ranges from $35 to $144 per square foot, according to CoStar. There\u2019s roughly 30,000 square feet of space available across seven of the property\u2019s upper floors, according to Avison Young.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The City of Fort Lauderdale approved a major Live Local Act redevelopment of The Quay at 17th Street, a waterfront retail and office plaza.\nThe project is a joint venture with Coconut Grove-based The Related Group, led by Jorge, Jon Paul and Nicholas P\u00e9rez; Aventura-based\nBH Group\n, led by Liat and Isaac Toledano; and Boca Raton-based\nPebb Enterprises\n, led by Ian Weiner. The three firms that have partnered on other recent South Florida projects.\nThe development group won administrative approval for the project under the state law that allows qualifying affordable housing initiatives to bypass standard public hearings.\nThe partnership wants to redevelop the mixed-use complex and six-yacht marina on seven acres at 1515 17th Street into\nThe Quay\n, a 33-story project with 521 apartments along with 5,000 square feet of commercial space and more than 750 parking spaces. The developers plan to set aside 217 units for affordable and workforce housing, plans show.\n\nThe unit mix will range from studios to three-bedroom apartments. The developers also intend to demolish two low-rise office buildings to create a waterfront public plaza, while retaining the existing shopping center on the site.\nThe lot is currently zoned for 361 residential units and up to 12,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space, but under the Live Local Act, the city can approve the greater density without city commission approval since 40 percent of the homes will be affordable.\nLast year, the Related-BH-Pebb partnership paid\n$48.5 million\nfor The Quay property. The same group also owns\nOcean Walk\n, a retail plaza on Singer Island in Riviera Beach, and the former\nOffice Depot\nheadquarters campus in Boca Raton, where it plans a mixed-use project with 500 apartments, a large gym and several outparcels for retail and restaurants.\nThe Quay adds to Related\u2019s growing portfolio of Live Local developments across South Florida. Recently, the firm\u2019s affordable and workforce housing division submitted plans for a multifamily and hotel project at\nJackson Memorial Hospital\u2019s campus\nin Miami. Related is seeking to develop a 27-story tower with 460 apartments, a 31-story tower with 382 units and an 18-story, 128-key hotel. The development would also include 4,200 square feet of retail and 714 parking spaces in a pair of seven-story garages.",

        "content": "Just 35 paying tenants are left in the 130-unit South Shore building raided by federal agents in the middle of the night last month, a massive operation that stirred national controversy over immigration enforcement.\nAfter the raid disturbed the residents and left lingering uneasiness over the South Side neighborhood, a Cook County circuit court judge is now considering ordering them to move out due to its hazardous living conditions.\nPrior to the raid, the building had both paying tenants and squatters, though it\u2019s unclear how many. Federal agents, including from the ATF, the FBI and ICE, arrested 37 people on Sept. 30 for a variety of offenses, though information on the severity of the alleged crimes has been limited so far.\nLocal officials criticized the tactics that federal agents used in the raid, including allegedly temporarily detaining residents who were not later arrested.\nThe building, along with several others in a portfolio held by Wisconsin-based investor Trinity Flood, is the subject of a $27 million foreclosure lawsuit brought by Wells Fargo on behalf of CMBS bond holders.\nMore details about the aftermath of the raid were revealed in a Friday hearing regarding Wells Fargo\u2019s request to appoint a receiver to the building. Property manager Corey Oliver of Strength in Management said at the hearing that some tenants have moved out since the raid and about 35 have stayed put. He estimated that there are about 10 nonpaying squatters still occupying the property, as well.\nConditions at the 7500 South South Shore Drive building had been deteriorating for some time.\nThe foreclosure was filed earlier this year after Flood, the landlord, failed to make debt payments on the South Shore building as well as several others in Chicago and across the U.S.\n\nAt last week\u2019s hearing, Cook County Circuit Court Judge Debra Seaton heard from city inspectors, the ward\u2019s alderman and Oliver, who all relayed varying descriptions of the current state of the building. City inspectors tasked with evaluating electrical systems at the building were particularly alarmed by faulty wiring leading out to the city\u2019s utility poles, noting that lines hang low enough to hit the top of a garbage truck.\nThey also pointed to fire hazards caused by extension cords and hijacked meters in the building, likely used to provide power to squatters\u2019 units. Only one of the building\u2019s elevators is operating. A plumbing inspector noted that the boiler room had a strong odor that could be attributed to a gas leak and stated that raw sewage and sewer gases were leaking into the building at various points.\nBut Oliver said that since the raid Flood had already invested $100,000 into repairs to the building, including plumbing and electrical repairs. He also said he was told he needed to re-submit a permit for some of the electrical work that needed to be done at the property. Another new addition is three armed security guards that now patrol the building from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. every night.\nFlood\u2019s attorney attended the hearing on her behalf which was a choice Seaton criticised.\nSeaton said she will not appoint a receiver until she can evaluate the progress of the work currently ongoing at the property. If the immediate dangers are not resolved quickly, though, she said she will not only consider appointing a receiver but will also weigh issuing a court order for all the remaining tenants to relocate.\nThe order would also likely require some form of relocation assistance be provided to the tenants.\nDuring the hearing, 7th Ward Alderman Greg Mitchell, who represents the area, said he is skeptical that things will turn around in the next few weeks. \u201cMy current concern is that I don\u2019t feel the building is safe,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThe building has been broken into several times and it is a target now.\u201d\nJonah Karsh with the Metropolitan Tenants Organization said that prior to the raid, tenants he heard from did not want to stay in the building. \u201cWe had dozens of tenants requesting relocation,\u201d he said.\nSeaton said she wanted to hear from the current tenants herself before deciding if an order was necessary. She asked that current tenants attend a hearing regarding the receivership next month. She ordered another inspection for Nov. 6 and a hearing for Nov. 7.",

The properties spent 132 days on the market, on average.\nForty-four luxury listings were added to the market, for a total of 1,177 listings.\nThe\nprevious week\n, buyers signed contracts for 16 properties in Miami-Dade, asking a combined $124.3 million.\nThe asking dollar volume for the ten single-family homes and six condos under contract last week totals $159.1 million, according to the report published by the Douglas Elliman team led by Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes.\nThe single-family homes that entered into contract last week have an average asking price of $10.2 million and spent an average of 127 days on the market. They total $101.9 million in asking dollar volume.\n\nThe priciest single-family home to secure a buyer is the waterfront home at 6380 North Bay Road in Miami Beach. Richard Lane, chairman emeritus of the New York-based\nOlnick Organization\n, and his wife, Barbara Lane, own the 4,500-square-foot, four-bedroom and four-and-a-half-bathroom house at 6380 North Bay Road.

The house was built in 1951 on a 0.6-acre lot.\nThe second most-expensive house to go under contract last week is the waterfront 9,200-square-foot mansion at 16 Palm Avenue. A trust in the name of Tom Sullivan, founder and CEO of Lawrenceburg, Tennessee-based Lumber Liquidators, owns the 0.8-acre property on Palm Island in Miami Beach. It\u2019s on the market with Venetian International\u2019s Luis Bosch, asking $24.9 million. The six-bedroom, six-and-a-half-bathroom home was built in 1930. It previously sold for $11.5 million in 2008.\nThe condos that secured buyers last week have an average asking price of $9.6 million and spent 141 days on the market, on average. They total $57.5 million in asking dollar volume, or an average of $2,3723 per square foot.\nA double-condo at the Continuum South Beach owned by the late Broadway producer Luigi Caiola and his husband, Sean McGill, found a buyer. Bill Hernandez and Bryan Sereny of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Bill and Bryan Team are listing unit 2608/2609 at 100 South Pointe Drive in Miami Beach for $19.4 million. The 3,700-square-foot unit, with four bedrooms and five and a half bathrooms, also comes with a guest suite and two assigned parking spaces.\nLast week in New York, buyers signed contracts for 30 homes, according to the latest\nOlshan\nreport. Their combined asking price is $246 million, and the typical home spent 688 days on the market.\n",

The floating-rate, interest-only loan refinances existing debt on the 1.1 million-square-foot office tower at 60 Columbus Circle and covers roughly two-thirds of its $1.65 billion appraised value, Bisnow\nreported\n.\nIt will carry a two-year term with three one-year extension options and will be co-originated by German American Capital Corp. and Wells Fargo, which will serve as mortgage loan sellers.\nDeutsche Bank, which relocated its U.S. headquarters to the tower from Wall Street in 2021, occupies 93.5 percent of the building under a 20-year lease with an option to renew for another two decades. The property is fully leased, according to Fitch, reflecting resilience in a midtown market still navigating post-pandemic shifts in office demand.\nThe building \u2014\nformerly\nthe Time Warner Center before the media giant decamped to Hudson Yards \u2014 sits within the 2.8 million-square-foot Deutsche Bank Center complex overlooking Columbus Circle. Related retains a roughly 3 percent stake in the office tower, while Singapore\u2019s GIC and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority each hold 48.1 percent.\n\nRepresentatives for the owners didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe refinancing marks a turnaround from a larger $1.5 billion single-asset CMBS deal the same ownership group shelved in 2022 amid bond-market volatility. With financing conditions still tight and benchmark rates high, the successful closing of this smaller, shorter-term loan would signal improving lender confidence in trophy New York assets with stable tenancy.\nThe loan is slated to close Oct. 29.\nDeutsche Bank Center remains one of Manhattan\u2019s premier mixed-use properties, with its office component joined by luxury retail and the Mandarin Oriental hotel.\n",

The sprawling limestone mansion topped off a total of 30 homes in the borough asking $4 million or more to enter contract, up from 25 in the\nprevious period\n.\nCosby listed the 13,000-square-foot abode in September in an\nattempt to offload it\nbefore his lender, First Foundation Bank, foreclosed on the property. The bank initiated proceedings roughly nine months ago, claiming Cosby had defaulted on a $17.5 million loan and owed more than $300,000 in property taxes.\nThe disgraced former sitcom star and his wife, Camille, bought the six-story townhouse in 1987 for $6.3 million. The home, known as the Luyster Mansion and built in 1899, has six bedrooms and nine bathrooms. It also features an elevator and 500-square-foot rooftop terrace.\nCorcoran\u2019s Adam Schneider had the listing.\nThe second most expensive property to nab a signed contract was a penthouse at 895 Park Avenue, with an asking price of $21.5 million. The triplex apartment on the 16th, 17th and 18th floors hit the market in March asking just under $30 million.\n\nThe co-op spans 6,900 square feet and has four bedrooms and six bathrooms. It also features a library, staff rooms, three fireplaces and multiple terraces. It last traded for $15 million in 2009 and underwent a two-year renovation the following year.\nBrown Harris Stevens\u2019 John Burger had the listing.\nThe Park Avenue co-op is also home to a\nfamed penthouse\nthat once belonged to composer Leonard Bernstein, who in 1970, along with his wife Felicia, hosted an event for the Black Panther Party which Tom Wolfe wrote about for New York Magazine.\nOf the 30 properties, 19 were condos, seven were co-ops and four were townhouses.\nThe homes\u2019 combined asking price was $246 million, for an average price of $8.2 million and a median of $6.1 million.

The concept calls for an \u201copen-air destination\u201d that could accommodate events too large for the\nSalt Shed\u2019s\n5,500-person outdoor limit.\nGolden, who co-founded Sterling Bay before launching\nBlue Star\nin 2008, estimates the expansion would cost between $60 million and $70 million including land acquisition, infrastructure and construction.\nThe property is being sold by a Labkon family venture that once operated the General Iron scrap metal plant nearby. Colliers\u2019 Mike Senner is marketing the site.\n\nSignificant challenges remain. The riverfront parcel needs major upgrades \u2014 new seawalls, water and sewer lines \u2014 that could add to the bill. Golden hasn\u2019t ruled out seeking public subsidies such as tax-increment financing but said the project\u2019s feasibility is still being evaluated.\nIf built, the venue could host 30 to 40 shows each summer and offer space for neighborhood street fests or a winter skating rink. The expansion would also cement the North Branch Industrial Corridor\u2019s shift from factories to festivals, part of a broader post-industrial makeover that began after the city eased zoning restrictions along the river in 2017.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a natural addition to what we do,\u201d Golden said.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "An office-to-housing redevelopment in San Mateo is among the developments helping to reach state-mandated housing goals in cities across the Bay Area.\nO\u2019Farrell Development and DNA Design and Architecture proposed the 87-unit apartment project, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nThe site at 1919 O\u2019Farrell Street spans less than an acre and has a low-rise office building and surface parking. The development is slated to rise seven stories and include one- and two-bedroom units and a rooftop deck.\nIn San Mateo, diminished office demand and heightened need for housing make projects like these increasingly meaningful in meeting housing element requirements. Approximately 20 percent of office space in San Mateo is considered functionally obsolete, meaning more demolitions could come in the future.\nSan Mateo is on the hook for 7,015 new homes by 2031 under its\nhousing element\n.\nOffice-to-residential redevelopments are becoming common across the Peninsula.\nPresidio Bay Ventures\nacquired\nthe former U.S. Geological Survey campus in Menlo Park earlier this year for $137 million. That property includes 17 office, research and laboratory buildings spanning 412,700 square feet on 17.4 acres.\n\nHarvest Properties bought\nthe 22-acre, 379,600-square-foot Clearview Business Park in San Mateo for $102 million last month. The offices at those sites are expected to be redeveloped into housing, in the largest office redevelopment in the Peninsula proposed this year.\nMeanwhile, apartment construction has fallen off dramatically, with apartment starts in the Bay Area dropping from more than 3,000 in a typical quarter to only a few hundred.\nAcross the country, 542,800 units were under construction at the end of the second quarter, marking the\nlowest level in a decade\n, according to RealPage data cited by the Business Times.\nHigh borrowing costs and pricey labor and materials are forcing developers to slam the brakes for projects already entitled or proposed.\nThere are a few Peninsula cities, however, that could provide multifamily developers some hope. In Daly City, developers started construction on the enclave\u2019s first market-rate apartment project in 15 years, which will\nreplace a former Burlington Coat Factory\nat Westlake Shopping Center with a 214-unit residential complex.\nSouth San Francisco, meanwhile, is seeing an increase in construction activity as compact, mixed-use areas become more attractive to developers and residents.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Rasken\u2019s Colette is a five-story, 38-unit luxury condo slated for 1880 Brickell Avenue, with prices starting at $3.3 million, according to a press release. He\u2019s tapped Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund-Gomes Team to lead sales and marketing for the project.\n\u201cBoutique is what everyone wants now,\u201d said Fredrik Eklund, who heads the team along with John Gomes. \u201cThese huge glass towers can take many, many, many years to build and sometimes to sell out. There\u2019s a little more risk as a buyer.\u201d\n\nFloor plans in Colette will span between two- and four-bedrooms. The building will also have two penthouses. Colette\u2019s amenities will include a rooftop pool, wellness facilities, a screening room, children\u2019s playroom, and a meeting room. The design team includes Brazilian architecture group OSPA.\n\u201cWe believe that the next chapter in South Florida is not just height and glass,\u201d Rasken said.\nHe anticipates the buyer demographic for this project will include locals, particularly younger buyers who have been renting in Brickell and are considering a move to Coconut Grove. Rasken and Eklund also expect buyers from the Northeast. They foresee Colette\u2019s buyers making the building their primary home.\nRasken went into contract for the 0.8 acre Colette site for\n$10.7 million\nlast year. His other projects include Opus, a 14-unit boutique condominium project in Coconut Grove. He landed a\n$28 million construction loan\nfor the building from Arixa Capital in August.",

The listing breaks down to $1,643 per square foot of interior space.\nThe eight-bedroom apartment spans the entire 51st and 52nd floors of Museum Tower. The interiors account for 14,000 square feet, while there are another 2,000 square feet worth of private terraces. Features of the apartment include a wood-burning fireplace, multiple kitchens, a double-height foyer with a spiral staircase and a private gym in the primary suite. Views are of Central Park and both the Hudson and the East Rivers.\nIcahn first listed the apartment in 2019 for $35 million, before the pandemic wrought havoc on the market. After slashing the ask by $5 million, he took the property off the market in 2021.\nIt was a similarly long quest to put the unit together in the first place. Icahn purchased the first component of the property for less than $3.5 million in 1986. He tacked on another $3.2 million purchase in 1994, then completed the collection with\na $9 million buy\nin 2018, a year before he listed the property.\n\nIcahn has since moved to\nIndian Creek Village\nin Miami.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Patricia Vance has the listing and said the unit is \u201cpriced to sell.\u201d Ichan has stuck to the advice of his real estate agents on how to price the property, he said.\nMuseum Tower was built in 1983 and designed by C\u00e9sar Pelli. The property sits on top of the Museum of Modern Art and has 250 residences.

Lender\nACORE Financial\u2019s recent $187 million foreclosure lawsuit\nagainst longtime Chicago hotelier Su-Mei Yen for a separate South Loop hotel complex and the\nsame lender\u2019s seizure of a River North hotel\nhave jolted the city\u2019s hospitality industry.\nThe loan was for the Hiltons at McCormick Place at 123 East Cermak Road, the 466-key tri-branded property connected to the city\u2019s convention center, Walker &amp; Dunlop said in a release.\nMcHugh and First Investors developed the 23-story hotel tower in 2018 with a $78 million mortgage from Wells Fargo,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported, when the property was hailed as the country\u2019s first triple-branded Hilton.\n\nThey refinanced in 2019 with the $112 million mortgage from CrossHarbor, meaning they could have pocketed some of the difference with a cash-out deal.\nThe deal with Access Point underscores how refinancing math has shifted for even strong-performing hospitality assets. What once penciled out at nine figures now looks more modest, as rising interest costs and lender caution reshape the post-pandemic playbook for hotel owners.\nPatty McHugh, chair of McHugh Enterprises, stated that the property \u201ccontinues to thrive,\u201d crediting Walker &amp; Dunlop for navigating the process amid volatile capital markets. The company\u2019s construction arm also built the hotel, which combines Hilton Garden Inn, Hampton Inn and Home2 Suites brands under one roof.\nA McHugh spokesperson didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment regarding how the debt gap was closed from the CrossHarbor deal.\nThe fresh capital gives the ownership group breathing room in a higher-rate market that\u2019s throttled hospitality deals citywide.\nEven as Chicago\u2019s convention business rebounds, hotel trades have been scarce, and refinancing packages increasingly reflect smaller principal balances as values lag behind pre-pandemic highs.\nWalker &amp; Dunlop\u2019s Aaron Appel and Dustin Stolly led the capital markets team for the Hiltons at McCormick deal, while the firm\u2019s Jay Morrow and Carter Gradwell advised the borrowers.

        "content": "Former Illinois House Speaker Lee Daniels is looking to cash out of his Lake Michigan getaway.\nThe retired DuPage County lawmaker and his wife, Pamela, listed their five-bedroom\nNew Buffalo\nhome for just under $7 million \u2014 roughly $250,000 more than its previous ask this summer, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe property, at 11869 Marquette Drive, spans nearly 5,000 square feet and sits on the lakefront about 71 miles east of Chicago. The asking price equates to $1,400 per square foot.\nBuilt in 2015, the home blends\nPrairie School\ninfluences with a contemporary twist \u2014 a stone-and-stucco exterior gives way to airy interiors with glass-front kitchen cabinets, a minimalist fireplace wall and sweeping lake views framed by floor-to-ceiling windows.\nOutdoor amenities include a cabana tucked midway down the dune and a path leading to the beach.\nLiz Roch of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate has the listing. The Daniels\u2019 could not be reached for comment, and Roch did not respond to inquiries from Crain\u2019s. Berrien County property records show the couple has owned the site since at least 2015 through a trust in Lee Daniels\u2019 name.\n\nThe price bump reflects a tightening\nhigh-end market\nin the Lake Michigan resort town, where multimillion-dollar listings have been moving fast.\nA home about half a mile away on Marquette Drive went under contract within three days after hitting the market earlier this month for just under $7 million. Another property along the Galien River listed for nearly $5 million in September also found a buyer in less than two weeks.\nThough the Daniels\u2019 $6.99 million ask is near the top of the local market, it\u2019s still below New Buffalo\u2019s record sale \u2014 an $8.52 million transaction in 2023 for the house next door.\nDaniels, 82, was a fixture in Illinois Republican politics for more than three decades. He represented\nDuPage County\ndistricts in the state House from 1975 to 2007, serving as Minority Leader for most of that period and as Speaker from 1995 to 1997.

        "content": "When Florida lawmakers first approved the Live Local Act in 2023 in an effort to alleviate the affordable housing crisis, developers rushed to seize on its incentives and filed a slew of project applications.\nSince then, they\u2019ve completed nearly 3,200 below-market rental units in 23 projects across the state, according to a Florida TaxWatch, a nonpartisan and nonprofit research institute.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just how long real estate takes,\u201d said attorney Anthony De Yurre, referring to the drawn out project approval and construction process.\nThe law incentivizes developers by allowing them to build bigger projects \u2013 up to the highest density permitted in a jurisdiction and the tallest height permitted within a mile \u2013 as long as they designate at least 40 percent of their apartments for households earning up to 120 percent of the area median income. The apartments have to remain at below-market rents for at least 30 years.\nLive Local\u2019s other perks are that developers can bypass public hearings and only go through administrative approvals and tiered property tax exemptions: a 75 percent exemption for apartments for households earning between 80 percent and 120 percent of the AMI, and a 100 percent exemption for apartments for earners of less than 80 percent of the AMI.\nThe law was tweaked in the past two years, including to loosen floor area ratio and parking requirements. Those who jumped on projects right after the legislation was first passed have been working through site plan approval and construction drawing permitting, De Yurre said.\n\u201cI can tell you from my projects, now is when we are heavily engaged in discussions with lenders for early adopters of the law,\u201d De Yurre said.\nBut developers still are betting big on Live Local. A total of 143 projects with 43,400 units, combined, are in various stages from proposed to approved under the state law, research from the nonprofit Florida Housing Coalition shows.\nNearly half of the planned units are in Miami-Dade County, while 11.2 percent are in Broward County and 6.3 percent are in Palm Beach County, the Florida Housing Coalition data shows.\nQuestions still loom over Live Local. For one, lenders are only now getting introduced to Live Local projects and analyzing their financials. And although developers continue to rush to file project proposals, questions remain whether Live Local will help alleviate the affordable housing crisis.\nAcross Florida, there were 25 affordable apartments available and attainable for every 100 extremely low income households, or those earning up to 30 percent of the AMI, last year, according to the Florida TaxWatch report.\nAI woes\n\nAs South Florida developers feel the sting from higher construction costs and insurance premiums, as well as elevated interest rates, confusion and widespread misinformation about the law also is delaying projects.\nUnder Live Local, Florida counties that have a sufficient supply of below-market rentals that exceeds the demand from earners of less than 120 percent of the AMI can opt out of the property tax exemption. None of South Florida\u2019s three counties, where the affordable housing crisis is most heightened, qualify for this, the Florida TaxWatch report shows.\n\u201cChatGPT and AI has a very bizarre way of rearing its head in the legal world and usually creates a lot of misinformation,\u201d said De Yurre, a Miami-based land use and zoning attorney who helped draft the act and represents developers pursuing Live Local projects.\u00a0 \u201cIt is creating a lot of misinformation with lenders in regards to the statute and property tax exemption.\u201d\nGenerally, private equity is \u201calways going to be more entrepreneurial\u201d and open to Live Local compared with banks, which usually prefer to lend on programs once they become widespread, De Yurre said.\nSouth Florida\u2019s most advanced Live Local projects include Cymbal DLT Companies\u2019 completed\n341-unit Laguna Gardens\ncomplex in Miami Gardens. Completed last year, it was originally planned as market-rate rentals and Cymbal DLT retroactively converted it to Live Local, allowing the firm to use the law\u2019s tax breaks.\nAlso, near North Miami, developer Daniel Abreu scored\n$16.5 million\nlast year to build an 80-unit building, marking one of the first known construction loans for a Live Local project.\n\u201cMissing middle\u201d v. extremely low income\nThe need for below-market rentals in South Florida is high.\nIn Miami-Dade and Monroe counties, there\u2019s a deficit of 143,805 units for households earning less than 80 percent of the AMI, according to the Florida TaxWatch report, which cited a 2024 University of Florida study for the data. The deficit is 85,345 units in Broward County, and 37,699 units in Palm Beach County.\nMany Live Local developers are marketing their South Florida projects\u2019 below-market rate apartments for households earning up to 120 percent of the AMI, but few are dropping rents for the extremely low-income who earn 30 percent of the AMI.\nBut De Yurre argues it\u2019s earners of 80 percent to 120 percent of the AMI, the so-called \u201cmissing middle,\u201d whom Live Local is intended to help. Projects with lower rents generally would have to be subsidized by low-income housing tax credits and other public financing programs.\n\u201cPeople say this [Live Local] isn\u2019t truly affordable. But if you do less than 80 percent [of the AMI], the teacher can\u2019t qualify,\u201d he said, arguing that the workforce such as educators, firefighters and police make too much to qualify for a unit targeting earners below 80 percent of the AMI. \u201cThis is the only program that helps out in that regard. This is the only program that helps out in that regard.\u201d",

The home, which is currently listed for $23.8 million, or $2,633 per square foot, fell into contract last week to become the top pending deal for the period, based on its asking price. That\u2019s according to Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team\u2019s\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n, which is compiled by Marcy Roth.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019\nDrew Fenton\nand Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\u2019s\nAaron Kirman\nhold the listing.\nAnthony purchased the property in 2010 for $3.5 million, when it still had the original house built in the 1940s. That was ultimately torn down for a new build in 2018,\u00a0 a project that was completed in 2022, according to a\nWall Street Journal\ninterview with Anthony and his wife, Betim Anthony, at the time of the property\u2019s listing.\nThe new home, which sits on over half an acre, has seven bedrooms and 10 baths across over 9,000 square feet. Dubbed the \u201cBentley House,\u201d the home is shrouded in privacy behind gates and hedges. Inside, there\u2019s a screening room, wine cellar, office and gym.\nLast year is when the couple decided to hang up the for-sale sign, listing the home for nearly $27 million, or $2,986 per square foot.\nSitting in the No. 2 spot among last week\u2019s signed contracts within Los Angeles County is 14952 Alva Drive in Pacific Palisades.\nThe property is listed for $13.9 million, or $2,037 per square foot, and is located in the Palisades\u2019 Huntington neighborhood.\n\nThe six-bed, nine-bath home spans 6,800 square feet. The gated property sits on about a third of an acre, with highlights that include a media room, pool house, pool, cold plunge, outdoor shower and spa.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019 Nichole Shanfeld has the listing.\nThe seller is a trust tied to Jeffrey Mark Hancock and Susan Gregg Renfrew, according to property records.\nOverall, the number of contracts signed in L.A. County last week was flat at 16 compared to a year ago, according to the\nEklund Gomes report\n. Meanwhile, last week\u2019s asking volume fell about 7 percent from a year earlier to $129.1 million.\nRoth called out the activity as another example of Los Angeles\u2019 \u201croller coaster\u201d real estate market, after three straight weeks notching year-over-year increases in volume.\n\u201cWe suspect this is a blip in the market as, anecdotally, we are starting to see properties that have previously sat, go under contract,\u201d she said.\nRoth tempered the point, however, adding that \u201cit is possible the holiday slowdown has begun.\u201d\n",

The community will also feature two lakes, a pair of amenity centers, a 50-acre city park and a 55-acre business park.\nOn the civic side, about 206 acres will be reserved for two elementary schools, a middle school and a high school within the Denton ISD. Another 156 acres are earmarked for commercial use.\n\nThe site is just south of Hillwood\u2019s 3,200-acre\nLandmark\nproject.\nDenton Range, managed by Silvestri Investments, is an investor in the project. Johnson Development is already active in North Texas with its\nViridian\ncommunity in Arlington and\nTrinity Falls\nin McKinney.\nPlans for Cole Ranch stretch back to the mid-2010s, when the city first held public hearings on the massive residential proposal.\nThe Texas Legislature approved a municipal management district for the site in 2019. Earlier this year, Denton City Council tweaked the zoning for more than 300 acres from light industrial land in favor of residential and mixed-use development, signaling the city\u2019s shift toward a more community-oriented buildout.\nThe property has deep local roots. The Cole family has owned the land since the 1930s, when Miner Thomas \u201cM.T.\u201d Cole ran it as a working ranch.

        "content": "Los Angeles is firmly in the trend of homebuyers walking away from deals at record levels as costs, inspection woes and financing hurdles chip away at the market.\nAcross the country, about 56,000 home-purchase agreements, or 15.1 percent of all contracts signed, were canceled in August, the highest share for that month since Redfin began tracking the data in 2017, L.A. Business First\nreported\n, citing Redfin data. The rate was up from 14.3 percent a year earlier.\nIn Los Angeles, 14.9 percent of sales fell in August this year, down a small tick from 15 percent in August of last year, a\ncontinuation of a trend\nthat goes back to spring.\nThe Los Angeles area isn\u2019t the only market in California seeing home sales collapse. Cancellations in San Jose climbed to 6.9 percent year-over-year from 1.6 percent, marking the largest year-over-year increase in all metro areas tracked by Redfin. In San Francisco, the\ncancellation rate\nrose to 5.9 percent, a 2.3 percent year-over-year increase from 3.6 percent. Notably,\nrents in San Francisco\nhave now\nsurpassed pre-pandemic levels\n.\nThe market is soft on prices, too. Nationally, one in six sellers, or about 16.7 percent, dropped their asking price in August, the steepest share since 2012. Homes sold for an average of 3.8 percent below asking price across the country. As is the case nationwide, the housing market in Los Angeles has been plagued by affordability issues, increasing insurance premiums and overall economic uncertainty.\n\nWith an oversupply of about half a million more sellers than buyers last month, buyers have been using the upper hand to negotiate for repairs and discounts. One agent in Tampa, for example, told Business First they worked with a seller who received 78 repair requests in a failed deal after multiple price cuts.\nInspection or repair issues drove more than 70 percent of broken contracts, though failed financing, slow sales of buyers\u2019 own homes, and shaky economic confidence also played key roles. About 62 percent of agents similarly reported more deals falling apart than a year ago, per Homelight data cited by Business First.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Film director\nTanya Wexler\nparted with a townhouse at\n83 Jane Street\nfor $14.6 million. The buyer was an LLC named after the property\u2019s address. Wexler, who purchased the residence in 1999, put the five-story property on the market in May 2024 for $17.5 million. The townhouse has an elevator, roof deck, 2,000 square feet of outdoor space and five bedrooms. Compass\u2019\nStephen Ferrara\nand\nClayton Orrigo\nhad the listing.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nAn LLC tied to\nAcadia Realty Trust\noffloaded a retail and office condo at\n1035 Third Avenue\n, between 61st and 62nd Streets in Lenox Hill, for $22 million. The buyer was an LLC linked to\nAlbert Rabizadeh\nof\nGlobal Asset Management LLC.\nThe 30-story-tall building is mixed-use, with 113 apartments in addition to commercial space. In 2015, Acada paid $29 million for the two units and another $22 million for a parking garage there. The first-floor retail unit measures about 7,800 square feet, and the office space covers about 12,800 square feet across floors one and two.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Stephen Orlins\n, president of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, and\nJiaying Jiang\ndropped $7.9 million on a sponsor unit at\n15 Hudson Yards\n, which was developed by\nRelated Companies and Oxford Properties Group\n. The unit, when it first hit the market almost a decade ago, had an initial asking price of $11.9 million, but its most recent asking price was just under $8.5 million. The four-bedroom pad spans just over 3,000 square feet, pricing the deal at about $2,600 per square foot. Corcoran\u2019s\nHottinger Team\nand\nArsic Lau Team\nhad the listing.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nIn the West Village, about a block from the Whitney Museum of American Art, a townhouse at\n80 Horatio Street\n, which at one point appeared to be an apartment building, changed hands for $10.3 million. The seller was\n80 Horatio St. Corp\n., whose president and CEO is\nPatrick Monahan\n; the company had owned the property since at least the late 1970s. The buyer was an LLC tied to\nMaurice Regan,\nfounder and CEO of construction firm J.T. Magen &amp; Company. Brown Harris Stevens\u2019\nAmy Herman\nand\nKyle Cooper\nhad the listing.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nAlso in the West Village, journalist\nDavid Muir\nshed his townhouse at\n256 West 4th Street\nfor $6.9 million. The buyer was\n256 W 4th LLC.\nMuir purchased the home via an LLC in 2013 for $4.2 million. The four-story residence dates to 1877 and has three bedrooms and three bathrooms. The property went on the market in April for $7.5 million. Compass\u2019\nHenry Hershkowitz, Britt Blaxton, Christine Rocchio, Anthony Lucia\nand\nJonathan Meiselman\nhad the listing.\n\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nAn LLC linked to\nJeremy Lo Yi Yun\nscooped up a sponsor unit at The Centrale at\n138 East 50th Street\nin Turtle Bay for $6.4 million.

        "content": "The ad warns: \u201cYour neighborhood essentials are at stake.\u201d\nThe mailer, paid for by the City Council, states that three of the questions that will appear on the November ballot will take away communities\u2019 power to \u201cdemand the city and developers invest\u201d in neighborhoods \u201cwhen allowed to build.\u201d\nCity Council leadership has painted most of the housing ballot questions as a power grab by the administration, arguing that the measures threaten to deprive City Council members the leverage they need during zoning negotiations to guarantee deeper affordability, as well as investments in their communities.\nThe City Council has declined to reveal how much it has spent or plans to spend on its campaign against the measures. The Council\u2019s budget for postage and printing supplies was increased by roughly $2.3 million earlier this year, though that was before the mayor\u2019s Charter Revision Commission even released its preliminary\nreport\noutlining potential changes to the city\u2019s land use review process.\nMeanwhile, a coalition supporting the measures, Yes on Affordable Housing, has committed to spending $3 million to promote the housing proposals.\nThe questions at issue, if approved, would:\n\u2014\nCreate two different \u201cfast track\u201d options for affordable housing projects.\nHousing Development Fund Companies building publicly-funded, 100 percent affordable housing could receive approvals for zoning changes through the city\u2019s Board of Standards and Appeals rather than going through the full Uniform Land Use Review Procedure.\nThe other track would apply to affordable housing projects proposed in the 12 community districts that have approved the least amount of affordable housing. Starting in October 2026, the city would release a report identifying what districts have permitted the least amount of affordable housing in the previous five years. Such projects will go through a condensed Ulurp: Community Boards will have the same amount of time to review these proposals (60 days), but the applicable borough president will review the proposal at the same time, rather than for 30 days after the community board\u2019s review. The City Planning Commission, which will then have 30 days to review instead of 60, will have the final vote on these proposals, rather than the City Council.\n\u2014\nCreate a new land use review process for \u201cmodest\u201d housing and infrastructure projects.\nThis new review process, dubbed Expedited Land Use Review Procedure or Elurp, would apply to housing projects in medium- or high-density districts that increase residential capacity by no more than 30 percent or to housing projects in low-density districts that are no taller than 45 feet and have a maximum floor area ratio of two. Proposals to put solar panels on public buildings or other land would also qualify. The City Council could also approve additional project categories, though I wouldn\u2019t bank on that.\nElurp would follow the same timeline outlined in the previous question, but depending on the project type, either the City Planning Commission or the City Council\u2019s review is skipped. (Some projects require review by the City Council under state law.)\n\u2014\nReplace the mayoral veto with an appeals board\n. As it stands, Ulurp ends with the mayor, who usually goes along with whatever action the City Council takes (with a\nfew exceptions\n). This proposal would replace the mayor\u2019s power to veto land use decisions with a three-person appeals board, consisting of the mayor, City Council speaker and the applicable borough president. The appeals board could reverse City Council\u2019s rejection of projects that would create affordable housing. Such projects can only affect one borough. The appeals board can also restore such project proposals to the version approved by the City Planning Commission, undoing modifications approved by the City Council.\nAs City Council leaders wage a public campaign against the ballot measures, which has drawn\nallegations of electioneering\nthat the Council have denied, Conservatives in the Council are trying to challenge the measures in court. Last week, a state Supreme Court judge\nthrew out\na lawsuit brought by the Council\u2019s Common Sense Caucus seeking to annul the ballot measures. The group, along with other plaintiffs, have appealed the decision.\n\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: If the ballot measures are not approved, what will this mean for the next administration\u2019s housing goals? What steps would the next mayor need to take, absent these changes? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The late Diane Keaton was an avid house flipper, having rented, bought, renovated or designed nearly 50 homes,\naccording to the New York Times\n.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 City Council member Keith Powers plans to run for Assembly member Harvey Epstein\u2019s seat,\nCity &amp; State reports\n. Epstein, who represents the East Side of Manhattan, is expected to be elected to the City Council, taking over Carlina Rivera\u2019s former seat.\n\u2014 Gov. Kathy Hochul is considering whether to sign or veto a measure that would permit physician-assisted death for patients with an incurable diagnosis and less than six months to live,\nGothamist reports\n. If she signs the bill, New York would become the 12th state to authorize physician-assisted death.\n\u2014 Billionaire John Catsimatidis thinks Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa should drop out of the mayoral race,\nthe New York Post reports\n. \u201cCurtis would make the best mayor of all the candidates \u2026 but Curtis has to realize that he should love New York more than anything else,\u201d Catsimatidis said on WABC radio Monday. \u201cIt certainly looks like Curtis should pull out right now.\u201d\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$14.6 million\nfor 83 Jane Street. The West Village townhouse is 6,000 square feet.\nCompass\u2019\nThe Hudson Advisory Team has the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$22 million\nfor a commercial condo unit at 1035 Third Avenue. The Upper East Side building has over 245,000 square feet of floor area and is a mixed-use building.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $14.2 million for a penthouse unit at 240 Park Avenue South. The Flatiron condo is 3,900 square feet.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s\nMichael Graves has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 65,392-square-foot, nine-story, mixed-use building at 2054 Walton Avenue in the Bronx. Nikolai Katz is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

The hotel would have 147 rooms and still feature a restaurant, coffee shop, fitness center and parking for 106 vehicles. The building would take the form of a low-rise structure with a central courtyard. It\u2019s expected to take a year and a half to complete.\nSandstone purchased the development site in 2014 for $4.6 million. News of the company\u2019s plans to build a hotel first surfaced in 2019.\n\nOther mixed-use developments are in the works in Culver City.\nThis summer, Dallas-based Lincoln Property Company\ntweaked its plans\nfor nearly 67,000 square feet of offices at 11111 Jefferson Boulevard, opting to build more housing rather than offices as office vacancy in the third quarter ticked up to 23.9 percent,\nper\nCushman &amp; Wakefield.\nElsewhere in Culver City, Los Angeles-based Hudson Pacific Properties is\nlooking to redevelop\na 169,000-square-foot office campus formerly occupied by the NFL\u2019s media offshoot into a mixed-use development with housing and commercial uses. Hudson Pacific\u2019s plans would turn the 6-acre property at 10950 Washington Boulevard into two five-story buildings turned into 508 apartments and\u00a0 14,000 square feet of ground-floor commercial space.\nIrvine-based Greens previously added a hotel near Los Angeles International Airport to its portfolio,\nsnapping up the Wingate by Wyndham property\nnear the airport in 2023 for $23.7 million. The 148-key property at 10300 La Cienaga Boulevard was bought in 1999 for $5.3 million by George and Linda Oh, with trustee Sandra Oh selling the lodging.

Cantor had owned the property since 2019, when the firm bought it for $77 million with a $50 million loan from Berkeley Point Capital.\nTogether, the deals keep the swift momentum of Chicago region\u2019s multifamily market rolling as recent new development deliveries suppress rent growth in Sun Belt markets while the relative\nlack of new supply in the Midwest\nhas benefited owners of existing properties.\nThe suburban submarket benefits from Chicago\u2019s strong job base without the\nhassles of Cook County\u2019s complicated property tax system\n. The Chicago suburbs have consistently risen the ranks of the county\u2019s most competitive rental markets, alongside cities like Miami, according to data compiled by companies like RentCafe.\nDRA Advisors, which is based in New York, has previously made headlines for\nselling off most of its $540 million Midwest retail portfolio\nthat was concentrated in the Chicago area. Now, the firm now appears ready to grow its multifamily holdings in the region.\n\nWith the purchase of the Fox Valley Villages, Standard and Vistria now jointly own 836 units in the Aurora/Naperville submarket. Last year, they bought the 416-unit Haven on Long Grove apartments and townhomes in Aurora for $94 million, including a $46 million Fannie Mae loan assumption.\n\u201cThe Aurora/Naperville submarket is among the strongest in the Chicago MSA with a high barrier to entry,\u201d Jerome Nichols, president and co-founder of Standard, said in a statement.\nThe prior owner of Standard\u2019s latest acquisition, Utah-based\nBridge Investment Group\nwhich was absorbed by Apollo Global Management earlier this year, purchased the property for $72 million with a $54 million mortgage from Wells Fargo in 2021.\nThe sprawling complex is made up of 18, three-story buildings across 21 acres. It includes 208 one-bedroom units and 212 two-bedroom units with an overall occupancy rate of 97 percent. Standard and Vistria plan to invest over $8 million on renovations, they said in a statement.\nDRA, Bridge and Cantor didn\u2019t return requests for comment.\n",

        "content": "An Oak Brook mansion has sold for $5.3 million, the highest price achieved for a home sale in the western suburb of Chicago in 16 years.\nThe one-acre property at 412 Fox Trail Court sits on a cul-de-sac in the gated Hunter Trails community, near a forest preserve and golf courses. The contemporary-style house has five bedrooms and seven-and-a-half bathrooms, and 10,000 square feet of living space, with a pool in the back, according to real estate listings.\nSales above $5 million are rare in the western suburbs, and demand has been mixed, with some properties selling relatively quickly and some sitting on the market for months or more. Michael Lafido with LPT Realty, who represented the seller on the Fox Trail Court house, said there was huge demand for the listing, which sold for $105,000 over asking.\n\u201cWe had multiple offers and we had 14 showings in two weeks, and even when we were under contract, we had a handful of agents begging to get in there to see it,\u201d LaFido said. \u201cYou don\u2019t typically see that kind of activity at $2 million, let alone $5 million and up.\u201d\nThe previous owner bought the\nhouse in 2023 for $4.75 million\n. It was listed for $5.2 million in August and went under contract less than a month later. Peggy Sersen with Redfin represented the buyer.\n\nLafido and Sersen declined to share details about the seller and buyer. The home was previously held under a trust, and property tax bills were addressed to Nikola Kozul. Records that would indicate the buyer aren\u2019t yet available.\nThe previous owner paid $38,600 in property taxes this year, property records show.\nThe $5.3 million sale price marks the highest Oak Brook home sale since 2009, when a nearby mansion on Adams Road sold for $5.45 million. The village\u2019s record was set in 2003, when\nChicago White Sox Hall of Famer Frank Thomas\nsold his 27,000 square-foot mansion for $7.95 million. The house has traded a few times since then, most recently for $4.5 million in 2021.\nOnly a few other Oak Brook homes have sold for more than $4 million since 2020, according to public listing services. An 11,000 square-foot mansion on Oak Court brought in $4 million in December, and a 12,000 square-foot property on Breakenridge Farm Road brought in $4.8 million in 2023.\nOak Brook luxury listings are slim: One home is listed publicly above $4 million in the village, an\nornate castle-style estate\nthat went on the market in April for just under $5 million.\n",

In some markets, the increases were sharper: One-bedroom rents jumped nearly 17 percent in Waukegan and Gurnee.\nOccupancy rates are tight at 97.5 percent.\n\nMedian rents increased by 6 percent for two-bedroom apartments in McHenry County and by 5.5 percent in Naperville and Aurora year-over-year.\nThe suburban luxury boom cuts across demographics. Empty nesters and retirees are trading single-family homes for maintenance-free apartments. Younger families are renting in good school districts while waiting out high mortgage rates. And professionals untethered from downtown commutes are opting for suburban properties that blend comfort with convenience.\nDevelopers are taking note. Bradford Allen is planning Arbor House, a 301-unit project in Arlington Heights with co-working space and 25,000 square feet of ground-floor retail.\nIn Skokie, Tucker Development and Wingspan Development recently debuted\nThe Henry at Harms Woods\n\u2014 245 apartments and 49 townhomes spread over 11 acres, with a pool, yoga studio and conference rooms.\nAnd in Winnetka, Murphy Development Group and Harrison Street secured financing from Acres Capital this summer for the $89 million\nOne Winnetka\nproject, a plan to turn a 1.2-acre parcel at Lincoln Street and Elm Avenue into 59 luxury apartments with 20,000 square feet of retail space. The total project cost is pegged at $89 million, which amounts to $1.5 million per residential unit.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "CBRE\u2019s Industrious co-working outfit is growing its Bay Area footprint with an expansion in Burlingame.\nThe Los Angeles-based co-working unit of the giant brokerage has leased approximately 19,800 square feet of offices on the fourth floor of 220 Park. The $180 million development at 220 Park Road recently transformed a former post office into high-end offices in the heart of Burlingame, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nDostart Development Company and\nSares Regis\npartnered to build 220 Park. Industrious\u2019 lease will take up about two-thirds of the building\u2019s fourth floor, making the co-working company the largest tenant the developers have landed so far. Last year, private equity firm SkyKnight Capital leased about 10,000 square feet at the property. Dostart and Sares Regis could also be solidifying another lease with another firm, sources familiar with negotiations told the Business Times.\nThe 220 Park building, located near the\nBurlingame Caltrain station\n, is also expected to include a restaurant from a Michelin-starred hospitality group. In total, the building has about 168,000 square feet of offices and 17,000 square feet of retail.\nIndustrious views Burlingame as a market ripe for activity between San Francisco and Palo Alto as professionals across the Peninsula who want to work closer to home could have a new place to set up camp\u2013a hybrid model somewhere between work-from-home and return-to-office.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of coworking in San Francisco and a fair amount in Palo Alto, but nothing in Burlingame,\u201d Peri Demestihas, head of real estate for Industrious, told the Business Times. \u201cIt\u2019s a pocket filled with folks who say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to go into San Francisco or Palo Alto. I want to live and work here.\u2019\u201d\nWhile growing tech firms relied on co-working spaces like WeWork offices to expand quickly, they\u2019ve since shifted more to hybrid work in their own offices. The artificial intelligence boom in the Bay Area at large is a prime example of the trend, as companies from OpenAI and\nAnthropic\nto\nGlean\nand\nSnowflake\nsearch for or build AI-focused office space across the Peninsula and South and East Bay.\nIn addition to the new Industrious location in Burlingame, the company is growing in the South Bay with two locations in development near Stanford.\nIn total, businesses and research and development companies sought 4.3 million square feet of office space in the Peninsula, according to CBRE data cited by the Business Times. That marks a 57 percent jump from the second quarter. Leasing activity, meanwhile, was up 76 percent.\nCBRE took full ownership of Industrious\nearlier this year in an acquisition valuing the company at $800 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Two of the other units are also in contract, asking nearly double what they originally were in 2009.\nThe penthouse spans over 3,800 square feet and includes five bedrooms and four bathrooms. The home comes with three private terraces and a private roofdeck outfitted with an automatic irrigation system.\nA keyed elevator opens up onto each floor of the home. The primary suite comes with a walk-in closet, a south-facing terrace and ensuite bathroom with a stand-alone tub and double shower.\n\nCompass\u2019 Toni Nicolo and Brown Harris Stevens\u2019 Jennifer Cooke had the listing.\nThe second priciest contract last week went to a Cobble Hill townhouse at 339 Clinton Street asking $5.7 million.\nSpanning 4,000 square feet, the home comes with seven bedrooms and five bathrooms. The seller is Lindsey Branca, who owns a residential restoration and renovation firm, Branca &amp; Co.

The homes that went pending last week total $67.4 million in asking dollar volume and averaged 119 days on the market.\nThe previous week\n, buyers signed 10 contracts totaling $47.6 million in asking dollar volume.\nThe report tracks signed contracts for single-family homes and condos asking $3 million or more in the Beaches MLS. It identified 58 new listings, and a total of 1,078 active listings on the market.\nAll of the properties that found buyers last week were single-family homes. The average asking price was $6.1 million, or $1,151 per square foot.\n\nThe most expensive listing to find a buyer is the 9,200-square-foot mansion at 1162 Banyan Estates Drive, asking $15.9 million.

        "content": "Most of the\nnew Texas laws affecting business\ntook effect last month, but a few are constitutional amendments up for statewide vote, plus a few local propositions on, Nov. 4.\nAmong the most consequential ballot measures is a referendum on\nProject Marvel\n, the $4 billion plan for a downtown mixed-use development built around a new Spurs arena.\nProposition B would allow Bexar County to use $311 million of the venue tax money to fund the arena.\u00a0 Proposition A would raise the county\u2019s hotel occupancy tax to collect $197 million to redevelop the San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo grounds.\nThe\nproject\nalso includes a convention center expansion, a 5,000-seat entertainment venue in the John Woods Courthouse and upgrades to the Alamodome. Local leaders have sought funding from a variety of sources, including tax credits, venue taxes and the\nSpurs organization\n.\nNewly elected\nSan Antonio Mayor Gina Ortiz has been skeptica\nl of the project and the size of the team\u2019s contribution.\nA\nrecent poll\nfound middling support for both measures.\nHere\u2019s what is on the statewide ballot.\nProtecting Y\u2019all Street\nProposition 6 is basically red carpeting for\nY\u2019all Street\n. The measure would prohibit the legislature from imposing an occupation tax on financial market operators, such as exchanges, and from creating new taxes on securities transactions. Sponsors filed the legislation in response to proposed taxes in New York and New Jersey which prompted Nasdaq to consider moving to Texas.\n\nProperty taxes\nThree statewide provisions would offer property tax relief. Proposition 11 would authorize the legislature to raise the school property tax exemption for elderly and disabled homeowners from $10,000 to $60,000. Proposition 13 would raise the homestead exemption from school district property taxes from $100,000 to $140,000 for all homeowners. Proposition 17 would authorize the legislature to cap the value of land in Texas border counties if it appreciates due to border security improvements.\nAt the local level, Austin voters will consider Proposition Q, a property tax rate hike. The increased revenue will support programs intended to increase housing affordability and reduce homelessness, according to the city, including $12 million to fund 350 new housing units.\nInheritance tax\nTexas doesn\u2019t have an inheritance tax, but Proposition 8 would permanently ban the legislature from establishing one.\nAn inheritance tax is a levy on bequests. The heir is responsible for paying the tax.\nThe amendment would ban such taxes on the state level, as well as taxes on the transfers of estates, inheritances, successions or gifts from one person, family, estate or trust to another. Estate taxes are similar to inheritance taxes but are paid by the estate or trust itself before distribution to heirs.\nA tenth of recent American homebuyers relied on an inheritance for their purchase, according to\nRedfin\n. An inheritance tax could shrink this share of buyers in Texas, or reduce their buying power.\nFive states have an inheritance tax. There is also a federal estate tax, though it\u2019s only required for estates with combined gross assets and prior taxable gifts exceeding $15 million, or $30 million for married couples.\n",

        "content": "A demolition company has agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle claims that it repeatedly flouted New York\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation laws, retaliated against injured workers and failed to address reports of sexual harassment.\nAlba Services, a nonunion demolition subcontractor, must pay $1.4 million to nearly 700 current and former employees, as well as $100,000 to a settlement administrator who will coordinate those payments to employees, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced Tuesday.\nAlba allegedly failed to report hundreds of workplace injuries between 2016 and 2024, which allowed the company to lower its insurance costs. The company also threatened employees who tried to file workers\u2019 compensation claims, according to the attorney general\u2019s office.\nThe settlement comes after the laborers\u2019 union, Local 79, launched a public\ncampaign\nagainst the firm in 2022, accusing Alba of offering rewards for information on employees who filed \u201cfalse\u201d workers\u2019 compensation claims as an intimidation tactic. The attorney general\u2019s office began investigating Alba in 2022, after receiving information from the union.\nThe investigation confirmed allegations previously publicized by the union, according to the attorney general\u2019s office.\nFor instance, the firm posted flyers naming workers who filed such claims, accused them of fraud and offered $5,000 for information leading to their arrests, officials said. Andrew Horan, Alba\u2019s owner, allegedly sent text messages to his construction foremen, unlawfully naming workers who filed claims and offering cash for information about them. The attorney general\u2019s office found the company wrongfully disclosed employees\u2019 names on at least 60 occasions.\nState officials also accused Alba of sending company representatives to hospitals and urgent care centers with injured employees, in order to feed incorrect information to medical professionals about how and where workers were injured. The company also allegedly directed injured workers to specific clinics to hide workplace injuries, even in cases where the employee required emergency care.\n\nIn a press release, James\u2019 office also described two women who were sexually harassed by an Alba foreman. When the workers rejected the foreman\u2019s advances, he assigned them more demanding work, and in one case, cut hours.\nAs part of the settlement agreement, Alba must fire the foreman and adopt anti-harassment policies and training. The company will also be overseen by the attorney general\u2019s office for at least three years, and must file biannual reports showing that it is complying with workers\u2019 compensation and human rights laws.\nA message left for Alba, and an email sent to Horan seeking comment were not immediately returned.\nSeparately, in 2023, Alba was one of 26 companies\nindicted\nin a wide-ranging construction kickback scheme. Alba received $2.8 million in inflated contracts and change orders at 250 Fifth Avenue and 189 Bowery, the indictment claimed.\nLocal 79 has targeted other nonunion firms over the years, some of which have resulted in action by the attorney general. In 2020, James\nbrokered\nan agreement with TradeOff Construction Services to settle allegations that the firm didn\u2019t address sexual harassment reported by its employees.\nDuring its campaign against Alba, the union called on developers and even\npension fund managers\nto sever ties with the subcontractor. The union protested Alba\u2019s work at Columbia Property Trust and\nL&amp;L Holding\n\u2019s Terminal Warehouse and Rockrose\u2019s redevelopment of the St. Francis College building.\n\u201cThis settlement isn\u2019t just about Alba, it is about non-union workers throughout the city who suffer under similar circumstances,\u201d Anthony Vita, business manager at Local 79, said in a statement. \u201cThis is an important step in leveling the playing field for responsible contractors.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Fresh off completing the largest known 3D-printed homes community in Texas, Lennar is proposing to incorporate 3D-printed homes in one of its south Miami-Dade County projects.\nMiami-based Lennar, led by Stuart Miller and Jon Jaffe, is proposing 3D-printed model homes at the 31-acre development site where it plans 88 homes in the Redland neighborhood, according to its application filed last week.\nThe development site is on the northeast corner of Southwest 288th Street and Krome Avenue in unincorporated Miami-Dade. Lennar paid\n$16.3 million\nfor the property in September.\nThe 3-D printing applies only to the model homes, but the move signals that Lennar is expanding its use of the efficient construction technology to South Florida. This spring, Lennar completed a\n100-home community\nin Georgetown, Texas, where all homes were 3D-printed. Lennar partnered with Austin, Texas-based Icon on that project.\nLennar has a reputation for its efficient development and sales approach.\nIn 3D-printed homes, a large printer \u201clayers a concrete-like material to form the structural walls of each residence,\u201d Lennar\u2019s attorney, Alberto Torres, wrote in the application. The homes will be \u201cdurable, code-compliant\u201d and \u201carchitecturally comparable in scale and appearance\u201d to the conventional homes already approved for the project.\n\nLennar, co-founded by Miller\u2019s late father, Leonard Miller, in the 1950s, is the second biggest homebuilder in the U.S. and the\nmost dominant one\nin south Miami-Dade. The area \u2013\u2013 home to the municipalities of Homestead and Florida City, as well as the neighborhoods of Naranja, Princeton, Leisure City, Goulds, Perrine and Redland \u2013\u2013 has an ample supply of buildable land that sells for less than sites in Miami\u2019s prime areas.\nLennar holds a near-monopoly on south Miami-Dade homebuilding through its partnerships with land banks, which allow it to stockpile development sites until it\u2019s ready to start developing them.\nSome of Lennar\u2019s other south Miami-Dade projects are a planned\n106-townhome community\non the northwest corner of Southwest 338th Street and Southwest 192nd Avenue near Homestead.\nNear Goulds, Lennar plans Rodan Estates with\n138 homes\non the southeast corner of Southwest 220th Street and Southwest 133rd Court.\nIn its biggest proposal, Lennar, in partnership with developers Ed Easton and Bill Albers, wants to develop\nCity Park\nwith 7,800 residential units that will include single-family homes, townhomes and apartments; 2.4 million square feet of commercial space, including office space, retail, dining and schools; and open space. The project is proposed for a nearly 1,000-acre land tract in south Miami-Dade, outside Miami-Dade\u2019s Urban Development Boundary, the line meant to curb suburban sprawl west toward the Everglades.\nCity Park requires a supermajority approval from Miami-Dade commissioners.\n",

        "content": "A McKinney office building traded hands, giving rare insight into how\nsuburban office\nsales compare to\nsimilar transactions\nin hotspots like Uptown.\nKaizen Development Partners offloaded an 8-story, 190,000-square-foot office building at 7300 State Highway 121, deed records show. The property was built in 2022 as part of District 121, a mixed-use development with restaurants and a hotel.\nColliers\u2019 Randall Book, Jason Roth and Jack Beare represented the buyer, Eckard Enterprises, which is an oil and gas firm based in Allen.\nTraded\nreported\nthat the building sold for $66 million, or $346 per square foot. That rate is less than half of what a similar building in Uptown fetched earlier this year.\nIn August, Atlanta-based Cousins Properties bought the 292,000-square-foot\nThe Link in Uptown for $218 million\n, or more than $746 per square foot. The property was delivered in 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, a 2008-built office property in Uptown sold for more than $588 per square foot when German investor Union Investment Real Estate sold 2000 McKinney to Crescent Real Estate. The German investor said in a release that the sale price topped the property\u2019s $291.5 million valuation, putting the price per square foot for the 485,000-square-foot building at around $600.\nThe sales comparison shows even trophy offices in the \u2019burbs aren\u2019t fetching the same prices as new builds in Uptown, which has become the nexus of built-to-suit office development for financial services firms, nicknamed\nY\u2019all Street\n.\nOffice markets in the North Dallas suburbs have performed particularly well as companies look to locate near where employees live.\nThe Allen-McKinney submarket had a vacancy rate of 20.1 percent, the lowest rate on the Dallas side of the Metroplex except for Preston Center, where vacancy was just 7.9 percent, according to a recent report from Avison Young.\nUptown\u2019s vacancy rate hovers around the overall level for the Metroplex, at 25.5 percent. It also has more than four times the office inventory as Allen-McKinney.\n",

Builder and pricing details are still under wraps.\nJohnson Development has made refinements to the original plan, expanding the community\u2019s open-space and recreation features, CEO Michael Smith said.\nRoughly 1,200 acres \u2014 nearly 40 percent of the property \u2014 will be preserved as green space, with 26 miles of trails winding through heavily wooded stretches along Hickory Creek. The community will also feature two lakes, a pair of amenity centers, a 50-acre city park and a 55-acre business park.\nOn the civic side, about 206 acres will be reserved for two elementary schools, a middle school and a high school within the Denton ISD. Another 156 acres are earmarked for commercial use.\n\nThe site is just south of Hillwood\u2019s 3,200-acre\nLandmark\nproject.\nDenton Range, managed by Silvestri Investments, is an investor in the project. Johnson Development is already active in North Texas with its\nViridian\ncommunity in Arlington and\nTrinity Falls\nin McKinney.\nPlans for Cole Ranch stretch back to the mid-2010s, when the city first held public hearings on the massive residential proposal.\nThe Texas Legislature approved a municipal management district for the site in 2019. Earlier this year, Denton City Council tweaked the zoning for more than 300 acres from light industrial land in favor of residential and mixed-use development, signaling the city\u2019s shift toward a more community-oriented buildout.\nThe property has deep local roots. The Cole family has owned the land since the 1930s, when Miner Thomas \u201cM.T.\u201d Cole ran it as a working ranch. His great-granddaughter Jennifer Alexander said the family sought a partner that would honor the history and the beauty of the area.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A decade after a debut that aimed to enshrine it as a gleaming symbol of ultraluxury living, Manhattan\u2019s 432 Park Avenue \u2014 the pencil-thin supertall that helped define Billionaires\u2019 Row \u2014 is cracking, literally and figuratively.\nOnce marketed as the epitome of perfection, the 1,400-foot tower faces a nine-figure repair bill and a wave of lawsuits as experts warn that its sleek white concrete shell is deteriorating, the New York Times\nreported\n. Consultants hired by residents estimate repairs could exceed $160 million.\nEngineers documented hundreds of fractures and spalling concrete along the facade, raising concerns that wind stress and water infiltration could eventually render parts of the 102-story tower unsafe or even uninhabitable.\nInspectors maintain the building poses no immediate danger, but recent filings show missing chunks of concrete and cracks forming in load-bearing sections. Independent engineers say the building\u2019s all-white concrete \u2014 chosen for its pristine aesthetic \u2014 may have compromised its strength.\nDeveloper Harry Macklowe and the late architect Rafael Vi\u00f1oly insisted on a flawless white exterior to distinguish the project from Midtown\u2019s glassy competition. But that design decision set off years of internal warnings, email clashes and rejected fixes during construction.\n\u201cColor or cracks,\u201d one structural engineer for the project cautioned in 2012, after developers refused to use a darker, more durable concrete mix. The cracks appeared anyway.\n\nThe tower\u2019s woes \u2014 from creaking walls to burst pipes and elevator malfunctions \u2014 have since\nspawned litigation\nbetween its condo board and the development team, including Macklowe Properties and CIM Group.\nThe board alleges the developers sold defective units and concealed structural flaws. CIM denies wrongdoing, calling the deterioration claims \u201cbaseless\u201d and blaming the board for poor maintenance.\nMacklowe and WSP, responsible for the tower\u2019s structural engineering, declined to comment to the Times. Vi\u00f1oly\u2019s firm did not respond to requests for comment.\nWhile\nlitigation\nand debate rage on, resident concerns about property values and broader concerns about safety for tenants and the community living in the shadow of the tower press on, too.\nAs one engineer put it, \u201cA 10-year-old building should not be showing that level of deterioration. Nobody can argue that that is not a failure.\u201d\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

That represents all of the office space at the 38,000-square-foot property, a building that has been largely vacant since RFR acquired it ten years ago.\nThe asking rent on the space was $95 per square foot.

RFR acquired the property in 2015 for $55 million and modernized much of it while removing graffiti from the upper floors.\n\nWhen RFR\nagreed to acquire\nthe building, it was reported that it could be converted to a mix of condos and retail, offices or an art gallery.

An asking price hasn\u2019t been disclosed.\nThe listing includes the rental apartments, 974 parking spaces, and roughly 56,000 square feet of commercial space at the base. The Radisson Blu hotel and privately owned condos within the mixed-use tower are not part of the offering.\n\nKnown for its rippling white balconies that mimic waves, Aqua is one of Gang\u2019s signature works and a centerpiece of the Lakeshore East development between Millennium Park, the Chicago River and Lake Michigan. The architect, who received the Urban Land Institute\u2019s top honor in 2022, also designed the 101-story\nSt. Regis Chicago\nnearby.\nThe offering comes as investors are circling Chicago\u2019s multifamily sector, despite elevated borrowing costs.\nRoughly 4,200 downtown apartments have hit the market in recent months as landlords test pricing amid heated rent growth. Chicago has led major U.S. metros in rent gains, fueled by limited new supply and higher construction costs. In a recent benchmark deal, local operator Waterton paid $89.5 million for\nThe Mason\n, a 263-unit tower in Fulton Market.\nAqua is 95 percent leased, with new rents up nearly 5 percent this year, according to JLL marketing materials. The brokers are touting the property\u2019s 110,000 square feet of amenities \u2014 including an outdoor running track, indoor lap pool and basketball court \u2014 and pitching it as a value-add play through unit upgrades and rent lifts.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The seller was Houston-based Hanover Company, which developed the property at 3050 Del Hombre and opened it to residents in 2023.\nThe transaction marks the second time in the past two months that large apartment complexes in Walnut Creek that were built in recent years have sold for more than $150 million.\nIn August, an affiliate of San Mateo-based real estate investment firm Acacia Capital bought the\nWaymark apartment complex\nat 101 Pringle Avenue for $190 million, or $530,700 per unit. That 358-unit property was sold by Blake Griggs Properties and Transit Village Associates, which developed the property.\nLast month, a Fresno-based investor group led by Valley Yellow Pages CEO Siegried Fisher plunked down $31 million for the\nAtrium Downtown apartments\nin Walnut Creek. The seller of the 78-unit property at 1812 Trinity Avenue was Walnut Creek-based Sequoia Entities, which sold the complex for $397,400 per unit.\n\nThe 97-unit Rise apartments at 1380 North California Boulevard sold to a Hines affiliate last May for $57 million. Florida-based Rescore Property sold the property for about $587,600 per unit.\nElsewhere in Walnut Creek, more housing is in the pipeline in an effort to meet state-mandated housing goals.\nLocal property owner Steve Depper, for example,\nsubmitted a preapplication\nto city officials to build a 74-unit apartment building on the site of Dutch Girl Cleaners at 2094 Mount Diablo Boulevard. Depper ran the dry cleaning business for more than two decades before retiring and selling the business, though he remains the property\u2019s landlord.\nBoston-based TA Realty has been in operation since 1982 and owns real estate assets across the country ranging from apartments and retail properties to offices, industrial sites and the rapidly growing category of data centers.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The future of one of Dallas\u2019 most recognizable landmarks \u2014 I.M. Pei\u2019s inverted-pyramid City Hall \u2014 is up for debate.\nCity Council is deciding whether the city should pour hundreds of millions into deferred maintenance for the aging municipal headquarters or sell it outright, potentially opening the downtown site to private redevelopment, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nAn\narena for the Dallas Mavericks\nis among the plays being pitched for the site.\nThe conversation marks the first major undertaking for Mayor Eric Johnson\u2019s new Committee on Government Efficiency, tasked with reviewing Dallas\u2019 vast real estate holdings \u2014 starting with the seven-story, 1 million-square-foot building at\n1500 Marilla Street\n.\nThe cost to fix it isn\u2019t small. Deferred maintenance has surpassed $100 million, with documents pegging the total rehabilitation bill anywhere between $152 million and $345 million.\nAbout $50 million of that is tied to the parking garage alone, which has leaks and flooding \u2014 problems that date back to before the building opened in 1978. Other fixes include an outdated HVAC system, roof replacement, plumbing and ADA upgrades, and a long-broken cafeteria grease trap.\nCouncil member\nChad West\n, who sits on the new committee, said the issue has been kicked down the road for decades.\n\u201cIt will be an emotional decision,\u201d West told the outlet. \u201cBut we have a responsibility to act like grown-ups.\u201d\n\nWest acknowledged that while the building holds historical significance, maintenance hasn\u2019t been a top public priority amid other pressing needs like public safety and infrastructure.\nPreservationists, however, argue that selling City Hall would be a grave mistake. Sarah Crain of Preservation Dallas said the building is more than just a workplace \u2014 it\u2019s \u201cthe people\u2019s building,\u201d designed to symbolize Dallas\u2019 renewal after President Kennedy\u2019s assassination.\n\u201cThe conversation shouldn\u2019t be about why we are investing in City Hall,\u201d Crain said. \u201cIt should be about why aren\u2019t we?\u201d\nDallas Morning News architecture critic Mark Lamster echoed that view, calling demolition \u201can act of epic mismanagement.\u201d He pointed to Boston\u2019s renovation of its own Brutalist city hall as a model for Dallas.\nStill, others see opportunity in the dirt under Marilla Street. City Hall sits on prime downtown land that could attract a major developer \u2014 even a sports franchise. With the Mavericks\nexploring arena options\n, some have floated the idea of repurposing the site for a new entertainment anchor.\nCity documents suggest relocating City Hall to a nearby office tower, with candidates including Bank of America Plaza and Comerica Bank Tower. The city owns roughly\n5,800 properties\n, and the debate comes as leaders aim to modernize downtown and reassure investors after missteps like the ill-fated \u201c\nLemon on Stemmons\n,\u201d a $29 million permitting-office debacle that ended in a fire sale.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Fort Partners will proceed with its buyout of a West Palm Beach condominium following a legal skirmish with Related Ross that ended in a settlement last week,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nThe legal battle that started with a Related Ross affiliate filing a request for an injunction in April came to a close on Friday, Oct. 17, when\nSteve Ross\n\u2019 Related and Nadim Ashi\u2019s\nFort Partners\nsettled out of court, Ashi\u2019s attorney Glen Waldman confirmed. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Waldman confirmed Fort Partners plans to move forward with a condo termination for Harbor Towers, the 2-acre, two-building, 61-unit complex at 3901 South Flagler Drive.\nRepresentatives for Related did not respond to immediate requests for comment.\nWhile it was the fight for control of Harbor Towers that precipitated the legal battle, the true scope of the developers\u2019 entanglement spans three waterfront sites totaling nearly 4.3 waterfront acres. It\u2019s a sizable swath of waterfront land across the Intracoastal Waterway from Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club, at a time when few waterfront sites in West Palm Beach remain.\nThe sites they targeted include Harbor Towers, as well as the 60-unit condominium Southbridge at 3915 South Flagler Drive and a multifamily complex at 3907 South Flagler Drive and 3906 Washington Road.\n\nRelated and Fort Partners made competing offers to owners at Southbridge last year, with Related\u2019s $42 million bid winning out. The price works out to $700,000 per unit, in a building where the property appraiser estimates market value for most units at about $200,000. Records show Related affiliate Southbridge Acquisitions LLC has closed on 17 units since December. It is unclear if or when Related plans to close on the remaining units.\nAshi\u2019s affiliate WPB S Flagler Owner LLC bought the adjacent apartment complex at 3906 Washington Road and 3907 South Flagler Drive for $20 million in November, records show.\nRelated\u2019s affiliate Harbor Towers Acquisitions LLC and Ashi\u2019s affiliate WPB Harbor Towers Acquisition LLC started inking competing deals with Harbor Towers in the spring. Waldman said Fort had deals in place with the majority of units and had secured control of the condo board when the Related affiliate filed its suit in Palm Beach County Circuit Court in April, requesting an injunction to block Fort\u2019s changes to the condominium declaration. The legal fight escalated in September, when Related filed motions for protective orders to block the deposition of Steve Ross and Related executive vice president Jordan Bargas. Fort\u2019s attorneys responded, accusing Related of stalling under the guise of settlement talks. Two weeks later, a deal was signed.\nFort\u2019s attorney, Waldman, who represents the holdout owners in the\nBiscayne 21 case against Two Roads Development\n, said he was comfortable representing a developer in this case because of the prices Fort Partners offered in its buyout. Recorded sales to Fort\u2019s Harbor Towers affiliate range in price from $1 million to $3.3 million, more than double the market values assessed by the property appraiser.\n\u201cThe amount of money being offered was significantly in excess of what [the units] were worth,\u201d he said. \u201cThese owners were making so much money, there are no losers here.\u201d",

It later discovered other lenders actually held liens on several of those same buildings, so Zions was left out in the cold when the properties went into liquidation.\nWestern Alliance similarly filed a complaint in August claiming the same investor group, led by Stupin and\nprolific landlord and Republican donor Gerald Marcil\n, owes it nearly $99 million after the investors allegedly failed to disclose that some of the collateral properties were already in foreclosure.\nStupin is accused across five lawsuits of guaranteeing roughly $115 million in loans tied to properties near Los Angeles and San Francisco; those loans are now in default.

        "content": "A historic office building in San Francisco\u2019s Financial District took a dramatic\nvaluation hit\nrecently.\nSwift Real Estate Partners\u2019\nbuilding at 260 California Street was most recently\nvalued\nat $13 million, per an August note to commercial mortgage-backed securities bond holders, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The appraisal amounts to $464 per square foot and a drop of 60 percent.\nThe 28,000-square-foot building was valued at $32.2 million in 2015.\nThe loan backed by the property was transferred to special servicing this spring, after Google left the building, out of fear of imminent default due to decreasing occupancy and cash flow at the building.\nThe debt originated at almost $19.8 million and matured in April; the outstanding balance was just shy of $17 million earlier this month.\nThree of the building\u2019s largest tenants had leases at the building that were scheduled to expire by September.\n\nGoogle\noccupied about 20 percent of the building with a 9,200-square-foot lease that expired in April. The Alphabet-owned company has been slimming down its Bay Area office portfolio in recent years, declining to renew several downtown leases last year, including a 342,000 square feet at One Market Plaza.\nCitibank is next to head out the door. The banking giant will close its branch at 260 California in February, in addition to a location at 245 Market Street, in favor of its new location at 1 California Street.\nWith the large leases expiring, the building\u2019s vacancy hovers around 50 percent, David Putro, head of commercial real estate analytics for Morningstar Credit, told the outlet. At the time of its initial appraisal in 2015, the property was 96 percent occupied. Up until the most recent vacancies, the loan tied to the building had performed well.\nSwift Real Estate Partners is working with the special servicer under a pre-negotiation agreement and has submitted a proposal for loan modification.\nThe building was erected in 1910 and renovated in 2009. The property has a penthouse space known as Newhall Nest, which is used as a tenant amenity and private event space.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The debt works out to $355 per square foot.\nThe auction is scheduled for Nov. 4 at 10 a.m. at the Dallas County Courthouse. It\u2019s possible that Harwood and First United could work out a loan extension to avoid the sale. Harwood didn\u2019t respond to TRD\u2019s request for comment in time for publication.\n\nAs its name suggests, Harwood No. 1 was the firm\u2019s first office development, built in 1984 for Rolex. In April, the building was just 54.1 percent leased.\nThe foreclosure comes six months after Harwood\nhanded back the keys to Harwood No. 4\nand 10 months after a\nlast-minute recapitalization deal\nsaved Saint Ann Court (Harwood No. 6) from foreclosure.\nThe Dallas-based developer allegedly defaulted on an $80 million mortgage tied to Harwood No. 4, a 20-story, 221,000-square-foot office building at 2828 North Harwood Street. San Francisco-based Spear Street Capital took back that 221,000-square-foot property in a $73 million credit bid.\nSaint Ann Court, a 25-story office building at 2501 North Harwood Street, was set to be auctioned on Jan. 7, but Harwood reached a deal with Life Company to recapitalize the property. With the fresh financing, Harwood repaid its $138 million mortgage.\n",

        "content": "The rising cost of keeping New York\u2019s affordable housing afloat has reached crisis levels.\nA new report from Enterprise Community Partners and the National Equity Fund found operating costs for nearly 40,000 government-funded apartments in the state surged about 40 percent since 2017. Insurance premiums more than doubled in that period, a spike that could jeopardize long-term affordability, Gothamist\nreported\n.\nThe analysis covered 428 developments comprising 37,130 income-restricted units that rely on public subsidies to cap rents. Property and liability insurance proved the most volatile expense, climbing so fast that one policy expert likened it to \u201ca runaway train for New York.\u201d\nRent collections also declined, dropping from roughly 95 to 91 percent between 2017 and 2024, resulting in lost revenue and growing expenses.\nFor the nonprofit landlords that dominate this sector (roughly two-thirds of owners), the squeeze is severe. Kieran Harrington, chief executive officer of RiseBoro \u2014 which manages more than 4,000 affordable units citywide \u2014 said his group\u2019s insurance costs ballooned from about $5 million in 2024 to $11.3 million this year. The organization is deferring maintenance and weighing cuts to resident services to stay afloat.\nEnterprise\u2019s Patrick Boyle, who helped author the study, said raising rents isn\u2019t an option for deeply affordable properties. Instead, he urged city and state officials to step in with funding streams for repairs, expanded rental assistance programs like CityFHEPS and collective insurance strategies to counter market volatility.\n\nThat recommendation echoes a broader debate in this year\u2019s mayoral race, where candidates have seized on affordability \u2014 and landlords\u2019 cost burdens \u2014 as defining issues.\nDemocratic nominee Assembly member Zohran Mamdani has championed a landlord insurance collective known as Milford Street, seeded with\n$2 million in state support\n, as a model for stabilizing expenses. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent, has pushed for longer-term subsidies, while Republican Curtis Sliwa has focused on rolling back tenant protections.\nBehind the political rhetoric lies a stark math problem: with costs outpacing revenues, nonprofit operators face the prospect of losing buildings that anchor the city\u2019s affordable stock, threatening tenants.\nAs Boyle put it, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to exacerbate a housing instability crisis, a homelessness crisis and a cost of living crisis in New York.\u201d\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The seller was an entity linked to the estate of the late Dubai businessman Iyer Vaidyanathan Narayan.\nThe 10-story, 75,000-square-foot building \u2014 home to the Chatwal and the Lambs Club restaurant \u2014 sits on land owned by the Metro New York District Church of the Nazarene. Narayan took over the ground lease in 2013 for $115 million, according to\nPincusCo\n, which first reported the sale.\nThe deal comes almost two years after a lender run by the London-based billionaire Reuben Brothers launched a non-judicial foreclosure on the hotel\u2019s debt. The Reubens sought to seize the leasehold after Narayan allegedly defaulted on a $62.5 million loan. The debt was expected to swell to $79 million by the time of a scheduled auction in January 2024.\n\nBut the auction never happened, and the case wound its way through the state Supreme Court for more than two years. Narayan died in February 2024, according to court filings, and the case was recently settled.\nSant Singh Chatwal\u2019s Hampshire Hotels redeveloped the 1905 Art Deco property and opened the Chatwal in 2010. In 2022, Hyatt took over the operations of the Chatwal, along with a portfolio of other hotel brands.\nThat same year, shipping company Astra Global sued Narayan, alleging that he secretly misappropriated $50 million from Astra\u2019s accounts and used it to invest in the\u202fChatwal\u202fand several other properties, according to\nBusiness Insider\n.\nRepresentatives for Ben-Josef Group, Narayan\u2019s estate and Reuben Brothers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",

Inland from Pompano Beach, it marks the homebuilder\u2019s latest bet on Broward County.

Among the homebuilder\u2019s other South Florida projects are\na 42-unit luxury single-family home community in Wellington\n, planned for a 22.5-acre site it bought from the Catholic Church for $11.7 million last year.

The Racys bought the property for $675,000 in 1998, according to property records. The 5,700-square-foot Dunbar Road home was built in 2002 and has five bedrooms, five bathrooms, two half-bathrooms and a pool. Combined, the properties total 0.7 acres.\nThe Dunbar Road home was listed for $31.9 million last year, and the asking price was slashed twice before delisting in May, according to Zillow.\nIt marks the latest pricey deal in Palm Beach, as the island ramps up for its busy season. Earlier this month, private equity billionaire Greg Mondre\ndropped $58 million\non a 1.2-acre oceanfront lot, after buying a non-waterfront home for\n$31 million\nin March. Also this month, billionaire SC Johnson heiress Winifred Johnson-Marquart bought a landmarked home for\n$30 million\n.

Apartment construction ramped up in the broader\nMontrose-River Oaks\narea during the pandemic but has since slowed, with no new multifamily projects starting in the district this year, a first since 2009, according to CoStar data.\n\nThat surge in supply suppressed rent growth in the submarket, leaving the average rent of $2,024 in\nMontrose\nflat for three consecutive years, according to CoStar.\nSoutheastern hasn\u2019t set rents for its project, at the intersection of Lovett Boulevard and Montrose Boulevard. The options will vary from studios to two-bedroom units, ranging from 550 square feet to 1,600 square feet, with 14,000 square feet of interior amenity spaces and a 20,000-square-foot outdoor courtyard with a pool, garden, event lawn and fire pit.\nThe apartments will turn a\nchapter\non the location while breathing life back into it. The \u201cDisco Kroger\u201d was open 24/7 and earned that nickname from the colorful late-night crowds that would flood the grocery store after closing time for neighborhood bars and clubs. The store was considered a hub of Houston\u2019s Pride celebrations.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "In the course of writing several\nrecent pieces\nabout co-ops, I have learned some interesting things about them.\nThese facts had somehow escaped me despite 56 years of living or covering real estate in New York City, the motherlode of residential co-ops.\nOne that jumped out at me: Co-op unit sales \u2014 which are actually sales of shares \u2014 were not recorded in ACRIS, the city\u2019s property records database, prior to 2003. Sales in HDFC co-ops are exempt from transfer taxes, so they still need not be recorded in ACRIS.\nThis made it difficult for me to investigate the\nbizarre history\nof unit transfers at 123-25 East 102nd Street in East Harlem. Actually, it would have been impossible if not for attorney Gregory Byrnes\u2019 having subpoenaed the co-op\u2019s records, which showed insiders passing units back and forth like baseball cards.\nI asked Adam Plotch, a veteran of co-op foreclosure auctions, how title insurers can verify the chain of ownership if the records are kept not in a public database or municipal office but in the dusty file cabinets of the co-op. The answer was, title companies don\u2019t necessarily rely on public records for co-op deals.\n\u201cAn original stock certificate and proprietary lease is immutable proof of ownership,\u201d he replied. \u201cA co-op will not issue a stock [certificate] and lease to a new owner until the old one is canceled. They also will not allow [them] to be transferred unless their own records reflect that the transferor is, indeed, the sole owner of the shares.\n\u201cSo if you have a stock and lease in your possession, and you couple that with the records of the co-op, it\u2019s as clear a record as any of valid ownership.\u201d\nThe system seems archaic to me. What would happen if fire destroyed a co-op\u2019s records and shareholders\u2019 stock certificates? How would anyone know who owned what?\nBut I don\u2019t want to single out co-ops. Records of real property transfers could also use modernization, as revealed by frequent reports of deed theft and fraud.\n\u201cA nefarious or sloppy owner of real property can, in theory, execute multiple deeds to the same property to multiple persons,\u201d Plotch noted. \u201cThis actually happens \u2014 and there\u2019s statutory and case law that determines how such conflicts are resolved: The first person to record his deed in the land records is deemed to be the owner.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nYiatin Chu and I have had our differences on X, but I couldn\u2019t argue with\nher post\non being a landlord in New York City: \u201cThis is what happened to my relatives. The renter subletted to someone who didn\u2019t pay. The squatter knew how to play the court system to delay. It took 3-yrs to evict. They won\u2019t get the $80k in unpaid rent and the tenant destroyed the place. It cost $70K to gut renovate. Many small property owners fear these situations and rather take their units off the market.\u201d Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\n\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: A Chicago judge is considering ordering tenants relocated from a violation-ridden building. In New York City, tenants aren\u2019t evacuated unless their building presents an imminent danger \u2014 because with the city\u2019s 1.4 percent vacancy rate, there is nowhere for them to go.\nElsewhere\u2026\nAn update on an item I wrote last week about a\nnew state law\nbanning algorithms that allow landlords to collude on rents:\nThe Real Estate Board of New York sent a statement explaining its strident opposition to the bill.\n\u201cAttempting to prevent collusion is laudable, but this legislation goes beyond regulations in other states, to the point of banning evaluation of public data outside of a property owner\u2019s portfolio when considering rents,\u201d said REBNY President Jim Whelan. \u201cWe believe more transparency and market analysis most often benefits the consumer and this bill will lead to unintended consequences like higher rents and reduced market efficiency.\u201d\nThat\u2019s quite a contrast to\nthis tweet\nby Jay Martin of the New York Apartment Association, which represents rent-stabilized owners (and doesn\u2019t always see eye-to-eye with REBNY):\n\u201cWe spent 0 time and energy opposing this bill. Why? We couldn\u2019t find any members that use \u2018algorithms to collude and raise rent.\u2019\u201d\nWith trademark sarcasm, he added, \u201cCongrats though. Eventually we\u2019ll get around to policy solutions that will make housing more affordable.\u201d\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$5.8 million\nfor a 2,500-square-foot condominium at The Caledonia at 450 West 17th Street in Chelsea. Joseph Pullen and Taylor Durland with The Corcoran Group\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$170.3 million\nfor the Dominick Hotel at 246 Spring Street in Soho. The hotel has 46 floors and 391 rooms.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$18.5 million\nfor a 4,689-square-foot condominium at 65 West 13th Street in Greenwich Village. Noble Black, Connor Cuccinelli and Cory Cahlon with The Corcoran Group have the listing.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "Blocking affordable housing is nothing to be proud of \u2014 especially for an affordable building getting public money.\nIt\u2019s certainly not something the state should encourage. But that appears to have happened at Inwood Gardens, a\nMitchell-Lama\nin northern Manhattan.\nShareholders of the co-op at 45 Fairview Avenue voted twice to sell a vacant lot to affordable housing developers for $7.3 million, only to back out. This came shortly after a state affordable housing agency handed the co-op a $2.5 million mortgage from its\nPreventative Troubled Assets Program\n.\nThen this year, the state Assembly awarded Inwood Gardens\n$500,000\n.\n\u201cAt the same time the co-op was rejecting my offer to acquire its land, it was accepting bailouts from the state,\u201d said an exasperated Coconut Properties CEO Adam Zeidel, who partnered with the nonprofit RiseBoro Community Partnership on the proposal.\nInstead of 175 new, affordable apartments for seniors, the neighborhood was left with a garbage-strewn lot. The developers\u2019 six-year effort came to nothing. And taxpayers got stuck with the co-op\u2019s bills.\nIn short, everybody lost.\nCoconut and RiseBoro still hope to build the project, which would sit alongside a similar one they just constructed next door at\n37 Hillside Avenue\n(see photo, above). But the lenders they had lined up to finance the sister project have moved on.\nZeidel had implored the lenders to hang on as he attempted to rescue the deal with increasingly desperate emails to the state Division of Homes and Community Renewal and local elected officials.\n\u201cWe are simply seeking someone to mediate and navigate towards a resolution in which we can (i) give the Co-Op a big chunk of money (capital for present/future needs) and (ii) allows us to build a new, 100% affordable housing project on vacant land that the Co-Op has no use for,\u201d he wrote to a state official. \u201cThis result would benefit all parties.\u201d\nIn one message, the developer warned the state that by giving the co-op money, it was reducing the building\u2019s need to sell the land.\n\n\u201cAny time the Co-Op needs capital, HCR provides it,\u201d Zeidel emailed the agency. \u201cSo, what is the incentive for the Co-Op to make a deal?\u201d\nThe agency told\nThe Real Deal\nthat it has not awarded Inwood Gardens funding \u201crecently\u201d and that Mitchell-Lamas are privately owned and responsible for their operating expenses and maintaining their physical and financial integrity.\nMitchell-Lamas across the state have received\nnearly $500 million\nfrom the Hochul administration. Good fiscal practices are not required to qualify. To the contrary, dire financial circumstances appear to strengthen affordable co-ops\u2019 arguments for state help.\nThe case of Inwood Gardens shows that even when these co-ops make bad financial decisions and block housing that Gov. Kathy Hochul says is desperately needed across the state, they still get public grants to patch budget holes.\nEconomists might call that a moral hazard: The co-ops only get public money if they can show that they need it. Had Inwood Gardens sold its unused land for $7.3 million, it would be able to repair its retaining wall without a handout from taxpayers.\nThe co-op\u2019s shareholders voted overwhelmingly in 2021 to approve the deal, and its board followed suit, but never signed the sales agreement. Zeidel never got an explanation that made sense.\n\u201cEach time we got to putting pen to paper to execute the contract, the Co-Op backed out for some novel, unrelated reason,\u201d he emailed the state in January.\nDavid Baron, head of Inwood Gardens\u2019 property manager at the time, Metro Management Development, told\nThe Real Deal\n, \u201cI cannot speak to the reasons the sale did not go through.\u201d\nThe co-op initially squeezed Coconut and RiseBoro for more money. Two years after voting for the deal, the board asked for 40 percent more cash, plus $100,000 to repair a retaining wall. The developers agreed.\nBut then the board overplayed its hand, raising its price another 30 percent. Realizing the co-op would never get to yes, Coconut and RiseBoro withdrew their offer.\n",

City officials claim the owner has yet to remove ash and debris from the deadly January wildfires. The home was featured in the fourth season of \u201cSuccession\u201d as the luxury estate of the fictional Roy family.\nThe five-member Los Angeles Board of Building and Safety Commissioners said the fire debris at the eight properties, which includes luxury estates, multifamily apartments and businesses, were a public nuisance and could be a risk to public health and safety. Officials say the owners of these properties failed to meet the Oct. 2 deadline to clear hazardous fire debris. With the Oct. 8 vote, owners must either clean up their lots or prepare for a city contractor to do it for them and slap them with a bill.\n\u201cOnce a property is declared a public nuisance, the owner has the right to abate the nuisance until the department solicits bids for the work,\u201d Gail Gaddi, a spokesperson for the L.A. Department of Building and Safety, said. \u201cA process or timeline has not been established for when the department will begin to solicit bids.\u201d\n\nThe six-bedroom, 18-bathroom mansion last sold in 2021 for $83 million. It was\nbuilt in 2020 by developer Ardie Tavangarian\nand is owned by 30-year-old Luminar Technologies founder Austin Russell,\naccording\nto The Daily Mail; in a \u201cSuccession\u201d-like twist, it was once owned by magazine magnate William Randolph Hearst. After the Palisades fire ripped through the neighborhood, the owner withdrew from the\nfederal debris removal program led by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\nout of worry that the government contractors wouldn\u2019t adequately preserve parts of the estate, according to Jon Mansfield, a representative for the owner. After learning that private debris cleanup would cost between $500,000 and $600,000, the owner changed their mind but it was too late to register.\n\u201cThere\u2019s millions of dollars of [building materials] that we were afraid would be destroyed in the process and further degrade the value of the property,\u201d Mansfield said.\nThe \u201cSuccession\u201d house and nearby lots are the latest properties in the Palisades to be declared a public nuisance nine months after the fire. Earlier this month, the Building and Safety Commission declared the 170-unit\nPacific Palisades Bowl Mobile Home Estates\ncommunity a public nuisance. The mobile home park\u2019s owner could similarly see the lots cleaned up and get a bill for the debris removal work.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

After selling out two Highland Park projects with record-setting\npenthouses\n, Fulton Developers is preparing to start construction on a third.\nMark Muller, principal of Fulton Developers, said the firm is seeking final City Council approval for its next project, the Walton, which would feature at least three penthouses priced above $3.7 million, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThat\u2019s the same range where Fulton has already closed six units \u2014 three at Park Sheridan and three more under contract half a mile away at the Wolbright. Rising construction costs could push prices closer to $4 million, Muller told the outlet, though he doesn\u2019t believe it would surpass that.\nThose figures put Highland Park condos in rarefied company, even compared with Chicago\u2019s top neighborhoods. Only a handful of\nGold Coast\nand\nLincoln Park\nunits have sold between $3.7 million and $4 million in the past year, and Fulton\u2019s sales now rival those.\nThe firm\u2019s $3.7 million Park Sheridan closings outpaced nearly all single-family sales in Highland Park during the same period.\nThe five-story Walton, to be located at the 1600 block of Second Street, was approved conditionally by the city council earlier this month, and would rise across from the under-construction Wolbright.\n\nThe site currently holds two houses and a 10-unit resi building. Its redevelopment would continue the corridor\u2019s shift from small-scale residences to luxury condos. The council asked Fulton to refine plans for on-site green space before granting final sign-off.\nWhen complete, the Walton will have 19 units, including multimillion-dollar penthouses and several others expected to top $1 million. Two units will be designated as affordable housing. Fulton aims to start construction in spring 2026.\nThe project marks the developer\u2019s seventh in Highland Park and extends a high-end experiment that\u2019s found surprising traction outside Chicago.\nMuller told Crain\u2019s last year that many affluent\nNorth Shore\nbuyers now prefer local luxury condos over city penthouses, citing concerns about crime and convenience. While other suburbs have struggled to land similar projects, he said Highland Park\u2019s walkable downtown and quiet side streets have made it the right fit for \u201ca penthouse lifestyle without the city.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Firms in the running to redevelop the location include sports businesses and industrial players as well as real estate investors and green tech companies.\nTrammell Crow Company, Pacific Maritime Association, Oakland Roots Sports Club, Industrial Realty Group, GreenCharge Mobility, Glovis America, Deca Companies, Outrigger Industrial and Vistra Corporation are all vying for the job.\nMore than 100 companies expressed interest\nin redeveloping the site, including real estate giants Prologis and Brookfield.\nCBRE-owned Trammell Crow views the\nredevelopment of Howard Terminal\nas an \u201cincredibly significant project for the East Bay,\u201d the company\u2019s Northern California market leader Adam Voelker said.\n\nThe\nOakland Roots Soccer Club\nsubmitted a proposal to build a 25,000-seat soccer stadium at Howard Terminal. The plans call for initially building a temporary structure while the permanent stadium is under construction.\nThe A\u2019s\u2019 certified environmental report could be used by a developer looking to build a sports stadium.

The baseball team was in an\nexclusive negotiation agreement\nwith the port, but it expired in May 2023, leaving a big question mark on the future of the site.\nIt will likely be several more months before the Port of Oakland chooses a finalist for the redevelopment effort. Tariffs, changes in global supply chains and increasing construction costs have already proven to be an obstacle for some, however, with a few proposals becoming financially infeasible and being withdrawn from consideration.\nFor now, Howard Terminal is being used largely for short-term property rental agreements for container parking, depot operations and other maritime uses.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n\\\n",

The 1.8-acre site is next to a senior housing community and a church and about 1,000 feet from an elementary school.\nFour out of seven planning and zoning board members voted against the proposal at a meeting on Monday evening.\nThe property owner wants to build an indoor gun range that will allow private members and\nDelray Beach\npolice officers to train with firearms, said Neil Schiller, Wallace Drive\u2019s attorney.\nThe legislation would also allow the owners of 12 other parcels within the same district (bounded by Southwest Tenth Street, Georgia Street, Southwest Ninth Avenue and Wallace Drive) to pursue plans for a gun range as well. Right now, the light industrial-zoned district includes a CubeSmart self-storage space, two additional warehouses, two single-family homes, and five vacant parcels (three of which are owned by the city).\nSchiller said under the proposed regulations, those property owners would have to submit their own plans to the city commission for final approval. All gun ranges in the district would be required to have 24-hour security, submit to the National Rifle Association\u2019s safety regulations, comply with noise regulations, and ban the sale of alcohol on the premises, he added.\nThe overlay district is adjacent to Groves of Delray II, an apartment community for people over the age of 62, and Calvary Bible Alliance Church.\u00a0 The district is also within 700 feet of Pine Grove Elementary School, board member Mitch Katz said.\nNevertheless, minimum distance requirements from homes and schools were absent from the proposed regulations pushed by Schiller and planning consultant Jeff Costello. Schiller said such details can be worked out during the conditional use process, but city planning staff pointed out that most other municipalities in Palm Beach County had distance requirements for gun ranges.\n\nKatz noted that they just had discussions about distance requirements for vape shops. \u201cBut gun ranges? Well, we can just put them across the street from a school,\u201d he remarked.\nSchiller replied that his client\u2019s building is at least 1,000 feet away from the school.\nThat didn\u2019t make board member Dedrick Straghn feel any less apprehensive about allowing a private gun range near a church and a senior residential community. Straghn also pointed out that gun ranges were already permitted in the city\u2019s mixed industrial and commercial district, where the Delray Shooting Center already operates just a quarter mile away.\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t smell right to me,\u201d Straghn said.\nMark Grafton, another attorney representing the developer, insisted that the range would be a state-of-the art facility that will meet the police department\u2019s needs, including training how to shoot in low-light conditions as well as how to breach doors.\nChairman Gregory Snyder proposed adding regulations that would require a future gun range to be 500 feet from a school, park, or church and that no noise louder than 60 decibels emit past the property line. But when the vote was called just Snyder, Katz and Roger Cope voted yes while board members Straghn, Price Patton, James Chard and Judy Mollica voted no.\nWallace Drive LLC, managed by Delia Lalchan, acquired 1215 Wallace Drive for $5.8 million in March from Aram LLC.\nThe property is about 1.5 miles away from where Kolter Group intends to build\nAlton Delray\n, a 386-unit apartment complex that will include 154 workforce apartments, under the state\u2019s Live Local Act. It\u2019s also less than two miles from\nAura Delray Beach\n, a 292-unit apartment community that an affiliate of New York-based Related Companies acquired for nearly $117 million in August.",

        "content": "Two recent apartment sales in Chicago this month point to the highs and lows of investing in the multifamily market since the pandemic rocked the economy, as local firms sold with disparate results to out-of-state buyers.\nNear the Lakeview neighborhood\u2019s border with Roscoe Village, a 95-unit, two-building complex known as the Low-Line Commons sold for $40 million to Utah-based Highland Partners, notching a solid win for its Chicago-based developers. The deal came out to about $421,000 per unit.\nMeanwhile, Chicago-based Origin Investments didn\u2019t fare as well on its $63 million sale of a West Loop complex to New York-based real estate fund LRE Management.\nTogether, the transactions illustrate the pitfalls of investing even with Chicago climbing the ranks of the nation\u2019s strongest multifamily markets, with a significant lack of new supply driving rents up in a trend poised to continue.\nA Chicago-based venture led by\nMatt Katsaros of Wildwood Investments\nand Michael Breheny of Contemporary Concepts broke ground in 2022 on the four-story Low-Line complex at 3431 North Ashland Avenue, which lines almost an entire block. The team refinanced the property for $27 million in January and less than a year later was able to sell it for well more to Highland.\n\u201cIt took us about just under four years to start and finish, which was our goal, and we sold it at about a 6-cap, which I think fits the current market environment,\u201d Katsaros said, referring to the deal\u2019s capitalization rate of about 6 percent. \u201cIt was a fair deal for us and for the purchasers \u2026 and we\u2019re very happy with the outcome.\u201d\nThe team also developed the adjacent 53-unit Topaz Apartments, which sold to local firm KMA Cos. and Property Management for $17.1 million, or about $322,000 per unit, last year.\nIn the West Loop, Origin sold the 120-unit Monroe Aberdeen apartments for a slight discount from its last purchase price to LRE. The property at 1050 West Monroe Street last traded for $65.8 million in early 2020, when Origin bought it from Michigan Avenue Real Estate Group, a developer backed by\nChicago Bulls and White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf\n.\nFor buildings like Monroe Aberdeen, which last traded at the onset of the pandemic, a sharp rise in interest rates and construction costs have disrupted otherwise strong fundamentals.\nOrigin typically invests in Mountain West and Sun Belt markets, but it\u2019s not walking away entirely from Chicago.\n\u201cOrigin will reinvest sale proceeds in select ground-up development projects in markets where Origin believes supply and demand imbalances create greater opportunities for rent growth and value creation on behalf of its investors,\u201d the firm said in a statement.\n\nSince the pandemic, distressed properties have been on\na wild ride to recovery\nas investor appetite for the market, and Chicago in particular, grows.\n\u201cThe strength of the rental market is the driving force behind these deals,\u201d said Interra Realty broker Joe Samzal, who represented the developers in the Low-Line Commons sale. \u201cIt certainly gives me confidence in what to expect in the next couple of years.\u201d\nHighland, the Low-Line Commons buyer, has spent $150 million on acquisitions throughout the U.S. this year, about half of which are in Chicago and its northern suburbs. That includes another project led by Breheny\u2019s Contemporary Concepts at 516 West Arlington Place in Lincoln Park. That sale came out to $10.3 million, or $739,000 per unit.\nLow-Line Commons\u2019 proximity to the Southport Corridor and mix of one- to three-bedroom units, which is unique for the area, were just two of several factors that piqued Highland\u2019s interest. The firm has offices in Chicago; Tucson, Arizona; and Ogden, Utah.\n\u201cWe love the Chicago market,\u201d Highland Partners co-founder Ben Frazer said. \u201cThe demand side has been great and there\u2019s really been strong employment growth.\u201d\nEven those who were previously hesitant to jump into Cook County\u2019s\nchaotic property tax system\nsay it\u2019s worth the risk now.\n\u201cFrom an underwriting perspective, we are comfortable with the uncertainty with the taxes,\u201d said Eric Londa, founder of LRE Management, the Monroe Aberdeen buyer based in Mamaroneck, New York.\nLRE has deployed about 40 percent of its capital in its fund so far, with a focus on not just Chicago but also Atlanta and Sarasota, Londa said.\nIncreased multifamily investor interest is also translating to an uptick in office-to-residential conversions, either subsidized or unsubsidized.\nWildwood, the seller of Low-Line Commons, recently took over a conversion project in Streeterville that was started by\nHorizon Realty Group\n. Horizon bought the property at 230 East Ohio Street for $5.6 million in late 2024, completed some of the interior work and then sold it to Wildwood for $9.75 million last week.",

The dumpling house is expected to open at The Brook in 2027.\nThe length of the lease at the Witkoff and Apollo Global Management-owned property was not disclosed, nor was the asking rent for the retail space. The average asking rent on retail space in Downtown Brooklyn ranged from $115 to $190 per square foot in the first half of the year, according to the Real Estate Board of New York.\nGoodSpace\u2019s Chris DeCrosta represented ownership on the lease, while Newmark\u2019s Ben Birnbaum represented the tenant.\nKnown for its soup dumplings and noodles, Din Tai Fung boasts more than 180 locations across the world.\nDin Tai Fung began as a cooking oil business founded by a Chinese refugee in 1958 before becoming a steamed dumpling and noodle restaurant in 1972. In 1993, the New York Times praised the restaurant as one of the\n10 best gourmet spots in the world\n. In 2010, its Hong Kong location was awarded a Michelin Star, the first time a Taiwanese restaurant ever earned such a distinction.\n\nIn New York City, it\nleased\n26,400 square feet at 1633 Broadway in Manhattan in 2022 for its first East Coast outpost.\nWitkoff and Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance\nscored a $388.4 million loan\nin the summer of 2022 to build a\n51-story, 591-unit tower\nat 567 Fulton Street.

        "content": "A months-long legal battle between Rok Lending and Miami developer Marlon Gomez over a foreclosed development site in Aventura appears to be nearing an end after a slew of bankruptcy filings and failed last-minute court maneuvers.\nAn affiliate of Aventura-based\nRok Lending\n, led by CEO Bryan Morjain, paid $477,800 for the 1.6-acre property at 21291 Northeast 28th Avenue in a foreclosure auction held Sept. 3, court records show. The purchase followed a $19.9 million judgment the lender secured in February against Gomez\u2019s entity, which allegedly defaulted on a $15 million loan issued in 2023.\nThe Rok Lending affiliate received its certificate of title on Oct. 15, court records show.\nThe sale came after months of procedural delays stemming from Gomez\u2019s efforts to stave off foreclosure by filing two Chapter 11 petitions \u2014 filings that judges have repeatedly described as frivolous and in defiance of court orders.\nGomez hasn\u2019t given up though. His entity filed a notice with the Third District Court of Appeals that it will be filing a petition seeking to reverse the auction and the $19.9 million judgment.\n\u201cDuring this case, we have identified several erroneous factors that we believe will come to light as the appeal progresses,\u201d Gomez stated in an email. \u201cDespite the challenges of today\u2019s market we have financing ready and are actively working to repay the lender to resolve this matter.\u201d\nGomez has run out of time to resolve the debt, Morjain said.\n\n\u201cThe borrower defaulted nearly two years ago and has had ample time to refinance our position or sell the property,\u201d Morjain said. \u201cUnfortunately, none of the proposed take-outs materialized.\u201d\nGomez\u2019s first bankruptcy petition in April postponed a planned April 22 auction of the\nAventura site\n, where he has proposed building a 142,000-square-foot medical office building. In May, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Mark dismissed the case and barred Gomez\u2019s entity from refiling for Chapter 11 protection for 180 days.\nDespite the order, Gomez\u2019s company submitted a second bankruptcy petition just minutes before a rescheduled Aug. 4 foreclosure sale, prompting\nRok Lending\nto seek another dismissal in bankruptcy court, and reinstate the auction in Miami-Dade Circuit Court.\nIn its filings, the lender argued the August bankruptcy petition was void, saying continued delays were causing \u201cimmediate and irreparable damage\u201d since the property was underwater and accruing costs.\nOn Aug. 8, Judge Mark dismissed the second bankruptcy case and issued a stern warning: Gomez, his entity, and their counsel were prohibited from further attempts to delay the foreclosure sale without Rok Lending\u2019s written consent. Days later, Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Abby Cynamon reset the auction for Sept. 3, when the Rok affiliate ultimately emerged as the winning bidder.\nEven after losing the property, Gomez sought to delay the ownership transfer. He requested that Cynamon vacate the foreclosure sale and delay the transfer of title to Rok Lending. She denied both requests \u2014 first on Oct. 7, then again on Oct. 14 \u2014 effectively clearing the way for the lender to take full control of the site.\nThe Aventura site isn\u2019t the only troubled property tied to Gomez. On a separate front, a court-appointed receiver is marketing another distressed asset \u2014 a 1.8-acre Miami River development site \u2014 with an asking price of\n$18.1 million\n. That property, also owned by a Gomez-managed entity, is encumbered by a pending foreclosure lawsuit alleging default on a\n$10 million\nloan.",

Landlord OYO Hotels broke state law by failing to provide the required 90-day notice before the mass terminations, according to the judge.\n\u201cThat\u2019s completely outrageous, actually, to terminate the employees without the notice to which they are entitled,\u201d New York County Supreme Court Judge Andrea Masley said, extending a temporary order.\nThe saga dates back to the beginning of August, when OYO allegedly blindsided property manager Highgate Hotels with a notice canceling its contract, according to a lawsuit filed by Highgate.\nThe cancellation attempt came four years ahead of schedule and included the citation of issues related to an entirely different property Highgate operates.\nThe issue centers on a 10-year management agreement entitling Highgate to a 3.25 percent cut of the 208-key hotel\u2019s gross revenue. OYO is supposed to provide working capital to the property, which Highgate describes as \u201cwell-performing.\u201d OYO begged to differ on Highgate\u2019s performance in the termination notice. The hotel owner said it now plans to welcome a new, unnamed property manager.\n\nThe fight pits one of New York\u2019s biggest management companies against one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing hotel owners.\nHighgate controls more than 30 New York hotels\nand 500 globally. OYO,\nbacked by SoftBank\n, bought Motel 6 from Blackstone last year for $525 million and is preparing an initial public offering that could value the company at $8 billion.\nThe effort to terminate Highgate\u2019s contract could be a means for OYO to cut expenses and boost earnings before the IPO.\nThe judge issued an ominous warning to lawyers from both parties.\n\u201cEventually you\u2019re going to break up.

        "content": "An affiliate California investor group whose tangled West Coast transactions stoked a regional bank stock slide last week also owns a pair of luxury rental buildings on the Upper East Side now at the center of an unusual lawsuit in New York City.\nThe firm, an affiliate of Cantor Group, bought 227 East 67th Street and 184 East 64th Street in 2019 for $38 million. They refinanced the properties with a nearly $20 million loan from Los Angeles-based Preferred Bank in 2023, but a buyer who entered into a 2024 contract to buy the properties claims that the Cantor affiliate refuses to close the deal. Zions Bancorporation and Western Alliance Bancorporation were the two banks whose concerns about Cantor led to the stock drop (and fears of\nbroader failure\n); the Upper East Side buildings\u2019 bizarre financial saga ties in a third regional bank: Preferred Bank.\nQuestions about Cantor emerged last week when Zions Bancorp announced that it was suing two Cantor Group funds along with investors\nGerald Marcil\nand\nAndrew Stupin\nand their associate Deba Shyam for misrepresenting the collateral underlying the bank\u2019s loans.\nWestern Alliance\nrevealed it had a similar lawsuit, alleging a Cantor fund used fake title policies to hide other bank\u2019s claims.\nZions Bancorp provided $60 million in loans to Cantor Group funds which were supposed to be used to purchase distressed mortgage loans. Western Alliance provided $100 million in loans as a revolving credit facility also to purchase mortgage loans.\n(A lawyer for Cantor Group said it upheld all its contractual obligations to Zions Bank and any suggestion to the contrary is a lie. The lawyer said \u201cthere have been multiple audits and independent reviews of these loans at the bank going back years and there have been no monetary defaults.)\nThe news rattled investors who feared the other regional banks would reveal write-downs on troubled loans. It also came in the wake of the bankruptcies of auto parts company First Brands and auto lender Tricolor, which led to losses at major Wall Street banks.\nOn Oct. 16, Zions Bancorp\u2019s shares slid 13 percent, while Western Alliance\u2019s shares fell over 10 percent. The bank\u2019s shares have recovered and are trading around 3 percent below where the banks were prior to the decline.\nThe flip\nMichael D\u2019Alessio owned the Upper East Side buildings at 227 East 67th Street and 184 East 64th Street, but in 2019, a court sentenced him to six years in prison after he pled guilty to defrauding investors out of $58 million in what prosecutors referred to as a \u201cPonzi-like\u201d scheme. His lender, Preferred Bank, initiated a foreclosure and purchased the properties through bankruptcy sale for a combined price of $32.5 million in February 2019.\n\nTwo months later, Preferred Bank flipped the properties to a firm called Continuum Analytics for $38 million and also provided a $29 million loan on the properties. But the deed and loan were signed by Deba Shyam, who described her position as Cantor Group Member LLC\u2019s managing member. (Shyam was named in the lawsuit brought by Zions Bancorp.)\nIn late 2024, Shyam\u2019s Continuum Analytics found a buyer for the two buildings. Two Switzerland-based companies allegedly sought to purchase the Upper East Side pair for $24 million. The new sale was a 36 percent decrease from the price Continuum paid for the properties. The unknown Swiss buyers made a $1.2 million deposit and put the balance in escrow, but Continuum allegedly wanted out of the deal at the last minute.\nThe Switzerland companies filed a lawsuit in New York Supreme Court alleging Continuum failed to honor its purchase and sales agreements. The buyer also sought to appoint a receiver on the properties, alleging Continuum owes more than $460,000 in property taxes on the buildings. The lawsuit is still pending.\nPreferred Bank\nAt the heart of Western Alliance and Zions Bancorp\u2019s lawsuits is the allegation that the borrowers misled the banks about liens or security interests on collateral they believed secured their loans. In the event of a default, Western Alliance and Zions Bank presumed they were getting paid back first.\nBut Western Alliance\u2019s lawsuit alleges Cantor Group\u2019s fund hid other senior liens through bogus title policies. In many cases where Western Alliance presumed to have a senior lien, documents from title companies show the lienholder to be Preferred Bank \u2014\u00a0the lender on the New York properties.\nPreferred Bank, founded in 1991 to serve the Chinese American community in Southern California, was an active lender to Cantor Group. It had the first lien position on at least seven properties, according to Western Alliance\u2019s lawsuit. These include: 2522 South Grove Avenue in Ontario, California, and 28207 Newhall Ranch Road in Valencia, California, according to the lawsuit.\nWestern Alliance alleges the policies provided by Cantor had no reference to Preferred Bank\u2019s first position on the collateral.\nPreferred Bank did not return a request to comment.",

        "content": "A New York mall\u2019s\ncontinued distress\nhas spelled out bad news for investors.\nA loan tied to the Palisades Center mall in Rockland County, New York, has been settled, but with substantial losses to securities holders. Lower classes of the bonds were wiped out entirely, and first-priority investors also saw some of their investment vanish, according to Morningstar Credit. Occupancy and revenue at the mall had declined substantially since the loan\u2019s underwriting in 2016.\nPyramid Management Group developed the mall, located in West Nyack, New York, in the late 1990s. In 2016, the firm secured a $388.5 million refinancing against the property. That was just a fraction of the mall\u2019s value, then estimated at $881 million, according to Morningstar.\nThe loan was securitized and sold to investors. But the mall couldn\u2019t keep up its performance. JCPenney and Lord &amp; Taylor closed their locations there in 2017 and 2019, respectively. Those anchor spaces have never been filled.\nRevenue dipped precipitously during the pandemic and then failed to fully recover. The mall pulled in more than $80.4 million in 2016, but that fell to $61.8 million in 2022, according to Morningstar. Occupancy fell from 100 percent to 78 percent that same year, as the loan was transferred to special servicing for maturity and monetary default. Expenses, once 40 percent of revenue, rose to 60 percent by 2023.\nThe most recent data, from 2024, shows revenue has fallen more than 30 percent, to less than $56 million. At the time, the mall did not have enough revenue to cover its debt service. Current tenants in the four-story, 1.9 million-square-foot property include Home Depot, Target, BJ\u2019s Wholesale, AMC and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods.\n\nThe mall was most recently appraised at $191 million, a loss of 78 percent of its value, according to Morningstar.\nThe servicer\nfiled for foreclosure\nand was granted a receiver and summary judgment in the case.\nThe loan was resolved this month, after taking a $231.4 million loss. Class B, C and D bondholders were entirely wiped out. Class A lost about 32 percent of its value, to the tune of $72 million.\nPyramid Management Group has had a difficult year, beyond the Palisades Center. The company has\nlost two other malls to foreclosure\nin roughly one year: the Aviation Mall in Queensbury, New York and the Hampshire Mall in \u200b\u200bHadley, Massachusetts, according to\nreporting\nfrom Syracuse.com.\nPyramid Management Group did not immediately respond to a request to comment for this story.\n",

        "content": "Prosper Group is partnering with a Belgian developer on a planned $650 million luxury condo tower along the Miami River in Brickell,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nVersluys Group, led by CEO Bart Versluys and COO Peter De Decker, is a joint venture partner with Miami Beach-based Prosper Group, led by Jay Roberts, on the development of the waterfront assemblage at 99 Southwest Seventh Street, 66 Southwest Sixth Street and 625 Southwest First Avenue in Miami, the partners said.\nThe partners plan a 60-story, 158-unit branded high-rise with more than 300 feet of river frontage. The project will mark Versluys\u2019 first U.S. development, De Decker said. Construction will take about 30 months and the building is expected to be completed in 2028, according to a press release.\nThe joint venture is under contract to acquire the development site next spring for an undisclosed price, Roberts said. Sales are expected to launch in the third quarter. Roberts said he was introduced to Versluys through a mutual connection.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of appetite from European investors, and capital looking for opportunities outside of Europe and into South Florida,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cRegulations in Europe are hurting development and growth.\u201d\nDe Decker said the firm has always been interested in investing in Miami.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the high-end residential market in Belgium, Holland. We have a lot of deals in the top 1 percent of the market,\u201d De Decker said. \u201cIf we want to expand, we must look at other markets. We were looking at London, Singapore, Dubai.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Harvey Hernandez\u2019s Newgard Development Group and Two Roads Development\ninked a contract\nto sell a portion of the site to Prosper. It was part of the developers\u2019 three-tower assemblage site, where they are\ncurrently building\nLofty Brickell and the Standard Residences.\nDevelopers have been increasingly joint venturing on new high-rise projects, driven by rising costs.\nThe Prosper-Versluys project is expected to include about 35,000 square feet of food and beverage retail space. The developers declined to name the brand, but plan to announce that at a later date.\nProsper\u2019s portfolio includes more than 1,300 residential units planned or under construction in Tampa and South Florida, according to the release.\nEarlier this year, Prosper and its partner Forte Development\nsubmitted plans\nfor an 80-story mixed-use condo tower also in Brickell, at\n1040 South Miami Avenue\n. Their application was filed under Miami-Dade County\u2019s rapid transit zoning, which can provide developers with additional density. The site is about a block away from the Brickell Metromover station.\n",

        "content": "Millionaire Stephen Cloobeck, who is running for governor of California as a Democrat, knows that throwing money at a challenge doesn\u2019t always work.\nThe time-share entrepreneur saw the 2020 end of his five-month relationship with girlfriend Stefanie Gurzanski get ugly, litigious and public. Cloobeck, 58 when he met the OnlyFans model and Instagram influencer, spent over $1 million on Gurzanski, throwing her a\n$130,000 party\nfor her 26th birthday, buying her a $200,000 Richard Mille watch, and prepaying her annual rent on a luxurious Beverly Hills apartment. He claimed he didn\u2019t know she was shooting porn on his property and posting it on OnlyFans, and said he broke up with her when he found out.\nBut when it comes to his business acumen and wealth \u2014 which Inside Edition put at\naround $100 million\nin 2021 \u2014 Cloobeck is far more successful.\nAnd he\u2019s willing to throw some big money at the long-shot challenge of becoming California\u2019s next governor.\nThe former CEO of Diamond Resorts has\nthe most money in his coffers\namong all 2026 California gubernatorial contenders, raking in $13.6 million via 172 contributions, according to\nCalifornia Secretary of State records\n.\nGranted, he contributed $13 million of the total, but he got some contributions from real estate executives, including $72,800 from\nWilliam Meldman, chairman of Discover Land Company, a Scottsdale, Arizona-headquartered real estate developer and operator of private residential communities and resorts. Cloobeck reeled in another $20,500 from five Discovery Land Company employees.\nCloobeck, who turns 64 on Sunday, also received $51,400 from family-owned real estate investment firm Randall Realty Group, led by\nJames Randall\n, the airplane rivet king-turned-philanthropist, and $36,400 from Jim Murren, former CEO of MGM Resorts International. Residential agent Josh Altman, co-founder of The Altman Brothers at Douglas Elliman, who shot to fame on \u201cMillion Dollar Listing Los Angeles,\u201d shelled out $1,500.\nBeyond real estate, actress and comedian Tiffany Haddish supported Cloobeck with a $2,500 donation, director Brett Ratner gave $1,000 and actor and comedian Tom Arnold contributed $500.\nThe first-time political candidate, who once considered a run for governor of Nevada, announced his bid for California\u2019s top elected office about a year ago but only recently garnered attention atop the money list among candidates.\nHis slogan is \u201cCalifornia, Get a Cloo.\u201d (He is giving away\nmerchandise\n.)\nHe is one of many candidates competing to succeed Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is term-limited and ineligible for reelection in 2026.\nHow he got here\nCloobeck, who started out as a busboy in a small California restaurant, built his first shopping center in the 1980s in Burbank, California, and others in Bakersfield, Hanford, Hemet, Buena Park and Mission Viejo. He built his first hotel, the Polo Towers, on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nHe founded Las Vegas-based Diamond Resorts International in 1992. The company\nacquired\nthe publicly traded Sunterra Corporation in 2007 for $700 million, helping Diamond Resorts to become the second-largest vacation ownership company.\nBy 2016, Diamond Resorts had a network of more than 420 vacation destinations in 35 countries. Cloobeck sold Diamond Resorts to private equity firm Apollo Global Management in a 2016 deal expected to total $2.2 billion.\nCloobeck was named Nevada Athletic Commission chairman for a two-year term in June 2021. He\nresigned\nin late 2022, saying he would not be able to work with Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican who took office in early 2023.\nThe matter seemed more personal than ideological.\n\u201cHe is not honest nor grateful for the great benefits I\u2019ve given to the State of Nevada,\u201d Cloobeck said at the time.\nAs chairman of the Athletic Commission, Cloobeck pressed for the cause of death in the case of Nathan Valencia, 20, who collapsed in the ring after a University of Nevada-Las Vegas fraternity-sponsored boxing match. Cloobeck successfully pushed the commission to pass \u201cNathan\u2019s Law\u201d which requires trained referees and on-site medical personnel at amateur boxing events \u2014 but noted in his resignation that then Clark County Sheriff Lombardo did nothing to help his effort.\nOther past appointments were serving as the inaugural chairman of the board of Brand USA Inc., a United States government-formed nonprofit corporation to promote travel to the U.S.; and a member on Nevada\u2019s Standing Committee on Judicial Ethics and Election Practices, a board that attempts to settle ethical disputes that may arise over the course of campaigns for judicial office.\nA native of the Encino district in the San Fernando Valley, Cloobeck received a degree in bio-psychology from Brandeis University in 1983. He lives in a Beverly Hills mansion. Twice divorced, Cloobeck has three grown children. After his father went bankrupt, Cloobeck supported him until he passed away, per Vanity Fair.\n\u201cThe internet says I\u2019m only worth $100 million, which is just fine with me,\u201d he told\nVanity Fair\nin 2021. \u201cMy house in Beverly Hills is worth $100 million, and I own a $45 million home for cash in Cabo, and I own my own jet. You can do the math yourself.\u201d\nCloobeck appeared on several episodes of the reality-television show \u201cUndercover Boss,\u201d working low-level jobs at Diamond Resorts International to see a different side of the business.\nIn June, the candidate released his second book, \u201cFacing Hard Truths: How Americans Can Get Real, Pull Together, and Turn Our Country Around.\u201d The book covers topics including immigration, crime and the cost of living. His first book, \u201cChecking In: Hospitality-Driven Thinking, Business, and You,\u201d came out in October 2018.\n",

        "content": "A shuttered Skokie school property could soon be redeveloped by a firm with a heavy presence in Chicago\u2019s Fulton Market into a new 68-unit townhome community.\nSkokie\u2019s Plan Commission gave the project its blessing last week under new developer\nFulton Street Companies\n, helmed by Ross Babel and Alex Najem.\nThe local body voted unanimously to recommend approval of the developer\u2019s proposal to build three-story rental townhomes at 4600 Main Street, near Kilpatrick Avenue, the North Shore Record\nreported\n. The 3.9-acre parcel, formerly home to Arie Crown Hebrew Day School, has sat empty since the school consolidated operations at its Gross Point Road campus in April, said board member Brian Levinson.\nThe\nChicago-based\ndeveloper plans 24 two-bedroom and 44 three-bedroom units, each with a two-car garage, plus a total of 158 parking spaces. The project mirrors an earlier plan approved in 2024 for the same site by developer Luz and Associates, which later folded before breaking ground, according to Skokie planning manager Kate Portillo.\nIf approved by the Village Board, which will take up the matter at a future meeting, Fulton Street would buy the property from Arie Crown and move forward with construction.\nThis is the first project Fulton Street picked up outside of Chicago proper, said Babel, a founder and managing principal at Fulton Street. Babel told\nThe Real Deal\nthat closing on the land sale still needs to go through for the project to proceed.\nUnder\nSkokie\u2019s\nInclusionary Housing Ordinance, adopted in May, the developer would normally be required to reserve 5 percent of units \u2014 four in this case \u2014 for affordable housing. Instead, Fulton Street has opted to pay a $450,000 \u201cfee in lieu\u201d to the village, an alternative allowed under the law.\nThat exemption drew pushback from residents during Thursday\u2019s meeting.\n\n\u201cFour hundred thousand dollars is chump change,\u201d said resident Emi Yamauchi, arguing the townhomes fail to expand affordable housing options.\nAnother neighbor, Thomas Whitaker, objected to the project\u2019s density and height, saying it would \u201coverlook two-story homes\u201d and clash with the character of the area. Babel said the only consideration on the fee in lieu of affordable housing units was to mirror the Luz and Associates approval.\n\u201cThis was a deal the village has already seen and was already approved before, so all we\u2019re doing is following in the footsteps of what\u2019s been done and approved before,\u201d Babel said.\nLevinson, who also serves on the village\u2019s Economic Development Commission, countered that the project would help revive Main Street and expand the local tax base.\n\u201cAll of us would love an open park, but the positives this will bring for the greater village far outweigh the negatives,\u201d he said.\nVillage staff also endorsed the plan, citing infrastructure improvements that would boost water pressure and free up nearby street parking. A traffic analysis found the residential project would generate fewer daily trips than the former school use.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The Houston native spent more than five decades building and reshaping the city\u2019s commercial landscape through his firm, which he founded in 1969 with partner Joseph Rambin III.\nRambin\ndied in 2024 at 79, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe two launched their eponymous company with a focus on zero lot-line residential townhomes before pivoting to the office sector, where they left a distinct architectural mark. Through the 1980s and 1990s, the firm delivered a string of signature business parks \u2014 including\nPost Oak Park\n, Town &amp; Country Office Park, Dairy Ashford Place and Northwest Park \u2014 known for their airy atriums and energy-efficient designs, features that helped redefine the look and feel of Houston\u2019s corporate corridors.\nIn the 1990s, Moody Rambin took on a more personal project: redeveloping\nTown &amp; Country Village\n, a 400,000-square-foot retail center originally built by Moody\u2019s father in the late 1960s. The property remains under Moody Rambin\u2019s ownership and management, a rare feat in a city known for its churn-and-burn development cycles.\n\nMoody\u2019s son, Dan Moody III, joined the company during that same decade, helping expand its portfolio into industrial, retail and multifamily projects. Under the younger Moody\u2019s leadership, the firm has grown to more than 100 employees and remains a mainstay in Houston\u2019s development and management circles.\nA graduate of Lamar High School and the University of Texas, Moody was remembered as a civic-minded developer with deep Houston roots. He was a founding member of Scenic Houston, a nonprofit focused on urban beautification, and contributed to the Methodist Hospital Foundation, the Brookwood Community and the Houston Parks Board.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",
