        "content": "Manhattan\u2019s luxury market is officially in a slump.\nThe borough logged another weekly decline in contracts signed for homes asking $4 million or more, according to Olshan Realty\u2019s report. Buyers signed contracts for just 11 luxury properties between Sept. 8 and Sept. 14, down from 15 in the\nprevious period\n.\nThe period followed the usual dip in inked deals around the Labor Day holiday.\u00a0 But in the last four weeks, only 64 homes entered contract, down from 87 during the same period in 2024, and the pending deal values amounted to roughly half of the sales volume recorded last year.\nThe luxury market as a whole is struggling to find its footing, and the trophy market \u2014 defined in the report as homes asking $10 million or more \u2014 is in more dire straits. During the same four-week period, just 11 trophy properties found buyers, compared to 27 a year ago.\nEven the top contract inked this week was under $10 million, a rare occurrence in the borough. The condo at 111 Murray Street last asked $9.2 million, down from $9.5 million when it hit the market in February.\nUnit 45East at the Tribeca building last traded for $6.7 million in 2021. The 2,800-square-foot apartment has three bedrooms and four bathrooms and features a corner great room with views of the Manhattan skyline.\nThe 157-unit building, developed by the Fisher Brothers, Witkoff Group and New Valley ventures, includes amenities such as a fitness center, pool, hammam and landscaped terrace. Earlier this summer, a penthouse at the building asking\n$34 million\nfinally landed a buyer after\n\n10 years on the market.\nCorcoran\u2019s Nick Riback, Patrick Rukai and Reid Lacognata had the listing.\nThe second most expensive property to enter contract was a condo at the Naftali Group\u2019s 255 East 77th Street, with an asking price of $8.5 million. Unit 28B spans 2,900 square feet and has four bedrooms and four bathrooms.\nThe apartment was one of 44 of the building\u2019s 62 units to find buyers since sales launched last October. Amenities in the tower, designed by Robert A.M. Stern, include a garage, fitness center, pool and porte-cochere.\nA team with Compass\u2019 development marketing arm, led by Alexa Lambert, is heading sales at the Lenox Hill property.\nOf the 11 properties, seven were condos, three were co-ops and one was a townhouse.\nThe homes\u2019 combined asking price was $70 million, for an average price of $6.4 million and a median of $5.4 million. The typical home spent nearly 250 days on the market and was discounted 4 percent from the original listing price.\n",

        "content": "The pending sales of a waterfront home in Miami Beach asking $15.3 million, and a condo owned by a Brazilian sugar mogul topped luxury sales activity in Miami-Dade County last week.\nThe deals are two of eight contracts signed between Sept. 8 and Sept. 14, according to the latest\nEklund-Gomes\nreport, which tracks listings of homes and condos asking $4 million and up in\nMiami-Dade\nthat are included in the Multiple Listing Service. The properties spent 121 days on the market, on average.\nForty-two luxury listings were added to the market, for a total of 1,163 listings.\nThe\nprevious week\n, buyers signed contracts for 15 properties in Miami-Dade, asking a combined $114.2 million.\nThe asking dollar volume for the six single-family homes and two condos under contract last week totals $53.4 million, according to the report, which is authored by the Douglas Elliman team led by Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes.\n\nThe single-family homes that entered into contract last week have an average asking price of $7.2 million and spent an average of 128 days on the market. They total $43 million in asking dollar volume.\nThe priciest home to secure a buyer last week is the waterfront\nVenetian Islands\nhome at 315 East Rivo Alto Drive. The 4,387-square-foot, five-bedroom and five-and-a-half bathroom house is asking $15.3 million with Douglas Elliman\u2019s Dina Goldentayer. Joel Lusky of The Brokerage South Florida is representing the buyer. A company managed by Tom Mooser owns the 0.4-acre property in Miami Beach. It previously sold in 2021 for $8 million. Mooser owns La Vaquita Flea Market in Pendergrass, Georgia, according to his LinkedIn.\nThe condos that secured buyers last week have an average asking price of $5.2 million and spent 133 days on the market, on average. They total $10.4 million in asking dollar volume, or an average of $1,410 per square foot.\nThe most expensive condo to enter into contract is a condo at the Bath Club in Miami Beach. Unit 1404 at 5959 Collins Avenue, asking $5.9 million, is on the market with Matias and Christina Alem of BRG International. Property records show a company managed by Marcelo Campos Onetto, vice chairman of the Brazilian sugar conglomerate S\u00e3o Martinho, owns the four-bedroom, four-bathroom condo. The 3,982-square-foot unit\u2019s asking price breaks down to $1,482 per square foot.\nLast week in New York, buyers signed contracts for 11 homes, according to the latest\nOlshan\nreport. Their combined asking price is $70.3 million, and the typical home spent 246 days on the market.\n",

        "content": "Two Mosser Companies affiliates defaulted on loans tied to San Francisco properties.\nEntities led by Mosser CEO\nNeveo Mosser\nreceived notices of default on loans linked to the Hotel North Beach and an apartment building in Nob Hill, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nThe loans originated before the pandemic from Private Bank &amp; Trust Company, which merged with Silicon Valley Bank. First Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Company took over the loan following SVB\u2019s collapse in 2023.\nThe debts include an $11.8 million loan backed by the 159-room Hotel North Beach at 935 Kearny Street and a $14.8 million debt tied to the apartment building at 1499 California Street. The California Street building, rising four stories with 89 units, is reportedly listed for sale at $13 million, or $146,000 per unit.\nIt\u2019s the latest series of loan defaults for San Francisco-based Mosser Companies. Early last year, the firm defaulted on a 2018 loan for $88 million tied to 12 buildings and 459 apartments. A joint venture between The Swig Company and Mosser also defaulted on a $68 million loan tied to five apartment buildings in San Francisco.\n\nLast year, Mosser Companies exited its Financial District headquarters at 220 Montgomery Street after being\nserved an eviction notice\nby landlord Swig. After that, it\nlisted five apartment properties with 173 units\nin Oakland. In 2021, Mosser was sued by tenants in Oakland alleging illegal utility fees and shutoffs and called the landlord a \u201cserial evictor,\u201d the outlet said.\nThe Mosser Companies affiliates have at least 90 days to take care of the default before the lender could serve the firm a notice of potential foreclosure auction. The borrowers could reach a mutual agreement with the lender, including selling the properties to recoup some of the debt.\nMosser owns and operates at least 40 apartment buildings in San Francisco and other properties in Oakland and Los Angeles as of last year. Earlier this summer, a Mosser affiliate\nsold another Nob Hill apartment building\nat 1060 Bush Street for $16.5 million after defaulting on its JPMorgan-issued loan linked to the property.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Nathan Berman is cooking up his next office-to-residential conversion, taking his prodigious spirit to Third Avenue.\nMetro Loft Management filed plans with the Department of Buildings for a residential project at 675 Third Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. It\u2019s a significant sign of progress coming less than six months after Metro Loft\u2019s partner in the project, David Werner Real Estate Investments, acquired the site from the Durst Organization for $100 million.\nThe conversion plans call for a 464-unit building \u2014 more expansive than previous reports of roughly 430 units \u2014 spanning 321,000 square feet, including retail space on the ground floor. The property would be slightly taller than the office building that stood on the site, leaping from 31 to 35 stories.\nDemolition work is underway at the site, but Metro Loft has not provided a concrete timeline on the project. Werner could not be reached for comment by the outlet.\nThe DOB filing was first reported by\nPincusCo\n.\n\nIn April, Ron Eliasaf\u2019s Northwind Group handed Werner\na $90 million loan\nfor the acquisition and predevelopment of 675 Third. The 340,000-square-foot office building was roughly two-thirds occupied at the time of sale.\nBerman\u2019s firm is one of the conversion kings of Manhattan and Werner is a frequent ally in his projects. The two are partners at 235 East 42nd Street, where they are redeveloping the former Pfizer headquarters into 1,500 rental units, representing the largest office-to-residential conversion in New York City.\nThe project ran into a brief stumble last month when\nsmoke\nbillowed out of the construction site, briefly sidelining workers. Metro Loft said there was no actual fire, but the New York Fire Department did respond to the scene.\nConstruction is expected to wrap the last quarter of 2027. The property, which will feature a mix of luxury rentals and affordable housing through the 467m tax abatement program, will include more than 100,000 square feet of amenities and 30,000 square feet of retail space.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The sale\nclosed\nlast week and deeds became public on Friday.\nThe deal breaks down to $419,886 per key.\nEast Miami is within the Brickell City Centre mixed-use complex that Miami-based Swire Properties completed in 2016. The complex, which spans about five city blocks, also has about 500,000 square feet of retail; the 43-story Reach and Rise condo buildings; and a pair of office buildings.\nEast Miami is home to rooftop venue Sugar and has 89 serviced apartments.\nTrinity and Certares bought the hotel from Swire in 2021 for $174 million. The price recorded in the deed for that deal was $120.3 million. Deeds generally reflect the price of the real estate and exclude furniture and fixtures, which usually are purchased with hotels.\nThe true price of the most recent East Miami sale also could be more than the $147.8 million recorded in the deed if furniture and fixtures were to be included.\n\nBlackstone, an alternative asset management giant led by CEO Stephen A. Schwarzman, had about $1.2 trillion in assets under management at the end of the second quarter, according to its website.\nIt\u2019s been active in South Florida recently. This summer, Blackstone and its industrial arm, Link Logistics, sold a 43.7-acre development site for offices and warehouses at 12691 Northwest LeJeune Road in Opa-locka for\n$105.7 million\n. The deal brought the sellers\u2019 South Florida sales since November to more than $1 billion.\nBlackstone paid\n$115.9 million\nfor the 359-unit Solea at Miami Lakes apartment complex at 17405 Northwest 94th Court in Miami Lakes in April, and also provided a\n$300 million\nloan in May for Karim Alibhai\u2019s Gencom and Edgardo DeFortuna\u2019s Fortune International Group\u2019s renovation of the Ritz-Carlton Key Biscayne at 455 Grand Bay Drive, and planned renovation of the Grand Bay Club at 425 Grand Bay Drive in Key Biscayne.\nBrickell\nemerged as the epicenter of South Florida\u2019s real estate boom, attracting many new-to-market firms expanding to the tri-county region as well as condo developments.\nThe East Miami trade marks the latest sale of a portion of\nBrickell City Centre\n.\nIn June, Swire sold its 75 percent stake in the retail and parking portion at the complex to Simon Property Group for\n$512 million\n. After canceling a planned office supertall on a 2.8-acre Brickell City Centre development site, Swire sold the property to Melo Group for\n$200 million\nin May.\nAlso, Dubai-based hospitality firm Kerzner International paid\n$45 million\nfor a nearly 1-acre development site at 9 Southeast Sixth Street at Brickell City Centre last month. The site is proposed for 350 condos and 180 hotel keys. Kerzner hasn\u2019t revealed its planned project.\n",

        "content": "Dallas is turning to the courts to secure a key piece of land for its $3.5 billion convention center redevelopment.\nCity attorneys filed a condemnation lawsuit this week against Charter DMN Holdings, a firm controlled by developer\nRay Washburne\n, after failed negotiations over a 36,000-square-foot parcel near Young and Houston streets, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. The site sits next to the former Dallas Morning News headquarters at 508 Young Street, which the city purchased from Washburne\nearlier\nthis summer for $45.1 million.\nWashburne told the outlet that he\u2019s willing to sell but\nnoted\nthat a long-term ground lease with broadcaster WFAA complicates matters.\nThe disputed lot is a smaller, adjacent parcel, now a parking lot between the newspaper\u2019s former garage and WFAA\u2019s studio. The city council previously authorized up to $6.5 million to purchase it. That April resolution also cleared the way for eminent domain if a deal couldn\u2019t be reached, laying the groundwork for this week\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe city\u2019s $3 billion convention center overhaul, slated to open in 2029, requires more land to accommodate the Texas Department of Transportation\u2019s planned widening of Interstate 30, rail line upgrades and design changes to avoid building over active tracks. Officials last year identified the Dallas Morning News property as essential to fitting the project into downtown\u2019s tight footprint.\nThe city often uses eminent domain for small parcels that don\u2019t make headlines, such as for easements, but it\u2019s less common in high-profile cases.\nWashburne\n, who bought the campus for $28 million in 2019, retained the site\u2019s frontage even after selling the main tract to the city. Earlier this year, he publicly\nfloated\na sale to a data firm, citing frustrations with delays in the city\u2019s planning and prompting the city\u2019s $45.1 million purchase of the property. The city took control of it in June.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The previous week saw\n15 contracts\n\u201410 condos and five houses \u2014 with a total asking volume of $41 million.\u00a0 During the same week last year, just nine luxury contracts were signed in the borough for $27 million.\nThe top contract last week went to Unit 4F at 1 Grand Army Plaza in Prospect Heights..\nThe four-bedroom, three-bathroom unit spans 3,200 square feet and came on the market in March, asking $5.75 million, before dropping the price. The seller bought the unit for $2.5 million in 2009, according to public records.\nThe 34-foot-wide great room opens up onto a balcony overlooking Prospect Park. The primary suite features a walk-in closet and en-suite bathroom with a soaking spa tub, marble-tiled shower and radiant heated flooring.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Karen Heyman and Alan Heyman had the listing. Compass\u2019 Todd Lewin of the Lewin Rubin team brought the buyer.\nThe 15-story, 99-unit building designed by Richard Meier has a full-service staff, bike storage and parking. It also comes with a shared roof terrace with an outdoor kitchen and grills, billiards room and residents\u2019 lounge.\nThe property previously snagged a top contract last year, when Brooks Brothers CEO Ken Ohashi purchased a penthouse unit in the\nbuilding for $9.45 million\n.\nThe second priciest deal last week went to a combined condo unit at 360 Furman Street in Brooklyn Heights asking $4.5 million.\n\nThe seller purchased Unit 321 in 2012 for $1.2 million before adding Unit 320 in 2018 for $1.9 million. They listed the combined offering for $4.75 million in April before dropping the price to $4.5 million in July.\nThe 2,790-square-foot home comes with four bedrooms, three full bathrooms and a private terrace spanning over 900 square feet.\nThe living space has 13-foot ceilings and hardwood floors, and the eat-in kitchen has floor-to-ceiling custom cabinetry. The four bedrooms, on the north side of the apartment, are separated by a pocket door and each face the terrace.\nThe primary suite has a walk-in closet and spa bath with a separate soaking tub and shower.\nCompass\u2019 Katherine Camp and Eric Schwarzkopf had the listing.\nThe 12-story building, known as One Brooklyn Bridge Park, was converted from a 1928-built warehouse to condos in 2008. The building comes with a 24-hour doorman, a 3,000-square-foot fitness center, a yoga studio, parking garage, billiards room, golf simulator and movie theater.\nCombining units at the building has been a popular undertaking.\nIn 2022, hedge fund executive Stuart Leaf sold a 5,040-square-foot apartment that combined\ntwo duplexes for $7.9 million\nin the building. Leaf had previously combined three units at One Brooklyn Bridge Park on the 10th, 11th and 12th floors and listed the mega-spread for a\nrecord-seeking $32 million in 2015\n.\nIn 2022, another seller combined two units, 427 and 428,\nselling them for $4.1 million\n.\nHomes in the borough entering contract last week had an average price per square foot of $1,614 and a median asking price of $2.7 million.\n",

Other tenants include REI, Bonefish Grill, Sephora, Chick-fil-A, and Homesense.\nThe purchase also included a 77,475-square-foot parking garage at 9536 Glades Road.\nThe deal breaks down to $519 a square foot for the retail building and the garage, which were completed in 2020 along with an adjacent 456-unit apartment complex, The Residences at Uptown Boca.\nA JLL team led by Danny Finkle and Jorge Portela brokered the transaction.\n\nThe seller, a partnership between Giles Capital Group, Rosemurgy Properties, Schmier Property Group and Wheelock Street Capital, developed Uptown Boca, a 38-acre mixed-use project, with a\n$125 million\nconstruction loan. The developers bought the site for\n$38 million\nin 2018, records show.\nIn 2021, the joint venture sold The Residences at Uptown Boca for\n$230 million\nto Atlanta-based Cortland.\nStockbridge\u2019s acquisition of Uptown Boca\u2019s retail component comes 10 months after the firm and its partner, Lacera, sold Fountains of Miramar in Broward County for\n$42.3 million\nto Sunny Isles Beach-based RK Centers. The shopping center is anchored by a Home Depot store, and also features big box tenants Marshalls, HomeGoods, Ross Dress for Less and Pet Supermarket.\nFounded in 2003, Stockbridge owns 20,000 multifamily units and 93.2 million square feet of commercial space across the U.S. worth $36.5 billion, according to the firm\u2019s website. Recently, Stockbridge sold a 230-unit apartment complex in San Jose, California, for\n$97.6 million\n, roughly $6.3 million below the firm\u2019s purchase price in 2019.\u00a0In other recent shopping center deals, Todd Nepola\u2019s Hollywood-based investment and brokerage firm Current Capital Group bought a Miami Gardens retail facility on 15-plus acres.

        "content": "Kilroy Realty Corporation is\nopening up its options\nto kick off its stalled redevelopment of the San Francisco Flower Market site.\nThe Los Angeles-based firm filed an application with the city of San Francisco to tweak its design for its mixed-use project at Sixth and Brannan Streets in Central South of Market, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n.\nThe firm was approved in 2019 to construct office buildings at the site spanning 2 million square feet. In its new application, Kilroy floated several new variants of its approved plan, all of which remove a 22,000-square-foot child care facility and about 1,000 square feet of community space that were part of the original project. The amount of parking on site and the height of the proposed buildings, however, have increased.\nIn one version of the modified project, Kilroy proposed constructing five buildings with roughly 2.6 million square feet of office or lab space, up to 100,000 square feet of retail space, 300,000 square feet of institutional space and more than 800 parking spots. In this iteration, the buildings would range from 11 to 18 stories tall.\nAnother version of the project would utilize the\nstate density bonus law\nto build seven buildings containing a total of 3,532 new homes; each structure would rise a maximum height of 500 feet, or up to 49 stories. That version would also include 100,000 square feet of retail space and more than 1,800 parking spaces.\n\nAnother version, the \u201cMixed-Use Variant,\u201d would have 1,242 housing units as well as 1.5 million square feet of office or lab space, 100,000 square feet of commercial space and more than 1,000 parking spaces. They would be housed across five buildings reaching as high as 480 feet, or 47 stories.\nThe \u201cInstitutional Variant,\u201d meanwhile, proposes building roughly 1.4 million square feet of medical or institutional space, 1.2 million square feet for office and lab tenants, plus 100,000 square feet of retail and 431 parking spaces across five buildings that would top out at a maximum of 270 feet, or 18 stories.\nThe city of San Francisco faces a\nstubborn office vacancy rate\nand desperate need for housing.\nThe old San Francisco Flower Market has since\nrelocated\nto a 125,000 square feet at 901 16th Street in Potrero Hill and opened to customers earlier this year.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The deal for the nine-story, 41,000-square-foot building breaks down to $1,207 per square foot.\nThe property features 21 loft-style residences, as well as 4,000 square feet of retail space. The retail tenant roster includes an outpost of the popular Van Leeuwen Ice Cream chain.\nGlosslab, a membership-based manicure and pedicure company, was once a retail tenant at the property. But ownership sued Glosslab for more than $100,000 in unpaid rent and evicted it from the building in July 2024, according to court records.\nJLL represented both sides of the sale transaction.\nAcadia and Winnhaven Group acquired the property in 2012 for $32.5 million. Acadia had a 24.5 percent stake in the joint venture, according to an annual report from last year.\n\nNearly a decade ago, Acadia\nfiled an offering plan\nfor a condominium conversion of the property, once known as the Empire State Building. The plan called for a $135.5 million sellout, an average of about $6.5 million per unit.\nElsewhere in the city, Acadia has been on a buying tear, snapping retail properties in Soho and Williamsburg. Since last fall, the real estate investment has acquired more than $280 million in New York City property alone.\nBased in Munich, Pamera opened its first office stateside a little less than a year ago, planning to target properties in the Big Apple, Boston and the Sun Belt, according to PERE News.\nSince then, the firm has launched its efforts with a $30 million acquisition of a luxury residential property on Crosby Street, as well as deals on the Upper East Side, Denver and Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The garden level features a sunken den with a gas fireplace, an open kitchen with an 18-foot marble island and direct garden access. A second gas fireplace is in the parlor-level living room, and an open library with glass walls looks out to the backyard.\nThe third-floor primary suite has a walk-in dressing room, private terrace and en-suite bathroom.

He specializes in investments in European markets. His father owned a marine equipment distributor and was president of the Dutch National Marine Association. Nina Taselaar is a licensed clinical social worker, according to her LinkedIn.\n\nThe couple bought the Dunbar Road mansion for $8.5 million in 2014, property records show. When it sold that year, the house had\n$35 million worth of IRS liens\nagainst it. Built on half an acre in 2009, the 8,300-square-foot home includes six bedrooms, seven bathrooms, two half-bathrooms and a pool, according to records.

Last year, designer Tommy Hilfiger sold the lakefront home at 313 Dunbar Road for\n$28 million\n.\nThe Tasekaars\u2019 off-market deal marks the latest pricey\nPalm Beach\nsale, as the island revs up for the busy season. Earlier this month, ex-Apple CEO John Sculley and his wife, Diane Sculley, sold their oceanfront Palm Beach estate for\n$37 million\n.

        "content": "Hot on the heels of California\u2019s CEQA overhaul, state lawmakers are clearing the way for even more housing construction.\nSenate Bill 79, the landmark housing proposal that overrides local zoning laws to increase high-density housing near transit hubs, passed in the state legislature hours before the 2025 legislative session concluded, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n.\nThe bill, introduced by San Francisco state Sen. Scott Wiener, allows for the construction of up to nine stories for buildings adjacent to certain bus stops and train stations, seven stories for buildings within a quarter-mile of the stops and six stories for buildings within a half-mile. It would also subject single-family neighborhoods within a half-mile of transit stops to the new zoning rules.\nThe zoning height limits are tier-based according to the type of transit offered at each hub. Tier 1 zoning includes heavy rail lines such as the L.A. Metro\u2019s B and D subway lines and permits buildings from six to nine stories, depending on proximity to the stations. Tier 2 zoning includes bus routes with dedicated lanes and light rail lines such as Los Angeles\u2019 A, C, E and K lines with the possibility of building between five and eight stories.\n\u201cOver the last five years, housing affordability and homelessness have consistently been among the top priorities in California. The smartest place to build new housing is within existing communities, near the state\u2019s major transit investments that connect people to jobs, schools and essential services,\u201d state Assemblymember Sharon Quirk-Silva said in support of the bill.\n\nThe state is rushing to meet a housing crisis that has gripped the Golden State for years.\nIn July, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law Assembly Bill 130 and Senate Bill 131, which increase environmental review exemptions for infill housing, removing hurdles for developers. AB 130 exempts housing-rich infill developments smaller than 20 acres or builder\u2019s remedy projects under 5 acres from CEQA analysis, while Senate Bill 131 protects any rezoning required by a municipality\u2019s Housing Element from CEQA analysis.\nSB 79 faced pushback from the Los Angeles City Council, which voted to oppose the bill last month. Bill co-author Traci Park called it a \u201cone-size-fits-all mandate from Sacramento.\u201d The resolution called for L.A. to be exempt from the state-mandated upzoning as it already has a state-approved housing plan. Mayor Karen Bass joined the chorus of local officials opposing SB 79.\nThe bill heads to Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s desk next month. California overall must plan to build more than 2.5 million new homes by the turn of the next decade,\naccording\nto its Statewide Housing Plan.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Another vintage Loop office tower is trading desks for beds: the 1928 Millinery Mart Building.\nA joint venture of Acres Commercial Realty and Chicago-based Mavrek Development secured more than $90 million to convert the 24-story building at 65 East Wacker Place into 252 apartments. The package includes a $62.4 million senior construction loan from Derby Lane Partners, an $11 million loan from Hoyne Savings Bank and more than $17 million in state and federal historic preservation tax credits, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe redevelopment is slated to be delivered next spring, according to the project\u2019s website. It joins several\nother\noffice-to-residential conversions in the Loop, including city-backed efforts along LaSalle Street, as landlords face high office vacancies.\nBuilt in 1928 as the Millinery Mart Building, the brick and limestone tower later housed Esquire magazine for the publication\u2019s first couple of decades and is home to Morton\u2019s The Steakhouse, which will stay on the ground floor.\nThe building\nchanged\nhands several times in recent years: Rochester-based Intersection Realty bought it from an Acres venture in 2022, then gave it back through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure last year. Acres then\nteamed\nwith Mavrek to pursue the conversion, winning Chicago City Council approval last December.\n\nWith\npermits now in hand\n, the development team can begin to start interior work. The finished product will feature 105 studios, 105 one-bedrooms and 42 two-bedrooms with in-unit workspaces, plus amenities like a co-working lounge, gym and rooftop terrace. According to Mavrek\u2019s website, the third floor will house most of the amenities. Fifty-one units \u2014 about 20 percent \u2014 will be affordable, priced at an average of 60 percent of the area median income. There will be no on-site parking. The project was designed by Pappageorge Haymes Partners.\nThe timing comes as downtown\u2019s construction pipeline is all but frozen, with little relief expected until 2027. That scarcity has bolstered landlords\u2019 leverage, pushing median Class A net rents up 6.4 percent year-over-year in the second quarter, according to Integra Realty Resources.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

It was appraised at $1.2 billion in 2016.\nThe 1.5 million square foot mall at 865 Market Street is two, nine-story buildings that connect. It is the city\u2019s largest shopping mall, and is now only 7 percent occupied after\nretailers\nsuch as Nordstrom, Bloomingdale\u2019s, Zara, Steve Madden and Kate Space\nmade exits\n. Bloomingdale\u2019s was its last anchor tenant, occupying 340,000 square feet of space, and it closed shop earlier this year even though the company\u2019s lease wasn\u2019t set to expire until 2046, per Morningstar data.\n\nUnibail-Rodamco-Westfield and Brookfield Properties stopped making payments on a $558 million note a couple years ago; total exposure is $626 million now. The latest servicer commentary notes that the lender is in negotiations with the ground lessor over a ground lease default \u2014 and that the lender intends to foreclose as soon as possible.\n\u201cUpon foreclosure, Lender will immediately market for disposition,\u201d the special servicer commentary, via Morningstar, reads.\nA notice of trustee\u2019s sale was recorded in October last year.\nThe mall\u2019s\nforeclosure auction\nhas been delayed several times but now appears to be an \u201cimminent outcome,\u201d according to Morningstar. The property\u2019s operating losses are continuing at about $4.6 million for the first six months of the year. The mall made about $57 million when its current loan was underwritten in 2016.\n",

        "content": "Adam Hochfelder is facing a new issue in New York, this time courtesy of the state tax department.\nThe former Nassau County developer was named New York\u2019s top delinquent taxpayer with more than $48 million in unpaid personal income taxes, according to\nNewsday\n.\nThe onetime \u201cWharton Whiz Kid,\u201d who once controlled a slice of Manhattan\u2019s skyline, holds the dubious distinction of leading the state\u2019s \u201cTop 100\u201d list of individual tax scofflaws.\nThe ranking, published periodically by the state Department of Taxation and Finance, highlights taxpayers with active warrants, the legal lever that allows authorities to seize property, withhold income and block big-ticket purchases, including real estate.\nIn a statement from Hochfelder\u2019s counsel to\nThe Real Deal\n, his lawyers disputed the underlying taxes allegedly owed to the state, claiming former partner Anthony Westreich issued him an improper K-1 tied to the sale of 1440 Broadway more than a decade ago.\n\u201cIn 2013 when 1440 Broadway was sold, Mr. Westreich issued an erroneous K-1 to Mr. Hochfelder improperly allocating $50 million in profits to Hochfelder, nine years after Hochfelder had sold his interest in 1440 Broadway to Westreich in 2004,\u201d the statement read. Hochfelder, per his lawyer, was only a 1 percent partner in the property after he sold his interest.\n\u201cHochfelder\u2019s counsel has been working with NY State to get Hochfelder\u2019s 2013 tax allocation corrected.\u201d\n\nHochfelder\u2019s tax woes are the latest entry in a career defined by difficulties.\nHe was convicted in 2008 of duping family and friends into lending him $17 million, supposedly for resort investments and later served two years in prison after stealing another $2.5 million. In 2019, he\npleaded guilty again\nto a misdemeanor charge stemming from the older fraud case.\nHe\u2019s far from alone on the delinquent roll call. More than 20 Long Island taxpayers cracked the top 100 this summer; Nassau residents owed a combined $68 million.\nAmong them: restaurateur Zvi Yosef, who owes nearly $3 million tied to his shuttered kosher barbecue spot Chimichurri, and George and Tassos Strifas, operators of East Meadow\u2019s Colony Diner, who also owe close to $3 million in sales tax and previously settled wage theft and harassment claims.\nState officials frame the list as both a warning and an equalizer.\n\u201cThis list is about transparency and fairness,\u201d a Tax Department spokesman told Newsday, arguing that enforcement protects compliant taxpayers from being undercut by those who flout obligations. Still, the agency acknowledges the overall sums are small compared with Albany\u2019s multibillion-dollar budget.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Houses of that value rarely hit the public market at all in Lake Geneva, where sellers often opt for exclusivity and sell their multimillion-dollar mansions among private brokers.\nTwo lakefront mansions\nlisted by Compass\u2019s Bob Webster\n\u2014 at $8.7 million and $9.8 million \u2014 got contingent offers just three days after hitting the market in early September following a short period listed as \u201ccoming soon.\u201d\nGina Nocek, an @properties broker who is representing the sellers at 837 Bayview Drive, said Webster\u2019s success motivated her clients to use the same marketing strategy and use a delayed listing in the Milwaukee-area\u2019s METRO MLS. The listing alerts other brokers that the house is about to hit the market, and it shows up on some listing services before officially going public.\nNocek said she and her clients think they can fetch a higher price by getting more eyes on the property rather than pursuing a pocket listing. The asking price is $1,135 per square foot.\n\u201cWe felt that we have a better chance of actually driving up the price rather than selling internally,\u201d she said. \u201cI know a lot of Realtors do that, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a benefit to the sellers. Why not put it on the market and get more exposure?\u201d\nThe five-bedroom, five-and-a-half bathroom house was built in 2018, Nocek said. It sits on a half-acre lot on the Northeast end of Geneva Lake and has two canopied piers.\nThe listing will go public on Sept. 19, Nocek said, and showings will begin Sept. 20.\n\nNocek declined to identify the property\u2019s sellers, but she said they are relocating to Florida. Property tax bills are addressed to a trust under the name Peggy Roth.\nThe string of properties using \u201ccoming soon\u201d listings is unique for Geneva Lake,\nwhere private listings\nand\noff-market sales\nare common. Of the handful of lakefront homes that sold this year for more than $5 million, just one was listed on the public market, according to listing services.\nReal Estate prices on Geneva Lake have been growing in the last few years as inventory has shrunk and demand for second homes has risen. Homeowners are reluctant to sell their valuable lakefront property, so competition can be fierce when listings go public.\n\u201cTwenty years ago, I used to see 25 lakefront listings. Now we\u2019re lucky if we see five a year,\u201d Nocek said. \u201cI think since COVID, people are not selling them as much as they used to. And that\u2019s what\u2019s creating the increase in price.\u201d\nWebster, who listed two lakefront properties in August using delayed listings, said the process went well for his sellers. Both properties had several showings booked in the first two days of going public, and they got contingent offers within three days. Webster said the properties are under contract and expected to close in mid-October.\nWebster described the delayed public listing as an alternative to office exclusive listings, which Compass has been pursuing with its three-phased marketing approach that begins with an internal private exclusive listing. The delayed public listings can give sellers a broader reach than private listings, while giving the property time to generate interest before hitting the market, Webster said.\n\u201cWe were very successful in getting what I think was the best price and terms for the seller we could, and also at the same time giving all the real estate agents in the realtor community a fair shot at showing it and selling it if they had a prospective buyer,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so I think it was a win-win all the way around.\u201d\n",

        "content": "St. Charles is preparing to bring order \u2014 and revenue \u2014 to its Wild West short-term rental market.\nCity officials this week outlined a plan to regulate and tax Airbnbs, Vrbos and other short-term rentals, which currently operate without oversight or city revenue collection, in the suburb roughly 45 miles west of downtown Chicago, the Daily Herald\nreported\n. The move follows growing concern about the impact of rentals on neighbors and the lack of enforcement tools.\nMayor Clint Hull said any standards must be enforceable, with clear authority to revoke or deny registrations if operators fail to comply.\nCommunity Development Director Russel Colby pitched a registration program run through the city\u2019s website, requiring hosts to disclose property details, ownership information and manager contacts. Operators would also agree to abide by occupancy limits, parking rules ans noise and trash regulations. Violators could face suspension, revocation or denial of renewal.\nWhile staff have not\u00a0 proposed a registration fee, fines would be levied against unregistered hosts, escalating with repeat offenses. The city also plans to tap AirDNA, a third-party analytics firm, to track operators and calculate expected tax revenue.\n\nCity staff estimate more than $70,000 in tax revenue went uncollected last year. Under the proposal, short-term rentals would be subject to the same hotel tax as local lodging operators: 6 percent of 94 percent of gross rental revenue. Currently, the tax is self-reported and largely unenforced, leaving the city blind to the scope of the market.\nOfficials said they identified 47 active short-term rentals in St. Charles, with 44 listed on Airbnb and the rest on Vrbo. With demand for alternative accommodations still strong post-pandemic, more properties could surface once the city builds a formal tracking system. Enforcement measures and bans have been\nconsidered\nin\nlocales\nacross the country since short-term rentals\u2019 pandemic\nboom\n.\nElsewhere in the Chicago area lawmakers have addressed issues with short-term rentals. Highland Park\nblocked\na timeshare plan for \u201cfractional ownership\u201d of Michael Jordan\u2019s former estate, and Chicago aldermen squabbled over whether to\nlower\nthe threshold of ward-wide bans on short-term rentals if enough residents sign a petition.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Paramount Group CEO Albert Behler\u2019s past business deals with a Paramount board member adds to the growing number of questions about the office landlord\u2019s decision-making and the independence of its board.\nBehler provided loans and invested in a failed company led by Mark Patterson, a member of the REIT\u2019s board of directors, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings reviewed by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe revelation comes as Paramount and its embattled CEO continue to\nmake headlines\nover shareholder and corporate governance concerns.\nEarlier this year, Paramount said it made millions of dollars in previously undisclosed payments to Behler\u2019s companies. In July, Paramount\ndisclosed it was\nunder a SEC investigation. And\nThe Real Deal\nrecently discovered that Behler personally pushed for a no-bid contract to a security company where his ex-girlfriend, 30 years his junior, was a senior manager.\nNow,\nTRD\nfound that Behler \u2014 who currently serves as chairman of the board \u2014 had extensive past business dealings with Mark Patterson, an independent board member who once chaired Paramount\u2019s nominating and corporate governance committee.\nTRD\nalso found that Patterson faced similar allegations about his objectivity and independence while serving on another board.\nAbout a decade ago, Behler agreed to provide at least two loans to Boomerang Systems, a robotic garage company led by Patterson, as it neared bankruptcy. It is unclear whether the debt was ultimately paid back based on a review of bankruptcy and SEC filings.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a good look, whether in fact he\u2019s compromised or not; the optics are bad,\u201d said Charles Elson, the founding director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.\nParamount declined to comment. Patterson did not return a request to comment.\nIndependent board of directors are supposed to provide an added level of objective oversight for publicly traded companies. But the company\u2019s disclosures around millions of dollars heading to Behler\u2019s personal business, along with his high compensation relative to the stock\u2019s performance, raise questions about whether the board is acting in shareholder\u2019s interest or Behler\u2019s.\nThis comes at a critical time. Paramount is in the midst of\nselling the company\nas its stock hovers around $7 per share.\nBoomerang\u2019s bankruptcy and Patterson\u2019s undisclosed ties\nParamount and Behler\u2019s ties to Patterson go back years.\nPatterson, who was formerly a managing director of Merrill Lynch, became the\nCEO\nof Boomerang Systems in 2010. The company built a new technology that essentially created an automatic valet system where parked cars would slide to drivers on concrete slabs, no human operators needed.\nIn 2012, Boomerang\nannounced\nthat Paramount would use Boomerang\u2019s technology for a 256-space garage in an unnamed multifamily project on the West Coast. At that time, Boomerang\u2019s system was only installed in three properties, and Paramount\u2019s project would have been by far its largest.\n\u201cHaving an accomplished and experienced real estate firm like Paramount Group select Boomerang provides great affirmation of our value proposition of enhancing developer\u2019s margins,\u201d said Patterson in a release at the time.\nBoomerang said its robotic car garage would expedite the construction timeline and improve the \u201ceconomics of the project.\u201d But Boomerang ran into one disaster after the next across its projects. In Miami\u2019s Brickell neighborhood, a condo project using Boomerang left residents waiting hours to get their cars.\nBehler was a major investor in Boomerang, according to SEC filings, and participated in offerings for convertible notes, a type of debt that can be converted into equity such as stock.\nBehler also contributed to efforts to keep the company afloat. By late 2014, Behler joined other investors and committed up to $400,000 as an \u201caffiliate\u201d lender. Behler ultimately loaned the $400,000 and controlled over 5 percent of the common stock of Boomerang, owning over 1 million shares, according to an SEC filing as of June 2015.\nBut Boomerang filed for bankruptcy in August 2015 and Patterson, also a major stockholder in the company, stepped down as CEO.\nIn 2016, a bankruptcy judge approved the sale of the company\u2019s assets to an existing lender for $2.5 million. Equity holders in the company were wiped out through bankruptcy. (The case officially closed in 2020.)\nBehler was not listed as a creditor in Boomerang\u2019s bankruptcy petition and it is unclear whether his loans were ever repaid.\n\nIn May 2018, Patterson joined Paramount\u2019s board.\nPatterson chaired Paramount\u2019s nominating and corporate governance committee. He also served as the lead independent director, a role where Patterson acted as a liaison between Behler, the chairman of Paramount\u2019s board, and the other independent board members.\nParamount never disclosed Behler\u2019s past ties to Boomerang in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or its proxy statement.\nStock exchanges set the rules for independent directors, but corporate governance experts say it\u2019s not unusual for board members and CEOs to have friendly relationships.\nAnn Lipton, a business law professor at the University of Colorado\u2019s law school, described the standards for independence as \u201cvery loose.\u201d\nBut Behler\u2019s investment and possible debt to Patterson\u2018s former company raise questions about Paramount\u2019s motivation for keeping Patterson on the board.\nIn 2021, Patterson was voted off the board by shareholders in an uncontested election, with 56 percent of shareholder votes going against Patterson. (Paramount said the vote was a result of Patterson\u2019s role as lead independent board member and not because of his qualifications.)\n\u201cIt\u2019s very uncommon for shareholders to reject a director that way,\u201d said Michael Levin, founder of consulting firm the Activist Investor.\nParamount ultimately overruled the shareholders and kept Patterson on the board, Crain\u2019s reported. Paramount told shareholders it believed Patterson is a \u201cvaluable contributor\u201d with a \u201ctremendous skillset\u201d, according to an SEC filing.\nPatterson remains on Paramount\u2019s board of directors, serving on the corporate governance committee.\nThe ends justify the means\nPatterson\u2019s board participation \u2014 and prior relationships \u2014\u00a0have raised concerns elsewhere.\nPatterson serves on the board of Digital Realty, a data center REIT, where fellow Paramount board member, Greg Wright, is the chief investment officer.\nThe former chairman of Digital Realty, Laurence Chapman, took issue with Patterson and Wright\u2019s relationship. In 2023, Chapman resigned from Digital Realty\u2019s board and cited a number of alleged corporate governance issues by the board and Patterson in his resignation letter.\nIn addition to serving on Paramount\u2019s board of directors, Wright used to work for Patterson and the two are personal friends, Chapman claimed.\nChapman said these relationships had the \u201cpotential to impact real or perceived objectivity and independence\u201d of the board.\n(Digital Realty said in an SEC filing that the company \u201cwishes to emphasize that the written notification of resignation reflects the thoughts and beliefs of Mr. Chapman only.\u201d)\nChapman also alleged that Patterson personally contacted other company directors at Digital Realty to lobby for executive changes, claiming such maneuvers were improper for someone in his board member position.\n\u201cWhen I tried to discuss my concerns about his approach, Mark told me that in his view, \u2018The end justifies the means.\u2019 That principle originated in Machiavelli\u2019s \u2018The Prince,\u2019\u201d wrote Chapman in the letter.\nWhen it comes to the traits of good governance, Chapman went on, \u201cMachiavelli\u2019s principles seem to be the polar opposite.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A deal for a waterfront mansion in Malba, Queens, just set a new neighborhood record.\nA home at 117 Malba Drive closed for $6.3 million in August, making the priciest sale to hit the books in the wealthy enclave, known for its sprawling suburban-like abodes, according to public records. It last traded for $5.5 million in 2017, which held the previous record.\nThe Mediterranean-style estate hit the market last April with an asking price of nearly $8 million, according to Zillow. It snagged a signed contract in July after multiple price cuts brought its ask down to just under $7 million. The identities of both the buyer and seller were shielded by an LLC.\nThe property spans 8,300 square feet and has five bedrooms, seven bathrooms and a finished basement. It also features a backyard and multiple terraces. The deal includes a deeded boat dock in the neighborhood\u2019s private marina.\nPo Wei Tair of Remax 1st Choice in Great Neck, and Hui Fang Chen of Flushing-based AAA Young Shuen Realty had the listing.\n\nNews of the deal comes as prices have been rising in the luxury section of Whitestone, Queens. In the first quarter of 2025, Malba ranked as the 11th most expensive neighborhood in New York City with a median sale price of $1.6 million, falling just behind the Theatre District in Manhattan, according to a report from\nProperty Shark\n.\nSellers in the neighborhood have been trying to push prices to new heights for several years, though deals continue to fall short of their aspirations.\nAnother waterfront mansion at 3 Point Crescent hit the market in 2017 with an asking price of $9.2 million, at the time the most expensive asking price in Queens. However, the seven-bedroom home didn\u2019t land a buyer until five years later, when it finally sold for just $4 million. It\u2019s now under contract with a last asking price of $5.9 million.\nDespite its climbing prices, the top trades in the borough have largely occurred in the Rockaways. A beachfront home next to Jacob Riis Park scored Queens\u2019 priciest deal in 2023 when it closed for $8.3 million, followed by another home south of Rockaway Beach Boulevard, which sold for $7.6 million in March.\n",

        "content": "This week will determine the fate of two casino proposals in Manhattan.\nAfter more than two years of trying to sell their visions to the public, Wednesday is either the end of the road or a green light to embark on the final stage of the casino competition for Silverstein Properties and SL Green Realty.\nTwo Community Advisory Committees \u2014 each made up of six members \u2014\u00a0will vote on the proposals put forward by the two teams.\nAt least four members of each CAC must vote yes on the respective proposals for the projects to proceed to the final stage of the casino licensing competition. If approved, the proposals will be considered by the state\u2019s Gaming Facility Location Board, which will ultimately decide which three projects are awarded a license.\nA \u2018no\u2019 vote means the project is out of the running. It also means we get to see what becomes of the project sites sans casino. Silverstein has said its property will remain a \u201cgiant hole in the ground.\u201d SL Green\u2019s site is already an office tower, the long-term financial health of which has been\ncalled into question\nif the real estate investment trust does not secure a license.\nSL Green, which has teamed up with Caesars Entertainment, Roc Nation and Live Nation, wants to convert the 2 million-square-foot office building at 1515 Broadway in Times Square into a $5.4 billion casino, 992-key hotel, restaurants and an entertainment venue.\nSilverstein, along with Rush Street Gaming and Greenwood Gaming &amp; Entertainment, pitched the Avenir, a $7 billion casino complex planned for a vacant site at 41st Street and 11th Avenue. The project would feature a 1,000-key Hyatt Hotel, as well as restaurants, bars and a 150-seat entertainment venue. The developer has also committed funding to convert offices in and around Community Board 4 into 2,000 housing units. The firm hasn\u2019t named specific properties, but noted at its first public hearing last month that it had identified 92 feasible sites and was planning to evaluate another 146.\nThe CACs\u2019 votes are intended to determine whether a project enjoys public support or not. Of course, it is more complicated than that: CAC members were appointed by elected officials, some of whom have made their opposition to casinos clear. Both of the CACs, as with each of the other teams, held two public hearings on the proposals. You could tally up the speakers at those hearings (and in fact, Silverstein\u2019s team counted 122 speakers who supported its proposal at the last hearing, compared to 39 opposed), but that is a snapshot based on hearing attendance and is no guarantee of how CAC members will vote.\nBoth proposals have their detractors, the Broadway League and residents of Manhattan Plaza among the most vocal against the Times Square and Manhattan West proposals, respectively.\nTo what extent these voices, the CAC members\u2019 pre-existing positions on casinos and the various perks promised by the competitors factor into Wednesday\u2019s vote remains to be seen.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: I have a guess for how Wednesday\u2019s casino vote will go, but I want to hear from you. What proposals will make it through the CAC process to the competition\u2019s final round? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Fortis Property Group\u2019s Olympia Dumbo appears prominently in Spike Lee\u2019s new film, \u201cHighest 2 Lowest.\u201d In addition to several shots of the building\u2019s exterior, a model of the building also has a cameo, and at one point, A$AP Rocky\u2019s character name-drops the building.\n\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 A new report from State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli finds that New York will see relatively little benefit from the Republicans\u2019 sweeping new spending bill, with the biggest winners limited to seniors and tipped workers,\nThe City\nreports. While provisions like deductions for overtime pay, car loan interest and a higher cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions exist, most New Yorkers won\u2019t qualify or see significant savings. The findings set the stage for a fierce political battle ahead of the 2026 elections, as Republicans tout the cuts and Democrats highlight reductions to key safety net programs.\n\u2014\u00a0Rep. Jerry Nadler\u2019s retirement has sparked a crowded Democratic scramble for his Manhattan congressional seat, but Assembly member Micah Lasher has quickly emerged as an early front-runner and is reported to be Nadler\u2019s succession choice, according to\nCrain\u2019s New York\n. Lasher\u2019s political experience, West Side base and alignment with Nadler\u2019s progressive brand position him strongly. Still, a handful of younger or high-profile candidates may jump in. With no ranked-choice voting in the primary, even a narrow plurality could secure the nomination.\n\u2014\u00a0Gov. Kathy Hochul endorsed Zohran Mamdani for mayor in a\nNew York Times\nop-ed, calling him a partner in her priority to make New York more affordable while ensuring public safety and economic growth. Hochul highlighted areas of agreement \u2014 affordability, public safety, combating antisemitism \u2014 but repeatedly distanced herself from Mamdani\u2019s democratic socialist agenda, such as raising taxes on the wealthy.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$10.5 million\nfor a condominium unit at 944 Park Avenue.

        "content": "With the leasing market improving, Beacon Capital Partners and MetLife are taking another stab at trying to sell their Fifth Avenue high-rise office tower.\nThe partners put the 40-story building at 575 Fifth Avenue up for sale, eyeing a price north of $400 million,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nThat\u2019s roughly the same price the owners had in mind when\nthey put the property\nup for sale in the spring of 2022. Back then, they were only offering the 500,000-square-foot office condominium, which they own 50-50. This time around, MetLife is including the 40,000-square-foot retail condo at the base of the tower, according to an offering memo from Eastdil, which is handling the sale.\nRepresentatives for Beacon and MetLife did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An Eastdil team led by Gary Phillips and Will Silverman is overseeing the sales process.\nThe building is 87 percent occupied.\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear why Beacon and MetLife didn\u2019t sell the property three years ago, but the office leasing market has vastly improved since then. The year 2023 ended with about 29 million square feet of transactions in Manhattan, a decrease from the previous year.\nNow, 2025 is on track to record more than 40 million square feet worth of Manhattan office leases, which would be the first time the borough has cracked that figure since before the pandemic.\nThe Midtown building at the corner of East 47th Street sits across the street from Extell Development\u2019s 570 Fifth Avenue, where Gary Barnett has reportedly signed the law firm Simpson Thacher to a\n700,000-square-foot office lease\nto kick off the development of his planned 29-story office and retail project.\nMetLife bought 575 Fifth Avenue for $385 million in 2005 and sold a 50 percent stake in the office portion to Beacon for an undisclosed price in 2015.\n",

        "content": "Thaddeus \u201cTad\u201d Taube, a real estate titan of the San Francisco Bay Area and prolific philanthropist, has died at the age of 94.\nTaube died at his home in San Mateo County, according to a statement from Taube Philanthropies.\nBorn in Poland in 1931, Taube immigrated to the United States in 1939 with his parents Zygmunt Taube and Lola Popper Taube just before the Nazi invasion of the country. The family settled in California, with Taube even breaking into Hollywood as a boy with his role as a Polish child in the 1942 wartime film \u201cThe Greenie.\u201d\nTaube went on to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in industrial engineering and a master\u2019s in industrial management from Stanford University. He spent time in the U.S. Air Force before going on to work for two companies in the\nsemiconductor\nindustry. After his stint in tech, Taube turned his sights elsewhere.\n\u201cIf you were to draw a road map of my life, it would have multiple forks,\u201d the Polish philanthropist said. \u201cI often find myself driving along several paths at the same time.\u201d\nAt first, he joined forces with Stanford roommate Benjamin Johnson to create The Woodmont Companies. The firm went on to become one of the largest privately owned investment real estate companies on the West Coast.\nFrom there, he became chairman and CEO of Koracorp Industries, the successor to San Francisco-based apparel company Koret of California. He was in charge of the company from 1973 until 1979 when he negotiated the sale of the company to denim giant Levi Strauss.\nOnce he sold Koret of California, he established the Koret Foundation for charitable causes, leading the organization for the next quarter century.\n\n\u201cWhat struck me then, and has continued to stand out through two decades of watching Tad in action, is the depth of his philanthropic pursuits,\u201d former Secretary of State George P. Shultz once said of Taube. \u201cBeyond his generosity of spirit, Tad actively works to make a difference. He wants to see results.\u201d\nIn his home country, Taube founded and helped fund the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews in\nWarsaw\n.\nIn the Bay Area and across California, Taube funded projects including the revamp of the San Francisco Opera\u2019s performance space and the reinstallation of the Bay Bridge\u2019s \u201cBay Lights.\u201d He supported Stanford athletics through the construction of the Taube Family Tennis Stadium. Besides that, he launched programs for at-risk youth in tandem with Bay Area sports teams such as \u201cHoops for Kids\u201d with the Golden State Warriors, \u201cTouchdowns for Kids\u201d with the San Francisco 49ers and \u201cGoals for Kids\u201d with the San Jose Sharks.\nIn addition to sports, education and museums, Taube invested in health care initiatives like the Tad and Dianne Taube Pavilion at Stanford\u2019s children\u2019s hospital and efforts to address youth addiction, concussions, pediatric cancer and maternal and mental health. He helped launch the Neurodegenerative Disease Research Collaborative between several universities including Stanford.\nTaube is survived by his wife Dianne, who serves as president of Taube Philanthropies, and their children Mark, Paula, Sean, Juddson, Travis and Zakary.\n\u201cHis impact will shape the world for years to come,\u201d Dianne said.\n",

The seven condos are attached to Bowie House, the Auberge Resorts Collection hotel in\nFort Worth\u2019s Cultural District\n.\nThe 2,700-square-foot home, still under construction, has three bedrooms and two bathrooms. The other condos range from two to four bedrooms with asking prices between $5.5 million and $6.4 million, according to Douglas Elliman agent Hannah Sullivan, who has the listing.\n\nEntrepreneur and cutting horse champ Jo Ellard is the developer behind Bowie House. After years of traveling to Fort Worth for equestrian events, Ellard recognized the demand for luxury accommodations in Cowtown. The hotel and condos are close to Dickies Arena and the Will Rogers Memorial Center, which host rodeos and horse competitions. The property is also adjacent to the River Crest Country Club.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really the only thing like that there,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cWe really don\u2019t have any competitors.\u201d\nThe condos at Bowie House aren\u2019t just the first of their kind in Fort Worth;\nthey\u2019re among the first in Texas\n. Other branded luxury condo projects in the Texas pipeline include\ntwo Ritz-Carlton residences\n, an Auberge-branded condo development and a St. Regis tower, all in the Houston area, and\nthe Knox in Dallas\n, another Auberge concept.\nAlthough three of the units have already sold, this fourth residence was the first to be listed publicly, according to Sullivan. The rest are also under construction, and the next two are expected to list in October and November.Residential inventory has been steadily piling up in Fort Worth. It\u2019s no longer a seller\u2019s market,\nbut\ninventory is still lower\nthan the average in Dallas and in Texas overall.\n",

Horton, Perry Homes and McGuyer Homebuilders \u2014 each delivered more than 700 houses in federally mapped flood zones across the metro\u2019s five\nlargest\ncounties, Houston Chronicle\nanalysis\nfound. Those builders account for a significant\nshare\nof the 65,000 structures built in floodplains since the storm.\nTexas has no statewide code for\nfloodplain\nconstruction, leaving standards to local governments, which often allow development if homes are elevated and detention ponds are built. That flexibility has fueled suburban expansion but, critics say, ignores mounting climate risks.\nJim Blackburn, an environmental attorney and Rice University professor, told the outlet that developers are likely targeting cheaper, more available land in floodplains as large tracts elsewhere dwindle.\n\u201cWe have generally accepted floodplain development in the past,\u201d Blackburn told the outlet. \u201cI just think it may not be the right way to go forward in the future.\u201d\nMiami\n-based Lennar, through its Friendswood Development arm, has been especially active, with 5,700 homes built since Harvey, 25 percent of them in flood zones. Its projects include Tavola in New Caney, where residents reported major flooding during Tropical Storm Imelda just months after moving in.\n\nMeritage built nearly 3,000 homes \u2014 28 percent of them in floodplains \u2014 including the controversial Spring Brook Village in Spring Branch that drew sharp pushback from flood control advocates and residents that contended the elevated homes would make flooding in adjacent neighborhoods worse. That project ultimately won Houston City Council approval.\nD.R. Horton\nput up 8,100 homes, about 760 of them in high-risk zones, while\nPerry Homes\ndelivered 3,900, nearly 20 percent in mapped floodplains.\nPerry\u2019s Woodridge Village project near the Harris-Montgomery county line triggered lawsuits after nearby homes flooded; the dispute ended with a $14 million land sale to Houston and Harris County for detention basins.\nMcGuyer Homebuilders, now part of Dream Finders Homes, placed nearly a third of its 2,200 post-Harvey builds in flood zones, including portions of Towne Lake in Cypress.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Bookstores are doing something in the Houston suburbs once thought impossible in the digital age \u2014 expanding. Part of that strategy involves tacking a crack at retail real estate abandoned by other national chain stores.\nBarnes &amp; Noble is gearing up for three store openings across the metro area as part of a nationwide\ngrowth\nstrategy, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n. The bookseller confirmed upcoming locations in Spring, the Aliana community between Richmond and Sugar Land in Fort Bend County, and on Fry Road in Katy. The additions will bring its Houston-area store count to 15.\nIn Aliana, the company pre-leased an 18,000-square-foot building in the Market Center at 10191 Grand Parkway, according to developer Property Commerce. Construction is set to begin in weeks, with delivery expected in the spring or early summer. The retail center is nearly fully leased, anchored by H-E-B and Target, with the Barnes &amp; Noble site designed by LA Architects and built by U.S. Builders.\nAnother store will open in mid-November at the Target-anchored Grand Parkway Marketplace in Spring, taking over a 12,500-square-foot space formerly occupied by Party City, at 6600 Spring Stuebner Road. Another deal was inked for a nearly 22,000-square-foot former Party City in Katy\u2019s Greentree Shopping Center at 435 South Fry Road, which is slated to debut early next year, Ironbridge Realty confirmed.\n\nThese moves follow a January reopening of Barnes &amp; Noble\u2019s renovated Town &amp; Country Village store and a July 2024\nopening\nin the Conroe Marketplace in a space vacated by Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.\nThe Houston surge is part of Barnes &amp; Noble\u2019s broader rebound after years of shrinking. The chain said it\nopened\nmore stores last year alone than in the entire decade between 2009 and 2019, when it\nsold\nto hedge fund Elliott Management for $475 million cash.\nBy the end of this year, it expects to open more than 60 locations nationwide, with a similar pace planned for next year. It also recently struck a $3.25 million deal to acquire Books Inc., a longtime San Francisco Bay Area independent chain.\nThe company\u2019s strategy for success is not just in its retail expansion, but also to keep local bookshops in business. James Daunt, Barnes &amp; Noble\u2019s CEO, said last year that over the past couple of decades the company has bought and maintained bankrupt independent regional bookstores.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Veranda Apartments, which was delivered last year, is about 7 miles southeast of downtown, near the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport and the Tesla factory.\nBow River Capital coined and trademarked the term \u201cRodeo Region,\u201d which refers to the Southwest and Mountain West states of Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, Kansas, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Nebraska, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana and the Dakotas.\n\nThe firm also recently bought two properties in Kansas City, Missouri and the 337-unit Camden Midtown, at 2303 Louisiana Street in Midtown Houston, from Camden Property Trust and rebranded it as\nHadley Midtown Apartments\n.\nInvestors like Bow River Capital are calling bottom for Austin\u2019s multifamily market, which has been wrecked by a historic glut of supply that resulted in big losses for rent rates and occupancy.\nRents slid 7.5 percent\nlast month, compared to a year prior, and occupancy fell to 85 percent, according to ApartmentData.com.\nIn fact, rents have fallen so much that the city\nleads the country in rental affordability\n, JLL\u2019s Kai Pan said last month. Decreased rents, paired with high salaries, mean Austin renters, on average, spend 16.8 percent of their income on rent.\nAustin\u2019s tailwinds are promising, though, Pan said. In the last decade, the city has seen 30 percent population growth and 48 percent job growth. Its Sun Belt peers average growth rates of about 25 or 30 percent.\n",

The homes that went pending last week total $53.6 million in asking dollar volume and averaged 98 days on the market.

The condos that went pending are asking an average of $8.9 million, or $1,475 per square foot, and spent an average of 115 days on the market.\n\nThe single-family homes total $44.7 million in asking dollar volume and averaged 80 days on the market. The average asking price works out to $5 million\nThe most expensive home to go pending is the 6,200-square-foot house at 2352 Acorn Palm Road in\nBoca Raton\n, asking $7.5 million. It is in the gated\nRoyal Palm Yacht &amp; Country Club\n, Boca Raton\u2019s most expensive neighborhood.

David Roberts with Royal Palm Properties has the listing.\nThe second-priciest home to find a buyer last week is the 3,300-square-foot townhouse at 217 Everglade Avenue in\nPalm Beach\n, asking $7.3 million. Records show the seller is the estate of the late Gilbert C. Maurer, the former chief operating officer of media conglomerate Hearst, who died in April. He bought the townhome for $1.1 million in 1995, property records show. It was built that year, and has five bedrooms, five bathrooms, one half-bathroom and a pool, according to property records.\nIt hit the market on Sept. 5 asking $7.3 million and went pending three days later, Zillow shows.

        "content": "Marc Benioff recently said his tech company was able to cut thousands of jobs due to artificial intelligence, but rising demand in the sector is also leading the Salesforce CEO to add space at its Manhattan home.\nThe San Francisco-based company agreed to expand its footprint by 71,000 square feet at 3 Bryant Park, otherwise known as Salesforce Tower, CoStar\nreported\n. The dual expansion and renewal means Salesforce leases a 311,000-square-foot chunk of the 1.2-million-square-foot Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge property at 1095 Sixth Avenue.\nIn a statement, an executive for the tech company said its \u201cvision for real estate is to create the right spaces and experiences that accelerate growth and empower humans, agents and robots to work alongside one another.\u201d\nFinancial details of the lease were not disclosed, but Salesforce\u2019s lease is locked in through May 2029. The additional space will include an employee training center, collaboration and hybrid-work areas, and space for a customer-focused initiative.\nSalesforce\u2019s footprint has been boomeranging back and forth in recent years as the office landscape has changed. Last year, the company said it leased 900,000 square feet in its home city of San Francisco, a 45 percent reduction from the 1.6 million square feet it said it had in the city as of early 2023.\n\nArtificial intelligence is counterintuitively bringing tech companies back to their physical spaces, though. Tech companies\u2019 leasing rose 21 percent year-over-year in the first quarter, according to CBRE, accounting for about a sixth of total office leasing volume in the country.\nThis year, Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge\nlanded a $1.13 billion refi\nfor its trophy office tower, receiving a CMBS loan from Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Bank of Montreal. It paid $2.2 billion in 2015 to buy the Bryant Park tower, the second most-expensive office purchase in U.S. history at the time.\nThe property was 97 percent leased at the time of the refinancing.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

It is slated to be built on land that Marina Annex Housing acquired for $2 million in February, property records show. The seller was the Riviera Beach Housing Authority, which was deeded the land by the city in 2024 for $10 and remains a partner in the venture.\n\u201cThe way we can effectively work as the housing authority is to\u2026 partner with others to bring affordable housing to this community,\u201d said Riviera Beach Housing Authority Executive Director John Hurt.\nThe housing authority will also partner with the Alpha Phi Alpha Foundation to run the community center, which can be used for educational purposes, meeting room space and offices for nonprofits, he added.\n\nA later presentation by Harris of Urban Farmers revealed that the community center would be named after the late Edward Rodgers, the first Black circuit court judge of Palm Beach County.\nSince its founding in 1983, O\u2019Connor Capital Partners has developed $30 billion worth of projects in the U.S., Europe, Latin America, and Asia, according to the company\u2019s website. Led by CEO Bill O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Connor Capital\npaid $28.8 million for an 86,000-square-foot shopping center in Delray Beach\nin July.\nWorkforce housing developer Urban Farmers was started in 2010 by former Marriott International development manager Terry Booty. In 2019, the Hallandale Beach City Commission approved Urban Farmers\u2019 plan to build the 200-unit\nEighth Avenue Commons\nproject on a parking lot previously owned by the Hallandale Church of God.\nDevelopers are targeting Riviera Beach, as they seek new frontiers to build in Palm Beach County.\nTwo blocks east of Marina Annex\u2019s development site, Boca Raton-based SobelCo proposed a\n1.2-million-square-foot mixed-use project\nwith 508 condos at West 11th Street and Broadway. Between those two development sites the Riviera Beach Community Development Corporation is building Villa L\u2019Onz, a 12-unit workforce townhouse project.\nAnd on the east side of Broadway, Related Urban and the Related Group have secured development sites in the city-owned, 90-acre Marina Village area for\nResidences at Marina Village\n(a 149-unit workforce housing project) and\nGallery at Marina Village\n(a 418-unit market-rate project).\nThe Riviera Beach Community Redevelopment Agency is still entertaining additional development proposals at Marina Village after elected city officials\ndeclared a do-over\nin July after most developers sent incomplete applications for a previous request for qualifications. Anyone interested in building on publicly-owned waterfront land has until Nov. 18 to submit plans and qualifications.Related Urban, the only bidder to submit a completed application in July, will present plans to build a condo-hotel with food and beverage establishments, a Related Urban spokesman previously told\nThe Real Deal\n. Robert Sonnenblick, chairman of Pacific Palisades, California-based Sonnenblick Development, said he wants to build a two-phased project that will include a\n150-room Compass by Margaritaville hotel\n.",

The estate includes 5 acres of\nvineyards\nwhere the Malibu Rocky Oaks wine brand grows 10 grape varietals for red, white and ros\u00e9 offerings.\nMalibu Rocky Oaks was founded in 2003 by Howard Leight Sr. His son Howard Leight Jr. now runs the business. The Leights bought the property in 2005 for $3.5 million, per Realtor.com.\nIn the more than two decades since then, new local laws have prevented the opening of new wineries in the area, making the Rocky Oaks property that much more of a rare purchase. The sale would include the estate\u2019s grapes and irrigation sales, though a new owner wouldn\u2019t get ownership of the Malibu Rocky Oaks brand.\nThe family has been trying to sell the property since 2012 when it first hit the market for $43 million. The property went on and off the market several times after that and was even available for rent. It was\nlast listed in 2022\nfor $49.5 million.\nThe estate\u2019s Tuscan-style main house, built in 2009, sits on a hilltop and comes complete with a stone exterior and red tile roof, both essential in creating a natural fire resistance.\n\nThe 7,665-square-foot manse boasts classic Italian-inspired touches like stone fireplaces, wrought-iron balustrades and beamed ceilings as well as contemporary features like tall ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows. It contains five bedrooms and five bathrooms, including a primary suite with its own fireplace and private terrace.\nA rooftop terrace tops off the house, while a deck wraps around much of the exterior. Elsewhere outside, the home has an infinity-edge pool with a hot tub. Reality TV fans might recognize the property from \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d and\n\u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a one-of-a-kind property in which modern approvals for an estate of this scale and location would be next to impossible,\u201d Chris Cortazzo of Compass, who is helping handle the sale, said in a statement, per Realtor.com.\nThe online auction for the home is now open and ends Oct. 30, barring the seller accepting a bid before the deadline.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

But Aby Rosen\u2019s firm is seeking damages after allegedly doing significant due diligence on the property, only for that information to apparently facilitate the sale to another party.\nRFR filed a lawsuit Monday in New York County Supreme Court, The Promote\nreported\n. The company is suing the selling ownership entities, led by Luxottica heir and former Brooks Brothers CEO Claudio Del Vecchio, for unspecified damages.\nThe saga dates back to before the pandemic, when Del Vecchio started looking to offload the Brooks Brothers store at 346 Madison alongside an adjacent office building at 11 East 44th Street. They were put up for sale in 2021, according to the suit, via JLL.\nAfter struggling to sell the properties, RFR claims to have come on the scene, conducting extensive due diligence on a site mired by difficult zoning and capitalization issues. It allegedly reached an exclusivity and confidentiality agreement with the seller and shared information from its due diligence.\nThere was even a purchase and sale agreement put in place, according to the lawsuit. But after an exclusivity term expired, the agreement was allegedly \u201cduplicated into the name of another buyer and executed.\u201d RFR didn\u2019t name the buyer, but it likely didn\u2019t have to, as SL Green entered into contract on a $160 million acquisition at the start of this month.\n\nRFR alleges its confidential data was uploaded to a third-party site accessible to competitors, a breach that allowed SL Green to quickly scoop up a deal after RFR\u2019s exclusivity window closed. RFR likened the breach to a \u201cTrojan Horse.\u201d\nJLL listing broker David Giancola allegedly used RFR\u2019s interest in the property to \u201csqueeze out value\u201d from the deal, but Giancola is not listed as a defendant in the case.\nRFR declined to comment on the lawsuit to The Promote. Del Vecchio could not immediately be reached by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nIt\u2019s unclear how the lawsuit may affect SL Green\u2019s plans for a ground-up office development steps away from Grand Central Terminal; the site could house an 800,000-square-foot project. It\u2019s adjacent to 350 Madison Avenue, a 400,000-square-foot property owned by none other than RFR.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Bill Cosby is trying to cash out of his longtime Upper East Side mansion before the bank does it for him.\nThe disgraced 88-year-old actor listed his seven-story townhouse at 18 East 71st Street for $29 million, according to\nRealtor.com\n. The listing works out to $2,230 per square foot.\nThe move comes more than eight months after lender First Foundation Bank accused Cosby of defaulting on a $17.5 million loan tied to the 13,000-square-foot home. The bank claims he stopped making payments on the debt and owes more than $300,000 in property taxes.\nCosby and his wife, Camille, bought the limestone manse in 1990 for $6.3 million. Known as the Luyster Mansion, the residence dates to 1899 and is packed with period flourishes, from mahogany floors to an original elevator that still connects nearly every level.\nThe six-bedroom property boasts a dining room that seats 30, multiple suites, a roof garden and a parlor level for entertaining.\nCorcoran\u2019s Adam Schneider has the\nlisting\n, which marks the first time the property has hit the market in more than 35 years.\n\nThe 71st Street property isn\u2019t Cosby\u2019s only Manhattan fire drill.\nIn April, he listed another townhouse, a four-story property at 243 East 61st Street once used by his late son Ennis, for $7 million. That asking price was cut to $6.75 million in July. CitiMortgage accused Cosby and his wife of defaulting on a $4.2 million loan tied to that home and is\npursuing foreclosure\n.\nThe foreclosure suits are only the latest legal headaches for Cosby. His sexual assault conviction was overturned in 2021, but he continues to face fresh claims, including one in January accusing the actor of drugging and sexually assaulting a 15-year-old in Las Vegas in the 1980s.\nThese days, Bill and Camille primarily live outside Philadelphia, where they paid $225,000 for a suburban estate in the 1980s before \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d elevated the comedian to new heights.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Richard Elias signed the deed on behalf of the seller. The Miami Beach-based law firm Kellermann Varela is listed for the buyer.\nThe six-bedroom, four-bathroom house spans more than 5,000 square feet of interior space on a quarter-acre lot.

They also used a Delaware trust to purchase the property.\n\nA number of celebrities have called\nNorth Bay Road\nhome over the years, including Cindy Crawford and her husband Rande Gerber, Shakira and the Bee Gees\u2019 Barry Gibb.\nSince the pandemic, a handful of deals have set records on the street.\nLast year, David and Victoria Beckham paid\na then-record $72 million\nfor the waterfront spec mansion at 4736 North Bay Road. Months earlier, billionaire media mogul Barry Diller paid $45 million for the 1.5-acre waterfront lot at 5930 North Bay Road.\nEarlier this year, Todd Glaser and the Posner Group paid $105 million for Sonny Kahn\u2019s waterfront estate at 5940 North Bay Road. Glaser and his partner are looking to flip the property\nfor $169 million\n, or rent it out for $495,000 a month, but Glaser is also moving forward with plans to develop a spec mansion that could hit the market for $300 million.\nNext door, billionaire Jamie Salter, the founder, chairman and CEO of Authentic Brands Group, sold his waterfront 0.7-acre property at 5970 North Bay Road in January to brand mogul Anand Khubani\nfor $40 million\n.\nMarcelo Claure, the former CEO of Sprint and SoftBank Group International, is building a waterfront mansion nearby, at 5212 North Bay Road.\n",

That total was already the second-highest ever, behind 2022\u2019s record 136. If momentum holds, 2025 is on track to\nchallenge\nor top that peak.\nMuch of the action is in Winnetka, where @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate agent Jena Radnay has\ndominated\nthe leaderboard, repping one side or both in five of the year\u2019s top six deals. The suburb notched the year\u2019s headline-grabber: a 22-room lakefront estate that went for over $31 million, the highest price ever paid for an existing home in the Chicago area. Radnay told the outlet that Winnetka\u2019s mix of investment value and lifestyle draw buyers fast when properties enter the market.\nChicago itself has notched a\nmajority\nof the high-ticket sales this year. A Gold Coast condo crossed the $10 million mark, and Ken Griffin quietly sold two unfinished Gold Coast floors for a combined $15.9 million \u2014 deals that could end up ranking higher once ownership details are clarified. So far this year, 64 of the 109 luxury sales have been in Chicago.\n\nThe run isn\u2019t just about wealth cushioning buyers from inflation. Radnay said families are betting on long-term appreciation and paying premiums for lakefront security. Carrie McCormick of @properties Christie\u2019s said that scarcity drives urgency.\nThere\u2019s still potential reshuffling ahead, with a pair of pending suburban sales near $15 million in Kenilworth and Lake Forest. Even so, nothing comes close to Winnetka\u2019s record-setter.\nChicago\u2019s luxury market has come a long\nway\nsince the 2010s, when $4M deals averaged around 50 a year. Prices have swelled in the 2020s, with Redfin data showing the metro\u2019s median home price up 73 percent since 2019.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The proverb \u201cthe enemy of my enemy is not my friend\u201d does not apply to the controversy around\nTexas\u2019 House Bill 21\n.\nThe affordable housing reform law meant to close the state\u2019s \u201ctraveling\u201d housing finance corporation loophole has been heavily\ncriticized by the same people who advocated for reform\n. But the law\u2019s detractors aren\u2019t all on board with a\nlawsuit challenging HB 21\nthat was filed last week.\nThe lawsuit exacerbated the drama, since one of the entities that brought it is affiliated with Post Investment Group, which has used the traveling housing finance corporations loophole. Meaning the firm got tax credits on apartment complexes by partnering with housing finance corporations in counties other than where the properties are located.\nThis divisive Texas law has politicians and developers squabbling in a climate where real estate often gets what it wants from the legislature, but in this case, real estate is divided.\nIt\u2019s a Venn Diagram with three circles representing Rep. Gary Gates and his HB 21, affordable housing developers who didn\u2019t use the loophole and developers who partook of traveling tax credits.\nThe first two overlap in their opposition to the affordable housing scheme. But the next two overlap in their opposition to HB 21, meaning developers who didn\u2019t use the loophole oppose Gates, his law and the group of developers who used the loophole.\n\u201cThey screwed this up for people doing in-jurisdictional deals,\u201d Waterford Property Company\u2019s John Drachman said of developers that used the loophole. But he also opposes HB 21, which he argues is \u201canti-Texas\u201d for undermining local control and the decisions of local housing authorities.\nWaterford belongs in the second circle, and Drachman has been raising the red flag about the loophole for over a year.\nThe lawsuit was brought by Texas Workforce Housing Coalition and an affiliate of Post, the ground lease tenant of a San Antonio apartment complex that is a traveling housing finance corporation deal. It aims to legitimize these cross-juridictional deals, emphasizing that Chapter 394 expressly allows these kinds of deals and claims they were affirmed by governmental bodies, including appraisal districts.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re trying to craft a story of victimhood for both them and their partners and lenders and tenants especially that is just patently false,\u201d Drachman said.\nIn particular, he has a problem with the lawsuit\u2019s claim that HB 21 \u201cwill cause mass evictions of teachers, nurses and first responders.\u201d That\u2019s a lie, he said.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t comply, you don\u2019t get property tax exemptions. Then you have to pay your property taxes. I don\u2019t know why that would lead to mass evictions,\u201d he said.\nThe argument behind the lawsuit\u2019s contention is that if developers lose properties due to increased tax bills, new ownership could raise rents.\nDrachman concedes there\u2019s merit to the lawsuit\u2019s argument that HB 21 violates the Texas Constitution by affecting contracts already in place. HB 21 creates new affordability requirements for future housing finance corporations deals and requires that prior deals, including those that used the loophole, come into compliance with the stricter standards.\nHB 21 is the result of a campaign to outlaw traveling housing finance corporations. But the legislation that ended up getting signed was so divisive that it made enemies out of the loudest voices pushing for reform of the program.\nMeanwhile, Rep. Gates, who is a multifamily operator in Houston, has repeatedly called the arguments of his detractors \u201cred herrings,\u201d treating the loophole-using developers and the developers who didn\u2019t use it as the same group.\nGates\u2019 office said he wouldn\u2019t comment on pending litigation.\n",

New York-based Sculptor Capital Management provided the rest of the financing.\nThe package likely marks the largest condo construction financing in Tampa.\nMiami and West Palm Beach-based Two Roads, led by Taylor Collins and Reid Boren secured the debt for the Pendry Tampa and Pendry Residences\nTampa\n, which will have a 220-key Pendry hotel and a 207-unit condo component. The condo portion is more than 60 percent presold with more than $300 million in presales, according to the release.\nCondo prices range from $1.8 million to $5.8 million, excluding penthouses, according to a spokesperson.\n\nConstruction is underway on the fourth floor of the planned 38-story tower, which fronts the Hillsborough River. Amenities will include waterfront restaurants, more than 10,000 square feet of conference and ballroom space, a 14,000-square-foot spa and a fitness center.\nC-PACE stands for Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy, which encourages the use of energy efficient and sustainable materials and design. The Pendry project is being built more than 11 feet above sea level. The building\u2019s HVAC system and the design of the structure will save 55,701 lifetime metric tons of carbon, according to a press release from Nuveen. That\u2019s equivalent to the annual energy use of 7,500 homes in the U.S.\nThe project was once slated to become\nTrump Tower Tampa\nunder a different group of developers, the Tampa Bay Times previously reported.\nIn South Florida,\nTwo Roads\nand its partner, Alpha Blue Ventures,\nrecently completed\nFort\u00e9 on Flagler, a 25-story, 40-unit condo project in West Palm Beach. Nearly all the units were presold for a combined $289.1 million at the time the building was completed.\nTwo Roads\u2019 track record in the region is complicated by litigation surrounding its planned Edition Residences condo project in Miami\u2019s Edgewater.\u00a0In July, the Third District Court of Appeal\nruled in favor\nof a group of eight holdout owners who have been fighting the buyout of their condo building, Biscayne 21, for years. In 2022, Two Roads Development paid\nabout $150 million\nfor the majority of units at the bayfront 192-unit building, on the site where it plans to build Edition Residences. The following year, the holdout owners sued over the developer-controlled condo association amending the condo declaration to lower the requirement for a condo termination to 80 percent of owners, from 100 percent. Two Roads has said it plans to take the issue to the Florida Supreme Court.\n",

        "content": "A Hinsdale mansion brought in the highest sale price in the wealthy Chicago suburb in over a year, even after taking a 20 percent cut from its asking price.\nExcluding lakefront North Shore towns, the Elm Street deal in Hinsdale marks the priciest inland suburban home sale so far this year in Chicagoland, aside from a\nBarrington home featured in the hit TV show \u201cEmpire\u201d\nthat sold for $6.5 million. Yet that deal only closed after the home spent a dozen years on the market and originally listed for nearly $16 million.\nThe Hinsdale mansion at 818 South Elm Street, with seven bedrooms and eight-and-a-half bathrooms, sold for $5.9 million on Sept. 11. The 16,000-square-foot home sits on a tree-lined 1.27-acre lot that includes a swimming pool.\nColdwell Banker\u2019s\nDawn McKenna\nand Lauren Walz represented the property\u2019s seller, and Alexandra Shaban of Jameson Sotheby\u2019s represented the buyer. Both declined to comment on the deal. The house was previously owned under a land trust that obscures the owner\u2019s identity. The buyer is not yet reflected in public property documents.\n\nThe South Elm Street house was initially\nlisted at $7.3 million\nin August 2024, testing the upper end of the market for the high-end western suburb. It came off the public market in December 2024 and was not listed publicly again before selling.\nThe ultimate sale price of $5.9 million makes it the most expensive sale of the year in Hinsdale and among the priciest so far this year in Chicago\u2019s western suburbs. The last Hinsdale sale to surpass the Elm Street home\u2019s price closed in June 2024.\nHinsdale was ranked the 8th wealthiest suburb in the U.S. according to a July GOBankRates analysis,\nThe Real Deal reported\n. It had the highest year-over-year home value growth among the country\u2019s wealthiest suburbs in May 2025, with the total average home value reaching about $1.2 million on an 8 percent year-over-year gain.\nMany of the top western suburban sales this year have been in Hinsdale, including a $4.9 million house on South Park Avenue, a $4.7 million estate on County Line Road and a $4.5 million house on East 6th Street.\nTwo homes have fetched prices above $7 million in Hinsdale: A\n17,600 square-foot mansion\nsold for a record $7.7 million in 2021, and an off-market sale\nbrought in $7.5 million in 2022\n.",

        "content": "The long-floated redevelopment of a car wash in Lower Haight seems like it could finally start bubbling up.\nSan Francisco Supervisor Bilal Mahmood has introduced legislation that would allow buildings to follow the code at the time a proposal application was initially filed, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. Irvine-based developer 4Terra Investments got approval on its planned 203-unit project at 400 Divisadero Street in 2017.\n\u201cThe original approvals were based on the building code standards of 2016,\u201d Mahmood told the Chronicle. \u201cThey have to keep going back and\nchanging the project\n.\u201d\nUnder current regulations, San Francisco\u2019s building code requires projects to adhere to the building code in place when they break ground, rather than when the application was filed. The\nTouchless Car Wash project\nhas been stalled for nine years, and the building codes change every three. As a result, 4Terra has had to redesign its plans.\nIn the years since then, codes related to mechanical, electrical, plumbing, structural and energy have made projects such as these less feasible, tacking on an additional 5 percent to 7 percent of costs, according to the Chronicle. By using the regulations in place in 2016, the developer would save approximately $4 million on the project.\n\u201cWe wanted to see if we could solve the housing death spiral in which each delay results in other delays, compounding the problem,\u201d Mahmood said.\n\nThe project calls for 203 units to be built in six stories on the Touchless Car Wash site, including approximately 20 set aside for affordable housing. Mahmood\u2019s proposed legislation would reduce hurdles to getting shovels into dirt.\n\u201cAt a minimum what it does is gives us a little bit of relief in lower construction costs,\u201d 4Terra partner Amir Massih told the Chronicle. \u201cHaving somebody in City Hall advocating on your behalf is a welcome change from the past.\u201d\nUncertainty still remains a factor as tariffs could threaten to increase already high construction costs and equity partners are wary of investing in housing projects. But if the stars align and Mahmood\u2019s legislation allows the project to stick to its original application plans, groundbreaking on the project could happen next year, Massih told the Chronicle.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The plans from Frontier Group call for a 29-story tower rising approximately 300 feet and replacing a partially vacant two-story building on a narrow lot.\nThe project was first proposed in 2019, when the local lodging market was flourishing, but the pandemic ground that pace practically to a halt.\nChelsea Pacific Group, the owner of the historic seven-story Chancery Building next door to the proposed hotel, fought against the plan.\nChelsea Pacific argued that Frontier Group\u2019s planned hotel would be so close to the Chancery Building\u2019s side windows that it would block sunlight, decrease privacy and make it harder for the firm to find tenants for offices. It also pointed out the effects of noise, dust, air pollution and vibration caused by construction that can damage property. The building\u2019s office space is 96 percent leased \u2014 a notable success with the city\u2019s second-quarter office vacancy rate at 35.7 percent, according to JLL.\n\nChelsea Pacific submitted an economic analysis earlier this summer saying a new hotel isn\u2019t needed and would hurt existing hotels, but Frontier Group\u2019s analysis, completed by CBRE\u2019s hotel advisory group, said the proposed hotel will likely enter a \u201cstrong and viable\u201d market.\nSan Francisco visitor spending fell from $9.6 billion in 2019 to $2.7 billion in 2020, while the number of visitors dropped from 26.2 million to 11.8 million. Tourists have started flocking back, but tourism levels haven\u2019t yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. Tourism is expected to rise over the next year, with 23.5 million visitors projected this year, according to San Francisco Travel Association.\nHotel occupancy is projected to reach 65.2 percent this year and 66.3 percent next year. In the year before the pandemic, the rate was at 82.7 percent.\nHotel properties in San Francisco\nand across the Bay Area have seen better days. Hotel owners have fallen into\nloan default\nor faced\nforeclosure\n, bankruptcy,\ndepressed sale value\nand closure as the market gets back on its feet.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "H-E-B\u2019s long-awaited arrival inside Dallas city limits isn\u2019t getting the warm welcome the Texas grocer is accustomed to.\nThe San Antonio-based grocery chain is facing opposition over plans for a 127,000-square-foot store on nearly\n10 acres\nalong Interstate 635 at Hillcrest Road, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The company bought the land earlier this year, sparking celebration among shoppers who trek miles to reach the nearest H-E-B. But the site requires a zoning change from low-rise commercial to regional retail, which would allow a building up to 70 feet tall with heavy lot coverage \u2014 a scale that some neighbors say doesn\u2019t fit.\nSupporters argue the store would fill a\ngap\nin North Dallas retail options. Some residents praised H-E-B\u2019s reputation as a civic-minded operator and said traffic concerns were being exaggerated.\nBut homeowner groups are rallying against the project, citing congestion, truck loading zones and design issues. The Hillcrest Forest Neighborhood Association, which has circulated petitions, called the store \u201cout of character\u201d with the area and warned it could dump 6,000 additional cars onto an already busy intersection.\n\nThe pushback is consistent with a \u201cnot in my backyard\u201d streak that has shaped development battles in affluent North Dallas. Similar concerns have derailed or delayed projects like the Pepper Square\nredevelopment\n3 miles north. This latest fight is less about H-E-B itself than the scale of the plan \u2014 most H-E-B stores sit on 20 acres, double the proposed footprint. Some have suggested the grocer relocate to the former Valley View mall site 2 miles away, a sprawling 110-acre property already zoned for retail.\nMabrie Jackson, H-E-B\u2019s public affairs director, said the company has met with neighbors since January and is committed to being \u201ca good neighbor.\u201d The rezoning request heads to the Dallas City Plan Commission this week before reaching Dallas City Council. If approved, construction could still be years out \u2014 with 2028 pegged as the earliest opening date.\nH-E-B\u2019s growing presence since the grocer entered Dallas-Fort Worth in 2022 has driven competitors such as Walmart, Kroger and Tom Thumb to increase their investments in the region. Kroger also\nsignaled\nits own North Texas expansion plans with four new stores announced last month.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The bank plans to occupy the four floors for four years as it renovates its headquarters at 240 Greenwich Avenue.\nDiscussions over a possible sublease deal were reported by the Commercial Observer back in May. Further details about the financial arrangement were\nnot disclosed\n.\nJLL represented BNY in the sublease deal, while CBRE\u2019s Scott Gottlieb represented the publisher. Newmark also gave building co-owners The Durst Organization and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey a seat at the table.\nCond\u00e9 Nast will need to figure out a strategy for the space four years down the line, as its lease doesn\u2019t expire until the end of the next decade. Cond\u00e9 leases 1.2 million square feet in the 104-story, 3.1 million-square-foot building, but started subleasing space almost immediately after moving in.\n\nSince 2019, more than 230,000 square feet had been claimed by subtenants before this latest agreement. Last year, financial advisory firm Kroll\nleased 48,000 square feet\nfrom the publisher on a 10-year deal with an asking price of $59 per square foot.\nCond\u00e9 publicly fought with its landlords at one point, withholding $2.4 million in rent after the onset of the pandemic as it attempted to renegotiate its lease. It ultimately paid the amount owed in full.\nIn May, Durst made the 89th and 90th floors\navailable to lease\n, the first time they\u2019re being marketed to office tenants. The landlord is looking to capitalize on the sky-high floors and garner rents in the ballpark of $160 per square foot.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The debt comes due in October after several extensions.\nThe owners, a group led by Midtown-based Atlas Capital Group, were current on their payments through August, according to Morningstar. The loan had not previously been delinquent, but the building\u2019s financials have steadily worsened. Operating expenses have climbed every year since the loan originated in 2020. At the same time, income has eroded.\nOccupancy stood at just over 73 percent as of the second quarter. That\u2019s\ndown from\n83 percent in 2020. The largest tenant, Macy\u2019s marketing department, occupies 146,000 square feet across three floors, according to CoStar data. Other tenants include the New York City School Construction Authority, Tourneau and Polo Ralph Lauren.\nUnder the loan agreement, the borrowers have already exercised three extension options. If they can\u2019t secure new financing, the property could be at risk of default.\n\nOriginally built in 1926 as a Macy\u2019s furniture warehouse, Atlas Capital, Invesco and Square Mile Capital Management acquired the property at a bankruptcy sale in 2013. They invested more than $90 million to redevelop it into creative office space with large floor plates, high ceilings and Class A amenities. In 2018, Partners Group invested in the complex by buying a portion of Square Mile\u2019s stake in a deal that valued the property at\n$400 million\n.\nIn 2020, the owners secured a\n$300 million\nCMBS loan from Credit Suisse subsidiary Column Financial. In July, Moody\u2019s downgraded the mortgage from AAA, to the equivalent of AA+, according to\nCrain\u2019s\n.\nA representative for Atlas Capital did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Partners Group declined to comment.\nWhile Manhattan\u2019s trophy towers have led a recent wave of leasing activity, outer-borough landlords have struggled to land tenants. Long Island City\u2019s availability rate hovered just below 27 percent in the first half of 2025, according to CBRE, compared to Manhattan\u2019s overall availability rate of 17.5 percent.\n",

Another affiliate of Lithia acquired West Palm Beach Hyundai, a 5.4-acre dealership at 2301 Okeechobee Boulevard, for $23.5 million.\nOak Terrace, Illinois-based Ed Napleton Automotive Group sold the two properties to Lithia. Ed Napleton paid $7.5 million for the Acura dealership in 2009, records show. The site has three buildings completed in 1986, 2004 and 2016.\nIn 2010, Ed Napleton acquired the Hyundai dealership, which includes three buildings completed in 1966 and 1969, for $4 million, records show.\n\nWith more than 298 dealerships across the U.S., Lithia is among the nation\u2019s biggest retail automotive groups, according to the company\u2019s website. Lithia entered the South Florida market in 2021 with its $43 million purchase of two Audi dealership complexes in Fort Lauderdale and Coral Springs, published reports state.\nThe following year, Lithia paid a combined\n$96 million\nfor nine auto dealerships in Miami-Dade County previously owned by the Lehman family and the late Miami philanthropist Ron Esserman.

        "content": "After months of deriding everyone and everything from Gov. Gavin Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass to proposed wildfire recovery bills, Spencer Pratt is turning his focus to another piece of controversial legislation.\nThe reality TV personality has taken to social media to call out Senate Bill 79, the recently approved measure that would upzone areas near transit hubs to increase density, Politico\nreported\n.\nThe bill\npassed the California Senate last week\nand is headed to Newsom\u2019s desk. It calls for boosting housing density across the state by allowing apartment buildings of up to nine stories next to train stations and major transit stops. Most cities in California have zoned the land around transit stops for single-family homes.\nPratt\nblasted\nthe bill on Instagram, sharing a video of the January wildfires that\ndestroyed his Pacific Palisades home\nand urging followers to \u201cCall Newsom and tell him Palisades can\u2019t have more density\u201d and to \u201cStop SB 79.\u201d\nThere are no train stations or major transit hubs in the Pacific Palisades. State Sen. Scott Wiener, who authored the bill, noted the concern over a non-issue for Pratt.\n\u201cHe\u2019s spreading a bald-faced lie, saying that SB 79 applies in the Palisades,\u201d Wiener told Politico. \u201cIt does not, and that is shameful.\u201d\nLast month, the Los Angeles City Council passed a resolution expressing opposition to the plan with the support of Mayor Karen Bass. The bill ended up passing in the state legislature last week.\n\nPrior to the SB 79 outrage, Pratt criticized Senate Bill 549, which would establish a government body to determine a path forward after January\u2019s deadly wildfires. Opponents such as Pratt argued it would allow Los Angeles County to take over burned lots and sell them to the highest bidder.\n\u201cThe Hills\u201d star expressed his disdain for SB 549 in a series of videos on\nTikTok\n. He claimed he consulted with an artificial intelligence chatbot that told him the bill would allow L.A. County to buy burned lots in the Palisades and convert them into low-income housing, remove local zoning decisions and push for denser reconstruction in the area. That bill was\npaused in the legislature\nafter Bass raised concerns about its effects.\n\u201cInstead of a [recovery] plan to make the city affordable for its residents, we have Spencer Pratt influencing the mayor of L.A. to kill housing,\u201d Matthew Lewis, a spokesperson for California YIMBY, told Politico.\nPratt also criticized Senate Bill 9, which was signed into law in 2021. The legislation was meant to address the state\u2019s housing shortage by allowing homeowners in most single-family residential zones to split their lot into separate parcels and build two units on a single lot. Following Pratt and Bass\u2019\ncriticism\nof the law, Newsom waived its enforcement in fire-prone areas.\nIt remains to be seen whether Newsom will sign SB 79 into law. As for Pratt\u2019s influence on the governor, it appears to be nonexistent.\n\u201cOur office doesn\u2019t communicate with Spencer Pratt,\u201d Newsom spokesperson Tara Gallegos told Politico. \u201cI don\u2019t even think the governor knows who he is.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Multifamily developers are getting their ducks in a row in Chicagoland, overcoming a tight market for raising equity and landing construction loans to take advantage of a limited construction pipeline.\nWill Hunter and Evan Meador\u2019s firm Continuum Capital became the latest to take major steps toward getting a project out of the ground this week with a $31.2 million acquisition of\nChurch Street Plaza\nin downtown Evanston, a retail center eyed for redevelopment into a 27-story, 358-apartment tower. The deal was funded by a $26.5 million loan from Wheaton-based lender T2 Capital.\nTheir development venture, which also includes Aaron and Amy Galvin\u2019s firm Luxury Living, bought the 145,000-square-foot property from a venture of retail developer\nMitch Goltz\n, who acquired it in 2019 by assuming the remainder of a loan that a previous owner had taken out on the building. Goltz renovated the property and began leasing it up, then refinanced it with a $19.5 million loan from Old National Bank in 2023, public records show. It is 98 percent leased today.\nThe deal adds momentum to the Chicago-area apartment development pipeline, which has shrunk in recent years due to the rising costs of building materials and debt, plus a difficult environment for fundraising to make real estate acquisitions and capitalize construction projects. The result has been upward pressure on Midwest rents in existing buildings, which has drawn interest to the region from more institutional buyers.\nBut developers have begun reigniting the market in recent weeks.\nIn Chicago\u2019s West Loop,\nTim Anderson\u2019s firm Focus Development\n, along with partners DAC Developments and Melrose Ascension Capital, pulled in $96 million in construction financing to build a 287-unit apartment project at 1221 West Washington Street. An office-to-residential conversion project for\n65 East Wacker Place\nin Chicago that\u2019s being led by Adam Friedberg\u2019s firm Mavrek after an acquisition out of distress also scored a $90 million construction financing package.\n\nThe Evanston development team plans to dedicate 72 apartments resulting from the project to Evanston\u2019s affordable housing program by limiting them to households making certain fractions of the area median income.\n\u201cWhile our proposal for 900 Clark Street was not contingent on purchasing Church Street Plaza, this was a compelling opportunity to acquire a high-quality asset in a high-barrier-to-entry location,\u201d Continuum\u2019s co-founder Meador said.\nGoltz, the seller, declined to comment.\nThe Continuum team will work to start pre-construction involving the renovation of the retail into the base of the tower. It will seek a separate construction financing package for the approximately $130 million multifamily project.\nPreviously with\nMichigan Avenue Real Estate Group\n, which is backed by Bulls and White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf, Meador helped lead the development of over 1,100 apartments in Chicago\u2019s West Loop and surrounding suburbs, including Evanston, where the firm built Maeve on Ridge, a luxury rental building at 1555 Ridge Avenue.\n",

        "content": "Rithm Capital is nearing the finish line to acquire New York City and San Francisco office landlord Paramount Group, according to sources familiar with the matter.\nThis comes after a months-long\nmultiple-round bidding process\n, which included SL Green, Vornado, Blackstone, Empire State Realty and DivcoWest with Dubai-based Saray Capital, sources said.\nThrough the acquisition, Rithm, one of the largest mortgage servicers in the U.S., can expand deeper into commercial real estate amid an acquisition spree.\u00a0The news was first reported in the Wall Street Journal.\nIf the deal goes through, Rithm will take on Paramount\u2019s 17-building office portfolio in New York City and San Francisco, totaling 13 million square feet of space. Among the more notable properties: 1301 Sixth Avenue, 1633 Broadway and 900 Third Avenue in New York City\nParamount announced in May that it hired Bank of America as a financial advisor to explore strategic alternatives, including the possibility of a sale. The news came as the company and its CEO faced increasing scrutiny.\nParamount revealed earlier this year that it made millions of dollars in previously undisclosed payments to Behler\u2019s personal expenses and outside companies over the past three years. This included $900,000 on Behler\u2019s personal accounting services and $3 million on a private jet firm, co-owned by Behler.\nA short time later, an analyst at Green Street Advisors called for the removal of certain Paramount board members, citing management\u2019s high compensation relative to its stock performance.\nIn July, Paramount\ndisclosed it was under an investigation\nby the Securities and Exchange Commission in its second-quarter report.\n\nThe Real Deal\nreported in August that\nBehler personally pushed for a no-bid contract\nto a security company where his ex-girlfriend, 30 years his junior, was a senior manager. Text messages reviewed by\nTRD\nshowed Behler and the employee maintained a friendly personal relationship years after their romantic relationship ended. (In those messages, the employee refers to Behler as \u201cAlbertcim,\u201d using a suffix meant to show endearment in the Turkish language, with the term roughly translating to \u201cmy dear Albert.\u201d)\nParamount has also seen an exodus of top employees in recent months. Paramount announced Wilbur Paes, the firm\u2019s chief operating officer, chief financial officer and treasurer, and Gage Johnson, Paramount\u2019s general counsel, left the company.\nParamount was founded in 1978 by German mail-order entrepreneur Werner Otto. Behler was appointed as president and CEO in 1991. The firm went public in 2014 with an initial public offering of $2.3 billion, the largest IPO for a U.S. REIT at the time.\nParamount, like other office landlords, took a hit during the pandemic as occupancy dropped and employees worked from home. But as the office market has rebounded, Paramount\u2019s New York City portfolio is up to 88 percent leased as of its second quarter, the highest mark since 2022. In its most recent quarter, Paramount reported a net loss attributable to shareholders of $19.8 million.\nAs of today, Paramount has a market capitalization of $1.56 billion with its stock price hovering around $7, about half of what the stock was trading at prior to the pandemic.\nWhen the company announced its plan for a possible sale, Behler said the company and board \u201cremain focused closing the persistent gap between the company\u2019s public market valuation and our assessment of its intrinsic value.\u201d\nRithm, which has $36 billion in assets under management, has expanded from a mortgage servicing company. In 2023, it purchased the hedge fund Sculptor Capital Management. More recently, it inked a deal to buy Crestline, a $17 billion private lender.\n",

Penrod seeks to overturn the awarding of a new contract for the city-owned property at 1 Ocean Drive that is home to Nikki Beach Club. The 2023 complaint, filed in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, also names Penrod\u2019s rival, Boucher Brothers, as a defendant.\nA bid by\nBoucher and Major Food Group\nwon the city\u2019s request for proposals, and the joint venture is set to take control of the property at 1 Ocean Drive next year when Penrod\u2019s current ground lease expires.\nBut dozens of texts by city staffers, recently released via the discovery process, could help Penrod bolster its case that Miami Beach officials violated procurement rules and showed bias in selecting a new operator.\nA text conversation on Sept. 2, 2023 between ex-Miami Beach City Attorney Raul Aguila, current city attorney Ricardo Dopico and chief deputy city attorney Nicholas Kallergis stands out.\nThe thread begins with Aguila texting his former colleagues a link to a\nMiami Herald\narticle detailing how Miami Beach rejected\nPenrod\u2019s bid\nbecause it was submitted 15 minutes after the city\u2019s deadline. \u201cHow STUPID are they???\u201d Aguila wrote.\n\u201cI\u2019d hate to be the dumbass who waited until [2:59 p.m.] to submit. Imagine there\u2019s a malpractice claim there,\u201d Dopico responded.\n\u201cI\u2019m having multiple orgasms just thinking about it. You guys have all the fun!!!!!!,\u201d Aguila replied.\n\u201cOmg for sure that kid is fired,\u201d Kallergis texted.\n\n\u201cWhat a fitting denouement for the Penrod\u2019s saga!\u201d Aguila shot back.\nAguila, who retired from the city in 2022, Dopico and Kallergis did not respond to requests for comment about the texts, which were first reported by\nMiami New Times\n. Daniel Hanlon, a lawyer representing Boucher, did not respond for comment either. A Miami Beach spokesperson declined to comment.\nPrintouts of the text messages were provided to\nThe Real Deal\nby a Miami Beach resident who requested anonymity.\nIn an emailed statement, Penrod said it sought court intervention to \u201crequire the city to hold a fair and lawful process for this public land.\u201d\n\u201cFormer city leaders violated laws requiring public competition which led to the challenge we brought,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe believe our position is supported by clear law and overwhelming evidence.\u201d\nCity officials faced intense public scrutiny over their handling of the 1 Ocean Drive property\u2019s future. Penrod has controlled the property since the 1980s via its ground lease, and the firm launched Nikki Beach Club in 1997. The name is in honor of late Jack Penrod\u2019s daughter Nicole, who was killed in a car accident the same year the venue was renamed from Penrod\u2019s on the Beach.\nIn April 2023, the Miami Beach City Commission initially voted to negotiate a no-bid deal with\nBoucher\n, which provides beach concessions under a separate city contract, and Major Food Group, the New York-based hospitality firm that owns Carbone and other high-end restaurants.\nA month later, commissioners\nreversed their decision\nafter a wave of public backlash, and voted for a competitive bid process that Boucher and Major Food Group subsequently won. The joint venture is getting a 10-year lease that the city claims will pay Miami Beach $41 million over the life of the agreement.\nDuring the discovery process,\nPenrod\nalso previously obtained emails showing then-Mayor Dan Gelber, then-Vice-Mayor Ricky Arriola and city staffers regularly hit up Boucher and Major Food Group principals for beach chairs and dinner reservations.",

        "content": "The Los Angeles City Attorney is bringing the hammer down on illegal homes in Laurel Canyon.\nA plea deal with city prosecutors put an end to a decades-long saga over five partially built homes in the mountainous enclave,\nCity Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto\n\u2019s office said this week.\nThe plea agreement with Shahram and Ester Ghalili stems from the abandoned hilltop properties on Woodstock Road.\nIn 2023, the city attorney\u2019s office filed 25 counts against the Ghalilis over their five unfinished three-story single-family homes in\nLaurel Canyon\n. The couple bought the property in 2020 in an attempt to revive plans pursued by private developers for decades to build homes at the site.\nThe development started as a large project that was eventually shut down by the City in 2002. The following year, the city ordered the homes to be demolished. Instead, they remained in the hands of multiple developers who weren\u2019t able to further develop the project.\n\nNeighbors reported increased construction activity at the homes after the Ghalilis took ownership, according to the\ncity attorney\n\u2019s office. City officials demanded the owners to comply with the demolition order and clean up the properties.\n\u201cFor far too many years, the Laurel Canyon community has dealt with these dangerous, dilapidated homes that were ordered to be taken down more than two decades ago,\u201d Feldstein Soto said. \u201cWe took action to end this problem once and for all.\u201d\nShahram Ghalili pleaded no contest last month to five counts of failing to comply with lawful orders issued by the Department of Building and Safety. He was placed on formal diversion for one year and is required to demolish all five homes by Aug. 7 of next year, in addition to paying $5,000 in fines. Failure to do so will result in a conviction on his record, 12 months of summary probation, 100 hours of community service and $25,000 in fines and penalties.\n",

Shaw\u2019s Georgian red-brick mansion, one of more than 40 he designed in\nLake Forest\n, sits on 2.5 acres at 788 East Woodland Road and spans 7,300 square feet with five bedrooms, formal gardens and sun porches. The asking price equates to $1,030 per square foot.\nThe home served as the set for the 1980 drama \u201cOrdinary People,\u201d directed by the late Robert Redford and starring Mary Tyler Moore and Donald Sutherland. It won the Academy Award for Best Picture as well as three other Oscars. The home\u2019s cameo cemented its place in Hollywood-Chicago lore.\nThe sellers are the heirs of Peggy Crowe, who bought the house with her husband, Jack, in the 1990s. The Crowes preserved the estate\u2019s historic character while adding modern touches, including a pool house by Liederbach &amp; Graham. Compass brokers Marina Carney and Andrew Mrowiec are handling the listing.\n\nDescribing its condition as \u201ctimeless\u201d and \u201cmeticulous,\u201d Carney told the outlet that all prior owners preserved the early 1900s design touches, including the ornate pine-paneled walls of the living room and limestone floors in the entrance hall. The listing also describes original French doors with restored brass cremone bolts, a garden room with panoramic views of the south lawn, hand-scraped pine floors and custom cabinetry in the kitchen, butler\u2019s pantry and breakfast room and a geothermally-heated swimming pool.\nIf it trades\nabove\n$7 million, the estate will join a small\nclub\nof Lake Forest homes to cross that threshold this decade. Only two have done so in recent years, though another \u2014 an 8-acre spread\nlisted\nat $15 million \u2014 has been under contract since July.\nThe house\u2019s pedigree extends beyond its architecture. Commissioned by banker Leverett Thompson and his wife, Helen, the estate quickly became one of Lake Forest\u2019s \u201cshow places,\u201d with gardens designed by Boston\u2019s Rose Standish Nichols and New York\u2019s Charles Platt. Later owners included members of the Chicago meatpacking dynasty Swift family.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Apartment starts in the region have fallen to just a few hundred per quarter from more than 3,000, per the Business Times. It aligns with a nationwide trend of 542,800 units under construction at the end of the second quarter \u2014 the lowest level in a decade, according to RealPage data cited by the Business Times.\nThe project from Bozzuto and Kimco\u2019s joint venture, known as\nThe Chester at Westlake\n, calls for a five-story mixed-use building that will house studios, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments, most of which will come equipped with balconies or terraces. Residents will have access to 13,000 square feet of amenities as well as nearly 10,000 square feet of ground-floor retail.\nArtificial intelligence\u2019s growing influence on the Bay Area has so far manifested in companies flocking to the region and setting up offices. Employees have followed, bringing in new renters to the Bay Area. With an expected influx of tens of thousands of AI workers over the next five years, office vacancy in San Francisco alone is predicted to be\ncut in half\n, according to CBRE.\nThe AI boom didn\u2019t play a part in The Chester at Westlake\u2019s construction, as Bozzuto began studying the site three years ago.\n\n\u201cI was bullish on Daly City,\u201d Bozzuto president and CEO Toby Bozzuto told the Business Times. \u201cThe AI jobs and the broader resurgence \u2014 that\u2019s just the icing on the cake.\u201d\nBozzuto and\nKimco\nare pursuing the project with financing from J.P. Morgan and a plan to use wood-frame construction and non-union labor as a means of lowering construction costs. In the Bay Area, most apartments are built for about $600,000 per unit, making new multifamily construction unfeasible for many developers.\nCurrent vacancy in San Mateo County is approaching a 20-year low at approximately 4 percent, per CoStar data cited by the Business Times. Rents, meanwhile, have risen 5 percent in the past year \u2014 the quickest spike since 2022.\nThe Chester at Westlake is scheduled to open by the end of 2027.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Frost Bank is jumping ahead of the Federal Reserve by lowering mortgage rates and waiving some fees in a bid to grab market share across Texas.\nThe San Antonio-based bank rolled out a 50-basis-point cut on conventional and jumbo mortgages effective Sept. 8, bringing its 30-year fixed conventional rate to 6 percent, 15-year conventional to 5 percent, and both 30- and 15-year jumbo products to 5.75 percent.\nThe lender is also waiving up to $1,200 in administrative fees for all conventional and jumbo borrowers. Its Progress Mortgage division, geared toward low- and moderate-income borrowers, is priced at 5.75 percent and already carries a fee waiver, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe timing is notable: on Sept. 15, Bankrate pegged the average national 30-year fixed\nmortgage\nannual percentage rate at 6.39 percent and refinance APR at 6.73 percent. No other Texas lender has matched Frost\u2019s rate and fee package so far, though analysts expect broader declines after the Fed\u2019s Sept. 16\u201317 meeting.\n\u201cInstead of waiting for the Fed or the markets, we decided to lower the cost barrier for potential homebuyers or refinancers now,\u201d said Bill Day, senior vice president at Frost.\nThe math could help some potential home buyers\npull the trigger\non a purchase.\n\u201cOver the last 30 days, I\u2019m quoting 6 to 6.25 percent on conventional and FHA/VA loans, down from 6.75 to 7 percent,\u201d Brian Gutierrez of NEO Home Loans in San Antonio told the outlet.\n\nGutierrez said he is seeing a surge in first-time buyers targeting homes under $400,000, spurred by easing rates and seller concessions. In San Antonio, the average market time is 88 days \u2014 a 14-day increase from the San Antonio Board of Realtors\u2019 July report \u2014 and sellers are\noffering\n$7,500 to $12,000 in closing cost assistance.\nGutierrez said refinances are also climbing \u2014 up 42 percent year-over-year statewide, according to ATTOM Data Solutions \u2014 as borrowers look to shed debt and lock in savings. But he noted that high credit card balances, a byproduct of prolonged high interest rates, are still sidelining some would-be refinancers.\nFrost just jumped back into the mortgage business last year. The bank focuses on in-house servicing and is positioning itself as a market leader, Day said.\nFrost might have forced a rate war if competitors follow suit.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Building New York City real estate is never easy. But some projects are more difficult than others.\nAfter years of hurdles, a 144-unit affordable and senior housing project in Forest Hills, Queens, has secured financing and is set to break ground. TD Bank loaned $37.5 million for construction, while Community Preservation Corp is providing a $40 million long-term loan. On the public side, the city is providing $71 million from a program for senior housing.\n\u201cAs an affordable housing developer, I\u2019ve never seen anything as difficult as this,\u201d said Jeff Fox, of Foxy Development, which is co-developing the project. \u201cNothing about this was easy.\u201d\nFrom conception to construction, the project changed plans several times. The property at 70-35 113th Street, dubbed The Perennial, is the site of an abandoned hospital. It was upzoned in 2020 with an agreement that it would include a certain amount of senior affordable housing.\nTypically, developers in these upzoned areas build their affordable and market-rate apartments in one building, with the market-rate units subsidizing the affordable units. But because of a complex ownership structure, the two portions of the project were kept separate, allowing Fox\u2019s team to pursue public financing for a fully affordable development while a market-rate development next door can still take advantage of the upzoning.\nAt one point, the Perennial was envisioned as a fully senior housing development, financed by tax-exempt state bonds, according to Fox. But that plan fell through, and the team scrapped their designs for 20 non-senior affordable units. The city provided funds, pledging money from its Senior Affordable Rental Apartments program.\n\nThe backstory of the financing lines up with promises of increased public-private partnerships touted by Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic candidate for mayor. Mamdani has proposed tripling the city\u2019s production of publicly subsidized, permanently affordable housing. Fox said there were many times the Department of Housing Preservation and Development could have walked away from the deal, but officials wanted to make something happen despite setbacks and an out-of-the-box structure.\n\u201cThis is a part of Queens where we have long wanted to build more affordable housing,\u201d said Ahmed Tigani, acting commissioner of HPD. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need every part of the city to help build housing for the people who need it.\u201d\nThe plan is now to redevelop the interior of the hospital building while adding two stories on top. A section of the building will be carved out as the future home of the Forest Hills Jewish Center. The units will be available to households earning up to 50 percent of the area median income. HPD is also providing a rental subsidy through federal Section 8 funds. Of the 124 senior units, 20 will be set aside for formerly homeless seniors.\nServices for seniors will be provided by co-developer Selfhelp Realty Group, which focuses on senior housing. The Forest Hills site will be the company\u2019s first intergenerational property.\n\u201cIt was a great opportunity to start to look at something that we see as a priority for the city, moving more toward intergenerational housing,\u201d said Lisa Trub, executive director of Selfhelp. \u201cWe do think that we can kind of replicate a similar model and not be totally reliant on HPD financing.\u201d\nThe market rate development next door, which is owned separately and which the Fox and Selfhelp teams are not involved with, will be 13 stories and 241 units. TopRock Capital and RJ Holdings\nsecured $125 million last year\nto build condos on the site.\n",

The sellers of the unit at\n1125 Fifth Avenue\nwere\nSteven and Debra Wisch\n, and the buyer was a trust. Steven Wisch is the co-founder and executive chairman of healthcare company Network Eye, and Debra Wisch is a documentary film producer. The four-bedroom pad spans 4,600 square feet; the deal pencils out to just over $3,900 per square foot. The unit, which has Central Park views, a library and a wood-burning fireplace, went on the market in September 2024 for $20 million. Douglas Elliman\u2019s\nSabrina Saltiel\nhad the listing.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe top commercial sale in the city was for a two-family townhouse in Cobble Hill. Attorneys\nAnwar Ragep\nand\nAngela Libby\npurchased the 4,100-square-foot property at\n192 Warren Street\n, which has an owner\u2019s triplex and a garden-level studio apartment, for $8.1 million. The seller was an LLC tied to footwear designer\nTull Price\n, who purchased the brownstone in 2014 for $3.9 million and put it up for sale in April for $8.8 million. The listing agent was Elika Associates\u2019\nGea Elika\n.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nA nearly 4,000-square-foot sponsor unit at\nSlate Property Group\u2019s The Katharine\nat\n118 West 13th Street\nin Greenwich Village traded for $12.4 million, just over the asking price of $12.1 million.

        "content": "Continuing our \u201c\nEducating Zohran\n\u201d series\u2026\nToday, we offer more evidence that mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani\u2019s pledge to build affordable housing for $500,000 per unit (with union workers) is off by a factor of two.\nThe latest examples are the $150 million redevelopment of Parkway Hospital in Forest Hills, which will yield 145 units of affordable and senior housing, and New Destiny Housing\u2019s $57 million Bronx development with 72 units, including 43 for domestic violence survivors.\nThe Queens project at 70-35 113th Street, by Jeff Fox\u2019s Foxy Development and Selfhelp Realty Group, also includes space for a Jewish center, so we can\u2019t just divide the total cost by the unit count to get a per-unit cost. But clearly, it\u2019s a lot more than $500,000. The typical cost of nonunion-built affordable housing in the city is about $800,000 per unit.\nMamdani\u2019s union construction would cost more, if affordable housing developers actually built that way. Which they don\u2019t.\nAs is customary with affordable housing, funding for the Queens and Bronx developments was patched together over several years from a plethora of sources.\nFoxy got a $37.5 million construction loan from TD Bank, a $40.1 million permanent loan from\nCommunity Preservation Corporation\n, a $70.7 million loan from HPD\u2019s Senior Affordable Rental Apartments program, $18.24 million in federal HOME funds, and $3.625 million from state agency Homes and Community Renewal. Construction begins Wednesday.\nNew Destiny\u2019s project, which broke ground last week on Webster Avenue, includes $25 million from HPD\u2019s Supportive Housing Loan Program, $16 million in Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, and $9.7 million from the OTDA\u2019s Homeless Housing and Assistance Program.\nIf you\u2019re not up on your acronyms, OTDA is the state Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance. New Destiny also got help from the Corporation for Supportive Housing and Deutsche Bank\u2019s supportive housing arm.\nThis complicated array of funding sources, each of which takes time and comes with fees, is one reason affordable projects cost\nmore\nthan market-rate development.\nMamdani says he would simply issue $70 billion in bonds to pay for his housing. That would be simpler and more efficient, but not enough to cut per-unit costs in half. Regardless, a bond issuance of that size would require state approval, which is extremely unlikely.\nGov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s former counsel, Liz Fine, explained why in a\nrefreshingly honest op-ed\nlast week: \u201cThe government builds roads, bridges, public buildings, infrastructure, and even housing. But it is wildly expensive for the government to build housing and so at the end of the day, we need to rely on private developers.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nContrary to the common sentiment that rents never go down, in the nation\u2019s 50 largest metro areas, the median asking rent for units with two or fewer bedrooms dropped 2.2 percent year-over-year in August to $1,713, and is down 2.6 percent from the August 2022 peak, according to\nRealtor.com\n. That\u2019s 25 consecutive months of annual declines. Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Only 14 people own more land in the United States than\nStefan Soloviev\n, according to The Land Report\u2019s\nlatest ranking\n. Soloviev is a grain fanatic with a voracious appetite for farmland. His place on the list has little to do with the property he inherited from his father Sheldon Solow, a portfolio which includes office and multifamily buildings, as well as a vacant parcel just north of the U.N. building where he wants to build a casino-based project, Manhattan\u2019s\nlargest development site\n.\n\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 re-election chances remain slim, but super PAC Empower NYC has raised nearly $1.5 million to back his independent run, much from real estate developers with projects needing city approval, according to\nThe City\n. Donors include firms seeking rezonings, luxury condo approvals or lucrative city leases, with contributions ranging from $15,000 to $250,000.\n\u2014 The U.N. General Assembly comes to Manhattan next week, and with it comes some of the city\u2019s worst traffic. While the MTA could raise congestion pricing as a deterrent to driving, don\u2019t expect that, according to\nCrain\u2019s\n. Sources told the outlet that Gov. Kathy Hochul likely wouldn\u2019t let any toll hikes happen \u2014 especially before an election year.\n\u2014 \u201cFriends\u201d lovers, rejoice. A permanent Times Square location of the \u201990s-era sitcom\u2019s coffeehouse Central Perk is set to open permanently this fall after a series of pop-ups,\nGothamist\nreported. The cafe will feature the show\u2019s iconic orange couch and a menu designed by James Beard winner Tom Colicchio.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$18 million\nfor a 4,600-square-foot co-op unit at 1125 Fifth Avenue on the Upper East Side. Sabrina Saltiel with Douglas Elliman had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$6 million\nfor a 27,425-square-foot industrial property at 301 Walton Avenue in Mott Haven.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$15 million\nfor a 5,499-square-foot condominium unit at 37 Warren Street in Tribeca. Corcoran\u2019s Noble Black &amp; Partners has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 1,073,485-square-foot, 10-story detention center at 357 Southern Boulevard in the Bronx. Donald Henry of Urbahn Architects filed the permit on behalf of the New York City Department of Design and Construction.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "Rental apartments were harder to come by this summer in the wake of New York City\u2019s ban on broker fees.\nAcross the five boroughs, the number of rental listings fell in June, July and August compared to their year-ago totals, according to data provided by the Real Estate Board of New York. The trade group\u2019s analysis was based on all listings available on its residential listing service during the periods.\n\u201cThe FARE Act has created chaos and confusion in the residential rental market, is diminishing choice for tenants, increasing rents and costing the industry jobs,\u201d REBNY president James Whelan wrote in a statement. \u201cThis is bad policy, and it is only getting worse.\u201d\nInventory dropped 16 percent in June, the same month\nthe city implemented the FARE Act\nbarring landlords from charging tenants fees for agents they hired, according to REBNY\u2019s analysis.\nIn the months following the policy\u2019s enactment, the dip became even more pronounced. Inventory decreased 23 percent in July and 29 percent in August, according to data from the organization. As fewer apartments hit the market, prices rose on an annual basis in each of the three months, up 7 percent in June and July and 11 percent in August.\nHowever, the inventory problem is likely less dire than the trade group\u2019s analysis reflects. Other groups, such as data analytics platform UrbanDigs, have lamented that rental data has been\nharder to track\nwith fewer listings hitting the RLS. Other data sources, such as StreetEasy, capture a larger swatch of apartments and include citywide numbers that are, in some cases, more than three times the figures REBNY reported.\nData from StreetEasy also shows a decline in inventory across the city, though its metrics indicated a more gradual reduction, with inventory falling just 2 percent in June, 11 percent in July and 9 percent in August.\nManhattan logged the most substantial decrease, with inventory dipping 7 percent in June, 18 percent in July and 13 percent in August, according to data from StreetEasy. But apartment listings in Brooklyn and Queens remained much steadier, with both boroughs notching small upticks in June followed by modest declines between 2 percent and 5 percent in the following two months.\n\u201cThis was more about optics than it was about the actual impacts,\u201d Corcoran\u2019s chief operating officer Gary Malin said of the law, which he described as decreasing transparency in the market and making it harder for tenants to find apartments on their own. \u201cThey\u2019re taking the industry back to before the internet.\u201d\nTight market squeezes brokers, renters\nThough REBNY largely attributes the upset to the FARE Act, other factors are likely at play, especially in Manhattan, where competition for apartments was already tight, according to a\nreport from StreetEasy\npublished earlier this summer.\nWhile rent prices are on the rise, in part due to landlords attempting to offset the cost of broker fees, the same market constrictions contributing to the drop in inventory are also pushing prices higher. In New York City, the struggle with\nhousing affordability\nis a longstanding issue that predates the new legislation, and other laws, such as\nGood Cause Eviction\n, have a hand in the recent market.\nThe summer months are also typically the busiest times of year for the city\u2019s rental market, and the attention around the adoption of the FARE Act may have spurred even more activity than usual, according to\na report\nfrom Openigloo based on a survey of its users. The rate of lease renewals between June and August fell from 69 percent in 2024 to 59 percent in 2025.\n\u201cI think the FARE Act had a part to play,\u201d said Allia Mohamed, Openigloo\u2019s co-founder and CEO. \u201cRenters felt empowered and had more flexibility to enter the rental market.\u201d\n\nDespite higher rents, Openigloo\u2019s report found that tenants still saved money without the cost of the broker fee \u2014 about $1,300 per unit annually.\nREBNY sought to halt the FARE Act from taking effect ahead of its implementation day, though federal judges have repeatedly denied the trade group\u2019s request, including the\nlatest decision\nhanded down by an appeals court judge last month. REBNY is suing the city over the law.\nStill, brokers dealing in rentals are contending with the fallout while the law stays in place.\n\u201cOwners are getting squeezed, and brokers are working harder for their money,\u201d said Corcoran\u2019s Shloma Hecht. \u201cIt\u2019s competitive.\u201d\nThe policy has pushed landlords to negotiate with brokers, Hecht added, many of whom will agree to collect a smaller fee from property owners with large portfolios. The norm used to be about a month of rent, but now some agents are taking less than that, though how much less varies and, in part, coincides with the cost of the apartment.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re tough, and you say, \u2018I\u2019m only going to work for a month or nothing,\u2019 you could lose a big account,\u201d Hecht said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to go down the block and hire someone else.\u201d\nThe key to survival is pulling on existing relationships with landlords, who already trust in the value of their agents\u2019 services, Hecht said. However, winning new business has been a tougher sell.\n\u201cIt makes the pitch harder,\u201d Hecht said.\nCompass broker James Finelli said the FARE Act will hit new agents harder, who lack proven track records with property owners.\n\u201cPeople who have established businesses, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be severely impacted,\u201d said Finelli. \u201cIf [landlords] are going to elect to pay a fee, they\u2019re going to be more scrupulous on the person.\u201d\nBoth Finelli and Hecht agreed that those likely to absorb most of the law\u2019s impact are tenants, who are seeing asking rents go up even higher and who are having a tougher time finding available apartments. To access that inventory, some are hiring brokers and agreeing to pay a fee on top of paying an elevated asking rent.\nThe Agency\u2019s Evan Roth added that, at some point, something\u2019s gotta give.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pressure cooker kind of situation. Just how much can these renters take,\u201d Roth said. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before there\u2019s more of a shift back to the sales market.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Four rent-controlled cottages in Reseda would be razed to make way for a six-story, 95-unit apartment building by a multifamily developer who\u2019s begun to use the ED1 program in the San Fernando Valley.\nLos Angeles-based JZA Architecture submitted a pre-application filing to the Los Angeles City Planning department on behalf of developer Efi Meirson on Sept. 10.\nMeirson told\nThe Real Deal\nplans for the San Fernando Valley project will be altered due to new design, but declined to comment further until the tenants in the cottages have moved out early next year.\nIt\u2019s not clear if the developer will use ED1 on the Reseda, but he is seeking some density bonuses some affordable units. EDI requires 100 percent affordable housing.\nThe infill site, at 7040-46 Baird Avenue, is a 16,000-square-foot parcel near the corner of Reseda and Baird avenues. There are currently four small cottages on it, all built in the 1930s, according to the county assessor. Two of the homes have one bedroom and one bathroom and clock in at 576 square feet a piece. Two cottages comprise two bedrooms and one bathroom and each span 804 square feet.\n\nMeirson bought 7040-46 Baird Avenue in July for $875,000, according to the deed. He seeks regulatory relief and development bonuses from the city in exchange for including affordable housing units.\nThe Baird Avenue proposal now on file fits the same pattern as Meirson\u2019s two nearby projects, at 15931 West Victory Boulevard and 7112 North Baird Avenue, per city planning documents.\nThe former calls for demolishing five rental units and replacing it with a six-story building with 100 units that will be 100 percent affordable. The structure would span 68,000 square feet, JZA\u2019s website indicates.\nThe latter is slated to be a six-story, 34-unit building. Meirson is working with JZA on both of those applications.\nJeff Zbikowski, founder of JZA,\nnoted\nin early 2024 that a lot of the ED1 projects he was aware of were in South L.A., but ones were starting to \u201cpop up in nicer areas on the Westside or in the Valley and Reseda, some of these higher-resource areas, where they\u2019re more centered around hedging against nicer areas \u2014 providing mixed-income projects within those areas that are always going to be occupied.\u201d\n",

        "content": "In order to cover retirement checks as the city waits for property tax revenue to replenish its dwindling coffers, Chicago will lend cash to its pensions, avoiding asset sales.\nThe delayed collection stems from a computer issue.\nThe city advanced $28 million this month to the Firemen\u2019s Annuity &amp; Benefit Fund so it wouldn\u2019t need to dump stocks, bonds or other assets to cover retiree benefits, according to city finance officials. City of Chicago CFO Jill Jaworski told aldermen the city is monitoring the cash needs of all four pension funds \u2014 covering firefighters, police, laborers and municipal workers \u2014 and will lend as needed until Cook County\u2019s property tax mess is resolved, Bloomberg\nreported\n.\nThe issue stems from a\nbungled\ncomputer system overhaul at the county, which pushed back the second installment of property tax bills by weeks. Normally, about 55 percent of Chicago\u2019s $1.77 billion levy comes in during March, with the rest arriving in August. Roughly 80 percent of that levy flows directly into pensions, meaning delays hit the funds hard.\nThe computer system overhaul \u2014 work that was contracted to Texas-based Tyler Technologies \u2014 has amounted to years of missed deadlines on the project, meaning property tax bills had still not been mailed out for payments that should have come due June 30. Property owners have a month to pay once those bills are received, potentially meaning actual revenue won\u2019t fill county coffers until the end of October.\nCity Clerk Anna Valencia, who sits on the firefighter pension board, said that she\u2019s glad the city acted to avoid selling off assets, but she also pressed the county to spell out how and when it will fix the billing problem.\n\nChicago Public Schools is also\nsuffering\nfrom the delay, racking up penalties on late payments to its teachers\u2019 fund. By the end of last month, that delay already piled almost $2.5 million in interest owed on the school district\u2019s $247 million pension fund payment.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time City Hall has played banker for its pensions. In late 2023, the city advanced about $425 million in similar stopgap loans, and in 2022, then-Mayor Lori Lightfoot pushed more than $500 million forward when federal aid left the budget flush. That cushion is gone now. Mayor Brandon Johnson is\nstaring\ndown a $1.15 billion city budget deficit, dwindling reserves and growing pension costs as federal relief money dries up.\nThe firefighter fund illustrates the stakes. As of year-end 2023, it carried nearly $7.5 billion in long-term liabilities but just $1.8 billion in assets, a funded ratio of 23.7 percent. That\u2019s far below the national average of about 78 percent for large public pensions. Recent benefit hikes may push it lower still.\nThe city\u2019s loans\nbuy\ntime for now. But with Johnson\u2019s proposed $300 million property tax hike dead on arrival last year, and a state mandate to get pensions to 90 percent funded by 2055, the bills are only getting harder to juggle.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Vlad Doronin\u2019s OKO Group was hit with a lawsuit over its stalled 251-unit apartment project in downtown Fort Lauderdale.\nMore than 40 investors in OKO\u2019s planned 34-story One River tower say that the developer has failed to advance any \u201cmeaningful construction\u201d and is yet to secure a general contractor, three-plus years after obtaining a nearly $100 million construction loan to build the tower, according to the complaint.\nThe investors sued OKO Group, as well as FPR Investor, the entity in which investors purchased a membership interest, and FPR US 1, the sponsor manager of FPR Investor. London-based Cain International is a co-developer of One River, but wasn\u2019t named as a defendant in the suit.\nThe lawsuit, filed last month in Broward County Circuit Court, lists fraud and breach of contract counts.\nStarting in 2021, each investor put in $25,000 to $400,000 in the project by purchasing securities in FPR Investor, which targeted a $21 million minimum raise, according to the complaint. The investments were to be held in an escrow account with FPR US 1.\n\u201cFPR has been nothing more than a vehicle to raise money from investors and enrich defendants,\u201d investors allege in the suit, adding that their capital hasn\u2019t been returned to them.\nIn a statement, OKO denied the claims in the suit as \u201cfalse and without merit,\u201d and said it intends \u201cto defend vigorously against them in court.\u201d\nCain did not respond to a request for comment.\nIn 2022, OKO Group and Cain, led by Jonathan Goldstein, scored a\n$97.2 million\nconstruction loan for One River at 629 Southeast Fifth Avenue. Bank OZK was the senior lender and JVP Management provided the mezzanine debt.\n\nConstruction was expected to start in the summer of 2022, and be completed last September, according to an OKO news release announcing the financing in 2022.\nRecords show that the development entity took out two notices of commencement of work in 2022 on the site, one for excavation and one for piling. No other commencement notices were recorded.\nOKO Group had bought the site as part of its\n$63 million\npurchase of a larger 6.7-acre assemblage south of the New River in downtown Fort Lauderdale in 2020. One River was marketed as the first tower in a multi-phase development.\nAccording to the suit, some of the investors financially backed One River through\nCrowdStreet\n. The New York-based crowdfunding platform faced heavy criticism after real estate investor Elie Schwartz pleaded guilty this year to wire fraud tied to diverting nearly $63 million of investor funds meant for Atlanta and Miami Beach offices for his personal use.\nFor more than three years, OKO Group has given regular updates on One River, according to the lawsuit. Its first quarter report showed the firm is continuing the same work that it reported in past updates, the lawsuit says. This includes putting forth general contractor bids for price feedback, and continuing talks with general contractors and construction management firms over the site and pricing. Yet, OKO still hasn\u2019t secured an \u201cactionable\u201d guaranteed maximum price from a general contractor, according to the complaint and the first quarter report.\nOKO and Cain have partnered on other projects across South Florida. The pair completed the fully leased 57-story\n830 Brickell\noffice tower in Miami\u2019s Brickell last year. The building attracted many new-to-market companies that moved to South Florida in the past half decade.\nIn Palm Beach, OKO and Cain propose an\nAman-branded\ncondo complex with three five-story buildings. The project will replace the Ambassador Palm Beach Hotel &amp; Residences at 2730 South Ocean Boulevard and Edgewater at 2720 South Ocean Boulevard.\nThe lawsuit comes as South Florida\u2019s multifamily market has slowed compared with the boom of recent years. The influx of out-of-staters had prompted unprecedented apartment demand and rent growth, and developers seized on the bonanza by quickly building new projects.\nMore recently, the construction frenzy has led to an apartment supply overhang, resulting in slower lease-ups and rent growth. Asking rents are either flat or declining across South Florida submarkets. For the past year, developers have been\ncanceling or pausing\ntheir multifamily projects amid elevated interest rates and higher construction costs.\n",

Once the meeting was over, he stood up and chastised the committee members, aside from those appointed by the mayor and governor, who were the sole yes votes.\n\u201cWhat you did here today was a despicable display of cowardice, lack of leadership, lack of consideration for all the people who would benefit from this proposal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe met the standard, and then some.\u201d\nHe then quickly exited the meeting.\nThe no votes mean two Manhattan proposals remain. A CAC vote on Silverstein Properties\u2019 proposal is slated for later Wednesday.\n\nThe other Manhattan bid is Soloviev Group and Mohegan\u2019s $11 billion Freedom Plaza on Manhattan\u2019s East Side. The CAC tasked with reviewing that project is slated to vote on the proposal on Sept. 22. Five other bids also await CAC votes, which will determine if\nthe projects\nhead to the state Gaming Facility Location Board, which will award three casino licenses. The board is expected to do so by the end of the year.\nSL Green, which teamed up with Caesars Entertainment, Roc Nation and Live Nation, proposed converting its 2 million-square-foot office building at 1515 Broadway into a casino, 992-key hotel, restaurants and an entertainment venue.\nThe team also committed to $250 million in community investments, as well as allowing investors with as little as $500 to acquire equity in the project.\nSL Green\u2019s odds were lowered by the casino approval process itself. Members of the CAC were appointed by elected officials, including Sen. Liz Krueger, who made\nclear\nthat she did not support a casino in Manhattan. The project also faced fierce opposition from the Broadway League, an influential trade group that represents the city\u2019s theater industry, which argued that a casino would siphon from rather than complement Times Square businesses and entertainment venues.\nThe CACs that reviewed the remaining proposals must vote on their respective projects by Sept. 30.\nAhead of this key vote, some teams have continued to add perks to their proposals in an effort to make their projects more competitive. At its second public hearing, Soloviev increased the number of affordable housing units it will build from 513 to 600.\n",

Cervera Real Estate is leading sales and marketing for the project, which is 40 percent presold, Chudaitov confirmed.\n\nChudaitov said his target demographics for 72 Carlyle are locals, out-of-state buyers from feeder markets like California and New York, and investors.\u00a0 The project is intended to provide \u201cobtainable luxury\u201d for buyers interested in proximity to the beach (which is five blocks away), he said, \u201cThe price point is really the sweet spot in this market.\u201d\nElliman\u2019s Fredrik Eklund said he also anticipates the project appealing to location-focused locals, rather than international buyers who are more drawn to branded residences and supertalls. Eklund says North Beach is in the early stages of a luxury evolution.\n\u201cThis is like NoHo 10 years ago I would say,\u201d he said, referencing the once-overlooked Manhattan neighborhood.\nIn 2017, Miami Beach residents voted to increase density for developments in North Beach, setting the stage for a new wave of investment in the neighborhood. Lefferts\u2019 completion of 72 Park marked the first new condominium in\nNorth Beach\nin five years.\nAside from Lefferts\u2019 projects, the rezoning spurred developments like Northlink Capital\u2019s planned\n7200 Collins\n. The 12-story, 222-unit project is slated for 7200 Collins Avenue, on the former site of Denny\u2019s. Sales launched for the non-waterfront short-term rental-friendly condos in April, with prices starting at $600,000. In March, Constellation Group, Boschetti Group and Vietmar landed a $42.3 million construction loan for their planned\nElla Miami Beach\n. The 10-story, 103-unit non-waterfront short-term rental-friendly condo project at 6940 Abbott Avenue has prices starting at $500,000.\nOther projects in North Beach\u2019s pipeline include the Meruelo family and Terra\u2019s planned 120-unit condo and 150-room hotel project at the 3.8-acre oceanfront\nDeauville Beach Resort\nat 6701 Collins Avenue. Witkoff Group has also joined Alex Blavatnik and Sandor Scher on their stalled\nOcean Terrace\nproject on the site spanning 7409 to 7449 Collins Avenue and 7400 to 7450 Ocean Terrace, which includes a 20-story, 75-unit luxury condo.",

The project would have featured a 1,000-key Hyatt Hotel, as well as restaurants, bars and a 150-seat entertainment venue.\n\nThe developer also promised to fund the conversion of offices into 2,000 units of housing, in and around Community Board 4. The firm hasn\u2019t named specific properties, but noted at its first public hearing last month that it had identified 92 feasible sites and was planning to evaluate another 146. Of course, the firm would need to acquire properties before moving forward with conversion plans.\nLike SL Green\u2019s CAC, members of Silverstein\u2019s committee included appointees by elected officials who publicly rejected adding a casino in Manhattan, including Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal.\nSilverstein\u2019s team asked the CAC to delay the vote on Wednesday morning, citing that the committee sent \u201ca very significant request\u201d late Tuesday night. The team indicated that because they were not given adequate time to consider the request, the vote should be postponed. A spokesperson for the team said the late request \u201ctaints the CAC process.\u201d Angel Vasquez, who was appointed to the CAC by Gov. Kathy Hochul, agreed during the meeting that the vote should have been pushed.\nThe CAC, however, declined the request.",

        "content": "The former Vornado leasing executive accused of stealing more than $9 million from the firm allegedly created fake brokerages and burner accounts to bill the REIT for phony services over a 15-year period, according to federal prosecutors.\nJared Solomon\nwas arrested in December and charged by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York with stealing $9.5 million from his employer. The feds do not identify the company, but sources told\nThe Real Deal\nthat it is Vornado Realty Trust.\nAccording to the prosecutors, Solomon defrauded the company by creating fake brokerage companies named Margoux Media and Cobalt Advisors, and then submitting invoices to Vornado for work he claimed the companies had performed.\n\u201cThe defendant carried out his fraud scheme by using fake commercial real estate agreements \u2014 mainly fake broker agreements, among other types of agreements \u2014 and fake invoices that called for Victim Company-1 to issue checks and wire payments to one of three purported real estate broker companies,\u201d prosecutors wrote in court papers.\nThe third company is an actual brokerage, though prosecutors said the firm had no knowledge that Solomon was submitting invoices in its name.\nOn several fake agreements, Solomon allegedly copied and pasted a signature he had access to from an executive who did a bona fide licensing agreement with Vornado in 2015, and then claimed the executive was the chief financial officer of the fictitious Margoux Media.\n\nSolomon allegedly used fake email addresses and burner phone numbers to communicate with higher-ups at Vornado who had concerns about the payments. After the company made a $1.4 million payment to the Margoux account in 2019, Solomon allegedly used the money to buy a pricey Manhattan home.\n\u201cOnly one week later, the defendant, in turn, wired that amount, plus nearly $1 million in additional fraud proceeds that the defendant had previously obtained from Victim Company-1, to a real estate attorney to finance part of the purchase of a $4 million apartment located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan,\u201d prosecutors wrote.\nSolomon and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe Southern District attorney\u2019s office revealed the new details earlier this month when responding to Solomon\u2019s\nmotion to dismiss the charges\n. The prosecutors refuted his argument that the indictment was overly vague, stating that it met the required standard.\nProsecutors earlier this year told the judge overseeing the case that they had reached an agreement in principle for Solomon to change his not guilty plea. But since then, the defendant has changed attorneys and no formal agreement has been reached.\nIf found guilty, he faces up to 20 years in prison.\n",

        "content": "In the 1990s, fashion designers descended twice per year on Manhattan\u2019s Bryant Park to preview their upcoming collections to buyers and reporters in tents.\nIn the years since, New York Fashion Week has grown into an extensive public spectacle, staged against backdrops across the city with designers looking far and wide for backdrops to accentuate their seasonal visions.\nAlthough a runway show is often just a one-day affair, industry experts say the glitz and glamour of these events can bring visibility and cultural cache to a venue.\nThat\u2019s been the case for the Brooklyn Navy Yard, according to Joyce Duverce, senior vice president of impact and partnerships at the yard\u2019s development corporation.\nThe Navy Yard, which is 300 acres of industrial space, has hosted two fashion shows. In 2023, Bronx native Ralph Lauren turned a warehouse in the yard into a barn-style runway show, followed by a seated dinner under chandeliers (in attendance: JLo, Amanda Seyfried, Laura Dern, and Julianne Moore). In 2024, although not part of fashion week, Victoria\u2019s Secret hosted its runway show at the Yard\u2019s Duggal Greenhouse.\n\u201cIt brings the audience,\u201d Duverce said. \u201cWe have over 550 businesses here, but I don\u2019t think most people know that we have the capacity to host such large events.\u201d\nBeyond any promotion, big events have also helped bring business to the yard\u2019s tenants, including fabricators and lighting vendors, according to Duverce.\nAnd if a space is particularly noteworthy, an event can potentially lead to long-term leasing opportunities for a venue.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve definitely had people reach out to us directly after showing in a beautiful new space or a commercial building saying, \u2018Do you have the real estate agent to contact? Are they renting space in the building? Is there retail space available?\u2019\u201d said Robert Kalas, an executive producer at La Mode En Images, a production company.\nThe right fit\nNot every space can draw in fashion week clients for a runway show. First, there are basic conditions to be met.\n\u201cDesigners are always looking for a large space that\u2019s column-free, that no one has ever done a fashion show in before, that\u2019s located in Manhattan, that\u2019s ground floor with 800 amps, three-phase power,\u201d Kalas said.\nBeyond that, there\u2019s a drive for anything iconic to New York, anything industrial, and anything with views of the city. Some of the more offbeat fashion week venues have included the New York Public Library, the city\u2019s Surrogate\u2019s Court, and the NBA Player\u2019s Association practice facility.\nEvents have certainly shifted from just 34th Street, but still cluster in a handful of Manhattan neighborhoods \u2014 Soho, Chelsea, the Meatpacking District, the West Village and Tribeca \u2014 with an occasional foray out to Brooklyn. That\u2019s in part because shows are timed so closely together, leaving busy attendees with little time to travel.\n\nMoney to be made\nSome venues, like the Altman Building in Chelsea or 28 Liberty in the Financial District, run a year-round events business.\nFor those properties, fashion week brings significant exposure, letting patrons see the venue often in a new light. But the direct monetary impact of any single event may be limited. The Altman Building, where Sandy Liang and Private Policy have debuted their new work, charges a fixed rate for events, meaning no markup for fashion clients.\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s a celebration of life or a gala dinner, it really is the same price to host an event with us,\u201d said Ariel Swain, director of venue sales and marketing at the Altman Building. \u201cAny opportunity to showcase the space in a different light is an opportunity for us to have other events with the people who are in attendance.\u201d\nBut a business in short-term events can provide visibility and limit risk in an unpredictable real estate landscape, said Sara Altobelli, who runs marketing for Hush Venues.\nHush manages events at 28 Liberty\u2019s Halo space, where Carolina Herrera and Sandy Liang have both had models walk the runway, circling the venue\u2019s 1964 Noguchi sculpture garden. Hush partners exclusively with venues and then runs all the events in a space.\n\u201cFashion Week gets a lot of press and attention,\u201d Altobelli said. \u201cFrom a cultural aspect, it\u2019s an incredible angle to be part of this very New York thing that is Fashion Week.\u201d\nIf done right, the result can also be profitable. Karrie Goldberg, founder and CEO at The Kagency, partners directly with property owners and developers to score a calendar of shorter-term events, including runway shows. For the right venue, such a business can net up to three times the profits of a traditional retail lease, she said.\n\u201cIf you look at a 10,000-square-foot space that is fully finished \u2014 as in, it could be a raw space but you have all the base amenities \u2014 you could be paying anywhere from\n20 to 25 grand\nfor the day,\u201d she said.\nSome developers, Goldberg said, are happy to run that business year-round. But others use her agency to monetize time between more traditional tenants, giving access to their space for just 90 days.\nThough fashion houses occasionally reach out directly, much of the business is through public relations or production companies. The Kagency manages bookings for more than 500 venues across multiple cities and has run shows with multiple fashion clients, including Proenza Schouler at the Chelsea Factory, and Ulla Johnson at Powerhouse Arts, a former power plant in Gowanus.\nAlthough the marketing potential from a runway show can last, the show itself is fleeting.\n\u201cThe show is 15 minutes and then everything gets taken down,\u201d Altobelli said. \u201cIt all happens in a New York minute, and then it all goes away.\u201d\n",

The developers tapped Douglas Elliman to head sales at the project, though listings for the remaining sponsor units are no longer available on Streeteasy.\nNews of the plans for a bulk deal comes about a year after the developers scored a\n$120 million\ninventory loan from the Northwind Group. At the time, only 15 condos had sold at the project, which had a projected sellout of $340 million.\nA spokesperson for Shvo confirmed to\nThe Real Deal\nthat the investor group was mulling over a potential sale, following a\nsimilar strategy\nit employed at the Mandarin Oriental in Beverly Hills. Last year, the partnership sold 44 sponsor units at the project to Centurion Real Estate Partners after defaulting on a $200 million loan.\nIn a statement, Shvo\u2019s spokesperson pointed to the partnership\u2019s shift from focusing on residential development to office projects. \u201cWe are continuing to execute on that strategy with the potential bulk sale of remaining units at 685 5th Avenue,\u201d the spokesperson said.

The spokesperson added that the firm has invested $250 million in its office portfolio.\n\nSpokespeople for Eastdil and BVK declined Bloomberg\u2019s request for comment. A spokesperson for Deutsche Finance America did not immediately respond to the outlet\u2019s request.\nShvo and his partners bought 685 Fifth, formerly known as the Gucci building, for $135 million in 2018, three years after Shvo\u2019s first bid to buy the building fell through. The developers converted the office portion of the building into condos and added five floors of residences.\nSince sales of the fully-furnished units launched in December 2021, some units have traded for steep discounts, including a 3,400-square-foot apartment that sold last October for\n$17 million\n\u2014 significantly less than its last asking price of $22 million.\nBuyers at the Mandarin Oriental sued the development group and Shvo last year over allegations that construction on their $6 million one-bedroom condo did not line up with agreed-upon plans. A New York judge\ndismissed Shvo\nas an individual defendant in the suit, though the case is still pending.\nShvo has also been locked in a legal battle with the Core Club, a tenant at his 711 Fifth Avenue office building. The developer is in the\nprocess of evicting\nthe private members club, which sued him last year for $600 million. Last month, a New York judge ruled that the Core Club\nowed Shvo\n$1 million for defaulting on a loan.\n\u2014\nSheridan Wall\n",

        "content": "The Pierre has long stood as one of Manhattan\u2019s most gilded properties, a Versailles-inspired tower overlooking Central Park that housed everyone from Elizabeth Taylor to Coco Chanel.\nBut today, its aging elevators, shabby lobby and thinning roster of power players have set the stage for a bitter fight over its future \u2014 and at the center of it is Howard Lutnick.\nThe billionaire bond trader-turned-Trump Commerce Secretary owns the Pierre\u2019s penthouse, the building\u2019s largest apartment, and, by extension, the most co-op shares. According to the\nNew York Times\n, Lutnick pushed for a management shakeup two years ago, which led the board to ultimately hire Lutnick\u2019s own firm, Newmark, to advise on upgrades.\nThat pivot has spiraled into late-stage talks to sell the entire property at 795 Fifth Avenue for\nroughly $2 billion\n. The prospective deal would involve funding from the Khashoggi family and management by the Dorchester Collection, owned by the sultan of Brunei.\nIf approved, the sale could force out famous residents, including former Disney chief Michael Eisner, designer Tory Burch and media heiress Shari Redstone. Older owners in their 80s and 90s are furious, arguing they\u2019ve poured fortunes into renovations only to face eviction.\n\u201cTo find new accommodations and go through the trauma\u2026 would seriously affect my health, well-being and finances,\u201d longtime resident Tina Beriro, 84, wrote in an email obtained by the Times.\n\nLutnick, who hasn\u2019t lived in the penthouse he\nbought for $44 million\nin 2017, is distancing himself. A spokesperson for his department said he hasn\u2019t been involved in discussions for months and disclosed his conflicts before stepping away when Trump tapped him for his administration post.\nStill, the perception lingers that Newmark \u2014 poised to reap tens of millions in fees \u2014 set the deal in motion with Lutnick\u2019s blessing.\nThe outcome rests with the co-op\u2019s shareholders. Any sale requires approval from two-thirds of its shares, meaning Lutnick\u2019s oversized stake could prove decisive.\nSupporters frame the choice as cashing out at a profitable value versus footing astronomical assessments for long-delayed repairs. Opponents fear the loss of their homes to foreign owners with controversial ties.\nThe building\u2019s annual meeting is scheduled this week in the Pierre\u2019s Cotillion ballroom, where tempers will likely be raw. For a building long synonymous with luxury, the fight may determine whether its next chapter is one of restoration or exile.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Ian Bruce Eichner unloaded a Crown Heights\ndevelopment site\nat the center of a fierce zoning fight over shadows on the nearby Brooklyn Botanic Garden.\nIsaac Schwartz snapped up 970 Franklin Avenue for $54.3 million from Eichner\u2019s Continuum Company, according to a press release from JLL. The site is approved for a 10-story building with 355 units, of which 106 must be income-restricted.\nJLL\u2019s Andrew Scandalios, Ethan Stanton, Brendan Maddigan and Michael Mazzara arranged the sale.\nThe deal closes a tumultuous chapter for Continuum, which spent six years trying to push through rezonings that would have allowed larger multifamily projects on the site. The City Planning Commission scaled back Eichner\u2019s proposal to reduce shadows on the Garden.\nIn exchange for lower building heights, Council member Crystal Hudson let Continuum use the \u201cworkforce housing\u201d option in the city\u2019s Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program, which allowed for higher rents. Continuum also reduced the project\u2019s slope from its initial proposal, allowing more sunlight to reach the Garden\u2019s plant nursery and other areas. The Council approved the rezoning in November.\n\nThe road to consensus was long and rough. Eichner bought the site in 2017 for $33 million and had sought to build two 39-story towers with more than 1,500 apartments on a site that also included 960 Franklin Avenue. Roughly half of the units would have been set aside as affordable.\nThat bid never made it far, largely because of opposition from the Garden. The 960 Franklin site was then\nsold for $43 million\nin 2022 to Isaac Hager and Daryl Hagler, who in turn\nsold it to another developer\n, Yitzchok Schwartz, for\n$64 million\n. Schwartz plans 300 condo units across seven stories and 240,000 square feet, which he can build without political approval. (It\u2019s unclear whether Isaac Schwartz, who bought the adjacent 970 Franklin, is the same as this Yitzchok Shwartz, given Yitzchok is the Hebrew version of the name Isaac.)\nEichner pushed ahead with his remaining portion of the site and filed a new application to rezone it. The City Planning Commission shortened the towers to reduce the shadow impact to roughly half an hour per day, only to have Eichner deem that financially infeasible and\nthreaten to withdraw the application\n.\nBut he didn\u2019t, and now Schwartz will decide whether to proceed with Eichner\u2019s project. He could not immediately be reached for comment.\nA lawyer for Continuum declined to comment. Eichner did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "Chikoo Patel is drowning in debt.\nAmerican Express is the latest among a slew of lenders going after the embattled Chicago landlord in Cook County court, citing an unpaid credit card balance of over $63,000 following a missed minimum payment earlier this summer, according to a lawsuit filed last week.\nIt\u2019s a small dollar figure compared to the scale of his real estate collapse, which so far includes about $20 million in alleged debts or broken contracts across Illinois. But the new lawsuit shows how deep of a financial hole Patel has dug along his journey from up-and-coming investor to embattled defendant.\nPatel\u2019s profile was rising for years as a landlord and large-scale property manager in Chicago\u2019s South Side apartment market. Through his company,\nCKO Real Estate\n, he acquired and took on management for dozens of rental buildings in neighborhoods like South Shore. He brought in outside investors to help bankroll acquisitions, promising steady returns, while positioning himself as a key player in affordable housing. For a while, the strategy worked, until tenants, and then lenders, began to see the cracks.\nNow, at least one of Patel\u2019s frequent investment partners,\nShai Wolkowicki\n, is distancing himself from the financial turmoil.\n\u201cWe have not been associated with Chikoo Patel or CKO Real Estate since the beginning of February, when we parted ways. We have had new management in place since that time,\u201d Wolkowicki said in an email. He didn\u2019t provide an interview or respond to follow-up questions about the path to recovery for his investments or the size of his and CKO\u2019s real estate portfolio.\nPatel didn\u2019t return multiple requests for an interview.\nBuildings under CKO\u2019s control deteriorated, and financial woes followed. Wolkowicki has been named a defendant along with Patel in a $16 million lawsuit brought by Old National Bank over a Springfield multifamily deal that has sunk into distress. Wolkowicki also took over decision-making authority from Patel for Rockford properties as they were sold off earlier this year, according to a person familiar with the transactions.\n\nAt CKO\u2019s Chicago buildings, maintenance requests went unanswered. Mold, pests, broken heating systems and unsafe stairwells became common complaints. This spring, tenants organized and took their fight public. South Shore renters pleaded with city officials to be released from their leases, saying they felt scammed out of rent and deposits while Patel\u2019s team ignored basic repairs. One resident\ntold\nBlock Club that living in a CKO building felt like being \u201ctrapped,\u201d with no way out short of legal intervention.\nThe city eventually stepped in. In April, Chicago officials sued the owners of a South Shore courtyard building formerly managed by CKO, citing hazardous, slum-like conditions that posed an \u201cimminent threat\u201d to tenants. The city sought a court-appointed receiver to take over management and make repairs at 6952-58 South Paxton Avenue, where residents had gone without heat and hot water after CKO shuttered operations. Patel was summoned to court alongside the property owners and lenders, though he\ntold\nthe Triibe he hadn\u2019t been associated with the buildings for \u201csome months.\u201d\nAs property conditions worsened, Patel\u2019s financial troubles multiplied. Lender Itria Ventures, which provides small-businesses capital in exchange for pledging their future revenues toward repayment, sued CKO and Patel earlier this year seeking over $115,000 in alleged debt that fell into default, according to documents obtained by\nThe Real Deal\n. CKO and its affiliates borrowed $150,000 a year ago in exchange for pledging to repay $192,000, but began missing payments by February, public records show.\nItria dismissed its lawsuit but appears to have plans to re-file it; an attorney for securitized mortgage lenders appeared in the case on behalf of entities that own property set to be seized from borrowers with ties to Patel. The loans on those properties, at 541 East 80th and 8100 South May streets in Chicago, totaled over $1 million and were originated by locally based lender\nRenovo Financial\n.\nThe revelations painted a picture of a multifamily operator stretched thin, using other people\u2019s money to chase scale without the capacity to deliver.\nBy late summer, some of Patel\u2019s investors and lenders joined the revolt. Last month\nThe Real Deal\nreported that unpaid debts and broken promises soured once-supportive financial backers. Some had put significant capital into Patel\u2019s ventures expecting reliable returns; instead, they ended up damaging a relationship with the Department of Housing and Urban Development and got left holding buildings that were bleeding cash, with tenants unwilling to pay rent under unlivable conditions.\nWhether buyers step in with the capital and competence to stabilize the properties remains an open question. For lenders and investors, the cautionary tale is clear: chasing yield through lightly capitalized operators can backfire spectacularly.\n",

        "content": "A builder in Hinsdale will forge ahead with plans to demolish a 19th-century house over the objection of the village\u2019s Board of Trustees after the board voted this week to reject his demolition and construction application.\nIt\u2019s the latest example of\nhistoric preservation running up against the demands\nof luxury buyers in the high-end Chicago suburb, where preservationists have worked to keep historic and architecturally unique homes intact.\nThe house at 142 East First Street is alternatively called \u201cThe Hallmark House,\u201d because it was featured in Hallmark commercials in the 1970s, and the William Whitney House. It was built in 1869 and owned by William H. Whitney, an Illinois state representative who was responsible for Hinsdale\u2019s incorporation as a village in 1873.\nThe seven-member village board voted unanimously to deny the application to demolish the house and construct a new one on Tuesday. Hinsdale\u2019s historic preservation rules require homeowners to seek approval before tearing down or altering buildings in historic districts, but unless the property is designated as a landmark, its decisions are nonbinding. So the owner can continue with the development as long as it meets existing zoning rules.\nHinsdale\u2019s Historic Preservation Commission also unanimously rejected the application in an August meeting.\nRobert Cimala, president of Legacy Homes Cimala, which bought the property this year for $2.2 million, is planning a spec build on the site, intending to sell a new house in the $7 million range. The house was previously owned by the Grace Episcopal Church next door.\nCimala said he will continue with the demolition and construction plan, calling the Historic Preservation Commission\u2019s requests for remodeling the house unrealistic and criticizing the process required to begin construction.\n\u201cThey can\u2019t stop me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way this is set up, all that they can do is advise.\u201d\nThe home planned for the lot will be 6,840 square-feet, while the existing house is less than 4,000 square-feet. The planned house will have a four-car garage and rise four-and-a-half feet higher than the existing structure.\n\nCimala said demolition will begin sometime in the next few weeks and he expects construction to be finished next fall.\nCimala said he looked into remodeling the house when he first inspected it, and an architect told him it was not feasible. To renovate the house would require essentially tearing it down and rebuilding it, and the cost to renovate was unreasonable, he said. Members of a design review team in April suggested including the house\u2019s Italianate architecture in the design of the new house, but Cimala said there wasn\u2019t a market for that style.\n\u201cWhat they wanted me to do was basically tear down the house and build another one exactly like it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I told them I wasn\u2019t going to do that. That\u2019s not the style of home people want nowadays.\u201d\nBruce George, an architect with Charles Vincent George Architects, who is designing the new home, detailed the house\u2019s structural problems during Tuesday\u2019s meeting. He said he was involved in a remodeling of the house in 2005 through the church\u2019s maintenance committee. The church put $500,000 of work into the house, but he said a lot of things were left in poor shape because of the cost.\nThe house is part of the Robbins Park Historic District and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.\nFearing the loss of historic properties, Hinsdale created a\nHistoric Overlay District in 2022\nthat gave tax incentives to owners of historically significant homes who improved them while preserving traditional architecture instead of demolishing them.\nThe program has seen success, with about 100 homeowners applying for tax incentives to renovate their historic homes, Hinsdale Trustee Alexis Braden said. Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agent Mimi Collins\nbought and renovated a historic house\non South Park Avenue that she sold for $6 million last year.\nIn the North Shore\u2019s Glencoe, another luxury market with a history of teardowns, city officials are considering\nsimilar incentives to preserve historic buildings\n.\nSome preservation activists want Hinsdale to have more power to block demolitions of historic places, though. Landmark Illinois urged the village trustees to give the application process teeth and make it binding, in a letter read into the record on Tuesday by Trustee Luke Stifflear.\n\u201cHinsdale has seen an increase in approved demolitions over the past several years, endangering the character of the Robbins Park National Registered Historic District,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThe Historic Preservation Commission of Hinsdale urgently needs to revisit the village regulations to make it more difficult for historic assets to be demolished.\u201d",

        "content": "Paramount Group, the office landlord and real estate investment trust that has become synonymous with San Francisco, is coming under new ownership.\nNew York City-based Rithm Capital won a bidding war for Paramount Group, beating out interested parties including investment firm Blackstone and\noffice owners SL Green Realty\nand Vornado Realty Trust, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. Rithm was founded under Fortress Investment Group in 2013.\nRithm bought Paramount for $1.6 billion,\naccording\nto the outlet. As of yesterday, Paramount had a market capitalization of $1.7 billion. Green Street analysts predict the deal could be about $2 billion.\nNew York-based\nParamount\nput San Francisco at the heart of its premium office portfolio two decades ago. But as the pandemic wrecked the office market in San Francisco, Paramount has struggled to maintain ownership of several properties.\nAt its peak before the pandemic, Paramount owned six properties in San Francisco spanning more than 4.3 million square feet,\naccording\nto the San Francisco Standard. Paramount owns more than a dozen office towers in New York and San Francisco, including One Market Plaza, One Front Street, and 300 Mission Street.\nMonths before the sale, Paramount had been working to improve its finances by selling off parts of its San Francisco portfolio.\n\nParamount sold a 25 percent equity interest in the 640,000-square-foot One Front Street office building in May. That deal was completed in exchange for $40.5 million of short-term, fixed-rate financing. At the time of the sale, the building was valued at $255 million \u2014 more than half the $521 million price Paramount paid for it in 2016.\nThat same month, Paramount sold the 770,000-square-foot Market Center office building to Flynn Properties, headed by local franchise operator Greg Flynn. The firm\npurchased\nthe remainder of Paramount\u2019s debt for $177 million, marking a 76 percent discount on the purchase price.\nLast year, Paramount agreed to pay its lenders $125 million in order to push the loan maturity on One Market Plaza, the largest of Paramount\u2019s San Francisco holdings, to 2028. At One Front Street and One Market Plaza, Paramount executives were in the process of adding amenities to keep tenants in its offices and attract new ones.\nGoogle, Visa and law firm Morgan Lewis are exiting One Market Plaza. Meanwhile, Paramount\u2019s 55 Second Street building is being marketed for sale by lenders.\nParamount\u2019s remaining San Francisco portfolio was approximately 75 percent leased at the end of the second quarter.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Austin\u2019s South MoPac corridor is defying the city\u2019s otherwise sagging office market with vacancy rates less than half of those downtown.\nThe area \u2014 stretching along\nMoPac Expressway\nfrom Lady Bird Lake to Hwy 290 \u2014 posted a 13.8 percent vacancy rate in the second quarter, down from 18.1 percent three months earlier, according to Aquila Commercial. The Austin Business Journal\nreported\nthat the rate is far below the metro\u2019s average vacancy of roughly 17 percent and a sharp contrast to submarkets like East Austin, where nearly half of office space is available.\nThe pull is a mix of location, pricing and convenience, Aquila said. Rents and operating expenses are cheaper than downtown, parking is free and plentiful, and tenants can still\nreach\nthe city\u2019s core in minutes. The corridor feels like a tight micromarket, with no new construction in the pipeline, Aquila Principal Taylor McHargue told the outlet.\nThat swing is helped by displaced tenants. Last year the city bought One and Two Barton Skyway, removing nearly 400,000 square feet of office space from the market to consolidate Austin city departments. Companies like JE Dunn Construction, which will relocate to a 25,000-square-foot office at Terrace 6 next year, have pushed into the corridor\u2019s already limited 3.3 million-square-foot inventory.\n\nHPI Real Estate, which owns and occupies space at Barton Oaks Plaza II and III, has seen demand rise. Managing director Casey Casper told the outlet that companies weighing downtown often\nopt\nfor South MoPac instead, citing easier commutes for employees living south and west of the city. Executives who reside along the corridor also tilt decisions in its favor.\nThe relative affordability is another edge.\nDiscounted\nrents, lower expenses and no parking charges have made the corridor more competitive at a time when cost-conscious tenants are balking at downtown\u2019s 28 percent vacancy, McHargue said.\nThat demand is colliding with limited supply, creating one of the few Austin submarkets trending toward high occupancy. Available space totaled about 450,000 square feet at the end of the second quarter, including sublease offerings, Aquila reported.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The money was intended to pay the board\u2019s ground rent, facilities fees and payments in lieu of taxes.\nBut Milford allegedly sent funds to the wrong bank account.\nSomeone posing as an employee of BPCA sent Milford an email to wire the funds to TD Bank instead of Bank of New York Mellon, the bank that handled the board\u2019s account.\nThe email came from an email address of @bpca-ny.com as opposed to @bcpa-ny.gov.\n\nThe board alleges Milford performed \u201cno diligence and slavishly obeyed the fraudster\u2019s new set of wire instructions, wiring away $1.3 million of the board\u2019s money to the cyber thieves without so much as a phone call confirmation from a known BPCA employee, email verification, or second thought,\u201d according to the complaint.\nThe board\u2019s funds never arrived at BPCA, resulting in a default. When the agency flagged the unpaid debt days later, the board alleges in its lawsuit that Milford buried \u201cits head in the sand\u201d and neglected to inform the board about the issues.\nThe board says that Milford has neither reimbursed the funds nor settled the board\u2019s debts with BPCA. Residents now face unpaid bills with interest and penalties accruing, according to the lawsuit.\nThe board claims Milford failed to perform any internal or external cybersecurity audits or follow the recommendations of those audits.\n\u201cWith bank and wire fraud so prevalent, the Board reasonably expected Milford to maintain industry-standard safeguards to detect and prevent such schemes,\u201d said Terrence and Darren Oved of Oved &amp; Oved. \u201cMilford\u2019s failure to do so caused our client significant harm \u2014 a failure we are determined to rectify.\u201d\nMilford Entities owns three buildings in Battery Park City and manages six other buildings, collecting fees from over 2,000 units.\nMilford did not return a request to comment.\n",

Soon after Harris forked over the cash, Harris alleges $11.7 million was transferred to Dun &amp; Dun LLC, a managing entity controlled by St. John.\n\u201cMr. Wiles has not received a single penny in return for that investment, and, indeed, respondents have not even started developing or building the project,\u201d the filing says, according to the Post. Lawyers for Harris went on to describe the deal as \u201cat best, a complete boondoggle, and, at worst, a complete fraud\u201d and noted that Harris received \u201cscant (and sometimes contradictory) information\u201d when asking for updates about the project.\nHarris\u2019 legal team alleges that the $10 million loan was due to be repaid with interest by Jan. 31 of this year but remains outstanding nearly nine months later, according to the Post. In the meantime, an agreement Harris secured via arbitration prevents project funds from being dissipated while the court proceedings are ongoing.\n\nLast year, the project at 6767 West Sunset Boulevard shifted its focus to residential housing, with the planned development comprising two towers with 750 units, including 90 set aside for low-income residents. The property would also feature retail and creative spaces.\nIn response to the legal action, a lawyer for St. John said Harris \u201cactively pursued this development opportunity,\u201d attorney Sasha Frid\ntold\nVariety.\n\u201cUnhappy with the pace of the project, he chose to pursue private arbitration to assert his discontent,\u201d Frid said. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that due to interest rates and other market factors real estate projects are taking longer to build. But the development is very much viable and expected to have a [more than] $900 million valuation when completed. Mr. St. John denies any wrongdoing.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

They secured an additional $40 million mortgage from Peruvian firm Core Capital, led by CEO Luis Marcelo Indacochea, the release shows.

The dispute surfaced at a Chicago City Hall hearing on whether to landmark the 41-story Art Deco tower, a key step in unlocking subsidies for the project to turn 29 floors of vacant Loop offices into apartments.\nThe hotel occupies floors three through 10. Blackstone and special servicer CWCapital Asset Management, argued an easement agreement bars either side from rezoning without consent. Their attorney warned landmarking and rezoning could \u201cinvite litigation\u201d that would stall the project further.\nA venture\nled\nby Gabriel Martinez\u2019s Chicago-based Primera Group and investor Marc Calabria bought floors 11 through 40 last year. The buyers paid $11 million, an anonymous source told the outlet. That would be $33 per square foot. They are seeking to\nturn\nthe office space into 400 apartments with the help of $68 million in TIF money through the LaSalle Street Reimagined program, which former Mayor Lori Lightfoot launched in 2022 to bring more foot traffic to the city\u2019s center post-pandemic.\nThe city tweaked its zoning rules in July to allow aldermen to back landmarked buildings for rezoning even if not all owners agree, a move Blackstone\u2019s lawyer blasted as designed to cut the hotel out. Primera\u2019s lawyers countered in a letter that the hotel owners had ample time to weigh in and have \u201crepeatedly failed to participate meaningfully.\u201d\n\nThe battle adds another layer of drama to one of the marquee projects in Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s push to revive LaSalle Street Reimagined. Six conversions have been greenlit by his administration, totaling more than 1,800 units and $317 million in subsidies. The Clark Adams Building plan is among the largest.\nThat conversion was already facing a separate $15 million lawsuit from developers Celadon Partners and Blackwood Group, who claim Primera and Calabria stole their proposal. Celadon and Blackwood contend their\nproposal\nthat was short-listed in 2023 bears too much resemblance to the Primera and Calabria plans. That plan\ncalled\nfor 247 residential units and sought $60 million in tax increment financing.\nThe building was previously owned by a venture led by Chicago investor Musa Tadros, who defaulted on a $29 million loan used to refinance it in 2016.\nOriginally called the Bankers Building, the 1927 Burnham-designed tower has cycled through various uses. Landmarking would unlock $24 million in historic tax credits and help finance the conversion alongside developer equity and $77 million in debt.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Houston real estate investor and reality TV personality Washington Ho is in the middle of a messy courtroom fight with the former CEO of his brokerage, White House Global Properties.\nChristy Huckaby, who was hired in January 2024 to run the firm, sued last September alleging Ho, current CEO Angelica Smart and the company lured her with false promises, failed to pay her salary, withheld commissions and damaged her reputation, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n. She\u2019s seeking between $250,000 and $1 million in damages.\nHuckaby claims she was promised $10,000 a month for six months but received only $21,500, and that Ho and Smart withheld $170,000 in sales commissions. She also alleges she lost out on a nearly $276,000 commission tied to a $4.6 million listing for ex-Houston Rockets star Steve Francis, which she says Ho and Smart improperly took over.\nBeyond the money, Huckaby accuses the pair of defamation, making inappropriate sexual comments and dangling the prospect of a reality TV role \u2014 a spinoff of Ho\u2019s HBO Max show\n\u201cHouse of Ho\u201d\n\u2014 that never materialized.\nHo and Smart countersued, denying her claims and accusing Huckaby of breach of fiduciary duty. Their filing alleges Huckaby crippled the brokerage by taking 20 agents with her when she left, including her 13-person real estate team The Closers \u2014 Ho brought on her team along with the CEO hire \u2014 and by shutting down the firm\u2019s website. They also claim Huckaby attempted to blackmail them for $500,000 with what they described as damaging personal material.\n\nThe fallout extends beyond the principals. Nicole Lopez, White House\u2019s former COO, followed Huckaby out the door just two months into the job. Court documents show Huckaby released Lopez from a noncompete, enabling her move to Huckaby\u2019s team. Lopez has since joined Corcoran Genesis and previously told the outlet she left White House due to a \u201cvery chaotic environment.\u201d\nNeither Huckaby nor her attorney responded to requests from the outlet for comment. Ho declined to comment.\nHo launched White House with Smart in late 2023 after leaving eXp Realty, a move\ndue\nin part to disagreements over its commission structure. Ho pitched the firm as a new kind of brokerage with fair commissions and a focus on investment. Instead, less than a year later, it became entangled in dueling lawsuits with its founding leadership. A motion for a jury trial is set for October, where both sides are seeking damages.\nEarlier this year, the firm expanded\nbeyond\nHouston with a\nforay\ninto Austin, and announced plans to hire 30 to 50 agents over the next few years. The brokerage tends toward luxury listings, but it intends to represent all sectors of the Austin market, including lower-cost residential, commercial, industrial and development properties.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "And then there were six.\nTwo Manhattan casino proposals on Wednesday were eliminated from the state\u2019s casino licensing competition. Six others await votes that will determine if they compete in the final round.\nTwo Community Advisory Committees rejected\nSL Green Realty\nand\nSilverstein Properties\n\u2019 respective casino proposals, both with a vote of 4-2 against.\nAfter the vote, SL Green CEO Marc Holliday, who was seated in the front row, did not sashay away before taking a parting shot.\n\u201cWhat you did here today was a despicable display of cowardice, lack of leadership, lack of consideration for all the people who would benefit from this proposal,\u201d he said as the committee members exited the room.\n\u201cThe only one with courage to stand up was the governor and mayoral appointees, and everybody else runs and hides,\u201d he continued, referring to the sole yes votes.\n\u201cThe benefits you\u2019ve denied this community and this city and state, you have to live with that history forever,\u201d he said, before leaving.\nIt was a rare example of an emotional, in-the-moment reaction from a CEO whose statements usually get filtered through press relations. It is nice to have real-life humans react and comment on things! Sadly, I was turned down for a follow-up interview, but the casino team sent over a diplomatic statement lamenting all the benefits Times Square is losing without their casino.\nThis whole approval process is somewhat unusual. The state\u2019s Gaming Facility Location Board is supposed to assess the casino proposals based on several specific metrics. But the committees tasked with culling the competition were given much broader criteria for considering whether these proposals should even be presented to the board.\nThe CACs were instructed to \u201cissue a finding either establishing public support approving or disapproving the application.\u201d But there doesn\u2019t seem to be a uniform metric for establishing support or lack thereof, aside from the two public hearings held by each CAC on the casino proposals.\nI asked Assembly member Tony Simone if there was a consistent way of measuring public sentiment around these proposals.\n\u201cWe clearly look at the folks, the families who live in the district first. And overwhelmingly they were opposed to having these casinos in the district,\u201d he said.\nThe members of these CACs, however, voted pretty much as expected, based on the elected officials who appointed them. Does this mean the fates of the proposals were set from the beginning of the CAC process? We may never know. Elected officials would of course say no.\n\u201cThis is not a decision I took lightly,\u201d Council member Erik Bottcher said in a statement, referring to his decision to instruct his appointees to vote against both proposals. \u201cAll economic development opportunities deserve strong consideration.\u201d\nMore than a year before the vote, Simone, whose appointee Matthew Tighe sat on both the SL Green and Silverstein CACs, had said he was \u201c\nphilosophically opposed\n\u201d to a casino on Manhattan\u2019s west side, though he was referring to Related Companies\u2019 Hudson Yards proposal. Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Sen. Liz Krueger, who both appointed Richard Gottfried to represent them on the Silverstein and SL Green proposals, respectively, were also vocal about their opposition to casinos in Manhattan.\nBottcher and Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine opposed Related\u2019s casino plans, which the developer abandoned in May.\n\nAdding to the intrigue around this process: Silverstein Properties COO Dino Fusco said the CAC considering its application sent the casino team a last-minute (Tuesday night) request to add $1 billion worth of housing to their proposal. Unsurprisingly, Silverstein didn\u2019t agree to that \u2014 such a promise would have been dubious given the lack of time to figure out where this housing would go and how the firm would pay for it. The Department of Housing Preservation and Development apparently is responsible for this request, hoping that the CAC would delay the vote and give Silverstein more time to consider it, according to a source familiar with the talks. Simone indicated that such a promise likely wouldn\u2019t have swayed the CAC anyway.\nSome of the remaining proposals awaiting a CAC vote will need, to belabor the \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d references, to lip-sync for their lives. As today certainly proves, getting the necessary \u201cyes\u201d votes will be a challenge.\nLike the two rejected casinos, the remaining Manhattan proposal, pitched by Soloviev Group, is at the mercy of a CAC that includes members appointed by casino-naysayers. But when I spoke to Soloviev COO Michael Hershman last week, he said he was \u201cfeeling pretty positive\u201d about his team\u2019s chances. That vote is scheduled for Sept. 22, according to Hershman. The remaining votes have not yet been publicly announced.\n\u201cDespite the defeat today of two formidable applicants, we remain confident that one license should be awarded in Manhattan,\u201d Hershman said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cAttracting more tourists than any other borough, the city should have a fully integrated resort that is fitting of its position as the global capital of the world.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat will become of the SL Green and Silverstein properties now that the companies\u2019 casino dreams have been dashed? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Continuum sold its development site at 970 Franklin Avenue in Crown Heights for $54.3 million,\nmy colleague Elizabeth Cryan reports\n. The sale follows a tortuous rezoning fight over the site.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Zohran Mamdani and Brad Lander\u2019s cross endorsement during the mayoral primary was seen as a \u201cprogressive bromance\u201d, but behind the scenes, cracks are allegedly forming,\nGothamist\nreports. Lander had been signalling that he expected a top role in a potential Mamdani administration, but Mamdani shut down the speculation, telling Lander he had not yet made any personnel decisions.\n\u2014\u00a0A new City Council bill would ban fluoride in NYC\u2019s drinking water, a position aligned with U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement, according to\nCity and State\n. The bill\u2019s sponsor, Council member Jim Gennaro, said that while he\u2019s friends with RFK Jr., he did not suggest introducing the legislation.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$8.2 million\nfor a 3,038-square-foot townhouse at 262 West 12th Street in the West Village.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$19.6 million\nfor a portfolio of nine apartment buildings, including 632-644 Wales Avenue, 785-795 East 151st Street and 786-792 152nd Street in Woodstock. The portfolio included 209 residential units and is 163,428 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$21 million\nfor a 4,183-square-foot condominium unit at 111 West 57th Street in Midtown. Nikki Field and Benjamin Pofcher with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty have the listing.\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "Lenders are continuing their legal assault on Charles Cohen\u2019s properties, now in Westchester.\nCohen\u2019s office campus in White Plains was hit with a foreclosure case last month, with the lender demanding $66 million. The billionaire was named as a defendant in the suit because he signed a guaranty agreement connected to the loan.\nCohen Brothers Realty Corp. bought the property at 333 Westchester Avenue in 1998 for $25 million, according to contemporary reporting from\nthe New York Times\n. In 2004, an entity connected to the company took out $77 million in loans for the property.\nCohen served as a limited guarantor on the loan, pledging to cover some of the borrower\u2019s obligations in the event of fraud, environmental issues or other negative conduct.\nThe borrower defaulted on the loan by failing to make monthly payments in the summer and fall of 2024, failing to pay off the loan by its November maturity debt, and letting about $1.4 million in utilities debt accrue, according to the complaint. Two of the commercial condos in the complex are occupied and together pay a total of about $32,200 per month, the lender alleges.\nThe plaintiff argues in the complaint that Cohen is liable for any loan principal that remains unpaid after a potential sale of the property, although it does not reference any events triggering Cohen\u2019s guaranty.\nDavid L\u00f3pez, general counsel for Cohen Brothers Realty, said no events have triggered the guaranty and the foreclosure is related to a maturity default.\n\n\u201cWe are in dialogue with the lender and continue working with the lender to either refinance or restructure the loan,\u201d L\u00f3pez said via email. \u201cWe are optimistic that this will be worked out in due course.\u201d\nThe property was originally constructed as the headquarters for General Foods Corp., according to the Cohen Brothers\u2019 Realty website. The 39-acre office campus is a five-minute drive from the White Plains Metro North station and has a fitness center, basketball court, volleyball court, and free shuttle to the train, according to the website.\nIt\u2019s one of several suits Cohen and his company are dealing with. In July, a lender won a summary judgement on Cohen Brothers\u2019 750 Lexington Avenue, sending the building to foreclosure.\nLender Fortress Credit Corp. is also agitating to collect $187 million from Cohen personally after a court entered a judgement against him last year. The fight has pushed Cohen to try to sell his buildings. Last month he closed on the sale of 623 Fifth Avenue to Vornado, resulting in a $30 million payment to Fortress, according to court documents.\nHe has also agreed to sell 3 East 54th Street for $188 million to an unnamed buyer, according to court documents.\nForbes has estimated Cohen\u2019s net worth at $1.6 billion, down from $3.7 billion at its peak.\n",

        "content": "District Brew Yards, the concept that gave multiple breweries a shared taproom and production facility, is headed for last call.\nOwner Steve Soble is prepared to close the Near West Side flagship at 417 North Ashland Avenue as well as a suburban outpost at 700 North Milwaukee Avenue in Wheeling. CBRE was tapped to market the 17,300-square-foot Chicago building and the 11,900-square-foot Wheeling property, which carry asking prices of $4.5 million and $3.6 million, respectively, CoStar\nreported\n. That\u2019s about $260 per square foot for the Chicago facility and $302 per square foot for the one in Wheeling.\nThe Chicago location, which opened in 2019, will stay open temporarily while CBRE fields offers. The Wheeling site, which debuted in 2022, will close Sept. 28. They are being pitched as turnkey opportunities for brewers or restaurateurs. However, the Ashland property, sitting near Fulton Market and the\nplanned\n$10 billion 1901 Project from the Bulls and Blackhawks owners, could be ripe for larger redevelopment.\nDistrict Brew Yards\u2019 exit is part of a broader shakeout in\ncraft beer\nnationally. For the first time since 2005, more breweries\nclosed\nthan\nopened\nin the U.S. last year, leaving 9,796 still operating, according to the Brewers Association. Chicago has seen its share of retrenchment: Metropolitan Brewing folded, Goose Island\nclosed\nits Clybourn brewpub in favor of an outpost at the Salt Shed, and Revolution Brewing consolidated into Avondale.\n\nSoble, 61, said after decades in food, beverage and brewing \u2014 including Burnt City Brewing, one of the four labels inside Brew Yards \u2014 he\u2019s ready to step aside.\n\u201cIt\u2019s either time to dig in and alter the concept or let someone younger step in,\u201d Soble told the outlet. \u201cWe see the writing on the wall that it\u2019s going to be difficult to continue to do this.\u201d\nOther breweries sharing the facilities include Around the Bend, Twisted Hippo and Casa Humilde. The model was born out of Soble\u2019s observation that food halls like Revival in the Loop had traction, but few existed for craft beer.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

That\u2019s what Liv Development has planned for McKinney, the site of its next North Texas apartment project.\nThe Birmingham, Alabama-based developer estimates the 205-unit apartment complex, named Livano McKinney, will cost $40 million, or about $195,000 per unit, according to a state filing that is subject to change. The developer aims to start construction in December and complete the project at the end of July 2027.\nThe 302,000-square-foot development, at the intersection of Alma Rd and Silverado Trail, will feature apartments and townhomes surrounding a clubhouse. The site is about 8 miles from downtown McKinney, a fast-growing suburb about 33 miles north of Dallas. Its population has increased almost 10 percent to 227,000 since 2020.\nMultifamily developers in North Texas have dramatically pulled back on apartment building since interest rates caused development costs to balloon, and a historic number of deliveries resulted in declining rental rates and occupancy levels\n\nDallas-Fort Worth rents decreased 1.5 percent over the 12 months ending in May, according to Yardi Matrix. The Metroplex\u2019s occupancy rate of 92.6 percent put it at third-lowest among the country\u2019s 30 largest cities.\nIndustry experts predict the slowdown in development will give the market some momentum and push rents into the black by the end of this year or next. Operators like Liv Development are planning to time project deliveries with that anticipated rent-rate upswing.\nRobb Crumpton founded Liv Development as Red Mountain Development in 2006. The company has three other Texas apartment buildings in its portfolio \u2014 Livano Kemah, at 800 FM 518 in Galveston County; Livano Pflugerville, at 3301 E. Pecan Street; and Livano Prosper, 400 West Fifth Street.\n",

Area median income in Broward was $81,488 in 2024, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\nFrom 2018 to 2021, Moderno affiliates assembled the ArtHaus development site at 500, 510, 512 and 514 Southwest Third Avenue and at 501 and 503 Southwest Second Avenue in\nFort Lauderdale,\naccording to property records. Moderno Development Group is led by Doron Broman, founder and CEO, and Eyal Sapir, partner and director of real estate development.\nDesigned by Dorsky + Yue Architecture, ArtHaus would have a seven-story podium parking garage with 315 spaces, and an eighth-floor amenity deck with a pool, lounge and co-working space. The mixed-use building also would have nearly 4,700 square feet of commercial space.\n\nArtHaus is smaller than an earlier version of a planned multifamily development, which had a different name,\n500 Art Lofts\n. In the spring of 2024, Moderno and another developer, Aventura-based 75Invest Group, were planning the development as a 27-story rental building with 290 apartments, including 71\nworkforce housing\nunits.\nThe developers also had previously planned to advance the larger version of the development under the state\u2019s\nLive Local Act\n, which allows municipal administrative approval of a multifamily development without a city commission review, if the development includes workforce or affordable housing units with below-market rents.\nThe Fort Lauderdale City Commission voted unanimously Tuesday night to approve the site plan for 26-story, 265-unit ArtHaus development.\nWhether 75Invest Group is developing ArtHaus together with Moderno Development Group is unclear. Neither company responded to requests for comment.\nModerno and Gaia Real Estate Holdings launched the first $150 million phase of a fund called\nMILAS\nto purchase and renovate or rebuild about 400 single-family homes and townhouses in Miami\u2019s urban core.\nThe firms plan to rent out the acquired properties for a monthly range of $4,000 to $7,000, focusing on areas with limited new supply.

Depending on the finalized designs, the redevelopment could grow even more expensive.\n\u201cOur new regional headquarters in New York is a bold investment we are making in the Americas,\u201d Barclays executive Richard Haworth said in a memo to staff. Chief Executive Officer CS Venkatakrishnan added that the firm\u2019s \u201cpresence in New York and the Americas is critical to the bank\u2019s strategy as the investment bank delivers on its ambitions.\u201d\nBarclays plans to update its trading floors, as well as the technology used by the 12,000 staffers who work at the New York HQ, mostly in the investment bank division. The renovation will also bring various amenities online, though specifics weren\u2019t disclosed.\n\nBarclays assumed control of the 1-million-square-foot, 32-story office tower after taking over Lehman Brothers\u2019 North American operations 17 years ago.\nBanks are leading the charge of revamping Manhattan\u2019s office environment. Citigroup completed what was then the largest private-sector single-occupant renovation in New York City\u2019s history in Tribeca in 2020.\nAnd employees recently began occupying JPMorgan Chase\u2019s\n1,400-foot-tall behemoth\nat 270 Park Avenue, which is expected to ultimately house more than 14,000 employees.\nBanks aren\u2019t only about owning their spaces, either.

        "content": "Eliazer Tauber had a no good, very bad summer.\nThe New York-based investor was recently hit with a second round of foreclosure filings against several multifamily properties he owns on Chicago\u2019s South Side. The new lawsuits bring the total number of Chicago real estate loan default complaints brought against him to 16 since June.\nThe filings come at a time when\nseveral other landlords\nacross Chicago\u2019s South and West side neighborhoods are facing foreclosures on multifamily properties that have been flipped multiple times in short succession.\nThe Real Deal\nreported on the first nine foreclosures against Tauber\nearlier this summer\n. All of the properties involved were purchased for far more than appraised values set by property tax officials.\nAmong the latest batch of filings is a $1 million foreclosure of a 9-unit property at 1003 West 58th Street that sheds new light on Tauber\u2019s involvement with\nembattled attorney Mark Nussbaum\n.\nMap of Chicago Foreclosures against Eliazer Tauber\nNussbaum, who shut down his law firm in January, is under indictment in New York for grand larceny for allegedly bilking investors out of at least $15 million in escrow deposits. Nussbaum has pleaded not guilty.\nHe and Tauber secured a $1 million loan on the West 58th Street property even though it was worth just $400,000 three years ago and hasn\u2019t undergone any major renovations, permitting records show.\nHere\u2019s a timeline of how they did it:\nMarch 30, 2022:\nLakewood, New Jersey\n-based CMP Trading, which\nhas been involved with Nussbaum\non other transactions, bought the South Side property for $405,000. The 9-unit, 1920s-era brick apartment building is located in the Englewood neighborhood where mid-size multifamily sales rarely break $100,000 per unit and single family homes are listed for less than $200,000.\nApril 8, 2022:\nAbout a week after buying it, CMP sold the building to an LLC controlled by Ascher Berkowitz for $580,000. Berkowitz took out a 30-year, $430,000 mortgage from an entity called Commercial Lender LLC to fund the purchase.\nFebruary 27, 2023:\nSome portion of Berkowitz\u2019s LLC was transferred to a new owner for $375,000, though details are scant.\nFebruary 28, 2023:\nAn entity controlled by Nussbaum bought the West 58th Street property for $820,000 and took out a $565,000 mortgage against it from Accolend.\nAccolend is a Teaneck, New Jersey-based lender that has worked with Nussbaum on other Chicago deals and has sold some of its debt off to an affiliate of Athene Annuity and Life Company.\n\nApril 25, 2024:\nA Nussbaum-led entity took out a new $1.045 million loan on the property from Sharestates, a Great Neck, New York-based crowdfunding platform that Nussbaum has worked with in the past. Eli Tauber signed the mortgage documents.\nMay 8, 2024:\nNussbaum paid off the $565,000 Accolend loan, according to a publicly recorded mortgage release.\nSeptember 10, 2025:\nWilmington Trust, acting as a trustee of the $1 million loan originated by Sharestates, filed a foreclosure complaint, also listing Sharestates as a defendant. The filing states that the Nussbaum and Tauber entity has not made monthly payments since February.\nThe bigger picture\nThe 16 foreclosures filed against Tauber this summer all apply to properties he bought between February 2023 and May 2024, and total nearly $10 million in unpaid debts.\nBesides the West 58th Street building, the other properties facing foreclosure have only traded hands among the network of East Coast investors once. But all of them sold for prices well above their publicly appraised value.\nTauber and Nussbaum\u2019s deals raise questions about the purpose of the transactions and whether properties were sold in order to obtain larger loans without any money changing hands.\nTauber has signed multiple loans on behalf of Nussbaum\u2019s entities. He and his son Jacob Tauber have been Nussbaum\u2019s known deal partners on Chicago multifamily properties through a company called Straightline Management, according to people familiar with the investors.\nWhile Nussbaum has served real estate clients as a lawyer, he also became a fast-acting lender to help multifamily buyers show they had funds to close transactions.\nHe began buying Chicago apartment buildings that were in rough shape as a white knight, saving the previous owners from facing foreclosures or city building code violation cases.\n\u201cFor those properties in which he does hold some indirect interest, Mr. Nussbaum assumed control from prior, struggling owners and cured pre-existing violations,\u201d Nussbaum\u2019s attorney, Ethan Kobre of Schwartz Sladkus Reich Greenberg Atlas, previously told TRD.\nBut investors following similar playbooks have recently\nfaced scrutiny\nand\neven federal investigations\n.\nFederal agencies have discovered a pervasive scheme where investors buy a property and quickly sell it to a straw buyer at a higher price. The inflated price allows the owners to obtain a bigger loan, often from Fannie or Freddie, than they otherwise would have received. The goal is to\nbuy real estate with no money down\n.\nSome conspirators, including Eli and Aron Puretz, Moshe Silber, Fred Schulman and Boruch Drillman, have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud. More indictments are expected to come. Many of the players at the center of the DOJ\u2019s investigation have ties to Lakewood, New Jersey.\nThe DOJ has not brought any criminal charges or allegations of wrongdoing against Nussbaum and there is no known investigation into Nussbaum\u2019s transactions in Chicago.",

Austin has 6.3 months inventory, and Travis County has 6.9, according to Unlock MLS.\nHowever, sales and volume are up in the city. Total dollar volume increased year over year to almost $700 million, a 4.3 percent bump.\nPending sales were also up year over year in the Austin metro in August for the fourth month in a row. The Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos area closed out the month with 2,669 contracts pending, an 8.2 percent increase over last August.\n\u201cThat indicates that sustained buyer interest is out there, even as we head into the traditionally slower fall months,\u201d said Unlock MLS and Austin Board of Realtors president Brady Wuensch.\nBuyers are\ncanceling purchases\nat record rates, especially in Texas. As a result, it\u2019s worth wondering how many of the pending sales in Austin will finalize.\n\nOn the other hand, the effects of the Fed\u2019s Wednesday\ninterest rate cut\nare just as worthy of speculation.\n\u201cI think buyers and sellers have both recalibrated their expectations before waiting for the dramatic rate drops that we\u2019ve seen in the last couple years,\u201d Wuensch said.\nAs one developer put it, the Austin area is \u201c\nright-sizing\n\u201d after a few years of seller dominance. In 2020 and 2021, the city had one of the fastest-appreciating home markets in the country.\nAustin proper shows stronger vitals than some surrounding areas. Travis County, Williamson County, Hays County and the MSA overall registered a year-over-year decline in the number of residential homes sold, but Austin saw a 2 percent bump over last August with 900 homes sold.\nDespite signs of buyer interest, the city of Austin itself isn\u2019t out of a buyer\u2019s market yet, Wuensch said.\n\u201cFor buyers and sellers, we\u2019re seeing everybody be a bit more strategic,\u201d Wuensch said. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously not in the hot seller\u2019s market.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Ian Schrager is trading in his ivy-covered neoclassical home.\nThe Studio 54 co-founder and boutique hotel pioneer put his Bedford Corners estate in Westchester County on the market for $7.5 million, Curbed\nreported\n. Schrager bought the five-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bath spread in 2014 for $4.9 million, surprising those who associated him more with raw concrete condos.\nBuilt in 1936, the 12-acre property comes with manicured lawns, stone walls, a storybook pool house and interiors refreshed with white walls and dark floors. The listing leans on Schrager\u2019s pedigree as much as the house\u2019s charms, noting a renovation the family undertook the year they moved in.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Sally Slater has the\nlisting\n, which works out to $1,990 per square foot.\nThe move continues a recent sell-off for Schrager, who turns 80 next year. He listed a $7.5 million Miami Beach condo in a hotel he co-developed with Marriott last year and ultimately\nsold it for $7 million\n. He is still shopping a Dumbo loft he bought for $4.26 million in 2017, asking $3.95 million after a price cut.\n\nThe hotelier stepped away from Marriott in 2023, offloading select personal holdings as he narrows his focus.\nFor now, that focus is the Public, Schrager\u2019s bid to deliver a unique vision of luxury. He\u2019s said he has no plans to retire and is spending his days on the hotel brand\u2019s expansion.\nThis summer, an entity tied to the hotel\nfiled a summons\nagainst Whole Foods, seeking to prevent its delivery trucks from parking \u201cin front or in the vicinity\u201d of the property at 215 Chrystie Street. Whole Foods previously\nsued the hotel\n, alleging the crowd for the trendy bar prevents overnight deliveries at its East Houston Street location by restricting access to its driveway and loading docks.\nSchrager and Steve Witkoff opened the 28-story building \u2014 including 11 luxury condos on top of the hotel \u2014 in 2017, but were forced to close it down after the onset of the pandemic. The hotel reopened in the summer of 2021, but by the following year, the developers had defaulted on their $189 million senior mortgage and faced a UCC foreclosure on their equity in the property.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "More than 400 agents, brokers and clients gathered at Miami Beach real estate agent Darin Tansey\u2019s celebration of life on Wednesday morning, including Tansey\u2019s closest friends and industry colleagues.\nTansey, a top agent at Douglas Elliman with a huge reach,\ndied unexpectedly\nlast week of a heart attack at the age of 50. He mentored dozens of agents over his nearly 20-year career in Miami real estate, and worked on new developments that included the\nRitz-Carlton Residences, Miami Beach\n, where he lived.\nTansey is survived by his brother Jerry Tansey and his family, as well as extended family who include his cousin Bryan Tansey. His cousin said he was heartened to see the \u201cturnout and the love\u201d at the celebration of life.\n\u201cWe did everything together, but I\u2019m learning now there\u2019s so much he did that I had no idea about,\u201d he said.\nTansey died of a heart attack, his cousin said. His funeral and burial will be in his hometown of Burlington, Iowa.\nJay Parker, CEO of\nDouglas Elliman\nFlorida; Michael Liebowitz, CEO of Douglas Elliman; Elliman agent Chris Wands; Tansey\u2019s associate, Lynna Weil; and others gave speeches about Tansey to a packed room at La Gorce Country Club in\nMiami Beach\n.\n\u201cThe fact there are so many people here to celebrate his life does not surprise me one bit at all. Darin brought people together and left an impression and an imprint on everyone and everywhere he went,\u201d Wands said. \u201cWhen I think about Darin, the first thing that comes to mind isn\u2019t just his success, his reputation or his color-coded suits in his closet, or the career he built. It\u2019s the way he changed lives, mine included.\u201d\n\nAmong those who attended were Compass agent Nancy Batchelor; Julian Johnston and Eloy Carmenate from the Corcoran Group; The Agency\u2019s Sharon Beck; and Elliman agents Michael and Jaimee Light, Marc Brandt, David Siddons and Dina Goldentayer.\nWeil, Tansey\u2019s executive assistant, joked that Tansey loved three things: \u201cwork, wine and beautiful women.\u201d\n\u201cDarin had this incredible ability to find your strength immediately. He didn\u2019t focus on what we lacked, he focused on what we have,\u201d she said. \u201cHe carried himself with poise, sophistication and honor, and he cheered for everyone\u2019s success as though his very own and in an industry where that is so rare.\u201d\nMany spoke about their close friendship with Tansey.\n\u201cDarin\u2019s legacy is us, his family, friends, colleagues, business associates and our dear Vino [Tansey\u2019s dog],\u201d Parker said. \u201cLet\u2019s show Darin that his impact was powerful enough to cause us all to give a little more, love a little more and do the right thing, even when the alternative path is easier. You will be missed more than I could ever have imagined.\u201d\nLiebowitz, who took over as president and CEO of the brokerage last year, said Tansey \u201ctruly lived every day in a way that he really enjoyed himself.\u201d\n\u201cIt was the way he ate, the way he worked out, the way he did business, and the way he treated people. I never really ran into a person that had a negative thing to say about Darin, and that\u2019s unusual,\u201d Liebowitz said. \u201cUsually when you\u2019re at a memorial service, there\u2019s something you want to joke around about that you could say that\u2019s negative. I can\u2019t come up with one.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The cost of a U.S. Department Veterans Affairs project in Palo Alto has ballooned out of control.\nThe redevelopment of the Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Medical Center, originally slated as a $450.3 million endeavor, could now cost the federal government $1.6 billion, the Silicon Valley Business Journal\nreported\n. The department has been trying to renovate the complex for two decades.\nThe plan first called for demolishing six buildings at 3801 Miranda Avenue to make way for two buildings spanning more than 379,000 square feet as well as a parking garage. As time went on, the VA expanded the planned use of the development to include intensive rehabilitation care and an ambulatory care center. Those units meant more buildings added to the site, and as a result, more expenses.\nOriginally slated for completion in 2015, the languishing project is now expected to finish in 2036. It\u2019s about $1.2 billion over budget, with an estimated $74 million added to the costs every year that the project goes unfinished.\n\u201cBecause the Palo Alto project was never effectively governed, the costs and scope of the project grew out of control,\u201d Larry Reinkemeyer, the VA\u2019s assistant inspector general for audits and evaluations, wrote in a report cited by the outlet.\n\nThe office claimed that budgets and schedules were not fully analyzed and work requirements were tweaked without proper approval.\nTalks of redevelopment started in 2007 when a regional branch of the Veterans Integrated Service Network requested that Palo Alto receive a new ambulatory care center. Some buildings at the Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Medical Center were in need of renovation, but the addition of the 325,000-square-foot ambulatory care center project required the VA to do major construction at the site.\nCongress approved the VA\u2019s initial request for $450 million for the construction project in 2009. The VA approved a request for an additional $266 million in 2011, though most of that tranche hasn\u2019t been appropriated. Last year, the VA made its biggest request for a $907.8 million budget increase.\nAs of 2019, the VA had completed 10 phases of the project, including an intensive care unit and mental health center. The ambulatory care center has yet to be built. By February of this year, nine of the 12 buildings that were slated for demolition were still standing.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The property is currently a surface parking lot and was slated for the construction of a 60-story building featuring 713 residential units and parking as well as ground-floor retail.\nThe pullback comes one month after Mack\u2019s development arm, Mack Real Estate Development,\nreceived approvals\nfor the construction of a\n51-story residential high-rise\nat 1115 South Olive Street across the street.\nMack\u2019s proposed 60-story tower would have been the largest of a group of developments from the firm in the nearby area. Those include the 362-unit Wren apartments at 1230 Olive Street and the 536-unit Aven residential high-rise at 1120 South Grand Avenue.\nThe scuttled South Olive Street tower would\u2019ve risen 603 feet and featured 536 studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments above 4,178 square feet of ground-floor retail,\nper\nUrbanize. A four-level podium and six subterranean parking levels would\u2019ve had space for 581 cars. Rooftop and podium-level amenity decks were also part of the plan.\n\nIn addition to project entitlements, the Los Angeles City Council also approved a nearly $11.5 million public benefits package for the project in exchange for a floor area rights transfer from the Los Angeles Convention Center. Officials called for the funds to be allocated for affordable housing.\nAs it stands, Mack still has entitlements for the previously proposed 51-story Olive Street tower as well as another 16-story hotel tower nearby at 12th and Olive Streets. Neither of those projects, however, have made any progress toward construction.\nIt\u2019s the latest in a string of proposed high-rises around 11th Street in downtown that have failed to materialize in recent years.\nLast year, a proposed 40-story tower at 1111 South Hill Street from Australian developer Crown Group fell through after the Planning Department terminated entitlement proceedings after a lack of activity on the application since 2021. Similarly, a mid-rose hotel development from AEG at 1051-1059 South Grand Avenue and a proposed 70-story residential tower at 1045 South Olive Street from Crescent Heights have not moved forward.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Speculation arose about the next chapter for Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Hotel Chicago after its purchase earlier this summer by a firm known for timeshare conversions. Now we know the downtown property will be converted into a Sports Illustrated\u2013branded resort under a plan from Travel + Leisure, which is betting that timeshares can work in the Loop.\nThe Orlando-based vacation ownership giant said this week it will launch a 250-unit Sports Illustrated Resorts location in Chicago late next year, joining forthcoming sites in Nashville and Tuscaloosa, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The company didn\u2019t name the property, but people familiar with the deal told the outlet it will take over the 26-story Virgin Hotel at 203 North Wabash Avenue.\nThe world\u2019s first Virgin Hotel\nsold\nin June for $77.4 million to Michigan-based Accelerated Assets, a firm that specializes in converting hotels and apartments into timeshares. That\u2019s $309,600 per key. The seller was a joint venture between Miami\u2019s Lionstone Development and Virgin Hotels, which spent over $117 million \u2014 or $468,000 per key \u2014 to redevelop the landmark Old Dearborn Bank Building a decade ago. In 2020, Branson\u2019s Virgin Hotels Group and Lionstone Development\nlanded\na $37 million refinance on the hotel through Prime Finance, retiring an HSBC loan.\nTravel + Leisure said the project will involve converting an existing hotel and offering \u201cflexible, points-based ownership options,\u201d with sales to begin early next year. Construction is expected to wrap in late 2026, though the\nhotel\nwill remain open during the renovations.\nThe\nproperty\nrepresents a rare foray into urban timeshares. Those models are typically concentrated in resort destinations, though a handful operate in markets like New York City. The Chicago version will feature a redesigned lobby with sports-inspired d\u00e9cor, a street-level coffee shop, a restaurant and a sports bar, according to Travel + Leisure.\n\nThe plan ties together several players in the evolving hospitality niche. Sports Illustrated Resorts, launched in 2023 through a partnership with Sports Hospitality Ventures, licenses its brand from Authentic Brands Group, which owns the magazine\u2019s intellectual property. Accelerated Assets has a history in Chicago, teaming with Bluegreen Vacations to convert the Hotel Blake at 500 South Dearborn Street into timeshares in 2013.\nThe Virgin deal was on the higher end of where Chicago hotels trade. Accelerated\u2019s buy was among the priciest per-room sales since before the pandemic, possibly signaling the property would not continue as a traditional hotel. The 1928 building sits steps from Michigan Avenue and the Riverwalk. It was designed by Rapp &amp; Rapp in 1928 and landmarked in 2003.\nThe building\u2019s tax status offers another wrinkle: it\u2019s under a Class L landmark incentive, meaning it received discounted assessments for refurbishing a city landmark and will graduate back up to the standard 25 percent of value through 2027.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The Huizenga family and Integra Investments scored initial approval for changes to their long-planned $2 billion mixed-use development at the site of the Safe Harbor Rybovich, better known as Rybovich Marina.\nThe partners are planning a massive redevelopment of the 19-acre waterfront site, spanning from 4000 to 4300 North Flagler Drive, adjacent to the superyacht marina. The West Palm Beach Planning Board rubber stamped the developers\u2019 requested changes to the design guidelines and site plans at its meeting Tuesday. The updated plans still need approval by the West Palm Beach City Commission.\nThe new site plan calls for 20,691 square feet of office space, 37,445 square feet of retail, 14,376 square feet of restaurants, 12,750 square feet of crew amenities and 3,355 square feet of marine storage.\nThe plan limits the total number of residential units allowed to 1,059. Of that allotment, Related Group\u2019s\nIcon Marina Village\nalready accounts for 399 apartments. For the remaining allowed 660 units, Huizenga and Integra are planning four waterfront condominium towers, the highest of which will be 445 feet tall. So far, the developers are only seeking approval on plans for two of the towers, totaling 259 units. One is slated to span 34 stories with 147 units, and the other 36 stories with 112 units, a spokesperson for the developers confirmed.\nThe updated site plan also adds 60,937 square feet for a private or semi-private club, which will be aimed at residents of the planned condominiums and will allow for 250 non-resident memberships, planning documents show.\nThe addition of the private club comes as\ndemand for members\u2019 clubs has surged\nin Palm Beach County, with limited availability creating yearslong waits.\n\nThe Rybovich Marina redevelopment has been in the works for more than a decade, and was first approved in 2014. The city created the Marina Commercial Marine Planned Development (CMPD), allowing for 1,059 residential units, 35,000 square feet of offices, 10,000 square feet of retail, 15,000 square feet of restaurants, 45,000 square feet of marine industrial space and 10,000 square feet of crew amenities, planning documents show.\nThe site is rare for both its size and its water frontage, in a city where developers are racing to snap up the last buildable properties along the Intracoastal Waterway.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to find a 19-acre private property with waterfront that you see here today,\u201d said Brian Seymour, an attorney for the developers.\nHuizenga Holdings is led by H. Wayne Huizenga, Jr., the son of late billionaire H. Wayne Huizenga who is best known for building up companies like Waste Management, Blockbuster Video, Extended Stay America and AutoNation. The Huizengas are the longtime owners of the Rybovich Marina site, and also have an ownership stake in Safe Harbor.\nH. Wayne Huizenga, Jr. and his wife own the nearby waterfront house at 3100 North Flagler Drive, which they bought for $5 million in 2018. Property records show the county estimates its market value at $26.6 million.\nIntegra is led by Paulo Tavares de Melo, Nelson Stabile and Victor Ballestas. The Huizengas and Integra tapped architecture firm Kohn Pedersen Fox, known for its role in Related Companies\u2019\nHudson Yards\nmegaproject in New York City, to design the marina district.\nThe planned Rybovich Marina condos are among the\nmore than 2,000 units planned for West Palm Beach\n. Since the 2014 approval, the pandemic triggered a dramatic wealth migration to Palm Beach County, transforming the region and its real estate market.",

Scott Wiener in 2018, allows the construction of up to nine stories for buildings adjacent to certain bus stops and train stations, seven stories for buildings within a quarter-mile of the stops, and six stories for buildings within a half-mile. It would also subject single-family neighborhoods within a half-mile of transit stops to the zoning regulations.\nWhile working its way through the legislature, the bill was amended to only apply to counties with more than 15 high-frequency train or bus stops. That left just seven counties in the state to deal with it: Alameda, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara. Once Orange County\u2019s streetcar project is completed next year, it will also be subject to the bill\u2019s application.\nBy changing the bill\u2019s language defining which stations count toward that 15-station threshold, Contra Costa County escaped any\nSB 79-related upzoning\n. The county has 12 Bay Area Rapid Transit stations and three Amtrak stations, in Richmond, Martinez and Antioch.\n\nThe Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors and city councilmembers in Lafayette and Orinda\npleaded with state lawmakers\nto push the amendment through. Their argument was that SB 79 would increase density along fire evacuation zones and put residents at risk.\nThe final version of the bill upheld Wiener\u2019s vision, while also \u201crespecting the distinct needs of each community,\u201d said state Assemblymember Anamarie Avila Farias, who represents northern Contra Costa County.\nOther amendments to the bill include stopping developers from using SB 79 to advance a project that would demolish more than two rent-controlled apartments, which prevents most multifamily buildings built before 2014 from being redeveloped through the law, allowing cities to exempt certain areas defined as \u201clow-resource\u201d by the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee if they also plan for density in other parts of the city, and giving cities permission draft alternative zoning plans within transit areas next year, though they must preserve at least half the density the proposed law calls for.\nSB 79 heads to Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s desk next month.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Real Estate Board of New York President Jim Whelan\u2019s advice for potential Mayor Zohran Mamdani is simple: Surround yourself with good people.\n\u201cHire the best people you can,\u201d he said during an event hosted by Crain\u2019s on Thursday. \u201cIt is a really, really difficult job.\u201d\nThe \u201cbest people,\u201d he said, should be hired regardless of ideology. In other words, a Mamdani administration that won\u2019t be stacked solely with members of the Democratic Socialists of America.\nWhelan said whoever becomes mayor, \u201cit\u2019s in all our interests that he succeeds.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking to work closely with Mayor Mamdani if he is the winner on November 4,\u201d he said.\nMamdani\u2019s opponents have repeatedly criticized his lack of previous experience (he has been a state Assembly member, representing the 36th District in Queens, since 2021). Critics and supporters alike will be watching who joins his administration closely.\nMamdani has been tight-lipped about potential administration hires. In fact, reported overtures by Comptroller Brad Lander to become the first deputy mayor have allegedly caused tension between the two,\nGothamist reported\n.\n\nThe remarks come after months of some in the industry flip-flopping on their support of candidates vying to beat Mamdani\nReal estate executives poured millions of dollars into backing former Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s campaign ahead of the June primary. Some shifted their allegiance to Mayor Eric Adams after his loss, but support fizzled alongside the mayor\u2019s poor polling numbers.\nOthers, however, including some affordable housing developers, have been\nvocal\nabout trying to work with Mamdani as the presumed next mayor.\nStill, a number of industry players have\ndonated\ntens of thousands of dollars to various anti-Mamdani political action committees. Related Companies CEO Jeff Blau reportedly organized a meeting of business leaders this month to\nstrategize\nCuomo\u2019s potential path to victory.\nWhelan and REBNY chair Jed Walentas met with Mamdani last month,\nas The Real Deal previously reported\n. Whelan described Mamdani as a \u201cgood listener\u201d and said they discussed topics where they agree (the need for upzonings, increasing housing vouchers, fully staffing the city\u2019s housing agencies), points where they might agree (how to ramp up housing production) and areas where they disagree (Mamdani\u2019s proposal to freeze rents for stabilized apartments).\nDuring Thursday\u2019s event, Whelan also highlighted some of the trade group\u2019s legislative priorities next year. For example, he believes \u201cthe idea of increasing taxes is going to be a robust conversation in Albany next year,\u201d an effort that REBNY will oppose. He also expressed hope that lawmakers will eventually change the city\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions law, Local Law 97, to help property owners comply. He additionally floated extending the office-to-residential conversions tax exemption, 467m, and increasing the value of the incentive for projects outside of Manhattan.\n",

        "content": "The Caltagirone brothers\u2019 Calta Group scored approval for a 499-unit Live Local Act tower in Allapattah, marking one of the first Miami projects under the state law with both condos and apartments.\nCoral Gables-based Calta plans the 30-story Anatomia with 6,500 square feet of retail at 1415\u20131469 Northwest 13th Terrace in Miami, according to the developer\u2019s news release. At its Wednesday meeting, the City of Miami Urban Development Review Board approved the project.\nDesigned by Corwil Architects, Anatomia will consist of 289 luxury condos and 210 apartments, the release says.\nThe Live Local Act, which Florida lawmakers approved in 2023 and tweaked in the following two years, awards developers with density and height bonuses in exchange for including apartments at below-market rate rents in their projects. Under the law, at least 40 percent of units have to be designated for households earning no more than 120 percent of the area median income.\nWhile the law allows for projects to include condos, the workforce and affordable units have to be apartments.\nAt Anatomia, all residents will share a lobby and access to the primary amenity deck, the release says.\nThe tower also will have a rooftop lounge for condo owners and members.\n\nOf the 210 apartments, 128 will be studios and 82 will be one-bedroom units. The condos will range from studios averaging 419 square feet to three-bedroom units averaging 1,111 square feet, with asking prices from $500,000 to $950,000, according to the release.\nCalta bought the 1.1-acre, two-lot development site in two deals, paying $10 million in 2023 for one of the parcels, and $7.2 million last year for the other, records show.\nCalta, which Gaetano Caltagirone leads with Ignazio Caltagirone, has been ramping up its South Florida development activity in recent years. The brothers, who founded the firm in 2010, grew up in a real estate family in Italy, and started betting on South Florida\u2019s housing market during the Great Recession, renovating and flipping houses.\nIn Hollywood, Calta developed the eight-story, 180-unit\nRevv Hollywood\napartment building at 2233 Hollywood Boulevard.\nIn Coral Gables, it plans the Via Veneto project with 10 three-story townhomes at 915 and 920 Palermo Avenue in Coral Gables. Calta launched sales last year, with asking prices at the time starting at\n$5.5 million\n.\nIn February, Calta scored a\n$53.7 million\nconstruction loan for the 151-unit Caltopia Hollywood apartment project at 2750 Van Buren Street, as well as the 100-unit Caltopia Hollywood II apartment project at 2217-2239 Jackson Street in Hollywood.\nSouth Florida developers have seized on the\nLive Local Act\nwith proposals for large projects. The biggest known Live Local complex on tap in Miami-Dade County is Spanish developer Pablo Castro and his local partner Laura Tauber\u2019s\n4,032-unit\nHueHub in West Little River. The project will have seven 35-story apartment towers at 8395 Northwest 27th Avenue.\nElsewhere, RCC Developers proposes a\n25-story, 300-unit\nLive Local tower on the northeast corner of Southwest 214th Street and U.S. 1/South Dixie Highway in Goulds. Masoud and Stephanie Shojaee\u2019s Shoma Group wants to build the 16-story, 201-unit\nPonce 8\nLive Local apartment building at 3808-3850 Southwest Eighth Street in Coral Gables.",

National Real Estate plans to construct a 41-story, 710-foot-tall tower above The Bloc\u2019s existing 12-level parking structure.\nThe development would add 466 studio, one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments to the property.

Approximately $8.4 million of that will go toward amenities in the downtown area, including an affordable housing acquisition in Little Tokyo. Another $3 million will go toward street lighting repair in downtown and the general public benefit trust fund for Council District 14.\nEarlier this year, The Bloc lost its\nanchor tenant Macy\u2019s\n, though that space has been partially filled by a sports-oriented social club.

It could signal that a foreclosure process might be imminent, though Highbridge could still pursue a refinancing deal or loan modification, or sell the properties outright to offload the loan.\nHighbridge bought the three office properties between 2016 and 2019 for a total of $119.6 million, according to the Business Times. \u201cDeadliest Catch\u201d producer Thom Beers and music producer Dr. Luke are among the firm\u2019s backers.\nRialto provided a $111 million loan in 2022 to refinance $91.1 million in existing debt and fund future renovations and improvements for the three properties. The following year, Highbridge hammered out a forbearance deal with Rialto Capital Management after falling more than 30 days delinquent on its loan. At the time, Highbridge founder\ntold\nThe Real Deal\nthat the firm was no longer considered delinquent after that deal.\n\nAfter that, Highbridge reportedly made several late payments and delinquencies, according to the Business Times. The loan transferred to special servicing from August to October of 2024. As of this July, the\nRialto\nloan had an outstanding balance of $94.5 million.\nThe loan itself is still active, so its lender can still pursue foreclosure, refinancing or term modifications, per the Business Times.\nOakland\u2019s office market has struggled to regain occupancy in the years after the pandemic. In the city\u2019s central business district,\nvacancy\nsits at around 27 percent, while leasing activity dropped 30 percent last quarter, according to the Business Times. As of the end of last year, Highbridge\u2019s Oakland office portfolio had a combined occupancy of 34 percent; that includes 60 percent occupancy at the Tribune Tower, 25 percent at 1500 Broadway and 16 percent at 405 15th Street.\nThe slump has led to the sale of several office properties at steep discounts, including 180 Grand Avenue, 1950 Franklin Street, 1700 Broadway and 1440 Broadway. It remains to be seen if Highbridge opts to go the route of the 1515 Webster Street building, which it sold last year for $22.5 million after buying it in 2019 for nearly $19.3 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The home of America\u2019s biggest university restricted shared housing for decades, but with a new state law in effect, dense inventory in College Station is poised to grow.\nTexas A&amp;M University has the biggest student body in the country, aside from universities with online schools, with over 70,000 students on campus each fall. Before this month, it was illegal for five or more unrelated people to share a home or apartment in most of College Station. Only certain neighborhoods were allowed exceptions to the \u201cno more than four\u201d rule, a rare restriction that became especially tight in a city of young, single tenants living away from their families.\n\u201cOnly a handful of other cities in the state were using restrictive occupancy at a relationship level,\u201d property manager and developer Jeffrey Leatherwood said.\nStudents, real estate agents and developers, including Leatherwood, helped convince the Texas legislature to pass Senate Bill 1567, which was fine-tuned for College Station. The law forbids college towns with populations of less than 250,000 from enforcing resident limits based on age, occupation, familial status or relationship status.\n\u201cThe City of College Station was putting real estate people in a difficult situation, and SB 1567 made it a lot easier for us to conduct business,\u201d Leatherwood said.\nThe bill took effect Sept. 1, and it\u2019s not clear how long it will take the market to adjust. No permits for dense \u201cAg shack\u201d developments have been approved in formerly restricted neighborhoods yet.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to be interesting to see is when that six-bedroom plan gets submitted to the city, in an area where they had been traditionally pushing back on those plans, if that\u2019s going to go through,\u201d developer Scott Hancock said.\nMeanwhile, recent student housing deals include a $30 million loan for Culver Investment Partners to acquire a condo property on Harvey Mitchell Parkway in a zone that did not have a shared housing exception, according to Traded.\n\nThe city is working to \u201cclean up the books\u201d and align with the law, said City Councilmember Bob Yancy, who criticized the law before it took effect.\nDevelopers expect College Station to forestall dense development by other means, just as other Texas cities have attempted to hinder\nYIMBY legislation\n. For example, in response to\nanother state law\nthat allows residential development in commercial areas without rezoning,\nArlington\nenacted requirements for parking space, balcony length and mandatory amenities, like swimming pools. Plano, Frisco and Irving have created\nsimilar requirements\n.\nThe city enforced the \u201cno more than four\u201d rule by citing homes with more than four cars parked out front. The city could try parking restrictions as a de facto cap on residents per unit, Hancock said.\nThe council will likely institute new parking rules, but they will aim to improve road safety rather than counter SB 1567, Yancy said.\n\u201cOur own housing policies were unnecessarily restrictive in housing starts,\u201d Yancy said, referring to ordinances besides the \u201cno more than four\u201d rule.\nThe city has a shortage of about 4,900 units, he said.\n\u201cApproximately 10 years ago, the city began enforcing more stringent building regulations and fees, and they had a significant impact on our housing market and, I believe, exacerbated the occupancy problems that we have had throughout the city,\u201d he said.\n",

        "content": "Terrell isn\u2019t ready to greenlight one of the largest master-planned communities pitched in North Texas.\nCity council members postponed a vote on Terra Nova, a proposed 1,550-acre community from Plano-based Main Square Development this week, after a tense meeting where residents aired concerns about scale, infrastructure and whether the developer can deliver on promises. The council will revisit the plan in November, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe project\ncalls\nfor 3,600 single-family homes, 1,200 multifamily units, 145 acres of parks and a 50-acre downtown-style district dubbed Terra Nova Village, all located mostly empty land bordered by Griffith Avenue, Poetry Road and County Road 245. Hugo Morales, Main Square\u2019s president, has pitched it as a community\ndesigned\nto elevate Terrell\u2019s appeal while integrating into the city\u2019s existing fabric.\nFor Morales, who founded Main Square last year after two decades with Kimley Horn, the project is a bet on both his startup firm and Terrell.\nBut skeptics aren\u2019t sold. Most respondents to a city survey were not in favor of the development. City Staff received two petitions with about 80 signatures not in favor.\nA resident who spoke at the meeting, Pamela Robertson, urged phased approvals rather than a blanket sign-off.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a first-time development for this developer,\u201d she said, warning against rubber-stamping a plan that could take up to two decades to build out. Her fear is that Terrell could end up replicating the rapid, infrastructure-straining growth of cities like Forney, Prosper and Princeton.\nThose examples loom large. Princeton, the fastest-growing city in the U.S. this year, recently slammed the brakes on residential permits through a temporary moratorium to buy time for roads and utilities to catch up.\nTerrell officials appeared mindful of that precedent. Chris Snapp, the city\u2019s development director, told council members that traffic impact studies will be updated at each stage of Terra Nova\u2019s 14-to-16-phase rollout to hold the developer accountable.\nMorales said the\nscale\nof Terra Nova would be a strength rather than a risk to Terrell\u2019s growth.\n\u201cIt\u2019s much easier to create a good community when you have a larger area of land,\u201d he told the chamber, rather than piecemeal developments.\nThe project embodies some tension playing out across fast-growing Dallas suburbs as\nwell\nas in the urban core, between the need for housing and the capacity of local governments to manage rapid expansion.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "City Council members considering passing the\nCommunity Opportunity to Purchase Act\nmight want to see how Chicago\u2019s version is working.\nThe answer, it seems, is not well. Two City Council members pulled their wards out of the law\u2019s coverage area. One told Crain\u2019s Chicago Business that the law is burdening apartment building sales with\nred tape\nfor the sake of tenants who are completely unprepared to buy their buildings.\nAlderman Felix Cardona Jr. commended the idea of the law, but said it doesn\u2019t even teach tenants how to get a mortgage, let alone manage a co-op or condo.\n\u201cThe success of this initiative heavily depends on the preparedness of prospective buyers, particularly tenants who may not have experience navigating the homebuying process,\u201d he said at a council meeting, according to Crain\u2019s.\nThe Real Deal\nexplained in a\nmagazine story\n: \u201cThe backlash against the program follows landlord complaints that it kills deals to sell or refinance their buildings, and get title insurance, by delaying closings and injecting uncertainty into the process.\u201d\nStudies of such laws, often called the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, or TOPA, have found that they only work for tenants if the government also provides funding, in part to prepare tenants to become homeowners and collectively run an apartment building.\nThe HDFC co-op program might be New York\u2019s most successful effort of this sort, but it does not affect private building sales like TOPA and COPA would. And the opportunities to create HDFCs are now exceedingly rare.\nMost of the approximately 1,300 HDFCs were created decades ago from buildings acquired by the city through tax foreclosures, which don\u2019t happen anymore. (Lenders usually foreclose first, and the city now sells tax and water/sewer liens rather than become a landlord.) Tenants did not have to come up with down payments and mortgages because the city typically sold the building for what they were paying in rent.\nHDFCs, to be sure, have had their share of problems (33 in Manhattan made the \u201c\nworst landlords\n\u201d list in 2016), but guardrails have been put in place over the years to prevent mismanagement or exploitation of the buildings by shareholders. Hundreds of HDFCs have regulatory agreements with HPD, which contracts with nonprofits such as UHAB to provide oversight and technical assistance.\n\u201cFor the most part, HDFCs run well and people who live in HDFCs are honest,\u201d said UHAB\u2019s Oscar McDonald. \u201cIn a few buildings where there are bad actors, that is not an indictment of all HDFCs.\u201d\nHDFCs were fairly successful because the buildings were basically free. TOPA bills imagine tenants quickly organizing to buy valuable buildings, which they are typically not ready, willing or able to do.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nI decided to look up the property records of 535 First Street, a 6,500-square-foot, renovated Park Slope limestone that just sold for\n$13.9 million\n, a\nneighborhood record for single-family homes\n.\nIt was the home of a childhood friend of mine, Nicky Gussoff. His parents, Bernard and Judith Gussoff, bought it in 1966 from Mary D. Tully. (The neighborhood had a lot of Irish in those days; my parents bought the Loughlin family\u2019s house two blocks away in 1967.)\nThe exact price the Gussoffs paid is not in city records, but their mortgage is. Tully, the seller, provided it to the buyers: $9,500. She gave the Gussoffs 15 years to pay it back, which they did in 1981. Their monthly payment began at $46.\n\nWhat has become of your childhood home? Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The Related Companies\ndenied\na\nDaily News report\nthat it was contemplating offering Mayor Eric Adams a job to stop him from campaigning for re-election. The firm said it has no intention of doing so. That makes sense, because a prosecutor might see it as bribery.\nOffering something of value to a public official to do something that would benefit the offerer is illegal. In this case, the benefit to a real estate firm would be a better chance for Andrew Cuomo to defeat Zohran Mamdani in the November election.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 An upcoming City Council vote will put member deference to the test. The Council will soon vote on whether to build a development for formerly incarcerated people on a Bronx hospital campus. But,\nGothamist\nreports, despite earlier support, Mayor Eric Adams has pulled away from the proposal amid opposition from local Council member Kristy Marmorato. Several other Council members, however, say they will still vote yes, meaning the project may still be greenlit.\n\u2014 Democratic officials were arrested in lower Manhattan on Thursday night after trying to gain access to an area containing ICE detainees, the New York Times\nreports\n. The 11 Democrats, including Comptroller Brad Lander, were trying to inspect the 10th floor of 26 Federal Plaza, which has been subject to allegations of unsanitary conditions. When ICE denied the group entry, the officials reportedly sat on the floor, started chanting and unfurled a banner that said \u201cNYers against ICE.\u201d\n\u2014 New York State Democratic Party Chairman Jay Jacobs said he will not endorse Zohran Mamdani, citing disagreements over Israel and democratic socialism, per the\nNew York Times\n. Gov. Kathy Hochul publicly backed Mamdani earlier this week.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$13.9 million\nfor a 6,500-square-foot at 535 First Street in Park Slope. Tim Malone of Compass had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$13.5 million\nfor a 6,865-square-foot apartment building at 280 West 11th Street in the West Village.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$40 million\nfor a 12,400-square-foot house at 2 East 82nd Street on the Upper East Side. The property last traded for\n$19 million\nin 2023. Adam Modlin has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 87,279-square-foot, 14-story, mixed-use project at 19 Clay Street in Greenpoint. Murat Mutlu of INOA Architecture filed the permit on behalf of Idan Shitrit of Investmates.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

Cannell has sold for $20 million.\nThe Cannell family trust placed the home, at 2125 Ocean Way, on the market in July, nabbing precisely what it asked for at the time of the listing, which pencils out to $4,246 per square foot.\nA trust tied to Capital Group portfolio manager Barry Crosthwaite and Jennifer Crosthwaite are the buyers, according to the deed.\nBerkshire Hathaway HomeServices California Properties\u2019 Shauna Covington and Leita Covington were the listing agents, while Pacific Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Spencer Wall represented the buyer.\nThe deal is Laguna\u2019s second priciest, on-market trade this year, according to listing sites. Still, it doesn\u2019t topple the most expensive sale to date, which was the $22 million trade of\n32221 South Coast Highway\nin July. That gated, 3.7-acre property includes several parcels, three structures and private beach access.\nThe Ocean Way property was one of two residences, the other being in Pasadena, where Cannell spent his time until his death in 2010.\n\nProperty records show Cannell purchased the\nLaguna Beach\nhome in 1999 for $1,093 per square foot, or $5.2 million.\nThe property sits atop a bluff with unobstructed views of the ocean. The home has four bedrooms and four-and-a-half bathrooms across 4,700 square feet. It\u2019s gated and set on a 10,000-square-foot lot.\nRecent upgrades include hardwood flooring, lighting and HVAC system.\nOne of two offices in the home was used by Cannell, whose prolific career spanned television and novels. Cannell is behind dozens of TV shows, including \u201cThe Rockford Files,\u201d \u201cThe A-Team,\u201d \u201c21 Jump Street\u201d and \u201cThe Commish.\u201d \u201cThe Rockford Files\u201d earned him a Primetime Emmy Award in the Outstanding Drama Series category in 1978.\nHe became an independent producer with the start of Stephen J. Cannell Productions, which later became Cannell Entertainment.\nThere are also more than 15 novels Cannell authored, including a series involving a Los Angeles detective named Shane Scully.\n",

        "content": "The $252 million transformation of Vernon Hills\u2019 Hawthorn Mall is moving into its next act, after Village trustees approved a revised plan for Phase II of Hawthorn 2.0, clearing the way for construction to start next year.\nThe changes mark the third iteration of Phase II and reflect what Dallas-based Centennial Real Estate, one of the project\u2019s ownership partners, called a major improvement over the version\nsigned\noff in 2022, the Daily Herald\nreported\n. Tweaks include relocating and expanding the residential component to 288 apartments across two four-story buildings, up from 255 units.\nRetail will also get a bump to 37,300 square feet of ground-level space. The buildings will straddle a covered paseo, and the plan also includes a direct connection to the intersection of Route 21 and Townline Road.\nAlong with Centennial, the project partners include development and construction company Focus Development, real estate investment firm Affinius Capital and Atlanta-based developer Atlantic Residential.\nThe new scheme\nspares\nmuch more of the original 1970s-era mall. Earlier versions had called for\nremoving\nnearly a third of the remaining space, but the updated plan pares that demolition down to just 5,600 square feet \u2014 the former Barnes &amp; Noble box \u2014 while reworking the east and south facades into outward-facing retail lined by landscaped plazas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a substantially improved plan, layout and use of real estate,\u201d said Sam Whitebread, Centennial\u2019s vice president of development.\nThe apartments will build on The Domaine, the luxury rental complex delivered in Phase I that\u2019s now 95 percent leased. Fifty-eight of the units will be set aside for tenants earning 60 percent of area median income.\nThe village\u2019s sign-off required a special-use permit, subdivision plat and revised development agreement, but the approvals sailed through. The project team \u2014 Centennial, Focus, Atlantic Residential and Affinius Capital \u2014 expects to start construction next spring, with the first openings slated for late 2027.\nRather than\ngutting\nthe mall, the developers are betting on a mix of fresh housing, open-air retail and selective demolition to keep the property relevant.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

A preliminary zoning approval this week paved the way for two condo towers, a hotel and commercial space on the site, Chron\nreported\n.\nThe first phase calls for a 216-room Marriott Renaissance hotel, 150 condo units and 70,000 square feet of office, retail and restaurant space, according to project filings. Four acres would be dedicated to green space and a nature preserve. A second phase would add two apartment buildings with 236 units, including workforce housing and rentals for J-1 visa students tied to the University of Texas Medical Branch.\nEldawy told city officials the plan could generate 2,300 jobs across construction, hospitality and retail. He\u2019s also eyeing restaurant tenants, including a Floyds Cajun Seafood outpost and a franchise of La Madeleine that he plans to operate himself.\n\nThe project has already cleared one regulatory hurdle: FAA approval for towers up to 145 feet, or about 11 stories, given the site\u2019s proximity to Scholes International Airport. Even so, the airport has raised concerns about possible impacts on air traffic.\nThe design comes from Steven Biegel of Round Rock-based Place Designers, whose portfolio includes the nearby Diamond Beach and\nTiara on the Beach\ncondos, as well as\nprojects\nin Padre Island. Eldawy said the development is aimed at\nluring\nmore permanent and international residents to Galveston, alongside tourists.\nThe project now heads to Galveston City Council, and Eldawy hopes to start construction late next year and deliver the first phase by 2029. That timeline would make Sachs on the Seawall one of the island\u2019s most ambitious developments in decades, positioned across from the luxury Diamond Beach condos and next to the longtime Seahorse Grill. The 236-unit second phase could be completed by 2031, Biegel said.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

During the same time last year, it took New York flippers an average of 184 days to sell properties, earning a gross ROI of 42.6 percent.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

The\nSegerstrom family\n\u2019s development is expected to bring in revenue to the city through taxes and a $9.3 million community benefit payment to the city, Bacerra said.\n\u201cThis project provides housing while also providing much-needed commercial spaces. Santa Ana cannot thrive or survive by only providing the housing for other city workers and other cities\u2019 economic engines,\u201d Bacerra said. \u201cPrevious city leaders did not cultivate this level of economic development. Instead, they chose to force higher sales tax on our residents.\u201d\nUnder the plan, 1,583 residential units, as well as restaurants, retail, offices, bikeways and acres of publicly accessible open space would be constructed at the South Coast Plaza site at 3333 Bristol Street.\n\nThe South Coast Plaza shopping center brings in more than $500,000 annually in tax revenue for the city, according to a city staff\nreport\n. The proposed Village project is estimated to bring in nearly $5.5 million each year in tax revenue. It\u2019s also projected to create around 9,000 jobs, 1,000 of which will be recurring.\nAging and underutilized malls in\nBrea\n, Westminster, Buena Park and Laguna Hills have similarly seen proposals to convert into a mix of retail and homes. Under the state\u2019s housing mandate, cities across Orange County must plan for more than 180,000 new homes by the end of the decade.\nOf those, approximately 40 percent must be designated for lower-income families, according to Voice of OC. Developers of the South Coast Plaza project will skirt that requirement by paying $7.1 million in fees to go toward building\naffordable housing\nelsewhere in Santa Ana.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A plan to rezone Broadway in Edgewater and Uptown is finally moving forward at Chicago City Hall \u2014 and neighborhood groups are waging all-out campaigns for and against it.\nThe monthslong delayed proposal \u2014 backed by aldermen Angela Clay, Leni Manaa-Hoppenworth and Matt Martin \u2014 would upzone Broadway from Montrose to Devon avenues, allowing denser residential projects and a wider range of commercial uses. The ordinances, introduced in April, have been repeatedly postponed amid fierce community debate but are now slated for an Oct. 14 zoning hearing, Block Club\nreported\n.\nThe area is the\ntarget\nof ongoing infrastructure improvements, particularly the $2.1 billion Red Line modernization, which is expected to be completed\nthis\nyear.\nCommunity shopping district zoning, proposed for the area between Devon and Foster Avenues, would prohibit bars and liquor stores but permit retail and restaurants. The initiative would upzone much of the corridor to neighborhood commercial designations and would pave a way for residential and retail buildings up to seven stories.\nOpposition has been loud in Edgewater, where neighbors pooled funds to hire an attorney and erected two billboards directing passersby to a campaign website, SaveEdgewater.org. Members of the group Edgewater Residents for Responsible Development argue the city\u2019s outreach has been inadequate and say rezoning would eliminate their chance to weigh in on projects case by case. John Holden, president of the Edgewater Historical Society, has been a leading opposition figure.\nSupporters, meanwhile, have mounted a digital push to lobby aldermen. They argue that loosening restrictions will bring housing, affordability and vibrancy to a corridor long dominated by low-rise strip malls.\n\nUnder the plan, most of Broadway in Uptown would shift to zoning that allows buildings up to 80 feet \u2014 generally five to seven stories \u2014 and permits uses from salons to dispensaries. To counter fears of drive-thrus and gas stations, the city says it will layer in a \u201cpedestrian street\u201d designation banning curb cuts and requiring buildings to front the sidewalk, effectively barring strip center development.\nIn\nEdgewater\n, Broadway would be rezoned primarily to allow 80-foot mixed-use buildings with retail below and housing above. A section between Balmoral and Foster would be zoned with a 70-foot cap, after feedback from neighbors concerned about block-scale development.\nMuch of Edgewater\u2019s stretch of Broadway is capped at 50 feet, or about four stories. Opponents argue that raising the ceiling to seven stories or more will flood the market with expensive units while delivering little in the way of affordability. Some are already preparing for a potential legal battle.\nIn Uptown, where\nsimilar\nzoning is already in place, pushback has been muted. Hundreds of apartments have risen along Broadway in recent years, fitting into the neighborhood\u2019s larger wave of redevelopment.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Formerly known as Banyan Bay Apartments, the property has been renamed Legacy at Coconut Creek, Vizzda states.\nLegacy partially financed the purchase with a $64.4 million loan from Truist Bank. The deal breaks down to $185,096 per apartment.\nThe seller, an affiliate of Chicago-based\nNuveen Real Estate\n, sold the complex for more than triple the previous sale price nearly three decades ago.

        "content": "More houses are for sale in Houston than ever before.\nHouston neared 44,000 home listings in August, marking a year-over-year increase of more than 8,000 homes and driving its inventory to the biggest in the country, according to Homes.com.\nSingle-family detached homes accounted for the lion\u2019s share of inventory last month with over 39,000 listings, but townhouses and condos proliferated faster. About 700 more townhouses and 500 more condos were for sale last month compared to a year prior, representing bumps of 30 percent and 39 percent, respectively. Listings for detached homes increased at 22 percent.\nAlthough conditions are increasingly favoring buyers, the median home price was flat in August for the first time in months at $340,000. Houston registered lowering prices from March to July. Nationally, the median home price rose by more than 2 percent year-over-year last month to $389,000, putting Houston well within reach of a\nbuyer\u2019s market\n, said CoStar director of market analytics Itziar Aguirre.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s recent interest rate cut\nwill encourage more buyer interest, Aguirre said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing houses sit on the market longer. We\u2019re seeing prices go down, especially in the condo market. And, mortgage rates, while they\u2019re still high, they\u2019re actually at the lowest they\u2019ve been in about a year,\u201d Aguirre said.\nHouston\u2019s record-setting inventory follows years of breakneck building. The city issued\nover 230,000 building permits\nbetween 2020 and 2023, surpassing every other city in the country. It issued\nover 11,000 permits\nin January and February, which amounted to 6 percent of activity in the 150 biggest cities in the country, and almost 37 percent of permits issued in Texas.\n\u201cI would say there\u2019s probably a bit of market correction going on since Houston saw significant price appreciation from 2020 to 2022,\u201d Aguirre added.\n",

The San Francisco-based company, which makes artificial intelligence-enabled vehicle operations and automation management software, is the first to grab a piece of the 460,000-square-foot sublease offering.\nMotive, formerly KeepTruckin, is expected to move into the X space in phases, starting with a 25,000 square feet.

About 740,000 square feet is being marketed for sublease, with some of it lingering on the market for five years.\nX left San Francisco last year and established its headquarters in Austin; its Bay Area employees and operations moved to other offices in San Jose.\nOffice vacancy was 45.7 in Mid-Market in the second quarter, according to Kidder Mathews.

        "content": "News broke last month that Playboy was trading Beverly Hills for the Magic City, but now the once-iconic brand is looking to sweeten the deal.\nPlayboy Enterprises International, led by CEO Ben Kohn, wants $800,000 in incentives from the city of Miami Beach, and could pull out of its lease for the 20,000-square-foot penthouse floor at\nRobert Rivani\u2019s\nRivani office building at 1691 Washington Avenue if the city commission votes against the company\u2019s request, the\nSouth Florida Business Journal\nreported.\nThe outlet referenced the lease agreement with Rivani, which was recently filed along with Playboy\u2019s quarterly earnings report.\nThe incentive request is based on Miami Beach\u2019s Job Creation Incentive Program (JCIP), an initiative that awards new-to-market and growing companies per-employee incentives. New market entrants are eligible for up to $60,000 per year for four years, but the\nMiami Beach City Commission\ncan vote to waive the cap for applicants. Playboy, which has around 250 employees, has applied for $200,000 per year for four years, the outlet reported.\n\nIf the incentives are not awarded by Dec. 31, Playboy can terminate its lease. Rivani can also choose to grant the incentives in the form of a $200,000 per year rent abatement for four years. If he decides against it, Playboy can move forward with termination.\nRivani bought the seven-story mixed-use building formerly known as The Lincoln for\n$62.5 million\nlast year. He is currently in the process of a $40 million renovation of the building. The filing revealed additional details about his lease terms with Playboy, including that the brand is set to pay $2.1 million in first year\u2019s rent. The base rent will increase 3 percent annually, and the final year of the lease rent will be nearly $2.9 million. The lease can also be extended by five years two times.\nThe brand\u2019s relocation plans extend far beyond the 10-year lease it signed with Rivani. It is also planning a content studio, a private Playboy Club with a restaurant and communal spaces inspired by the Playboy Mansion. The company expects to create 75 full-time jobs with an average annual wage of $175,000, the outlet reported.\n\u2013\u2013\nKate Hinsche",

        "content": "The state\u2019s push for housing density, along with the need for new homes post-wildfires is driving demand for Airbnb spinoff\nSamara\n\u2019s prefab homes, which landed a $34 million investment this week.\nThe company was started by Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia and former Flex CEO Mike McNamara in 2016. Factory-made homes, or panelized housing, is taking off in places such as the Palisades and Altadena, as builders and homeowners look to alternative materials that speed up timelines to getting back home.\n\u201cWe expect LA to pick up quite a bit on the back of the fires and because of the products that we\u2019re deploying there,\u201d McNamara, Samara\u2019s CEO, told\nThe Real Deal\nthis week, after his firm announced the $34 million Series B closing led by Thrive Capital.\nSamara turned heads in February when it partnered with Rick Caruso\u2019s nonprofit\nSteadfast LA\nto help expedite the recovery timeline. As part of that, Gebbia donated $15 million toward giving homes to fire survivors without the means to rebuild their homes.\nAt least 100 homes are expected to be built through that partnership, and a separate organization is handling recipient selection. A \u201chandful\u201d of homeowners have so far been identified in Pasadena and Altadena, and Samara is assisting them with permitting, McNamara said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a careful process that our partner is going through,\u201d said McNamara, who was unable to provide a figure on how many property owners have been selected. \u201cThey do want to make sure that we\u2019re gifting it to people that need it most. So, the process takes a little bit of time.\u201d\nThe installations take four to six weeks. Factoring in site preparation and utility hookups, the whole process takes two to three months. The first recipients\u2019 homes are expected to be in the ground by the end of the year.\nThe company\u2019s analysis of homes destroyed found that 600 spanned 1,000 square feet or less in Altadena, McNamara said. That\u2019s the sweet spot for Samara, which has a 950-square-foot model called the XL 10 with two bedrooms and two bathrooms.\n\nOther prefab players in the market include\nHapi Homes\n, which was in the design stage with 30 clients in Altadena and Pasadena as of August. RSG 3-D said 40 to 50 homeowners were working with architects expected to use the company\u2019s panelized materials to rebuild.\nADUs to boost multifamily\nRebuilding is one area of growth for Samara, but multifamily is ramping up the fastest as state and local policies shift in favor of adding density and increasing the housing supply.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been a continuous change in regulatory policy in California that they\u2019re allowing more and more of this density,\u201d McNamara said.\nA raft of changes this year have carved out exceptions in building codes in efforts to speed rebuilding.\nThat kicked off with January\u2019s executive order from Gov. Gavin Newsom which allows an\nADU\nto be installed even without the primary home being issued a certificate of occupancy. The point is to make it easier to get impacted residents into housing while they rebuild their primary residences.\nBoosting multifamily are laws such as Senate Bill 684, which was effective last July, and Senate Bill 1123, rolled out this July. Both cut the environmental review required under the\nCalifornia Environmental Quality Act\nfor housing projects on qualifying lots in a bid to reduce the red tape around permitting.\nAs a result, Samara\u2019s seen plenty of work from multifamily owners, ranging from mom-and-pop businesses to large corporations with thousands of units in their portfolio.\n",

Rubicon bought the property from JRE Partners for $119.3 million with the help of an $81 million loan from Equitable Insurance Company. The price works out to $399,000 per unit.\nThe market-rate residential building, at 2823 18th Street, has studio, one- and two-bedroom units with an average rent of $3,812 per month. Amenities include in-unit laundry, a fitness center, a clubhouse, a rooftop terrace and a lounge, as well as 9,000 square feet of ground-floor retail. The property was 99 percent leased as of last month.\nRubicon made the purchase using its Rubicon Point II fund, which was designed to provide the company with the means to invest in distressed assets across the Bay Area. Rubicon has been looking into distressed properties and purchasing them at a lower rate than previous sales, per Multi-Housing News.\nThe ongoing artificial intelligence boom has been a factor in Rubicon\u2019s ramping up of its multifamily purchases, according to Multi-Housing News. A recent\nreport\nfrom CBRE backs up those hopes, with the firm predicting that more than 50,000 people could flock to the city to work in the growing AI sector.\n\nA handful of other multifamily properties in the Bay Area have traded hands in recent weeks.\nEarlier this week, Bridge Housing acquired the\nCanyon Ridge at Napa Junction\ncommunity in American Canyon in a $57 million deal. The Oakland-based firm picked up the 148-unit property from The Reliant Group with a 10-year $35 million acquisition loan from Capital One.\nPrior to that, an affiliate of Acacia Capital\npurchased the Waymark\napartments in Walnut Creek for $190 million. The 385-unit community was sold by developers Blake Griggs Properties and Transit Village Associates and features studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom units.\nBesides the Madelon multifamily property, Rubicon Point is the owner of the Fitzgerald apartments at 2750 19th Street in San Francisco.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Rabbi Shmuley Boteach lost his bid to toss out a defamation lawsuit accusing him of smearing Billionaire Jeff Soffer\u2019s Fontainebleau Miami Beach.\nOn Sept. 16, U.S. District Judge Michael Moore denied Boteach\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint, filed by the affiliate of Soffer\u2019s Aventura-based\nFontainebleau Development\nthat owns the iconic waterfront resort at 4441 Collins Avenue. The hotel\u2019s ownership entity is seeking punitive damages against Boteach, whose real name is Jacob Shmuel Botach.\nIn its December 2024 federal complaint, Fontainebleau Miami Beach alleges\nBoteach\nspent weeks falsely accusing the 1,504-key hotel\u2019s owner and staff on his social media accounts of condoning antisemitism after he was kicked out following a verbal altercation he had with another resort guest over the Gaza War.\nA book author and social media influencer with 1.2 million followers on multiple platforms, Boteach bills himself as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Rabbi\u201d and \u201cthe most famous rabbi in America.\u201d\n\u201cThe court\u2019s 13-page order speaks for itself,\u201d Sean Burstyn, principal of Burstyn Law representing Fontainebleau Miami Beach, told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cThe misconduct described therein is egregious, and we\u2019re fully confident that the jury will see it that way.\u201d\n\nJohn Benford, an attorney representing Boteach, declined comment.\nIn addition to denying Boteach\u2019s motion to dismiss, Judge Moore also rejected the rabbi\u2019s request that some of Fontainebleau\u2019s allegations be stricken from the court record. Among the allegations Boteach wanted removed included Fontainebleau\u2019s claim that the rabbi \u201cintensified his calls for the public to boycott the hotel on the basis\u2026that the hotel obstructed a police investigation into heinous statements hurled at him.\u201d\nBoteach\u2019s beef with\nFontainebleau Miami Beach\nstems from his argument with another hotel guest, a man of Arab descent, on Dec. 2, 2024, court filings show. The two men filmed each other while hurling insults. In a video clip uploaded to Boteach\u2019s Instagram account, the man called the rabbi a \u201c\u201cF*king baby killer.\u201d\nThe\nFontainebleau Miami Beach\ncomplaint alleges that Boteach\u2019s video did not include the rabbi making comments about suicide bombers and telling the other guest, \u201cAllahu Akbar? Are you going to blow yourself up or something?\u201d The lawsuit acknowledged that the other guest made heinous comments and \u201cother words that are easily interpreted as anti-Semitic.\u201d\nFontainebleau Miami Beach\u2019s management condemned the other man\u2019s behavior with a public statement shortly after the incident happened, the lawsuit noted. Boteach and the other guest were both banned from the resort.",

Gavin Newsom\u2019s desk, homeowners \u2014 as well as one of Newsom\u2019s key allies in state politics \u2014 are hoping he\u2019ll throw it in the trash.\nMembers of homeowners associations across Los Angeles are lobbying for Newsom\u2019s veto of the transit-oriented upzoning bill, Beverly Press\nreported\n.\nThe legislation, known as the Abundant and Affordable Homes Near Transit Act, was penned by San Francisco state Sen. Scott Wiener with the goal of addressing the state\u2019s affordable housing crisis by allowing developers to construct larger multi-unit residential buildings near transit stops.\nThe bill would permit the construction of up to nine stories for buildings adjacent to certain bus stops and train stations, seven stories for buildings within a quarter-mile of the stops and six stories for buildings within a half-mile. Single-family neighborhoods within a half-mile of transit stops would be subject to the new zoning rules.\nLos Angeles\nMayor Karen Bass\nisn\u2019t too hot on the\ndensity-increasing legislation\n. On Wednesday, Bass appealed directly to Newsom asking him to veto the bill, Larchmont Buzz\nreported\n.\n\u201cWhile I support the intent to accelerate housing development statewide, as written, Senate Bill 79 risks significant unintended consequences for many of Los Angeles\u2019 diverse communities,\u201d Bass wrote.\n\nAt issue is the perceived state control of local zoning decisions.\n\u201cWe must create more housing near transit hubs and areas with access to jobs, education, and amenities. We must streamline the production of housing for all Angelenos. However, we must do so in a way that does not erode local control, diminish community input on planning and zoning, and disproportionately impact low-resource neighborhoods,\u201d Bass wrote in her letter to the governor. \u201cThe City of Los Angeles has already made substantial efforts to align with state housing goals and increase housing development citywide, and will continue to do so.\u201d\nUnder the amended bill, counties with more than 15 high-frequency train or bus stops would be eligible for the upzoning. That touches just seven counties across the state: Alameda, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara. An amendment to legislation gave\nContra Costa County\na pass from the upzoning.\nNewsom has until Oct. 13 to decide whether to sign, veto or do nothing with SB 79.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The prior owners, Inland Real Estate, gave it up via a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.\nBut Nuveen hasn\u2019t necessarily overpaid either. Inland bought the property for $154 million in 2006 before the Great Recession led to several store closings and ultimately Inland\u2019s default.\nThe Red Mountain venture spent the last few years on a $30 million plan to bring the once struggling shopping center back to life.\nThe California-based company quickly attracted new tenants including The Fresh Market, Bob\u2019s Discount Furniture and a Twin Peaks restaurant. Over the past four years, the shopping center has gone from 75 to 95 percent occupied, the Northwest Herald reported. The firm put the property on the market late last year.\nNewmark\u2019s Bill Bauman, Kyle Miller, Keely Polczynski and Conor Lalor represented Red Mountain and F&amp;F in the sale.\n\nThe suburban commercial real estate market is facing distinct highs and lows.\nChicago\u2019s suburban multifamily market is\none of the strongest in the country\nwith investment sales jumping 65 percent at the start of the year, according to Interra Realty.\nThe multifamily sector\u2019s success is in stark contrast to the suburban office market which is still\nstruggling to recover from the pandemic\n. The broader suburban market had a direct vacancy rate of 20 percent in the second quarter (up from 15 percent in 2019) and overall vacancy rate of 26 percent, according to Transwestern.\nThe farther flung suburbs are also\nemerging as hubs for data centers\nand other industrial developments.\nMeanwhile, retail sales have been more of a mixed bag.\nSeveral indoor shopping malls have seen massive declines in value over the past decade, but a series of revitalization efforts, including transformations into mixed use developments, have taken hold across the region.\nAt least five\nmalls\nacross Chicagoland are undergoing large-scale redevelopments.",

Lima, Peru-based Grupo T&amp;C\u2019s 56-story, 608-unit project is planned for the 0.6-acre site at 1825 Northeast 4th Avenue, formerly 1837 Northeast 4th Avenue.\nRecords show an affiliate of Grupo T&amp;C bought the site for an undisclosed price in 2012.\nUnits will range from studios to three bedrooms, from 410 square feet to 1,200 square feet, and come fully furnished and designed by interiors firm Adriana Hoyos Design Studio, the release states. Amenities in the building will include a fitness center, spa facilities, two pools, co-working spaces, a podcast studio, a garden, playground and putting green.

        "content": "Related Midwest\u2019s 62-acre South Loop site The 78 is one step closer to approval and with it, Chicago Fire FC is approaching a Soldier Field exit.\nThe Chicago Plan Commission on Thursday approved rezoning for Related Midwest\u2019s 62-acre South Loop site, advancing plans for a $750 million, privately\nfinanced\nstadium at The 78 that would anchor an $8 billion mixed-use campus, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The 22,000-seat venue, targeted for completion by the 2028 season, would be the centerpiece of a long-stalled development that Related Midwest CEO Curt Bailey has been pitching since 2016.\nBailey told commissioners the project is a signal Chicago is \u201cback in so many ways,\u201d predicting thousands of jobs and a Wrigleyville-style entertainment district around the stadium. Fire\nowner\nJoe Mansueto would buy roughly 10 acres of the site for the stadium, while Related would retain control of surrounding development, including plans for 5,000-plus apartments, part of a multi-phased mixed-use district along the Chicago River south of Roosevelt Road, between the South Loop and Chinatown.\nThe rezoning still needs City Council zoning committee and full Council approval.\nAlderman Pat Dowell represents the 3rd Ward, where The 78 would be located. Dowel reiterated her\nbacking\nduring Thursday\u2019s meeting, calling the project exciting for the city and the 3rd Ward. She said her support is contingent on the Fire\u2019s stadium being the only stadium at the site \u2014 a reference to Related\u2019s parallel talks with the White Sox about relocating from Guaranteed Rate Field. The rezoning amendment approved Thursday includes language limiting The 78 to a single stadium unless new approvals are sought.\nThe Sox, who\nfloated\na ballpark concept for the site last year, have said they are keeping \u201call options open.\u201d\nTraffic and transit remain a sticking point. A study commissioned by the Fire and Related found game-day congestion would be less severe than weekday rush hour. The project caps large-scale events at 45 annually, including 17 Fire home matches.\n\n25th Ward Alderman Byron Sigcho-Lopez pressed for more community feedback, warning against rushing a massive redevelopment. Dowell countered that nine community meetings had been held and argued the city shouldn\u2019t stall a private investment on land that\u2019s sat vacant for half a century.\nStill is how much public money will be needed to upgrade infrastructure around the stadium. Related\u2019s 2019 redevelopment agreement called for up to $551 million in tax-increment financing for roads, bridges and transit, but Bailey has said a revised deal would trim costs by scrapping plans for a new CTA Red Line station and Metra track realignment.\nCity planning officials said talks over TIF reimbursements are in the early stages. Any revised agreement would need sign-off from the Community Development Commission and City Council Finance Committee \u2014 which Dowell chairs, giving her significant leverage over how much taxpayer support flows to the 78.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The agency dismissed the complaint this week after the firm agreed to new housing policies, staff training and five years of compliance reporting. The developer admitted no wrongdoing.\nAs part of the deal, Community Capital Partners must udpate its sales and marketing materials, adopt nondiscriminatory housing standards and avoid using any applicant criteria not tied directly to business necessity. The firm is also required to implement written fair housing procedures subject to state approval.\nDespite the regulatory scrutiny, Community Capital Partners said it is forging ahead with the $400 million, 402-acre project near Josephine in Collin and Hunt counties. Plans call for more than 1,000 homes alongside a mosque, K-12 Islamic school, apartments, senior housing, retail, healthcare clinics, sports facilities and a community college.\n\u201cWe welcomed the opportunity to take a deep dive into the Fair Housing Act,\u201d Imran Chaudhary, the developer\u2019s president, said in a statement, framing the settlement as a chance to strengthen the project.\nThe resolution comes after political attacks on EPIC City reached a fever pitch this spring, during the Texas legislative session. Governor Greg Abbott has repeatedly accused the group of trying to create \u201cSharia compounds\u201d and said as many as a dozen agencies are investigating.\n\nBut, so far, the attacks have fallen flat. The\nU.S. Department of Justice closed\nits own civil rights investigation into the project in June.\nAbbott, however, signaled the state isn\u2019t finished, keeping EPIC City at the center of a culture-war flashpoint that has now bled into real estate development.\nHe\nsigned a new law\nover the summer \u2014 House Bill 4211 \u2014 aimed at blocking the business structure behind EPIC City, a move the developers and their attorney blasted as fearmongering.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nauseating to my very core that an elected official \u2026 is lying to Texans,\u201d attorney Dan Cogdell told the outlet.\nThe law requires new disclosure and ownership rules for business entities selling interest in shared real estate ventures.

        "content": "Russell Galbut\u2019s GFO Investments teamed up with InSite Group, Atlas Hill Real Estate and Prime Finance to buy Galleria Fort Lauderdale, sources told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe partnership closed on the 800,000-square-foot indoor mall at 2414 East Sunrise Boulevard, according to sources familiar with the transaction. The buyers plan on redeveloping\nGalleria Fort Lauderdale\nwith detailed plans to be unveiled in the combining months, a press release states.\nGalbut called the property \u201can incredible site\u201d that\u2019s two blocks from the ocean.\n\u201cA transaction like this comes about once in a lifetime,\u201d he told\nTRD\n. \u201cWe\u2019re going to reinvent the mall and make it magical like all of the other projects we work on.\u201d\nA source told\nTRD\nthe partnership paid at least $90 million for the property. The partnership declined to comment on the price.\nThe deal marks another redevelopment play for builders\ntargeting older shopping centers\n. In Cutler Bay, Electra America and BH Group are redeveloping portions of Southland Mall into the\n$1 billion\nSouthplace City Center. The planned mixed-use project could ultimately have 4,395 apartments and condos, a 150-room hotel, 60,000 square feet of medical office space, 150,000 square feet of retail outparcels and a community amphitheater.\nA CBRE team led by Robert Given and Brad Capas marketed Galleria on behalf of the seller, Keystone-Florida Holding Corporation, led by president William O\u2019Connor. In 1993, Keystone-Florida paid $25.1 million for Galleria Fort Lauderdale.\n\nThe mall hit the market in 2023 with a targeted sale price of more than\n$100 million\n. At the time, the property was 67 percent occupied, according to an offering memorandum.\nFort Lauderdale-based\nInSite\nis led by Ben Shmuel and Ronald Tercer. Atlas Hill is led by Sandeep Mathrani and Prime Finance is led by John Atwater.\nGalbut\u2019s\nMiami-based\nGFO\nand InSite will oversee redevelopment of Galleria Fort Lauderdale, while Atlas Hill Real Estate\u2019s Mathrani will focus on operations and repositioning the mall, the press release states.\nGalleria Fort Lauderdale, which opened in 1980, consists of multiple retail buildings, primarily empty big box stores that were previously occupied by Saks Fifth Avenue, Lord &amp; Taylor and Neiman Marcus. The joint venture\u2019s purchase did not include a Dillard\u2019s department store building, which is separately owned, and a Macy\u2019s store that has a ground lease.\nKeystone-Florida\nunsuccessfully tried to redevelop Galeria Fort Lauderdale twice, most recently in 2022. The firm proposed a mixed-use project with at least 1,900 apartments on the 31.6-acre site. But the city of Fort Lauderdale did not approve it.\nThe property\u2019s current zoning allows for 60 units per acre, or a maximum of 1,899 units. The maximum height for buildings is 150 feet.\nKatherine Kallergis contributed reporting.\n",

        "content": "Financier and Milwaukee Brewers minority owner Robert Beyer and his wife struck a deal to sell their Brentwood estate for $44 million.\nWhen factoring in off-market deals, the trade is the largest in Brentwood since the December 2021 sale of\n13058 Rivers Road\n, which went for $56.6 million.\nFriday\u2019s closing takes the home, which is named\n\u201cOcho Manos\u201d\nafter the couple\u2019s four children, off the market two years after hanging up the for-sale sign.\nThe Beverly Hills Estates\u2019\nJack Harris and Michael Fahimian\nnegotiated the deal on behalf of the buyer.\nHarris and Fahimian declined to comment on the trade or their client.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019 Drew Fenton and Andrew Beyer, who is the Beyers\u2019 son, were the listing agents. Carolwood also declined to comment on the deal.\nThe purchase price equates to $2,200 per square foot.\n\nOcho Manos hit the market in 2023, with a $75 million asking price. The price was cut a few times, most recently in June, when the asking price went to $54.9 million.\nRobert Beyer bought the first of three parcels comprising the estate in 2000, paying $438 per square foot or $8.8 million, according to listing sites. He reportedly went on to snap up three other sites and then took about five years across design and construction before the home was completed in 2005.\nHe told the Wall Street Journal in 2023 he and his wife \u201ccan\u2019t possibly enjoy the extent\u201d of the grounds with their four children grown and out of the house.\nThe Bob Ray Offenhauser-designed home, which sits on about 3.5 acres of flat land, was built by high-end homebuilder Peter McCoy Construction.\nThe residence spans 20,000 square feet with eight bedrooms and 14 bathrooms.\nImported stone, steel windows and doors, infinity edge pool and cabana, 1,200-bottle wine cellar, game room, gardens and tennis court are among the estate\u2019s highlights.\n",

        "content": "If it trades near its $7.9 million asking price, William and Shelley Farley\u2019s sprawling East Lake Shore Drive co-op will notch the priciest sale on Chicago\u2019s Gold Coast strip in at least six years and also mark the second trophy deal in the area to close after multimillion-dollar price cuts.\nThe 12,000-square-foot unit at 209 East Lake Shore Drive spans two combined apartments, with seven bedrooms, eight bathrooms and interiors designed by architect Larry Booth, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The scale is unusual even for East Lake Shore Drive, where developer John Buck and his wife\noffloaded\ntheir 21-room co-op this spring at $4.9 million \u2014 less than half their original $11.5 million ask. Like the Bucks, the Farleys slashed their price before heading toward a deal, originally listing the 15-room, 14th floor apartment for just under $16 million in 2023. The most recent price\nslash\non the listing was in June.\nA sale is contingent, and a reminder that East Lake Shore Drive still commands top-dollar cachet,\nafter\nsome price-chopping. Jeff Lowe, the Compass agent who represented the sellers, said active interest in the property spiked this summer after the price chop. The property was put under contract Sept. 16.\nBill Farley, financier and former CEO of Fruit of the Loom, who now runs private equity firm Liam Ventures, told the Chicago Tribune in 2023 that the apartment is situated for lakeside views.\n\u201cThe ceilings are 11-feet high. There are these huge windows, and, of course, there are no obstructions, and these views are incredible, not just for Chicago but for any major city in America,\u201d Farley told the outlet.\nThe apartment also features six fireplaces, a custom-paneled library, an office, family room and a temperature-controlled wine room, as well as a gym, two guest apartments and four garage spaces.\n\nFarley, 82, was a larger-than-life CEO whose 15-year run atop Fruit of the Loom made him a staple of Chicago business lore. The New York Times once dubbed him the \u201chunky chief executive\u201d after he starred in his own underwear ads and floated political ambitions. At its peak, Fruit of the Loom was a $2 billion brand, but Farley was ousted in 1999 amid questions over lavish pay and poor factory oversight.\nThe Farleys previously owned, though never personally occupied, a 9,000-square-foot rehabbed Gold Coast mansion at the corner of Burton Place and Astor Street. The couple also keep a residence in Kennebunkport, Maine.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The couple sold the house for $47.5 million, which was less than the $49 million asking price, but it was believed to be the\nmost-expensive\nresidential transaction of all time in Marin County.\n\nBuilt in 1895 by a wealthy San Francisco banker, C.O. Perry, the home has five bedrooms and 8.5 bathrooms, a rose-cutting garden and a swimming pool with a vine-covered pergola. It features unobstructed 270-degree views of the San Francisco city skyline, the Golden Gate and Bay bridges, Angel Island and the bay.\nThe home\u2019s 9,235 square feet includes 8,155 square feet in the main residence, a 600-foot guest house and a 480-square-foot pool house, per floor plans on Ward\u2019s website.\n\u201cPeople in that price range are looking for specific things,\u201d Matt Hughes, president of the Marin Association of Realtors in 2015, told the Marin Independent Journal that year. \u201cLocksley is appealing because of its historic significance and its tax status.\u201d\nLocksley was restored to historical standards, qualifying it for the California Mills Act property tax reduction program, Hughes said.\n",

Buildout of the campus will support about 12,000 construction jobs and bring more than 3,500 manufacturing jobs once the plant is up and running within the next five years, Connect CRE\nreported\n.\nIn 2021, the South Korean company announced that its\nsecond U.S. factory\nwould be in Taylor \u2014 a town of about 18,000 some 34 miles north of Austin in Williamson County. Since then, the prospect of the 6-million-square-foot factory has spurred\nresidential and commercial development\nin the area, known as the \u201c\nSamsung effect\n.\u201d\nAt the time, about\n$981 million in incentives\nfrom local and state authorities were used to lure the factory, including a 30-year property-tax abatement from the city. Samsung will still pay Taylor a projected $52 million in taxes, which will go into the city general fund. The company will also invest in about $6 million in buildings and $11 million in machinery in the town.\nAccording to a news release from Governor Greg Abbott\u2019s office, the state grant will help support \u201ca more secure domestic supply of chips for critical U.S. industries.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith approximately $40 billion invested in Texas, Samsung is helping to cement Texas\u2019 position as the leading state for semiconductor manufacturing, bringing in more business investment to Texas communities and creating thousands of good-paying jobs for hardworking Texans,\u201d Abbott said.\nAbbott signed the Texas CHIPS Act into law in 2023. The legislation established the grant program, aimed at growing the state\u2019s efforts in semiconductor design, research and manufacturing.\nWork on the facility should be complete in 2026.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Wednesday was an unparalleled day in recent memory of New York City real estate news.\nThe morning began with the bust-up of two casino bids in Manhattan. First, a Community Advisory Committee\nvoted 4-2\nto disapprove SL Green\u2019s pitch for a $5.4 billion casino in Times Square, meaning the proposal will not move on to the final round of the state\u2019s casino licensing competition.\nAfter the meeting was over, SL Green CEO Marc Holliday stood up and chastised the committee members, besides those appointed by the mayor and governor, the sole yes votes.\n\u201cWhat you did here today was a despicable display of cowardice, lack of leadership, lack of consideration for all the people who would benefit from this proposal,\u201d Holliday shouted at the members as they filed out of the room.\nMoments later, Holliday\u2019s firm was joined in rejection by Silverstein Properties.\nA six-member Community Advisory Committee\nrejected\nits proposal for a casino at a \u201cgiant hole in the ground\u201d on 41st Street and 11th Avenue, in a 4 to 2 vote.\nSilverstein, alongside Rush Street Gaming and Greenwood Gaming &amp; Entertainment, pitched the Avenir, a $7 billion casino complex planned for a long-vacant site. The project would have featured a 1,000-key Hyatt Hotel, as well as restaurants, bars and a 150-seat entertainment venue.\nThe developer also promised to fund the conversion of offices into 2,000 units of housing.\nThe dual rejections leave Soloviev Group as the lone casino competitor in Manhattan \u2014 the developer is slated to get a date before its CAC within the week.\n\nWednesday morning also brought the drama surrounding real estate investment trust Paramount Group to the forefront.\nRithm Capital\nagreed to acquire\nParamount Group for $1.6 billion, with plans to purchase the major office landlord\u2019s outstanding shares at $6.60 per diluted share.\nThe acquisition is a significant bet on the resurgence of office values, with Rithm CEO Michael Nierenberg expressing optimism about the office market and anticipated interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (more on that later).\nBut the deal comes amidst controversy surrounding Paramount Group\u2019s CEO, Albert Behler, including an SEC investigation into undisclosed payments and concerns about executive compensation and conflicts of interest.\nThe craze of the morning gave way to an afternoon with the development most likely to affect the largest swath of the industry: an interest rate cut.\nThe Federal Reserve\ncut its benchmark interest rate\nby a quarter point, the first such cut in nine months, though it was not as drastic as President Donald Trump desired.\nAhead of the meeting, real estate industry players aired their hopes that lower rates could stimulate commercial transactions and help address the housing affordability crisis.\nWhile mortgage rates recently dropped, they do not directly follow the Fed\u2019s interest rate changes and it\u2019s uncertain how much further they will fall.\nAnd all of that unfolded over the course of a few hours. Who said Wednesdays were boring?\n",

        "content": "New Yorkers have rent stabilization on the brain.\nIt\u2019s dominated headlines since the race for the city\u2019s next mayor kicked off last year, and\nZohran Mamdani\ncemented\nfreezing rents at these properties as a core tenet\nof his campaign ahead of his shock upset to clinch the\nDemocratic primary\n.\nMore New Yorkers are starting to wrap their heads around stabilization \u2014 a concept many outsiders long confused with ever-elusive rent-controlled units, a la Monica Geller\u2019s massive Greenwich Village apartment in \u201cFriends\u201d \u2014 and more are on the hunt to secure their own piece of the pie.\nData from OpenIgloo found that the share of users filtering for rent-stabilized apartment listings increased from just 10 percent in the summer months of 2024 to 35 percent the same time this year.\nThe platform recently launched its\nown map\nof rent-stabilized properties, which it claims is the first of its kind to track rent-regulated housing stock. Others are also jumping in on the action, including a startup called Realer Estate, which uses an algorithm to identify apartments that are likely rent-stabilized.\nFor lifelong or well-seasoned New Yorkers, the conversation about rent stabilization and its prevalence across the five boroughs is likely nothing new. Finding and keeping affordable apartments in a city that only continues to get more expensive (a bacon, egg and cheese in Manhattan can now run $11.50, according to\none Reddit user\n) is a quest many are all too familiar with.\nThe renewed conversation about rent-stabilization arising from the mayoral race is likely catching a fresh crop of New Yorkers (potentially transplants from other cities) up to the idea, especially as market-rate rents\ncontinue to rise\n.\nRent-burdened residents on the lookout for their own sweet deal might look to\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\ncoverage and see finding the rent-regulated apartment is only half the battle \u2014 what condition it will be in over your years of living in it is another, as rent-stabilized owners are\ngrappling with rising costs\nand falling income, making it difficult to keep up with necessary improvements.\nNot so fast\u2026\nThough Manhattan\u2019s trophy market is tumbling, luxury business in the suburbs is on the up-and-up.\n\nEarlier this week, hotelier Ian Schrager, known as the co-founder of Studio 54, listed his 12-acre estate in Westchester County for\n$7.5 million\n, up from its $5 million purchase price more than a decade ago.\nSchrager is seeking to offload the property on the tails of a hot streak in the tri-state area, which logged a three-year record deal in New Jersey, a top-dollar trade in the Hamptons and a boom in trophy sales in Greenwich, Connecticut.\nIn the wealthy enclave of Alpine, a Versailles-inspired mansion sold last week for\nnearly $18 million\n, marking the priciest deal in New Jersey since 2022. The deal for the seven-bedroom home grabbed headlines even though it fell short of its initial asking price of $25 million when it hit the market four years ago.\nIn East Hampton, video game developer Matthew Karch dropped\n$32 million\non an oceanfront home on Lily Pond Lane. The deal marked the first for the property since the sellers, Norman and Helene Stark, bought it for $5 million in 1994. The Starks originally sought $75 million for the two-acre estate in 2017, though they later cut the asking price to $39 million.\nMeanwhile, Greenwich\u2019s luxury market\nlogged 25 deals\nexceeding $10 million since the start of the year, the most recorded since 1999. With so many sales already on the books this year, some anticipate the affluent Connecticut town could double its total from last year by the end of 2025.\nHowever, Manhattan\u2019s luxury market is charting a different course. Last week, the borough saw\njust 11 homes\nasking $4 million or more enter contract with zero of the properties asking more than $10 million. The slump came after four weeks of declining totals, though the Labor Day holiday likely contributed to the drop off.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe priciest deal to land in city records this week was for a co-op on the Upper East Side, which traded for $18 million. Investor Steven Wisch and his wife, filmmaker Debra Wisch, sold Unit 10 at\n1125 Fifth Avenue\n, where actress Bette Midler and Disney\u2019s Bob Iger once owned apartments, to a trust tied to a Westport, Connecticut, address.\nThe full-floor co-op spans roughly 4,600 square feet and has four bedrooms and four bathrooms. Douglas Elliman\u2019s Sabrina Saltiel had the listing.\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s a strange day when a state agency proposes a court order restricting itself.\nBut that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened at the Office of Cannabis Management, in a situation that lays bare the mismanagement and ineptitude at the heart of New York\u2019s dispensary rollout.\nNew Yorkers often complain about bureaucratic incompetence, but OCM seems to have other agencies beat.\nIn its most recent scandal, the office came out and said it had been enforcing the law incorrectly. As a result, 152 planned or approved cannabis dispensaries may have to close or relocate. Eighty-four percent of those are in New York City.\nAt issue was how the office had been measuring the distance between dispensaries and schools and other locations. Instead of measuring from the property line, as required by law, OCM had been measuring from the front entrance.\n\u201cWhen I found out about it, I was very angry, to say the least,\u201d Gov. Kathy Hochul\nsaid last month\n. \u201cThat\u2019s a major screw up.\u201d\nA group of affected dispensaries, including nonprofit darling Housing Works, sued OCM and the Cannabis Control Board to stop the change. A judge denied the motion for a temporary restraining order without explanation.\nThat brings us up to last week, when state attorneys for OCM, clearly feeling the heat, proposed an order granting the plaintiffs\u2019 preliminary injunction.\n\u201cPlease order us to go back to the old standards,\u201d the attorneys are essentially saying. As of Friday at 4 p.m., the order has not been signed.\nIt\u2019s possible that the office is negotiating a settlement with the plaintiffs. OCM and its lawyers at the attorney general\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nIf you\u2019ve been following the cannabis rollout for any amount of time, this saga may not come as a shock. Since its inception, OCM has struggled to turn mission-driven platitudes into a functioning regulatory regime.\nLast year, the state issued a scathing internal review of the agency. Among the charges: Inexperienced leadership ran the agency like a policy startup. The report found that OCM required many dispensary applicants to execute a lease or purchase a property to apply for a license, while simultaneously having no intention of reviewing all the applications it received.\nWith this latest blunder, absent any court order or amended legislation, already-approved dispensaries will need to relocate. The Governor and office plan to introduce legislation to fix the issue, but the legislature is away until January. And it\u2019s uncertain what state lawmakers will agree to.\nOCM has offered up to $250,000 in relief to affected applicants who were approved but not given final licenses.\nBut in the world of commercial real estate, especially for businesses operating in violation of federal law, that\u2019s not a lot of money. Landlords taking a risk working with dispensaries typically want premium rent in return.\n\u201cThere are so many things that go into locking down real estate, particularly in New York and particularly in an industry that\u2019s so highly regulated and volatile,\u201d said Fatima Afia, a cannabis lawyer at Rudick Law Group. \u201c$250,000 doesn\u2019t really cover much of anything for the folks who have gone through a lot of the process already to lock down a lease and maybe sign a personal guarantee.\u201d\n\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nHow are retail landlords thinking about dispensaries, both legal and, uh, unofficial? Drop me a line at\nlilah.burke@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nNew York has a professional bull riding team, the Mavericks. Last year, the team made its debut in the Professional Bull Riding league at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. They started this season on Thursday at UBS Arena in Elmont, New York and are there until Saturday.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014\nMayor Adams\u2019 office released a\nreport\nFriday on the economic benefits of each casino proposal vying for a downstate license. The plan from Soloviev, which is slated for a committee vote on Monday, bested the others when it came to job creation numbers, with 17,907 direct construction jobs and 2,736 permanent jobs. The proposal by Mets owner Steve Cohen outside Citi Field, however, topped the list for tax revenue.\n\u2014 The mayor has been running a \u201chard on crime\u201d re-election campaign. But although crime categories may be down year over year, they are still significantly up compared to 2019, the New York Times\nnoted\n. Murders are up 22 percent, felony assaults are up 30 percent and car thefts have more than doubled.\n\u2014 The MTA is moving to acquire more lots through eminent domain for its Second Avenue Subway expansion, the City\nreported\n.\nClosing time:\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$10 million\nfor a co-op unit at 1120 Fifth Avenue in Lenox Hill. Tod Mercy and Jamaal Redon of The Corcoran Group\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$47.5 million\nfor a 9,555-square-foot piece of vacant land at 358 Broadway in Tribeca.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$20 million\nfor a 5,344-square-foot townhouse at 238 West 11th Street in the West Village. Roberta Golubock with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty has the listing.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s office vacancy rate has never been higher, but the market tells two very different stories. Companies hunting for high-rise space in trophy towers are finding competition fierce and rents rising, even as older buildings drown in availability.\nDowntown\u2019s overall direct vacancy hit 24.3 percent midway through the year, but much of that space was either outdated or controlled by landlords too tied up with debt to make competitive deals, Crain\u2019s\nreported\nciting data from Colliers. Strip the\ndata\ndown to the market\u2019s best properties, and the supply picture changes dramatically: Class A availability is 19 percent, trophy buildings are at 11.4 percent, and on floors above the 25th level, vacancy drops to just 8.4 percent.\nThat\u2019s what Goldman Ismail Tomaselli Brennan &amp; Baum discovered when the firm went looking for space last year. Partner Andrew Rima expected a tenant\u2019s market with pandemic-era bargains but instead faced a crowded field for well-located, modern offices. The firm ended up taking a floor-and-a-half at 191 North Wacker Drive.\n\u201cIt was more competitive than the headlines suggested,\u201d Rima told the outlet.\nAverage gross asking rents across downtown have barely budged since 2020, according to Colliers. At the top end, however, trophy rents have soared 26 percent to nearly $66 per square foot per year. For a small office footprint of 2,000 square feet, that\u2019s a base of $11,000 a month.\n\nSpace in the city\u2019s priciest towers \u2014 110 North Wacker Drive, 150 North Riverside Plaza and 444 West Lake Street \u2014 is hitting $80 to $90 per foot with taxes and expenses included, brokers say. Meanwhile, tenants at older Class B towers can still strike renewals for less than half that cost.\nThat split is shaping a stampede. Buildings like 155 and 191 North Wacker Drive and 300 North LaSalle Street have soaked up swaths of vacancy as firms\njockey\nfor well-located, modern space that will coax employees back in person. Even renewals are competitive, with multiple tenants circling the same suites, Colliers\u2019 vice chair David Burden told the outlet.\nGenerous concessions are common among landlords, such as free rent, cash for build-outs and other perks, especially for creditworthy firms willing to sign long leases. That restraint stems partly from lingering uncertainty about shrinking\nfootprints\nand leasing volumes well below pre-pandemic levels. Many landlords are cutting office space out of the market with an\nuptick\nin office-to-residential conversion projects in the works.\nDevelopers are even testing the waters for new towers. Related Midwest, Hines and John Buck are all shopping plans for West Loop high-rises that would require pre-leases at more than $100 per foot to land financing.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The store will be open until January.\nIt\u2019s a symbolic blow to the luxury brand and the struggling 1.4 million-square-foot shopping center, the last enclosed mall built in Texas. Willow Bend debuted in 2001 with Neiman\u2019s as the anchor but has been plagued by sluggish traffic despite heavy, multi-million dollar reinvestment over the years.\nCentennial, which bought the property in 2022, has been working on a multi-year redevelopment strategy, pivoting to\nmixed-use\nafter Macy\u2019s announced earlier this year it would close its Willow Bend location as part of a broader retrenchment.\nThe redevelopment is expected to take years and include apartments, hotel, office, restaurants, retail and townhomes. Plano city officials gave their stamp of approval on the project earlier this year.\n\nThe metroplex is a core market for Neiman Marcus, with stores at NorthPark Center, Downtown Dallas and in Fort Worth, Saks Global said. But each is under review. The historic downtown flagship narrowly\navoided\na March shutdown after tense lease negotiations, and Saks has\npledged\na \u201creimagination\u201d of that site alongside upgrades at NorthPark.\nCompany officials framed the Plano exit as part of aligning with Centennial\u2019s vision for the property. Employees will be offered transfers to other stores or separation packages.\nCentennial is pitching its overhaul of Willow Bend as a way to finally make the shopping center relevant to the surrounding community. The loss of another anchor might make the redevelopment push more urgent \u2014 and potentially easier, as it clears the way for a large-scale reset of the site.\nCentennial is also in the second phase of a $252 million\nredevelopment\nof the 1970s-era Hawthorn Mall in the Chicago suburb of Vernon Hills.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Ray Washburne is set to squeeze more money out of the City of Dallas by way of a land deal for its planned $3.5 billion convention center redevelopment.\nThe Highland Park Village owner already sold the former Dallas Morning News headquarters at 508 Young Street to the city for $45.1 million earlier this summer, outplaying city management with a\ngambit\nto sell it to a data center operator. He paid $28 million for the property in 2019, putting the gain at 46 percent minus holding costs over six years.\nNow the city wants another piece of the former Dallas Morning News property that Washburne owns, and it\u2019s\ntrying to take it by eminent domain\n. City attorneys filed a \u201ccondemnation\u201d lawsuit over the 36,000-square-foot parcel, a parking lot between the old newspaper building and WFAA\u2019s headquarters, after the city couldn\u2019t strike a $6.5 million deal that would\u2019ve paid Washburne $181 per square foot for the parcel, which was included in his $28 million purchase.\nEminent domain cases are supposed to find the fair market value of property that a government entity wants to buy. Recent high-profile examples include the Alamo Trust and City of San Antonio\u2019s effort to seize a bar near the Alamo by eminent domain. In that case, Vince Cantu, the former owner of\nMoses Rose\u2019s Hideout\n, was paid $6.75 million in the city\u2019s eminent domain lawsuit after he rejected offers of $4 million and $6 million.\nTo Washburne, who recently\ncombined his family real estate office\nwith his wife\u2019s, $750,000 would be a rounding error. But the holdout is a major power play for the charismatic businessman.\nHere\u2019s what else happened in Texas real estate this week.\n\nWho doesn\u2019t want an\nH-E-B supermarket\nin their backyard? These neighbors in Northeast Dallas who say the proposed lot the San Antonio-based grocer wants to build on is too small and the development will cause too much traffic.\nThe Texas Legislature deregulated\n\u201cAg shacks\u201d\nin College Station, overriding a local ordinance that aimed to limit how many students can live in one house.\nA historic ranch outfitted for cutting horses hit the market recently for $21 million. The\n900-acre property in Bosque County\n, about an hour and a half from Dallas, was the homestead of James \u201cBuck\u201d Barry, a Texas Ranger, Confederate veteran and former state legislator.\nThe battle over Texas\u2019 law banning \u201ctraveling\u201d housing finance corporations\ngot messier\n.\nA Denver-based investor expanded its\n\u201cRodeo Belt\u201d multifamily portfolio\nwith a purchase in Austin, where there is hope that the apartment slump could swing back in a couple of years.\nMeanwhile in Cowtown, the first condos in the Seven at Bowie House, an Auberge-branded property in Fort Worth\u2019s Cultural District, are\nhitting the market\n. A unit in the development is listed for $5.5 million, or $2,000 per square foot.\n",

        "content": "He may be pushing 90, but Harry Macklowe is still mad for real estate.\nThe prolific developer just closed a deal to redevelop a 1920s-era apartment building on Madison Avenue into ultraluxury condos. Macklowe bought the limestone and brick building at\n809 Madison\non the Upper East Side\u2019s \u201cGold Coast\u201d from Churchill Real Estate Holdings for $49 million, sources told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThat\u2019s a discount from the $55 million Churchill originally paid for the building in 2019, likely because it\u2019s a tricky project that\u2019s befuddled potential developers for a few years. The building, at the corner of East 68th Street, sits within the Upper East Side historic district and any changes to it would require approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission.\nMacklowe was able to get the LPC on board with his plans, sources said, which include using air rights he acquired to expand the building and convert it into large, 4,000-square-foot single-floor apartments. There will also be an expansive penthouse with a 1,500-square-foot terrace.\nHe is partnering with Abe and Scott Shnay\u2019s SK Development on the conversion, which will be designed by Robert A.M. Stern and SLCE Architects. Apartments are expected to sell for more than $20 million.\nRepresentatives for Macklowe and Churchill could not be immediately reached for comment..\nInfinite Global Partners, led by former Silverstein Properties CEO Marty Burger, and Related Funds provided a construction loan. Sculptor Capital Management and Circle Property Partners are providing preferred equity, and a handful of family offices, small funds and ultra-high-net-worth investors are coming in as limited partners.\n\nMichael Campbell of the Carlton Group arranged the financing.\nMacklowe, who turned 88 in August, last kicked off a new Manhattan development project a decade ago when he bought One Wall Street for $585 million. The $2 billion conversion project has had its ups and downs, and after a period of slow sales has seen\nan increase in contracts\n.\nEarlier this year, he sold a Midtown office building that had been part of his Tower Fifth development site, apparently relinquishing his long-held plan to develop a supertall office tower on the site.\nYet while things may be a bit slower on the development front, he certainly hasn\u2019t been quiet. Macklowe\u2019s grabbed headlines with a high-profile divorce in 2018 and a lengthy\nlegal battle\nwith CIM Group, his partner on 432 Park.\nHe sued the Israel Discount Bank of New York earlier this year, trying to stop the lender from foreclosing on his stakes in a pair of real estate investment trusts.\nIn Florida, he\u2019s partnering with Jorge P\u00e9rez\u2019s Related Group to build a\ntwo-tower condo project\nin North Bay Village.\n",

        "content": "The desolate and distressed\nSan Francisco Centre\n, once a Westfield mall before its owners handed back the keys, stands in stark contrast to Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield\u2019s outdoor shopping center in Century City.\nThe San Francisco mall, owned by Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield and Brookfield Properties until the two entities stopped making payments on a $558 million note and then bailed, is now worth less than $200 million.\nThat means the shopping center is worth a billion dollars less than it was nine years ago. It isn\u2019t hard to see why: the 1.5 million square foot retail spot is only seven percent occupied. And the lender wants the shopping complex off its books and to recoup some of what it is owed immediately, per special servicer commentary.\nThe Westfield Century City doesn\u2019t compare. Its owner was recently\nset to close\na $925 million commercial mortgage-backed securities refinancing \u2014 and an appraisal a couple months ago put the Los Angeles mall\u2019s value at $2 billion. Plus, it is nearly 96 percent occupied.\nTime to surrender?\nDoes Rockwood Capital have time to save the Santa Monica Clock Tower? That\u2019s the question\nThe Real Deal\nposed last month after learning the Art Deco office building that was once the city\u2019s largest skyscraper saw its\nvalue slashed\nand its debt land in special servicing.\nBut it appears Rockwood is ready to surrender. Special servicer commentary said: \u201cBorrower has expressed interest to transfer title back to the Lender,\u201d per Morningstar Credit.\nThe century-old Santa Monica Clock Tower was recently appraised at $27.4 million compared to $49 million at loan issuance. That was after the $26.7 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan connected to the offices went to\nspecial servicing\nand missed its maturity date.\nOccupancy declined to 43 percent earlier this year compared to 100 percent at loan underwriting a decade ago \u2014 and the around 50,000 square foot property is not making enough money to pay off its debt.\n\nStill, handing the keys back may not be a done deal. The special servicer said it was evaluating all options.\nBuyer revealed\nWe knew Tishman Speyer was\nselling\na Beverly Hills office building for more than $200 million when we published the scoop earlier in the summer, but the buyer was a mystery. Now we know it is none other than Kilroy Realty \u2014 and according to a person familiar, the deal, coming out to about $707 a square foot, was a competitive process.\nThe publicly traded real estate investment trust\npurchased\nthe offices for $205.3 million \u2014 a debut in the affluent area for Los Angeles-based Kilroy Realty, and an exit for Tishman Speyers from a trio of Beverly Hills office properties purchased two decades ago. Tishman Speyer cashed in all three in the past year or so, all at a profit.\nThe latest, Maple Plaza, which was 75 percent leased, Kilroy Realty purchased via cash on hand and recent disposition proceeds. This comes after Kilroy Realty sold a Santa Monica office building for $40 million and teased another sale at a similar price next year during second quarter earnings.\nOn the scene\nCommercial real estate executives gathered for back-to-back events this week: a\nTRD\nroundtable conversation led by Editor-in-Chief Stuart Elliott and dinner at Mother Wolf Tuesday evening and a Bisnow conference the next morning downtown.\nTRD\u2019s\npanelists \u2014 Cityview\u2019s Sean Burton, Cain International\u2019s Larry Green, and Christie\u2019s International Real Estate\u2019s Aaron Kirman \u2014 discussed whether the tariff bark is worse than bite, Measure ULA pain and more (video coming soon, so stay tuned). Developer Leo Pustilnikov made an appearance at both events.\nThe other event \u2014 on the gutted 23rd floor of 601 S. Figueroa, the office tower Uncommon Developers\npurchased\nfrom Brookfield Properties for $210 million earlier this year \u2014 at times felt like a marketing opportunity and maybe could have focused more on downtown\u2019s homelessness problem but still offered thoughtful insights.\n",

The California-based seller had sunk $30 million into repositioning the 600,000-square-foot asset it picked up out of an eight-year-long bout with distress for $33 million.\nOn the South Side,\ninvestor Eliazer Tauber\n, who\u2019s tied to\nindicted New York attorney Mark Nussbaum\n, is facing $10 million in foreclosure suits. The complaints deepen questions about Tauber\u2019s financing web, which includes dozens of distressed multifamily properties.\nElsewhere on the South Side,\nChikoo Patel\u2019s multifamily firm CKO Real Estate\ncontinues to unravel. American Express filed suit against him this week, adding to a pile of lender claims targeting his troubled portfolio of properties throughout Illinois.\n\nDevelopment tensions are flaring on the North Side, where Edgewater and Uptown residents are\nplastering billboards and threatening lawsuits\nover a proposed Broadway upzoning. The measure would allow taller buildings and more commercial uses along the corridor, drawing fire from homeowners wary of density creep.\nIn Evanston, Will Hunter and Evan Meador\u2019s firm\nContinuum paid $31 million for the Church Street Plaza site\n, where it plans a 27-story apartment tower.\nT2 Capital\nprovided a $27 million loan for the deal, moving the long-discussed redevelopment closer to reality.\nMore luxury homeowners are feeling like\nnow is the time to test the market in Lake Geneva\n, where a waterfront mansion just hit the market at $8.5 million. The listing comes on the heels of\ntwo other lakefront homes that asked just under $10 million\nand found buyers within days.

The firms, which control the hotel portion of the property, argue the proposal risks their collateral.

Whisnant will work out of Maven\u2019s San Francisco headquarters, though she\u2019ll continue to fully operate in the East Bay as she has before, a representative for the company told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nMaven has 30 employees, and no positions will be eliminated. Whether there will be any consolidation in office space remains to be seen.\nThe executive team at Maven includes co-founders and principals Santino DeRose and Pam Mendelsohn as well as principal Catherine Meunier and Chicago team leader Lorraine Adney.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked alongside Nadine on many transactions and consistently found a natural alignment in how we approach clients and the business. Her depth of knowledge in the East Bay and throughout the greater Bay Area makes this an exciting opportunity to grow together,\u201d DeRose told\nThe Real Deal\n, touting Whisnant\u2019s \u201cstrong relationships with both well-known retailers and restaurateurs as well as with landlords.\u201d\nWhisnant founded Goldman Limited in 2000. Maven, founded in 2010 and expanding into Chicago in 2021, maintains a presence in upscale San Francisco retail neighborhoods like Hayes Valley, Cow Hollow, Upper Fillmore and\nUnion Square\n. The merger with Goldman will increase its presence in East Bay markets like\nBerkeley\n, Walnut Creek, Alameda and Lafayette.\nFarewell to a titan\nBay Area real estate mogul and prolific philanthropist\nThaddeus \u201cTad\u201d Taube\nhas died at the age of 94. The Polish-born giant died at his home in San Mateo County.\nTaube co-founded The Woodmont Companies, which went on to become one of the largest privately owned investment real estate companies on the West Coast.\nIn subsequent decades, he worked toward charitable causes through his Koret Foundation. In his home country, Taube founded and helped fund the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews in\nWarsaw\n.\nAcross the Bay Area, Taube funded projects such as an upgrade of the San Francisco Opera\u2019s performance space and the reinstallation of the Bay Bridge\u2019s \u201cBay Lights.\u201d He supported Stanford University athletics through the construction of the Taube Family Tennis Stadium and launched programs to connect at-risk youth with professional sports teams in the region. He also invested in health care initiatives like the Neurodegenerative Disease Research Collaborative and the Tad and Dianne Taube Pavilion at Stanford\u2019s children\u2019s hospital and efforts to address youth addiction, concussions, pediatric cancer and maternal and mental health.\n\u201cIf you were to draw a road map of my life, it would have multiple forks,\u201d he once said. \u201cI often find myself driving along several paths at the same time.\u201d\nEverything\u2019s coming up roses?\n\nSix years after its application for construction was approved, Kilroy Realty is offering a bouquet of different flowers for its\nplanned redevelopment\nof the old San Francisco Flower Market.\nThe Los Angeles-based firm filed a new application with a handful of options for development at the Central South of Market site that would increase housing and office capacity.\nOne version calls for five buildings with roughly 2.6 million square feet of office or lab space, up to 100,000 square feet of retail space, 300,000 square feet of institutional space and more than 800 parking spots. Another would apply the\nstate density bonus law\nto build seven buildings containing a total of 3,532 new homes as well as 100,000 square feet of retail space and more than 1,800 parking spaces.\nThe \u201cMixed-Use Variant\u201d would have 1,242 housing units as well as 1.5 million square feet of office or lab space, 100,000 square feet of commercial space and more than 1,000 parking spaces in five buildings, while the \u201cInstitutional Variant\u201d\u00a0 proposes roughly 1.4 million square feet of medical or institutional space, 1.2 million square feet for office and lab tenants, plus 100,000 square feet of retail and 431 parking spaces across five buildings.\nLivin\u2019 at the car wash\nA long-languishing\ncar wash in Lower Haight\ncould finally be scrubbed away in favor of residences.\nSan Francisco Supervisor Bilal Mahmood introduced legislation that would allow building projects to follow the code in place at the time a proposal application was initially filed, clearing the way for Irvine-based developer 4Terra Investments to move forward with its planned six-story, 203-unit building at 400 Divisadero Street, approved in 2017.\nThe\nTouchless Car Wash project\nhas been seemingly dead in the soapy water for nine years; building codes related to mechanical, electrical, plumbing, structural and energy change every three years. As a result, 4Terra has had to redesign its plans since it originally filed them.\nBy using the regulations in place in 2016, 4Terra is projected to save approximately $4 million on the project.\nA lucky break\nLast week\u2019s passage of Senate Bill 79 in the California legislature included a carveout affecting just one county in the whole state: Contra Costa.\nState Sen. Scott Wiener\u2019s SB 79 will only apply to counties with more than 15 high-frequency train or bus stops, leaving just seven counties in the whole state subject to the upzoning legislation; in the Bay Area, that includes Alameda, San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties.\nContra Costa County\navoided\nSB 79\u2019s enforcement with exactly 15 stations falling under the bill\u2019s permission for high-density zoning, including 12 Bay Area Rapid Transit stations and three Amtrak stations in Richmond, Martinez and Antioch.\nThe NIMBY win came after the Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors and city councilmembers in Lafayette and Orinda\nlobbied state lawmakers\nto advance the amendment, arguing that SB 79 would increase density along fire evacuation zones and put residents at risk.\n",

        "content": "The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point.\nThe reduction is not as substantial as some hoped, and it had already been priced into mortgage rates by the time the\nannouncement\nwas made last week.\nThe remaining market foe is inflation. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s causing the stickiness around long-term rates,\u201d said Robert Palmer, founder and CEO of LPT Realty, a Florida brokerage firm.\nStill, a drop is good news.\n\u201cRates are still better than they have been. I think the hope was we were going to see a sharp drop happening. We didn\u2019t get that,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need much more clear inflation data to drive down rates to the level that most consumers want.\u201d\nOverall, the rate cut will bring more buyers to the market. But first-time home buyers will just face more competition in a market that has a very limited supply of affordable homes.\nAna Bozovic, market analyst and broker-owner of Analytics Miami, wrote in her newsletter that wealth migration remains the driving force behind the real estate market\u2019s success.\n\u201cEven with [Fed chairman Jerome] Powell acknowledging inflation concerns, the likely trajectory is continued rate cuts. That means more liquidity, more buyers, and more momentum flowing directly into Miami real estate,\u201d she wrote.\nReal estate brokers tell me that even though mortgage rates aren\u2019t and won\u2019t be close to the high 2 percent and low 3 percent range seen just a few years ago, they do expect this cut to have a psychological effect.\nTop agents are also ready to pounce on ultra-wealthy buyers keeping an eye on whether Zohran Mamdani wins in New York in November.\nThe interest rate cuts, \u201cthey\u2019re going to help us even more,\u201d top broker Dora Puig says. \u201cAnd then let\u2019s watch what happens in New York with the mayoral campaign.\u201d\n\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWho bought the\nnon-waterfront house\nat 2301 North Bay Road?

        "content": "It goes without saying, but pictures or social media posts aren\u2019t always worth 1,000 words.\nThat rang particularly true this past week on a ride through parts of the Palisades with local brokerage owner Anthony Marguleas, founder of Amalfi Estates.\nThe takeaway: Anyone peddling only photos of uncleared, burned lots is selling a dated sense of reality. Construction is now the story for the Palisades as more and more builders enter the scene.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much misinformation,\u201d Marguleas told\nThe Real Deal\n(find more from that conversation in our upcoming October issue of the magazine). \u201cThere are a couple people online that are so politically charged, and I\u2019m not going to talk about the whole political conversation, but there\u2019s a couple individuals who are so anti-Mayor [Karen] Bass and so anti-[Gov. Gavin] Newsom and so conspiracy theorist. All I care about is our town being rebuilt.\u201d\nHe ticked off several items to dispute, but at the top of the list was the subject of permitting.\nCritics of Bass have long accused the city of a sluggish rebuild. Part of that may have been fueled in the early days beginning with the lack of clarity around a\ncontract\nawarded to the Chicago outfit\nHagerty Consulting\nin February for as much as $10 million. Questions around that still stand.\nHowever, in the community\u2019s Alphabet Streets alone, an increasing number of lots now bear frames of homes or are wrapped with the names of builders who are working.\nAs of Friday morning, there were 569 permits issued by the city of Los Angeles for 336 addresses, according to the Department of Building and Safety online dashboard. Another 720 plans have been approved with 769 in review.\nFor Marguleas, more of that information should be the norm rather than the noise of those shooting from the hip.\n\u201cI love data. Everything I have is backed up with data,\u201d Marguleas said. \u201cA lot of agents are just kind of willy-nilly with it, but everything I have is data.\u201d\nSamara\u2019s rebuild work\nNot a lot has been revealed on the progress of Steadfast LA and Airbnb spinoff Samara\u2019s planned donations to survivors of January\u2019s Palisades and Eaton fires since the February announcement of their partnership.\nIt took some time for homeowners to make decisions about whether they would stay or leave, for starters, Samara co-founder and CEO\nMike McNamara\ntold\nTRD\non Thursday. There have also been the more pragmatic realities, such as determining whether one of Samara\u2019s factory-made accessory dwelling units are the right fit for a lot.\nThe first home recipients, residing in Pasadena and Altadena, have been selected, and Samara\u2019s now moving forward on permitting, the CEO said.\n\nSamara closed $34 million in Series B funding led by Thrive Capital, which McNamara said is \u201cgrowth capital\u201d as the firm faces demand from wildfire survivors, multi-generational households and multifamily property owners.\nBig deal\nSome might cheer Friday afternoon\u2019s $44 million closing of a Brentwood estate as being yet another market bright spot following the January fires.\nThe deal on the home at 11740 Crescenda Street, which was named \u201cOcho Manos\u201d by its former owners, sold to a mystery buyer represented by the Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Michael Fahimian and Jack Harris.\nThe sellers, financier and Milwaukee Brewers minority owner Robert Beyer and his wife Catherine Beyer, had the 20,000-square-foot home custom built and reportedly sought $75 million for it in 2023. It was most recently listed for $54.9 million.\nCarolwood Estates co-founder and CEO Drew Fenton, along with Andrew Beyer, were the listing agents.\nThe closing makes Ocho Manos Brentwood\u2019s most-expensive sale since the off-market trade of 13058 Rivers Road in Brentwood. That property sold for $56.6 million in December 2021. Fenton was also the listing agent there, along with Compass\u2019 David Kramer. Tracy Tutor, now of Compass, represented the buyer.\n$110M hits peak popularity\nIf Bel-Air and Holmby Hills can do it, why not Malibu? The \u201cit\u201d in this would be closing on a $110 million home sale this year.\nSpelling Manor at\n594 South Mapleton Drive\nin Holmby Hills and\n630 Nimes Road\nin Bel-Air are tied for this year\u2019s priciest residential sales in Los Angeles County, with both estates going for $110 million.\nNow, the owners of 6962 Wildlife Road in Malibu are testing the price point in the seaside community, with the over 7,000-square-foot residence entering the market on Friday. The asking price is $15,530 per square foot.\nThe property \u2014 at one time owned by the king of late night, Johnny Carson \u2014 is\nreportedly\nbeing sold by August Tigrett, whose father Isaac Tigrett founded Hard Rock Cafe and House of Blues, and her husband Riaz Valani, the first investor in electronic cigarette maker Juul.\nIf sold, the home would be a big headline for Malibu after the $80 million sale of\n28719 Grayfox Street\n, which was recorded by the Los Angeles County Recorder\u2019s Office in late July.\n",

        "content": "Manhattan\u2019s debt markets didn\u2019t slow down in August as some of the city\u2019s biggest landlords lined up billions in fresh financing.\nThree blockbuster office refinancings topped the month\u2019s largest loans, led by the Durst Organization\u2019s\n$1.3 billion deal\nfor its Times Square tower. Paramount Group landed a $900 million loan for its Sixth Avenue tower just before the office landlord was\nsold to the highest bidder\n. On the residential side, lenders doled out dollars to Miki Naftali and Josh Gotlib and Meyer Orbach\u2019s recently-launched REIT.\nTogether, the deals totaled more than $4 billion and underscored lenders\u2019 appetite for prime Manhattan real estate. Here are the top five loans in Manhattan.\nDurst debt | $1.3B | Midtown\nWells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America\noriginated a $1.3 billion CMBS loan for the Durst Organization\u2019s One Five One office tower in Times Square. The loan, carrying a 6.1 percent interest rate, will pay off roughly $1.1 billion in existing debt on the 1.8 million-square-foot tower at 151 West 42nd Street. It will fund nearly $40 million in reserves and closing costs, according to an S&amp;P Global report.\nThe deal includes a $719 million \u201cA\u201d note that earned a preliminary AAA rating from S&amp;P on the back of Durst\u2019s financial strength and the tower\u2019s performance. Remaining capital will go toward tenant improvements, leasing costs and a $146 million equity payout to the landlord. The fresh financing replaced\na $900 million refinancing\nfrom JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo from 2019. The tower, formerly known as 4 Times Square, is 92 percent leased. TikTok is the anchor tenant and occupies 232,000 square feet.\nParamount payday | $900M | Midtown\n\nMorgan Stanley and Wells Fargo\nprovided a $900 million loan for Paramount Group\u2019s 45-story office tower at 1301 Sixth Avenue. The loan replaced a $710 million loan from Morgan Stanley that was set to mature in 2026. The refi came after law firm Piper Sandler signed a 140,000-square-foot lease and law firm Adler &amp; Stachenfeld took 40,000 square feet, bringing the building to 97 percent occupancy. The building will soon be owned by New York City-based Rithm Capital, which won a bidding war for Paramount after shareholders raised concerns over the real estate investment trust\u2019s performance and management.\nApollo landing | $785M | Midtown\nApollo Global Management\nprovided a $785 million loan to finance RXR\u2019s $1.08 billion purchase of 590 Madison Avenue. RXR bought the Plaza District office tower for $1.08 billion from the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio. Scott Rechler\u2019s firm partnered with Elliott Investment Management and Baupost Group on the deal. The final debt package is broken down into a $650 million senior loan, a $135 million mezzanine loan and about $60 million in future funding commitments for things like tenant improvements and leasing costs. Eastdil Secured\u2019s Grant Frankel arranged the debt.\nNaftali knockdown | $675M | Upper East Side\nJPMorgan Chase\nprovided a $675 million loan for Miki Naftali\u2019s purchase of the 33-story 800 Fifth Avenue rental building from Eliot Spitzer and the Winter Organization. Naftali agreed to buy the 208-unit building last March for more than $800 million, which works out to about $2,400 per square foot. He plans to tear down the existing building and replace it with a new tower. Newmark\u2019s Jordan Roeschlaub and Nick Scribani arranged the debt.\nCopper cash | $525M | Murray Hill\nArbor Realty Trust\nprovided a $525 million loan for the Copper Apartments, a pair of luxury apartment towers owned by Josh Gotlib and Meyer Orbach\u2019s GO Residential REIT.\u00a0 The fresh financing for the 761-unit property at 616-626 First Avenue in Murray Hill replaced a $611.5 million CMBS loan. Gotlib and Orbach bought the buildings in 2022 for $837 million.

You can see the top 10\u00a0 by clicking here.\nAthens, Georgia-based Landmark Properties partnered with investment management firm Stockbridge in late April to acquire the two buildings, Icon Plaza at 3584 South Figueroa Street, and West 27th Place, at 2700 South Figueroa Street, in a deal brokered by TSB Realty. The former, erected in 2012 with 57 units and 252 beds sold for $51.5 million, and the latter, built in 2010 with 161 units and 452 beds, went for $48.5 million.\n\u201cGiven that approximately 81 percent of USC students require off-campus options, Icon Plaza and West 27th Place are ideally situated to deliver vital, purpose-built student housing,\u201d JD Goering, senior vice president of acquisitions at Landmark, said in a news release about the deal. The two properties are within walking distance to USC\u2019s main academic and recreational buildings.\nLandmark committed to renovating common areas and amenities at the Icon Plaza. No major updates were planned for West 27th as it was recently renovated.\n\nIcon Plaza features fully furnished two- to five-bedroom units. The building has a swimming pool, rooftop lounge, clubhouse, fitness center and study rooms. Starbucks, Jersey Mike\u2019s, Movita, Juice Bar and Wingstop are the ground-floor tenants.\nWest 27th Place consists of studio, one-, two-, and four-bedroom units offering a modern furniture package. Amenities include a swimming pool, fitness center, clubhouse with social areas, and study rooms. Retail tenants on the ground floor include Five Guys, Thai by Trio and Factory Tea Bar.\nOne of the most active student housing developers in the country,\nLandmark is on a tear\n.\nAs of the end of April, the firm said it had over 50 student and multifamily projects under construction or near term start with an estimated value of over $10 billion.\nThat pipeline includes The Mark at Los Angeles, under construction near the UCLA campus, and The Standard at Los Angeles being built near the USC campus. The two projects will add more than 1,450 beds to the market.\n",

It then renovated and expanded the building into a two-story office and creative manufacturing hub, according to the Business Times\nIt\u2019s a notable upgrade in space for the four-year-old Astro Mechanica. Its current offices are a block away in a roughly 4,000-square-foot building at 19 Butte Place.\n\nVantage finished the renovation during the pandemic and 550 7th Street has remained vacant ever since. The property features manufacturing space on the ground floor and office space on its second and mezzanine levels. Over the spring and summer, an\nartificial intelligence\ncompany, a\nrobotics\ncompany, general technology companies and one tenant that needed space for three-dimensional printers for prototyping toured the property, according to the Business Times.\nAstro Mechanica is working to create a new jet engine that would enable commercial supersonic flights to return to the skies. The company was founded by CEO Ian Brooke in 2021 and raised a $27.1 million round of funding this spring, per the Business Times. Last month, the company secured an undisclosed investment from United Airlines\u2019 venture capital arm. United in particular has already committed to a forthcoming supersonic flight rebirth, pledging to buy 15 planes from Boom Supersonic with the hope of starting commercial supersonic flights by the end of the decade.\nThe $27.1 million raised will be used to build out Astro Mechanica\u2019s software team, further develop and test its jet engine prototype, and launch a team to start building airframes, Brooke\ntold\nTectonic in April. The funding will also enable Astro Mechanica to pursue government contracts. Its goal is to establish the first supersonic commercial flight at a price point similar to existing air travel within the next decade.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A casino is no longer in Manhattan\u2019s future.\nThe gaming proposal from Soloviev Group, which would have built a casino on a vacant lot near the United Nations building, was rejected this morning in a four-to-two vote before a community advisory committee.\nSoloviev\u2019s plan is the third to be rejected by a CAC over the course of one week. The result eliminates all proposals for a casino located in Manhattan. Five proposals remain, with three licenses available from the state.\nThe four members of the committee who voted against the proposal were Sandra McKee, appointed by State Senator Kristen Gonzalez; Reshma Patel, appointed by Assembly member Harvey Epstein; Celeste Royo, appointed by Borough President Mark Levine; and Jasmine Narula, appointed by Council member Keith Powers.\nThe two who voted for the proposal were Jennifer Sta. Ines, appointed by Mayor Eric Adams and Nichols Silbersack, appointed by Gov. Kathy Hochul.\n\nSoloviev\u2019s proposal, called \u201cFreedom Plaza,\u201d would have been an $11 billion development, the most expensive of all the plans. The partnership with the Mohegan Tribe and Banyan Group aimed to build a below-grade casino at 686 First Avenue, with 1,049 housing units and green space. It also offered equity options for city residents.\nThe Freedom Plaza proposal failed despite significant tailwinds in recent days. On Friday, Mayor Eric Adams released a report that showed the Soloviev plan would create more jobs than any other casino plan. And on Saturday, the partnership announced an amendment that all housing units would be permanently affordable, increasing the number of affordable units by 400.\nThe CACs, one for each proposal, are tasked with determining if there is public support for a casino proposal. Those that are approved at this stage will go before the state gaming commission.\nAfter three rejections over the last week, five proposals remain: Mets owner Steve Cohen\u2019s project at Citi Field, Thor Equities\u2019 proposed Coney Island development, one from Bally\u2019s in the Throgg\u2019s Neck area of the Bronx, Genting\u2019s proposed casino in Jamaica, Queens and a site in Yonkers from MGM.\nThe CACs must vote before Sept 30.",

Unit 5B hit the market earlier this month, roughly two years after the sellers bought it for $16 million. The apartment has four bedrooms and four bathrooms and also features a corner great room with views of the Hudson River.\nAmenities in the 46-unit building, developed by Related Companies, include a garage, fitness center, a lap pool and squash court.\nCortnee Glasser with Sotheby\u2019s International had the listing.\nThe Tribeca building has snagged a number of notable buyers since sponsor sales launched in 2016, including film producer and director Jack Heller, who in 2018 paid\n$19 million\nfor a 4,100-square-foot unit with a terrace.\n\nA $55 million penthouse at 70 Vestry was also at the center of a\ncontentious divorce\nbetween the CEO of the modeling agency Elite World Group, Julia Haart, and her estranged husband, Italian telecom mogul Silvio Scaglia. A judge sided with Haart, who also starred in the reality TV show \u201cMy Unorthodox Life,\u201d in divorce proceedings, awarding her the apartment earlier this year.\nThe second most expensive home to enter contract was a townhouse at 80 Horatio Street, with an asking price of $9 million. The West Village home, which is currently configured as multiple rental apartments, hit the market earlier this month for the first time in roughly 50 years.\nThe buyer signed the pending deal after a bidding war, and the final sale price will likely be between $10 million and $11 million, sources told Olshan. The 25-foot-wide home spans five stories and 6,100 square feet.\nBrown Harris Stevens\u2019 Amy Herman and Kyle Cooper had the listing.\nOf the 21 properties, 15 were condos, five were co-ops and one was a townhouse.\nThe homes\u2019 combined asking price was $144 million, for an average price of $6.9 million and a median of $6 million. The typical home spent more than a year and a half on the market and was discounted 7 percent from the original listing price.\n",

        "content": "After multiple delays, a task force entrusted with the fate of the Brooklyn Marine Terminal has voted to allow plans to build thousands of units of housing on the site to move forward.\nThe 28-member task force, chaired by Rep. Dan Goldman, on Monday advanced in a 17-to-eight vote the $3.5 billion plan to redevelop the 122-acre marine terminal, which runs from Cobble Hill to Red Hook. The latest plan calls for 6,000 apartments on the site, with 40 percent set aside as affordable. Roughly half of the site will include modernized piers along with a new marginal pier for smaller and mid-sized ships.\nThe plan also includes 275,000 square feet of light industrial space, an up to 400-key hotel and 28 acres of open space.\nMonday\u2019s vote simply means that plans for the terminal will move forward, with the environmental review and the general project plan process coming next. But the task force had the ability to kill the project before it even began the state\u2019s public review process \u2014\u00a0and its fate appeared precarious over the last few months.\nThe vote was\npostponed\nfive times, as the task force struggled to get enough yes votes to move the project forward. The proposal has also undergone multiple revisions. Initial plans called for up to 12,000 housing units, which were then pared down to 7,700 and then to 6,000.\nThe critical vote was delayed amid accusations that the city and state were trying to rush the plan forward. Some elected officials, including Council member Alexa Avil\u00e9s, a vice chair of the task force, and Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, worried that the plan would further diminish the city\u2019s industrial and manufacturing capabilities.\nIn a Brooklyn Eagle editorial she co-wrote with Eddie Bautista, Avil\u00e9s, executive director of the NYC Environmental Justice Alliance and a member of the task force, called the plan \u201chalf-baked,\u201d and raised doubts that the commitments made as part of the plan would be honored.\nBut last week, some of the task force\u2019s naysayers were swayed by a number of changes, including an increase in funds for housing and industrial space. The Economic Development Corporation, the agency leading this project, has pledged to create a $75 million fund to build or preserve housing off-site within Community Board 6, up from the original $50 million commitment.\nThe administration also added 50,000 square feet of light industrial space, bringing the project\u2019s total to 275,000 square feet, with a majority of that space dedicated to a single, mixed-use building planned for Pier 11.\nOther new investments include $3 million for capital improvements at public schools in areas near the terminal and $7 million for improvements at DiMattina Park, Van Voorhees Playground, Carroll Park and other parks in the area.\nThis fall, EDC will also release a request for expressions of interest, seeking proposals for different port configurations and additional maritime industrial activities at the port. The agency will also develop an alternative for a larger port that will be analyzed in the environmental review process.\nLast week, EDC credited Council member Shahana Hanif and Reynoso for helping to work out the changes, which ultimately paved the way for Monday\u2019s vote.\n\nAn ailing piece of infrastructure\nThe city took control of the terminal last year through a\nland swap\nwith the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which received Staten Island\u2019s Howland Hook Marine Terminal in the exchange.\nMuch was at stake for the administration, which is trying to make good on a bet that creating a modern port \u2014\u00a0while also adding thousands of units of housing \u2014 was better than continuing to subsidize the activities of a flailing terminal.\nDuring a tour of the site in June, EDC head Andrew Kimball described decades\u2019 worth of deferred basic maintenance at the terminal, piling up to hundreds of millions of dollars. Two of the piers were condemned roughly a year ago, and another two are about eight to 10 years from collapsing, he said at the time.\nThe port handles roughly 60,000 containers every year, or roughly 1.5 percent of the containers brought into New York Harbor. The terminal has also been used for non-maritime purposes, storing mountains of aggregate, junk cars and decades-old modular hotel units.\nInstead of replacing three of the long piers that jut out into the East River, the city wants to fill in the gaps between the aging piers to create a marginal pier deeper in the channel, allowing ships to sidle up sideways.\nThe administration saw the deal with the Port Authority as an opportunity to double down on moving goods by water \u2014\u00a0as a way to reduce trucks transporting perishable food items throughout the city, for instance \u2014\u00a0while also using a portion of the site for housing.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just eliminate this site completely as a maritime opportunity,\u201d Kimball said during the tour.\nPending approval by the state, developers of the residential sites will make payments in lieu of taxes, which will be invested into the terminal, rather than the city\u2019s general fund. The Economic Development Corporation expects to fund the affordable housing component with revenues from the overall development and \u201cadditional public grants.\u201d Officials have also pledged to invest $200 million in public housing complexes, Red Hook Houses East and Red Hook Houses West.\nKimball said that once the project is officially approved, a development corporation \u2014 whose members will be appointed by the governor, mayor and local representatives \u2014 will decide how to roll out the search for developers of the residential sites. He noted the \u201cstrong interest\u201d among the task force members to ensure that multiple developers are involved, unlike the nearby megadevelopment Pacific Park.\nThe state is still in the process of approving new development teams for the remaining housing at that project, which has been criticized for not spreading the risk of developing those sites among more developers.\n",

Holliday made his comments at a shareholder dinner at the Le Pavillon restaurant\ninside One Vanderbilt\n, arranged by Bank of Montreal analyst John Kim.\n\u201cHe said it\u2019s an iconic building and at the right price, SL Green would be interested,\u201d Kim told the outlet.\nSL Green did not return requests for comments from Crain\u2019s.\nCooper Union, which owns the Chrysler Building at 405 Lexington Avenue, tapped Savills to\nmarket the property\u2019s ground lease\nin the spring. The arts and engineering school owns the land beneath the building.\nWhile being a famed feature of the New York City skyline, the Chrysler Building has been a source of recent drama in the real estate industry.\nIn January, a\njudge terminated RFR\u2019s ground lease\n, evicting it from the property. That ruling came months after Aby Rosen\u2019s firm sued Cooper Union in September after the school moved to terminate the company\u2019s ground lease. Cooper Union claimed the company stopped paying rent in June and racked up arrears to the tune of $21 million.\n\nRosen\u2019s firm bought the ground lease\nof the office tower for $151 million in 2019, harboring plans to revamp the building. It invested $170 million in renovations during its brief time at the property.\nBut the cost of the lease payments proved problematic after the onset of the pandemic and the 2023 bankruptcy of RFR\u2019s partner at the property, Austria real estate investor Signa Holding.\nTenants include law firm Moses &amp; Singer, Creative Artists Agency and architect Ted Moudis. The vacancy rate in the building as of May was roughly 15 percent.\nLast week, a Community Advisory Committee\nrejected SL Green\u2019s proposal\nfor a Times Square casino, killing the project. After the vote, Holliday unloaded on committee members, calling the decision a \u201cdespicable display of cowardice, lack of leadership, lack of consideration for all the people who would benefit from this proposal.\u201d\nThe same day, Rithm Capital\nsigned a deal\nto acquire office landlord Paramount Group for $1.6 billion.

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s housing market could see a \u201cfeeding frenzy\u201d next year if mortgage rates continue to slide off the Fed\u2019s easing interest rates, but where rates and the market are going is uncertain.\nMortgage rates aren\u2019t directly affected by the Fed\u2019s interest rates. They track closely to the 10-year Treasury bond and usually move in anticipation of what the Fed will do. Rates have been falling fairly steadily all year, and they reached their lowest point this year before last week\u2019s rate cut, according to Freddie Mac.\nBrokers said they\u2019re hopeful mortgage rates below 6 percent could be on the horizon if the Fed cuts interest rates further this year as it indicated and keeps up an optimistic view of the economy.\nWhether the Fed\u2019s signal on interest rates will bring mortgage rates down further isn\u2019t clear yet. The 10-year Treasury yield and mortgage rates ticked up slightly in the days following the Fed\u2019s announcement, partially owing to lower jobless claims announced Thursday. But the 30-year mortgage rate is still on the lower end of the last three years, at 6.35 percent as of Friday, according to Mortgage News Daily.\n\u201cAll the conversation of where it\u2019s going, I don\u2019t think anybody knows where the rates are going to go,\u201d Dream Town CEO Yuval Degani said. \u201cIf you look at all the estimations of the last three years, the forecasts, they never happened.\u201d\n\nBut if lower mortgage rates do come, the early months of next year could be a \u201cfeeding frenzy,\u201d Fulton Grace Realty broker Patrick Shino said, as more buyers pour into the market and their buying power grows.\nChicago\u2019s housing market has been saddled by low inventory the last few years, driving prices up and creating competition for scarce listings. Homeowners locked into 2 to 3 percent rates aren\u2019t selling, and the buyer pool isn\u2019t drying up. Home prices have increased year-over-year each month for almost two years straight, and active listings have been trending downward since 2020, according to Redfin and the Federal Reserve.\nLower rates will help with the scarcity, unlocking some inventory as homeowners who have been holding out on moving put their houses on the market. Jenny Ames, a broker with Engel and V\u00f6lkers, said she thinks the market will start to normalize as people who have been wanting to move take advantage of the lower interest rates, freeing up homes for other buyers.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that prices are necessarily going to come down right away because we\u2019ve had this scarcity issue,\u201d Ames said. \u201cBut over time, if rates come down and stay down and the logjam breaks, then I think the pressure on inventory will start to ease and we\u2019ll start to see a more normal market.\u201d\nBut Shino said he doubts the added inventory will keep up with the demand that will grow alongside it. First-time buyers who missed out on interest rates below 3 percent will be eager to lock in properties if rates dip below 6 percent.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to want to miss out on it again, and I think you\u2019re going to have far more buyers flooding into the market,\u201d Shino said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way there\u2019s going to be enough inventory to satiate that buyer demand.\u201d",
