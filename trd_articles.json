        "content": "It\u2019s enough to make any real estate hater burn: Cayre Equities just sold 254 West 35th Street for 62 percent more than they had paid just 14 months before, as my colleague Liz Cryan\nreported\n.\nThe key to the $10 million increase was that between the purchase and the sale, the city\nrezoned Midtown South\n, including Cayre\u2019s Garment District building.\nWhat should we make of this?\nOne thing that real estate\u2019s critics dislike about rezoning is that it adds value to properties. It creates wealth out of thin air for whomever was lucky or smart enough to own a rezoned parcel at the time.\nCritics call buyers of land that might be rezoned \u201cspeculators,\u201d a derogatory term that suggests investors are trying to make money without doing any real work. They also claim property speculation makes the city more expensive.\nThis is stupid on several levels.\nFirst, rezoning is necessary to make the best use of land when circumstances change, as they have in the Garment District. Midtown West is now much more valuable to society as residential or office space than as manufacturing.\nCity politicians resisted rezoning it for decades in a misguided attempt to save textile jobs, but nearly all of those jobs disappeared or moved elsewhere anyway. The government was also slow to rezone manufacturing districts in Long Island City, Gowanus, Inwood and Red Hook.\nSecond, \u201cspeculators\u201d play a useful role in the market by buying properties that someone wants to sell. Markets need liquidity. If Mrs. Jones wants to cash out a longtime family property and retire to Arizona, she needs buyers. To her, they are not speculators, but investors who make her golden years truly golden. (Cayre bought 254 West 35th from\nGonca Chelsea\u2019s LLC\n.)\nThird, every time a property is sold, the city, state and Metropolitan Transportation Authority collect transfer taxes. Critics who believe sales and property upgrades make the city more expensive should consider how much higher their subway fare would be, or if garbage pickup would be free, if not for transfer taxes.\nState and city transfer taxes on sales of $25 million or more range from 1.4 percent to\nalmost 6 percent\n. The Cayre family\u2019s sale of 254 West 35th generated\n$773,665 in transfer taxes\n\u2014 3 percent of the sale. Its purchase in 2024 produced\n$528,912\nin transfer taxes.\nIf you believe the family did nothing to make millions of dollars on its flip, ask yourself what the government did to reap $1.3 million.\nIt doesn\u2019t take zero work to buy and sell a property. The buyer is putting money at risk rather than, say, buying a Treasury note paying a guaranteed 4 percent. Acquiring investment properties involves a lot of due diligence, networking and fundraising from investors, among other things. It takes a lot more time than buying an index fund with a few mouse clicks.\nThe Cayres made a profit, but it could also be called earnings. It\u2019s not passive income. It\u2019s money derived from work.\n",

        "content": "Venice\u2019s latest affordable housing project has gotten a funding boost from Los Angeles County, much to the chagrin of the city of Los Angeles that has spent more than $1 million in legal fees fighting its development.\nThe Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors\napproved nearly $44 million\nin loans\nfor affordable housing\ndevelopments across the county, including $3 million for Hollywood Community Housing and Venice Community Housing\u2019s Venice Dell project, Palisades News reported. The $3 million injection is in addition to the more than\n$42.5 million\nthat the California Department of Housing and Community Development committed to the development.\nWhen complete, Venice Dell will consist of low-rise buildings containing 120 apartments and ground-floor retail on a 2.7-acre parking lot at Venice Boulevard and Pacific Avenue. Supervisor Lindsey Horvath, whose district includes the Venice Dell site, announced the funding allocation last week. The Los Angeles City Council first approved the project in 2021, and in 2024, the\nCalifornia Coastal Commission\ngranted a coastal development permit after years of review and legal challenges given its proximity to the beach.\nDespite the approvals, including from the City Council itself, the project still hasn\u2019t gotten off the ground. The city has spent more than $1 million on outside legal counsel fees related to the project; recent allocations include $650,000 through March. The office of city attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto has continued to seek additional funding for litigation, including a $760,000 request at the top of this year.\nTraci Park, who represents the area on the City Council, has derided the Venice Dell project over concerns about parking loss, coastal access and overall cost. Last October, the City Council began looking into converting the Los Angeles Department of Transportation-owned parking lot at the site into a mobility hub while studying relocating Venice Dell to another nearby parcel.\nHorvath, meanwhile, has criticized the city\u2019s legal spending, including the $650,000 set aside for outside counsel fees through March. \u201cThe city has now spent over $1 million fighting\naffordable housing\nprojects,\u201d Horvath said, per Palisades News. \u201cWhile they\u2019re fighting housing, we\u2019re funding it.\u201d The city\u2019s total outside counsel fees related to such projects including Venice Dell exceed $2.5 million, the supervisor said. \u201cIt is ridiculous to spend taxpayer dollars to oppose a project that has been approved at every level of government, even by the Coastal Commission,\u201d Horvath said. \u201cIt is time for the city to get out of its own way and allow Venice Dell to move forward.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The Partnership for New York City\u2019s new CEO says he relates to Mayor Zohran Mamdani.\nLike Mamdani, Steve Fulop became a mayor in his 30s.\n\u201cI was elected as a mayor at 35 years old, trying to balance a political base that was pushing me to do certain things versus what I thought was in the best interest of Jersey City,\u201d Fulop said. \u201cI think he has to ultimately experience some of the give and take and grow.\u201d\nFulop was mayor of Jersey City for three terms, and unsuccessfully ran for New Jersey governor last year. The view from his office on the fifth floor of One Battery Park Plaza provides a reminder of his previous gig \u2014 Jersey City\u2019s skyline \u2014\u00a0as he embarks on his new role.\nAs head of the Partnership, he represents more than 300 businesses in the city. Members include some of the most prominent builders and owners in the city, such as Vornado Realty Trust, SL Green Realty, Tishman Speyer, Related Companies and Blackstone. To what extent Fulop will serve as a go-between for executives of such firms and the new mayor remains to be seen.\nDuring a recent interview, I asked Fulop about his relationship with Mamdani and what real estate issues are top of mind as he takes the helm at the Partnership. On the latter, he and the Partnership\u2019s board will be setting the organization\u2019s agenda this month. However, priorities include policies that make it easier for developers to build housing, property tax reform and public safety. He\u2019s not sure how vocal the Partnership will be on the mayor\u2019s pledge to freeze rents for stabilized apartments. It depends on how that promise plays out.\nYou said you plan to push a pro-growth, housing agenda. Have you spoken with Mayor Zohran Mamdani about this?\nThe housing conversation was more of a very\nsmall group of real estate executives\n. He has a lot of smart questions. He\u2019s very curious, and I think he\u2019s very committed to being an effective mayor. There\u2019s going to be a learning curve in the transition from being on [the] activist side to more of an elected official. He was [a state] Assembly person, but now he\u2019s a very prominent elected official. He has a base in that DSA that\u2019s very complicated, and I think it\u2019s not always in line with the realities of the world of being an effective executive, and I think that he\u2019s going to have to navigate that a little bit, and our role is to be helpful where he wants it.\nDoes that include conversations about the mayor\u2019s call to increase taxes?\nThe CEOs in the Partnership are responsible for billions upon billions of dollars in budgets, hundreds of thousands of employees. We want to be helpful. The public sector is most effective when they think about strategic partnerships with the private sector. It\u2019s on him whether he wants to be a part of that. I recognize that his base may not always appreciate that, but I think that part of the responsibility of being an effective mayor is recognizing that your base isn\u2019t always correct.\nWhat have you heard from your members?\nThere\u2019s a lot of nervousness. I think that nobody knows what a socialist mayor looks like. You haven\u2019t seen a socialist executive in any prominent role in decades. All of the DSA or socialist people that have been elected, up until now, are generally on the legislative side. That\u2019s a different type of person that can throw bombs from the outside with less accountability. It\u2019s a person that\u2019s not directly responsible for budgets. I think CEOs in the partnership are hopeful that things work out well, [but there\u2019s] a lot of anxiety about what this will ultimately be in six months, in a year.\nHave you heard from any developers in Jersey City since the new mayor took over?\nThey miss me. I mean, look, there\u2019s a lot of things that we started that are in queue. The hope is that the mayor continues the progress there. I think people there are nervous too, because he\u2019s made the real estate community out to be the villain. His campaign was about that, and I would hope that he would moderate now that he\u2019s won an election, but we\u2019ll see.\n[After this interview, Mayor James Solomon\nblamed\nFulop for leaving Jersey City with a $250 million budget deficit, saying his predecessor \u201csystematically prioritized short-term political gain over the City\u2019s long-term fiscal health.\u201d In a statement, Fulop disputed the claim and dismissed it as \u201cpolitical theater.\u201d]\nDo you think you\u2019ll go back into the public sector?\nNo, I think that in many ways, this job is a capstone, dream job. It has all the benefits [of] public service, without any of the downside. You\u2019re in a very polarized environment for elected officials. When you think about the benefits versus the cost to your personal life and your family, I don\u2019t know if the trade-off is worth it in today\u2019s world.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: Who will run for Sen. Mike Gianaris\u2019 seat? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The city\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection\nposted on social media\nthat water usage dropped across the five boroughs during the Super Bowl\u2019s halftime show on Sunday. During the 15 minutes after the show concluded, the city saw a spike equivalent to 761,719 toilets flushing across the city.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 Department of Social Services Commissioner Molly Wasow Park, who was appointed by former Mayor Eric Adams in 2023, resigned on Monday,\nGothamist reports\n. Park told the news site that the uncertainty around whether the Mamdani administration would keep her on \u201chas been really taxing on the agency, on me and my family.\u201d She has not yet chosen when her last day on the job will be. Her resignation comes as the city is grappling with a rising number of deaths due to extremely cold temperatures. Since Jan. 24, 18 people have been found dead outside.\n\u2014 The state chapter of the Working Families Party has chosen not to choose. The party has opted to endorse a placeholder candidate for governor rather than back Gov. Kathy Hochul or Antonio Delgado in the primary,\nCity &amp; State reports\n. The placeholder will be replaced by whoever wins the Democratic nomination.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$20.8 million\nfor a penthouse at 201 East 74th Street. The Lenox Hill condominium unit is 5,300 square feet of new construction.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s\nBarbara Russo, Christopher Salierno, Elena Sarkissian and MariaElena Scotto have the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$31.6 million\nfor 1220 Broadway. The NoMad commercial building has 58 units and is 75,500 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $29.8 million for a penthouse at 383 West Broadway. The Soho co-op unit is 7,500 square feet.\nReserve Partners\u2019\nTrish Riedel and Jonathan Isaacs have the listing.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "A pair of developers scored a $60 million loan to build a condo building in Miami, as construction financing flows for South Florida residential projects amid higher interest rates.\nAscendra Capital and BAM Development scored the loan for their planned eight-story, 117-unit Seventeen Gables Condominium at 1715 Southwest 27th Avenue/Douglas Road, according to the lender\u2019s news release. Dwight Mortgage Trust provided the debt.\nIsaac Filler and Steve Edelstein were part of the Filler Capital team that represented the borrowers. David Scheer and Alex Izso of Dwight Mortgage originated the loan.\nConstruction is expected to start immediately, with completion slated for next year, the release says. The building will consist of one- to three-bedroom condo units, 178 parking spaces and 2,000 square feet of ground-floor retail.\nSales are expected to commence once construction commences, with asking prices starting under $700,000, according to the release. Tensie Forry of Cervera Real Estate is leading sales.\nAn entity led by Mayer Berkovits of BAM paid $14.3 million for the 0.9-acre development site in 2023, assuming the seller\u2019s $4 million loan on the property and bumping it to $8.5 million, with S III Capital Partners as the lender, records show. That debt was reassigned to S III SB Real Estate Credit A, with Dwight Mortgage assuming the debt this month and bumping it up to $60 million, according to records.\nDwight Mortgage Trust is a real estate investment trust and affiliate of New York-based Dwight Capital.\nThe planned Seventeen Gables Condominium marks a change of plans for the site. BAM had planned an\neight-story, 120-unit\napartment building, Mayer Berkovits told\nThe Real Deal\nat the time of its site purchase.\nAscendra Capital is led by David Steinberg.\nDevelopers have jumped on the area, which is close to Coral Gables, with plans for high-end condos.\nLast month, Allen Morris Company secured a\n$132.5 million\nconstruction loan for its long-planned 11-story, 58-unit Ponce Park condo development at 3000 Ponce de Leon Boulevard in Coral Gables. Raimundo Onetto\u2019s Alta Developers is developing the 174-unit Cassia \u2013 The Residences at Coral Gables in Coral Gables at 4011 Salzedo Street, scoring a\n$94.2 million\nconstruction loan in May.\nLast year, Constellation Group and Boschetti Group switched their planned apartment project in Coral Gables to condos.

        "content": "David MacNeil, the founder of WeatherTech, dropped $68.3 million on a third oceanfront estate in Manalapan.\nIt brings his total spend on property in the small coastal enclave to $162.3 million. Records show MacNeil bought the mansion at 1940 South Ocean Boulevard from Frank and Dolores Mennella.\nPhilip Lyle Smith and Carla Ferreira-Smith with Luxury Resort Portfolio had the listing, and Margit Brandt with Premier Estate Properties brought the buyer.\nMacNeil has a net worth of $4 billion, according to Forbes. In January, President Donald Trump tapped him to serve on the Federal Trade Commission, and his appointment is awaiting confirmation. He also owns a car collection worth $400 million, Forbes\nreported\n.\nMacNeil has been on a South Florida real estate spending spree in recent years. Last year, he bought the 1.6-acre estate at 1140 South Ocean Boulevard for\n$55.5 million\n. It is adjacent to the 2-acre compound at 1120 South Ocean Boulevard he bought for\n$38.5 million\nin 2024.\nMacNeil also owns a half-acre waterfront compound in Fort Lauderdale which he bought for $5.5 million in 2013, records show. It is on the market asking $40 million, Zillow shows.\nThe Mennellases bought the 1.9-acre ocean-to-Intracoastal estate at 1940 South Ocean Boulevard for $7.5 million in 2018. They built the 10,500-square-foot mansion in 2022, and it has six bedrooms, nine bathrooms, four half-bathrooms, a gym, spa facilities, a theater, game room, craft room, two bowling alleys, a dock and a\ntunnel to the beach\n.\nThey listed it for\n$84.9 million\nin May, shortly after spending\na record $48 million\non a mansion in Jupiter\u2019s Bear\u2019s Club. In 2023, they sold another oceanfront Manalapan mansion for\n$48.4 million\n.\nThe Mennellases\u2019 and MacNeils\u2019 recent real estate activity in Manalapan is a window into the rapid ascension of the small town amongst South Florida\u2019s top luxury markets.\nAgents say buyers see Manalapan as an appealing alternative to nearby Palm Beach\n. Manalapan has an abundance of oceanfront estates that also have dockage on the Intracoastal Waterway, and at lower prices than in Palm Beach.\nBillionaire Randal Kirk\nrecently found a buyer for his oceanfront Manalapan mansion after dropping the price from $134 million to $90 million.",

        "content": "Data centers may no longer be coming to a town near New Yorkers if a pair of state legislators get their way.\nState Sen. Liz Krueger and Assembly member Anna Kelles introduced a bill that would create a three-year moratorium on data center development in the state, Wired\nreported\n. It\u2019s one of a half-dozen states to recently announce a measure to combat the proliferation of the industrial real estate sector.\n\u201cDemocrats and Republicans are moving forward with exactly these kinds of moratoriums,\u201d Krueger said in a press conference. \u201cNew York should be in the front of the line to get this done.\u201d\nThe moratorium would see the cessation of permits issued for data center projects while the Department of Environmental Conservation and the Public Service Commission work on reports assessing data center impacts and suggesting regulations.\nData center development has become a significant boon for the real estate industry, as big technology players increasingly seek out more computing power, particularly for artificial intelligence use. FMI Corporation\nrecently forecasted\na 23 percent uptick in data\u2011center construction spending this year, pushing the sector to more than 6 percent of all nonresidential building activity \u2014 up sharply from 2 percent in 2023.\nBut the developments are also fraught with controversy, especially environmental concerns and worries about impact on the grid.\nNew York is home to more than 130 data centers. Several projects are in the works, including a 450-megawatt development in Ithaca. There\u2019s at least 10 gigawatts of electricity demand waiting to be connected to the grid.\nGov. Kathy Hochul recently launched an initiative to insulate ratepayers from high energy costs, demanding data center developers \u201cpay their fair share.\u201d\nAmong those calling for a national moratorium on such projects is Sen. Bernie Sanders. Food and Water Watch also gathered hundreds of environmental groups to press for a national moratorium.\nOther states where\ndata center moratoriums\nare under consideration include Georgia, Maryland, Oklahoma, Vermont and Virginia; the latter is one of the biggest hubs of data centers in the country.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Sales will resume at the West Hollywood condominium complex once known as the\nPendry Residences\n.\nThe 40-unit property at 8420 Sunset Boulevard finished the last of the paperwork with the California Department of Real Estate for its rebrand to the Sun Rose Residences once new ownership took it over less than two years ago.\nAfter hitting the pause button on sales mid-2025 for the property to prepare for the rebrand, the final dozen units at the Sun Rose are set to hit the market on Feb. 20 for the Sunset Strip development that saw\nrecords\nset under its former name.\nThat included the\n$14 million purchase\nin 2023 of Terrace Estate Penthouse 902. The 3,500-square-foot unit sold for $4,005 per square foot to mark the priciest condo trade in Los Angeles County that year.\n\u201cThe current ownership had a clear vision of what they wanted the property to be,\u201d said Mike Leipart, co-founder and managing principal of Redeavor, the firm handling sales for the condos. \u201cMaking this change to Sun Rose, changing the programming and physical changes we\u2019ve made in the interim, we clearly believe that it\u2019s going to be a real shot in the arm for these units.\u201d\nThe former Pendry Residences, which were attached to a 149-key hotel, was constructed by AECOM Capital and Combined Properties for more than $500 million in 2021. The two struggled to pay off the\ndebt tied to the property\nas reported by\nThe Real Deal\nin 2024, paving the way for\nMonarch Alternative Capital\nto take a stake in the limited liability company controlling the property. Monarch held a $165 million mezzanine loan on the former Pendry.\nSince the ownership change, furnishings along with events and recreational programming have been revitalized to fit what Leipart called the Sun Rose\u2019s \u201clifestyle destination.\u201d\nAs a result, Leipart expects the rest of the property\u2019s condos to be sold by year\u2019s end.\nThe remaining units are priced from $4.3 million to $8 million and start at 3,010 square feet of interior space and go up to 4,656 square feet. The units\u2019 exterior spaces range from 1,086 square feet to 2,732 square feet.\nRedeavor is handling sales, picking up from when The Agency Development Group had previously been marketing the property. The same individuals at The Agency that handled sales for what was then the Pendry were also behind last year\u2019s\nlaunch of Redeavor\n.\nThe firm was started by a consortium of heavyweights in new development. That included Leipart, who founded The Agency Development Group; Andrew Wachtfogel, the co-founder and former president of new development at Official; Shane Farkas, former COO and CTO at The Agency; and Wade Hundley,\nFormida Capital\nCEO and former ST Residential CEO.\n",

        "content": "Peter Palandjian paired with David Carlins\u2019 development giant Magellan to snag the biggest multifamily prize in Chicago so far this year.\nA joint venture of Boston-based investment firm Intercontinental Real Estate, whose CEO is Palandjian, and Chicago-based Magellan paid $126 million late last month for the 42-story, 322-unit apartment tower at\n73 East Lake Street\nin the Loop area, public records show. The seller was Tony Rossi and Tom Moran\u2019s Chicago-based firm, M&amp;R Development, which completed the building in 2014 in partnership with UBS Realty Investment.\nAt roughly $380,000 per unit, the acquisition sets a new high-water mark for 2026. The transaction narrowly bested the year\u2019s previous top trade: the $110 million sale of an apartment complex in Chicago\u2019s southwest suburbs that closed in recent weeks.\nThe Chicago sale also marks the city\u2019s largest in terms of total price since\nAMLI Residential\u2019s $134 million purchase\nof the 275-unit Milieu apartment tower in the West Loop late last year. It\u2019s well shy of\n2025\u2019s priciest multifamily sale of $175 million\nfor the 398-unit North Water Apartments in November, which marked the biggest deal in the sector since 2023.\nIntercontinental\u2019s purchase marks a significant institutional return for the firm, which has been largely quiet in downtown Chicago since buying the office redevelopment at\n811 West Fulton Market\nfrom Shapack Partners and Alec Litowitz for $50.3 million in 2019, a record price per square foot for the city\u2019s office market at the time.\nIntercontinental, Magellan and seller M&amp;R didn\u2019t immediately return requests for comment Tuesday.\nFor M&amp;R Development, the sale represents an exit from a property it held for over a decade in tandem with UBS, which bankrolled the cost of construction. UBS provided a nearly $76 million mortgage for the property\u2019s construction in 2012. Details on the property\u2019s financing since then aren\u2019t clear from public records.\nThe sellers originally explored the market with a listing in 2024, but the apartment building never sold. They re-listed the tower with a CBRE team of John Jaeger, Justin Puppi and Jason Zyck in 2025, betting on Chicago\u2019s robust rent growth and a thinning development pipeline. Peter Marino of CBRE arranged financing for Intercontinental and Magellan\u2019s transaction, though further details of the loan weren\u2019t publicly available Tuesday.\nM&amp;R\u2019s principals are veterans of Chicago\u2019s multifamily market, with Rossi serving as president of RMK Management, a property manager with a portfolio of thousands of apartments it operates for landlords in Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota. M&amp;R also built the Addison &amp; Clark apartment and retail complex across the street from Wrigley Field on the city\u2019s North Side. Yet, the firm\u2019s partnership with\nUBS on that development lost most of its equity in a $100 million sale\nin 2023.\nThe Lake Street tower, just west of Millennium Park, is known for its high-end finishes and amenities. The building features an indoor pool, a two-story fitness center and the \u201cClub 73\u201d sky lounge on the 42nd floor. Its mix of convertible, one-, and two-bedroom units were 94 percent leased at the time it hit the market.\nThe investment comes as Chicago\u2019s apartment market cements its status as a national leader. While Sun Belt metros are currently drowning in a glut of new supply, Chicago\u2019s development pipeline has effectively run dry. Construction starts across the metro have plummeted to their\nlowest levels since 2012\n, with fewer than 4,000 units projected for completion this year, according to Marcus &amp; Millichap.\n\u201dOver the next 12 -24 months, we expect the absolute number of vacant units downtown to be at the lowest levels in over a decade, in spite of the total number of units having virtually doubled since 2015,\u201d Chicago-based research firm Integra Realty Resources said in its annual report last month. \u201cRents are poised to spike given nominal new supply.\u201d\nThis supply-side drought has given existing premium buildings like the one at 73 East Lake Street a near-monopoly on high-end demand. With so little new product slated to hit the market in the coming years, stabilized Class A towers are seeing outsized rent appreciation, while competitors in overbuilt markets elsewhere are forced into concession wars \u2014 such as offering several months of free rent to new tenants \u2014 to keep units filled. As the largest trade of 2026, the $126 million deal is a flashing signal that institutional giants are finally ready to bet big on the Windy City\u2019s scarcity play.\n",

The proposal is sponsored in part by the\nCity of Santa Monica\n.\nAB 1740 would carve out a new category of \u201curban multimodal communities\u201d where local governments, not the commission, would have primary authority in dictating development, according to the bill. Zbur argues that the system, while essential for preserving sensitive resources, has created bottlenecks in areas where projects pose little environmental risk and are essential to housing production goals.\n\u201cThe California Coastal Act is one of our state\u2019s most important environmental laws, and is critical to protecting coastal access and our treasured coastal resources,\u201d Zbur said. \u201cHowever, in urbanized communities with robust public transit, current Coastal Commission standards must be modernized to achieve the important goals of the Coastal Act.\u201d\nUnder AB 1740, qualifying cities could approve housing projects without Coastal Commission permits if the developments are located in areas already zoned for multifamily use and are not within 300 feet of beaches, wetlands or environmentally sensitive habitat areas.\nMixed-income\nprojects \u2014 defined as those dedicating at least 7 percent of units to extremely low-income residents, 10 percent to very low-income households or 13 percent to lower-income residents \u2014 would be exempt from commission review when located in multifamily-designated areas. Dense developments with 10 or fewer units on sites smaller than 1 acre would also qualify if developed at a minimum density of 10 units per acre.\nIn qualifying cities, local governments could also add bike lanes, bus lanes and other multimodal transportation improvements without California Coastal Commission approval. AB 1740 would allow changes to roadways, including removal or relocation of on-street parking to make space for\nbicycle\ninfrastructure. The bill would also allow for the installation of accessible walkways, pay stations, signage and electric vehicle chargers in public facilities without permit approval.\nState lawmakers will consider AB 1740 in the policy committee later in this legislative session.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Tom Souleles, a longtime dealmaker at Madison Dearborn Partners, didn\u2019t linger on the market when it came time to sell his Lincoln Park home.\nSouleles, vice chairman of the Chicago-based private equity firm, and his wife, Cia Souleles, sold their mansion at\n1964 North Burling Street\nfor the full $6.5 million asking price, closing Friday after just a week on the market last fall. The deal stands as the Chicago area\u2019s highest-priced home sale of the still-young year, according to Crain\u2019s which first\nreported\nthe sale.\nThe sale price for the five bedroom house equates to $956 per square foot. The couple bought the 6,800-square-foot house in 2002 after it was restored by developer\nFred Latsko\n, though the sale price wasn\u2019t disclosed in public records. They later acquired the adjacent lot, creating a 50-by-123-foot parcel that gives the home a lawn, patio, rooftop decks and room to entertain \u2014 nearly the size of a standard double lot.\nThe couple listed the property Sept. 8 and had it under contract by Sept. 15, a brisk timeline even by Lincoln Park standards. Souleles did not respond to a request for comment by the publication, nor did listing agents Colette Cachey Smithburg and Joelle Cachey Hayes of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate. The buyers, who are not yet identified in public records, were represented by Keith Brand of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Chicago.\nOnly one other Chicago home has traded above $5 million this year, a\nGold Coast\nmansion that sold for $5.1 million in January. Three additional sales have cleared $4 million, in Lincoln Park, Bannockburn and Burr Ridge.\nBuilt in 1883, the\nItalianate\nhome features a carved limestone facade and bracketed cornice typical of late 19th century Chicago homes. The interior blends restored or recreated vintage details with modern updates: a stone fireplace mantel, curved stair railings, herringbone wood floors and high ceilings with crown moldings, according to the publication. A penthouse-level entertaining space opens onto a rooftop deck, designed to stay visually discreet from the street, with additional outdoor space atop the garage and along the side yard.\nSouleles joined Madison Dearborn in 1995 and rose through the ranks, as the firm became one of the country\u2019s most influential private equity players. He and Tim Sullivan were named co-CEOs in 2023 before Souleles moved into the vice chairman role.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

GI Partners bought the structures at 2805 and 2855 Bowers Avenue and 2710 Walsh Avenue in 2021 for $79 million.\nCoreSite\npaid 26.6 percent more for the buildings than\nGI Partners\ndid, signaling that buildings with the potential for data center development could fetch higher prices despite a weakened overall Bay Area office market.\nWhen GI Partners owned the buildings, the firm looked to develop a 244,100-square-foot data center at 2805 Bowers Avenue by demolishing the existing building on the site. The City of Santa Clara approved the proposal in 2024. GI\u2019s plans for the other sites were not clear.\nCoreSite has not disclosed plans for the three buildings, including whether it hopes to follow through with GI Partners\u2019 proposal or convert the existing structures into data centers.\nData centers in Santa Clara County have been attracting investor interest as\nartificial intelligence increases its foothold\nin the Bay Area and beyond.\nIn November, Brookfield subsidiary Centersquare\nbought two adjacent data centers\nin Santa Clara from Menlo Equities for $97 million in cash, one at 4650 Old Ironsides Drive for $55 million and the other at 4700 Old Ironsides Drive for $42 million.\nA month prior, a Goodman Group affiliate\npurchased a site in north San Jose\nthat has been proposed for a data center. The 46.8 acres at 350 and 370 West Trimble Road are largely vacant.\nPower delivery is also an issue for these facilities. Data center developers Digital Realty Trust and Stack Infrastructure each built data centers in Santa Clara, though they\nmight not get full power\nuntil 2028 as city-owned utility Silicon Valley Power doesn\u2019t yet have the capacity to deliver enough electricity needed to fuel the power-hungry facilities.\nThe city of Santa Clara has nearly 60 active or under-construction data centers, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Citadel\u2019s Ken Griffin decided to take a 60 percent stake in the joint venture that will transform 350 Park Avenue.\nVornado Realty Trust\u2019s Michael Franco on Tuesday said that Griffin wanted to accelerate the deal timeline, which originally gave him until June 2030 to either take a 60 percent stake or purchase the site for $1.4 billion, meaning that Vornado and Rudin Management would not take part in the development.\nGriffin chose the former in December, and thanks to a few other amendments to a 2022 agreement, Vornado and Rudin will be able to acquire an interest between 23 percent and 40 percent in the joint venture by July (with Vornado\u2019s stake ranging between 21 and 36 percent). The previous terms called for Vornado to take a 36 percent interest, and Rudin 4 percent. Demolition for the project is slated to start in April to make way for a new 2 million-square-foot office tower.\n\u201cWe intend to be part of this project,\u201d Franco said during Vornado\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call on Tuesday.\nVornado executives also indicated that Citadel, the tower\u2019s anchor tenant, may take more space than the previously announced 850,000 square feet.\n\u201cThe Citadel team is still making up their mind as to what exactly their requirements are,\u201d Vornado CEO Steve Roth said in response to an analyst\u2019s question. Franco added that the company is seeing interest from companies with leases expected to expire between 2031 and\u00a0 2033 who are looking for as little as 50,000 square feet.\nThe partners filed\npermit applications\nfor the project late last year, after the City Council approved\nrezoning\nthe site.\nVornado executives also provided an update on other redevelopment projects. Last month, the real estate investment trust acquired 3 East 54th Street for\n$141 million\n, with plans to demolish the existing office building on the site. Roth said the REIT is considering options for the site, but noted that \u201cthe location is excellent for hotel, office and residential uses.\u201d Roth repeatedly said he is \u201cin love\u201d with 623 Fifth Avenue, an\noffice building\nit bought for $218 million last year. The company plans to reposition the building as the \u201c220 Central Park South of boutique office\u201d by the end of 2027.\nFunds from operations during the fourth quarter were $110.9 million, or 55 cents per share, compared to $122.2 million, or 61 cents per share, during the same period in 2024. For the year, FFO was $465 million, or $2.32 per share, up from 2024\u2019s $447 million, or $2.26 per share.\nRoth acknowledged that the REIT\u2019s stock price has been struggling, but said \u201cthere is a huge disconnect between our stock price and the value of our assets.\u201d One year ago, to the day, Vornado\u2019s stock price was about $42 per share, but it hasn\u2019t reached above $40 since October, and as of noon on Tuesday, was just below $32.\nThe REIT\u2019s board authorized a stock buyback in 2023 and repurchased nearly 1.5 million common shares in 2025 for $50.9 million, at an average price of $34.9 per share.\n\u201cI am certainly aware of the recent decline in our stock and, in fact, the decline in all real estate stocks,\u201d Roth said. \u201cIn our case, the decline was in the face of the best fundamentals in Manhattan in the last 20 years. While this most likely represents a great buying opportunity, we will proceed with care, looking over our shoulder.\u201d\nHe said if the disconnect continues, Vornado will \u201cbecome more aggressive.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Global law firm Linklaters is bulking up in Midtown.\nThe London-based firm is adding 48,000 square feet at Vornado Realty Trust\u2019s\n1290 Sixth Avenue\n,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned. Linklaters signed a 10-year lease for a portion of the building\u2019s 11th floor, bringing its total footprint at the tower to more than 150,000 square feet. The new lease is coterminous with the firm\u2019s existing deal at the property. The asking rent was $100 per square foot.\nJLL\u2019s Lisa Kiell represented Linklaters in the transaction, while Vornado was represented in-house by Edward Riguardi and Ryan Levy.\nLinklaters, which has offices across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Asia, is the latest tenant to bet on Midtown\u2019s flight-to-quality trend, which has helped drive leasing momentum to a six-year high. The firm has been expanding in New York and Washington, D.C. In October, it added 6,500 square feet on the 34th floor of 1290 Sixth.\nThe expansion comes after Vornado completed a major renovation at the 43-story Sixth Avenue tower, which was built in 1963. Upgrades include a revamped lobby, a new curtain wall and the addition of wellness-focused amenities aimed at keeping the building competitive with newer office developments.\nInvestment firm\nNeuberger Berman\nremains the building\u2019s anchor tenant, occupying roughly 400,000 square feet under a lease signed in 2015.\nThe ownership structure of 1290 Sixth Avenue is also notable. The Trump Organization owns a 30 percent stake in the property through a partnership agreement that restricts a sale until 2044. The building is among the assets in President Donald Trump\u2019s portfolio that could be affected by\na New York judge\u2019s ruling\ntied to allegations that Trump inflated his company\u2019s property values for financial gain.\nLinklaters\u2019 deal marks the latest lease signed at the building this year, following Oaktree Capital Management\u2019s 79,000-square-foot deal in January for the entire 12th floor.\nVornado and Linklaters declined to comment.\n",

        "content": "Kilroy Realty continued its portfolio modification at the end of 2025.\nThe Los Angeles-based real estate investment trust entered into an agreement to offload a three-building, roughly 430,000-square-foot office campus in San Diego\u2019s I-15 Corridor for $124.5 million. That deal closed last month and amounts to about $290 per square foot. The three properties at 13480, 13500 and 13520 Evening Creek Drive North were 57,100 and 74 percent occupied, respectively, per the company\u2019s latest annual filing. Kilroy will continue to dispose of millions of dollars worth of non-core real estate, the company said on Tuesday\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call.\nLed by\nAngela Aman\n, Kilroy purchased a four-building, 230,000-square-foot life sciences campus in San Diego for $192 million in Torrey Pines, a neighborhood between La Jolla, a life sciences hub, and Del Mar. The deal equated to $835 per square foot. Three of the four properties are 100 percent occupied, and one is 28 percent filled, per a financial filing. Aman called it a \u201cgenerational opportunity,\u201d on the earnings call, and said it strengthened the company\u2019s San Diego presence.\nThe moves echo earlier decisions to dump less occupied offices in less desirable spots such as\n501 Santa Monica\nor\nSunset Media Center\nin the heart of Hollywood \u2014 and purchase\nMaple Plaza\n, a campus in Beverly Hills, for $205 million or about $700 a foot. The Beverly Hills property continues to attract new and renewal leases, the company said.\nThe company\u2019s portfolio was about 82 occupied at year end, and Kilroy signed more than 2 million square feet of leases in 2025, its highest annual leasing volume since before the pandemic. But leases for about a million more square feet are set to expire. On a call last quarter, Aman said she mostly\nanticipates\n\u201cmove-outs,\u201d a point she reiterated on Tuesday\u2019s call. The company anticipates average full year occupancy at 76 percent to 78 percent, per its guidance.\nKilroy reported a net income of $12 million for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2025, compared to $60 million a year earlier. For the year ended December 2025, the real estate investment trust reported a net income of $276 million compared to $211 million through 2024.\n",

If the deal closes at that price, its $3,313 per square foot would outpace the previous record by 9 percent.\nLast year, Penthouse 1A set the record for a condo sale when it\nclosed for $7.5 million\n, or $3,046 per square foot. That deal also marked the priciest condo sponsor sale in the neighborhood.\nThe new record would represent another win for One Domino in its unofficial battle for the top with\nOne Williamsburg Wharf, a condo component of Naftali Group\u2019s\nbroader redevelopment along the waterfront. The two developments, which launched sales within four months of each other in 2024 and sit less than 10 blocks apart, had traded condo records back and forth over the past few years.\nA penthouse at One Williamsburg Wharf that sold for\n$7.2 million\nat the end of 2024 held the title of priciest sponsor sale in the area for about six months. Before that, a One Domino Square that went for\n$5.8 million\nhad the record.\nSales director Aaron Goed previously downplayed any competition between the buildings. \u201cI think their success helps us, and vice versa, and there\u2019s definitely enough demand to go around,\u201d Goed told\nThe Real Deal\nin June.\nWilliamsburg Wharf will have more cracks at the crown when it launches the project\u2019s second phase, which includes 360 condos across two residential towers known as 80 Wharf Way. That portion is expected to be completed in 2028. Naftali Group and Len Blavatnik\u2019s Access Industries landed\n$525 million in construction loans\nfor the project in December.\nBoth developments have contributed to a surge in home prices in North Brooklyn and the borough\u2019s new development market as a whole. In the fourth quarter, the median sale price in the area spanning Williamsburg and Greenpoint jumped 20 percent annually to a record $1.65 million, according to a report from Corcoran.\nSpanning over 2,100 square feet, Penthouse 3A comes with three bedrooms, three full bathrooms and nearly 1,000 square feet of rooftop outdoor space. The turnkey apartment came furnished by Irish design brand Orior.\nLed by an in-house sales team, over two-thirds of the 160 units in One Domino Square\u2019s condo portion have sold. The development also includes a 399-unit rental portion and is part of Two Trees\u2019 larger development site that includes and surrounds the old Domino Sugar refinery.\n",

        "content": "Ranco Capital and the Gilardian family are approaching the checkered flag on a luxury rental development in Murray Hill, securing a nine-figure loan to push the development across the finish line.\nRanco and the Gilardians landed a $115 million loan to refinance the 22-story project at 162 East 36th Street, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. Affinius Capital provided the debt, which was arranged by Galaxy Capital\u2019s Henry Bodek.\nThe financing is expected to go towards completing construction \u2014 which is anticipated to wrap this year \u2014 and stabilizing the property through lease-up.\nRanco did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe 160-unit project sits on the corner of Third Avenue and East 36th Street. It will include 87 studios, 46 one-bedrooms and 27 two-bedroom units, along with 3,700 square feet of retail space on the ground floor.\nThe developers previously scored an $87 million construction loan from BridgeCity Capital in September 2024, according to\nPincusCo\n, split between $82 million in senior debt and $5 million in mezzanine debt. The prior lender to that was Safra National Bank, which held debt with an original amount of $23.1 million.\nRun by Joseph Banda, Ranco is based in Brooklyn. It made waves in 2023 when it received\nrezoning approval\nto pave the way for a rental development at 703 Myrtle Avenue in Brooklyn\u2019s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. Ranco\u2019s planned mixed-use building would\u2019ve brought 54 rental units to the block, including 18 affordable to households earning less than 80 percent of the area median income.\nRanco sold the site to Blue Sky Developers eight months ago for $10.8 million, according to\nCrain\u2019s\n.\nThe Gilardians typically do business under Gilar Realty, which refinanced 237 East 34th Street with 105 units in Murray Hill and 114 West 86th Street with 49 units on the Upper West Side with\na $55.75 million loan\nfrom Bank of Montreal in February 2023. The apartment buildings are co-owned by Alex Forkosh\u2019s Forkosh Development Group.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

They tapped the architecture firm GarciaStromberg to design the Ritz-Carlton Residences, Fort Lauderdale Beach, with interiors by Dan Fink Studio.\nPrices start at $2.5 million.\nThe partners bought the 1.5-acre waterfront site for $30 million in 2023, property records show.\nThe Ritz-Carlton will have units spanning between two- and three-bedrooms, ranging from 1,600 to 3,500 square feet, the release shows.

Amenities in the complex will include two pools, dock slips, a catering kitchen, screening room, multi-sport simulator, meeting room and children\u2019s playroom, the release shows.\nUlis and MICL, helmed by chairman emeritus Parag Shah, tapped Douglas Elliman Development Marketing to lead sales and marketing for the project.\nFort Lauderdale has emerged as a hub of luxury condo development in recent years. As prices for dev sites in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties have skyrocketed, developers have turned to Fort Lauderdale and surrounding Broward markets as a more affordable alternative.\nThere are\nmore than two dozen projects totaling nearly 4,000 units\nin the pipeline across coastal Broward markets, particularly concentrated in Fort Lauderdale and Pompano Beach.\nFor example, Miki Naftali is planning\na 45-story, 370-unit Viceroy-branded condo\nproject.\nRelated Group has invested heavily in Broward County condo projects.

        "content": "As Indiana officials loudly court the Chicago Bears with a publicly funded stadium pitch, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker says his state is gaining ground in negotiations to keep the NFL franchise.\nPritzker said Monday that he and his team have made \u201cprogress\u201d in talks with the Bears, even as Republican leaders in Indiana push legislation designed to lure the franchise across the border, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. The comments come amid heightened maneuvering on both sides of the state line, with billions of dollars in real estate and infrastructure hanging in the balance.\nPritzker\u2019s January calendar showed two scheduled conversations with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell while\nGoodell was in Chicago\nfor the Bears-Packers playoff game on Jan. 10, according to the outlet. During that visit, Goodell toured the Bears\u2019 preferred site in Arlington Heights \u2014 the former Arlington Park racetrack the team owns \u2014 as well as potential sites in northwest Indiana, including land near Wolf Lake in Hammond.\nAt the heart of the Illinois talks are long-running disputes over how much public support the Bears should receive for a new stadium and surrounding development. Those issues include who pays for infrastructure around the Arlington Heights site, how the team\u2019s future property taxes would be assessed and whether the state would help cover debt tied to Soldier Field renovations completed more than 20 years ago.\nThe Bears have pegged infrastructure needs alone at $855 million. The team has said it would privately finance the stadium itself,\naccording\nto Crain\u2019s, anchoring a proposed $5 billion mixed-use campus with commercial and residential components in Arlington Heights.\nIndiana, meanwhile, is offering a more straightforward \u2014 and costlier \u2014 proposition. Since the Bears signaled in December that an out-of-state move was on the table, Indiana Gov. Mike Braun has pushed legislation to create a Northwest Indiana Stadium Authority empowered to build and finance an NFL stadium with public dollars. Insiders have put the potential price tag north of $3.5 billion.\nThe\nIndiana Senate\nhas already passed a bill establishing the authority, and the House speaker has said he supports it. The clock is ticking: The Legislature is set to adjourn by the end of the month.\nUnder the Indiana proposal, the Bears would sign a lease of at least 35 years, pay operating and maintenance costs and keep all stadium-generated revenue. The team would also have the option to buy the stadium for $1 at the end of the lease \u2014 or sooner, if construction debt is paid off.\nBack in Illinois, Pritzker struck an optimistic tone during an unrelated appearance in Belleville.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of discussion, a lot of ongoing conversation with the\nBears\n, and indeed, frankly, progress that\u2019s been made,\u201d he said, while declining to outline specific concessions. \u201cWe\u2019re not throwing money at building a stadium for anybody.\u201d\nThe Tribune reported that Pritzker\u2019s office signed a new $25,000 contract in late December with an outside attorney to advise the administration in negotiations through the end of June.\nA major sticking point remains: a proposed \u201cmegaproject\u201d bill backed by the Bears and\nArlington Heights officials\n. The legislation would allow the team to negotiate long-term property tax terms with local taxing bodies, requiring a change in state law. Arlington Heights Village Manager Randy Recklaus said the village, state and team are \u201cactively working together to solve outstanding issues\u201d and that talks are moving quickly.\nThe Bears declined to comment. Pritzker said he believes the Indiana threat is real, not a bluff.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The federal government is lightening its real estate load in Central Texas, handing off more than 240 acres of underused land near the San Marcos Regional Airport to local entities.\nThe U.S. General Services Administration said it transferred two former Department of Labor properties east of the airport to\nTexas State University\nand the city of\nSan Marcos\n, moving the sites out of federal ownership as part of a broader push to reduce excess property holdings, according to federal and local officials, MySa.com\nreported\n.\nGSA Administrator Edward C. Forst framed the move as part of the Trump administration\u2019s cost-cutting agenda in a statement, calling it \u201ca victory for the American taxpayer.\u201d\nThe land breaks down into two tracts. One spans more than 195 acres and includes a cluster of buildings near William Pettis Road east of the San Marcos Regional Airport, while the other covers roughly 45 acres of\nundeveloped land\n. Earlier this year, Texas State University took title to about 75 acres from the northern portion of the larger tract, including the existing facilities.\nThe city of San Marcos later acquired the balance of the property, nearly 170 acres in total, for $1.7 million through a negotiated sale. GSA said the transaction was completed in coordination with local and federal partners and followed all required disposal rules, formally removing the land from the federal inventory.\nTexas State plans to keep using its portion of the site for the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center, known as ALERRT, a nationally recognized program that trains law enforcement officers and first responders and supports research on active shooter response. The outlet reported that the expansion is expected to allow the university to serve more agencies from around the country, according to a statement from Texas State President Kelly Damphousse.\nSan Marcos city officials said the land will be used to support future expansion of the regional airport, a growing property as the\nAustin-San Antonio corridor\ncontinues to densify.\nCity Manager Stephanie Reyes pointed to economic development and land use compatibility around the airport, calling it \u201can important step in supporting the long-term needs of the entire San Marcos community.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "As South Florida\u2019s decadeslong housing affordability crisis surged in the past few years, developers in Miami took note \u2013\u2013 unlike those in Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach.\nIn Miami-Dade County, 8,690 affordable units were completed from 2020 through 2024, according to RentCafe, a Yardi Systems-owned apartment listing and research platform. That marks a 97 percent increase from the deliveries in the Magic City from the period from 2015 to 2019.\nMiami ranked 10th nationwide for the number of\naffordable\nunits finished, yet affordable housing construction slowed elsewhere in South Florida.\nIn\nPalm Beach County\n, 1,069 units were completed from 2020 through 2024, a 15 percent decline from the previous five-year period.\nBroward County\nhad 955 affordable unit completions from 2020 through 2024, an 18 percent drop from the previous five years.\nThe findings come as the state and South Florida officials have been working to incentivize the construction of more below-market apartments. During a pandemic era influx of out-of-staters, South Florida experienced unprecedented housing demand and record rent growth, exacerbating the lack of affordable housing.\nAmong the projects finished in Miami is Swerdlow Group\u2019s Sawyer\u2019s Walk in Overtown with\n578 apartments\nrestricted for seniors earning up to 60 percent of the area median income. Swerdlow finished the project in 2024 in partnership with JM Partners and Alben Duffie.\nRelated Urban Development Group, the affordable housing arm of the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related Group, has been completing in phases the redevelopment of Liberty Square in Miami\u2019s Liberty City, so far delivering close to 800 rentals, including public housing, project-based voucher units, affordable and workforce units.\nStill, the report only accounted for entirely affordable developments, excluding mixed-income buildings that include apartments at market rents. This essentially excludes Live Local Act projects, which can have a mix of incomes as long as 40 percent of apartments are reserved for households earning no more than 120 percent of the area median income.\nSouth Florida developers still are mostly prioritizing market-rate rentals, as the affordable housing deliveries from 2020 through 2024 represent a drop compared to total multifamily completions.\nMiami-Dade\u2019s completions represented 19 percent of total apartment deliveries, while they accounted for 8 percent and 4 percent of total deliveries in Palm Beach County and Broward County, respectively, according to the report.\nBut the jump to affordable housing also could stem from South Florida\u2019s slowdown of market-rate units. Developers seized on the pandemic bonanza with plans for new projects, which led to hefty deliveries in recent years just as the in-migration slowed. This led to a supply overhang, with slower leaseups and an increase in concessions. By contrast, demand for affordable units is close to ensured in South Florida.\nNationwide, nearly 310,000 affordable apartments were finished, a 73 percent increase from the completions from the prior five-year period, the report says. Seattle took the lead, followed by New York, Austin, Minneapolis/St.Paul and Atlanta.\nSan Antonio, which ranked ninth in total unit completions, along with Phoenix and Charlotte, also had the fastest growth in affordable housing construction, recording a 222.5 percent, 206.3 percent and 191 percent increase in completions compared with the previous five years.\n",

Formerly known as the VIP Apartments,\nSan Francisco-based FPA\nhas renamed the property ReNew Lake Arlington, joining with other properties in the area sharing the ReNew branding.\nThe seller was an entity tied to the Manda family, which had owned the apartment complex for many years. Reached by phone, Mark Manda confirmed the sale, stating that he has sold off his real estate holdings as part of a move into retirement. He declined to comment further on the specifics of the transaction, though the sale price represents a significant payday for the legacy owner of the property built in 1972.\nIt had been encumbered by relatively low leverage for years, with a Mark Manda-led entity taking out a $15 million Freddie Mac-backed loan originated by CBRE against the property in 2021, public records show.\nFPA\u2019s acquisition arrives amid a flurry of big deals at the start of the year in Chicagoland\u2019s apartment market. Last month,\nOsso Capital offloaded a massive complex in Crest Hill for $110 million\n, about the same time eight-figure deals for properties in Aurora and Palatine closed. Together, they signal institutional appetite for suburban Chicago density remains at a fever pitch.\nThis wave of activity follows FPA setting the market\u2019s high bar in 2025, suggesting investors are eager to lock in early in the year as Chicago\u2019s stature rises to the top for many multifamily investors due to a lack of new development. FPA didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\nThe firm\u2019s recent acquisition highlights Chicago\u2019s emergence as a top-tier performer on the national stage. While overdevelopment has led to an inventory surplus in Sun Belt cities, Chicago\u2019s building pipeline has essentially hit a bottleneck. Local construction starts have plummeted to a low not seen since 2012. This scarcity is creating a tight squeeze for renters, as landlords have the upper hand in lease rate negotiations.\n\u201cDevelopers indicate virtually every proposed deal is in a holding pattern,\u201d Chicago-based Integra Realty Resources said in its annual outlook for the region last month. \u201cWhile banks are willing to issue construction loans, attracting equity remains a challenge. Rising rental rates and strong overall market fundamentals will compel equity to return to the market. However, we don\u2019t anticipate any material new (downtown Chicago) construction deliveries until at least 2028.\u201d\nMedian rent was up 3.2 percent in the suburban market in the third quarter, year-over-year, with strong occupancy at 97.6 percent, Integra found.\nFor FPA, the Wheeling property is the latest piece in a sprawling regional portfolio. While the firm made a rare exit in early 2025 by selling a Downers Grove property to Laramar Group, its recent activity has been defined by massive capital deployment. The firm\u2019s dominance was most visible in December, when it closed Chicago\u2019s largest multifamily deal of the year: a $175 million purchase of a luxury tower in Streeterville. That blockbuster was followed weeks later by an\n$89 million purchase in the same neighborhood\n.\nFPA\u2019s strategy has been equally focused on Chicago\u2019s suburban collar. In July 2024, the firm spent\n$102 million on a Hoffman Estates property\n, and in March, it utilized an assumable debt structure to acquire another suburban Naperville property for a total of $68 million.\n",

The California-based firm broke ground in March of last year, marking a major milestone for a development that has steadily grown in scale, scope and cost since its initial approval in 2019.\nOriginally pitched as a $200 million, 1 million-square-foot project, The District has since ballooned into a nearly 4 million-square-foot campus expected to cost north of $500 million at full build-out, based on prior\nreporting\n. The 66-acre site sits near the intersection of I-35 and State Highway 45, adjacent to Dell Technologies\u2019 sprawling\nRound Rock headquarters\n\u2014 a proximity Mark IV has repeatedly cited as a core selling point.\nThe construction loan was led by BDT &amp; MSD Partners, with participation from an affiliate of Apollo Global Management. George Smith Partners served as financial advisor and placement agent, advising on capitalization strategy, lender engagement and execution.\nThe loan will fund vertical construction of Phase I, which centers on luxury multifamily and retail, according to the outlet.\nThe headline component of the first phase is a seven-story,\n316-unit apartment building\n, constructed with five levels of wood-frame construction atop a two-level concrete podium. Units will include studios, one- and two-bedroom apartments, with more than 23,000 square feet of ground-floor retail, according to the publication. Amenities aim to compete at the high end of the suburban Austin market, including a third-floor pool deck, cold plunge, dry sauna, fitness center and clubhouse lounge.\nPhase I also includes a 40,750-square-foot food-and-beverage plaza made up of six standalone buildings, with spaces ranging from 1,500 square feet to nearly 12,000 square feet. Mark IV is pitching the plaza as an early foot-traffic driver and economic catalyst for later phases.\nAt full build-out, targeted for completion in about 2039,\nThe District\nis expected to include office, multifamily, retail and hospitality uses and support up to 5,000 jobs.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Retting Gun Store, when it was closing in 2023, for more than $6 million to prevent another one from opening, KTLA\nreported\n.\nCulver City officials previously considered applications from developers before directing staff to enter into an exclusive negotiation agreement with West Hollywood Community Housing for the affordable housing development.\nThe developer\u2019s plan calls for replacing a triangular commercial building at 11029 Washington Boulevard with a seven-story residential structure with 67 affordable units along with ground-floor artist spaces and a community art center. The project is expected to cost roughly $50.2 million, or about $749,000 per unit.\nWashington Palms would consist of one- and two-bedroom apartments intended for households earning between 30 and 80 percent of the\narea median income\n. In Los Angeles County, that would work out to an annual income of between $31,850 and $84,850 for one person, or $45,450 to $121,150 for a household of four.\nThe EYRC Architects designed the development.\nThe developer proposed using off-site\nmodular construction\nmethods to speed completion of the project.\nCulver City is required to\nplan\nfor 3,341 new housing units by 2029 under the city\u2019s housing element.

Chicago-based\nHabitat Company\n, working on behalf of Red Cup Land Company, will rezone the property from industrial to residential and begin construction this spring, with an 18 to 24-month buildout timeline.\nPlans call for\n227 townhomes\nspread across 48 building assemblies, with parking tucked into first-floor garages and supplemented by on-street spaces. The project includes nearly 13 acres of open space, internal private roads and a clubhouse with a pool, according to approved plans. Thirty-four units will be set aside as affordable housing under Highland Park\u2019s inclusionary housing rules.\nMayor Nancy Rotering praised the outcome after the vote, saying \u201ca city growing is a city progressing.\u201d\nThe vote, however, was not without friction, as some council members approved the project alongside two amendments aimed at addressing safety and quality-of-life concerns raised by nearby residents.\nA proposed pedestrian crossing at Ridge Road and Devonshire Court drew sharp criticism from neighbors, who warned it would create a dangerous traffic condition, the outlet reported. As part of the final approval, the council removed the crosswalk from the initial plan and deferred any decision on adding it until the development reaches 90 percent occupancy.\nCouncil members also raised concerns about the project\u2019s proximity to Bluegrass, a nearby restaurant. One amendment asks the developer to increase the buffer between the eatery and an adjacent parking area, pushing beyond the originally proposed 2.5 feet if feasible.\nThe developer also agreed to set aside $25,000 in escrow to cover unforeseen issues during construction. City Attorney Steve Elrod said at the meeting that the city will have sole discretion over whether and how those funds are used.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The third time might be the charm for a site in\nWest Berkeley\nthat has twice been considered for housing in recent years.\nLos Altos-based developer California Supportive Housing filed an application last week with the City of Berkeley to build a 94-unit, 100-percent affordable apartment building at 2147 San Pablo Avenue, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The proposal calls for demolishing an existing auto body and auto glass shop to make way for a six-story\nworkforce housing\nbuilding with a 46-space parking garage.\nIf approved, the development would bring \u201cmuch needed affordable workforce housing to a commercial district along a major transit corridor in West Berkeley,\u201d California Supportive Housing\u2019s application said.\nThe developer is using\nAB 2011\n, which limits zoning changes after applications are filed and streamlines approvals for housing on commercial sites. The firm took advantage of the state\ndensity bonus\n, which permits developers to build more housing on a site than zoning rules would typically allow in exchange for a certain number of affordable units.\nThe site is owned by Alameda-based Wang Brothers Investments, which purchased the location in 2022 for nearly $2.8 million. Wang Brothers applied to build a 128-unit co-living development with ground-floor retail at the site. That effort appears to be inactive, according to the Business Times. Wang Brothers, in tandem with Studio KDA, submitted several plan revisions, including increasing the number of units to 144 and cutting down on the ground-floor retail space. The plan was last updated in November 2024 and was considered by the Design Review Commission in February 2025.\nThat was the second proposal submitted for the site. The previous owner, an unnamed applicant, floated building a 44-unit apartment building geared toward students at the University of California, Berkeley.\nAs Berkeley faces an ongoing housing shortage, developers have been filing applications to build residences to fill the gap. New state housing laws like AB 2011,\nSB 330\nand California\u2019s density bonus have made new construction projects more financially feasible. Many of those proposals are centered around the UC Berkeley campus east of downtown.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Tarrytown has long been\none of Austin\u2019s trendiest neighborhoods\n. (Just ask\nEmma Stone\n.) But last year, its home sale prices dropped more than in any other neighborhood in the city.\nDespite being\none of the wealthiest ZIP codes in Texas\n, home sales in ZIP code 78703 fell more than in any other ZIP code in\nAustin\nin 2025, year over year, according to Multiple Listing Service data published by Team Price Real Estate. Although Austin\u2019s private listing scene obscures the full picture, agents say that luxury buyers\u2019 interest in the neighborhood has lessened since the housing boom of the pandemic.\nThe 252 homes sold in Tarrytown last year averaged a sale price of $1.5 million, an 11 percent drop from the average sale price of $1.7 million in 2024 \u2014 and the greatest percentage decline in the city, Team Price reports.\nMeanwhile, the fellow luxury strongholds of\nDowntown\nand Westlake generally held flat, indicating that Austin\u2019s lapse in luxury demand isn\u2019t affecting the market uniformly. The average sale price of a Downtown Austin home rose by less than $1,000 in 2025, year-over-year, hovering at about $1 million. In Westlake, the average sale price fell by just 1 percent, from $2.22 million to $2.19 million.\nAll of Austin inflated during the pandemic, as the city attracted buyers from the coasts. Now that many of those buyers are leaving, enduring value remains in neighborhoods like Westlake, which is within the exemplary Eanes Independent School District, while the froth is being skimmed away from neighborhoods like Tarrytown, said Moreland Properties agent Greg Walling.\n\u201cAs the market softened, those out-of-town buyers have moved on or decided to go back home, or whatever the case may be. And so some of those sales [dropped in value] in some people\u2019s eyes, even though they were just elevated in such a quick manner,\u201d Walling said.\nHowever, due to a widespread preference for off-market trades among Austin luxury sellers, MLS data captures only a portion of the true market, according to Amy Deane, the top producer for 2025 at Moreland Properties.\n\u201c\nIf I have a waterfront house, and it\u2019s worth $20 million\nand it\u2019s on the tax roll at three and a half [million], we\u2019re going to do everything we can to sell it off-market. Because no buyer is going to want to pay market price when the taxes are a fifth of what it\u2019s actually worth,\u201d Deane said.\n\u201cMost of our sales of luxury homes are never hitting the public market, so nobody knows what they\u2019re selling for,\u201d she added.\nEven so, the luxury market has cooled significantly since the heat of 2021. While the resale market evades comprehensive analysis, spec homes and land are both cheaper in Tarrytown lately, Deane said. The price of an acre in ZIP code 78703 jumped by almost $1 million from 2021 to 2022 and fell by about $100,000 by 2024, according to the\nAmerican Enterprise Institute\n.\n\u201cLate 2020 and early 2021, I was writing offers for buyers that were like, \u2018All cash over ask\u2019; \u2018No inspection\u2019; \u2018We love your home, and we love your cat and your dog, and we\u2019ll adopt your kids if you let us buy the house.\u2019 After the surge, you didn\u2019t have to do that anymore,\u201d Deane said.\nFewer elite sales are taking place behind the scenes as a result\n.\n\u201cA property I have on Northumberland [Road} that sold in the fives [millions], I would have always sold that off-market,\u201d Deane said. \u201cI had to sell it on market last year because I needed the visibility.\u201d\n",

        "content": "For whatever reason, the Mamdani administration chose Super Bowl Sunday \u2014 four hours before kickoff \u2014 to release an updated list of buildings in the dreaded\nAlternative Enforcement Program\n.\nThe mayor\u2019s office didn\u2019t bury the news in order to spare landlords bad publicity. Just two days later it made a\nbig show\nof announcing its \u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings, which have outraged and scared owners even before the first hearing.\nIn his press release about the\nupdated AEP list\n, Mayor Zohran Mamdani vowed, \u201cNew York will no longer look the other way while bad landlords put tenants at risk.\u201d\nBut AEP is in its 19th year. Clearly the city has not been looking the other way. The problem is, AEP has not been very effective, despite imposing penalties and charging landlords several times the normal cost of repairs. It tends to put out some fires in a building, then move on without fixing the fundamental problems.\nIf AEP worked well, the crisis of violations Mamdani keeps calling out would not exist. Yet his new list was accompanied only by bluster, not reforms.\nWhen\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s Quinn Waller looked into what happened to buildings owned by\nnotorious landlord Aron Stark\nafter they were thrown into AEP, she found few signs of progress.\nNor did it inspire changes in Stark\u2019s stewardship of the buildings.\nWaller reported last fall that the city put 1422 Greene Avenue into AEP in 2021 and has since made some repairs and billed them to Stark. But he hadn\u2019t paid, and as of Oct. 1 the 12-unit building still had 79 open violations, 32 of them immediately hazardous.\nToday it has 80 open HPD violations, 67 of which are class B or C. It also has six active\nbuilding violations\nand eight open\nenvironmental violations\n. Stark hasn\u2019t even filed a property registration form since 2020, and tenants have said he\u2019s abandoned the building.\nYet somehow 1422 Greene Avenue was removed from the AEP list.\nInstead Mamdani singled out 34-15 Parsons Boulevard in Queens, a 175-unit A&amp;E building which the mayor said has more than 1,000 \u201cof the most serious violations.\u201d But half of the building\u2019s\n1,239 violations\nhave been fixed \u2014 they just haven\u2019t been cleared because HPD hasn\u2019t reinspected them. Another 1,200 violations have been cleared.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot of work in that building to clear these violations,\u201d said Douglas Eisenberg, A&amp;E\u2019s CEO. \u201cWe\u2019ve invested $10 million into the building.\u201d\nIt has apparently been years since Ari Stark \u2014 a landlord who was once\njailed\nfor neglecting his properties \u2014 has even put 10 cents into his Greene Avenue building. That the city took his building off the bad-boy list and put Douglas Eisenberg\u2019s on it tells you there\u2019s more than a little theater going on.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill Mark Levine, the new city comptroller, dial back the\nproject-hampering 485x rules\njust proposed by his office? The draft rules were largely prepared under Levine\u2019s predecessor, Brad Lander, who claimed to be\npro-housing\nbut\nsometimes wasn\u2019t\n, and this proposal is another example. Levine is\nmore enthusiastic\nabout adding housing supply and now has a chance to prove it, though doing so will irk the construction unions. Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Only 13.7 percent of single-family homes are occupied by renters, the lowest share in more than 15 years, a Redfin\nanalysis\nof census data found. Housing myth-buster Jay Parsons\nposted\nthe stat.\nElsewhere\u2026\nThe\nnew law\nrequiring landlords to install air-conditioning by June 2030 for tenants who request it has been deemed by some as another nail in the coffin of rent-stabilized housing.\nBut a closer reading of the bill suggests its impact will be modest, perhaps even minimal.\nOne line says, \u201cThe Department of Housing Preservation and Development would provide notice to tenants to characterize the potential impacts of opting into the program on their rent.\u201d\nThe law says a rent-stabilized tenant would have to consent to a rent increase \u2014 via an individual apartment improvement \u2014 to get air conditioning. This key fact was\nmissing\nfrom nearly all of the\nmedia coverage\nof the bill.\nFor units that are individually metered, as most are, tenants would also have to pay higher electricity bills to use the A/C. The prospect of higher rent and higher utility bills should dissuade many from demanding the upgrade.\nThe New York Apartment Association pushed for changes to the legislation by Council member Lincoln Restler, D-Brooklyn, which passed 40 to 7 on Dec. 18. It became law without Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 signature.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$37.25 million\nfor a 3,703-square-foot resale condominium at 220 Central Park South. Manju Jasty with The Corcoran Group had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$40 million\nfor Metropolitan College of New York\u2019s 100,000-square-foot property at 40 Rector Place in the Financial District.\nThe Real Deal\nreported\non the deal to the City University of New York in August.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$20 million\nfor a 3,851-square-foot condominium unit at 275 West 10th Street in the West Village. Jessica Chestler and Ben Jacobs of Douglas Elliman have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 210,689-square-foot, four-story, 32-unit residential building at 2105 Tillotson Ave in Eastchester. Nikolai Katz filed the permit on behalf of Tucker Shane of 33 Equities Acquires.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "Facing a tidal wave of resident opposition, representatives for billionaire Jeffrey Soffer\u2019s Fontainebleau Miami Beach delayed a crucial vote on his plan to renovate the iconic waterfront resort\u2019s pool amenities.\nThe Miami Beach Historic Preservation Board was scheduled Tuesday to approve or deny Fontainebleau Miami Beach\u2019s application to add cabanas and waterslides at the 1,593-room hotel at\n4441 Collins Avenue\n. Instead, the board voted 6-0 to table the item until a later date at the owner\u2019s request because a seventh board member, Haskel Meyer, was absent.\n\u201cThe Fontainebleau team was fully prepared to present the proposal and welcomed the opportunity for dialogue,\u201d a spokesperson for the resort said in a statement. \u201cBut requested a deferral so the full board could be present to consider the item during a future meeting this summer.\u201d\nThe Miami Beach City Commission chambers, where the board meets, was packed with residents holding signs opposing the project, outnumbering a phalanx of Fontainebleau Miami Beach supporters in blue T-shirts. Videos obtained by\nThe Real Deal\nshowed two Miami Beach police officers and a security guard ushering away residents who demanded the item be considered.\n\u201cAsking for a deferral because of one missing board member was an excuse,\u201d Alicia Casanova told\nThe Real Deal\nafter the meeting.\nShe suggested Fontainebleau Miami Beach officials \u201cgot scared of losing. It\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d\nCasanova is president of the master condo association for the Blue Diamond and Green Diamond, two condominiums near Fontainebleau Miami Beach.\nAnamarie Ferreira de Melo, president of the MidBeach Neighborhood Association, said a majority of the organization\u2019s members oppose Fontainebleau Miami Beach\u2019s plan because they believe it will add more traffic and negatively impact a planned infrastructure project on Collins Avenue.\n\u201cMBNA has always supported development that is compatible and that is thoughtful for our community,\u201d Ferreira de Melo said. \u201cFor this one, we\u2019re unable to do so. Of course, traffic is something that gets everybody very upset. It\u2019s a trigger for anyone who lives in Mid-Beach.\u201d\nThis marks the third time the board has delayed a vote on the pool amenities plan. In November, the board voted for a deferral to give\nFontainebleau Miami Beach\ntime to meet with opposing residents and neighborhood associations to address criticisms about the planned renovation, which entails a cabana structure and an aluminum waterslide tower.\nFontainebleau Miami Beach\nrepresentatives presented an updated plan to the MidBeach Neighborhood Association last month showing the cabana structure was reduced from two stories to 1.4 stories, and the waterslide tower\u2019s height was slashed to 99 feet tall from 131 feet tall.\nHowever, a majority of residents who attended the presentation were unfazed, and continued to criticize the planned renovation. Miami Beach Mayor\nSteven Meiner\nalso spoke out against the proposal even though the city commission will not get to vote on it.\nFollowing the neighborhood meeting, Fontainebleau Miami Beach requested a second deferral to this month.\nSince then, Soffer\u2019s Aventura-based firm\nFontainebleau Development\nhas implemented a public relations campaign similar to that of a project on public land requiring voter approval. The developer hired political consultant Christian Ulvert to run the campaign. Ulvert managed the campaign for Miami Mayor Eileen Higgins, who won in a runoff in December. He also managed Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava\u2019s runs in 2020 and 2024.\nFontainebleau Development also retained Miami-based polling firm MDW Communications to survey 305 Miami Beach voters last month. According to the poll\u2019s results, 39 percent of the respondents said they had heard a little about the pool renovation and another 24 percent had heard a lot about it. The remainder had not heard anything about it, the poll results show.\nWhen provided details about the project, 31 percent of the respondents said they strongly support it, 27 percent said they somewhat support it, 18 percent said they strongly oppose it, 11 percent said they somewhat oppose it and 12 percent had no opinion.\n\u201cThe Fontainebleau proposal is about reinvesting in one of Miami Beach\u2019s most iconic landmarks in a way that honors its history while preparing it for the future,\u201d the spokesperson\u2019s statement said. \u201cAll while maintaining the property\u2019s existing footprint, without increasing density or adding traffic.\u201d\nMark Weiss, a Miami Beach-based attorney who has been a leading critic, dismissed the campaign as \u201cmanufactured propaganda.\u201d\n\u201cThe swell of opposition is like something never before seen,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cThe manufactured fake public support vanished very quickly and ran for the hills.\u201d",

        "content": "Rodeo Drive could get more orange after a record-setting retail acquisition on the world-famous corridor.\nHerm\u00e8s has been revealed as\nthe buyer behind\nwhat Wall Street Journal said is the largest-ever retail real estate purchase on Rodeo Drive, the publication\nreported\n. The luxury French brand spent $400 million to buy 338 North Rodeo Drive, picking up the roughly 25,000-square-foot location\nlast summer\nas part of its acquisition of an affiliate of former owner ECA Capital Limited.\nThe storefronts are currently occupied by Tom Ford, Moncler and Balenciaga. Herm\u00e8s\u2019 plans for the site are not clear, though it might be a while before an Herm\u00e8s store can open there, as the current tenants still maintain leases with several years left. Herm\u00e8s already has a store a block away at 434 North Rodeo Drive, though it\u2019s about half the size of the 338 North Rodeo site.\nThe deal is believed to be the second-priciest sale in Beverly Hills history after British developers Nicholas and Christian Candy spent $500 million for a former Robinsons-May department store at 9900 Wilshire Boulevard in 2007. The 338 North Rodeo sale sets a one-property record for the Rodeo retail corridor.\nOther significant purchases on the street in recent years include\nLVMH\n\u2019s $245 million purchase of a 22,300-square-foot, two-story building at 468 North Rodeo, hotelier Efrem Harkham\u2019s $200 million sale of a 43,000-square-foot hotel and retail site at 360 North Rodeo and Crown Equity\u2019s\nsale of two storefronts\nspanning 11,600 square feet at 457-459 North Rodeo Drive for $122 million.\nHerm\u00e8s already owns its store\u2019s current Rodeo Drive location, which it purchased in 2011 for $75 million as its first U.S. real estate acquisition, Luxury Retail Market\nreported\n. The brand rents many of its other store locations, including its New York City flagship on Madison Avenue.\nSince the pandemic, retailers have increasingly had to compete for real estate in Beverly Hills as luxury companies have been purchasing properties and leaving less available space for others. Asking rent prices have increased nearly 50 nearly since 2019, per CBRE data cited by the Journal. \u201cWhat you see now on Rodeo Drive is not only a commitment by the luxury brands that are able to buy their real estate, but you\u2019re seeing the buildings get much bigger,\u201d Newmark\u2019s Jay Luchs, who brokered the 338 North Rodeo deal, told WSJ.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Landlord Trinity Flood is fighting to hang onto the South Shore apartment complex federal authorities raided last fall by trying to fend off her lender\u2019s foreclosure, even after a judge\nappointed a receiver\nto take over the building and\nordered remaining tenants to move\nout due to dangerous living conditions.\nThe Wisconsin-based investor\u2019s latest legal maneuvers add to a growing history of tense litigation she has brought in the past eight years against multiple people she has worked alongside and negotiated with in the real estate industry, including her own immediate Flood family members who have decades of investment experience in the mobile homes sector,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nFlood\u2019s 130-unit Chicago property at 7500 South South Shore Drive made international headlines in October when Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and other federal agencies led a military-style raid on the property, descending from helicopters and emerging from unmarked cars to detain migrants living in the building. Tenants at the time said that agents detained nearly every person in the building, including U.S. citizens, during the raid. Some were released while others were sent to immigration detention.\nLegal experts have since\nquestioned whether the raid violated federal search and seizure laws\nand the\nstate of Illinois opened an investigation\ninto whether or not the Wisconsin-based landlord or the property management company she hired, Chicago-based Strength in Management, tipped off ICE.\nThe probe centers on claims that Flood or the property management company requested the raid to coerce Black and Hispanic residents \u2014 including U.S. citizens \u2014 into moving out, which could constitute a violation of state housing discrimination laws. The state opened the investigation last month and it is still ongoing.\nTrouble at the South Shore Drive property\nbegan escalating\nin 2024 when Flood stopped hiring security, squatters began occupying empty units and criminal activity ticked up within the building. It\u2019s unclear, however, if any of the crimes that took place at the property can be tied back to the detained migrants specifically. Federal prosecutors haven\u2019t filed any criminal charges against anyone who was arrested during the raid, ProPublica reported last week.\nMeanwhile, Flood has been\nfighting a foreclosure lawsuit\nfiled by Wells Fargo, which is serving as the trustee for bondholders of a $27 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan tied to 7500 South South Shore Drive as well as two other multifamily properties in Chicago, three in Georgia and one in Arizona. Wells Fargo filed three separate foreclosure lawsuits in each state to address Flood\u2019s default on the loan, which occurred several months before the raid.\nThe Georgia and Arizona cases are much further along in the foreclosure process. The three Georgia properties were auctioned off in November and are now owned by Wells Fargo entities, CMBS loan tracking service Morningstar Credit reported last month. An auction date for the Arizona property is in the process of being scheduled, according to Morningstar.\nBut Flood is battling in court to maintain control of her remaining three properties in Chicago. She and her attorney didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nIn a motion filed in Cook County Circuit Court last week, Flood doubled down on the argument that a lender-placed insurance policy on her three Chicago buildings dramatically increased her operating costs and led her to default on her loan payments.\nFlood claims that in 2023, she was paying $93,000 a year to insure the three South Side buildings. In 2024, Wells Fargo\u2019s loan servicer required Flood to take out a new policy that cost over $100,000 per month, resulting in a 977 percent increase to Flood\u2019s insurance costs for the buildings. The plan was based on artificially inflated property values, she claims.\nWells Fargo, however, alleges that the insurance costs are appropriate and that loan servicer K-Star had to issue lender-placed insurance for the properties because Flood had allowed her coverage to lapse and failed to secure a new policy.\nWells Fargo is also pushing to get a receiver appointed to the other two apartment buildings in Flood\u2019s Chicago portfolio at 6916 South Clyde Avenue and 7038 South Chappel Avenue, a new filing submitted last week shows. Representatives of Wells Fargo and its attorney didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nThe other two Chicago properties haven\u2019t drawn as much scrutiny as the South Shore Drive building but have faced building code violations. A fire at the Clyde Avenue property in 2021 injured four people including a Chicago firefighter.\nFlood\u2019s efforts to hang onto the trio of Chicago buildings despite legal headwinds follows a pattern of aggressive tactics she has deployed to establish her career in real estate.\nFamily drama\nPrior to Flood\u2019s purchase of the South Side buildings, people familiar with the deal said she wasn\u2019t well-known among industry insiders in Chicago.\nBut a 2018 lawsuit filed in Wisconsin lends context to her real estate background.\nAbout a year before Flood bought the Chicago, Georgia and Arizona properties, a Neenah, Wisconsin-based woman with the same name had a contentious falling out with her brother and father, court records show.\nSources familiar with the situation confirmed that the woman who filed the Wisconsin lawsuit is the same person who bought the Chicago, Georgia and Arizona properties. Documents related to the purchase and the family legal dispute both list Trinity Flood as a resident of Neenah, Wisconsin, a town with a population of about 27,000 people, according to the U.S. Census.\nTrinity Flood sued her father, Mark Flood, and brother, Eric Flood, in 2018 over a series of business-related disputes tied to their third-generation mobile home business in Wisconsin, called Flood Homes, legal filings show. Mark Flood and Eric Flood as well as their attorneys didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nTrinity Flood claimed at the time she was wrongfully terminated from Flood Homes by Mark Flood \u201cwithout any prior notice,\u201d and that she was told she \u201ccannot have contact with Flood Homes Inc., employees.\u201d\nIn her lawsuit, Trinity Flood asked a Wisconsin judge to dissolve several LLCs in which she shared ownership with Mark and Eric Flood and to oversee the liquidation of assets held by the shared LLCs. She alleged that under one of the entities, Mark was in default on a commercial loan, which justified the dissolution of the entity.\nBut attorneys for both Eric Flood and Mark Flood fired back, alleging that Trinity was \u201casked to avoid interactions with employees of Flood Homes, Inc. as certain employees had complained of [Trinity\u2019s] oppressive and harassing treatment, raising potential liability issues.\u201d\nMark Flood alleged that Trinity Flood filed the lawsuit \u201cin bad faith and for self-interested motives in an attempt to break up the family business which has been in operation for more than 65 years,\u201d and that she is \u201cattempting to force Mark Flood and Eric Flood to sell their personal interests in the business to satisfy her own selfish motives.\u201d\nHe also claimed that Trinity Flood \u201chas taken steps to secretly market the Flood businesses for sale with brokers, including those in business entities in which she has no controlling interest \u2026 and \u201cwrongfully interfered or attempted to interfere with the relationship between Mark and Eric Flood\u201d and third parties, including key lenders and service providers.\nIn his response, Eric Flood\u2019s attorneys added that he was more qualified to oversee business operations than Trinity Flood, and prior to the lawsuit she had tried to sabotage their shared business efforts by \u201cinterfering with lenders and loans\u201d not related to the LLCs named in the lawsuit, and by \u201cintentionally over-leveraging the legal entities with the intentions to depreciate the value.\u201d\n\u201cTrinity Flood has refused to make decisions and/or has engaged in actions or inaction that place business operations and business relationships and the personal investments of Mark Flood and Eric Flood at risk,\u201d Eric Flood\u2019s filing stated.\nThe case was settled with an out-of-court agreement in January 2019.\nOther legal strategies\nAbout a year after the dust settled with Eric and Mark Flood, Trinity Flood assembled a portfolio of apartment buildings in Chicago, Georgia and Arizona. A loan backed by the seven properties was packaged together in a $25 million CMBS offering.\nShortly after she bought the Chicago properties, she filed a lawsuit accusing\nseller Daniel Hedaya of DAX Real Estate\nand his brokers, Aaron Sklar and Noah Birk of Chicago-based Kiser Group, of improperly inflating the property\u2019s values. For the three South Side properties, she had paid $18 million.\nIn the suit, Flood called out the conditions of the South Shore Drive property, where the unsettling raid would later take place, including the need for around-the-clock, on-site security that cost $15,000 monthly. She claimed the prior owner didn\u2019t make her aware of the security requirements, and its brokers prevented her from touring more than two of the 130 units in the complex because the building was almost entirely occupied.\nFlood pointed out the three-building Chicago portfolio had last sold for $11 million in 2017 prior to DAX\u2019s renovations. She alleged the brokers told her the jump in value was due to the improvements and increase in occupancy at the buildings. Hedaya told\nThe Real Deal\nin 2019 that his firm spent \u201cseveral million dollars\u201d on the projects.\nBut at 7500 South Shore, Flood claimed she had been told that all units in the building were renovated when in reality, 21 had been left untouched. She further alleged that the scope of the renovations throughout the building had been exaggerated or misstated.\nThe parties reached a confidential settlement in October 2023.\nBy then, Flood was racking up significant city code violations on the South Side buildings. She has been issued fines for Clyde and Chappel Avenue properties and a lis pendens foreclosure that the city filed against Flood regarding code violations at the South Shore Drive property is still pending as the case plays out in court.\n",

The site, at 5055 Telegraph Avenue, spans 14,370 square feet and is located across the street from a\nWhole Foods Market\nat 5110 Telegraph Avenue.\nIt would be the second Oakland location for\nEmeryville\n-based Grocery Outlet.

        "content": "A piece of presidential lineage is quietly hitting the Austin leasing market.\nLuci Baines Johnson, the daughter of former President\nLyndon B. Johnson\n, placed her former two-story penthouse in downtown Austin\u2019s Norwood Tower up for lease, opening the door for a wide range of potential uses \u2014 from restaurant and hospitality concepts to office or residential space, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe 10,421-square-foot penthouse spans the 14th and 15th floors of the historic structure at 117 West Seventh Street, a 1929 landmark that once stood as\nAustin\u2019s\ntallest building outside of the Texas Capitol. The Johnson family purchased the building in 1997, and later converted the top floors from office space into a private home.\nAustin-based ECR brokers Jason Steinberg and Patrick Ley are marketing the space, which is being pitched less as a traditional lease and more as a flexible canvas for creative users.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a square box where you drop in workstations,\u201d said John Jordan,\nthe Johnson family\u2019s\nlongtime asset manager.\nHe told the publication that interest has already come from office, hospitality and restaurant groups, though the family is keeping an open mind.\n\u201cWhether it continues to be residential or morphs into something different is what we\u2019re taking our time to be thoughtful about,\u201d Jordan said.\nThe penthouse includes elevator access to both floors, internal stairs to a private gym on the 16th floor and six private terraces. Other features include a small chapel, a full kitchen, on-site parking and direct access to Perry\u2019s Steakhouse &amp; Grille on the ground floor.\nJohnson once described the penthouse as her \u201ccastle in the sky,\u201d though living downtown was not the original plan. After buying Norwood Tower, the family intended to house its business operations there.\n\u201cHow can we ask other people to come downtown if we\u2019re living out in Westlake?\u201d Johnson recalled asking herself. That question ultimately drove the decision to renovate the top floors into a home.\nThat decision proved prescient as Austin\u2019s urban core took off. During her time there, Johnson said the building felt anything but lonely, serving as a hub for family offices, political gatherings, charitable events and personal milestones.\nNow living at the\nFour Seasons Residences\nalong Lady Bird Lake, Johnson said she hopes the next chapter for the Norwood Tower penthouse carries a similar civic-minded spirit.\n\u201cThese are challenging times for development in Austin,\u201d she said. \u201cBut whoever comes there, I hope they\u2019ll treasure being a chapter of Austin\u2019s history.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Nadim Ashi is closing on the buyout of a waterfront West Palm Beach condo building, securing a prime development site across from Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club.\nThe buyout of Harbor Towers, which sources say will total about $100 million, also marks a victory for Ashi over Steve Ross.\nThe\ntwo industry titans went head-to-head\nin a legal battle over control of the 2-acre, two-building, 61-unit complex at 3901 South Flagler Drive last year. With Ashi\u2019s Fort Partners poised to take control of the majority of units, Ross sued in April, demanding an injunction to block termination of the condo.\nAshi\u2019s attorney Glen Waldman described the legal maneuver as a standard block play, a natural byproduct of the intense competition for West Palm Beach\u2019s limited waterfront sites.\n\u201cEvery time you have big boys playing in the sandbox \u2026 they fight, and that\u2019s what they do,\u201d he said in an October interview. \u201cThey\u2019re not scared to fight.\u201d\nThe scrap seemed poised to get ugly in the fall, with Ashi\u2019s lawyers alleging underhanded tactics and seeking to depose Ross and his executives. The parties ultimately\nreached a settlement in October\n, allowing Ashi to move forward with his condo termination at Harbor Towers.\n\u201cThese owners were making so much money,\u201d Waldman said of the payout for unit owners. \u201cThere are no losers here.\u201d\nWaldman declined to comment on the final closings for this story, but Douglas Elliman agent Jessica Julian confirmed the buyout is a boon for sellers. She would know \u2013\u2013 she was among the unit owners to sell to Fort Partners. She also helped cut the deals between the developer and the rest of her neighbors, something that landed her in Related Ross\u2019 lawsuit last year.\nShe declined to comment on the total sellout price, but said the average price per unit worked out to about $1.4 million.\n\u201cI told my neighbors, \u2018Don\u2019t look a gift horse in the mouth,\u2019\u201d she said, describing early days courting Harbor Towers owners.\nJulian described a first wave of eager sellers who \u201cwanted to take the money and run,\u201d followed by months of angst and hostility between neighbors and the two bidding developers.\n\u201cWe were in a little bit of a war zone,\u201d she said.\nWith the last units closing, Ashi now controls the contiguous waterfront sites at 3901 South Flagler Drive, 3906 Washington Road and 3907 South Flagler Drive. He paid $20 million for the other two properties in November, records show.\nWhile Ashi won out at Harbor Towers, he lost to Steve Ross\u2019 bid for the neighboring Southbridge condos at 3915 South Flagler Drive. The billionaire Related Ross chairman closed on\na $25.4 million bulk buy of units\nin the building earlier this month. It marked a major payday for investor Joey Columbo who quietly bought up 43 percent of the units in the years prior, anticipating that a developer would come knocking.\nAlso this month, Gilbert Benhamou\u2019s\nImmocorp Capital offered $202 million\nto buy out the 140-unit South Portofino Condominium, which is adjacent to Harbor Towers.\nJulian said she\u2019s getting a lot of calls from developers interested in buying aging buildings.\nBut she\u2019s also starting to see hesitation from some developers concerned about prices and market saturation. If unit owners are interested in selling in this current wave of investment, she said, \u201cThey might want to be a bit more reasonable [with prices].\u201d",

        "content": "Hilton &amp; Hyland Chair\nLori Hyland\nturned the page in 2025 with a new office and, more recently, a fresh face to serve as the Beverly Hills firm\u2019s broker manager,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nThe appointment of Felix Pena, who has been with\nHilton &amp; Hyland\nfor over 20 years, comes after former managing director\nSteve Katz\nquietly exited the brokerage after a little over a year in the position.\nHyland called Pena, who is also a non-practicing attorney, an \u201cexceptional broker\u201d who knows Hilton &amp; Hyland \u201cvery well.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re very, very fond of Steve and we wish him the best,\u201d Hyland told\nTRD\non Tuesday. \u201cHe was a wonderful presence.\u201d\nKatz did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\nHyland said Katz officially left the brokerage about a month ago. State Department of Real Estate records show a Jan. 30 end to his time as broker associate with the company and no move of his license to a new firm.\nKatz joined Hilton &amp; Hyland in December 2024 during a time of transition within its executive ranks. About a week before Katz was announced as the brokerage\u2019s new managing director, Hilton &amp; Hyland saw former President\nDavid Kramer\n, along with his six-person team, decamp to Compass\u2019 Beverly Hills office. Kramer\u2019s group, with $1.7 billion in career sales, left to focus on sales.\nAt the time of Katz\u2019s appointment, Hilton &amp; Hyland said the executive would work with Hyland and former General Counsel Chrystal Ferber as a trio managing the firm\u2019s day-to-day operations and overseeing business strategy.\nFerber, who left the brokerage last April, called Katz\u2019s appointment \u201cnot just an appointment \u2013 it\u2019s a statement.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the brokerage has continued to see agent departures. Hyland confirmed the firm\u2019s headcount currently sits at around 25, which is a significant cut from the over 100 agents and staff that made up the roster in 2018 when the company moved into its now former office at 257 North Canon Drive in Beverly Hills.\nThere was also last year\u2019s tussle with Hilton &amp; Hyland\u2019s former\nlandlord\n, Standard Oil Investment Group. The property owner\nsued the brokerage\nfor more than $650,000 in unpaid rent on the Canon Drive space in a lawsuit that appears to be winding down. The landlord asked a judge to approve a request for the case\u2019s dismissal in November. Meanwhile, the end of 2025 saw Hilton &amp; Hyland leave the Standard Oil Building for a smaller footprint at 345 North Maple Drive, which Hyland told\nTRD\nat the time had nothing to do with the rent dispute.\nDespite the downsized office space, Hyland said they\u2019re interviewing agents.\n\u201cAnybody that has a good reputation, good track record and has a good portfolio of properties, we welcome,\u201d she said.\nHyland is the wife of the late Hilton &amp; Hyland co-founder Jeff Hyland, who started the company with Rick Hilton in 1993.\nEven with changes at the brokerage and what some might call a rugged stretch for the business, Lori Hyland said she and, now Pena, are committed to continuing on with the business.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been associated with this for all my life being Jeff\u2019s wife,\u201d Hyland said. \u201cHe founded it some 30 years ago, so we just want to continue to do business. Hilton &amp; Hyland is associated with luxury real estate, and this is what we want to continue doing.\u201d\n",

        "content": "For nearly a decade, Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s Upper East Side townhouse was one of the most closely guarded homes in New York.\nNewly released Justice Department documents show how Epstein tightly controlled access to the sprawling, off-market mansion, demanding buyer names, rejecting offers he deemed too low and expressing suspicion of ulterior motives. Locked out of one of the city\u2019s most notorious properties, agents dangled the names of billionaires, oligarchs and financiers in hopes of securing a showing. The bar for who was granted access to the townhouse \u2014 later revealed to be the site of much of Epstein\u2019s abuse of young women \u2014 was not just high, but often arbitrary, shaped as much by Epstein\u2019s ego as by any realistic prospect of a sale.\nBrokers paraded a procession of ultra-wealthy would-be buyers in an effort to unlock the front door, to little avail. Even Ben Ashkenazy, the billionaire developer behind a roughly $10 billion portfolio, was dismissed as \u201cnot rich enough.\u201d Others tried name-dropping foreign oligarchs \u2014 including one pitch promising \u201cmy very wealthy Russians.\u201d And when hedge funder and Mets owner Steve Cohen surfaced in broker paperwork, Epstein responded not with a showing, but by suggesting a \u201csting.\u201d\n\u2018My very wealthy Russians\u2019\nThe correspondence captures a strange audition process, as brokers cycled through names and pitches while Epstein and his aides decided who was worth letting inside.\nIn 2016, when Jed Garfield, who runs the boutique brokerage Leslie Garfield, approached an associate of Epstein\u2019s about showing the home at 9 East 71st Street to Ashkenazy, Epstein\nwrote\nback: \u201ctell jed [sorry] not rich enough.\u201d\nEpstein also appears to have turned down Michael Lehrman, who heads up Newmark\u2019s European group, and former Stephens CEO and current Ambassador to the United Kingdom Warren Stephens, emails show.\n\u201cMr Epstein can only assume the buyers are mere tire kickers,\u201d Epstein\u2019s assistant wrote to Garfield when he tried to bring Stephens by in 2010. \u201cYour previous clients never bid, so we are kind of wary.\u201d\nIn rare instances, Epstein allowed Garfield to show the home to some of his wealthy clients. In 2014 Garfield arranged a showing for one of the \u201cCandy brothers,\u201d presumably referring to real estate tycoons Nick and Christian Candy, and in 2015 for Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui, also known as Miles Kwok, who was later arrested in the United States for tax fraud.\nA spokesperson for Nick Candy confirmed that he toured the house in 2014, but the visit \u201cdid not result in any relationship, business dealings, or subsequent contact of any kind.\u201d\nAgents rarely communicated with Epstein directly, instead liaising with his cadre of advisors and assistants who relayed his thoughts on potential buyers and showings. Epstein also issued specific instructions for readying the house ahead of showings, including taking down photographs on the third floor \u2014 later identified by a New York Times\ninvestigation\nas the location of his bedroom and massage room, which were filled with images of naked women.\n\u201cJE just informed me [that] Jed Garfield will be showing 71st to someone on Friday at 11am\u2026Can we please make sure that the photos on 3rd floor are taken down as well,\u201d read an\nemail\nrelated to a showing in December 2011, where the sender is redacted.\nGarfield declined to comment on the emails.\nOther agents tried to get in on the action as well. In 2010, Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Serena Boardman emailed an Epstein\u2019s assistant claiming to have \u201ctwo good prospects,\u201d presumably referring to buyers for his townhouse. Epstein responded to his assistant, \u201cno interest.\u201d\nBoardman did not respond to requests for comment.\nIn some cases, brokers tried to bypass the process by leaning on name recognition. In 2016, Douglas Elliman\u2019s Richard Steinberg emailed Epstein\u2019s accountant with a \u201clongshot\u201d proposal of showing the home to two separate Russian oligarchs, Abramovich and Alexi Kuzmichev.\n\u201cWould Mr. Epstein consider showing two of my very wealthy Russians who I have sold two of the most expensive townhouses in New York to his home,\u201d Steinberg\nwrote\n.\nBut eight years later, Steinberg said those names were likely no more than a ploy to get in the door.\n\u201cI wanted to give myself credibility, because I imagined he would have gotten calls from 100 brokers trying to get access into the house,\u201d Steinberg told\nTRD\n.\n\u201cThey never looked at it, they were never interested,\u201d he said of the Russians.\n\u2018Let\u2019s set up a sting\u2019\nOne peculiar interaction revolved around yet another billionaire put forward as a potential buyer: Steve Cohen.\nA\ndocument\ndated May 5, 2010 shows \u201cSteven A. Cohen\u201d as a prospective buyer in a right-to-sell agreement sent to Epstein by Brown Harris Stevens. The document, which doesn\u2019t show a countersignature from Epstein, allowed BHS agent Brian Manning to show the property to Cohen through June 2010.\nNearly everybody involved in the emails around a potential showing for Cohen denied that he was interested in the property.\n\u201cAt no point did Steve or any authorized representative visit the property or express interest in purchasing it,\u201d a spokesperson for Cohen said in a statement.\nHall Wilkie, who was president of Brown Harris Stevens at the time and whose name appeared at the bottom of the document, said he never knew that Cohen was a potential buyer of Epstein\u2019s townhouse, and that he never personally toured the house. But Willkie\u2019s signature appears on a previous right-to-sell agreement for the property sent on April 30, 2010 that does not reveal Cohen\u2019s identity.\nEpstein did not appear to believe Cohen was a real buyer. \u201cHave Brian manning [confirm] in writing that his buyer that he represents is steve cohen,\u201d Epstein wrote to his accountant, Richard Kahn, the morning of May 5.\nEpstein went so far as to suggest that the tour was a ploy for \u201ceither thieves or investigators trying to get into the house\u201d in another email copying Kahn that day. When Kahn asked if he should schedule a viewing of the home if Manning did confirm Cohen\u2019s identity, Epstein\nreplied\n\u201cno, lets set up a sting.\u201d He didn\u2019t provide any other details on what a sting would entail.\nA house not for sale\nEpstein never sold the property while he was alive, likely because he sought eye-popping prices upward of $150 million, according to emails and interviews with agents familiar with the discussions. It was not until his death in 2019 \u2014 and as the full scope of his abuse became public \u2014 that the estate listed the home for $88 million with the Modlin Group\u2019s Adam Modlin. The mansion ultimately sold for $51 million in 2021 to financier Michael Daffey, after the asking price was cut to $65 million.\nEpstein, who died by suicide 2019 while awaiting his trial on sex trafficking charges, appeared to take over home in the mid-1990s from his longtime friend and mentor, Les Wexner.\nWho Epstein approved to see the home and what offers he would contemplate seemed to be an ever-changing threshold. In 2016, when Steinberg suggested showing Abramovich and Kuzmichev the home for $150 million, Epstein told his accountant: \u201c[Tell] him that roman already saw the house and i have turned down 250 m.\u201d\nEpstein repeated similar claims throughout the years.\nIn 2012, James Meiskin, at the time the head of real estate advisory firm Plymouth Partners, told Epstein\u2019s assistant that Russian financier Andrei Vavilov could write a check \u201cfor $100 million or so\u201d for the house. Epstein\nresponded\nby saying, \u201ci have already turned down three bids in the TWO hundreds.\u201d\nThe next year, Epstein had Garfield\nrelay\nto Nick Candy that he had \u201cturned down 240m.\u201d And in 2015, Garfield arranged a showing for Guo Wengui after offering to \u201cshow him the house at 250 million.\u201d Although Garfield later hinted Candy might consider bidding, Candy never made an offer on the property, according to his spokesperson.\nBut in 2009, Epstein quoted Garfield a price of $120 million for a showing, half of what he was asking just a few years later. Agents who had shown Epstein\u2019s home said there was no chance he had received offers over $200 million.\n\u201cThat is probably, absolutely BS,\u201d one agent said in response to questions about offers of that size. \u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d said another.\nMultiple sources confirmed that Epstein did receive an offer for roughly $125 million around 2010, which he turned down.\n\u201cWith Epstein, it was always a higher number,\u201d said one of the brokers familiar with the offer. The broker said Epstein shot back a counter around $175 million, which made it \u201cpretty clear he wasn\u2019t a seller. It was already an above-market transaction by any stretch of the imagination.\u201d\nDespite Epstein\u2019s apparent aversion to selling, other emails show a fixation on the Upper East Side townhouse market.\nEpstein\u2019s associates sent him articles from\nTRD\n, Curbed NY and other local outlets about townhouses in the area, including a story on art heir David Wildenstein selling his townhouse for a then-record $79.5 million in 2017 and a $48 million townhouse listing in 2012. In 2014, one of Boardman\u2019s team members put together a list of off-market townhouses for Epstein\u2019s review.\nEpstein also appeared to be particularly interested in Cohen\u2019s real estate dealings. In 2017, Kahn\nsent\nEpstein a\nTRD\narticle about Cohen\ncutting the price of his One Beacon Court\napartment by 50 percent.\nIn 2019, just five months before Epstein\u2019s arrest, Kahn shared another article about Cohen again cutting the price.\n\u201cWaited too long,\u201d Epstein\nresponded\n.\n",

        "content": "A nearly century-old office building near Millennium Park is the latest Chicago Loop property angling for a second act.\nThe 17-story building at 70 East Lake Street is up for sale, with Cushman &amp; Wakefield marketing the 1927 building as a candidate for apartments or a hotel conversion, according to offering materials. CoStar first\nreported\nthat the property, designed with gothic revival and art deco influences, is about 63 percent leased as offices.\nBrokers Kelsey Berry, Cody Hundertmark, Dirk Riekse and Tom Sitz are pitching the deal as a chance to buy the property for roughly $10 million to $12 million and reposition it, according to a person familiar with the offering. All but two of the existing leases include landlord termination rights, giving a buyer a relatively clear path to vacate the building and start over.\nThe seller, a family office represented locally by Chicago-based\nAnsonia Properties\n, has owned the tower since 1993, when it paid $3.1 million for the property, according to Cook County records. The building was last financed with a $6 million loan in 2017.\nThe offering adds to a growing pile of aging,\nhalf-empty office buildings\nin downtown Chicago being shopped for their conversion potential, as demand for workspace remains historically weak. Investors are increasingly hunting for low bases and flexible tenancy that make the math work for residential or hospitality reuse, according to the publication.\nThe Lake Street address sits in the heart of the Loop\u2019s tourism corridor, surrounded by North Michigan Avenue retail and some of the city\u2019s largest hotels. Next door is the teal\n\u201cRolls-Royce Garage\u201d\nat 60 East Lake Street, the Stanley Tigerman-designed parking structure that traded last year to Toronto-based Clermont for just under $12.4 million. A few feet away, the original Virgin Hotels outpost is being redeveloped into a\nSports Illustrated-branded timeshare\nresort.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The proposal includes a public parking garage for local businesses as well as a separate garage for residents. The city is also considering two other applications: one from\nAlliant Communities\nand another from a joint venture of\nRelated California\nand Alta Housing.\nMenlo Park officials will hold an open house for residents and local business owners to view displays of all the proposals and see presentations about the projects at a city council meeting in March. The city is expected to choose a proposal in April or May.\nAside from Presidio Bay\u2019s downtown endeavor, locals have been opposed to the City of Menlo Park\u2019s efforts to add housing in downtown Menlo Park due to a loss of parking.\nPresidio Bay\u2019s 670-unit project at 345 Middlefield Road would redevelop a 17-acre site occupied by 16 buildings, currently including a 20,000-square-foot laboratory facility once home to a U.S. Geological Survey office and the GeoKids child care center. Presidio Bay purchased the building from the General Services Administration\nlast year for $137 million\n. Plans call for three apartment buildings, four office buildings, 40,000 square feet of ground-floor retail, a new child care center and a dog park.\nPresidio Bay has already broken into the Menlo Park market.

Funds managed by\nFortress Investment Group\noriginated and arranged the debt.\nJasper was built in 2023 and rises seven stories above South Grand Avenue. The Fortress loan will help bolster ongoing leasing efforts at the property and refinance roughly $80 million in construction debt provided by Acore Capital in 2023. Fortress opted to provide the Jasper financing as the lender looks to support \u201chigh-quality, newly built multifamily housing backed by an experienced sponsor with significant equity invested.\u201d\nMultifamily occupancy in the downtown Los Angeles area has remained strong while office vacancies and\ndistress\nsince the pandemic have continued to pose problems. Last year, multifamily occupancy reached nearly 91 percent, surpassing pre-pandemic levels, per Lee &amp; Associates data cited by CO.\nJamison is among those firms that have attracted lender interest in its downtown housing projects. Last month, the Koreatown-based company\nsecured a $195 million construction loan\ntied to the former Arco tower at 1055 West Seventh Street. Jamison is slated to convert the 33-story, roughly 620,000-square-foot office building into 686 residential units, making it the largest adaptive reuse project in Los Angeles history, according to CO. Construction on that project began earlier this year.\nCityview is working on an adaptive reuse plan of its own. The developer is\nplanning to redevelop\nthe two-building Newport summit office complex in Irvine into 422 units of housing.

The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat the 246,955-square-foot building, formerly known as the Atlas Energy Tower, will be rebranded 12001 NCX.

Built in 1984, the tower is known for its prominent signage along the Central Expressway corridor.\nDallas-based Gutow is buying into a market still sorting through office distress. In December, Denver-based Real Capital Solutions paid $26.1 million for the nearby 18-story\nWalnut Glen\nbuilding, a roughly 64 percent haircut from its $73 million sale price in 2016.\nAt 12001 NCX, Gutow sees upside, as the building is about 50 percent leased, with 15,000 square feet of new leases recently signed and additional deals in negotiation, founder Craig Gutow said in a statement. He pointed to leasing momentum, capital improvements and \u201chands-on ownership\u201d as the path to value creation, according to the outlet.\nThe firm plans to upgrade common areas, refresh amenities and offer fully built-out, move-in ready suites, aiming to attract smaller tenants seeking turnkey space without the upfront construction costs.\nFounded in 2003, Gutow owns office and apartment properties across North Texas, including another building nearby at 9900\nNorth Central Expressway\n.\nDemand in the area is picking up, as Alabama-based insurance brokerage CRC Group announced in January that the firm is consolidating its four Dallas-Fort Worth offices into a single 49,000-square-foot hub at the Lakeside Square office in North Dallas, also within the U.S. 75 and I-635 corridor.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Related Ross is expected to pay $31 million for the eastern portion, while ElevateEd will pay $16 million for the western side, the Town-Crier\nreported\n.\nRelated Ross would build 15 residential units on top of retail as part of phase one, and 200 residential units in phase two, per a village staff report.\nWellington approved construction but delayed a vote to allow ElevateEd to operate a pre-K-12 school, called Wingrove Academy, for 1,750 students, giving the private school operator time to clarify how many scholarships will be reserved for students who live in the village.\nThe developers said last summer they intended to open Wingrove Academy in Wellington\nby 2028\n. It would be the first school in the U.S. for ElevateEd, a company headed by Singapore-based Education In Motion co-founder Karen Yung and business consultant Marianne Rehn.\nWellington, known for its polo fields and farms, has attracted increased attention from developers.\nDeveloper Mark Bellissimo got the green light in August to build the\nMarketplace at Wellington\n, which will include 80 hotel rooms, 89 condo units and 117,000 square feet of commercial space.\nArizona-based\nMeritage Homes\nis seeking zoning to build a 206-townhome complex on 30 acres in the village.\nAlso in Wellington, former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt and Discovery Land Company\nnarrowly won the council\u2019s initial approval\nto turn a former polo field into a polo-themed country club development with 40 single-family homes, though it\u2019s far from certain their plans will win final approval.",

Adjacent to the site, MG and New York-based Baron Property Group completed the pair of 10-story buildings with 559 apartments, combined, for their Metro Parc project.\nMG and Baron also are developing Metro Parc North with an\neight-story, 661-unit\nbuilding at 901 East 26th Street.\nMiami Lakes-based Prestige Companies has seized on Hialeah with projects including the three-story, 114-unit\nMarket Station North\ncomplex and a redevelopment of the Hialeah Park Racing &amp; Casino into\nFlamingo Village\n, with a 343-unit apartment complex and a charter school. The site is at 100 East 32nd Street.\nNear Hialeah, Adell Investments, led by Jorge and Julio Quintana, proposed last year the five-story, 108-unit\nHUB Palm Springs North\nbuilding at 17601 and 17775 Northwest 78th Avenue and 7750 Northwest 178th Street. The site is in unincorporated Miami-Dade County.\nDevelopers jumped on South Florida\u2019s pandemic-era multifamily boom, defined by unprecedented demand and record rent growth, with plans for new projects. Amid hefty completions in recent years, the influx of out-of-staters slowed, prompting\nslower leaseups\n, an increase in concessions and a drop in rents.\u00a0Yet, developers starting apartment projects now say demand will catch up by the time they finish their buildings partly due to a\ndrop in construction starts\n.\n",

        "content": "Now that a federal bankruptcy judge approved an intramural battle between lenders on Oceanwide Plaza, creditors are facing a decision: Make their own or joint credit bids and try to finish the project or sell it off in hopes of recouping sunk costs, a person with knowledge of the matter told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe decision is imminent, the source said.\nThe project is estimated to require another $1 billion or more to complete.\nThe bankruptcy exit agreement recently\nreached\nover downtown Los Angeles\u2019 problem project clears the way for a potential deal. The latest framework appears to offer the two major creditors an avenue to either bid the debt they\u2019re owed in exchange for the property or sell for cash.\nBloomberg previously reported a potential investor is negotiating to buy the property, and the deal hinged on resolving the bankruptcy.\nUnder the latest agreement, LA Downtown Investment, funded via EB-5 investors, is entitled to a $230-million claim, and Lendlease, the one-time general contractor on the project, is in line for another of about $169 million. Other creditors, including one tied to Lendlease, are also in line for claims, per recent filings.\nThe mixed-use, two-million square foot development that sits opposite Crypto.com Arena near the LA Live entertainment hub, has been stalled for years since developer China Oceanwide ran out of money after putting more than a billion dollars into vision of a mixed-use megaproject with office, retail, hotel and residential components. The Beijing-based developer, which has since been delisted from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2024. Earlier, when the development stalled, China Oceanwide said it would\nneed another\n$1 billion to complete construction.\nNow the bankrupt developer is looking to sell the bedraggled asset off by making a presumptuous pitch about the priorities of the City of Los Angeles and its residents.\n\u201c\u201cA prompt sale and eventual completion of the project is a major priority for the city and the public at large, particularly with the upcoming 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles,\u201d lawyers for Oceanwide Plaza said a court filing last month, calling it a \u201chigh-profile civic issue\u201d for the city.\nThe settlement reached among creditors basically put an end to the millions of dollars being spent on lawyers while lenders sued each other. It outlined who got what and at what interest rate.\n\u201cThe settlement agreement puts an immediate stop to this value-destructive litigation, preserving estate assets and allowing the debtor to pivot from endless legal battles to the productive work of selling the project and confirming a plan,\u201d lawyers wrote.\nRepresentatives for LADI, Lendlease and Oceanwide did not immediately respond to a request for comment\n",

Prosecutors claim that the landlords improperly withheld security deposits, imposed rent increases beyond legal limits and charged excessive late fees.\nThe Pirians routinely kept most or all of tenants\u2019 security deposits after they moved out, according to Feldstein Soto\u2019s office. When tenants took issue with the withheld deposits, the landlords allegedly ignored them or told the former renters they would have to go to court to get their money back. The landlords also included a provision in their leases that allowed them to charge late fees equal to 10 percent of the base rent \u2014 an unenforceable penalty under the law, per the complaint.\nIn the height of the pandemic in 2020, Los Angeles implemented tenant protections including an\neviction moratorium\nand\nlimits on rent increases\n. The brothers were allegedly aware that the rent hikes they imposed on tenants were illegal, though the defendants reportedly told renters who complained not to tell others that the increases broke the law, prosecutors claim.\nThe Pirians are also accused of failing to pay required interest on security deposits held for one year or longer, discriminating against tenants based on the method used to receive housing subsidies, unlawfully passing off city fees to tenants and failing to provide legally required contact information for property owners and managers.\nFeldstein Soto\u2019s office is looking to get a court order to stop the alleged illegal activities, secure restitution for affected tenants and impose civil penalties on the landlords.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

CBRE\u2019s John Jaeger and Tom Svoboda are marketing the development site, while Michael Wilson and Christian Williams are handling the retail listing.\nCarlins told the publication that a new partner would not alter\nMagellan\u2019s long-standing vision\nfor a high-rise on the Columbus Drive parcel, known as Parcel O. The site is zoned for up to 574 apartments, 239 hotel rooms and more than 10,000 square feet of retail. Magellan and Hanwha struck a deal last year to bring U.K.-based Hoxton to the project for what would be its second Chicago hotel.\nParcel O is one of the last remaining development sites within the 28-acre Lakeshore East campus, built on a former nine-hole golf course east of the Loop. Since 2002, the master-planned community has reshaped the skyline, most notably with Jeanne Gang\u2019s 82-story\nAqua tower\nand 101-story\nSt. Regis Chicago\n.\nThe zoning predates the city\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance update, mandating that 20 percent of units in new projects be set aside at below-market rents. Only 33 new parking spaces would be required, with up to 329 spaces available through an easement in Aqua, according to CBRE.\nThe retail portion, known as Village Market, is 89 percent leased and anchored by a multilevel Mariano\u2019s grocery store. Other tenants include Avli on the Park, Eggy\u2019s Diner, Gordo\u2019s Tiny Taco Bar and MingHin Cuisine. The space has a weighted average lease term of roughly 4.5 years.\nMagellan has monetized portions of Lakeshore East before, including a $190.5 million sale of Aqua\u2019s apartment component in 2019.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The property, which is listed for $8.5 million, hit the market on Feb. 4 and went into contract Feb. 6, according to listing sites. The home was one of last week\u2019s top residences to go into contract, based on asking price, according to the Eklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles.\nThe weekly roundup, compiled by Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team, counts Los Angeles County properties listed for $4 million or more in the Multiple Listing Service.\nProperty records show Danault and Fortin bought the home in 2022 for just under $6 million and lived there while Danault played for the Kings. He left the team last year and made a return to the Montreal Canadiens, where he played between 2016 and 2021.\nThe asking price on the South Bay home, located in the American Martyrs district of\nManhattan Beach\n\u2019s Tree Section, pencils out to $1,971 per square foot. The roughly 10-block American Martyrs area gets its name from its proximity to the American Martyrs Church and School and is known for sizable lots, including some with ocean views.\nVista Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s June Emerson holds the listing.\nThe five-bedroom, five-bathroom home spans 4,312 square feet. It touts ocean views, a wine cellar, elevator, Tesla charger and parking for five vehicles.\nWhile the\nManhattan Beach\nproperty is headed for what could be a fast closing, it didn\u2019t top last week\u2019s list of homes to go into contract.\nThat designation went to 722 North Camden Drive in the Beverly Hills Flats. The seven-bed, 10-bath home is listed for $21 million, or $1,835 per square foot.\nProperty records indicate Vandad Zarrin and Nahid Chapchian are the owners. Zarrin owns VZ Construction Co., which built the Mediterranean-inspired home last year.\nRevel Real Estate\u2019s Ben Bacal holds the listing.\nThe home sits on an expansive lot of more than 15,000 square feet. Highlights of the home include a nearly 2,000-square-foot primary suite with its own sitting room and balcony. There\u2019s also a driveway made with Italian marble and each bedroom has its own bathroom. Prospective buyers also had the option of buying the home\u2019s Restoration Hardware furnishings.\nThe Flats property was one of 19 homes to go into contract last week, according to the\nEklund Gomes\nreport. That was good for $114.9 million in asking volume, which was off about 35 percent from the year-ago period.\n",

Large windows overlook rolling pastureland. The property also includes a guest house, pool and pool house, a six-stall barn, indoor and outdoor riding arenas and a helicopter pad, according to the listing.

That\u2019s the greatest decline among the 50 biggest metro areas in the country, surpassing runner-up Washington, D.C., by more than a percentage point. However, absorption rates suggest that demand may consume enough supply to level out the Austin multifamily market by the end of the year.\nRents have been falling in Austin for nearly two years, after a\nmultifamily building spree\nchased the swiftly rising demand for apartment living during the early 2020s. Between 2021 and 2023, average rent in Austin\nrose by more than 30 percent\n. Austin multifamily construction\npeaked in 2024\n, but oversupply continues to depress rents and force landlords to offer concessions that tenants in 2021 couldn\u2019t dream of getting.\nOther primary metropolitan areas in Texas also saw rent declines last month. In San Antonio, already the cheapest place to rent of the top 50 cities nationwide, rent dipped 3 percent in January to $1,076 per month, a 3.2 percent year-over-year decline, CoStar reported. Rent decreased by 2.1 percent in Fort Worth to $1,258 in January. Dallas and Houston had the flattest declines in Texas in January, with average rent decreasing by 1.9 percent and 1.8 percent year-over-year, respectively.\nIt\u2019s not an issue of demand, according to Grant Montgomery, national director of multifamily analytics at CoStar.\n\u201cIn Texas, demand is quite strong. Many of those markets are actually leaders both on absolute absorption of units, as well as the percentage of absorption,\u201d Montgomery said.\nIn the last quarter of 2025, Austin absorbed over 3,100 units, the fifth-largest level of any market in the United States, according to CoStar. Measured as a percentage of its total supply, Austin\u2019s absorption last quarter ranked second in the country at 1 percent, trailing only Charlotte.\nIn light of sustained demand, month-over-month data suggests that rents may soon reach the bottom of the curve. After 19 straight months of decline, Austin posted a marginal increase in rents in January, compared to December. San Antonio, Dallas, Fort Worth and Houston saw similar month-over-month increases.\n\u201cOne data point does not a trend make. [But] this is the first time it has turned positive on a month-over-month basis,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cBy the end of the year, Austin might get back to breakeven on a year-over-year rent basis, which would be a large accomplishment given the headwinds that it\u2019s faced over the last couple of years.\u201d\n",

A filing with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation pegs the cost of its buildout at $5.6 million, with construction slated to run from January through June. TDLR filings are preliminary, but offer an early look at tenant investment.\nUBS manages roughly $6.6 trillion in assets globally and already has a presence in Dallas-Fort Worth, including offices at The Crescent, Plano and Fort Worth.\nPrivate equity firm Stonelake Capital Partners is also relocating from The Crescent to\n23Springs\n, leasing about 16,000 square feet on the ninth floor. A confidential tenant signed for 22,099 square feet on the 10th floor, with occupancy expected in the third quarter, according to the publication.\nThe leases are notable in an office market still grappling with elevated vacancy. Paul Bennett, Granite\u2019s senior managing director, told the outlet that the tower\u2019s momentum reflects demand for top-tier buildings in prime locations.

It is set to be completed this month.\nGranite broke ground after buying the Cedar Springs and Maple Avenue site in 2012 and demolishing existing structures in 2022. Bank OZK provided a\n$265 million construction loan\nfor the project. The building is jointly owned with Highwoods Properties, the North Carolina-based real estate investment trust that holds a 50 percent stake in 23Springs and Granite Park Six in Plano.\nOn the retail front, Australian-born restaurant Little Ruby\u2019s opened a freestanding restaurant at the project Feb. 2, joining \u00c9lephante and Torchy\u2019s Tacos.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "If your car\u2019s warning lights start flashing, do you take it in for repairs or keep driving until the brakes fail?\nLeila Bozorg keeps driving.\nBozorg, Mayor Zohran Mamdani\u2019s deputy mayor for housing, believes the state shouldn\u2019t amend 485x unless the crucial multifamily development law\nremains broken\nfor a while longer.\nHere\u2019s what\nThe City\nwrote last week:\nBozorg doesn\u2019t think the law needs any changes. \u201cIf you look at the history of 421a, there was slow uptake in early years and then it became a robust program that many used,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s too early to say that it has failed.\u201d\nPro-housing folks are optimistic about Bozorg. She just hired Andrew Fine from the YIMBY group Open New York as a senior adviser \u2014 one of several signs that she wants a lot more housing built. But her reasoning about the history of 421a needs a reality check.\nThe numbers simply don\u2019t tell the whole story of 421a, which preceded 485x as an essential tax break for developers to build mixed-income rental buildings in the city.\nThe last two times 421a expired, the state legislature made the new version less generous. So developers rushed to get their foundations in the ground before the expiration, then spent the next few years finishing the projects.\nOf course there was a pause before they embraced the new version.\nFirst, many developers didn\u2019t have the capacity to start a project with the new tax break while they still had holes in the ground under the old one.\nSecond, projects cannot compete on rents with simultaneous projects getting a more generous tax break. Projects that can\u2019t compete don\u2019t get built.\nFor the same reasons, 485x was destined to get off to a slow start, as Bozorg noted. Its terms are less generous than 421a\u2019s, and lots of 421a projects are under construction or soon to begin.\nBut the issues with 485x go beyond that. Its wage scale, which kicks in at 100 units and ramps up at 150, is\nshrinking\nprojects. That hasn\u2019t happened before. Developers\nwarned\nabout the\n99-unit problem\nas soon as 485x passed in 2024, and they have been proven right.\nProject filings show that developers are keeping projects\nunder 100 units\nto avoid the construction\nwage floor\nand the financial risks it presents.\nSome are splitting projects into two or three buildings, each with fewer than 100 units, but this is inefficient and raises costs \u2014 the opposite of what 485x is supposed to achieve.\nOther sites don\u2019t get developed at all because they can\u2019t accommodate two buildings and the economics don\u2019t work for a 99-unit project.\nLetting it fail for another two or three years is a bad idea. In a housing crisis rooted in a supply shortage, missing years of full production would be political malpractice. And there is no question that 485x is leaving thousands of units unbuilt.\nI don\u2019t mean to pin the blame on Bozorg. She works for Mamdani, who is aligned with construction unions just like his favorite villain Andrew Cuomo was. (As governor, Cuomo shut down 421a for 15 months at the behest of the unions before finally forcing them to make a deal.)\nBozorg believes developers will negotiate project-labor agreements with unions so they can do 485x projects without the high cost and risk of the wage floor. But that creates an obstacle for every 100-plus-unit project. Bozorg\u2019s job is to remove obstacles, not endorse them.\nThe city and state need to create a viable framework for developers to build as-of-right with as few bottlenecks as possible. Negotiating one PLA at a time is not the way to build our way out of the housing shortage.\nGary LaBarbera\nis the main reason lawmakers are hesitant to fix 485x. At one time, such projects didn\u2019t matter so much to the construction unions in his umbrella group, because they were busy enough building public infrastructure and Class A office towers. But things have changed.\nFirst, nonunion contractors learned how to build towers. And now infrastructure projects are stalling.\nDonald Trump \u2014 whom construction union members\nlargely voted for\n\u2014 is\nhalting infrastructure projects\nto get concessions from\nblue states\nor sanctuary cities, or because they are\nnot named after him\n. He also\nhates wind turbines\n.\nMeanwhile, not much office is going up.\nSo the unions want 100-plus-unit projects to themselves and will cling to the 485x wage scale even if it takes housing production down with it. State legislators and Gov. Kathy Hochul (all up for re-election) won\u2019t change the law this year, and Mamdani won\u2019t ask them to.\nHow many years will they wait?\n",

        "content": "Yay Yimby, nay bad landlords.\nOn Tuesday, back-to-back announcements delivered those two messages. The Mamdani administration released the dates for the five \u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings, and then appeared at a rally to celebrate Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s \u201cLet Them Build\u201d agenda, to support her proposal to reform the State Environmental Quality Review Act, or SEQRA.\nDuring the press conference, Mamdani lamented the years that environmental review can tack onto a project\u2019s timeline.\n\u201cTwo years just to get through the environmental review on the project,\u201d Mamdani said. \u201cAfter that, you don\u2019t even get to start building. That\u2019s just when the actual approval process can begin.\u201d\nHe went on to say that the governor\u2019s proposal \u2014\u00a0which would exempt certain housing projects of up to 500 units from environmental review \u2014\u00a0will allow the city to build more housing, which will drive down rents.\nWhile this was a welcome message for housing developers, property owners were reeling from another from the mayor.\nJust before this press conference, the mayor\nposted\na flyer on X that some have compared to a boxing match poster because of its declaration of the main attraction of the \u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings: \u201cNew Yorkers vs. Bad Landlords!\u201d\nNew York Apartment Association\u2019s Kenny Burgos, who\ncomplimented\nthe mayor\u2019s comments about housing development, said the hearings will be \u201call show and no substance.\u201d\n\u201cI think we are all exhausted of elected officials that are more focused on splashy events instead of actually making people\u2019s lives better,\u201d he said in a statement.\nThe dual announcements encapsulate the convergence of pro-housing development and pro-tenant policies.\nIn general, Yimby groups have increasingly\nincorporated\nmore pro-tenant policies into their legislative priorities. (Open New York supported 485x but also good cause eviction, for\u00a0instance, in 2024.)\nDoing so has perhaps helped make messaging around housing reform more palatable to those on the left. Over the last few years we\u2019ve seen progressive New York electeds support ramping up housing construction as the solution to the city\u2019s shortage, embracing a pro-development message without coming across as pro-developer, per se. Tuesday\u2019s rally showed that the trend has reached new heights. A Democratic Socialist provided full-throated support for a proposal aimed at quashing a key weapon against housing development in New York: Lawsuits seeking to undo rezonings or nullify project approvals based on allegations that the accompanying environmental review was illegitimate.\nWednesday\u2019s rally also showed the growing influence of pro-development groups like Open New York. Executive Director Annemarie Gray, who was the only speaker aside from Mamdani and Hochul, said SEQRA has been weaponized by wealthy Nimbys.\nReal estate often gets lumped into one big-bad villain, sometimes taking down with it policies that would benefit the greater pro-housing movement. The fact that SEQRA has such momentum signals a shift in that thinking when it comes to housing development. For property managers and owners, the conversation isn\u2019t centered on making their jobs easier, but cracking down on bad actors in their midst.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: Wednesday was \u201ctin cup\u201d day in Albany. During an hours-long back and forth with state lawmakers, Mayor Zohran Mamdani gave two anecdotes about speaking to a millionaire New Yorker and meeting with a real estate leader. In the first, he said he spoke to a millionaire who claimed he would leave NYC if his taxes were raised. Mamdani said that when he told this person that the tax hike he is seeking is 2 percent \u2014 $20,000 for someone earning $1 million a year \u2014 the high-earner acknowledged that he would not leave.\nMamdani also said he met with a real estate leader who told him that much of the value of his company hinges on the work of City Hall. Who was the mystery millionaire and real estate leader? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Jonathan Miller, an appraiser reporters have on speed dial, will\nno longer\nauthor reports for Douglas Elliman after 32 years. He announced Wednesday that he and the brokerage are parting ways.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026.\n\u2014\u00a0During a joint legislative budget hearing on Wednesday, Sherif Soliman, director of the mayor\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, indicated that the administration is working on a bill to present to the state to reform the city\u2019s property tax system. Soliman said the proposal would build on the recommendations laid out in the 2021 report by the city\u2019s Advisory Commission on Property Tax Reform, on which he served as executive director. One such recommendation would be to eliminate assessed value growth caps.\nLast year\n, Mayor Eric Adams similarly told lawmakers that the city was working on a proposal to reform the city\u2019s property tax system.\n\u2014\u00a0Mamdani also provided an updated estimate of the city\u2019s budget deficit for the next two years. It\u2019s $7 billion instead of the initially announced $12 billion. The mayor said the projection adjustment was made after taking into account Wall Street bonuses and income tax revenues. The change, however, did not change the mayor\u2019s mind about raising taxes on the city\u2019s wealthiest and on corporations.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$24.8 million\nfor a 3,364-square-foot condominium unit at 15 Central Park West on the Upper West Side. Cathy Franklin, Alexis Bodenheimer and Shannon Suydam with Corcoran\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$24.1 million\nfor a 30,000-square-foot, 30- unit apartment building at 335 Carroll Street in Carroll Gardens. Mack Real Estate sold the property to GDC Properties.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$25 million\nfor a 2,156-square-foot, single-family house at 18 East 62nd Street in Lenox Hill. Abraham Sarway with Douglas Elliman has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 43,085-square-foot, nine-story, 56-unit residential project at 11 Cornelia Street in Bushwick. Nikolai Katz filed the permit on behalf of Shimon Greenfeld of SCG Capital.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

The couple may be buying somewhere else on the island, but sources could not confirm where.\nThe Wall Street Journal broke news of\nthe purported contract\nfor 2 Indian Creek Island Road Monday evening. The purchase was said to be costing the Facebook founder between $150 million and $200 million and indicated that the longtime Palo Alto residents were ducking the Golden State ahead of its proposed 5 percent wealth tax.\nThe Cancros are not selling their home, according to broker Rena Kliot, who represented them in the purchase of the property in 2021.\nZuckerberg\u2019s possible purchase and relocation became the story of the week online and off. Many in the Miami real estate community touted it as proof of the Sunshine State\u2019s ascendancy and California\u2019s shortsighted policymaking.\nFlorida, and Miami in particular, has benefited from a significant wealth migration in recent years, including many tech billionaires. Jeff Bezos spent\n$234 million\non a trio of properties on Indian Creek Island, famously dubbed \u201cBillionaire\u2019s Bunker.\u201d There is speculation he bought a fourth 1.8 acre estate for\n$105 million\nin June.\nMore recently, Google co-founder Larry Page\ndropped $173 million\non a pair of waterfront Coconut Grove estates, and his co-founder Sergey Brin is reportedly buying the Allison Island home of LVMH Americas Chairman &amp; CEO Michael Burke.\nEven if Zuckerberg and Chan aren\u2019t buying 2 Indian Creek Road, they could be picking up another home on the private island, sources said.\nThere is only one Indian Creek estate currently on the Multiple Listing Service, cosmetic surgeon Dr. Aaron Rollins\u2019 spec mansion at 7 Indian Creek Island Road\nasking $200 million\n. Rollins\u2019 wife Marine Rollins, a real estate agent, did not respond to a request for comment about whether her home was the one that sold.\nBut many of the largest deals happen off-market.\n\u201cThere are several owners who have been quoting me these \u2018make-me-move\u2019 prices, ranging from $175 million on the lower end to upwards of $275 million,\u201d Joel Lusky of the Brokerage South Florida said.\nSources say football superstar Tom Brady\u2019s newly completed estate at 26 Indian Creek Island Road is quietly for sale in that price range.",

The 1.55-acre project site at 20955 Biscayne Boulevard is just south of the Broward County line, between\nAventura Mall\nand the Village at Gulfstream Park shopping center in Hallandale Beach.\nThe nine-story building will span 142,000 square feet, including 63,400 square feet of office. The rest is slated for retail, restaurant and fitness center uses. Jaxi Builders is the general contractor, and the development is already under construction.\nAventura paid $13 million for the property in 2020, acquiring it from a funeral service provider. The developer first submitted plans for the site in 2021, later revising them before moving forward.\nThe project adds new office and storefront space along a busy stretch of Biscayne Boulevard, in one of Northeast Miami-Dade\u2019s most active commercial corridors.\nThe retail vacancy rate in Miami-Dade County dropped to 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Colliers. That plus a slowing development pipeline has created demand for investors.\nThe biggest retail sale in the fourth quarter was Aventura Mall owners Turnberry Associates and Simon Property Group\u2019s\n$131 million purchase\nof the former Esplanade Aventura shopping center, at 19505 Biscayne Boulevard, which has been rebranded the Abbey at Aventura.\nRetail development hit a post-pandemic peak in South Florida last year, when construction completions outpaced starts. About 765,500 square feet of retail space is under construction in the fourth quarter across Miami-Dade, according to Colliers.\nMeanwhile, Aventura has a low office vacancy rate compared to the rest of the country, at 8.7 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Savill\u2019s. Office space is less expensive in the suburb, at an average of $54.35 per square foot, compared to averages of over $110 per square foot in Miami Beach and almost $89 per square foot in Brickell.\n\u2014 Rachel Stone",

        "content": "Graham Companies pitched plans for a 541-unit apartment complex in Miami Lakes, in a proposal that hasn\u2019t received full-throated endorsement from locals.\nThe family firm, which developed Miami Lakes and is a major landlord in the town, wants to build the complex on a site previously slated for a \u201csenior village\u201d and an assisted living facility.\nThe 22.2-acre lakefront development site is at Oak Lane and Commerce Way in Miami Lakes. Graham owns the property, records show.\nThe Town of Miami Lakes Planning and Zoning Board deferred voting Tuesday on a requested future land use map amendment and rezoning necessary for the project. The board will take up the items on March 10.\nThe proposal marks the latest iteration for a project on the site. Graham worked on a plan in 2010 for a senior village with age-restricted apartments and an assisted living facility with skilled nursing. That project fizzled out when\nMiami Jewish Health\n, a nonprofit with health care facilities for the elderly in South Florida, backed out of the partnership in 2019. Another health care partner eventually also opted out of collaborating.\nThe firm previously discontinued construction of an office building on a portion of the site after the pandemic unraveled the market, partly due to remote work.\nGraham president Luis Martinez framed its recent proposal as Graham putting Miami Lakes\u2019 needs first, avoiding over-development. The project would consist of three-story buildings fronting Commerce Way, and four- and five-story buildings on the rest of the site. Graham would contribute $1.3 million toward a town senior center.\nAlthough the firm could use the Live Local Act, which allows for high densities and heights as a way to incentivize affordable housing, Graham has no experience operating below market rentals and pointed out the law allows for property tax abatements, he told the board. Under Live Local, all units designated for households earning up to 80 percent of the area median income get a 100 percent tax break, and all units for households earning up to 120 percent of the AMI get a 75 percent break.\nThis \u201ccan hurt\u201d a municipality that has to collect taxes to continue \u201cthriving,\u201d Martinez told the board. If density is maximized, it would allow for 978 units, he said.\n\u201cWe sincerely wish we had been able to create the senior village. Unfortunately, we just could not make it happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThe two paths available are Live Local or the applications in front of you today.\u201d\nSome residents still weren\u2019t persuaded by Martinez\u2019s presentation.\n\u201cEverybody is furious \u2026\u00a0 because they already are overwhelmed with the traffic in this town,\u201d said Bonnie Cintron, adding that the site previously was rezoned for the senior village under the promise that zoning would revert back to industrial if the project fizzled. \u201cMaybe it was a boldfaced lie. I don\u2019t know. It seems to be.\u201d\nGraham traces its roots to milk, bottling and distribution company Graham Dairy, started in 1932 by the late Ernest R. Graham. His descendants have expanded the firm into real estate, including the development of the 3,000-acre master-planned Miami Lakes, according to Graham Companies\u2019 website. Prominent family members include the late Phil Graham, who was publisher and co-owner of The Washington Post, and the late Bob Graham, a politician.\nThe company is now led by CEO Stuart S. Wyllie.\nGraham also plans a\n220-unit\napartment complex on a site near its recently proposed project. In 2024, it paid\n$69 million\nfor the ground lease for the 448-unit Courtyards at Miami Lakes at 6431 Cow Pen Road in Miami Lakes.\n",

        "content": "The famous Casa Encantada estate in Bel Air is back on the market for nearly $100 million below its initial listing price as it remains at the center of an ongoing legal dispute.\nCasa Encantada at 10644 Bellagio Road is now for sale for $170 million, down from $190 million last year, the New York Post\nreported\n. The property\nlisted in 2023 for $250 million\nafter first\ngoing up for sale in 2019 for $225 million\n.\nThe home belonged to late telecommunications billionaire Gary Winnick, who purchased the estate in 2000 for a record $94 million. Since his death in 2023,\nhis widow Karen Winnick\nhas been fighting to keep the home as lender CIM Real Estate Credit LLC looks to foreclose on the property. CIM originated a loan in 2020 secured against the estate, and the debt has increased beyond $150 million.\nA foreclosure auction was scheduled for December 2025 but the home has still not sold and remains on the market. \u201cAt Karen Winnick\u2019s request, the California Court of Appeal granted a temporary stay of the foreclosure on Dec. 16, 2025. That temporary stay continues to be in effect as of now,\u201d a lawyer for Winnick told the Post.\nWinnick and\nher son\nAlexander claim they were left \u201ceffectively destitute\u201d by an alleged loan-to-own scheme against the mansion and other assets. Karen was reportedly unaware of the terms of the loan.\nCIM\n\u2019s recent filings in Los Angeles Super Court call for moving the legal dispute out of California, claiming the fight should be in New York due to unspecified provisions in the 2020 loan agreement and a personal guarantee signed by Karen Winnick. The lender argues that she personally signed the guarantee and later executed multiple amendments and advance requests tied to the debt. CIM believes Winnick\u2019s connection to these documents disproves the idea that she was unaware of the debt structure.\nCasa Encantada\n\u2019s 28,725-square-foot main residence consists of seven bedrooms and 20 bathrooms. The estate has been home to billionaires in the past, including Conrad Hilton and David Murdock. The property also features a walnut-paneled library, hand-lacquered dining room walls, two formal salons and a bar for guests. Outside, rose gardens, orchards and rolling lawns surround the manse with a 60-foot tiled pool and a tennis pavilion.\nCourt hearings regarding the loan dispute are scheduled throughout the spring, including debates over whether the case should remain in Los Angeles and whether key claims can survive at all. A breach-of-contract lawsuit has also been initiated in New York.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Winnetka Park District officials are considering scrapping an agreement with billionaire Justin Ishbia for a $3 million donation for park improvements after an outcry from residents over design plans.\nThe\nWinnetka Park Board\n, a separate body from the village government, last week approved a scaled-back version of a plan to install fencing on Centennial Park beach for an off-leash dog beach. Residents and village zoning officials had questioned the initial fence plans.\nThe new proposal violates the terms of a $3 million donation agreement reached in 2024 with the Ishbia Family Foundation. Commissioners also voted to revisit that agreement and potentially terminate it once they receive permits for the new plan. Ishbia, a founding partner of Shore Capital Partners and co-owner of the Phoenix Suns, is building a megamansion on his property directly south of the park.\nThe controversy is the latest in a\nstring of feuds\nspurred by Ishbia\u2019s goals for his 68,000-square-foot mansion spanning three lakefront lots. Ishbia, whose wealth Forbes pegs at $5.8 billion, has been engaged in controversial back-and-forth with the village and residents over privacy barriers at his property and a proposed land swap that would have extended his property into part of Centennial Park.\nA spokesperson for Ishbia said he declined to comment. The Winnetka Park District did not return a request for comment.\nThe\n$3 million Ishiba donation\nis contingent on a number of improvements, including a fenced-off dog beach at the border between the park and his property, and a pier extending into the lake.\nResidents argued the initial fence plan, which called for fences extending into the water on the north and south ends of Centennial Park beach, was intended to secure privacy for Ishbia\u2019s home to the south by limiting navigation of the shoreline. The village\u2019s Plan Commission rejected the proposal in a Jan. 28 meeting, citing the barriers the fencing would present to residents traversing the beach.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not hard to understand that only one person benefits from a fenced-in dog beach directly north of the property,\u201d resident Peggy Martay told the Plan Commission at that meeting.\nCommenters also argued the plan violated the public trust doctrine, an Illinois legal principle that requires submerged land to be open to the public.\nPark officials have denied that the project is intended to enhance privacy for Ishbia.\nIn an email to\nThe Real Deal,\nWinnetka Park District Executive Director Shannon Nazzal said the new plan does not eliminate public access and is intended \u201cto safely define a designated off-leash area while maintaining lawful public access.\u201d\nDuring the meeting last Thursday, commissioner Christina Codo said the elements required by Ishbia\u2019s donation were good for the general public.\nThe elements include \u201cpublic access, which we should all want, the dog beach \u2026 the dog beach fence, which seems to be a necessary safety feature, the ADA access pathway, which seems to be really important for this community as we all age,\u201d Codo said.\nThe new proposal to install the fence on existing steel groins that extend out to the lake addresses the access concerns, said Director of Parks and Maintenance Costa Kutulas at the Thursday meeting. It also reduces the length of the dog beach from 490 feet to 265 feet and is designed to allow beachgoers to walk around the dog park entirely.\nThe design mounts the fence on the steel wall to use \u201can already existing barrier in the lake instead of creating new barriers by installing new fencing,\u201d Kutulas said.\nBut residents said during the Park Board\u2019s meeting last Thursday that the new proposal still limits the ability to walk along the beach.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all designed to exclude people from that staircase,\u201d resident Ted Wynnychenko told the board, referring to a staircase on the breakwater at the edge of Ishbia\u2019s property. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that we\u2019ve gone back to that.\u201d\nVillage commissions will review the new plans in upcoming meetings, and the Village Board of Trustees has the final decision over approving a special use permit for the project.\nThe fight over the dog beach is just the latest chapter, as Ishbia has pursued building his lakefront mansion since 2020, spending an estimated $77 million on land and construction.\nIn 2020, the park district\nagreed to a land swap\nthat would have traded a portion of Centennial Park for Ishbia\u2019s property at 261 Sheridan Road, which sits between Centennial Park and Elder Park. That proposal, which was intended to unite the two parks, spurred a lawsuit that ended in a settlement, with the park district agreeing not to hand over the land.\nIshbia also initially planned to build walls along the stone breakwater at the edge of his property, but the plan was scrapped after public criticism that the walls obstructed the view of the lake.\n",

        "content": "Two suburban Chicago apartment properties sold for a combined $80 million last week to separate buyers as the region\u2019s multifamily hot streak continues.\nTaken together, they underscore the rising confidence of buyers from both out of state and local shops as a depressed development pipeline gives landlords the ability to raise rents at close to nation-leading rates across the Chicago area.\nIn the larger of the two transactions, Summit, New Jersey-based Solomon Organization bought The Orion59 Apartments from Manhattan Beach, California-based Orion Residential for $43 million, public records show.\nThe sale of the sprawling 224-unit, multi-building complex built in 1971 came out to about $191,000 per unit, likely marking a win for Orion. The company led by Marc Venegas and Mark Limpert first bought the apartments in 2018 for $26 million.\nOrion originally bought the Naperville apartments at 30W041 Flamenco Court in a portfolio purchase of over 1,700 units across the Chicago suburbs from Dallas-based Lone Star Funds.\nIn November,\nMarquette Companies bought another apartment complex in the same Orion portfolio\n. Naperville-based Marquette bought the 198-unit Arlington Lakes Apartments for $46 million, which came out to just over $232,000 per unit.\nThe other two Chicagoland properties in Orion\u2019s portfolio haven\u2019t yet sold. They are Orion Parkview, a 512-unit property at 1821 W. Golf Road in Mount Prospect and Orion Prospect, a 783-unit complex at 475 W. Enterprise Drive in Mount Prospect. The portfolio was originally listed in 2022.\nMeanwhile, over in Westmont, developer Holladay Properties offloaded The Quincy Station Apartments in a $37 million sale to\nBanner Real Estate Group\n, according to public records.\nThough it\u2019s unclear how much the South Bend, Indiana-based developer poured into the development in total, the company took out a $22.5 million construction mortgage from Hinsdale Bank &amp; Trust to fund the project in 2020 and refinanced the property upon completion for $27 million with a mortgage from Old National Bank, records show.\nChicago-based Banner Real Estate Group bought the 94-unit Quincy Station apartments at 1 Quincy Street in Westmont for roughly $393,000 per unit but the presence of ground floor retail spaces skews per-unit cost estimates.\nThe two suburban apartment sales come as more than\n1,700 multifamily units in the Chicago suburbs\ntraded in the last few weeks.\nThose sales were:\nOsso Capital\u2019s $110 million sale of the 730-unit Woodland of Crest Hill Apartments in Crest Hill to Bayshore Capital Partners.\nMark Manda\u2019s\n$51 million sale of the 378-unit Wheeling property\nformerly known as VIP Apartments to FPA Multifamily, which rebranded the property to ReNew Lake Arlington.\nThe Hispanic Housing Development Corporation\u2019s $31.4 million sale of the 200-unit Arrowhead Apartments in Arlington Heights to Artisan Capital Group.\nAmeritus\u2019 sale of the 248-unit Fox Pointe Apartments in Aurora to Palatine Capital Partners for $40.1 million.\nlocal investor Daniel Kotcher\u2019s sale of 226-unit Carriage Creek Apartments in Richton Park to Bender Companies for $11.9 million.\nThough sales activity in the city of Chicago has been slower, developers still recently notched a win with a\nsale of 73 East Lake Street\n.\nM&amp;R Development, which completed the building in 2014 in partnership with UBS Realty Investment, sold the 42-story, 322-unit apartment tower in the Loop to a joint venture of Magellan and Intercontinental Real Estate for $126 million.\nThe sale was the biggest multifamily transaction in the Chicago region so far this year.\nThe area\u2019s multifamily market has been performing well because of a\nhistoric low supply of new units\nhitting the market and the region\u2019s strong fundamentals like its job market and room for rent growth. Some investors\nprefer the outer suburbs\n, however, due to their\nmore predictable property tax environments.\nThe issue has drawn attention to Cook County\u2019s Property Tax Assessor\u2019s race, which is heating up ahead of\na contentious Democratic Primary next month\n.\n",

        "content": "Home prices in San Francisco are on the rise as inventory remains low compared to other parts of the Bay Area.\nThe median\nhome price\nin the city reached $1.7 million last month, marking a 12.4 percent increase from the previous January, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n, citing new data from Compass. The most expensive residential listing on the market as of early this month is a\nPresidio Heights estate\nat 3199 Jackson Avenue listed for $32 million. Condominiums are also seeing price increases across the city, with two-bedroom units reaching a median price of $1.3 million last month.\nLow housing inventory combined with increasing demand is fueling the increase in prices and ongoing\nhousing shortage, especially at the higher end of the market\n. As of the beginning of February, only 651 homes were on the market or soon to be listed, down 27 percent year-over-year and the lowest number in more than four years. The number of new listings also dropped 19 percent last month compared with a year prior. About 30 percent of the listings were single-family homes, 60 percent were condominiums, and about 10 percent were tenancy-in-common homes or co-ops.\nSo far this year, San Francisco has had so few houses available for sale that Napa County, with 16 percent of the city\u2019s population, has more homes on the market than San Francisco, according to Compass. The diminished inventory and rising demand for living space is expected to drive prices even higher this year.\nThe influx of tech and artificial intelligence workers into the city in recent years has\ncaused a shortage of mansions\nat the higher end of the market. Renters also face increasing headwinds as AI companies continue to grow in the city,\npushing up rent prices\nas tenants fight for limited supply across the city.\nBut not everyone points to the AI boom as the reason for an uptick in activity.\n\u201cWhile national home price appreciation is stuttering to a halt and many states and regions are seeing price declines, San Francisco\u2019s median home sales prices continue to surge higher, a dynamic we expect to see continue in 2026,\u201d Compass chief market analyst Patrick Carlisle said, naming the \u201cunderlying factors\u201d as \u201can extremely inadequate supply of homes for sale [versus] rapidly increasing demand due to the\n[artificial intelligence] startup boom\n.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The developers of Colony Ridge, a sprawling master-planned community north of Houston, will pay $68 million and temporarily stop expanding under a settlement with the federal government.\nThe agreement, filed Tuesday in federal court, resolves a\n2023 lawsuit\nby the U.S. Department of Justice and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau alleging the project\u2019s owners targeted Hispanic buyers with deceptive advertising and predatory, seller-financed mortgages, Houston Public Media\nreported\n.\nFederal investigators alleged Colony Ridge lured buyers with the promise of affordable homeownership, then steered them into high-risk loans without verifying their ability to repay. The DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division also alleged the developers misrepresented flood risks and operated a bait-and-switch scheme that led to elevated foreclosure rates across the development.\nUnder the settlement, Colony Ridge is barred from developing\nnew residential plats\nfor three years. The developers must also invest $48 million in infrastructure improvements and pay $20 million to boost law enforcement presence in the community. The agreement requires the company to implement borrower protections and create a plan to address credit harm tied to its lending practices.\n\u201cIntentionally targeting vulnerable borrowers with the American dream of homeownership and then trapping them in a predatory scheme is not only wrong, it also violates our civil rights laws,\u201d U.S. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said in a statement.\nThe case became a political flashpoint in Texas well before the settlement. In 2023, Republican state leaders and conservative media outlets accused Colony Ridge of creating a haven for undocumented immigrants and fueling crime \u2014 claims the developers denied at the time. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, responding to the settlement Tuesday, said some of the law enforcement funding could support 287(g) agreements that allow local officers to assist with federal immigration enforcement.\nThe settlement throws a temporary wrench into the Houston-area\nhousing market\n, as well as one of the region\u2019s most prolific land development engines. Colony Ridge has added thousands of lots in\nLiberty County\nin recent years, marketing directly to working-class Hispanic buyers often shut out of traditional mortgage channels.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "New year, same rental market.\nThat was the story for January rents in the city, where median rent for a brokered, market-rate lease in Manhattan was $4,695, the third-highest number on record, according to Miller Samuel\u2019s monthly rental report for Douglas Elliman.\nThe median rent was up 8 percent from last year, and down just slightly from December\u2019s numbers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just in this mode of steadily rising rents and until we see more of a drop in mortgage rates,\u201d said report author Jonathan Miller. \u201cI think that trend is going to be sustained for a while.\u201d\nThe luxury rental market continued to outpace the rest of the market in terms of price growth, somewhat mirroring the sales market in the city as wealthy renters or buyers continue to be able to afford higher and higher prices.\nMedian luxury rents \u2014 defined as rents in the top 10 percent of the market \u2014 rose over 14 percent annually to $11,500, continuing a trend that persisted through most of the back-half of last year. Brokers have\npreviously cited\na lack of high-end rentable inventory as one of the reasons rents have started to routinely push $100 or $200 per foot in that market.\nVacancy rate fell to 2.44 percent, well below the 10-year average in January, while inventory fell over 9 percent from last year. While some of the inventory disappearing may be a result of landlords pulling their listings off public markets after the passage of the FARE Act in June, the falling vacancy rate indicates that more than anything, \u201cthe market\u2019s still tight,\u201d said Miller.\nIn Brooklyn, median rent was $3,814, up 9 percent from a year ago, while new leases signed and leasing inventory were down significantly compared to last year.\nIn northwest Queens, including the neighborhoods of Astoria, Sunnyside, Woodside and Long Island City, median rent was up over 10 percent annually to $3,754 per month.\nMiller has been closely watching the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision-making on rate cuts, which can trickle down to lower mortgage rates. Lower mortgage rates mean more homebuyers and likely fewer renters. But after a surprisingly robust jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics came out on Wednesday, the odds of relief just grew slimmer, according to Miller.\n\u201cThe possibility of mortgage rates sliding seems more and more remote,\u201d he said. \u201cEmployment popped this month higher than expected, which makes it pretty hard to cut rates.\u201d\n",

        "content": "As South Florida\u2019s multifamily market slows, AvalonBay Communities and MG Developer are proposing 374 apartments in separate Miami projects.\nArlington, Virginia-based AvalonBay wants to develop an eight-story, 166-unit building on a 1.6-acre site on the southwest corner of Southwest 23rd Street and Southwest 32nd Avenue, according to its application to the Miami Urban Development Review Board.\nAvalonBay paid $11.2 million for the site in November, property records show. It consists of lots at 2340 Southwest 32nd Avenue, 3224-3232 Southwest 23rd Street, and 3209, 3219 and 3231 Southwest 32nd Terrace.\nDesigned by Baker Barrios Architects, the project, called Kanso Coral Way, will taper down to three stories on the west side, where it will include townhome-style units, the application shows. It will have 21 studios, 75 one-bedroom units, 39 two-bedroom units, 18 one-bedroom lofts, five two-bedroom lofts, and eight three-bedroom units.\nCoral Gables-based MG Developer is proposing five- and six-story buildings with 208 multifamily units at the site of a hotel it owns at 1000 Northwest 42nd Avenue, near Miami International Airport, according to the firm\u2019s application.\nThe buildings would rise on the parking lot surrounding the five-story, 176-key Regency Miami Airport by Sonesta, which MG Developer purchased for\n$36 million\nin 2024.\nDesigned by Behar Font &amp; Partners, MG Developer\u2019s project is called Regency Parc &amp; Residences.\nThe site is also near the Miami Freedom Park project that\u2019s under construction. David Beckham, and Jorge and Jose Mas, are developing the complex with a 25,000-seat stadium for Inter Miami CF, as well as offices and retail.\nMG Developer is seeking the board\u2019s approval for three waivers, including for 161-foot pedestrian distances, more than the maximum allowed of 75 feet, as well as for an extension of the parking into the building\u2019s second layer and for a reduction of the required lot frontage.\nMiami\u2019s Urban Development Review Board will review the two proposals next week.\nAvalonBay, led by Benjamin W. Schall, is a real estate investment trust that develops and invests in multifamily, with a portfolio of nearly 100,000 units nationwide, according to its website and application. It has a pipeline of 7,800 units under construction across 21 projects.\nIn August, it paid\n$98.3 million\nfor the 270-unit garden-style complex at 5401 Wiles Road in Coconut Creek. In 2024, AvalonBay completed the 254-unit Avalon Merrick Park near the Douglas Road Metrorail station in Miami.\nMG Developer, led by\nAlirio Torrealba\n, was founded in 2014 and initially focused on Coral Gables, where it launched sales last year of the 78-unit\nAlhambra Parc\ncondominium at 33 Alhambra Circle. Vertical Developments is a project partner.\nThe firm has expanded beyond Coral Gables, planning\nDoral Parc\nwith partner Ernesto de Luca in Doral. The project will consist of three mixed-use buildings with 552 apartments, nearly 23,000 square feet of ground-floor retail and two garages. MG Developer also has been developing the three-phase\nMetro Parc\nin Hialeah and has plans for development in\nPrinceton\n.\nAfter developers jumped on South Florida\u2019s pandemic-era multifamily boom, defined by unprecedented demand and rent growth, they completed a record number of units in 2024. The deliveries came just as the in-migration lessened, leading to slower leaseups, more concessions and a\nsupply overhang\n.\nStill, developers starting projects now argue that by the time their new buildings are completed,\ndemand\nwould have caught up and rent growth will be restored.\n",

        "pub_date_dt": "2026-02-12T17:02:00",
        "content": "When the City Council approved the rezoning of 42 blocks in Midtown South, it excluded 37 properties in the Garment District from changes that would pave the way for more housing.\nNow the owner of one of those properties is considering zoning changes to allow residential space anyway.\nManocherian Brothers signaled in a brief summary filed with the Department of City Planning that it wants to rezone 257 West 39th Street, a 16-story commercial building that is home to various fabric shops.\nThe owner filed a preliminary description of the project in December, calling for a partial conversion of the building to residential use. The site, along with the other 36 buildings carved out, is zoned for commercial, light manufacturing and community facility uses.\nNo application materials have yet been filed, and a property manager at the firm declined to comment.\nUnder a previous proposal, the northwest quadrant of the Midtown South plan would have been rezoned as M1-9A/R-12, a designation that allows both commercial and high-density residential use. But before approving the rezoning, the City Council made a number of changes. One was to drop the residential \u2014\u00a0R-12 \u2014\u00a0change from the Garment District, instead switching the area\u2019s zoning from M1-6 to M1-9A.\nAt the time, Council member Kevin Riley, then-chair of the subcommittee on zoning and franchises, said the\ncarveout\nwas in service of preserving a \u201cunique cluster of businesses\u201d in the Garment District. The New York Fashion Workforce Development Coalition agreed, praising the changes as \u201cvital protections\u201d for the district.\nThe building on 39th Street has fabric shops on the ground floor, including AK Fabrics, It\u2019s a Material World, Beckenstein Fabrics and Fabric House. More shops have taken residence on the upper floors, though one tenant indicated that much of the building sits vacant.\nThe street is among the endangered \u201cclusters\u201d referenced by Riley. The building next door, at 251 West 39th, is also home to several fabric and wholesale embellishments and accessory stores. Across the street is the Drama Book Shop, a reminder of the area\u2019s history of feeding the wardrobe needs of the nearby Theater District.\nBut you don\u2019t have to venture far for traces of that history to dissipate: Chain and fast-casual restaurants dominate 40th Street and have taken over much of 38th as well.\nAn analysis by PropertyScout found that most (more than 84 percent) of the Midtown South rezoning district is dedicated to commercial use, followed by residential at about 13 percent and manufacturing at 1.2 percent. PropertyScout CEO Wilson Parry pointed out that the original certificate of occupancy for the 39th Street building shows the property once served as tenement housing, which likely makes the property a good candidate for conversion, at least from an access to light and air perspective.\nIt\u2019s unclear if more property owners will seek site-specific zoning changes within the carveout area. However, if others follow Manocherian Brothers, the proposals could call into question the logic of the City Council\u2019s rezoning modifications, especially as the administration tries to ramp up housing construction. The city projects that the rezoning will allow the construction of more than 9,500 housing units, a decrease of\n200 units\nfrom the city\u2019s estimate before the Council\u2019s changes (though some have estimated the loss to be much greater).\nSuch individual zoning changes would be reviewed by the person who replaces local Council member Erik Bottcher, who won a special election this month to fill Brad Hoylman-Sigal\u2019s seat in the state Senate. Whoever takes over for Bottcher may have less final-say power for such proposals thanks to\nballot measures\nweakening the Council\u2019s tradition of member deference.\nThe northwest quadrant carveout drew the ire of some owners hoping to convert their properties or sell at a higher premium. At least\none property\nwithin that area was being marketed as completely vacant and ready for residential conversion right before the City Council amended the rezoning proposal.\nThe Garment District Alliance, a business improvement district whose board members include local property owners, opposed the Council\u2019s amendments, arguing that the city was needlessly leaving housing opportunities on the table.\nThe group recently conducted a survey of the 37 properties in the carveout and found a nearly 30 percent vacancy (though this doesn\u2019t account for any pending leases).\nBarbara Blair, president of the Garment District Alliance, said the zoning carveout sidelines an area where the city should be encouraging growth, given its proximity to the Port Authority Bus Terminal and Penn Station.\n\u201cIt\u2019s critically important that this is a high functioning neighborhood because it\u2019s a port of entry,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that the city should revisit it.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A mystery surrounding Oak Street\u2019s newest luxury storefront is solved, and the answer lies just one door away.\nVan Cleef &amp; Arpels is set to move its Chicago flagship into the planned redevelopment at 67 East Oak Street, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. The French jewelry house will lease about 3,500 square feet in the building, which is set to be built out to accommodate the brand\u2019s high-end aesthetic.\nThe Van Cleef move underscores a trend across the world\u2019s premier shopping strips such as Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills \u2014 where\nHerm\u00e8s recently spent a record $400 million\non property \u2014 and Bond Street in London. Luxury brands want to stand out as much as possible by exercising more control over their own real estate, people familiar with the Oak Street deal said.\nBy securing its own building where it will be the largest and most noticeable tenant, Van Cleef is separating from its current space at 65 East Oak Street, between Chanel and Moncler, which collectively take up a larger portion of the adjacent building than Van Cleef.\nThe move marks a high-stakes game of musical chairs \u2014 and an expansion for Van Cleef \u2014 on the Gold Coast\u2019s most exclusive shopping corridor. Van Cleef is relocating from a property as its German institutional landlord\nUnion Investment has been shopping it for sale\n.\nUnion hired Newmark in October to list the property, six years after acquiring it for a staggering\n$120 million in 2019\n. That pre-pandemic deal, which remains the largest price per square foot ever paid for a Chicago retail property at over $4,100, set a high bar for Oak Street. However, with one of the building\u2019s tenants headed next door, the valuation of the property could face fresh scrutiny as it hits the market.\nA spokesperson for Van Cleef said it didn\u2019t have any additional information Thursday but added, \u201cWe can be in touch closer to the opening.\u201d Union Investment said it wouldn\u2019t comment on \u201cmarket rumors.\u201d\nThe redevelopment at 67 East Oak represents a modern evolution for the block. The new two-story structure will replace a five-story Victorian-era building, continuing a movement toward sleek, glass-heavy modernist designs that are redefining the Gold Coast\u2019s aesthetic. By securing a tenant as prestigious as Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, the developers of the building have validated demand for purpose-built, boutique luxury spaces even as the broader retail market faces some headwinds,\u00a0especially on the Magnificent Mile where vacancy remains over 25 percent.\nA shroud of uncertainty still surrounds the identity of Van Cleef\u2019s next landlord. The property at 67 East Oak was transferred about a year ago by a trust that obscured its ownership to an LLC managed by real estate attorneys Ellen and Laura Distelheim, who appear to be based in Highland Park. The LLC in September took out a $9.1 million construction mortgage against the property from Wintrust.\nThe Distelheims didn\u2019t return requests for comment. An architect with Myefski Architects who\u2019s working on the design for the building at 67 East Oak Street declined to comment, and a consultant on the project with Chicago-based Malet Realty didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\nThe jeweler\u2019s pending move has sparked speculation that one of Union Investment\u2019s current tenants at 65 East Oak, namely Chanel, could take the opportunity to expand into the Van Cleef space once it\u2019s vacated. The jeweler\u2019s new space should be operationally ready within 18 months to two years, a person familiar with the property said.\nA\nSavills team led by Todd Siegel\nrepresented the landlord in negotiating the lease at 67 East Oak, and declined to comment. A representative of Odyssey Retail Advisors, a brokerage that works with Van Cleef parent company Richemont, declined to comment.\nWhile some Chicago submarkets have struggled with retail vacancies, the Gold Coast\u2019s luxury market has remained a bastion of resilience. Oak Street continues to attract global brands seeking a presence in the Midwest\u2019s premier shopping district.\nRecent transactions backing that claim include the\n$17 million sale in late 2024 of the nearby property at 41 East Oak Street\n, which Bottega Veneta leases, to the Maramotti family that owns Max Mara. Furthermore, Burdeen\u2019s Jewelry also planted its flag on Oak Street in recent years, with a lease spanning two stories in the 10,000-square-foot former Northern Trust building at 120 East Oak Street. Landlord\nL3 Capital has also sought to sell the property\nover the past year without yet finding a buyer.\n",

The four-story office structure is expected to sell for roughly $800 per square foot, leading to a total price of more than $100 million, sources told the Business Times, though SKS said that pricing estimate was inaccurate.\nThe developer began construction on the office and light industrial building in 2019. Tech company Samsara pre-leased the entire 86,000-square-foot office portion later that year and today maintains its global headquarters at the site. The property also includes 43,000 square feet of light industrial space; the tenant there is unclear.\nSKS secured $93 million in construction-to-permanent financing, consisting of a $56 million senior loan and $37 million in mezzanine funds. The $56 million loan matures in April.\nConstruction on the building wrapped in 2021.\nThe potential sale of 1 De Haro would be a rare handover of a stabilized office asset in San Francisco, according to the Business Times. Last month, DivcoWest acquired a major stake in 101 California Street for an undisclosed price; the tower\nhit the market late last year\nat $900 per square foot, giving it a roughly $1.1 billion valuation.\nIn the past three years, most buildings in San Francisco have sold with high\nvacancy rates\nor other issues like financial distress.

        "content": "Everyone in real estate had a chance to check out the renovated Waldorf Astoria at the\nREBNY annual gala\nlast month. Now, they\u2019ll have an opportunity to buy it.\nDajia Insurance Group, a state-run Chinese firm, is planning on putting the historic Manhattan property up for sale, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. Eastdil Secured will be in charge of marketing the property when it likely goes up for sale next month, expected to ask for at least $1 billion.\nThe full-block property on Park Avenue recently underwent a lengthy eight-year redevelopment. The renovation reduced the hotel portion of the property to 375 rooms, while also creating a 372-unit condominium offering; those units would still be sold separately, though the property\u2019s sale would include adjoining restaurants and retail sites.\nRoughly a year ago, the Waldorf Astoria landed its\nfirst condo closings\nsince the development launched in 2017.\nThat redevelopment was disrupted a year later when the\nChinese government seized Anbang Insurance Group\n, the original developer of the project, as part of a crackdown on companies with large foreign outlays. Months later, Anbang chief executive officer Wu Xiaohui was sentenced to 18 years in prison. Angbang had originally purchased the building in 2015 for $1.95 billion.\nThe hotel was eventually transferred to Dajia US, the American subsidiary of a Chinese government-established entity, and\nsales launched in early March 2020\n\u2014 days before the physical sales gallery was\nshut down due to Covid\n.\nTwo years later, the\nchief executive of Dajia US\nleft the project amid pandemic-induced cost overruns and project delays, as well as difficulties converting the landmarked property. At that time, sources familiar with the development projected work being finished by the end of 2023 at the earliest. It took another two years.\nWith construction overruns, the project cost more than $4 billion in total. While the sellers will be looking for at least $1 billion, they don\u2019t anticipate recouping all of the costs from the redevelopment, especially considering the small number of buyers who could put up ten figures for the site.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Sign up to get early access\nhere\n.\nA city-controlled land bank could soon acquire tax-delinquent properties and redevelop some of those parcels into affordable housing.\nThat\u2019s the idea behind four City Council bills approved with little fanfare in late January that are poised to transform the city\u2019s contentious tax lien sale, moving it away from the current model of selling liens to a private trust that charges owners hefty interest and can move to foreclose.\nUnder the legislation, a New York City Land Trust would have the authority to acquire tax liens from the city and transfer those properties to partners who would rehabilitate distressed or vacant parcels into income-restricted housing, while continuing to collect municipal arrears. Before officials can get started on any of that work, however, the city must apply for authorization from the New York State Urban Development Corp. and develop specific rules to govern the land bank.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to add to our toolbox to maintain and produce affordable housing,\u201d said Council member Gale Brewer, who sponsored a bill to establish the land bank. \u201cHow can we be innovative about the lien sale, instead of having properties just go to the highest bidder?\u201d\nThe bills are poised to become law by March, and crucially, they have the backing of the Mamdani administration. Matt Rauschenbach, a spokesperson for the mayor, told\nThe Real Deal\nthat the administration looks forward to implementing the land bank bills \u201cto keep New Yorkers safe, stable and in their homes.\u201d\nThe City Council initially passed the package of bills in December, but former Mayor Eric Adams vetoed the legislation out of concern that it would reduce the city\u2019s collection of arrears. On Jan. 29, a Council supermajority overrode those vetoes.\nBrewer\u2019s bill, which she said would enable the city to target \u201clikely dozens not thousands\u201d of properties to rehabilitate, creates a seven-member board of directors to control the land bank. It would be made up of appointees by Mayor Mamdani, the commissioners of the city\u2019s housing and finance departments and Council Speaker Julie Menin.\nHuge questions remain unresolved, however, about how such a land bank would function, and if the new system would result in substantially different outcomes for property owners.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still some uncertainty here about what the process will change,\u201d said Rachel Geballe, an attorney with Brooklyn Legal Services and a member of the Coalition for Affordable Homes, which is made up of more than 30 housing and community organizations that advocate for tax lien sale reform. \u201cThis is the first step in a longer journey,\u201d she added.\nFor starters, appointees to the board have to create bylaws on how the land bank would acquire and prioritize properties \u2014 this months-long process would include a public hearing to inform those rules \u2014 and then the board must submit an application to the Urban Development Corp. for permission to create the land bank. Once the application is with the state-run agency, it will take up to two months to process, but approval is all but assured.\nThe Urban Development Corp. has only once denied an application for a land bank, and that was due to a jurisdiction squabble because a county and a city within it submitted competing land bank applications, said Emily Mijatovic, a spokesperson for the Empire State Development Corp., which oversees Urban Development Corp.\nState push\nThe passage of the city legislation comes just as Gov. Kathy Hochul is pushing to expand the use of land banks as a tool to create and preserve affordable housing throughout the state. As part of her proposed budget, Hochul plans to increase the cap on the number of land banks that can be established in New York from 35 to 45 \u2014 there are currently 31 land banks across the state, including in Albany, Rochester and Syracuse. So far, none exist in the five boroughs.\nData from the New York Land Bank Association, an organization founded in 2015 to support the state\u2019s land banks, found that the land banks have returned $135 million in assessed value to local tax rolls over the last 13 years. That includes rehabilitating 3,231 properties, the association said.\nThe Hochul administration has made $170 million available to support land banks in the state since 2023. City lawmakers have separately sought to create a city land bank in previous years, but they ultimately weren\u2019t able to drum up enough support.\nFour bills toward tax lien reform\nBack in 2024 the City Council gave the Department of Finance permission to hold an annual tax lien sale\nthrough 2028\n. A tax lien auction doesn\u2019t have to occur each year \u2014 the mayor can put off a sale and has multiple times \u2014 but when they do, they\u2019ll have new requirements geared toward reforming the system thanks to the package of council legislation.\nBeyond Brewer\u2019s bill to establish the land bank, another bill, sponsored by former City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, formally authorizes the city to sell tax liens to a city land bank during any future sales. It also requires that any purchaser of a tax lien on a one- to three-unit residential property that is occupied by the owner cannot foreclose upon that lien until at least one year has passed after the sale and the value of the lien reaches either 15% of the property value or $70,000, whichever is the lesser amount.\nJennifer Polovetsky, partner at Duane Morris, who worked in the city\u2019s law department during the Giuliani administration handling tax lien sales and in rem foreclosures, said she\u2019s pleased with the new protections for homeowners, and that the bill differentiates more between owner-occupied housing and landlords who own multi-family rental buildings.\n\u201cTo take people\u2019s homes away for tax liens that are minimal, I think, is unfair, at the same time, everybody has to pay their taxes,\u201d said Polovetsky. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult balancing act.\u201d\nTo that end, a bill sponsored by Council member Sandy Nurse requires future tax lien purchases to make \u201cbest efforts\u201d to transfer those liens to the city land bank \u201cupon certain triggering events.\u201d That includes any tax liens being sold to the city\u2019s NYCTL 1998-2 Trust, often referred to as the graveyard trust. The trust warehouses the riskiest city liens, and currently holds 3,902 tax liens, according to Department of Finance data obtained by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nAs of 2025, the city\u2019s tax lien trusts contain 7,270 liens. That includes 3,468 liens on one, two or three-family homes, 2,452 on commercial properties and 1,355 on multi-family parcels, according to the DOF data. DOF spokesperson Ryan Lavis said the agency has not released a list of eligible properties for the next lien sale, which hasn\u2019t been scheduled yet.\nAnother bill sponsored by Nurse also requires the DOF to submit annual reports on properties with chronically unresolved liens \u2014 those outstanding for 36 or more months after being sold.\nA controversial program\nThe current tax lien sale process, established under the Giuliani administration in 1996, has faced criticism virtually since its creation for opening up property owners to predatory debt collectors. The system also has a reputation for being opaque and a beast to navigate.\nThe city adds a parcel to the tax lien sale list when its owner has long-overdue property taxes or water and sewer bills. The debt is sold to an authorized buyer, usually the Bank of New York Mellon and their servicer companies, MTAG Services, LLC and Tower Capital Management (Mellon, MTAG and Tower Capital did not return requests for comment on the bills). If the owner can\u2019t pay their arrears, plus accumulated interest, the firms foreclose on the property.\nUnder the new model, the land bank and its partners could take on some of these responsibilities, but perhaps the biggest unanswered question is: how will this be financed? As written, the council bills do not identify a specific funding mechanism for the land bank, though Hochul\u2019s support could help. It\u2019s also unclear which city agency would oversee and staff the entity, and who would partner with the city to redevelop properties under its control. Nonprofit community land trusts are one such partner the council is exploring, and for which grass-roots community and housing groups are pushing.\nAll those lingering questions have the real estate industry feeling wary.\nDev Awasthi, vice president of government affairs at the Real Estate Board of New York, noted that land banks can be successful in producing housing, but that the city must provide the new entity with the resources it needs in the upcoming budget \u2014 a tall order given the city\u2019s multi-billion dollar budget chasm.\nAnn Korchak, board president of the Small Property Owners of New York, went further and called the prospect of a city land bank \u201cvery troubling.\u201d\n\u201cTo my mind, it\u2019s another opportunity to create a COPA-like scenario to swoop in and take over distressed properties,\u201d said Korchak, referring to the\nCommunity Opportunity to Purchase Act\n. The controversial City Council bill would have given city-approved nonprofits, as well as joint ventures with for-profit companies, the first opportunity to purchase certain distressed multifamily buildings, or those with soon-to-expire affordability requirements.\n\u201cWe\u2019re watching this very closely,\u201d added Korchak.\n",

        "content": "A Marriott-branded hotel on downtown Long Beach\u2019s Ocean Boulevard traded hands for about half its prior price tag.\nThe Westin, at 333 East Ocean Boulevard and near the water, sold for about $42 million, according to records dated late last month,\ncompared to\nits sale price of $85 million nine years ago. Rockpoint and Highgate sold the 469-room hotel in the heart of the city\u2019s downtown to Khanna Enterprises, which received a $39 million note for the deal.\nThat trade comes out to less than $100,000 per key for the high-rise hotel. Los Angeles\u2019\nhotel world\nis in a rut, but that\u2019s still a very low per-key price that may have more to do with an upcoming cost the seller was on the hook for: a property improvement plan. That is basically an action plan designed to bring an individual hotel into compliance with the latest brand standards. An informed industry source said the property improvement plan was around $25 million.\nAnd things were already costly. The sellers completed a $23 million renovation of the hotel with a curved, modern facade, surrounded by palm trees, where a fountain sits at its entrance, two years after purchasing it. In 2024, the Long Beach hotel\u2019s unionized workers went on strike and later negotiated a new contract and a wage increase.\nLast year, Los Angeles\u2019 priciest per-key\ndeal\nwas in Malibu (it was one of California\u2019s priciest per-key deals ever, too). Luxury fashion brand Chrome Hearts, owned by Richard and Laurie Stark, purchased the luxe oceanfront Surfrider for $37.5 million from Dauntless Capital Partners. That deal came out to almost $2 million a room, but its pricing was an exception. Still, a West Hollywood hotel\ndeal\nthat had a per-key price reflective of the current market commanded more than the Long Beach trade, at $333,000 per room.\nRepresentatives for Khanna Enterprises, Rockpoint and Highgate did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOrange County-based and family-owned Khanna Enterprises has made discounted buys before. In 2022, it\npurchased\na Westin in San Jose for about $45 million, or 30 percent less than what the property commanded in 2017. Major players Rockpoint and Highgate have previously partnered on deals via joint ventures.\n",

        "content": "A long-vacant State Street landmark in Chicago could soon be fostering more than nostalgia.\nThe eight-story former department store at 401 South State Street \u2014 a hulking 485,000-square-foot building steps from the Harold Washington Library \u2014 is being pitched as an urban farming and food innovation hub. CoStar\nreported\nthat local investor Marc Calabria, who bought the property out of distress for\n$4.2 million last year\n, is teaming up with vertical farming firm Farm Zero to transform the space into what they describe as a first-of-its-kind controlled-environment agriculture campus.\nThe plan would carve the\nhistoric structure\ninto layers of vertical farming racks, research labs and startup space, alongside a public-facing produce market, restaurants and a rooftop outfitted with greenhouses, solar panels and outdoor dining. Calabria said he also intends to convert a portion of the building into student or senior housing, running parallel to the agriculture project as financing comes together. Total redevelopment costs have not been disclosed.\nFarm Zero\nhas already been testing its model in the Loop, growing leafy greens and herbs inside office towers at 30 North LaSalle Street and preparing to expand at 125 South Wacker Drive. The outlet reported that the State Street building would mark a leap from proof of concept to ecosystem, merging food production with health research and entrepreneurship under one roof.\nThe venture is expected to involve the Institute for Food Safety and Health, a partnership between Illinois Institute of Technology and the Food and Drug Administration, as well as Netherlands-based urban\nagriculture experts\n. The goal is to turn underused commercial real estate into local food infrastructure, with an emphasis on \u201cfood as medicine\u201d initiatives that tie fresh produce to chronic disease prevention and treatment, according to the publication.\nThe proposal adds a twist to the office-to-anything trend reshaping downtowns nationwide. While many distressed buildings are being eyed for apartments or data centers, Calabria\u2019s concept hinges on agriculture as adaptive reuse.\nThe building itself carries architectural heft. Designed by William Le Baron Jenney and completed in 1891, it is both a national and Chicago landmark, having housed Siegel, Cooper &amp; Company and later Sears before becoming an academic facility. Its prior $68 million valuation evaporated after tenant Robert Morris University vacated in 2020. Calabria\u2019s fall 2025 purchase equated to $9 per square foot.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Higher borrowing costs, policy uncertainty and homeowners clinging to sub-3 percent mortgages have cooled demand and throttled new construction.\nBut while overall\nvolume\nis down, market share is consolidating.\nThe top four homebuilders accounted for more than half of all permits issued in San Antonio last year. Lennar alone pulled 1,246 permits \u2014 or almost 33 percent of the citywide total \u2014 cementing its lead in the\nAlamo City\n. The\nMiami-based builder\nhas topped the local rankings since 2023, when it nudged past D.R. Horton in new home starts, according to Zonda.\nD.R. Horton, long a heavyweight in Texas, slipped to third place by permits filed, with 196. Los Angeles-based KB Home claimed the No. 2 spot with 394 permits.\n\u201cSan Antonio is already highly concentrated,\u201d Zonda Advisory principal Bryan Glasshagel told the publication in January. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine Lennar or D.R. Horton grabbing much more share than they already have.\u201d\nEven in a slower cycle, San Antonio\u2019s fundamentals are keeping national builders engaged. Compared to other major metros, land remains relatively affordable and the permitting process comparatively streamlined, allowing builders to deliver lower-priced units more quickly.\nGeography tells the bigger story, as about 45 percent of last year\u2019s permits were issued on the city\u2019s South Side, particularly around Texas A&amp;M University \u2013 San Antonio, Von Ormy and Mitchell Lake. Once overlooked, the area has become a development darling thanks to cheaper land, public incentives and a wave of institutional investment.\nToyota has continued to expand its manufacturing space there, and British equipment maker JCB is relocating its North American headquarters to the area as well. Master-planned projects like\nSouthstar\u2019s\n600-acre VIDA community are rising alongside campus growth and infrastructure upgrades.\nThe West and Far West sides also captured more than 600 permits combined, buoyed by retail expansion and attainable lot prices.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Compass agent Kyle Blackmon just made a pretty penny off his company\u2019s stock.\nBut it wasn\u2019t for selling high or buying low. The veteran New York City luxury broker was awarded $5.5 million by a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) arbitration panel in a complaint he brought against UBS Financial Services over how it handled his Compass stock options and shares.\nIn January 2025, Blackmon brought a complaint to FINRA, which regulates the financial brokerage industry, accusing UBS of mishandling his unexercised stock options around Compass\u2019 initial public offering.\nCompass went public in 2021 with a share price around $20, but watched its stock fall to as low as $2 as interest rates spiked and the housing market cratered in the coming years. Its price has since rebounded as the brokerage\u2019s growth has continued to outpace the housing market and Compass has delivered cash-flow positive quarters in recent years.\nThe recommendations at issue involved \u201cvery complex\u201d trading strategies, a person familiar with Blackmon\u2019s claim told\nAdvisorHub\n. Blackmon claimed that UBS breached its fiduciary duty and violated an SEC rule governing how broker-dealers advise their clients, according to the arbitration award published by FINRA.\nThe hearings lasted over nine days starting on Jan. 26 and took place before a two-person panel in Boca Raton, Florida. Blackmon is registered in both New York and Florida.\nBlackmon did not respond to a request for comment. An attorney for UBS did not respond to a request for comment.\nBlackmon\nmade waves\nin the industry when he joined the fledgling Compass \u2014 then Urban Compass \u2014 in 2014. He had previously spent more than a decade at Brown Harris Stevens, where he made a name for himself when he sold former Citigroup chairman Sanford Weill\u2019s penthouse apartment at 15 Central Park West for\n$88 million\n, a record price in the city at the time.\nAt Compass, Blackmon, who has been described as a prototypical Southern gentleman, has continued to be a steady producer. He ranked 26th in\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s top agent rankings by deal volume in 2019.\nHis clients have included the former CEO of NBCUniversal, whose co-op Blackmon sold this week for\n$15 million\n, to Rupert Murdoch, whose Flatiron penthouse Blackmon sold for\n$24 million\nin 2024.\n",

        "content": "Dalfen Industrial cashed out of a Palm Beach County warehouse complex for $79.6 million, marking a 31.4 percent gain from its 2021 price as the market rebounds.\nAn entity tied to Dallas-based Dalfen Industrial and Goldman Sachs sold the Turnpike Logistics Center at 1673 and 1715 Meathe Drive in an unincorporated area of the county to Boston-based Cabot, according to records and real estate database Vizzda.\nThe price amounts to roughly $251 per square foot.\nDalfen paid\n$60.6 million\n, or about $191 per square foot, for the complex in 2021, when it was just completed.\nBillionaire developer and investor Jeff Greene developed Turnpike Logistics Center, consisting of a 124,500-square-foot building and a 193,000-square-foot building on nearly 30 acres, property records show.\nTenants include Eastern Metal Supply, KNOX Stones and Vault Logistics.\nCabot, led by Franz F. Colloredo-Mansfeld, was founded in 1986 and has invested over $17 billion in logistics properties, according to its website.\nThis purchase brought its South Florida shopping spree to 1.3 million square feet of industrial space. The firm also bought the two-building McCoy Logistics Center in Orlando, according to a Cabot news release. It also bought an industrial building at 2850 Ranch House Road, south of Palm Beach International Airport, the release says.\nIn Cabot\u2019s other South Florida deals, it sold the 231,000-square-foot warehouse at 3425 Meridian Parkway in Weston for\n$56 million\nin September, marking the\neighth\n-largest industrial deal in South Florida last year. Cabot paid\n$38.7 million\nfor the Pompano Business Center II, a 137,00-square-foot facility at 3001 West Copans Road in Pompano Beach.\nDalfen, led by Sean Dalfen, is an industrial investment firm, with more than $4.9 billion of assets under management across over 59 million square feet, according to its website. In South Florida, the firm sold Interstate Park Logistics Center at 3774 Interstate Park Road North in Riviera Beach for\n$55 million\nin 2024, and it bought the 192,000-square-foot warehouse at 5770 Miami Lakes Drive in Miami Lakes for\n$30.1 million\nin October.\nPalm Beach County\u2019s industrial market rebounded in the fourth quarter with a 6.8 percent vacancy rate, down from 7.2 percent in the previous quarter but slightly above the rate of 6.2 percent a year prior, according to Colliers. The drop in vacancy is partly due to a construction slowdown.\nOverall asking rents reached $16 per square foot, triple net, higher than the $15.83 a foot in the third quarter and $15.90 in the fourth quarter of last year, according to Colliers. Countywide, absorption last year reached 142,000 square feet.\n",

        "content": "The extent to which landlords across Los Angeles took advantage of the wildfire tragedy last year is the subject of a report attempting to quantify the narrative.\nWhen the blazes displaced thousands of residents in and around Pacific Palisades and Altadena,\nlandlords hiked up rental prices\nacross Los Angeles County despite calls from officials to crack down on price going, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n, citing data from Rent Brigade.\nThe tenant advocacy group analyzed Zillow listings in the year after the fires and found 18,360 potential instances of rent hikes exceeding 10 percent, potentially violating the anti-gouging rules signed by\nGov. Gavin Newsom\non Jan. 7, 2025, the day the fires broke out.\nCity and state authorities have filed only 12 lawsuits so far, even though officials vowed widespread enforcement. The legislation is in effect until Feb. 27.\nA Beverly Grove condo\u2019s listing price was hiked from $5,000 to $8,000 per month in the week after the fire, in one example. A property in Venice listed for 60 percent above its previous price, while the advertised rent price for a home in Santa Monica increased more than 100 percent.\n\u201cI was shocked by how many clear, unavoidable cases of price gouging there were,\u201d Philip Meyer, a co-author of the Rent Brigade report, told the outlet. \u201cA lot of folks didn\u2019t seem to think there\u2019d be any accountability, so they were breaking the law in plain view.\u201d\nOf the \u201cillegal listings,\u201d 42 percent were in L.A. County\u2019s Third District, which includes Pacific Palisades, as well as surrounding communities where many fire victims tried to relocate such as\nMalibu\n, Santa Monica, Venice and Calabasas.\nThe report claims that as much as $49 million in excess rent may have been collected over the past year. The actual number is likely much lower because the $49 million figure assumes that all 18,360 listings ended up being rented at the advertised price. The number of \u201cillegal listings\u201d could also be slightly lower as Zillow listings don\u2019t provide information on actual leases signed.\nL.A. County raised the price-gouging penalty to $50,000 from $10,000 a year ago, and the L.A. City Council increased the maximum penalty to $30,000. In July, the L.A. County Board of Supervisors allowed the Department of Consumer and Business Affairs to bypass the district attorney and directly fine price gougers, making it easier to go after landlords breaking the law.\nThe California Department of Justice\u2019s Disaster Relief Task Force, sent 753 warning letters to hotels and landlords who were accused of price gouging. State Attorney General Rob Bonta\u2019s office has filed five price-gouging lawsuits against individual landlords. L.A. City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto\u2019s office\nhas filed seven price-gouging lawsuits\nagainst individual landlords as well as housing companies like Blueground and Airbnb. L.A. County District Attorney Nathan Hochman hasn\u2019t prosecuted a single price-gouging case, acknowledging the work of city and state legal officials.\nAll 12 cases are currently pending or awaiting trial.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Rent price changes in San Francisco and Los Angeles over the past year tell a tale of two very different cities.\nSan Francisco rents in January were up 13 percent from a year before, while the median rent in Los Angeles fell 1.8 percent during the same period, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n, citing new data from Apartment List. San Francisco saw the highest rate since late 2019, while Los Angeles had the lowest rate since 2021.\nSupply is believed to be one of the biggest contributors to the gap between the two cities.\n\u201cSan Francisco has had a declining multifamily construction pipeline since 2018, whereas L.A. remained elevated through 2022,\u201d Rob Warnock, lead economic researcher at Apartment List, told the Chronicle.\nLast year, 15,095 multifamily units were completed in the Los Angeles area, marking an 18 percent increase from the year before, per CoStar data cited by the Chronicle. In San Francisco,\nhousing completions declined sharply\nafter the pandemic, with 2024 seeing the lowest number of finished projects in a decade with 1,597. The years of \u201cstrong production\u201d in Los Angeles \u201care paying dividends today by providing more apartments to absorb demand longer,\u201d Warnock said.\nWith the market flush with new supply, the vacancy rate in Los Angeles rose to a four-year high in January of 6.1 percent. San Francisco\u2019s was down to 3.3 percent, below the 4 percent registered in 2019.\nThe influx of artificial intelligence companies to San Francisco and growth of current tenants like OpenAI and\nAnthropic\nare expected to drive up demand for residences in the city and across the Bay Area in the coming years.\nPrices are\nalready following suit\nin San Francisco as\nheightened demand meets diminished supply\n. In the 94158 zip code that includes OpenAI and Nvidia\u2019s homes in Mission Bay, rents have increased 36 percent over the past year, while the surrounding 94107 zip code including South of Market, Potrero Hill and Dogpatch are up 21 percent. \u201cDemand is skyrocketing thanks to the AI industry,\u201d Warnock said.\nLast year,\nCBRE predicted\nthat AI companies\u2019 expansion could bring up to 60,000 new jobs to San Francisco, but job numbers in both San Francisco and Los Angeles tell a different story. Los Angeles County lost a net 6,700 jobs between December 2024 and December 2025, while San Francisco and San Mateo County together lost a net 4,400 jobs during that time, including 4,500 job losses in the tech-heavy information sector.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Cook County is barreling toward a tax sale it may not legally be able to afford.\nUnless Springfield lawmakers act within days, the county\u2019s annual auction of delinquent property tax debts will move forward in March, potentially compounding what housing advocates and legal experts say is a mounting constitutional liability. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat the urgency stems from the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2023 decision in Tyler v. Hennepin County, which found that governments violate the Fifth Amendment when they seize and sell a property over\nunpaid taxes\nand keep the excess equity.\nIllinois has yet to overhaul its tax sale system to comply.\nThat leaves Cook County Treasurer\nMaria Pappas\nin a bind. Without legislative authorization to delay again, she may have to proceed with a sale that could include as many as 40,000 properties with unpaid 2023 taxes. Each certificate sold could add another potential claimant if courts ultimately require counties to return surplus equity to dispossessed owners.\n\u201cEvery tax certificate an Illinois county sells is going to add to the county\u2019s potential liability,\u201d Bob Palmer, policy director of Housing Action Illinois, told the outlet. Matt Kreis, general counsel for the Center for Community Progress, echoed that concern, warning additional March sales could deepen financial exposure down the line.\nThe sale was already pushed from its traditional August date to March 25, 2026, after lawmakers signaled a fix was imminent. That fix never came. By law, owners must be notified 30 days before the auction, meaning notices would need to go out by late February \u2014 or sooner, given the logistics of printing and mailing tens of thousands of certified letters and placing legal ads.\nFOIA documents obtained by the publication show the March sale would cost roughly $190,000 in upfront expenses for printing and publication alone. Meanwhile,\nfederal judges\nin two Illinois districts have\ndeclined to shield\ncounties from liability, though no court has yet determined how past victims of so-called equity theft should be compensated.\nOther Illinois counties are improvising. Rock Island and White counties required tax buyers to sign waivers acknowledging they \u2014 not the county \u2014 would bear responsibility for excess equity claims. Participation held steady and bidding ticked up slightly, suggesting investors may pivot toward interest earnings rather than windfalls from forfeited equity, according to the outlet.\nIn Springfield, Sen. Celina Villanueva introduced legislation that would require counties to return surplus proceeds after taxes are paid. But with the notification deadline days away, Cook County may be forced to proceed under a system the Supreme Court has already called unconstitutional, and hope the bill comes through before lawsuits do.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A mystery sovereign wealth fund is the money behind Carlyle\u2019s blockbuster sale of a\nNew York self-storage portfolio\n,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nUnder the joint venture that acquired the\n15-property package for $1.03 billion\n, Columbia, Missouri-based StorageMart holds a 20 percent stake while the unnamed sovereign wealth fund controls roughly 80 percent, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.\nCarlyle, the seller, will remain involved as asset manager for the sovereign investor. The structure explains why property deeds list Carlyle-affiliated addresses and why a $615 million loan on the portfolio from Kayne Anderson also traces back to the private equity giant.\nThe transaction, first reported by Real Estate Alert, marks the largest\nself-storage deal in New York\nin five years.\nThe roughly 1.3 million-square-foot portfolio totals almost 26,000 storage units and is about 78 percent physically occupied, per REA. Washington, D.C.-based Carlyle assembled the properties over time as part of a broader push into outer-borough storage.\nEastdil Secured brokered the sale, which is the biggest trade in the sector since StorageMart\u2019s $3.2 billion purchase of 18 New York facilities from Edison Properties at the end of 2021, per REA.\nStorageMart will rebrand the newly acquired properties, located in Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan and Staten Island, under its Manhattan Mini Storage banner, according to a press release.\nThe facilities are relatively new, with an average age of four years, and in-place rents average $35.60 per square foot, per REA. Marketing materials suggested that improved management, stronger leasing and the burn-off of concessions could allow a new owner to triple net operating income within four years.\nEastdil declined to comment. Carlyle and StorageMart did not respond to requests for comment.\n",

An investor named Jho Low began buying trophy real estate in Manhattan with the money, though he later surrendered approximately $700 million in assets to the Department of Justice without admitting guilt. \u201cIf Low was 1MDB\u2019s architect, Leissner was its engineer,\u201d one source told the Post.\nLeissner pleaded guilty in 2018 and reported to federal prison this month. He admitted in 2022 that the Beverly Hills home was purchased using $25 million in money stolen from the Malaysian people. Simmons is not alleged to be involved in the fraud.\nIn November 2020, an LLC linked to Leissner sold the property in a distressed refinancing and sale-leaseback deal to entities affiliated with British real estate billionaires David and Simon Reuben. The mansion was never seized, however. The deal required Leissner and Simmons to pay $67,000 per month to remain in the home, but court filings allege no rent has been paid.\nSimmons filed a lawsuit in\nBeverly Hills\ncourt in January 2021 claiming the sale was unauthorized and that her signature on documents approving the handover to the Reuben brothers was procured through \u201cmisrepresentation and abuse of trust.\u201d Cantervale Limited, Chicago Title Company and 25 Beverly Park Circle Propco LLC are listed as cross-plaintiffs and defendants in the case, while Leissner, Simmons and Keyway Pride \u2014 the holding company for the Beverly Hills house \u2014 are cross-defendants and plaintiffs.\nA trial-setting conference in the ongoing case is scheduled for Feb. 25.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A portion of one of Alameda\u2019s biggest malls could be turned into housing near the waterfront.\nMerlone Geier Partners\n, owner of South Shore Center, is in discussions with Alameda officials to build an approximately 400-unit housing development on the southeastern corner of the shopping complex, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The site is currently home to Big 5 Sporting Goods and a car wash.\nThe location is one of two places at South Shore Center where Merlone Geier is looking to erect housing. Together, the two proposed developments could total 800 units. The project is still in its early stages and the company has yet to file an official development application with the city, Merlone Geier managing director Jamas Gwilliam told the Business Times.\nAs part of\nAlameda\n\u2019s state-mandated housing element, the city identified the Big 5 site and another parcel at the shopping center home to\nOfficeMax\nand Southshore Cafe as possible residential development sites to meet its goals. Merlone Geier is also eyeing the OfficeMax site for housing. Total units and building sizes for both locations are yet to be determined, though the firm is targeting roughly 400 units on each parcel, Gwilliam said. That would align with Alameda\u2019s desire to build approximately 800 units at South Shore Center as part of its housing element. If Merlone Geier does move forward with housing at the shopping center, the firm would be required to include some affordable units.\nIt\u2019s not the first time a developer has floated building housing at South Shore Center. In 2019, Atlanta-based Jamestown, which owned the mall before selling it to Merlone Geier in 2020 for an undisclosed price,\nproposed a 1,200-unit housing development\n.\nMerlone Geier is no stranger to building\nresidential developments at retail centers\n. The San Francisco-based firm is currently redeveloping the Northgate Mall in San Rafael into a mixed-use hub with more than 1,400 residences, making it the largest-ever housing development in Marin County.\nUnder its\nhousing element\n, Alameda must plan for 5,353 new homes by 2031.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The expansion follows a recruitment blitz that lured several teams in the last few months, as the Fort Worth area experiences sustained population growth.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been our plan to expand in Fort Worth when it made sense, when the need was there,\u201d said Bryan Pacholski, Compass\u2019 managing director for Dallas/Fort Worth. \u201cWith continued growth in Fort Worth like we\u2019ve had, the need has certainly arisen.\u201d\nWithin the past six months, Compass poached the Dewald Lipari Real Estate Group from Fort Worth independent brokerage League Real Estate; The Urban Group from\nWilliams Trew\n, an Ebby Halliday subsidiary; and Wendy Tockey and Ana Lopez from\nDouglas Elliman\n, Pacholski said.\nCompass sold $844 million in homes in Fort Worth last year, according to the brokerage.\nFort Worth\u2019s luxury residential market benefits from the steady influx of businesses to the Metroplex, albeit to a lesser degree than Dallas, Pacholski said. While\nPark Cities mansions\nare unlikely to slip off the state\u2019s ultra-luxury throne anytime soon,\nluxury estates\nand\nequestrian farms\ngenerate demand as well. The company\u2019s top sale in the Fort Worth area last year was a $13 million ranch, Pacholski said.\nSouthlake\nin Tarrant County also includes\none of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the state\n.\n\u201cYou have Toyota executives that live in Fort Worth. You have Goldman Sachs people that have moved. You\u2019ve got Bell. You\u2019ve got Lockheed Martin,\u201d Pacholski said.\nThe Shops at Clearfork is a mixed-use district west of the city, near suburban Benbrook. The amenity-rich offices have attracted companies as big as\nWells Fargo\nin a flight-to-quality trend away from aging downtown buildings.\n",

        "content": "Rental vouchers are one of the few things on which tenants and landlords agree. Mayor Zohran Mamdani, not so much. And it cost him some bad press.\n\u201cMamdani Reverses Campaign Promise to Expand Rental Assistance\u201d is the kind of\nNew York Times headline\nthat feels like a gut punch to a mayor.\nGothamist had the story\ntwo weeks ago, but its headline was tame (\u201cMamdani delays expansion of NYC housing aid program amid fiscal strain\u201d).\nThe ostensible reason for the decision is that Mamdani has to close a $7 billion budget gap, and can\u2019t add spending to a CityFHEPS program that has already ballooned from $176 million in fiscal 2019 to\n$1.2 billion\nlast year.\nBut one political consultant said there\u2019s probably more to it.\n\u201cThe enormous fiscal aspect is of course a factor in the new mayor\u2019s shift here, but I suspect there\u2019s a deeper underlying ideological reason,\u201d the source emailed me. \u201cThe mayor and\nCea Weaver\nand the like have a default setting of being suspicious and not supportive of any program that addresses affordable housing instability and homelessness through paying landlords.\u201d\nEdited version: \u201cThe mayor and Cea Weaver don\u2019t like paying landlords.\u201d\nIn any case, they can\u2019t pay landlords with money they don\u2019t have. Remember, they cannot raise income taxes. Only the state can. And that is not going to happen this year with Gov. Kathy Hochul facing a Republican challenger.\nBut tax revenue continues to grow even without an increase in rates. Will Mamdani eventually expand CityFHEPS to comply with the law passed by the last City Council? That\u2019s iffy at best.\nRather than fight the City Council\u2019s lawsuit demanding full funding for the expansion, Mamdani is trying to negotiate a settlement with the City Council and the Legal Aid Society.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the money involved, it\u2019s the mechanism and who gets paid,\u201d the source said. \u201cMy thinking is that City Hall has other plans for this crisis. Anything they do in this space is not going to include rent payments.\u201d\nThe Adams administration claimed the CityFHEPS expansion law could cost $17 billion over five years. The City Council insisted it would be less, but would be worth it regardless \u2014 in part because vouchers are cheaper than shelter beds.\nLost in this debate is an inconvenient truth: Rental vouchers don\u2019t create housing. They do the opposite: They increase competition for the available supply. That pushes rents up.\nHomelessness is not just about poverty or mental illness. Many cities have poverty rates like New York\u2019s, but little homelessness because housing is available and inexpensive. Here, the vacancy rate for voucher-eligible units is about 1 percent.\nA family in a shelter or crashing at a relative\u2019s house will take its voucher and go apartment-hunting. The city should ensure it\u2019s building enough homes to offset that increased demand.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nMichael Powell has been a New York City journalist for decades, but in the 1980s he was a tenant organizer in East Flatbush. That gave him a fascinating perspective to write about the struggles of renters and owners of rent-stabilized buildings \u2014 a perspective, he notes, that Mamdani lacks. Powell posted a\nfree link\nto his article. Send your thoughts on it to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Many readers emailed me to say NYCHA\u2019s\n$54,000-per-apartment\ncost to install heat pumps was too high. But one real estate source, whose co-op spent $70,000 per unit to add heat pumps, thought it was too low. NYCHA told me the $38.4 million project included electrical upgrades, window work, radiator removal and more to accommodate 2,137 heat pumps in 712 units, as well as new hot water systems. Alternatives to cure the development\u2019s heating problems would have cost as much or more, a spokesperson said.\nElsewhere\u2026\nThe mayor\u2019s new chief technology officer, computer scientist Lisa Gelobter, led the team that developed the animation technology used to create GIFs. She was also on the Hulu launch team.\nWith\nthose credentials\n, she ought to be able to bring technology to the antiquated, cumbersome HPD violations process.\nI have been gathering anecdotes and opinions on housing violations for a future column. From my discussions with landlords, the process is riddled with inefficiencies \u2014 and more than a little dishonesty.\nGelobter and her team could start by introducing technology to make it easier to clear violations after repairs are made.\nCoordinating city inspectors\u2019 follow-up visits with tenants is a full-time job for some property management employees. Even when they manage to get everyone on the same page, the inspector or the tenant sometimes misses the appointment, and it can be weeks or even months before the stars align again.\nOne landlord suggested that a superintendent could record and upload a video showing the completed repair, with the tenant validating that it was done. An HPD staffer could then clear the violation without ever leaving her desk.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$16.4 million\nfor a 4,962-square-foot, sponsor sale condominium unit at 211 West 84th Street on the Upper West Side. Alexa Lambert, Alison Black and Elizabeth Goss of Compass had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$5.9 million\nfor a bulk sale of sponsor-sale condominium units, storage spaces and parking spots by the Permanent Mission of Canada to the United Nations.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$9.7 million\nfor a 4,592-square-foot, 25-foot-wide townhouse at 37 Garden Place in Brooklyn Heights. Jennifer H. Cooke of Brown Harris Stevens has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permits filed were for a combined project at 680 and 690 East Fordham Road in Belmont. It would be 190 units and 116,822 square feet. Nikolai Katz filed the permit on behalf of Hen Vaknin of Bridge Asset Management.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

It alleges the developer failed to disclose deviations from plans and hasn\u2019t fixed the defects identified by the association and individual unit owners.\nCain International is not named as a defendant.\nIn addition to OKO Group, the association is suing project design firms Asymptote Architecture and Revuelta Architecture International, general contractor Civic Construction and 19 subcontractors.\nDoronin declined to comment, through a spokesperson. The condo association\u2019s lawyer Nicholas Siegfried and executives for the architecture firms and Civic Construction did not respond to requests for comment.

Other alleged problems include lack of hot water in portions of the tower, defective fire alarm devices and fire sprinklers, leaks in the pool plumbing and filtration systems and non-functioning elevators.\nThe condo association of another branded development, the ultra-luxury\nAston Martin Residences\nin downtown Miami, recently sued developer Germ\u00e1n Coto, alleging he siphoned millions of dollars from the owners.",

        "content": "Oak Brook is poised to trade cubicles for shopping carts.\nA developer submitted plans to raze seven aging office buildings along Butterfield Road in the\nvillage\nwest of Chicago and replace them with a 225,000-square-foot Amazon retail store and a 150,000-square-foot, two-story Ashley Furniture flagship. The Chicago Tribune\nreported\nthat the 22-acre site at 2805-2907 Butterfield Road sits along I-88 and marks the latest push to reinvent the village\u2019s struggling office corridor as a retail hub.\nVillage President Larry Herman told the outlet that the Amazon store would be about 40 percent larger than the nearby Costco and would function strictly as a retail operation \u2014 not a distribution warehouse. Amazon is also planning a similar large-format store in Orland Park as it experiments with brick-and-mortar concepts.\nAs part of the deal, the developer would fund a new traffic signal and dedicate land for future westbound I-88 access ramps at Meyers Road, aimed at easing congestion and unlocking further development.\nThe proposal heads next to the Planning and Zoning Commission for a public hearing before returning to the Village Board for final approval. If greenlit, demolition could begin later this year, with construction stretching through 2027.\nOak Brook\ndoes not levy a municipal property tax, meaning sales tax revenue is the village\u2019s primary funding source, and officials expect the\ntwo anchor stores\nto generate several million dollars annually while drawing additional retailers to the Butterfield corridor.\nHerman framed the project as a strategic response to long-term suburban office distress. Several of the seven buildings slated for demolition have been repossessed by lenders, and he said many properties along the\ncorridor\nare unlikely to rebound.\nThe move would also create retail continuity between Oakbrook Center and Yorktown Mall, reinforcing the village\u2019s position as a regional shopping and dining destination, according to the publication. Costco, which recently began a multimillion-dollar expansion, isn\u2019t expected to suffer from the new competition, Herman said, arguing the membership warehouse and Amazon operate on distinct merchandising models.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The Austin Business Journal\nreported\nthat the county did not disclose the sale price.\nThe hulking limestone structure, built in the late 1800s, has been on the market for at least six months.\nCavileer\ntold county officials he spotted the for-sale sign on a Sunday about four months ago and called that day to make an offer.\nWhile plans are still fluid, Cavileer signaled a hospitality heavy vision for the site, potentially blending hotel rooms, restaurant space and other mixed uses.\n\u201cHospitality is in our blood,\u201d he said during the meeting, adding that the historic jail\u2019s\ncharacter\n\u2014 not just the dirt beneath it \u2014 drove the deal.\nCavileer was previously the public face of the redevelopment of the 70-acre Fort Worth Stockyards, a project led by Los Angeles-based Majestic Realty Company that repositioned the district as a retail, dining and entertainment anchor. He departed that venture last year amid a\nlegal dispute\nand launched Delightful Development, which has since surfaced on other projects, including in Florida.\nThe\nGeorgetown\nacquisition would mark a significant adaptive reuse of historic property in one of Central Texas\u2019 fastest-growing cities according to the publication. Georgetown, about 30 miles north of Austin, recently surpassed 100,000 residents and has attracted a wave of corporate investment, including manufacturers and industry groups setting up operations in the region.\nCounty leaders framed the sale as both preservation and opportunity, the outlet reported. Commissioners expressed relief that the building would not be demolished and praised Cavileer\u2019s track record with historic properties.\nThe site\u2019s proximity to the Square \u2014 the cultural and commercial heart of\nGeorgetown\n\u2014 could deepen tourism traffic and extend visitor stays, especially as the city continues to market itself as a Hill Country destination with urban amenities.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "After years in limbo, a troubled state-owned building is changing hands and getting a makeover.\nGov. Kathy Hochul on Friday announced that a nonprofit partnership made up of the Fifth Avenue Committee, Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation and One Brooklyn Health will take over 1024 Fulton Street, a three-story building in Clinton Hill that has sat vacant since the \u201990s.\nThe state will demolish the building to make way for 125 rental units, which will be affordable to those earning between 30 percent and 80 percent of the area median income. The project will also include 27,000 square feet of community center space operated by Fort Greene Council, and a 1,000-square-foot health clinic.\nApex Building Group and Henge Development will handle general contracting and project management. Their financial involvement in the project will be limited to collecting a portion of the developer fee.\nThe $111 million project is expected to be almost entirely financed through low-income tax credits, tax-exempt bonds and public capital subsidy, according to a representative from the governor\u2019s office.\nThe state\u2019s Office of Children and Family Services bought the property in 1997, hoping to develop a community center, but \u201cstructural issues\u201d stood in the way.\nThe building, which was once a showroom for Brooklyn Union Gas, has since sat vacant. The Cuomo administration halted an auction for the site in 2014, after then-Assembly member Walter Mosley urged that the building be transferred to the nonprofit Northeast Brooklyn Housing Development Corp.,\nthe New York Daily News reported at the time\n. That plan fell apart, as did another to\nsell the site\nto a Philadelphia-based company.\nThe latest plan has the state footing the bill for demolishing the 33,000-square-foot structure, for which it previously allocated $3.7 million.\nEmpire State Development issued a request for proposals for the\nsite last year\n, seeking a development team that is at least 51 percent owned by a nonprofit. The development partnership is 100 percent not-for-profit, which gave the team a slight edge in the competition for the site, according to the scoring RFP rubric.\nThe project will next undergo environmental review and then the state\u2019s general project plan process. As part of her executive budget, Hochul proposed reforming the State Environmental Quality Review Act to exempt certain housing projects. Given the project\u2019s parameters, the Fulton Street project could qualify for that exemption if the proposal is ultimately approved.\n",

        "content": "Housing production in Los Angeles is poised to pick up even more as a new adaptive reuse law goes into effect this month.\nThe Citywide Adaptive Reuse Ordinance makes it easier for developers to convert vacant commercial buildings into residences by streamlining approvals and increasing the number of properties eligible for conversion, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n.\nLast month, the Los Angeles City Council voted in favor of the\nCitywide Adaptive Reuse Ordinance\n, which repeals Los Angeles\u2019 existing Adaptive Reuse Incentive Areas Specific Plan, which limited conversions to certain parts of the city including downtown, Chinatown, Hollywood and Koreatown. With the new law, all commercial buildings within Los Angeles city limits can be considered for adaptive reuse.\nThe new regulations also lower the age of the buildings that can be considered for adaptive reuse to structures that are at least 15 years old, down from only allowing conversion at buildings built before 1975. Under the new law, more projects will also be able to receive approval by right, meaning they will be automatically approved if they comply with existing zoning, building codes and land-use regulations.\nJamison Properties\n\u2019s president, Garrett Lee, is leading the way. The Koreatown-based firm is behind the three largest\noffice-to-residential\nprojects in the city to date.\n\u201cThis is monumental for the city,\u201d Lee told the Times of the new ordinance.\nThousands of underutilized commercial structures across the city could be unlocked for housing, Ken Bernstein, a principal city planner in the Los Angeles Department of City Planning, told the Times.\nBy streamlining conversion approvals for projects that meet city guidelines, developers won\u2019t have to estimate how long before they can start construction. \u201cWhen you take that risk off the table, it materially improves the feasibility of conversions,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt addresses both the housing shortage and the long-term office vacancy issue.\u201d\nThere is more than 50 million square feet of vacant office space in Los Angeles, according to the Times. The city\nranks second nationwide\nin adaptive reuse projects with 5,640 apartments in the works, following Manhattan, which has 11,000 such units. In Los Angeles, office-to-residential projects specifically make up a total of 2,843 apartments, or about 50 percent of the city\u2019s adaptive reuse housing pipeline.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The buyer was an LLC managed by\nLinnette Miller and Robert Miller\n, a developer. The property spans 7,600 square feet and has five bedrooms and eight bathrooms. It dates to 1924. Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s\nCarole and Brett Koeppel\nhad the listing, which went live in November for $25 million.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe priciest commercial transaction recorded in the tri-county region was in Palm Beach County, where\nDalfen Industrial\noffloaded a warehouse complex\nat\n1673 and 1715 Meathe Drive\nfor $79.6 million. That\u2019s a 31.4 percent increase from its\n2021 purchase price\nof $60.6 million. The buyer of the Turnpike Logistics Center, comprising a 124,500-square-foot building and another 193,000-square-foot building, was Boston-based\nCabot\n. The latest sale works out to about $251 per square foot.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Todd Wider\n, a plastic surgeon-turned-documentarian, picked up a single-family home at\n9505 Southwest 63rd Court\nin Pinecrest for $10.7 million. The seller was an LLC, managed by\nAlex A. Rogers,\nwhich purchased the home in 2023 for $10.6 million. The five-bedroom mansion spans about 10,200 square feet and sits on a 1.1-acre lot. It has five bedrooms, six full bathrooms, two half baths, a pool, an elevator and fruit trees. The home went on sale in June of last year, for $11.5 million.\nDennis Carvajal\nwith One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty was the seller\u2019s agent, and\nMarilyn Cromer\nwith Douglas Elliman brought the buyer.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Dmitrii Khasanov\n, an investor, and\nEkaterina Khasanova\npurchased a home at\n13225 Arch Creek Terrace\nin North Miami for $7.5 million.

The seller listed the property for sale a little more than a year ago, for $10.8 million.\nDevin Kay\nwith Douglas Elliman had the listing.\nBy the Numbers:\nBuyers have the upper hand in every major metro \u2014 except one\nIf you needed another sign that\nbuyers\nhave the upper hand, here it is: just one of the top 20 metros in the fourth quarter saw homes trade above asking prices.\nThe outlier in the fourth quarter of 2025 was\nSan Francisco\n, where the average sale-to-list ratio in the fourth quarter was 104.7 percent according to an analysis of data from brokerage and research firm Redfin. The firm calculates the ratio by dividing a home\u2019s final price by its last listing price.

        "content": "Eran Polack\u2019s troubled\nHAP Investments\nlost control of three Harlem rental buildings and his firm appears to have shuttered entirely.\nThe commercial real estate lender\nLadder Capital\n, which was owed roughly $69 million, submitted $1 million credit bids for each of the buildings at 2211 Third Avenue, 329 Pleasant Avenue and 2338 Second Avenue at an auction last month. The trio of multifamily properties was part of HAP\u2019s once-ambitious push into Upper Manhattan. The foreclosure sale was first reported by\nPincusCo\n.\nThe foreclosure adds to the mounting troubles for HAP. Hundreds of Israeli investors lost a collective $70 million after Madison Realty Capital seized control in 2024 of the developer\u2019s failed HAP Seven condominium project at 4452 Broadway in Washington Heights. HAP founders Nir Amsel, Amir Hasid and Polack later informed investors that the property was officially transferred to Madison following Chapter 11 proceedings in state court, according to Ynetnews.\nNow HAP\u2019s website appears to be down and the phone number affiliated with the business has been disconnected. All of the New York properties listed on its website in November appear to have been sold or lost to foreclosure.\nA few years ago, HAP was marketing the three Harlem rentals \u2014 along with another property \u2014 for a combined $130 million. In 2019, listing broker James Nelson of Avison Young said most of the portfolio\u2019s 171 newly built apartments were free-market units. Two of the buildings include affordable housing, while the 30-unit property at 2338 Second Avenue was slated to receive a 421a tax abatement upon completion.\nThe debt dates back to a $64 million loan originated in December 2021 by Allegiant Capital Funding and later assigned to an entity tied to Ladder. The lender moved to foreclose in 2024, alleging the loan had gone into default with $60.9 million in unpaid principal, plus interest.\nIn its state Supreme Court complaint, the lender said Polack and an affiliated entity are listed as guarantors and could face recourse for certain losses.\nIn addition to HAP\u2019s website and phone being down, Polack now lists himself as CEO of HAP Construction on LinkedIn. He did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Attorneys for Ladder also did not respond.\n",

The firm filed an application with the Department of City Planning on Wednesday.\nCharney filed permits for the project in 2023, planning a 40-story building with 161,000 square feet of total space. The authorization application calls for another 10 stories and approximately 50 additional units, along with nearly 34,000 square feet of extra space.\nIf approved, the project would extend roughly 53 stories tall with more than 200 condos.\nThe city would be getting a benefit from the authorization, as Charney would make improvements to the nearby Nevins Street subway station, which serves four different transit lines. The developer would privately fund the upgrades \u2014 including improved accessibility and capacity \u2014 though it did not provide an expected cost.\nThe developer acquired the site\nnear the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the Downtown Brooklyn Whole Foods in 2023.

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s housing market has a new distinction, and it\u2019s not one brokers will love to tout.\nWhile homebuying became more affordable over the past year in most of the country\u2019s biggest metros, Chicago moved in the opposite direction. Buyers in the region needed 3.5 percent more income in December to afford a median-priced home than they did a year earlier, according to a\nreport\nissued Wednesday by Redfin. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat in eight of the nation\u2019s 10 largest metro areas, required income dropped during the same period.\nThe biggest affordability boost came in Dallas, where buyers needed 7.4 percent less income, year-over-year. Nationwide, the income required to buy the median-priced home fell 4 percent \u2014 a 7.5 percentage point swing compared to Chicago\u2019s decline.\nThe culprit is Chicago\u2019s\nrelative steadiness\n. Unlike pandemic boomtowns such as Phoenix, where prices skyrocketed and are now giving back gains, Chicago saw slower, steadier appreciation, according to the report.\n\u201cThe reason Chicago was getting more expensive in 2025 is that it didn\u2019t get too expensive during the pandemic,\u201d Redfin chief economist Daryl Fairweather told the outlet, contrasting the city with markets that overheated in 2021 and 2022.\nAt the peak of the boom in early 2022, Chicago home prices were up roughly 10 percent, year-over-year. Phoenix\u2019s were rising at about triple that pace. Now Phoenix buyers have seen affordability improve by 3.7 percent, nearly the inverse of\nChicago\u2019s slide\n.\nLocal agents say the squeeze feels persistent. Ryan Gable of StartingPoint Realty told the outlet that affordability \u201chas not gotten better in years.\u201d Uran Kabashi of Fulton Grace Realty pointed to the double bind of elevated mortgage rates and thin inventory, compounded by broader inflation eating into buyers\u2019 budgets.\nAmong the 50 metros Redfin tracked, only Detroit saw a slightly larger drop in affordability, with buyers needing 3.6 percent more income, year-over-year.\nEven so, Chicago remains\ncomparatively attainable\n. The median home price in Dallas tops $377,000, versus just under $349,000 in Chicago. And while buying\npower improved\nin coastal markets such as Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego, households there still need more than $230,000 in income to afford a median-priced home \u2014 more than double the $105,440 required in the Chicago area.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Blackhawk Plaza in Danville is facing escalating financial distress as its primary lender, Preferred Bank, has filed two loan default notices totaling $31 million, according to Contra Costa County records.\nThe defaults come on top of a separate $5 million loan from Nano Banc, placing the retail center under simultaneous foreclosure pressure from two creditors, the\nSan Jose Mercury News reported\n. The mounting delinquencies underscore a deteriorating capital structure for a property already struggling with declining tenancy and operational challenges.\nThe financing history reveals an increasingly leveraged position. Ramanujan Group, run by real estate financier Deba Shyam, acquired the plaza in 2020 for $28.3 million, immediately supported by a $28 million loan from Preferred Bank. The lender extended an additional $3 million in 2023, while Nano Banc provided $5 million in 2024. The combined $36 million\nin debt exceeds the acquisition price by 27 percent, indicating aggressive leverage relative to asset value and raising questions about underwriting assumptions, cash\u2011flow performance and the borrower\u2019s ability to service obligations.\nOperationally, the property has experienced weakening fundamentals. Key tenants, including Draeger\u2019s Market, have closed, and a planned Apple Cinemas lease never materialized after the prior theater operator exited in 2022. Reduced occupancy and declining foot traffic likely impaired net operating income, constraining the borrower\u2019s capacity to meet debt\u2011service requirements, according to the Mercury News.\nCompounding the financial strain, a coalition of commercial property owners \u2014 including the Blackhawk Automotive and Cultural Museum \u2014 has filed a lawsuit alleging severe deferred maintenance. The complaint cites \u201cever-widening cracks and potholes in parking lots, decrepit and non-functioning light stanchions, rusted and broken staircase railings, crumbling stairs, broken and inoperable irrigation pipes, unclean water, and dangerous erosion of soil.\u201d It also lists \u201copen and live wiring,\u201d conditions that could further depress asset value and complicate any refinancing or sale. Ramanujan Group has denied the allegations, but litigation adds another layer of risk for lenders and stakeholders.\nThe plaza\u2019s challenges are amplified by its geographic position, which experts note is disadvantaged by its distance from Interstate 680, limiting regional draw.\nHowever, Danville ranks as one of the\nwealthiest cities\nin the Bay Area, with an average home price north of $2 million. It has hosted a number of celebrity residents including David DeWalt, the\nformer CEO of McAfee\n, and Ken Behring,\nformer owner\nof the NFL\u2019s Seattle Seahawks. Blackhawk Plaza, once marketed as a premium open\u2011air center with Mediterranean architecture and landscaped water features, would seem a good fit, but the property now faces a convergence of loan defaults, operational decline, tenant attrition and legal disputes.\n\u2014 Joel Russell\n",

It will add roughly 70,000 new residents to the city of The Woodlands at full buildout, according to the website for The Woodlands-based developer, Howard Hughes Corporation. Currently about 50,000 people live within the community.\nThe deal, approved unanimously by county commissioners, would anchor 22 acres of the district with the Texans\u2019 headquarters, including indoor training facilities and outdoor practice fields, the Houston Chronicle\nreported\n.\nThe broader Toro District will blend retail, restaurants, hotel, entertainment and commercial space within Bridgeland Central, the emerging downtown of the community.\nFinancial details\nremain murky.\nHarris County Judge Lina Hidalgo\nsaid the county\u2019s proposed contribution would total $150 million, largely earmarked for\ninfrastructure upgrades\n, and funded through a tax increment reinvestment zone. Under that structure, a portion of property tax growth generated within the zone would be reinvested there rather than flow to the county\u2019s general fund.\nThe Texans\nwill participate in the development through an affiliate and plan to break ground later this year, targeting a 2029 opening. The team currently practices at the Houston Methodist Training Center near NRG Stadium.\nHoward Hughes CEO David O\u2019Reilly framed the project as more than a sports complex, calling it \u201ca statement about where Houston is going.\u201d The company \u2014 parent of Howard Hughes Holdings \u2014 also developed The Woodlands and controls 118,000 acres nationally, with 10 million square feet of office and retail space across five states, according to Bisnow.\nToro District is projected to generate $34 billion in long-term economic impact and create more than 17,000 jobs regionally, according to project backers.

        "content": "California Attorney General Rob Bonta has launched a civil rights investigation into Los Angeles County\u2019s emergency response to the\nEaton fire in Altadena\n, introducing significant regulatory and legal exposure for county agencies.\nThe probe centers on whether race, age or disability discrimination contributed to delayed evacuation alerts and\nlimited firefighting resources\nin west Altadena, a historically Black enclave that suffered disproportionate losses, the\nLos Angeles Times reported\n. Nearly all of the fire\u2019s 19 fatalities occurred in that neighborhood, and residents have argued that systemic failures in alerts and resource deployment directly contributed to the devastation.\nThe investigation follows extensive reporting by the Times that documents stark disparities between west and east Altadena. While eastern neighborhoods received evacuation orders within an hour of ignition, west Altadena residents waited up to nine hours for alerts \u2014 some areas nearly 12 hours \u2014 despite multiple 911 calls and visible fire activity.\nA Times analysis also found that most fire crews remained east of Lake Avenue even as the fire shifted west. These operational gaps raise questions about emergency\u2011management protocols, resource allocation and whether structural inequities influenced decision\u2011making during the disaster.\nBonta has previously charged real estate agents with price-gouging\nin the aftermath of disasters\n, but civil rights law represents a new avenue. From a governance perspective, L.A. County agencies, including the Fire Department, Sheriff\u2019s Department, and Office of Emergency Management, now face a multi\u2011layered review process: Bonta\u2019s civil rights probe, an independent state\u2011ordered investigation by the Fire Safety Research Institute and a separate audit by the California State Auditor.\nWhile county officials assert that responders acted appropriately under extreme conditions, the attorney general\u2019s office is uniquely positioned to evaluate potential \u201cdisparate\u2011impact liability\u201d \u2014 an assessment that does not require proof of intent.\nCleanup of the Eaton fire is\nessentially complete\n, but the rebuild\nhas lagged\n.\nPolitical groups, particularly Altadena for Accountability, view the investigation as a breakthrough in establishing precedent for civil rights oversight in disaster response. Advocates argue that climate\u2011related emergencies increasingly expose vulnerable populations to disproportionate harm, and that the Eaton fire illustrates the financial and institutional costs of inequitable preparedness.\nThe outcome of the probe could influence future emergency\u2011response standards statewide. Bonta noted that the goal is corrective.\n\u201cOur main focus is to make sure that whatever happened here won\u2019t ever happen again,\u201d he said.\n\u2014 Joel Russell\n",

Taylor-based E3 Agriculture plans to build up to seven homes using crop-based construction materials as part of a 14-home development along Main Street, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe project is a partnership with Liberty3D and will mark E3\u2019s first full-scale homebuilding. While the company has supplied materials to local efforts such as Community First Village, founder and CEO Lucas Evans said this is the first time it will take the reins on delivering an entire home.\n\u201cWe\u2019re wanting to take it on ourselves to do a production home that would be affordable, simple and efficient to build,\u201d Evans told the outlet.\nUp to 80 percent of each house\u2019s materials are expected to come from E3\u2019s hemp crops. Insulation, drywall and other components will be\nplant-based\n, with the exception of roofs, foundations and interior studs. Two homes are already underway and are slated for completion this fall, with\nprices capped\nat $320,000. E3 may develop as many as five additional lots, according to the publication.\nRockdale has a population 5,637 as of 2024 Census estimates, and sits between Austin and College Station. The former Alcoa site is being repositioned as a 33,000-acre, multi-company campus that already hosts\nbitcoin mining operations\ndue to its proximity to large transmission infrastructure. Liberty3D CEO Jason Jones said interest in the area has \u201cblown up\u201d over the past two years.\nAs Austin-area builders search for ways to rein in costs, Evans said hemp could become a viable alternative. Initial construction costs in Rockdale will likely mirror those of conventional builds, he said, but pairing sustainable materials with 3D printing technology could eventually \u201cdramatically bring down the cost of raw materials.\u201d\nThere are performance perks, too. Hemp-based materials are naturally fire-resistant and carbon-conscious, a selling point as insurers and municipalities scrutinize climate risk, according to Evans.\nE3 is already eyeing expansion, with multifamily hemp projects in the works in Austin and San Antonio.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The southern penthouse at\n70 Vestry\nhas lived many lives.\nIt served as the backdrop to a Netflix reality show. Later, it became entangled in a divorce between the show\u2019s star and her now ex-husband.\nNow it has a new claim, as one of downtown\u2019s most expensive condos after trading for $57 million on Friday, according to public records.\nThe final number falls short of the recent new record set by financier Harsh Padia\u2019s condo at\n150 Charles\n, which sold for $60 million last summer.\nThe penthouse at 70 Vestry was listed for $65 million in November after the seller, reality star Julia Haart,\nwon the home\nafter a messy three-year divorce from Italian entrepreneur Silvio Scaglia.\nModlin Group\u2019s Adam Modlin had the listing.\nScaglia bought the apartment for\n$55 million in 2018\n. He appeared as Haart\u2019s estranged husband during the second season of Netflix\u2019s \u201cMy Unorthodox Life,\u201d which showed Haart and her children living in New York City after leaving an Orthodox Jewish community in the Hudson Valley.\nThe massive penthouse also made an appearance. Spanning 7,800 square feet, the 16-room condo covers three floors and has a private elevator, two chef\u2019s kitchens, five bedrooms and five full bathrooms. It also has more than 3,600 square feet of terrace.\nHaart landed the condo after a judge granted her a default judgment in the divorce at the start of last year.\nWhile the proceedings were ongoing, the home\nrented for $125,000\nin 2022.\nThe sale is downtown\u2019s latest big deal after a number of developments along the West Side have attracted wealthy buyers for condos asking well beyond the recent record closings.\nIn December, a buyer at Zeckendorf Development and Atlas Capital Group\u2019s 80 Clarkson agreed to pay\n$129 million for multiple units\n. The deal has yet to close, while a penthouse at Aurora Capital\u2019s 140 Jane Street asking\n$87.5 million\nfound a buyer last summer.\n",

        "content": "Federal prosecutors have charged four individuals in a fraud scheme that resulted in the bogus sale of a Burbank home for $1.5 million, with neither the legitimate homeowner nor the purported buyer aware of the transaction.\nAccording to a federal complaint, the group \u2014 which included licensed real estate broker Glenis Cardona, along with Ivan Reyes, Arshak Akopyan and fugitive Basil Tikriti \u2014 used forged signatures, falsified loan applications and fabricated identities to orchestrate the scam, the\nLos Angeles Times reported\n. Three of the suspects were arrested on Feb. 11.\nThe scheme centered on securing nearly $1 million from a mortgage loan.\nAfter the sale closed in January 2024, Cardona received a $60,000 wire transfer, which she quickly spent on big-money retail purchases and on a new car.\nThe fraud came to light when employees at third\u2011party entities handling loan disbursements flagged suspicious wire activity. One gold\u2011purchasing business became alarmed when a caller attempted to pick up gold using the homeowner\u2019s phone number, but with a different name. The title company also raised concerns, prompting further scrutiny.\nFederal investigators uncovered evidence while examining WhatsApp and Signal messages tied to a separate mortgage\u2011fraud case. A cooperating witness provided access to communications in which the defendants discussed property targets, access logistics and even the need to recruit impostors to pose as elderly buyers and sellers before a notary.\nTikriti, who has prior convictions for identity theft and grand theft, joked about using gray hair spray and a cane to age an accomplice.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have old 65 yr old guys at my disposal to play ball,\u201d a message from Tikriti stated, according to the Times. \u201cI\u2019m not a casting director.\u201d\nBurbank Police had already opened an investigation after the real homeowner reported that his property had been sold without his knowledge. The supposed buyer later told police they were unaware of the purchase and were suddenly responsible for a $975,000 mortgage.\nMortgage fraud is nothing new \u2014 alleged culprits range from New York Attorney General\nLetitia James\nto Texas Attorney General\nKen Paxton\n\u2014 but usually one of the parties is involved in the scam. One convicted fraudster\ndescribed it\nas \u201ca drug.\u201d\nThe defendants face up to 30 years in federal prison if convicted.\n\u2014 Joel Russell\n",

It\u2019s a move that would expand its Chicago presence and shift its local office from River North to the Loop. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat the firm currently occupies less than 40,000 square feet in the 321 North Clark Street building.\nIf finalized, the lease would mark the latest vote of confidence from the\nlegal sector\nin a downtown office market still grappling with elevated vacancy, the outlet reported. While some of Chicago\u2019s largest firms have trimmed space in recent years, a cadre of small and mid-sized practices have moved the other way.\nChicago-based\nCroke Fairchild Duarte &amp; Beres\n, Cleveland-based Benesch Friedlander Coplan &amp; Aronoff and Chicago\u2019s\nGoldman Ismail Tomaselli Brennan &amp; Baum\nhave all inked deals for\nlarger downtown offices\nover the past year.\nA spokesperson for Loeb &amp; Loeb told Crain\u2019s the firm is \u201cevaluating all of our options for office space and have made no final decisions.\u201d JLL is representing the tenant in negotiations, while Stream Realty Partners oversees leasing at the Franklin Street tower.\nThe 35-story, 807,000-square-foot building is owned by a venture of Morgan Stanley and has proved relatively resilient, according to the publication. Even as anchor tenants CNA Financial and Meta have sought to shed chunks of space on the sublease market, the property has attracted new tenants. Shamrock Trading recently subleased a floor from CNA, and Vermillion Development signed for nearly 16,000 square feet.\nA Loeb &amp; Loeb departure would add pressure at the building at 321 North Clark Street. The 896,502-square-foot tower is now controlled by Nuveen, which\ntook over the building\nin December to resolve a troubled loan. The building is about 78 percent leased, according to CoStar Group, and recently lost another major tenant when CBRE relocated to the building at 300 North LaSalle Drive.\nLoeb &amp; Loeb launched its Chicago office in 2003 with six intellectual property attorneys and has since grown to roughly 80 attorneys and staff locally.

        "content": "Menlo Equities will abandon its previously approved plans for a 400,000\u2011square\u2011foot office and life sciences campus in Sunnyvale and will pivot to a large\u2011scale data center on the site.\nThe decision reflects the accelerating preference in Silicon Valley for artificial intelligence\u2011driven infrastructure, the\nSan Francisco Business Times reported\n. The revised plan cuts the original office footprint by roughly 200,000 square feet and replaces the multibuilding research and design concept with a single two\u2011story data center and an adjacent Pacific Gas and Electric Company substation to support the project\u2019s substantial power requirements.\nThe shift aligns with surging demand for\ndata\u2011center capacity\nas AI companies and cloud providers race to secure power\u2011dense facilities. Across the region, developers are shelving traditional office projects in favor of data centers capable of supporting AI workloads, which require significantly more electricity and cooling than conventional enterprise computing.\nMenlo Equities, run by Rick Holmstrom from its headquarters in Menlo Park, first entered the data\u2011center sector in 2025 through its Menlo Digital platform, partnering with NRG Energy to develop 350 megawatts of capacity across Northern Virginia, Silicon Valley and Dallas, with delivery expected between 2027 and 2028. The Sunnyvale project, located at 888\u2013894 Ross Drive in Peery Park, is now confirmed as one of those sites. The company has secured 49 megawatts of power \u2014 enough to supply more than 10,000 homes \u2014 positioning the property as a high\u2011capacity AI\u2011oriented facility.\nThe developer\nacquired\nthe 9\u2011acre site for $88.5 million in 2022 and initially proposed two, four\u2011story office buildings and a six\u2011level parking structure. The firm hired RMW Architects &amp; Interiors, RHAA Landscape Architects and Newmark\u2019s Joe Kelly and Mike Saign for the original concept. However, by early 2026, filings show the company had taken out a $20 million loan from Northern Trust and secured a redevelopment permit valued at $23.43 million, along with an entitlement extension through November 2026 \u2014 steps consistent with advancing a data\u2011center project.\nThe site\u2019s industrial zoning further supports the decision, as such zoning is typical for data\u2011center development. Menlo Equities already owns another\nSunnyvale data center\nat 444 Toyama Drive, purchased from Digital Realty in 2021.\nThe Sunnyvale project joins more than 30 new data\u2011center developments underway in California as Amazon.com, Microsoft, CloudHQ, Edgecore and others compete to build capacity.\n\u2014 Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "Adam Neumann is fast becoming persona non-grata in El Portal, the small village in northeast Miami-Dade County where he wants to erase an old church to make way for his wife\u2019s private school.\nAt a town hall Thursday, a procession of village residents bashed Neumann, who was not in attendance, and two owner representatives for SOLFL School, who hosted the event.\nFour days earlier, crews began tearing down the Rader Memorial United Methodist Church at 205 Northeast 87th Street, which\nNeumann\npurchased 11 months ago for $13.7 million. The price was more than $8 million above the previous sale price in 2021. While the 1950s building is not a historic landmark, the church has stood as the village\u2019s signature property for nearly 75 years.\nEl Portal residents said they were blindsided by the demolition, fueling their suspicions that Neumann and SOLFL representatives are going to plow ahead with redeveloping the property without their input.\nThe name is an acronym for Student of Life, For Life, a holistic Jewish school founded by\nRebekah Neumann\nthat operates a Montessori-style, Torah-centered learning environment, according to SOLFL\u2019s website.\nNeumann did not respond to email requesting comment.\nRoughly 100 people attended the town hall, and several spoke with condemnation.\n\u201cWhen you tore down the church, you punched us in the face,\u201d said Denise White, a resident who spoke at the town hall. \u201cRight now, you\u2019re acting overlordy, not neighborly.\u201d\nIt was the first of two community meetings mandated by El Portal Village Council after its members delayed voting on zoning changes that would allow the school on the church property.\nSOLFL is a rebranding of\nWeGrow\n, a school started by the Neumanns as an off-shoot of\nWeWork\n, the co-working firm previously helmed by Adam Neumann. He stepped down as CEO in 2019 under pressure from WeWork\u2019s board of directors and investors after a botched attempt to take the company public.\nIn December and January, SOLFL representatives presented the vision for the new campus, which consists of two-story Tiki hut-style buildings and an eight-foot wall surrounding the property\u2019s perimeter. The structure would be built using 3-D printing technology. The proposed campus would teach a maximum of 350 students from kindergarten to 12th grade.\nDemolition of the church is in SOLFL\u2019s site plan and other documents submitted to the village, but school representatives did not disclose that a teardown permit was obtained in November and that the teardown would begin before the town hall, videos of the city council meetings show.\nSOLFL representative Jeffrey Davis said the demolition work could not be paused. \u201cIt has to be cleared,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is completely unsafe.\u201d\nResidents said keeping them in the dark about the demolition reinforced their lack of trust.\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t transparent at the last meeting,\u201d said Calixto Navarro Acosta. \u201cThere are ulterior motives and nefarious motives here. We are not dealing with a clean slate.\u201d\nSOLFL is seeking village council approval for a site plan, an amendment to El Portal\u2019s comprehensive master plan and a special exception for 2.1 acres that includes the church property and a neighboring single family house and vacant lot, which was part of the $13.7 million acquisition.\nNeumann purchased the church property from an affiliate of Miami-based Elm Springs, which paid\n$5.5 million\nfor the site five years ago, and had previously planned on converting the building into office, retail and restaurant spaces.\nOver the summer, SOLFL explored renovating the church into a school, but had to pivot to new construction because it is less expensive, Davis said.\nThe school is one of two projects Neumann is planning in El Portal.\nLast year, Neumann\u2019s Miami-based multifamily development firm Flow and Canada Global bought a 16-acre former mobile home park in El Portal for\n$71.5 million\nafter winning a courthouse auction for the site. The joint venture is planning a mixed-use project with 2,380-plus apartments, but plans have not been disclosed.",

        "content": "Highbridge Equity Partners has defaulted on another downtown Oakland office property, adding to a growing list of distressed assets in the foreclosure pipeline.\nJPMorgan Chase has filed a complaint in Alameda County Superior Court seeking to foreclose on 1540\u20131544 Broadway, a multitenant building in the East Bay city\u2019s core, after Highbridge failed to repay a $2.7 million loan tied to the property, the\nSan Francisco Business Times reported\n. The borrower stopped making payments in June 2025 and still owes $2.3 million as of February 2026, according to court filings.\nThe building sits adjacent to 1500 Broadway, one of three Highbridge-owned office towers \u2014 along with the Tribune Tower and the Financial Center Building \u2014 that entered foreclosure in 2025 and were placed in receivership. At the time, the receiver reported severe deterioration across the portfolio, including broken windows, asbestos, drug paraphernalia and other hazardous conditions.\nThe new foreclosure indicates that Highbridge\u2019s broader Oakland strategy, once built on acquiring and repositioning historic assets, has largely collapsed under debt pressure and deferred maintenance.\nHighbridge, run by CEO Douglas Abrams, purchased 1540\u20131544 Broadway for $6 million in 2018 and financed it with a loan from First Republic Bank, whose assets JPMorgan later acquired.\nThe lawsuit also names Thomas Beers, producer of the television show \u201cDeadliest Catch,\u201d and his wife Leslie Beers as guarantors. The Beers invested in the Tribune Tower and could be held liable for repayment, according to the Business Times.\nJPMorgan is seeking a court\u2011appointed receiver to stabilize operations and potentially prepare the Broadway property for sale.\nThe building has long served as an arts and cultural venue, most recently housing the Black Arts Movement Business District Community Development Corporation and the Lower Bottom Playaz theater company.\nHighbridge\u2019s troubles extend beyond Broadway. Between 2016 and 2018, the firm spent more than $117 million acquiring the Tribune Tower, Financial Center Building and 1500 Broadway, later refinancing the portfolio with a $111 million loan. That debt also went into default in 2025, prompting lender Rialto Capital Management to\ntake control\nthrough receivership. The firm additionally owns The Loom, a 5\u2011acre East Oakland redevelopment site with an uncertain future.\nThe context of Highbridge troubles is Oakland\u2019s weakened post\u2011pandemic office market, where vacancies have surged and\ndistressed assets\nare trading at steep discounts. Multiple buildings have already been\nseized by lenders\nor sold at fractions of prior valuations, signaling a deep market reset.\n\u2014 Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "Ken Griffin isn\u2019t waiting around for 2030.\nThe Citadel founder\nopted\nthis week to accelerate his bet on 350 Park Avenue, electing to take a 60 percent stake in the joint venture developing the 2 million-square-foot tower rather than wait for his original deadline to either buy the site outright or assume control later. The move reshuffles the balance of power between Griffin and his partners, Vornado Realty Trust and Rudin Management, while speeding up one of Midtown\u2019s most closely watched office projects.\nUnder a 2022 agreement, Griffin had until June 2030 to either acquire a majority stake in the venture or purchase the site for $1.4 billion, which would have sidelined Vornado and Rudin from the development. Instead, he chose in December to lock in the 60 percent position now, according to comments from Vornado president Michael Franco during the REIT\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call.\nThe decision also amends the original ownership split. Vornado and Rudin have until July to secure between 23 percent and 40 percent of the joint venture, with Vornado\u2019s share ranging from 21 percent to 36 percent. Previously, Vornado was slated for 36 percent and Rudin 4 percent. Demolition is expected to begin in April following City Council approval of the rezoning and permit filings late last year.\nCitadel, the anchor tenant, previously committed to 850,000 square feet, but Vornado executives signaled that footprint could grow. CEO Steve Roth said the hedge fund is still finalizing its space needs, while Franco noted interest from tenants with leases expiring between 2031 and 2033 seeking as little as 50,000 square feet.\nThe accelerated timeline is a vote of confidence in a top-tier Park Avenue product at a moment when much of the office market remains bifurcated. Griffin is doubling down on trophy space as other landlords retrench, a high-stakes wager that demand for best-in-class offices will outpace broader market malaise.\nIt\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day weekend, which means it\u2019s time to turn down the lights, pour a glass of pinot noir and snuggle up to your loved one while reading the week\u2019s most important New York stories from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nWaldorf Astoria hits market after eight-year condo conversion\nDajia Insurance Group, a state-run Chinese firm, plans to sell the historic Waldorf Astoria property in Manhattan.\nA lengthy renovation reduced the hotel portion to 375 rooms and created 372 condominium units, which would be sold separately, though the overall property sale will include adjoining restaurants and retail sites.\nThe project, which launched in 2017, faced major disruptions, including the seizure of the original developer, Anbang Insurance Group, by the Chinese government.\nManocherian Brothers float resi conversion despite Midtown South carveout\nThe City Council\u2019s Midtown South rezoning carved out 37 Garment District properties, including a building at 257 West 39th Street, to preserve the area\u2019s \u201cunique cluster of businesses.\u201d\nDespite this exclusion, the owner of 257 West 39th Street is pursuing a site-specific zoning change to allow for a partial residential conversion of the commercial building.\nThe Garment District Alliance opposed the carveout, citing a nearly 30 percent vacancy rate in the excluded properties and arguing that the city is needlessly preventing housing and growth in an area well-served by transit.\nJonathan Miller and Douglas Elliman break up data partnership after 32 years\nAppraiser Jonathan Miller\u2019s 32-year relationship with Douglas Elliman has come to a close, with the final market report under the partnership published on Thursday.\nMiller, who heads Miller Samuel appraisal firm and is an adjunct professor at Columbia, is shifting his focus to a new neighborhood-level housing index venture called StreetMatrix.\nLaunched with economist Nick Huntington-Klein, the venture offers market performance data down to bedroom count and neighborhood, aiming to provide a more granular view than traditional city-wide housing indexes.\nTech took Manhattan office leases by storm in January\nJanuary was a good month for tech companies, going by the number of leases they signed within the five boroughs of New York City. Of the top ten office leases in January, four of them were for tech companies and two of those were for AI platforms.\n\u201cMy very wealthy Russians\u201d: Insider brokers\u2019 frenzy to access Epstein\u2019s townhouse\nAnd finally, Jeffrey Epstein tightly controlled access to his Upper East Side townhouse, arbitrarily rejecting offers and expressing suspicion about potential buyers.\nEmails show brokers attempted to gain entry by name-dropping ultra-wealthy individuals, often without success and in some cases using the names as bait.\nEpstein never sold the property while alive, seeking exorbitant prices (claiming to have rejected offers up to $250 million) and turning down a $125 million offer around 2010, indicating he was likely averse to selling.\n",

The seller was reality star Julia Haart, and the buyer was a trust. The 7,800-square-foot condo went on the market in November for $65 million. Italian entrepreneur Silvio Scaglia, Haart\u2019s ex-husband,\nhad purchased the pad\n, which also has 3,600 square feet of terrace, in 2018 for $55 million. Modlin Group\u2019s Adam Modlin had the listing.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nSoho had the top commercial deal recorded in the city. A six-story building at\n158 Lafayette Street\ntraded for $15.3 million. The seller was an LLC tied to New York-based\nWaterfall Asset Management\n, which took over the property in 2024 amid a foreclosure case, and the buyer was\nLink Real Estate\n, which on its website notes the 27,500-square-foot building will be converted into a co-working property with ground-floor retail.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nSocialit\nShafi Roepers\nparted with a co-op at\n4 East 66th Street\nin the Upper East Side for $28 million, about a decade after the unit first went on the market for $65 million. The buyer was a trust. The full-floor pad has a private elevator landing, five bedrooms, eight bathrooms and views of Central Park. Brown Harris Stevens\u2019\nMary Fitzgibbons\nand\nMartha Kramer\nhad the listing.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nBusinesswoman\nSegolene Frere-Gallienne\n, daughter of late billionaire Albert Frere, paid $7.2 million for an Upper East Side pad at\n50 East 77th Street\n. The sellers were\nDavid and Marcia Kaplan,\nwho had owned the unit since 2010, when they purchased it for $4.7 million. It has three bedrooms and three and a half bathrooms.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Mustafa Mete Karakaye\nand\nNeslihan Karakaye\npurchased a condo at\n200 Amsterdam Avenue\nin Lincoln Square for $7.1 million. The seller,\nVincent329 LLC\n, paid $7.3 million for the unit in 2021. The unit measures about 2,900 square feet and has four bedrooms and four and a half baths. Compass\u2019\nTania Isacoff Friedland\nand\nAlli Chiaramonte\nhad the listing, and\nLynne Samone Mazin\n, also with Compass, brought the buyer.\nBy the Numbers:\nMortgage delinquencies tick up as affordability strains homeowners\nThe U.S. affordability crisis is continuing to take a toll on homeowners, an increasing share of whom are missing their mortgage payments.\nIn the fourth quarter, the share of delinquent mortgages ticked up 28 basis points year over year and 27 basis points quarter over quarter to reach 4.26 percent, according to the\nMortgage Bankers Association\n. While more homeowners are falling behind on payments, the rate of loans starting the\nforeclosure\nprocess held relatively steady compared to the quarter and year before, at about 0.2 percent.\nMississippi had the highest 90-day delinquency rate, of 2.66 percent, and the highest 30-day delinquency rate, of 3.98 percent. Both rates increased the most quarter over quarter in the country, by 26 basis points (90 days) and by 44 basis points (30 days).\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "Humberto Lopes heard the opening bell, drew his fists and posted a profanity-laden TikTok urging landlords to stop paying their property taxes.\n\u201cLet\u2019s start not paying the property tax for this quarter coming up. We\u2019ll fucking bankrupt this city!\u201d he shouted in the video posted on\nTuesday\n. \u201cThe minute we don\u2019t pay your property tax, New York City will fucking crumble.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t foreclose on all of us,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhen you destroy us, we can destroy the fucking city,\u201d he concluded.\nIn the video, Lopes holds up a poster released by the Mamdani administration this week announcing dates for five \u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings, where tenants are invited to speak out about their experiences renting in the city. The image featured the text \u201cNew Yorkers vs. Bad Landlords,\u201d\nevoking\na boxing match.\nLandlord groups were not amused by the imagery.\n\u201cFraming his \u2018rental ripoff\u2019 hearings as a prize fight between tenants vs. landlords makes it disturbingly clear that this new mayor\u2019s housing policies are going to be driven by marquee-like politics, circus-like slogans, and us-versus-them divisiveness,\u201d Ann Korchak, board president of the Small Property Owners of New York, said in a statement.\n\u201cShow trials may make good theater, but they don\u2019t solve problems,\u201d Anthony Burgos, CEO\u00a0 of the New York Apartment Association, said in a statement.\nLopes echoed these sentiments, but with more f-bombs.\n\u201cWhat do you think you are going to accomplish that HPD didn\u2019t accomplish?\u201d he asked, clutching the poster, referring to the city\u2019s Department of Housing Preservation and Development.\nHe also questioned why the administration isn\u2019t including NYCHA in the hearings. (Public Advocate Jumaane Williams called out the city\u2019s public housing authority last month as the city\u2019s true worst landlord, though it didn\u2019t make his official list.)\nWhen asked on Friday, Lopes said he is in earnest about urging owners to withhold property taxes, comparing it to when tenants stop paying rent to force landlords to make repairs. He said he\u2019s consulting with attorneys about following through with the threat.\nHow many others would follow him in such a protest is unclear. Korchak said that while small property owners are \u201cfrustrated with the anti-landlord vitriol,\u201d withholding property tax payments \u201cwould bring greater financial harm and distress\u201d to owners. She thinks a more constructive route is pushing the state to amend the 2019 rent laws.\nLopes heads H.L. Dynasty, which owns and operates 1.2 million square feet of real estate in New York and Florida, according to the company\u2019s website. Lopes recently launched a landlord group, dubbed Gotham Housing Alliance, inspired by his longtime love of Batman (in videos, Batman figurines can be seen on his desk, and in at least one video, a life-sized Caped Crusader statue appears in the background). Lopes noted in a call Friday that Batman\u2019s M.O. is to bring the \u201ccity back to normal.\u201d\nThe video features a bombastic style seen in his other videos on social media, where he speaks directly to the camera. Lopes has griped about other city policies in these videos, including the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act, or COPA.\n\u201cIf a poster about \u2018bad landlords\u2019 strikes a nerve, it\u2019s worth asking why. Our focus isn\u2019t on rhetoric \u2014 it\u2019s on results,\u201d a City Hall spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re eager to partner with anyone who\u2019s committed to providing safe, stable homes and helping us build a city that everyday New Yorkers can actually afford.\u201d\nTenant advocates say the \u201crental ripoff\u201d video proves the need for the hearings.\n\u201cHit dogs holler,\u201d Charlie Dulik, director of tenant organizing at Housing Conservation Coordinators, said. \u201cHis rage about tenants being offered a simple chance to speak about the conditions they endure shows exactly why these hearings are necessary.\u201d\nThe first hearing is slated for Feb. 26 in Downtown Brooklyn. As one of his first acts as mayor, Zohran Mamdani signed an executive order establishing the hearings to give tenants the opportunity to speak about \u201cabusive, deceptive, or unconscionable landlord practices.\u201d The executive order lists property managers and landlords as potential speakers as well.\nWithin 90 days of the final hearing, scheduled for April 7, city agencies must issue a joint report outlining common themes raised during the hearings and recommending policy and other changes to address them.\n",

        "content": "Related Urban\n, BH Group and Tezral Partners won initial approval to build an apartment complex with two 20-story towers on city-owned land in Riviera Beach.\nThe 418-unit project at\nMarina Village\nwas given the green light from the village\u2019s planning and zoning board Thursday, but its members recommended adding workforce housing to the mix.\nThe project, called Gallery at Marina Village, is slated for 2.45 acres surrounded by Broadway, East 12\nth\nStreet, Avenue C, and West 13\nth\nStreet. The proposal is headed to\nRiviera Beach\nCity Council for a final vote.\nThe Related Group\u2019s affordable housing arm, Miami-based Related Urban Development Group, is partnering with Aventura-based\nBH Group\nand West Palm Beach-based Tezral Partners on the project.\nIt will consist of 190 two-bedrooms, 152 one-bedrooms, 38 three-bedrooms, and 38 studios as well as 3,000 square feet of retail and 3,000 square feet of office. Amenities include an 1,800-square-foot fitness center, an 1,800-square-foot coworking space and a ground floor pool deck.\nA nine-level parking garage is planned with 652 spaces, about 25 percent fewer than the 863 spaces required under city code.\nThe development site is next to Residences at Marina Village,\nan eight-story, 149-unit\naffordable and workforce housing project that Related Urban and Tezral Partners have under construction. That project is close to topping off and will be finished in the fall, Related Urban president Albert Milo told the board.\nBoth developments are elements of Riviera Beach\u2019s Marina Village Master Plan, a 2013 concept designed to bring economic development to a 90-acre area by the waterfront owned by the city and its community redevelopment agency. It consists of a marina and an event space with an outdoor restaurant.\nThe complex that\u2019s under construction includes affordable and workforce housing, but the proposed development was designed as a market-rate project.\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean a workforce person can\u2019t reside in the Gallery at Marina Village, but the market will dictate what the rents will be,\u201d Milo told the board.\nRents are expected to cost $2,500 to $4,000 a month, he said.\nFrank Fernandez, the board\u2019s vice chair, pressed for workforce units to be part of this project.\nMilo said he had no objections to that since workforce housing units only need to be affordable for households earning 120 percent of the area median income. In Palm Beach County, that is about $98,000 a year, an amount that is expected to grow to $108,000 in May, Milo told the board.\nRelated Urban is one of three development teams that submitted bids to build on 12 acres of Marina Village near the waterfront as part of the city\u2019s master plan.\nThe overall master plan includes 224 condo units, 120 hotel rooms, 10 three-story condos, waterfront retail and a parking garage with a soccer field and tennis and pickleball courts.\nRelated Urban\u2019s proposal will face off against Forest Development\u2019s offer to build a convention center of at least 320,000 square feet, along with 270 hotel rooms and 164 condo units, as well as Sonnenblick Development\u2019s plans to construct a mixed-use project that will include a\nMargaritaville Hotel\nand 270 residential units.",

        "content": "A power duo on Los Angeles\u2019 Eastside cleaned up this week with a couple of closings, despite more \u201csensitive\u201d conditions for the area\u2019s high end.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019\nJonathan Mogharrabi and Marci Kays\n, who count the actor Brad Pitt among their clients, double ended the sale of Fear of God designer\nJerry Lorenzo\n\u2019s Los Feliz home for $8.6 million, or $1,197 per square foot. The deal on the property at 2401 Nottingham Avenue officially closed on Wednesday.\nIt\u2019s the priciest deal to close in Los Feliz since June\u2019s $13.5 million trade of 4533 Cockerham Drive, which sold for $675 per square foot.\nMogharrabi and Kays, who co-listed the property with Plus Real Estate\u2019s Tyrone McKillen, represented the local family that purchased the home.\nLorenzo and his wife, Desiree Manuel, paid $8.5 million for the Nottingham Avenue residence, making the decision to list it after they purchased and moved their family to 9051 Briarcrest Lane in Beverly Hills Post Office for $19.5 million in 2023.\nAfter the closing of Lorenzo\u2019s home, Kays and Mogharrabi capped the work week with the closing of 2720 Glendower Avenue, also in Los Feliz, and also double ended by the high-end agents.\nThe 1920s, Spanish Colonial style home closed for nearly $7.4 million.\nProperty records indicate the seller was a shell company tied to registered agents with a Sacramento address.\nMarket dynamics\nMogharrabi called the Eastside\u2019s high-end market a \u201cmix.\u201d\n\u201cI think some of the properties are just being priced too high, but more than pricing it\u2019s just strategy on how to put these deals together now with the market being more sensitive on the Eastside,\u201d he said.\nProperties priced over $7 million in places such as Los Feliz and Silver Lake require careful strategy. That goes beyond simply factoring in\nMeasure United to House L.A.\n, which Mogharrabi said the market\u2019s generally accepted as part of buying and selling real estate in Los Angeles.\nThe\ntwo-tier tax\napplies a 4 percent levy on city of Los Angeles real estate deals starting at $5.3 million and kicks up to 5.5 percent on trades starting at $10.6 million.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about the market being slow, but there are plenty of buyers looking in this price point and we\u2019ve noticed a pickup for us personally with a lot of our inventory,\u201d he said.\nThat\u2019s a finer distinction that holds across the greater Los Angeles\u2019s high-end market. And, to that point, Mogharrabi said his and Kays\u2019 listing at 7141 Senalda Road in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Outpost Estates just went into escrow. The 1930s-built home counts six beds and seven baths and is asking just under $9 million, or $1,333 per square foot.\nOutpost Estates is the same historic community where Kays and Mogharrabi represented Pitt last August in the actor\u2019s\n$12 million purchase\nof a residence in the area known for its Spanish and Mediterranean designs. They followed up that deal the next month with their representation of Pitt in the off-market sale of his Los Feliz\nMid-Century Modern\nhome, known as\nThe Steel House\n. The property had been listed for $5.5 million, sources told\nThe Real Deal\nat the time of the closing.\n",

        "content": "The site of several demolished properties in Hollywood will become a 33-unit apartment complex from local developer Rom Investments.\nBased on an application submitted to the Los Angeles Department of City Planning, the apartments would rise at 1845 North Taft Avenue, at the corner of Franklin Avenue and north of the 101 freeway,\nUrbanize Los Angeles reported\n. The six-story building would include one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments above non-required parking for 48 vehicles.\nCategory Design Group is the architect on the project, and Alchemy Planning &amp; Land Use is working with the developer. A rendering shows a modern block-style structure in a podium configuration.\nRom Investments, run by Leeor Maciborski and his wife Orly Maciborski, has requested development incentives through the Citywide Housing Incentive Program to build a larger structure than otherwise allowed by zoning rules. The project would bring a mid-rise building to a neighborhood of shorter homes and structures. To qualify for the zoning exemption, Rom would rent four of the units as affordable housing for extremely-low-income tenants.\nROM Investments focuses on \u201ccurating,\u201d via acquisition or development, \u201cunique living spaces\u201d in Los Angeles, particularly the Hollywood market. The company has filed plans for an\n131-unit\napartment complex\nnear the Hollywood/Western Metro stop. It would include 74 studios, 49 one-bedroom apartments and eight two-bedrooms.\nLike the Taft Avenue project, the larger project at 5242 East Carlton Way in East Hollywood involved the demolition of older structures \u2014 in this case, two small multifamily buildings \u2014 and their replacement with a new 138,894-square-foot one.\nThe developer also has a Transit Oriented Communities project at 1807-1809 North Van Ness Avenue in Hollywood. The project replaces a 111-year-old house with five residential units, consisting of two duplexes and one single-family home.\nHollywood has emerged as a hotbed for apartment projects, with recent proposals from\nUncommon Developers\nin Chatsworth and\nKimco Realty\n.\n\u2014\nJoel Russell\n",

        "content": "Fulton Market\njust took a major step in its transformation from meatpacking plants to a lifestyle hub for trendy office workers and tourists.\nShanna Collective and\nFulton Street Companies\nannounced that fashion designer Rick Owens will open his first store in Chicago at The Fulton, the developers\u2019\nmixed-use project at 910 West Lake Street\nwhere\nCoca-Cola is set to open a large office\non the building\u2019s upper floors that are being refinished as part of the development.\nRick Owens\u2019 2,832-square-foot retail store will be the Paris-based brand\u2019s fourth location in the U.S. and its first in Chicago. While the square footage is modest compared to the massive office leases that define the neighborhood, the deal signals a pivotal shift for the corridor.\nFulton Street Companies, led by Ross Babel and Alex Najem, has pushed to transform the fast-growing office hub and hot residential area into a\nhigh-end shopping destination\n. While brands like Lululemon and Anthropologie have planted flags, the arrival of Rick Owens \u2014 known for gothic minimalism and brutalist aesthetics \u2014 marks the first ultra-luxury brand to set up shop in Fulton Market.\n\u201cRick Owens embodies uncompromising creativity and cultural relevance,\u201d said Shanna Khan, CEO of Shanna Collective and the project\u2019s chief design officer. \u201cWelcoming a world-renowned, avant-garde designer such as Rick Owens creates a platform for bold expression in fashion and the arts.\u201d\nThe retail lease was brokered by Francis X. Scire, Jr., head of retail leasing for The Fulton, in collaboration with Khan. Fulton Street Companies tapped Scire in January to lead its leasing operations and bring in high-end clients. Najem said it was especially enjoyable to witness Owens\u2019 wife, designer Mich\u00e8le Lamy, walk the brand\u2019s new space with Khan and come up with ideas for its eventual presentation and opening.\nRick Owens was represented by Newmark\u2019s Andrew Turf, Jonathan Schley, Aubrie Pettersen and Aubrey Hinkson in collaboration with Chicago-based Canvas Real Estate\u2019s Anthony Campagni and Elan Rasansky.\nThe store will be located within The Fulton, a 535,000-square-foot development that involved the adaptive reuse of the historic Schwinn bicycle factory on Lake Street and the more than $230 million construction of an adjacent 12-story office building immediately to the north on 919 West Fulton Street.\nThe new construction project broke ground in 2023 \u2014 one of the few office developments to do so amid a high-interest rate environment \u2014 and recently completed work, with ongoing interior buildouts for high-end fitness tenant Equinix as well as a Gibson\u2019s restaurant.\nFulton Street Companies has been one of the most active developers in the neighborhood, betting that the area can sustain premium rents despite broader headwinds in the commercial sector. Its 919 West Fulton Street hosts Harrison Street Real Estate as its anchor office tenant, which recently moved its workforce into the building. Najem and Khan\u2019s firms purchased the Lake Street Lofts building next door, where Rick Owens is leasing, for $49 million in 2023.\n",

        "content": "Illinois lawmakers are gearing up to take another swing at one of the most closely watched insurance overhauls in years, reviving a bill that would give state regulators new authority to curb homeowners premium hikes.\nThe push comes after Bloomington, Illinois-based State Farm raised Illinois homeowners rates an average of\n27.2 percent last year\n, citing mounting weather-related losses. Capitol News Illinois\nreported\nthat Gov. JB Pritzker\nseized on the increase\nto call for tighter oversight, arguing insurers shouldn\u2019t be able to shift the cost of disasters in places like California and Florida onto Illinois property owners. In December,\nAllstate announced\nthat it plans an average 8.8 percent hike in Illinois homeowners insurance premiums starting Feb. 24, affecting over 209,000 policyholders, as previously reported in\nThe Real Deal\n.\nA measure granting the Illinois Department of Insurance authority to review and reject excessive rate increases cleared the Senate during the fall veto session, but fell four votes short in the House. Many assumed it was dead, but chief House sponsor Rep. Robyn Gabel refiled a motion to concur, according to the publication, teeing up a potential second vote as the General Assembly returns to Springfield for the 2026 session.\nIndustry groups say they\u2019re bracing for round two. Kevin Martin, executive director of the Illinois Insurance Association, told the outlet that insurers have heard the bill could be called as early as next week.\nAt the heart of the fight is\nIllinois\u2019 status\nas a \u201cuse-and-file\u201d state, allowing insurers to implement new rates immediately and submit them to regulators afterward. Supporters of the bill note Illinois is the only state that lacks a law explicitly barring \u201cexcessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory\u201d premiums and does not require prior approval of rate changes, according to the publication.\nThe proposal would keep the use-and-file framework, but empower regulators to review rates after they take effect and order refunds if they\u2019re found to violate state standards. It would also require 60 days\u2019 notice for hikes of 10 percent or more and mandate the use of Illinois-specific loss data to prevent so-called cost-shifting.\nInsurers argue the measure goes too far, particularly because it sets no time limit on how far back regulators could look when reviewing rates, according to the outlet. They also reject the allegation that out-of-state losses are baked into Illinois premiums.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Wall Street may be spooked by artificial intelligence. CBRE\u2019s chief isn\u2019t.\nShares of CBRE plunged nearly 9 percent Thursday to close at $136, capping a two-day, 20 percent slide \u2014 the company\u2019s steepest drop since 2020 \u2014 as investors fretted that rapid advances in AI could erode demand for office space and disrupt brokerage models. The stock slid again early Friday before rebounding more than 5 percent by midday, Bloomberg\nreported\n. Its shares closed on Friday at $142, up 4.4 percent from Thursday\u2019s close.\nThe selloff rippled across the sector. JLL fell 7.6 percent and\nNewmark dropped\nmore than 4 percent on Thursday, as what analysts dubbed the latest \u201cAI scare trade\u201d spread from brokerages to real estate investment trusts.\nOn an earnings call on Thursday, CBRE CEO Bob Sulentic struck a markedly different tone. The Dallas-based firm\u2019s work, he argued, is too complex to be automated away, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t get our brokerage leads online somewhere,\u201d Sulentic said, pointing to the \u201cdeep knowledge\u201d brokers cultivate with occupiers and investors. Strategic advice on major transactions and oversight of global development projects, he suggested, are not easily replicated by code.\nIf anything, AI is proving additive. Sulentic said\nCBRE rolled out\ninternal AI tools to arm brokers with data more efficiently and at lower cost. And the technology is fueling one of the firm\u2019s fastest-growing businesses: data centers.\nCBRE reported record 2025 revenue of $40.6 billion, up 13 percent, year-over-year, with fourth-quarter revenue rising 12 percent to $11.6 billion. Net income for the year climbed nearly 20 percent to about $1.2 billion. Core earnings per share of $2.73 beat Wall Street estimates.\nData center and digital infrastructure work accounted for roughly 14 percent of CBRE\u2019s pre-tax earnings in 2025, Sulentic said. The firm expects revenue from its data center business to hit $2 billion in 2026, growing at a 20 percent annual clip.\nCBRE has been\nbulking up\naccordingly.

        "content": "Anti-poverty advocates are using some tricky math to push back on the \u201cabundance\u201d movement as a solution to housing affordability.\nA new\nreport\nby the Center on Poverty and Inequality at Georgetown Law School says that in markets where developers built a lot of housing, rents for low-income units went up more than for other units. The researchers got their study featured in a\nNew York Times\narticle.\nBut the actual rent increases might have been smaller than the report made them seem, and in the context of rising expenses, they should surprise absolutely no one.\nNor are they an argument against adding robustly to housing supply. The researchers, to their credit, don\u2019t reject the abundance strategy. But they do suggest that abundance doesn\u2019t help low-income tenants.\nI agree that very poor people need more than ample supply, because their incomes aren\u2019t enough to sustain any kind of decent housing. That is, they need income support such as rental vouchers.\nBut they also need an ample supply of housing to accommodate people who out-earn them. Otherwise they will be competing with them \u2014 a losing proposition.\nMy first bone to pick with the report is its title: \u201cAbundance for Who?\u201d That\u2019s like fingernails on a chalkboard for me. Would it have killed them to say \u201cAbundance for Whom?\u201d\nThen I took a close look at the\nLinkedIn post\nby Lelaine Bigelow, the executive director of the center behind the study:\n\u201cFor years, the narrative has been simple: just build more housing and prices will come down. But our analysis of six high-growth metros shows it\u2019s not that straightforward.\n\u201cTake Phoenix. The city built aggressively. New units had a vacancy rate over 9%. Yet rents for extremely low-income households jumped 26.7% while rents for high-income households actually fell by 5.3%.\u201d\nThe alleged increase was over eight years, from 2015 to 2023. And the \u201chigh-income\u201d statistic Bigelow cited actually included moderate- and middle-income households. These groups make up the majority of renters.\nThat\u2019s the first reason the study\u2019s numbers are \u2014 to borrow Bigelow\u2019s phrase \u2014 \u201cnot that straightforward.\u201d\nThe bigger reason is that researchers adjusted for inflation not by using the general Consumer Price Index but by using CPI for local rents for the metropolitan area in question.\nStay with me here, people. Math concept ahead!\nRent inflation across the Phoenix market was very low, perhaps even negative, from 2015 to 2023, thanks to aggressive building for moderate- to upper-income families.\nBut that rent inflation makes even modest nominal increases in rents paid by extremely low-income households (earning $30,000 or less) look very large \u2014 in this case, 26.7 percent.\n\u201cIf you told Class C/D operators in Phoenix their rents were up 26.7 percent over that period, they would look at you like you were crazy,\u201d housing economist Jay Parsons\ncommented\nbelow Bigelow\u2019s post.\nLet\u2019s review:\nPhoenix built like crazy, resulting in a real (inflation-adjusted) drop in rents for most households. That\u2019s a clear win for housing affordability.\nBut because so many rents fell, if your household\u2019s rent went up, the relative increase is going to be a big percentage jump.\nAnd why did rents increase for the cheapest units?\nLisa Gomez, CEO of the big New York City real estate firm L &amp; M Development Partners,\nanswered that question\n:\n\u201cIt\u2019s as much about operating expenses as it is about supply,\u201d Gomez wrote on LinkedIn. \u201cEvery area has its own operating economics and you have to have corresponding income to cover them.\u201d\nOwners of the cheapest rental housing are far more sensitive to those increases than at the high end. Those landlords must either raise rents to cover their costs or shutter the unit (which would remove it from the data).\nUnfortunately, the study did not compare rent increases to the increases in operating costs, such as for utilities, insurance, property taxes and maintenance. But they were probably\nlower\n.\nThe bottom line is: in markets with housing abundance, most rents stayed down because of competition. Because operating costs rose, the lowest-income tenants saw rents increase relative to higher earners\u2019 rents. And without abundance to absorb demand for housing, their rents would have gone up a lot more.\n\u201cWe need to do A LOT more to help low-income families access safe, quality housing (more subsidized housing, vouchers, etc.),\u201d Parsons\nwrote\n, \u201cbut simply demanding we build less market rate wouldn\u2019t provide any material boost to these families because those projects aren\u2019t gonna pencil out at the rent levels needed.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The show might have seemed to be over in the Live Music Capital of the World, but there may be an encore.\nAustin drew crowds in the early 2020s as any concerns over the pandemic were more than offset by cheap mortgages, the\ntech industry\u2019s\ninterest in the Lone Star state and remote workers trading\ntight coastal homes for roomier styles\n.\nBy the end of 2025, the bandwagon was long gone. Apartments built for the next wave of festivalgoers met with sparse demand, leading to\nvacancy rates almost double the national average of 8.6 percent\nand\nthe greatest decline in average rent of any of the top 50 metros in the country\nin January. Redfin found this month that\nfour out of five homes in Austin sold below their original listing price last year\n, the biggest share of any major metro in the state and one of the biggest in the country. Even the high end felt the chill: the prestigious Tarrytown neighborhood saw its home values decline year-over-year at a greater rate than any other ZIP code in Austin in 2025, with\naverage sale prices dropping 11 percent\nfrom $1.7 million in 2024 to $1.5 million last year. One high-volume resi team,\nTrinity Texas Realty\n, resorted to hospitality to fill the gap of lower home sales.\nBut loyal Austin fans aren\u2019t leaving the show just yet.\nA closer look at the data reveals persistent demand for Austin apartments, centrally located homes and certain luxury neighborhoods. Austin absorbed 3,177 multifamily units in the fourth quarter of 2025, trailing only New York City, Dallas/Fort Worth, Phoenix and Atlanta nationwide, according to CoStar. Those units represent a hundredth of Austin\u2019s entire multifamily inventory, putting Austin in second place nationally for the strongest absorption as a percentage of supply, trailing Charlotte.\nMeanwhile, the multifamily pipeline has slowed dramatically. CoStar projects a 47 percent decline in unit deliveries this year.\nOn the single-family side, most of the depreciation in the area has taken place in\nexurbs\nlike Round Rock, Kyle and Georgetown, one of the fastest-growing cities in the country three years ago.\nSale prices in Austin city limits generally held flat\n.\nSimilarly, prices in certain luxury enclaves also changed little. The average home sale price wobbled by just one percent between 2024 and 2025 in Westlake, and it actually rose marginally in Downtown.\nOf course,\na vast portion of Austin luxury deals go unrecorded on the Multiple Listing Service\n, obscuring the full picture of top-tier resi trends. The city\u2019s always been a hotspot for hidden gigs, after all.\nCourtroom drama\nColony Ridge \u2014 the Houston-area master-planned community that\u2019s been taking lumps left and right, politically \u2014 received another blow this week.\nSettling a federal lawsuit begun in 2023, the developers of Colony Ridge\nagreed\nto invest $48 million in infrastructure improvements and $20 million in law enforcement support.\nThe Biden administration alleged in the original suit that Colony Ridge targeted Hispanic buyers with deceptive advertising and predatory mortgages. Republican leaders floated suspicions that Colony Ridge was facilitating cartel crime and \u201c\nallowing illegal aliens to run rampant on its streets\n,\u201d according to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.\nDowntown divestiture for Nate Paul?\nMeanwhile, Paxton associate\nNate Paul may soon give up two Downtown Austin properties\n. A court-appointed receiver is negotiating sales of the 0.9-acre warehouse lot at 99 Trinity Street and a three-parcel assemblage near the Austonian condo tower at 201 and 203 Colorado Street.\nTrades and spades in the office sector\nDeals were struck and shovels sunk in the office market recently. McKinley Homes\nbought\nSam Houston Crossing I, a distressed building at 10343 Sam Houston Park Drive in Houston, in December. The Gutow Company\npurchased\nthe 13-story property formerly known as the Atlas Energy Tower at 12001 North Central Expressway in Dallas and disclosed plans to rename it 12001 NCX. Nearby, Hall Group\nbroke ground\nFriday on a $140 million office building in Hall Park, the company\u2019s ongoing development just south of The Star in Frisco.\n",

        "content": "Parking lots can be the most vanilla of commercial real estate assets, but they can be spicy when they\u2019re at the center of a complaint about an alleged conspiracy.\nCriscione Meyer Entitlement, which owns six downtown Los Angeles surface parking lots that total about 69,000 square feet, has sued three parking entities \u2014 all of which appear to be sister companies connected to Richard Ulemann Sr. \u2014\u00a0 over a loan dispute involving said lots near L.A. Live off the 110 Freeway, and have entitlements for redevelopment as affordable residential.\nHere are the twists and turns:\nPlaintiff Criscione Meyer Entitlement (CME) purchased the six parcels from defendant 110 West Properties out of bankruptcy for $22 million five years ago. The purchase price was paid via a loan obtained by CME in the amount of $10 million and secured by a deed of trust. The remaining $12 million was paid via a promissory note payable to the seller, 110 West, and secured by a second deed of trust. Then, CME became a landlord to 110 West, and later to defendants Shamrock Parking and Classic Parking, which the complaint calls \u201cco-conspirators\u201d and \u201calter egos\u201d of Ulemann.\nSome time passed, some extensions on the debt was granted, and CME eventually negotiated a deal to pay off that $12 million loan for just $500,000, per the complaint. CME claims 110 West accepted the $500,000 payoff in writing but then sold its $12 million note on the property to Classic Parking. Classic Parking then refused to honor the $500,000 payoff agreement.\nCME alleges this was a breach of contract and part of a coordinated effort to block the refinancing of five parcels and a sale of one to an electric vehicle fast charging company for about $11 million. (CME accused the lessees and defendants of illegally occupying the space because their lease is up and they owe rent, too).\n\u201cEach of them, knowingly and willfully conspired and agreed to cause financial hardship to CME by inducing 110 West to breach its discounted payoff agreement with CME and instead assign the $12 million note to Classic Parking,\u201d the complaint reads. \u201cDefendants, and each of them, furthered the conspiracy and lent aid and encouragement by directing 110 West to repudiate the discounted payoff agreement with CME and instead sell the $12 million note to Classic, thereby aiding and abetting the tortious interference with CME\u2019s contractual rights.\u201d\nThe complaint continues: \u201cThe conduct of defendants in conspiring was, and is, fraudulent, oppressive and malicious.\u201d\nCME wants the court to force defendants to accept $500,000 and release the $12 million deed of trust, keep them from foreclosing while the case is pending and evict them. It also is seeking $5 million in damages.\nThe attorney for the plaintiff and a representative for the three related parking entities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nWhat we know beyond the litigation is that CME has been trying to sell the parking lots for years. The real estate came on the\nmarket\nin Aug. 2023 with an ask of $23 million. A source familiar with the matter said the parcels will trade for less.\nOne of the parcels is in contract and the others are in negotiations, per Patrick Sharples, a broker with Keller Williams via G&amp;S Group, who holds the offering. They could all close later this year, but it\u2019s unclear whether litigation will influence an outcome.\nThe real estate can be redeveloped and, because they\u2019re near L.A. Live, there\u2019s potential for apartments or a hotel. But neither pencil out, according to Sharples. He said he has talked with developers because the parcels are eligible for ED1, an emergency order by Mayor Karen Bass that streamlines the approval process for developments that are 100 percent deed-restricted affordable housing. The numbers didn\u2019t make sense, he said. When it comes to a hotel, the lots aren\u2019t zoned for that, so nothing would be completed before the World Cup or Olympics.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the lots won\u2019t eventually be redeveloped, but they may stay just parking lots for a bit.\nHamlet-esque\nOceanwide Plaza creditors are having their \u201cto be or not to be\u201d moment. After a federal bankruptcy judge greenlit a settlement ending a lender-versus-lender war, creditors have a\nchoice\n: Make their own or joint credit bids and attempt to complete the stalled mega-development or sell it off in hopes of recouping their losses, a person with knowledge of the matter told\nThe Real Deal\n. That decision is imminent, the source said. LA Downtown Investment, funded via EB-5 investors, and Lendlease, the one-time general contractor, are the two major parties. We\u2019ll see if they persist or ditch.\nKilroy trims exposure\nKilroy Realty reported\nearnings\nearlier this week, and a lot of chatter was about a big buy and sale in San Diego, but let\u2019s take a look at Los Angeles. Chief Executive Angela Aman, on the fourth-quarter earnings call, said Los Angeles is where the real estate investment trust has completed most of its portfolio modification after selling 501 Santa Monica and Sunset Media Center in the heart of Hollywood, and buying Maple Plaza in Beverly Hills, which is still one of her best talking points to date. Going forward, however, expect more action as it rejiggers in L.A., where Kilroy still is facing a little more than 400,000 square feet in lease expiration this year.\n",

Both sites were once the home of Long Island College Hospital, which Rockrose has now pieced back together.\nAn entity tied to LICH and SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University sold Rockrose the most recent site, which covers 363 Hicks Street, 365 Hicks Street, 97 Amity Street and 340 Henry Street. Newmark\u2019s Dan O\u2019Brien and Jimmy Kuhn brokered the sale.\nMadison Realty Capital owned the other site at 91-95 Pacific Street. The lender had bought it from Fortis Property Group after the developer\u2019s plans for the parcels failed to materialize and it faced foreclosure on its $48 million loan.\nFortis seemed to have bought first and planned second.\nIts initial rezoning vision was shot down by then-City Council member Brad Lander, who was looking for more affordable housing and community benefits than Fortis seemed equipped to provide. Meanwhile, the developer became locked up in a lawsuit with SUNY over what the college claims was Fortis\u2019 failure to close on a second part of the deal that would have served as a medical campus for New York University.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Rockrose may not need to pursue a rezoning and has now pieced together a prime stretch of real estate for a multi-family development. It also successfully navigated the New York State Attorney General\u2019s office, which had to approve the purchase, given the non-profit involved in the sale.\nWhile the deals don\u2019t quite amount to adaptive reuse, they show that there\u2019s still plenty of prime real estate for developers who know what to do with it.\nNow if only there was a new plan for that\nleaning tower in FiDi\n\u2026\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: Home sales in January were disappointing and one economist blamed it on the weather. New York has been a tundra as of late, but if somebody\u2019s going to buy a house, is an extra layer really going to stop them? Let me know if I\u2019m wrong by emailing me at\njacob.indursky@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: In the mood for love? Head to the most loveless place on earth, Times Square, where you can watch two engagements and two actual wedding ceremonies on\nValentine\u2019s Day\n. Nothing says romance like a life-size Elmo pointing at his watch because a new couple needs to get married.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 The online prediction market Polymarket launched its free grocery store on Thursday, Curbed\nreported\n. The store is only open through Sunday and stocked with Kirkland-brand olive oil and milk that seemed to have been purchased by a nearby Aldi. One shopper told the outlet they spent 11 hours in line for $120 worth of free groceries.\n\u2014 A Long Island town issued a three-month ban on new pickleball courts, Newsday\nreported\n. Glen Cove\u2019s City Council voted unanimously to prevent residents from putting new courts on their property, mostly to quell complaints about noise. But the courts aren\u2019t gone forever. The local law was put in place so that the city can undertake a \u201cthorough examination of the impacts playing pickleball may pose to city residents.\u201d\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$57 million\nfor 70 Vestry Street, PHS.

        "content": "Chikoo Patel and Shai Wolkowicki have once again drawn the wrath of Old National Bank, as the investors face at least the second foreclosure from the lender as their own infighting rages on in multiple court battles.\nOld National Bank filed a foreclosure\nlawsuit this week targeting a mixed-use multifamily and retail property suited for ground-floor medical or dental office space at 316-324 Lake Street in Oak Park, according to public records.\nThe bank alleges that the duo, operating through Halsted South Partners, LLC, defaulted on a debt totaling approximately $2.32 million. According to the complaint, the borrowers failed to make monthly installments starting in November 2025, prompting the lender to accelerate the debt and seek a receiver to take over the property\u2019s management while the court case plays out.\nThe Oak Park filing is just the latest headache for\nPatel and Wolkowicki\n, whose partnership has dissolved into a thicket of litigation and allegations of financial misconduct. Old National is already pursuing a $16 million foreclosure against the pair for a larger multifamily property downstate in Springfield, a case that remains pending in court.\nThe broader collapse began with the implosion of Patel\u2019s firm, CKO Real Estate, which fashioned itself as an experienced property manager prepared to operate South and West Side multifamily buildings in challenging Chicago neighborhoods. It raised money from people who said they depended on CKO to handle repairs, rent collection and working with tenants in affordable housing programs funded by state and federal sources.\nBut multiple investors \u2014 including Wolkowicki and his wife Lauren Lampert, who have Chicago roots but now live in Boca Raton, Florida \u2014 have sued Patel, alleging he misappropriated or \u201cstole\u201d roughly millions of dollars from various businesses. Wolkwowicki and Lampert specifically claim Patel wasted over $10 million in investment capital by mismanaging properties and siphoning funds away from business operations into his own personal accounts.\nThe unraveling has also caught the attention of corporate creditors; American Express recently sued Patel for unpaid credit card debt of more than $63,000 as his firm\u2019s portfolio faced a wave of building code violations and habitability complaints from tenants.\nWolkowicki didn\u2019t return requests for comment and Patel and an attorney for Patel didn\u2019t return requests for comment. Patel\u2019s lawyer has previously said his client denies Wolkowicki\u2019s allegations.\nWhile the two were once frequent collaborators, Wolkowicki has another once-productive relationship that has soured into a legal civil war. Last year, Wolkowicki\nfiled a separate lawsuit pitting him against Mitch Goltz\n, the former partner in their old firm GW Properties, which has been selling off real estate throughout Chicagoland to wind down.\nGoltz, who now heads the firm GTZ Development, declined to comment on the dispute with Wolkowicki, which centers around how Goltz handled the distribution of proceeds from last year\u2019s\n$31 million sale of the Church Street Plaza\nproperty in Evanston. Goltz reiterated a separate\nforeclosure suit he and Wolkowicki are facing on a LaGrange property\nthat remains in the GW portfolio, filed by a venture of Chicago real estate firm Wolcott Group, and is still in the process of being resolved through new financing.\nWhile Wolkowicki deals with the fallout of his distressed multifamily holdings, Goltz is pivoting toward big redevelopment further west into the suburbs. GTZ is in talks to bring an\nAmazon large-store retail format and an Ashley Furniture store\nto an office campus in Oak Brook that his firm\nacquired at a deep discount out of distress\n. The seven office buildings on the property may be torn down to make way for the retailers.\nHowever, legal and financial pressures mark a downturn for Wolkowicki, who previously made headlines for reasons outside of real estate. In 2014, he was a victim in a boating accident on Lake Michigan that killed three of his friends, leaving him stranded on the water only to be discovered the next day. He was the sole survivor who was aboard the watercraft, whose fractional ownership company, insurers and repair company agreed in 2018 to a $27.9 million settlement with Wolkowicki and the estates of the other victims.\nThe next court date in the lawsuit Wolkowicki brought against Patel is scheduled for a March 9 hearing.\n",

        "content": "While the headlines in post-Super Bowl San Francisco were taken up by an extended teachers\u2019 strike that kept children out of school all week, Mayor Daniel Lurie \u2014 whose own frustrations with the strike fed the news cycle \u2014 quietly signed what could end up as one of the most impactful pieces of housing legislation in his tenure.\nOn Thursday, Lurie formally established a new public financing program he hopes will incentivize the conversion of the old office buildings of San Francisco\u2019s urban core into housing. The so-called Downtown Revitalization Financing District will direct increases in property tax revenue toward annual incentive payments for eligible conversion projects. The district\u2019s boundaries include the Financial District, Union Square, and parts of the Market Corridor and SOMA.\nSan Francisco rose as the poster child for the pandemic\u2019s decimation of America\u2019s traditional central business districts. Cities across the country concluded that a resilient downtown meant a transition from a strictly commercial center into a more mixed-use neighborhood. Thus, converting office towers into apartments was viewed as a key strategy. However, these projects proved expensive and logistically complex. Like some other cities, San Francisco has seen zero conversions, despite the hyped up potential.\nThe tax increment financing district set up by Lurie and the San Francisco Board of Supervisors could put more than $1.2 billion of redirected property tax increases into these projects over the next 30 years, according to city documents. The city estimates that about 50 buildings within the district could make for a good conversion, with the potential to add up to 7,000 new homes. One source inside the city\u2019s Office of Economic and Workforce Development\ntold the San Francisco Chronicle\nthat the typical project could receive about $100,000 per unit in incentives.\nYet, conversions are most feasible when the commercial real estate market has hit the floor, and investors can purchase old towers for steep discounts. Over the last year, the city\u2019s\ncommercial real estate market has bounced back profoundly\n. However, much of that activity has been confined to Class A and trophy buildings, which has left mid-to-low tier office towers,\nsuch as the one at 260 California Street,\nwith big question marks looming overhead.\nNew life for capped taxes\nSince it went into effect nearly three years ago,\nMeasure United to House L.A.\nhas drawn the attention of housing developers up and down California. Approved by voters in Los Angeles, ULA, which implements a 4-to-5.5 percent real estate transfer tax on home sales of greater than $5 million, has been criticized for stalling new housing construction in the city. Late last month, the\nLos Angeles City Council rejected proposed amendments to the legislation\n\u2014 which would have to be approved by voters \u2014 that would have carved out exemptions to the tax for multifamily properties.\nThwarted development in Los Angeles has seemed to fuel interest in a statewide limit on local real estate transfer taxes. A petition is now circling the state that asks whether they want to vote capping real estate transfer taxes throughout California. If it qualifies, which the president of the sponsoring Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association told CalMatters he is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about, Californians would vote on the tax cap in November. The League of California Cities estimates the measure, if approved, could trim tax revenue up to $3 billion per year, with the shortfall spread over municipalities big and small.\nYet, it may not be the only citizen-initiated tax limit on the ballot in November. Earlier this week, a petition began making its way through California that would exempt homeowners 60 and older from paying property taxes on their primary residence. According to the Secretary of State\u2019s office, the initiative could cost local governments and school districts up to $20 billion per year.\nCalifornia homeowners already enjoy the benefits of Prop 13. Passed in 1978 after a tax revolt, Prop 13 changed the landscape of homeownership in California, as it tightly limited how much a home\u2019s assessed value could increase. It is essentially rent control for owners. The legislation has resulted in fewer houses hitting the market, and has been cited as exacerbating the state\u2019s housing crisis.\n",

        "content": "Hilton &amp; Hyland\nlost its managing director, and you could call industry reaction to the latest in the brokerage\u2019s saga muted to say the least.\nSteve Katz, who joined the brokerage a\u00a0 little over a year ago, exited quietly shortly after New Year\u2019s Day, and was succeeded by Felix Pena.\nA lack of buzz about the latest twist at Hilton &amp; Hyland calls into question the brokerage\u2019s relevance in the market, and it comes off of what could be viewed as a particularly tough stretch for the business. That includes agent and executive departures, a lawsuit from what is now Hilton &amp; Hyland\u2019s former landlord over alleged unpaid rent, and a move to smaller offices on Maple Drive in Beverly Hills\u2019s Golden Triangle.\nInterestingly, the Maple Drive address is the same building where Hilton Hilton \u2014 the brokerage led by Hilton &amp; Hyland co-founder Rick Hilton \u2014 has set up shop. That business also seems to be at its own inflection point.\nThe Real Deal\nreported earlier this month The Agency poached\nJustin Alexander\nand two of his team members from Hilton Hilton. That\u2019s left the brokerage with an agent headcount of four, according to records pulled from the California Department of Real Estate on Friday.\nOn the primaries\nWant another example of a muted reaction from this past week? Look no further than L.A.\u2019s mayoral race, which saw Fourth District Councilmember\nNithya Raman\n\u2019s last-minute entry about a week ago.\nIf residential real estate cared about this latest development for the June primaries, the industry hid it well.\nRaman, a Democratic Socialists of America member, turned the heads of some within real estate late last month with her proposed\nMeasure United to House L.A.\ncarveouts, which mainly speak to commercial developers. That\u2019s a 15-year exemption from the tax for newly built multifamily, commercial and mixed-use projects. For existing commercial and residential properties, the proposed amendments do little outside a carveout in instances of a natural disaster. This could explain the largely silent reaction to the latest development at city hall.\nStill, when it comes to mayor of Los Angeles, the question is whether the industry\u2019s residential segment will offer a collective \u2014 or at least stronger \u2014 voice on the matter.\nWhat people are saying\nIn residential real estate, market dynamics are often oversimplified to either a buyer\u2019s or seller\u2019s market. What\u2019s playing out right now is more nuanced.\nCarolwood Estates\u2019 Jonathan Mogharrabi and Marci Kays are coming off a busy week in which they closed on\ntwo Los Feliz properties\n. That\u2019s no easy feat in an Eastside market Mogharrabi described as being more \u201csensitive\u201d in terms of deal flow. It\u2019s not that the market is slow, he said. It could be that the sell strategy of other listings may be missing the mark or buyer expectations.\nWhat he\u2019s saying holds weight considering he and Kays just double ended Wednesday\u2019s closing of Fear of God founder and designer Jerry Lorenzo\u2019s Los Feliz home at 2401 Nottingham Avenue for $8.6 million. Then, on Friday, the two represented the buyer and seller on 2720 Glendower Avenue for $7.4 million.\nWhat Mogharrabi is saying lines up with a point Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Nicole Plaxen noted last month when the listing at\n1200 Bel Air Road\nwas reduced to just under $100 million. That price cut wasn\u2019t the result of no buyer interest, she pointed out. Instead, it was about meeting \u201ctoday\u2019s buyer mindset.\u201d\nLA\u2019s condo market\nNext week sales are expected to resume on the former Pendry Residences, now called the\nSun Rose Residences\n.\nThere are a dozen units left at the 40-residence property sitting at 8420 Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood. They\u2019ll be priced from $4.3 million to $8 million and range from 3,010 square feet to 4,656 square feet of interior space.\nCondo building relaunches and resets are not an anomaly in a market often viewed as less mature than New York or Miami. Salespeople like to talk about the demand for security and services at a condo tower that are supposedly boosting local demand, but one can\u2019t turn away from all the about-faces on strategies to sell.\nLast June,\nTRD\nreported on the\nreintroduction\nof the Mandarin Oriental Residences in Beverly Hills and The Harland in West Hollywood. Each property has its own reason for the why behind the retooling. Part of it was a pricing mismatch. Sometimes it comes down to understanding the market and what amenities make sense.\nAll that to say, it will be interesting to see what\u2019s in store for when the Aman Residences \u2014 the ultra-luxe condos at Cain\u2019s\nOne Beverly Hills\nmixed-use project \u2014 are delivered to the market.\n",

Yet, a trial date remains elusive.\nIn 2022, five people were\narrested\nover allegations that former board members hired bogus contractors and diverted payments, including to ex-board President Marglli Gallego and her husband, Jose Gonzalez, who allegedly led some of the fake vendors, court filings say. Three more people \u2013\u2013 two of them Gallego relatives \u2013\u2013 were later\ncharged\n. Two of the ex-board members originally arrested have since switched to guilty pleas and cooperated with investigators.\nThe remaining six defendants maintain their not guilty pleas. Gallego, painted as the ringleader by prosecutors, is the only one still in jail after being\ndenied bond\n.\nSince the initial charges, the West Kendall HOA went through\nreceivership\n, multiple civil suits and board elections. The criminal case? It periodically pops up for brief status hearings that shed no light on when trial will begin. Sometimes, hearings are postponed, including one for Feb. 6 moved to Tuesday.\n\u201cWe all want a conclusion,\u201d said Ana Danton, one of the roughly 18,000 Hammocks residents.\nAt issue:\nHOA\nfraud cases are massive, involving voluminous evidentiary files, and many witnesses and subpoenas, experts say. The problem is especially pronounced at the Hammocks due to its size and the fact that the HOA kept paper records. The court called it a \u201cmonster\u201d case.\nBy last spring, the state submitted its final evidence, so Judge Laura Cruz called on defense attorneys to schedule depositions and said that continually blaming the amount of paperwork would eventually become\n\u201cproblematic.\n\u201d Gallego\u2019s attorney,\nSabino Jauregui\n, countered the state had years to review files but the defense gets\nmonths.\nHe then filed a motion to disqualify or recuse Cruz, which was denied. (Judge Andrea Ricker Wolfson now presides, which a court spokesperson previously said was due to regular judge rotation.)\nJauregui and most defense attorneys didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Gonzalez\u2019s attorney declined to comment.\nGeorge Pallas, an attorney for\nIvan Dario Diez\n, accused of posing as a vendor, said the state controls the investigation\u2019s pace and built its case \u201cincrementally,\u201d hence Diez\u2019s 2024 arrest, showing \u201cthe probe is still active and evolving.\u201d\n\u201cMy client is entitled to a complete picture of the evidence, not piecemeal revelations that keep extending the proceedings,\u201d said Pallas, who has said Diez did legitimate work and was targeted by others who took plea deals.\nFor Hammocks residents, the protracted case has been years in the making. It took five years after investigators started poking into the HOA for the 2022 charges to be filed.\n\u201cWe want it to end, and it\u2019s been so long,\u201d Danton said.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill California\u2019s wealth tax send even more billionaires fleeing to South Florida?

        "content": "Ron Perelman is one step closer to shedding his worldly possessions.\nThe billionaire sold his Upper East Side townhouse at 36 East 63rd Street for $46.75 million, a source close to the deal told\nThe Real Deal\n. The townhouse had been asking $49.5 million.\nThe Modlin Group\u2019s Adam Modlin and Brown Harris Stevens\u2019 Sami Hassoumi had the listing. Leslie Garfield\u2019s Matt Lesser represented the buyer.\nPerelman listed the home for $60 million in 2021 during a period in which he sold off many of his assets in an attempt to live a \u201csimpler life.\u201d In 2022, he sold his Hamptons estate for\n$84 million\n.\nHis 40-foot-wide Neo Georgian Mansion proved harder to unload, and the listing rotated through a number of the top townhouse brokers in the city.\nPerelman initially tried to sell both the larger home and an attached smaller townhouse for\n$75 million in 2020\n, before listing his 16,000-square-foot house separately in\nApril 2021\n. Both listings were with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Serena Boardman.\nBHS\u2019 Paula Del Nunzio joined as a co-broker several months later. In 2023, John Burger and Sami Hassoumi of BHS\ntook over the listing\nat the same $60 million price tag.\nThe next year, Modlin replaced Burger. He and Hassoumi kept the home priced at $60 million until finally lowering the price to $55 million in October 2024, and then to its last asking price of $49.5 million in June 2025.\nThe property had served as Perelman\u2019s primary residence for years. Built in 1930, it once served as a private club for aviators, known as the Hangar Club. The home has 10 bedrooms and more than 10 bathrooms across its three floors. It has a private screening room, a home gym, a wine cellar and a landscaped roof.\nAt one point in the 1980s, Perelman was considered the richest man in America. His firm, MacAndrews &amp; Forbes, owned a number of high-profile brands, including Marvel Comics and later, Revlon. The firm suffered during the pandemic as Revlon\u2019s share price plummeted from $25 to $5. It was during this time that Perelman sold a number of his personal assets, including planes, yachts and part of his art collection.\nThe townhouse is the latest in what has been a string of marquee Upper East Side homes to sell after years on the market.\nLast year, the\nWoolworth Mansion\nat 4 East 80th Street sold for $38 million after asking as high as $90 million back in 2011. Less than one block away from Perelman\u2019s home, Oleg Cassini\u2019s former townhouse, which one asked $65 million, is awaiting court approval for a sale after receiving\nan offer of $35 million\nlast fall.",

The sellers were\nPhillipe and Josette Pommez\n, and the buyers were\nRobert and Sandra Bonfield.\nThe oceanfront unit spans about 4,200 square feet and has three bedrooms, four and a half bathrooms, a balcony and three parking spaces.

It went on the market in November, for just under $9.5 million.\nLiza Pulitzer\nwith Brown Harris Stevens represented both sides of the transaction.\nBy the Numbers:\nMortgage delinquencies tick up as affordability strains homeowners\nThe U.S. affordability crisis is continuing to take a toll on homeowners, an increasing share of whom are missing their mortgage payments.\nIn the fourth quarter, the share of delinquent mortgages ticked up 28 basis points year over year and 27 basis points quarter over quarter to reach 4.26 percent, according to the\nMortgage Bankers Association\n. While more homeowners are falling behind on payments, the rate of loans starting the\nforeclosure\nprocess held relatively steady compared to the quarter and year before, at about 0.2 percent.\nMississippi had the highest 90-day delinquency rate, of 2.66 percent, and the highest 30-day delinquency rate, of 3.98 percent.

        "content": "High-profile Chicago real estate industry figures are pouring donations into the Cook County Board President\u2019s race, but are showing less of a united front than they are in the\nTax Assessor\u2019s race,\ncampaign finance data shows.\nChicago Alderman Brendan Reilly, who represents much of the Loop and River North, is challenging longtime incumbent Toni Preckwinkle in the Democratic primary for Cook County Board President, which is set for March 17.\nAs final donations roll in, industry leaders including Fifield Companies\u2019 Steve Fifield, Riverside Investment\u2019s John O\u2019Donnell, Hubbard Street Group\u2019s John McLinden, developer Scott Greenberg, Waterton CEO David Schwartz, Equity Commonwealth REIT CEO David Helfand and members of\nbillionaire Neil Bluhm\u2019s family\nare some of Reilly\u2019s most prominent real estate donors. Neil Bluhm, his son Andrew and daughter Meredith Bluhm each gave $17,000 to the Reilly campaign.\nOne of Reilly\u2019s most impactful real estate donors is former Cinespace owner-turned-real estate investor and lender\nAlexander Pissios\nwho gave the campaign $50,000. Other business community donors include trading and real estate investment firm DRW\u2019s founder\nDon Wilson\nand Lettuce Entertain You restaurant group founder Rich Melman.\nWhile Preckwinkle has courted fewer industry heavy-hitters than Reilly, she still secured some donations from prominent real estate names, including\nCapri Investment\u2019s Quintin Primo\nand Clayco\u2019s Michael Fassnacht. She has also enjoyed broad support from construction companies and trade unions like The Chicago Federation of Labor and the International Association of Operating Engineers.\nReilly has raised at least $609,000 since the start of 2026, when his campaign had over $1.2 million on hand, compared to Preckwinkle raising at least $480,000 raised since the start of the year, when she had more than $614,000 in campaign cash, according to state campaign finance reports.\nThe labor and business split is a departure from patterns seen in donations in the Cook County Tax Assessor\u2019s race. Both groups are coalescing around challenger Patrick Hynes instead of incumbent Fritz Kaegi, a recent analysis by\nThe Real Deal\nfound.\nBoth Kaegi and Preckwinkle are supported by progressive organization Citizens Action Illinois. But Preckwinkle hasn\u2019t faced as much public scrutiny as Kaegi, who has borne the brunt of the blame from real estate investors frustrated by\nwild fluctuations in Cook County tax bills\nsince the pandemic. Preckwinkle also secured a $150,000 donation from Governor J.B. Pritzker.\nFurther, she\ncommissioned a study of Chicago\u2019s property tax system\nmore broadly with a goal of making the process more predictable for investors and homeowners alike. Kaegi has said he supports the recommendations in the study, which includes improving communication and data sharing between the tax assessor and the Board of Review so that initial assessments and appealed assessments\ndon\u2019t vary as widely as they do now\n.\nMeanwhile, Reilly, a moderate Democrat on Chicago City Council, is running a critical campaign against Preckwinkle amid backlash against progressives more generally. As Chicago\u2019s progressive\nMayor Brandon Johnson struggles\nto maintain support, real estate figures have been strategizing ways to regain influence in local politics.\nReilly has tried to pin blame on Preckwinkle for recently blown deadlines during a technology update for Cook County\u2019s property tax data and billing systems that severely delayed tax bills. The systemic setbacks causing the late tax bills forced local school districts to incur steep interest costs on loans while they waited for their share of tax revenue.\nReilly even suggested he would cancel the county\u2019s long-running contract with Tyler Technologies \u2014 the firm tasked with the tech upgrade \u2014 if the delays persist.\nPreckwinkle has pushed back against this narrative, noting that the property tax system is a multi-agency effort involving other independently elected officials, like the assessor and treasurer, who handle valuations and billing. She maintains that the solution lies in collaborative problem-solving rather than finding fault or attacking colleagues in other departments.\nHer supporters point out she hasn\u2019t raised Cook County\u2019s portion of the property tax levy for her entire tenure, nearly 16 years.\nWhoever wins the March primary is expected to win the general election in November because Cook County is considered a safely Democratic county.",
