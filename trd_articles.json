        "content": "Rankings\nand superlatives are probably the one thing agents and brokerages can agree they love to hate and then love again.\nMost are unable to look away from perusing said rankings even if they take issue with the methodology.\nWith the Los Angeles County ranking for this year\u2019s top agents and teams now complete, the list may be as close to a reflection of the high end of the market one can get. That statement doesn\u2019t gloss over the common complaints heard each year from some in the industry, most notably that the list throws teams and solo agents into the same ring.\nTo be fair, it\u2019s not an apples to apples comparison when, for example, a 15-person team\u2019s production is going up against the business of an agent that operates solo. However, the market\u2019s housing inventory isn\u2019t siphoned off into buckets of what can be bought and sold by a team or a single agent.\nAll that said, the Williams &amp; Williams Estate Group, helmed by Branden and Rayni Williams, took the No. 1 spot on this year\u2019s list with about $1.3 billion in production and 197 deals.\nKurt Rappaport\n, co-founder of Westside Estate Agency, ranked No. 5 overall but if we were only counting single agents, he\u2019d rank at the top with $568 million dollars closed across the 19 deals he handled, and lead on median price, too.\nLack of context\nSpeaking of superlatives, a Redfin report found the sale of Rick Caruso\u2019s former home at 912 Benedict Canyon Drive to be the U.S.\u2019s priciest deal in\nAugust\n.\nThe property sold for\n$47.5 million\n, although the designation of \u201cpriciest\u201d lacked market context beyond the month of August, the traditional dog days for residential sales.\nFor example, within Los Angeles County, the most expensive home sales to date in 2025 were two properties that each sold for $110 million: 630 Nimes Road in Bel-Air and 594 South Mapleton Drive in Holmby Hills.\nAgainst the backdrop of the broader U.S. residential market, Nimes Road and Mapleton Drive are tied for second place after the\n$225 million sale\nof a three-address, 15-acre compound in Naples, Florida.\nThe April sale consisted of 2170, 2200 and 2340 Gordon Drive and is now the second-most expensive residential sale in U.S. history.\nAll that to say, awarding superlatives based on the timespan of a week or month doesn\u2019t always offer the clearest view of much of anything.\n\nNavigating Measure ULA\nThe rankings and records indicate that agents in Los Angeles are still closing deals even with what some liken to a big wet rag on business in the form of\nMeasure ULA\n.\nThe two-tiered tax on all property \u2014 commercial and residential \u2014 went into effect in April 2023 and currently assesses a 4 percent fee on deals starting at $5.3 million or 5.5 percent on $10.6 million or more.\nRayni Williams, CEO and co-founder of the Beverly Hills Estates, called ULA the \u201cbiggest detriment\u201d for the market currently.\nThat\u2019s \u201cmore than interest rates. More than world events,\u201d she added.\nOthers see things differently and have largely accepted the tax as a cost of doing business.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to accept it\u2019s there, otherwise what can we do?\u201d said David Berg of Smith &amp; Berg Partners at Compass. \u201cWe can yell and scream about it and hope that there\u2019s a solution that comes along. Maybe it\u2019s repealed, but essentially, it\u2019s a fact of life at this point for what we do.\u201d\nRecommended reading\nTRD\ntagged along with Amalfi Estates founder Anthony Marguleas in the\nPacific Palisades\nlast month.\nThe ride along offered not only a sense of what it\u2019s like to do business in the community, but also on the progress that\u2019s been made in the Pacific Palisades since January\u2019s fire.\nA subsequent visit back noted a steady stream of dine-in and to-go business from construction workers and locals at the Palisades Garden Caf\u00e9. Construction equipment sat parked at Rick Caruso\u2019s Palisades Village on the other side of Sunset Boulevard, where a group of suits walked around the retail center, which remains under repair in the wake of the blaze.\nThe split-screen along Sunset illustrated that there\u2019s still plenty of work ahead,\u00a0but construction on residential lots is becoming increasingly common as the community moves forward.\n",

        "content": "Developers and brokers are bullish on South Florida. Talk of a recession is unwarranted, they say. What about a housing bubble? Also unlikely.\nMiami\u2019s perpetual optimism helps mask some of the issues that we\u2019ve been reporting on.\nIn\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s\ncover story\n, I took a macro look at the real estate market in South Florida and the red flags that may be clouding the region\u2019s future.\nA lot is going well, and an abundance of industry pundits are available to speak to that. The wealth migration continues, and construction crews are showing up to work every day. But many challenges also have plagued developers for years. Condo sales slowed, construction, insurance and debt are all too expensive. Projects require more equity. And some sectors are experiencing longer, stronger pauses than others.\nCondo developers have had to secure more equity at a time when equity is lacking, one capital markets broker told me. We reported this summer that many multifamily developers sitting on land are looking to sell their sites, and demand for spec office space has dried up. Retail is still doing well.\nAnd restaurants had to endure a tough summer. Many closed.\nOne thing that I\u2019ve noticed in conversations with sources and publicists is that developers and real estate agents are cutting back on their marketing budgets. They\u2019re re-engineering projects to save money, even if they have already sold those units. Companies have stopped hiring, or pulled back on hiring.\nAffordability is playing a big role in the region\u2019s economy because the gap between the haves and the have-nots has grown tremendously.\nLate last month, UBS released its housing bubble report, which looks at price to income, price to rent and prices compared to the national average. At the top? Miami. If only the wealthy can afford to live here, that will have a big effect on the region in the long term.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nHistorian Marvin Dunn alleges in a new lawsuit that Miami Dade College violated Sunshine Laws in\napproving land\nfor a potential Trump Presidential Library without public input. The site could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. What do you think, and how does this end? Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\n\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential\n: Deborah Ann Robinson, a novelist and the widow of Edward J. Robinson, chief financial officer of RJR Nabisco, parted with a single-family home at 217 Clarke Avenue in Palm Beach for $30 million. The buyer was Southern Mark LLC, a Delaware-registered company reportedly tied to Winifred \u201cWinnie\u201d Johnson Marquart, heir to the SC Johnson fortune.\nCommercial\n:\nTishman Speyer acquired\na 270-unit apartment complex at 5500 Broken Sound Boulevard Northwest and 950 Northwest Broken Sound Parkway in Boca Raton for $124.5 million. The seller of the complex, known as the Bell at Broken Sound Apartments, was Greensboro, North Carolina-based Bell Partners.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nAn oceanfront estate in Manalapan hit the market for $75 million. The ocean-to-lake compound at\n640 South Ocean Boulevard\nwas built in 2020. The nearly 17,000-square-foot mansion has 11 bedrooms, six and a half bathrooms, a gym, spa, bar and lounge, two boat lifts, a guard house and a guest house, according to the listing. Casey Flannery of Equestrian Sotheby\u2019s International Realty has the listing. The property is owned by a trust, and it was on the market last year for $85 million. It sold in 2020 for $36 million.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nFlorida\u2019s Treasure Coast is living up to its name. A shipwreck salvage company recovered more than\n1,000 silver and gold coins\nvalued at about $1 million from an 18th-century shipwreck. The treasure is allegedly part of gold, silver and jewels lost by the Spanish fleet during a hurricane more than 200 years ago.\nElsewhere in Florida\nAs lawyers duke it out in court over the future of Alligator Alcatraz, the Trump administration awarded Florida $608 million for the state\u2019s immigrant detention efforts, the\nNews Service of Florida reports\n. The money will come from the $150 billion that Congress awarded to the Federal Emergency Management Agency this year.\nFlorida regulators will open hearings Monday on Florida Power &amp; Light\u2019s revised $7 billion rate hike, down from its original $9.8 billion proposal, according to\nFlorida Phoenix\n. Critics called FPL\u2019s original proposal the largest utility rate increase in U.S. history, and the latest proposal would still grant FPL a return on equity above the national average.\nA grand jury in Tallahassee will hear testimony this month as part of a criminal probe into the Hope Florida Foundation, a charity led by First Lady Casey DeSantis, after revelations that $10 million from a state settlement was funneled into a political committee tied to Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 chief of staff, the\nMiami Herald\nreports.",

        "content": "Nail-polish money provided the gloss for the biggest condominium sale in Los Angeles County in the first half of the year, with former OPI nail polish executive Miriam Schaeffer paying $39.1 million purchase of a full-floor penthouse in Century City, according to Los Angeles County tax assessor records. The January deal at The Century also marks the county\u2019s\nmost expensive condo trade\nin at least the past three years, as\nThe Real Deal\nreported.\nThis is the latest installment in a feature providing a weekly update on top sales by market segment, based on TRDData for given periods. You can see the top 10 condo sales for the first half of the year by clicking\nhere\n.\nThe seller \u2014 represented by Douglas Elliman\u2019s Bachir Oueida \u2014 was Vicki Walters, who listed the property at 1 West Century Drive for $50 million in 2023, according to the\nWall Street Journal\n. Her late husband, Raul Walters, was a real estate developer who built and financed early Walmart stores. Walters paid $22.5 million for the residence in 2015, property records show.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Jacob Dadon negotiated on behalf of Schaeffer, whose ex-husband founded OPI.\n\nThe 9,400-square-foot unit, which went for $4,153 per square foot, includes three bedrooms and seven bathrooms. Touches include hand-painted 22-karat gold leaf on the ceiling and 11-foot projector screens. The apartment also comes with a 500-square-foot studio, a pool cabana, a separate 1,200-square-foot office suite and four parking spaces.\nOther high-profile deals in the Robert AM Stern-designed building include Candy Spelling \u2014 widow of Aaron Spelling \u2014 buying a penthouse unit for $35 million in 2010, and singer Rihanna\nselling\nher condo in 2024 for $20.8 million\na year after acquiring it\nfor $21 million. Rihanna\u2019s unit was once owned by the late \u201cFriends\u201d star Matthew Perry.\nSchaeffer, whose fortune tracks to the OPI nail-polish brand founded by her now ex-husband, is an active player in the L.A. County high-end residential real estate market.\nIn September 2024 she sold the Malibu carbon neutral residence named\nZero One\nat 11865 Ellice Street for $25 million. She acquired the 4,300-square-foot\n31048 Broad Beach Road\nin Malibu in 2023 for $35 million. And she spent roughly $51 million in 2021 across three purchases for properties in Los Angeles, Malibu and Hidden Hills.\n",

        "content": "A group of Dream Town agents in Chicago has moved over to Compass, notching a win for the national firm as it chases growth in Chicago\u2019s market.\nJoey Halperin, David Schatz and Chris Sweitzer joined Compass on Sept. 29 as the principals of their new team, Terra Group. They brought along Megan O\u2019Carroll, Dana Noureldin, Riley Callahan and Daniel Banys, all previously members of the Halperin Schatz team at Dream Town, which is owned by independent brokerage Baird &amp; Warner.\nAll seven agents have worked at Compass in the past, and Halperin said the return to Compass was a \u201cfull circle\u201d moment for the team.\nThe move is further evidence of competition for agents and market share between Compass and the remaining Chicago brokerages that aren\u2019t affiliated with the real estate behemoth. Compass announced its plan to\nmerge with Anywhere Real Estate last month\n, which would bring some of the city\u2019s biggest brokerages under its banner. It purchased Chicago\u2019s largest brokerage, @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, last year.\nThe purchase of @properties left Baird &amp; Warner, which\nacquired Dream Town earlier this year\n, as the largest independent brokerage in Chicago. Baird &amp; Warner president and CEO Steve Baird said in an earlier interview with\nThe Real Deal\nthat he sees the consolidation as an opportunity to grow Baird &amp; Warner and pick up more agents as mergers disrupt the brokerage space.\nPeter Cummins, a longtime @properties agent on the North Shore recently moved to Baird &amp; Warner,\nciting opposition to consolidation\nand private exclusive listings as his reason for the move.\nBut the move back to Compass by these agents gives weight to Compass\u2019 bet that its deep agent network, technology platforms and exclusive listing strategy will attract more agents.\n\nThe members of the new Compass team made a combined $55 million in sales in the last 12 months, Sweitzer said. The team has a focus on selling new development, with about 60 to 70 percent of the agents\u2019 business being in new construction, Schatz said. Sweitzer also focuses on investment properties.\nHalperin said access to Compass\u2019 private exclusives is a plus, especially in new developments. Compass has been pushing a three-phase marketing strategy, where some properties begin as private exclusives marketed only to Compass agents. The company says the strategy offers sellers more freedom and privacy and helps them test pricing before their house hits the open market.\nZillow and many of Compass\u2019 competitors, like Baird &amp; Warner, have\nopposed the trend toward private exclusive\nlistings, arguing they distort the market for consumers and are anti-competitive.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the basketball player where you hate to play against him but you love when you\u2019re on the team,\u201d Halperin said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that, when we weren\u2019t on the team, we didn\u2019t necessarily love, but now that we\u2019re on the team, it\u2019s giving our clients an advantage.\u201d\nBeyond the initial group of seven, the team\u2019s principals said they hope to attract more agents going forward.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to be able to scale a team quite well and bring a really strong group of like-minded individuals together and make a really, really solid team,\u201d Sweitzer said.\n",

        "content": "The CRE loans hitting the auction block in Texas this month dipped slightly despite warnings of an\nimminent wave of multifamily distress\n.\nThis month will see $575 million in loans at the auction block across the Texas Triangle, down from\n$710 million in September\nand\n$670 million in August\n, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service.\nHarris County, home to Houston, was once again the hardest hit, with 11 properties totaling nearly $270 million in debt facing foreclosure.\nHere are the biggest loans up for auction this month. It\u2019s possible that some of these borrowers and lenders will reach agreements to avoid auction.\nHouston\nThe largest CRE loan debuting on the auction block in Houston this month is a $42 million mortgage tied to the 265-unit Adenine Apartments. Unlike most of the multifamily properties facing foreclosure in Harris County, this one is relatively new, built in 2016. Madera Residential, which is based in Lubbock, bought the apartment complex, at 1755 Wyndale Street, in 2023. The debt is a collateralized loan structured by Prime Finance Partners. It works out to $158,490 per unit.\nSan Antonio\nTroubled investor Alan Stalcup and his firm GVA\nare facing foreclosure on Barcelo Apartments, a 288-unit apartment complex at 3501 Pin Oak Drive in San Antonio. CBRE Multifamily provided the $30.5 million mortgage. The debt on the property, built in 1972, works out to $106,000 per unit.\nDallas\nArbor Realty is foreclosing on Parea Oak Lawn, at 4503 Lake Avenue. Lakewood, New Jersey-based\nSun Equity Partners\nis the owner. The $25.5 million mortgage on the 131-unit property built in 1970 works out to $194,656 per unit.\nFort Worth\n\nThe loan tied to Arioso Apartments &amp; Townhomes is supposed to hit the auction block this month. A Rialto Real Estate fund provided the $56 million mortgage for the 288-unit property at 3030 Claremont Drive in Grand Prairie. Ed Monce\u2019s IMH Companies bought the property in 2022.

        "content": "New York City authorities are claiming a win in their push to enforce standards on landlords after\nMeyer Chetrit\u2019s indictment\non felony charges of tenant harassment.\nThe action is an escalation of city enforcement actions against landlords, who are largely subject to administrative penalties and rarely face criminal charges.\n\u201cFor folks who are following the law, this evens the playing field,\u201d said Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. \u201cOur hope is that the industry would be supportive of this kind of alleged conduct being rooted out.\u201d\nChetrit has been charged with two counts of harassment of a rent-regulated tenant, a felony that carries a maximum sentence of four years in prison.\nChetrit, through defense attorney Jeffrey Chartier, denied the allegations.\nBragg cited Chetrit\u2019s track record of poor conditions at his properties that persist after penalties and inquiries from the Department of Buildings and Loft Board. That gives the case evidence, but it also means that criminal sanctions are the appropriate next step, he said.\nBringing a criminal case to trial can be a deterrent to the cost-benefit analyses landlords make about administrative penalties, according to Jocelyn Strauber, Department of Investigations commissioner.\n\u201cWe suspect there\u2019s more conduct like this out there, which we will be looking for,\u201d Strauber said.\nMaking the case\nAshley Viruet, deputy director at Legal Services of New York City, said tenant harassment is still quite common in New York, and something tenants\u2019 attorneys see often. A one-off prosecution, she said, may not be enough to curb bad behavior.\n\u201cI appreciate that they\u2019re trying to put landlords on notice,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not entirely sure that it\u2019s going to change behaviors.\u201d\nAlthough Chetrit is facing potential prison time, that result would be something of a first for New York. There has not been a high-profile case where a landlord has served in prison specifically for tenant harassment.\nOther landlords who have tangled with law enforcement have either avoided time in state prison so far or have been sent there for other crimes.\nDaniel Ohebshalom was jailed at Rikers Island\nlast year for his refusal to fix deteriorating conditions at two Washington Heights buildings even after court orders. Last May, Ohebshalom was indicted on charges of tenant harassment and accused of filing false documents with the city.\nIn 2022, landlord Raphael Toledano was banned from real estate activity\nin New York for five years after he violated an agreement with the state to stop harassing tenants.\n\nSteve Croman, once named among the worst landlords in the city, faced a civil suit from the state for tenant harassment, which he\nsettled for $8 million in restitution in 2017\n. (He was\nsentenced to state prison in 2017\n, but for mortgage and tax fraud.)\n\u201cHistorically, the D.A.\u2019s office has wanted some kind of financial crime as kind of the linchpin to hold it all together,\u201d said Viruet, who is part of the team representing tenants of Ohebshalom in housing court.\nThere are other divisions in New York that come after landlords for tenant harassment, said Sherwin Belkin, a landlord-side real estate attorney and founding partner at Belkin Burden Goldman. But rarely do accusations to rise to the criminal level.\n\u201cProsecution for criminal harassment is a serious matter,\u201d Belkin said. \u201cI assume it\u2019s being taken very seriously by Mr. Chetrit and his attorneys.\u201d\nThe\ndistrict attorney alleged Chetrit\nallowed conditions in 111-117 West 26th Street to deteriorate, leaving the two senior citizens without heat or, in some cases, an elevator.\nThe tenants have special protection because they are in rent-stabilized apartments overseen by the city\u2019s loft board.\nChartier, Chetrit\u2019s defense attorney, cast doubt on the facts of the case, alleging that one of the two senior citizens is not a true resident of the building.\n\u201cRather than prosecute violent criminals that are plaguing the city, Bragg has again chosen to misapply the law in pursuit of a progressive political agenda,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s not the first time tenants have raised concerns about conditions in buildings associated with Chetrit.\nElected officials on the Upper West Side have raised alarms about\nChetrit\u2019s management of the Park West Village\non Columbus Avenue between West 97th and 100th streets. Tenants there have accused Chetrit of pocketing city rent subsidies without crediting them to renters\u2019 accounts, and then pursuing eviction.\nState Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal launched a confidential survey to determine the scope of the problem.\n\u201cMeyer Chetrit\u2019s indictment echoes the pattern of harassment and mismanagement that tenants in my district have reported for years under his management,\u201d Hoylman-Sigal said in a statement to\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cNo landlord should take taxpayer funds, bill tenants twice, and leave people in unsafe homes.\u201d\nRent-stabilized tenants at\n496 Metropolitan Avenue in Brooklyn\naccused an entity associated with Chetrit of abandoning the building. About one-third of the tenants filed a petition against the building owner in March, alleging dangerous conditions, harassment and retaliatory eviction. The building\u2019s lender has also brought a commercial foreclosure case on the building.\nThe city of Cleveland sued the Chetrits\u2019 family firm in 2023\nover conditions at three buildings\nin the city after tenants complained of broken elevators, malfunctioning heat, and negligent security. The city was seeking a receiver for the properties, but the parties have since proposed a buyer for the buildings, which would end the case.\nChetrit and associated parties are facing multiple civil suits from lenders, including several foreclosure actions. Maverick Real Estate Partners has\naccused Chetrit of fraudulently transferring money\nto shield assets from a $132 million judgment. His lawyers have denied the allegations.\n",

        "content": "The Live Local Act is incentivizing some developers to add affordable housing units with below-market rents to buildings that are already under construction or completed, instead of doing so at the pre-approval stage of development, according to a panel of speakers at the Urban Land Institute\u2019s Fort Lauderdale Forum.\nFor example, the developer of The Arcadian, a 502-unit apartment project in Fort Lauderdale, is in the process of designating some of the apartments as affordable housing units under the state\u2019s\nLive Local Act\n, which encourages the development of rental housing with below-market rents. The developer is Fort Lauderdale-based Fuse Group Investment Companies.\nConstruction of phase one of\nThe Arcadian\nwill be completed by the end of the year, panel member Eyal Peretz, founder of Fuse Group, said during a panel discussion of the Live Local Act at the ULI event last week. The Arcadian \u201cstarted as a non-Live Local project and went through some transformation, and we are going through a process right now where we are about to submit [it as] a Live Local project,\u201d Peretz said.\nAs elevated interest rates and construction costs slow residential development, the Live Local Act\u2019s incentives can make marginal projects more profitable, panelists said. The Live Local Act\u2019s incentives to developers to offer affordable and workforce housing include property tax breaks on apartments with below-market rents.\n\u201cEvery project we\u2019re looking at, we\u2019re looking at adding a Live Local component to it,\u201d said panelist Doron Broman, founder and CEO of Miami-based Moderno Development Group.\u00a0 \u201cMost projects don\u2019t pencil in today. So, with the Live Local Act that gives you additional income, that means, maybe, the project will pencil in.\u201d\n\nModerno started construction of Rivr Lofts, a 29-story, 352-unit apartment building in Fort Lauderdale, in 2022, prior to enactment of the Live Local Act. Construction is complete, and \u201cwe are looking right now at converting some of the units into the Live Local pool,\u201d Broman said. \u201cThe smaller studios seem to be a very good fit for that type of product.\u201d\nThe availability of Live Local units at Rivr Lofts would be limited to people who collect up to 120 percent of area median income. \u201cSo, we\u2019re talking about aiming units at people making around $90,000 a year,\u201d Broman said. \u201cA lot of our residents already fit that criteria, so it\u2019s worthwhile for us to lower the rent a little bit more and get the tax benefit.\u201d\nNot all residential developments are feasible as Live Local projects because blending market-rate apartments and below-market rate apartments in a mixed-income building is difficult, said panelist\nRussell Galbut\n, managing principal of Crescent Heights.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a small percentage, and that\u2019s because you have 60 percent of your building that has to pay for the other 40 percent,\u201d Galbut said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work in paper and pencil, it will never work in brick and mortar.\u201d\nGalbut said the biggest benefit of the state\u2019s Live Local Act is \u201cprompt and professional\u201d municipal approval of developments with affordable housing without a time-consuming review by a planning and zoning board or a city commission. \u201cTime kills many great projects,\u201d he said.\nMany lenders are hesitant to finance construction of mixed-income residential developments under the Live Local Act , Peretz said. \u201cWe see an issue with financing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping it\u2019s going to change \u2026. But I\u2019ve been hearing from a lot of developers with issues on that side of things.\u201d\u201cIt seems we need to get everybody on the same page and make sure \u2026 our cash flow matches with what the lenders are expecting,\u201d said Alfonso Costa Jr., chief operating officer of\nFalcone Group\nand moderator of the panel discussion. \u201cWorking with the takeout agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on takeouts, and then HUD as well, both on the new construction and takeout side, it\u2019s more of an educational process.\u201d",

The 68-year-old is expected to remain in jail until the court\u2019s adjournment concludes in a little more than a month.\nSolny was sentenced to five years of probation in 2019 after pleading guilty to possession of stolen property. He allegedly violated that probation within months after committing another deed theft.\nThis summer, Solny was convicted of stealing 11 homes. He was allowed to be free ahead of his sentencing in the case, which is expected to unfold in Brooklyn this month.\nIt appears Solny wasn\u2019t expecting to be taken to jail when he attended his probation hearing, since he did not have his medicine for high blood pressure in hand, according to one of his lawyers. He added that it was insensitive for him to be taken into custody directly before Yom Kippur.\n\nSolny was known to lure owners in by offering to arrange a short sale, where owners in financial distress sell their home under lender-approved terms for less than they owe on their mortgage. In return, the lender drops the foreclosure action and forgives the balance of the mortgage. After the short sale, however, Solny\u2019s victims \u2014 often Black or Latino families \u2014 would emerge still carrying debt.\nSolny would also tell homeowners that lenders required them to vacate a property for a short sale to occur. They would vacate and he would transfer the deed to himself and start collecting rent on existing tenants or those he brought in.\nWhen the tricked owners would ask what was happening with the sale, he would allegedly tell them negotiations were pending.\nDeed theft is challenging to prosecute, as intent needs to be shown and victims typically sign legally-binding documents, allowing perpetrators to frame schemes as legal business deals.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "You won\u2019t find a more pro-housing politician in the city than Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso. But you wouldn\u2019t know it from his appointee on the City Planning Commission.\nJuan Osorio has repeatedly voted against major housing initiatives.\nLast year, Osorio\nopposed\nCity of Yes for Economic Opportunity \u2014 the only one of the 13 commissioners to do so. But he was just getting warmed up.\nSix months later, he\nvoted against\nthe City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, which at the time was estimated to create 110,000 homes. The City Council later whittled it down to 82,000.\nThis year, Osorio has\nvoted no\non rezonings of Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, Midtown South in Manhattan and downtown Jamaica in Queens, which together should spur 27,000 new homes. The three initiatives passed by a combined vote of 33-5. Only Public Advocate Jumaane Williams\u2019 appointee, self-described Marxist\nLeah Goodridge\n, voted with Osorio.\nIn a moment of weakness, Osorio did vote for the Bronx Metro-North Station Area rezoning, which is projected to add 7,000 units. But otherwise, Reynoso\u2019s representative has been on a rejection rampage.\nOsorio\u2019s remarks at Planning Commission meetings indicate he\u2019s on a quixotic quest for perfection. He wants every conceivable impact studied, not a single manufacturing job displaced and rents affordable to anyone with two nickels to rub together.\nThis kind of thinking is\nWhy Nothing Works\n, as Marc Dunkelman\u2019s new book by that title explains. The author is among many thought leaders urging fellow liberals to prioritize results over process and protectionism.\nOsorio hasn\u2019t gotten the message.\nThe problem with creating fantastically affordable apartments on paper is they don\u2019t materialize in bricks and mortar. The problem with studying everything to death is nothing gets done. The problem with zoning to protect jobs is they inevitably vanish anyway and new ones can\u2019t move in.\nTake the Midtown South rezoning. Osorio\ncast the only \u201cno\u201d vote\n, saying that in a \u201cworst-case scenario,\u201d 5,300 jobs would be displaced from the Garment District.\nAn environmental impact statement had deemed that possible result insignificant. In a borough with 4 million daily workers, a rezoning that displaces 0.1 percent of them in 15 years is hardly a job-killer.\n\u201cBut these are New Yorkers,\u201d Osorio said of the 5,300 hypothetical displacements, \u201cwho rely on these jobs to be able to afford housing in the city.\u201d\nAs a former senior planner at the Municipal Art Society, Osorio must know the Garment District\u2019s manufacturing zoning was preserved for decades by well-meaning politicians, yet nearly all of its textile jobs relocated or disappeared anyway. Buildings aged and emptied out.\nHad the city rezoned long ago, billions more dollars would have been invested in Midtown South real estate, replacing those lost jobs and then some.\nOsorio made the same argument about manufacturing jobs when he\nvoted against the Jamaica rezoning\n, which is expected to create 12,000 homes, including 4,000 affordable.\n\nI get the need for some manufacturing in the city, which is why Mayor Mike Bloomberg carved out Industrial Business Zones. But, pre-Bloomberg, ample industrial zoning did not stop the number of manufacturing jobs from plunging from 1 million to 157,000 in half a century.\nToday,\njust over 50,000\nremain. Osorio\u2019s insistence on saving every one makes no sense in a world where technology constantly improves, destroying some jobs and creating others.\nThe city must ensure zoning allows for this evolution. There will be losers, yes, but far more winners. Omelets can\u2019t be made without breaking eggs.\nReynoso agrees with Osorio on industrial policy. The borough president believes the city could create enough housing in residential areas without touching manufacturing districts.\n\u201cFifty percent of Brooklyn hasn\u2019t built any housing since 1968,\u201d he said in a phone interview, citing Sheepshead Bay, Bay Ridge and Canarsie as among the laggards.\nBut the politics of upzoning there are difficult. The city can\u2019t rely on southern Brooklyn and eastern Queens to create the\n500,000 homes it needs\n.\nReynoso does differ with his appointee, Osorio, on some things. The borough president endorsed City of Yes, urging its housing goals be expanded, not shrunk by rent caps.\n\u201cWe need to be realistic about what City of Yes for Housing Opportunity is and what it is not,\u201d he said last year. \u201cIt is not an affordability strategy.\u201d\nTwo months later, his appointee\nvoted against it\n, citing \u201cthe lack of affordability mandates.\u201d\nLater, Osorio said the low-rent units mandated by Mandatory Inclusionary Housing were not enough for the Atlantic Avenue and Jamaica rezonings.\nWhen I asked Reynoso if Osorio had gone rogue, the borough president said his appointees are independent. \u201cI don\u2019t have any puppets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mayor\u2019s appointees are all rubber stampers. What Osorio is doing is making the Department of City Planning work. He\u2019s challenging them to do better.\u201d\nBut Osorio is making the perfect the enemy of the good. If every planning commissioner were like him, the city would spend even more time studying impacts, protecting jobs and freezing rents \u2014 and getting even less housing built.\nThis is the recipe for failure that Dunkelman and\nother progressives\nare urging the left to abandon. Reynoso appears to be listening.\n\u201cThe progressives are leading the pro-housing movement,\u201d he said. \u201cThe progressives used to be the problem. They were scared of gentrification. But we got new data.\u201d\nYet Reynoso\u2019s appointee keeps asking for more. It\u2019s classic paralysis by analysis \u2014 a demand for Utopia that will never achieve it.\nWe got new data. What they show is we don\u2019t need more data. We need more housing.\n",

        "content": "L&amp;L Holding Company and Columbia Property Trust have landed two large retail tenants at their Terminal Warehouse office and retail redevelopment in West Chelsea.\nEquinox\ninked a 50,000-square-foot long-term lease across the lower three floors of the full-block development at 261 11th Avenue,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned. The asking rent and lease length are unknown.\nMeanwhile, Convene Hospitality Group inked a 50,000-square-foot lease across the same three floors in a different section of the historic building, where it will open an event space called The Mallory. The name is a nod to the original architect of the 1890s building, George Mallory, the company said in a press release.\nOffice tenants will have access to the lounge and conference center, which are slated to open next year. The CHG deal was first reported by the\nNew York Post\n.\nEquinox and CHG are the first new retail tenants since the\n$1.8 billion transformation\nof the late-19th-century 1.3-million-square-foot landmark warehouse into offices, retail space, food and beverage areas as well as other indoor and outdoor amenities. Both will be accessible from the building\u2019s 700-foot tunnel, which was originally used by freight trains shuttling goods between the Hudson River and the railroad system.\nThe building, which is nearing completion, will have 12 floors of office space around a central courtyard.\n\nNewmark\u2019s Jeff Roseman represented Equinox. CBRE\u2019s Rocco Laginestra represented CHG. A Cushman &amp; Wakefield team including Alan Schmerzler, Catherine Merck and Sean Moran represented the landlord in both deals.\nA representative for the landlord declined to comment on the Equinox lease. Equinox did not respond to requests for comment.\nL&amp;L and Normandy Real Estate Partners purchased the building for $880 million in 2018. Columbia entered the picture when it\nacquired Normandy\nin 2019. Two years later, the developers secured a $1.25 billion\nconstruction loan\n, among the largest real estate loans made during the pandemic.\nDespite finding themselves in an unprecedented market due to Covid, the developers plowed ahead with the redevelopment, aiming to bring more than 1 million square feet of office space online in a few years.\nTheir bet could pay off. The tides have begun turning for the Manhattan office market. After\nfinishing last year\non a high note, office leasing volume surpassed 30 million square feet for the year in the third quarter, blowing past pre-Covid levels and marking the strongest period of year-to-date demand since 2002, according to Colliers.\n",

        "content": "A failed flip on the Upper East Side has ensnared a once-busy developer.\nRussian-born developer and art collector Janna Bullock is accused of defaulting on an $8 million loan backed by 14 East 82nd Street, a 9,500-square-foot prewar townhouse she once owned and converted into a single-family home, according to a complaint filed Thursday in Manhattan Supreme Court. The lawsuit also names the property\u2019s owner, Zoya Kuznetsova, as a defendant, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe debt was issued by Antonia Ventures LLC, a shell company linked to Downtown Investment Advisory, a White Plains-based asset manager. The suit claims no payments have been made since February. Bullock personally guaranteed the loan, which means she\u2019s on the hook even though she sold the building more than a decade ago.\nBullock bought the six-story property for $12.2 million in 2006 from Aby Rosen\u2019s RFR Holding, intending to gut-renovate it into a single residence. But construction stalled, leaving the property boarded up with a stop-work order still in place.\nIn 2012, she unloaded the townhouse at a loss for $9.1 million to Kuznetsova, a close associate who, according to society photos and past filings, has family ties to Bullock\u2019s ex-husband, Alexey Kuznetsov, a former Russian government official.\nKuznetsova has since struggled to keep the building out of foreclosure. Last year, the property narrowly avoided auction after she secured emergency financing \u2014 the same loan now in dispute. The lender\u2019s complaint signals that the lifeline may have run out.\n\nBullock, a onetime Guggenheim board member known for flipping Gilded Age townhouses into luxury single-family homes, was among the Upper East Side\u2019s most active redevelopers in the mid-2000s.\nHer projects included 54 East 64th Street, the onetime New York Observer offices, which she bought for $9.5 million in 2004 and resold for $18.7 million two years later, and 9 East 67th Street, which she flipped for roughly $25 million in 2009.\nBullock and Kuznetsov were\nconvicted in absentia\nby a Russian court in 2018 for allegedly embezzling public funds, though both denied the charges.\nKuznetsov was extradited from France to serve his sentence; Bullock remains abroad.\nNeither Bullock nor Kuznetsova could be reached for comment.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Residents of a 180-unit rental building in Sheepshead Bay will soon be saying hello to a new owner: Bonjour Capital.\nThe privately held real estate investment firm acquired the apartment portion of 1501 Voorhies Avenue in the Brooklyn neighborhood for $75 million, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The seller was the prominent multifamily real estate investment trust AvalonBay Communities.\nA Newmark team including Adam Spies, Dan O\u2019Brien and Adam Doneger represented AvalonBay in the deal, which worked out to $417,000 per unit. Both buyer and seller did not respond to the outlet\u2019s request for comment.\nAvalonBay and Muss Development\nfiled plans\nmore than a decade ago for a 30-story building on the site, towering over the rest of the neighborhood and setting the stage for the tallest post-war development in Sheepshead Bay. The partners bought the property in April 2014 for $16.2 million.\nThe development site, an empty lot several blocks from the bay, was completely flooded during Superstorm Sandy.\nIn 2016, the venture filed a \u201ctest the market\u201d application\nfor 56 units\nin the building to be condominiums, rather than rentals. Months later, an official offering plan emerged\nwith a $63 million projected sellout\n. AvalonBay ultimately\nlent $49 million\nfor the project the following year.\n\nCompleted in 2017, the building includes 250,000 square feet of residential space and nearly 34,000 square feet of amenities, including a fitness center, resident lounge, children\u2019s playroom, outdoor pool, barbecues, a bocce court and a pool table.\nThe 12,000-square-foot retail and office portion of the site, listed with an alternative address of 1600 Sheepshead Bay Road, counts Citibank and Starbucks among its tenants.\nOver the summer, Bonjour Capital sold five apartment buildings \u2014 601, 605, 607, 609 and 611 West 137th Street \u2014 to Janusz Sendowski\nfor $62 million\n.\nMeanwhile, Virginia-based AvalonBay recently bought a 270-unit apartment complex in Coconut Creek, Florida\nfor $98.3 million\n.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

They total $142.6 million in asking dollar volume.\nThe teardown at 1821 West 27th Street in Miami Beach topped the report.

        "content": "The\nrichest real estate developer\nin America didn\u2019t spend a lot of words in cutting off one of his sons amid allegations of a high-flying con job in Beverly Hills.\nDonald Bren\n, chairman and owner of\nIrvine Company\n, issued a 12-word rebuke of son David, who has been embroiled in an alleged fraud scandal, the Daily Mail\nreported\n.\n\u201cWe do not have a personal or business relationship with this individual,\u201d the elder Bren said in a statement.\nDavid Bren allegedly bilked investors out of millions for an apparent private members\u2019 club in Beverly Hills called The Bunker, per the Daily Mail. The 33-year-old son of the 92-year-old real estate titan purportedly used his famous last name to lure investors to the $90 million club that never materialized.\nFour separate lawsuits accuse David Bren of fraud, defaulting on leases, forging luxury lifestyle appearances and trespassing into a Beverly Hills home to live without paying rent. Judgments against the embattled real estate heir total approximately $2.6 million and could continue to grow.\nBren has not appeared in court or retained attorneys in the Bunker cases, and as of now has not faced any criminal charges despite referrals to the Los Angeles Police Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nBren promised buyers of memberships access to a $50 million fleet of supercars including Bugattis, Ferraris and Porsches, as well as amenities including luxury restaurants and exclusive wine and private smoking lounges. Angled as a \u201cSoHo House for car lovers,\u201d Bren dropped names of notable figures such as Mark Cuban and Larry Ellison, claiming them as founding members of the $14,500-per-month club.\nWhile The Bunker, backed by the Bren name, attracted interest, investors began filing lawsuits once they picked up a scent of deception.\n\u201cThe Bunker does not exist. There is no ultra-high end automotive club. There are no members. The business is a mirage,\u201d one lawsuit alleges, according to the Daily Mail.\nBren has deployed his links to his father in pursuing prior real estate deals, sources have said.\n\n\u201cHe presented like he could have picked up the phone and called his father right away,\u201d Chris Rising, whose real estate firm was involved in David\u2019s attempts to buy\nMr. C\u2019s\nCameo Beverly Hills hotel, said, per the Daily Mail.\nThe Brens\u2019 relationship \u2014 at least on the surface \u2014 wasn\u2019t as cordial as it seemed.\n\u201cHe was slick. He played this, like, victim; that\u2019s how he pulled people\u2019s heartstrings. \u2018My dad didn\u2019t give me nothing; I could do this, but no one believes in me,\u2019\u201d Mike Tran, a friend of one allegedly defrauded investor,\ntold\nthe Los Angeles Times.\nIn total, more than a dozen investors claim they sunk hundreds of thousands and even millions of money into The Bunker after falling for David Bren\u2019s purported shtick. They were seemingly swayed by him arriving for property tours in a Lamborghini and hosting luxury events he claimed were sponsored by Louis Vuitton.\nInvestor Tony Chen was among those buying what Bren was selling. He put hundreds of thousands of dollars to the venture, but eventually died by suicide in 2022 at the age of 46, according to reports.\nTran believes it was a result of Bren\u2019s actions.\n\u201cTony built out this thing for this guy like, \u2018Oh man, he\u2019s this underdog. He\u2019s this David. And if he gets this right, he\u2019s going to become Goliath,\u2019\u201d Tran told the Times.\nDonald Bren has been married three times and has seven children, according to reports.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The home at 25421 North\nSaint Mary\u2019s Road\nis on a private listing network for $3.25 million, or $626 per square foot.\nMettawa is known for its horse farms and low\nturnover\n, which keeps inventory tight. Listing agent Donna Mercier of\nColdwell Banker\nRealty told the outlet that homes there typically trade below $6.25 million and attract buyers looking for privacy close to Chicago\u2019s\nNorth Shore\n.\nThe \u201cSpaceship House\u201d was built in 1979 by Peter M. Vanderklaauw, who built several UFO-shaped houses.\nWhen seller Bob Hollar first pulled into the driveway of a white, circular home in Mettawa nearly 30 years ago, his first thought was less admiration than disbelief, he told the outlet.\nThat was 1996, when Hollar, a retired healthcare executive, bought the futuristic residence for $525,000 \u2014 largely for the one feature that did impress him: room for his 145-pound Leonberger dog. Over the years, the property grew on him. The pond, fruit trees and sprawling yard turned the oddball structure into a quiet retreat about 35 miles north of downtown Chicago.\n\nThe house evolved along with the seller\u2019s life. When Hollar\u2019s wife, Lisa Giles, moved in during the early 2000s, the couple embarked on renovations, beginning with the most radical move \u2014 removing an indoor pool that cut through the center of the two-level home. The couple replaced it with livable space, added wood floors, modernized the kitchen and reworked the outdoor areas with patios, landscaping and a small waterfall.\nThe property also features a bridge leading to an island in the pond, where the couple likes to drink wine by the firepit and listen to bullfrogs. Their expansive vegetable garden produces everything from beets to brussels sprouts, and for years, the grounds have been their weekend project and sanctuary.\nWith a new dog that doesn\u2019t travel well and a second home on Kiawah Island in South Carolina, Hollar and Giles said it was time to simplify.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The buyer borrowed\u00a0 $1.6 million for the site from Miami-based Sky 18 Capital.\nDave Preston and Jonathan Carter of Colliers represented the seller.\nAvery Cypress Creek will consist of one- and two-bedroom apartments, Meyers\u2019 website shows.\nThe site is in Uptown Urban Village, an area Fort Lauderdale officials and property owners have long targeted for more mixed-use development. The district is from McNab Road and the C-14 canal south to Northwest 57th Street, and from I-95 west to Powerline Road.\nIn 2019, Fort Lauderdale approved the master plan for the Uptown Urban Village.\nSince then, several developers have seized on the area. Grover Corlew is developing the 312-unit\nMayla Cypress\napartment project at 6261 Northwest Sixth Way. Last year, Fairfield Residential completed the seven-story, 295-unit Treo Apartments at 6500 North Andrews Avenue.\nAlso, Pinnacle wants to develop an affordable housing project with a\n100-unit building and a 96-unit building\nat 6250 North Andrews Avenue, according to Fort Lauderdale city records.\nMeyers Accesso\u2019s other South Florida projects include the 200-unit\nAvery Lake Worth\nwith two buildings completed last year at 3300 Boutwell Road in Lake Worth Beach. Last year, the joint venture paid\n$25 million\nfor the three-story Atrium at Broken Sound office building at 6111 Northwest Broken Sound Parkway in Boca Raton.\n\nThe Meyers Accesso joint venture was formed in 2022, according to Meyers\u2019 website.\nMeyers Group, led by CEO Alan Losada, is a developer and manager of market-rate and affordable apartments, as well as hotels and condominiums, according to its website. The firm was founded about a decade ago by the late Stuart I. Meyers, who died this summer at 83.\nMany of Meyers\u2019 multifamily projects are under its Avery brand. The firm develops much of its affordable housing by using low income housing tax credits, which are disbursed by the state.\nAccesso \u2013\u2013 led by Ariel Bentata, Moises Benzaquen and Claudio Dombey \u2013\u2013 was founded more than 20 years ago and has since owned and managed over $3.3 billion in properties, more than 18 million square feet of offices and more than 1,000 residential units nationwide, according to its website.\nIn January, Accesso paid\n$36.5 million\nfor the six-story Sawgrass Lake Center at 13450 West Sunrise Boulevard in Sunrise. The deal marked a 36.4 percent discount from the property\u2019s 2018 sale price.\nIn Chicago and Houston, Accesso has faced some\nheadwinds and financial woes\nfor its office holdings.\nSouth Florida\u2019s\nmultifamily\nmarket has calmed compared with the leasing and construction bonanza during the pandemic. Over the past year, slower in-migration and an oversupply of apartments have led to a drop in rents, slower leaseups and increased concessions.\nDevelopers starting projects now argue demand and rents will pick up again by the time they complete their buildings next year and in 2027.\nAlso in\nFort Lauderdale\n, Affiliated Development scored an\n$80 million\nconstruction loan in March for the eight-story The Era with 400 apartments at 2125 South Andrews Avenue. And Fuse Group is developing the eight-story Arcadian complex with 480 apartments and 15,000 square feet of retail at 640 Northwest Seventh Avenue.\n",

        "content": "When Brooklyn\u2019s luxury market\nnotched $115 million in contracts\nlast November, housing data guru Jonathan Miller said the contract volume was \u201cthe kind of number you don\u2019t really see.\u201d\nBut last week came close.\nThe borough netted over 35 contracts for over $108 million in contract volume between Sept. 29 and Oct. 5, according to Compass\u2019 weekly report for contracts signed for homes asking at least $2 million. The contracts comprised 12 condos and 23 houses.\nDuring the first week of October last year, the\nborough saw 15 contracts signed for over $56 million\n, and it was the strongest opening to the month since Compass began publishing its reports in 2020.\nThe top contract last week went to a Brooklyn Heights townhouse at 42 Monroe Place asking almost $8.9 million.\nThe 26.5-foot-wide home spans over 6,400 square feet and is laid out as a two-family with duplex residences on the first two and top two floors. Built in 1913, the home has been in the same family for 45 years.\nThe bottom two floors hold a 3,600-square-foot four-bedroom home with a living room, gallery and formal dining room. An extension from the dining room leads into a modern windowed kitchen and separate pantry, along with a home office, casual dining room and adjacent sun room.\nThe third and fourth floors span 2,800 square foot, with a three-bedroom residence. The fourth floor has three bedrooms, including a primary suite.\n\nCorcoran\u2019s Leslie Marshall and Nick Hovsepian had the listing.\nThe second priciest contract last week went to a penthouse at 524 Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint asking almost $6 million. The home, which traded in an off-market deal, set the record for priciest condo sale in Greenpoint,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously\nreported\n.\nPurchased in 2019 for $1.9 million by Ronen Segev, who owns piano reseller Steinway Pianos, the home set the record for the most expensive condo sold in Greenpoint.\nSegev undertook a $2 million renovation of the 1,780-square-foot duplex overlooking McCarren Park, outfitting the home with a custom western cedar round hot tub, outdoor kitchen and a heated cabana with a retractable roof.\nThe home comes with two bedrooms, three bathrooms and 680 additional square feet of outdoor space.\nCompass\u2019 John Chubet, who had the listing, previously listed the apartment for $8 million in 2022 before taking it off the market at the start of 2024. Nest Seekers\u2019 Cornell Jones brought the buyer.\nHomes put into contract last week had a median asking price of $2.75 million and an average price per square foot of $1,206. On average, the homes went for their last asking price.\n",

Racine, Wisconsin-based Johnson Bank, the financial institution owned by the Johnson family, provided a $21 million loan for the off-market purchase, records show.\nJohnson-Marquart is the daughter of the late Samuel Curtis Johnson Jr., the fourth-generation Johnson credited with growing the family business into a multibillion-dollar cleaning supply behemoth. He spearheaded the creation of several first generation aerosol products, including Glade air fresheners, Off! insect repellent and Pledge furnisher polish, according to published reports. His daughter, Johnson-Marquart, is married to music producer Mike Marquart, with whom she shares four children. Forbes estimates her net worth at $4.5 billion.\nThis marks at least her second purchase in\nPalm Beach\n. Her Southern Mark LLC bought the house at 449 Brazilian Avenue for $15.9 million last year, records show.\n\nRobinson is a novelist and the widow of Edward J. Robinson, who was the CFO of RJR Nabisco when it sold to KKR in 1988 for a then-record $25 billion, and inspired the film \u201cBarbarians at the Gate,\u201d according to published reports. He died last year.\nThe Robinsons bought the 7,500-square-foot Clark Avenue home, known as Villa Banyan, for $3.3 million in 1998, records show. It was built in 1929 on 0.4 acres and includes five bedrooms, seven bathrooms and a pool.\nThe couple listed it for $14.9 million in 2019, before taking it off the market in 2020, Zillow shows. Deborah Robinson is downsizing to a condo on the south end of Palm Beach. Records show she bought unit 503 at the Bellaria at 3000 South Ocean Boulevard for $9.4 million.\nThe sale marks the latest pricey deal in Palm Beach, where sales are picking up after the slow summer season. Last month, Jon Steinberg, a media executive known for founding Cheddar News, bought a spec home for\n$14.6 million\nin an off-market deal. Also last month, Lucerne Capital Management founder Pieter Taselaar sold his mansion for\n$29.5 million\nin an off-market deal.

        "content": "The fast-growing business of\nJack Harris and Michael Fahimian\nis now clocking over $76 million in Beverly Hills Flats deals this year with the duo\u2019s latest closing.\nThe Beverly Hills Estates agents confirmed the closing of 722 North Maple Drive this past week for $22.4 million, or about $2,571 per square foot. The duo represented a local family in its purchase of the home, while Keller Williams\u2019\nGary Gold\nwas the listing agent.\nThe off-market deal means Harris and Fahimian are now behind three of the five transactions in the tony Beverly Hills neighborhood that have closed above $20 million this year.\n\u201cWe have the market cornered,\u201d Fahimian boasted.\nThe\nHarris and Fahimian\nteam made their debut at\nNo. 20\non\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s recently released list of Los Angeles County\u2019s top 25 agents and teams, with 18 transactions totaling $200.8 million. The list reflects deals over $1 million recorded in the Multiple Listing Service between July 1, 2024 and July 1, 2025.\n\u201cWe\u2019re noticing a lot of deals being done off market in the Flats,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe\u2019re also noticing a lot of deals selling fairly close to ask, within 10 percent of the asking price.\u201d\n\nThe two said several factors are at play to benefit the Flats, which gets its name from the largely level terrain and large lots comprising the neighborhood between Sunset and Santa Monica boulevards. Among them are neighborhood\u2019s amenities, including the school district, police and fire services, the two said. More recent events have further fueled the area\u2019s popularity.\nMeasure United to House L.A., the two-tiered tax that applies to all property sales within the city of Los Angeles, makes Beverly Hills a good alternative for anyone looking to avoid paying the assessment. There\u2019s also the more recent concern around obtaining insurance, especially post-January\u2019s wildfires.\n\u201cAnother thing that\u2019s huge is the ability to get good insurance in the Flats because it\u2019s out of a fire zone,\u201d Fahimian said. \u201cA lot of the large carriers are still writing insurance policies in the Flats, whereas they are completely out of certain fire zones in Los Angeles and don\u2019t even offer insurance.\u201d\nSo far in 2025, home sales in the Flats have crept up to as high as $27 million. That\u2019s the highest price so far this year for the neighborhood, with two properties tied for the designation.\nCarolwood Estates co-founder and CEO Drew Fenton was the listing agent on the first $27 million deal, which closed in February, at 620 North Beverly Drive. Fahimian and Harris represented the buyer in that transaction, which penciled out to about $2,558 per square foot.\nIn June, Harris and Compass\u2019 Jessica Pasternak represented the seller, while Harris and Fahimian negotiated on behalf of the buyer for 521 North Canon Drive. The deal was recorded as closing for $27 million, or $1,641 per square foot. However, the buyer paid an additional $1 million for the property\u2019s furniture, according to the duo.\n",

A sale at that price would be $411,000 per unit. The property at 6-8 Locksley Avenue is under contract though a deal has yet to close.\nThe potential deal is a sign that multifamily investors are ready to bet on San Francisco again amid an increase in rents and artificial intelligence jobs in the city.\nA 332-square-foot studio apartment at Sunset Towers is advertised at $3,320, which is $10 per square foot. A one-bedroom is listed for $6.60 per square foot. The average rent price in San Francisco is just under $4.50 per square foot, according to Apartments.com.\nRents for Class A apartments in San Francisco are up 8.8 percent year-over-year, according to CBRE. Class B and C properties, meanwhile, have seen a growth of about 5.5 percent. Demand is reportedly being driven by tech workers, especially those in AI and related fields.\nThe data appears to support the idea of an AI-linked bounceback. For nearly two years, between mid-2022 and 2024, San Francisco had no sales of 100-plus-unit apartment developments, as investors weren\u2019t convinced the city was humming back to life.\n\nAvalonBay has believed for months that the\nAI boom is behind rising apartment rents\nacross the city. Housing demand has increased amid\nreturn-to-office mandates\n, improved public safety and AI-dominated job growth, according to AvalonBay COO Sean Breslin.\n\u201cAI is certainly a big part of that,\u201d Breslin told investors in May of the upward pricing trend, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nAvalonBay president and CEO Benjamin Schall told investors last month that sales across its portfolio could increase as rents and property values pick up.\nInvestors will likely be drawn to existing multifamily properties instead of sinking money into new construction. More than\n20,000 apartment units\nin San Francisco are in limbo as projects face years of delays or dissolve entirely. Last year, just 1,453 housing units were completed and plans were filed for 2,541 new homes, down from more than 5,000 delivered in 2020.\nAvalonBay\nowns nearly 3,400 apartments in San Francisco with a value of about $1.2 billion.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A slice of Panther Island could soon go vertical.\nThe City of Fort Worth will consider rezoning 15.4 acres near downtown to allow buildings as tall as 15 stories, paving the way for denser development on the long-stalled waterfront district. The proposed zoning covers land between North Commerce Street and the future Ring Road, and between Northeast Fourth and Fifth streets, near the Coyote Drive-In site at 223 NE Fourth Street, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The Fort Worth Zoning Commission is set to consider the case this week, with a City Council vote expected Oct. 21.\nThe change would bring density to an area largely limited to five-story projects, permitting taller towers and smaller structures within mixed-use developments, in alignment with the city\u2019s form-based code and canal-focused master plan.\nThe city has been pushing for years to activate the mostly underdeveloped 500-acre Panther Island, which spans public and private parcels just north of downtown. The\nproject\n\u2014 envisioned as a sprawling\ndistrict\nwith investments exceeding $1.1 billion \u2014 will also require new canal systems in order to mitigate flooding.\nThe canal network is central to the district\u2019s long-promised transformation, connecting two forks of the Trinity River north of NW 8th Street, according to a 234-page report issued last year by Consultant HR&amp;A Advisors and San Antonio-based Lake Flato architects. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers secured\n$403 million\nto aid flood control in 2023, opening up Panther Island to development.\nThe\nreport\nidentified areas of the north island\u2019s interior that could be developed before flood control improvements are in place.The consultant divided Panther Island into zones to prioritize development.\n\nThe first phase could focus on 12 acres along North Main Street, designated as a high-impact area for early development, and recent zoning changes have included increasing height limits to 20 stories and removing restrictions on building floor plate sizes.\nThe city aims to attract higher-density, transit-oriented growth to Panther Island. The study called access and connectivity to the island \u201cnotably inadequate,\u201d citing fragmented pedestrian infrastructure, including a lack of access to the Trinity Trail system.\nSusan Alanis, Panther Island program director for the Tarrant Regional Water District, told council members last month that the rezoning sets the stage for the first phase of canal construction, slated to start next year.\nA request for quotes from developers to design and build the canal system is expected to open this fall. The project is seen as a critical catalyst for private investment, which has been slow to materialize since the Encore apartments \u2014 a 300-unit complex with its own man-made waterway \u2014 were delivered in 2018.\nCity leaders have been methodically revising zoning across Panther Island to encourage higher-density construction. Last year, the council approved a change along North Main Street that lifted height caps to 20 stories and removed floor-plate limits for taller towers.\nIf approved, the latest rezoning could position the northeast section of the island for early redevelopment as\nFort Worth\nfinally moves from planning to pouring concrete.\n",

        "content": "The day after Mayor Eric Adams dropped his re-election bid, real estate donors turned to Andrew Cuomo.\nThe latest filings with the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board show that industry professionals gave more than $32,000 to Cuomo on Sept. 29, one day after Adams announced that he was suspending his campaign. When including donations given to Cuomo\u2019s campaign the day of\nthe mayor\u2019s announcement\n, that number climbs to roughly $41,000.\nThat\u2019s more than half of the $77,700 he took in from industry donors between Aug. 19 and Sept. 29, according to a\nTRD\nanalysis of campaign finance filings that included different real estate sectors, including development, property ownership/management, commercial, residential, architecture and construction. These totals include donors who self-reported working in the real estate industry or could otherwise be easily identified in filings.\nThe industry donations were part of a rush of contributions after Adams\nabandoned his campaign\n. During this reporting period, Cuomo received $895,000 in donations (when accounting for contributions that were refunded), with $380,000 coming in on Sept. 28 and 29.\nReal estate donors who gave the maximum of $2,100 in the six-week filing period include: A&amp;H Acquisitions\u2019\nAlex Adjmi\n, investor Yaacov Amar, Crown Acquisitions\u2019 Richard Chera, Coldwell Banker broker Emily Becker and United American Land principals (and brothers) Jody, Jason and Albert Laboz.\nRepublican donor and Florida developer Alan Keen, who was also\ninvolved\nin the Florida chapter of No Labels, a centrist group that pursued but eventually\nabandoned\nplans to nominate a third-party presidential candidate, also gave $2,100, as did Michigan-based shopping mall developer Robert Taubman.\n\nA few members of the Cayre\nfamily\ndonated on Sept. 29, including Cayre Equities\u2019 Ken Cayre, who gave $400 and Aurora Capital Associates\u2019 Robert Cayre, who donated $250. Aurora President Jared Epstein was one of several people who sent out an email\ncalling for donations\nto Cuomo after Adams dropped out of the race. The email stressed the need to \u201cdefend NYC against radical socialist policies,\u201d referring to frontrunner Zohran Mamdani, who is a Democratic Socialist.\nMeanwhile, Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa brought in $423,700, of which at least $11,750 came from industry donors. Landlord Jerry Lebedowicz was the only real estate donor to give the full $2,100. M&amp;N Management\u2019s Nikitas Drakotos and Bronx landlord Alan Feurman each contributed $500.\nMamdani received more than $410,000 during the six-week filing period, with at least $2,500 coming from donors working in real estate. The most he received from industry donors during this period was a $500 contribution from an affordable housing developer based in Sacramento, Calif. Still, some industry leaders have\nsignaled\nthat they plan to work with Mamdani if he wins in November.\nBefore the Democratic primary last summer, Cuomo was the clear favorite among the real estate industry. A\nTRD\nanalysis\nin June found that people in the industry donated more $500,000 directly to this campaign. Following Mamdani\u2019s win, the industry\nremained split\non\nwho to back\n.\nEven with Adams out of the race, Cuomo faces an uphill battle.\nA September poll\nby the New York Times and Siena University found that in order for Cuomo to meaningfully chip away at Mamdani\u2019s double-digit lead, Sliwa would need to drop out of the race.\nAfter Cuomo lost the June primary, Adams saw a spike in donations from the real estate industry. Following the\nindictments\nof some of his top-ranking officials, he dragged even further in the polls, trailing fourth behind Sliwa. As a result,\ncontributions slowed\n. The latest filings show some industry donations trickled to his campaign, but most of the disclosure features refunds to previous real estate professionals.\n",

        "content": "A hefty deal is in the works at a condo tower next to the Museum of Modern Art that\u2019s been plagued by discounts, slow sales and developer disagreements.\nUnit 65 at 53 West 53rd Street, asking just under $47 million, was the priciest Manhattan home to land a signed contract last week, according to Olshan Realty\u2019s weekly report. The full-floor apartment was one of 29 properties to find buyers between Sept. 29 and Oct. 5, up from 23 in the\nprevious period\n.\nThe building\u2019s developers \u2014 a group including Hines and Singapore\u2019s Pontiac Land Group \u2014 initially sought $51 million for the 6,400-square-foot pad in 2015, when they began marketing units off of floor plans. They dropped the asking price to just under $44 million when the apartment was listed on Streeteasy in 2017, before raising its price tag again four years later.\nThe home has four bedrooms and four bathrooms. It also features a corner great room and views of Central Park. Amenities in the 161-unit tower include a concierge, fitness center, lap pool and golf simulator.\nThe developers\ntapped Douglas Elliman\nto replace Corcoran Sunshine at the helm of sales at the project in 2021, following years of sluggish momentum and a series of controversial price cuts that pushed the developers into arbitration with each other. At the time, the building\u2019s projected sellout was lowered from more than $2 billion to $1.96 billion.\nElliman\u2019s Renee Micheli is the sales director at 53 West 53rd Street, with Elliman\u2019s Shari Scharfer Rollins, Jade Chan, Frances Katzen and Michelle Griffith all listed as representing the listing on Streeteasy.\n\nThe second most expensive home to snag an inked deal was a penthouse at Related Companies\u2019 520 West 28th Street, asking $35 million. The triplex last traded five years ago for $20 million, down from its initial asking price of\n$50 million\nin 2015.\nUnit PH37, which was redesigned by the seller, has five bedrooms, five bathrooms and 2,600 square feet of outdoor space spread between a balcony and roof terrace. The condo also features a great room overlooking the High Line, a hot tub and cold plunge pool.\nAmenities at the Zaha Hadid-designed building include a pool, garage, spa and fitness center.\nCompass\u2019 Hudson Advisory Team, including co-founders Clayton Orrigo and Stephen Ferrara and agent Arran Patel, had the listing.\nOf the 29 properties, 21 were condos, five were co-ops and three were townhouses.\nThis week\u2019s homes\u2019 combined asking price was $287 million, for an average price of $9.9 million and a median of $6 million. The typical home spent about two and a half years on the market and was discounted 9 percent from the original listing price.\n",

Christopher Leavitt with Douglas Elliman had the listing, and Gary Pohrer with Serhant brought the buyer.\nLahners bought the townhouse for\n$16.5 million\nin April. Her late husband, who died in 2021, was a partner with Center for Sight (CFS), an eyecare group with locations across the west coast of Florida. The partners sold CFS to US Eye for an undisclosed amount in 2019, forming the largest multi-specialty eye care organization in the state, according to published reports. Crystal Lahners remains a shareholder, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn February, Lahners listed her 2.7-acre waterfront estate at 8501 Midnight Pass Road in Siesta Key for\n$31.5 million\n, making it the Sarasota area\u2019s most expensive listing. She pulled the home from the market in July, shortly after listing the Palm Beach townhouse for $17 million.\nThe Brazilian Avenue townhouse was built in 2022 on 0.2 acres. Spanning 4,000 square feet, it has four bedrooms, five bathrooms and a pool, according to property records.\nWith the summer slow season over,\nPalm Beach\nsales are picking up, despite\na weakening South Florida market\n. Also this week, SC Johnson billionaire heiress Winifred Johnson-Marquart paid\n$30 million\nfor a landmarked home in an off-market sale.\nLast month, media executive Jon Steinberg, who is known for founding Cheddar News, paid\n$14.6 million\nfor a spec home in an off-market deal. Also last month, Pieter Taselaar, the founder of Lucerne Capital Management, sold his mansion for\n$29.5 million\nin an off-market deal. John Sculley, the former CEO of Apple, and his wife Diane Sculley also sold an oceanfront estate for\n$37 million\n.",

The vote affirms a previous decision by the Los Angeles City Planning Commission to allow the development to proceed.\nUnder Vermont Real Estate\u2019s plan, the car wash, located near Barnsdall Art Park at the busy intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and North Vermont Avenue, would be replaced by a seven-story building with 139 studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments. The ground floor would feature a grocery store and residents would have access to parking for 145 vehicles.\nBecause of its proximity to the Vermont/Sunset Metro station, the approved plans for the project include Transit Oriented Communities\naffordable housing\nincentives, clearing the way to build a larger building than zoning rules would normally allow. The developer would have to set aside 16 of the new apartments for affordable housing for extremely-low-income Angelenos. For one person to\nqualify\n, they would have to make $31,850 or less annually; a household of four would be limited to an income of $45,450.\nDesigns are being handled by Daryoush Safai, per Urbanize. The contemporary podium building would come with an outward-facing courtyard against Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nThe Supporters Alliance for Environmental Responsibility (SAFER), an affiliate of Laborers International Union of North America Local 270 (LIUNA),\nfiled an appeal\nagainst the project that led to its latest bureaucratic snag. That appeal came after a previous one before the Planning Commission in October 2024 was rejected.

        "content": "Michigan City, Indiana, once defined by smokestacks and factories, is rewriting its story as a beachside escape \u2014 and a Chicago suburb in all but name.\nOfficials and developers in the city are leaning on luxury projects, improved rail access and the pull of Lake Michigan beaches to shift the northwest Indiana town\u2019s blue-collar identity.\nThe 33,000-resident city, about 60 miles from downtown Chicago, has attracted several major developments, including Farpoint Development\u2019s SoLa, a $300 million hotel and townhouse project marketed to second-home buyers and short-term renters. The 188 planned residences start in the $400,000s, with completion expected in 2027 or 2028, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. Indianapolis-based Flaherty &amp; Collins is building The Franklin, a $100 million mixed-use tower near the new train station that\u2019s set to open in 2026.\nThe momentum follows last year\u2019s completion of a second Metra South Shore Line track and new station, which cut the train ride to Chicago to about an hour. The improved commute has made\nMichigan City\nviable for professionals\npriced out\nof the city but unwilling to give up its amenities \u2014 a zoo, a lighthouse, outlet shopping and a casino \u2014 or its proximity to the Indiana\nDunes\nNational Park, which draws about 3 million visitors annually.\nDevelopers\nare taking note. Deron Kintner of Flaherty &amp; Collins told the outlet that Michigan City has character.\n\n\u201cWith the speed to get to Chicago and back, we think it\u2019s going to be very desirable to live in,\u201d Kintner said.\nFarpoint Development\u2019s Scott Goodman said the town\u2019s mix of affordability and access makes it \u201calmost a suburb.\u201d\nMichigan City\u2019s renaissance does have hurdles. The coal plant and cooling tower looming over its lakefront is derided locally as \u201cthe monstrosity.\u201d Operator NIPSCO plans to close the facility by 2028 but may instead convert it to gas power.\nThe state prison nearby, also slated for closure, could eventually open prime redevelopment land. Mayor Angie Nelson Deuitch said the goal is to attract newcomers without pushing out residents.\n\u201cWe want industry, but tourism is a big part of who we are now,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Stanley Cayre,\nthe eldest of three Cayre brothers\nwho turned their fortune in a home video company into a real estate and apparel empire in New York City and beyond, has died.\nA funeral was held on Sunday, October 5, at Magen David Congregation in Brooklyn, according to a notice from Ohel Moshe Synagogue in Manhattan. No cause of death was provided. Cayre\u2019s age at the time of his death was also not provided, but records show he was 89 years old.\nStanley ran apparel company The Cayre Group with his eldest sons. Stanley\u2019s youngest son, Bobby Cayre, founded\nAurora Capital Associates\nand built the company into a major landlord with luxury properties in the Meatpacking District and Soho.\nPart of one of the most prominent families in New York\u2019s Syrian Jewish community,\nStanley\n, Kenneth and Joseph Cayre have remained under the radar and rarely speak to the press.\nThe Cayre family business started with a Miami Beach souvenir shop Stanley\u2019s father ran in the 1950s, where the brothers worked. Joseph Cayre told\nThe Real Deal\nin 2008, the job was initially essential for the family to survive financially, but eventually led to much of his future business success.\n\u201cYou would sell a lot of stuff, but you were really selling yourself,\u201d he said.\nThe Cayres launched various businesses, including factories that made pantyhose and eight-track cassette tapes, before charting a path in the entertainment industry.\n\nIn 1974, Stanley and his brothers founded Salsoul Records, a label credited with\nreleasing the first available 12-inch disco disc\n. They later started\na home video company\n, Good Times Entertainment, that distributed fitness videos and titles deemed \u201cmockbusters.\u201d In GoodTimes\u2019 version of \u201cThe Little Mermaid,\u201d an aquatic princess, Lena, sets her sights on Prince Stefan.\nVideo game subsidiary GT Interactive went public in 1995 amid a wave of popularity of first-person shooter games such as Doom, Mortal Kombat III, and Total Annihilation. It raised $140 million in its initial public offering and was acquired by Infogrames Entertainment in 1999.\nThe three brothers divested from GoodTimes and started their own private family offices. Stanley, along with his eldest sons Jack, Amin and David, founded The Cayre Group, a wholesale apparel company focusing on baby, kids, and women\u2019s apparel.\nKenneth started\nTreasure Island Storage\n, which grew to one of New York\u2019s largest privately held self-storage companies.\nJoseph founded Midtown Equities, a real estate investment firm known for deals like the\n2012 purchase of Soho House\nand investing in the Battery Maritime Building\u2019s repositioning to Casa Cipriani in 2018. Midtown Equities was also involved in the World Trade Center development with Silverstein Properties and Goldman Sachs.\nStanley was the husband of Frieda Cayre and the father of five children, Jack Cayre, Amin Cayre, David Cayre, Bobby Cayre and Grace Shalom, according to the notice from Ohel Moshe.\nCayre Group and various members of the Cayre family did not return a request for a comment.\n",

        "content": "With the number of casino contenders slashed in half, the real competition for a license in New York may boil down to two teams.\nMany consider existing slot parlors \u2014 MGM Empire City in Yonkers and Queens Aqueduct Casino, operated by Resorts World \u2014 to be shoo-ins for two of the three state casino licenses up for grabs.\nThat leaves New York Mets owner Steve Cohen\u2019s Metropolitan Park and Bally\u2019s Bronx.\nFor simplicity\u2019s sake,\nThe Real Deal\ndecided to compare these two proposals, which many are already pitting head-to-head. That being said, the playing field is still open, the two racinos may not clinch the deals \u2014 and it\u2019s also possible the Gaming Commission won\u2019t award all three licenses.\n\u201cThis is a tabula rasa,\u201d Brian O\u2019Dwyer, chair of the commission, said during a Sept. 30 meeting. \u201cThere are no front-runners or favorites.\u201d\nCohen, who is teaming up with Hard Rock International, wants to turn 50 acres of parking lots near Citi Field into a casino complex that includes a 1,000-key hotel, a 5,650-person live music venue and 25 acres of green space. The team has billed the project as a way to turn the Flushing, Queens, ballpark into a year-round destination and to keep Mets fans onsite after games.\nThe Bally\u2019s casino would be built on 16 acres of parking lots and practice-green area at Bally\u2019s Golf Links at Ferry Point. The project would include 500 hotel rooms and a 2,000-seat entertainment venue.\nThe golf course is city-owned land, which is managed by Bally\u2019s. The company acquired the golf course\u2019s lease from the Trump Organization in 2023. If it secures a casino license, as part of that 2023 deal, it must pay Trump $115 million,\naccording to the New York Times\n.\nThe state\u2019s Gaming Facility Location Board is expected to decide who receives a casino license by Dec. 1. The state Gaming Commission will then issue the licenses before the end of the year.\nUnlike\nthe Community Advisory Committees that eliminated four of the eight casino proposals last month \u2014 which were supposed to determine the projects\u2019 fates based on the input of the nearby neighborhoods, but members often appeared beholden to the politicians who appointed them \u2014 the board has specific criteria for evaluating the projects. The body will consider four different categories, with \u201ceconomic activity and business development\u201d carrying the most weight (making up 70 percent of each proposal\u2019s score).\n\nThat category includes a project\u2019s estimated revenue and taxes, as well as the number of jobs it will create and how much these employees will be paid. Other factors in this category include how quickly the casino can be built and proof that it can be fully financed.\nMetropolitan Park is larger than Bally\u2019s and is expected to bring in more revenue and annual taxes. The team has said that the site is shovel-ready, and construction will begin in January if it obtains the license in December. The project is expected to be complete by June 2030, according to the team\u2019s application.\nConstruction on Bally\u2019s would begin eight to nine months after receiving a license.\nThe other categories, worth 10 percent each, include local impact siting, workforce enhancement and diversity framework. The first pertains to ways the project teams are working to minimize the impact of their projects on surrounding communities and how they will work with and promote local businesses. The last two focus on various aspects of employee hiring, training, retention and diversity.\nThis information is laid out in the teams\u2019 applications, to varying degrees. Some details, including financing, are not readily available, given that the applications are heavily redacted. Metropolitan Park\u2019s application states, however, that the development team will use a combination of debt and equity to finance construction of the project, noting that if it faces any unexpected challenge in lining up debt, \u201cthe partners are financially stable enough to raise the additional capital.\u201d\nHere\u2019s how Bally\u2019s and Metropolitan Park\u00a0stack up. The breakdowns are not exhaustive and only include factors that can be easily compared, i.e. numbers.\n",

The mansion and guest house were completed last year. The couple is likely related to the Donatucci Kitchens &amp; Appliances family based in Pennsylvania.\nThe property was asking $31.2 million with Leslie Leopold and Cheri Tindall of Ocean Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. Serhant\u2019s\nAngel Nicolas\nrepresented the buyer.\nLeopold and Nicolas declined to comment on the buyer\u2019s identity in the purchase, which was first reported by the\nWall Street Journal\n.\n\nThe property features 150 feet of private water frontage, including a dock, boat ramp, beach and two pools, according to the listing. It includes a 7,600-square-foot main house and a 2,700-square-foot guest house.\nThe previous record home sale in the Florida Keys was the $23 million trade of an Islamorada mansion called Palm Harbor.\nPortnoy also owns a home in Miami. He paid\nnearly $14 million\nfor a nine-bedroom, eight-and-a-half-bathroom house in Miami\u2019s Morningside in 2021, then a record for the neighborhood. Before he acquired his Miami home, Portnoy was\nreportedly\nrenting Floyd Mayweather Jr.\u2019s former Miami Beach house for $200,000 a month.\nPortnoy founded Barstool Sports, then a sports and gambling blog company, in 2003. In 2022, majority stakeholder Chernin Group announced it was selling 50 percent of Barstool to Penn National Gaming, in a deal that valued the company\nat $450 million\n. But Portnoy bought the digital media company back from Penn Entertainment for $1 in 2023, as part of a larger deal that included a brand licensing agreement with ESPN. Barstool is based in Chicago.\n",

        "content": "The former headquarters of Zendesk is now under lender control.\nLenders have seized ownership of the 77,225-square-foot 1019 Market Street building at a foreclosure auction, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The unnamed entities placed the winning bid at $10.3 million after the borrower stopped making payments on a $33.5 million loan backed by the property.\nPrior to the lenders\u2019 purchase, the previous owner was 1019 Market Street LP, reported to be an affiliate of an investment fund managed by Deutsche Bank,\naccording\nto the Business Times. The ownership bought the property for $48.3 million, or $625 per square foot. A Morningstar appraisal in August placed the building\u2019s value at $14.7 million \u2014 a notable fall from its appraisal price of $71.4 million in 2019, according to Cred IQ\ndata\ncited by the Business Times.\nThe trustee,\nChicago Title Company\n, filed a notice of mortgage default in April on behalf of the lenders. The following month, lenders alleged in a lawsuit that the building owner stopped making its monthly payment on the $33.5 million loan linked to the building in February. The owner was identified as Deutsche asset management arm DWS. A month later, Chris Neilson of Trigild was appointed the building\u2019s receiver.\n\nZendesk\nsigned its lease for the 1019 Market building in 2013, a year before 1019 Market Street LP affiliate bought the building. In 2021, Zendesk paid $7 million to terminate its lease. The company exited the building in 2022 and\nplanted its flag at 181 Fremont Street\n; the 1019 Market building has been vacant ever since, aside from a retail tenant in a small ground-floor commercial space.\nHow the lenders proceed with the Mid-Market building after the\npurchase at foreclosure auction\nremains to be seen. They could move to sell the building to a new buyer at a lower price than was available to previous ownership. In doing that, a future owner would have more flexibility as to how to deal with and invest in the building.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The latest donation numbers are in for NYC\u2019s mayoral race.\nUnsurprisingly, some real estate folks threw money Andrew Cuomo\u2019s way after Mayor Eric Adams dropped out of the race.\nMore than half\nof the funds he received from industry folks were donated the day of and after Adams announced he would not seek reelection.\nHere are the totals (including campaign refunds this reporting period) from Aug. 19 to Sept. 29:\nAndrew Cuomo: $895,000\nFrom real estate: $77,700\nZohran Mamdani: $410,000\nFrom real estate: $2,500\nCurtis Sliwa: $423,700\nFrom real estate: $11,750\nMeanwhile, various political action committees continue to draw tens of thousands, in some cases hundreds of thousands, of dollars. A quick overview of the latest donations shows more of the same spending patterns among industry professionals and some surprises.\nNotably, Toll Brothers President David Von Spreckelsen gave $2,500 to OneNYC, a PAC backing Mamdani, just a few days before Adams abandoned his campaign. Within the industry, affordable housing developers appeared to be the first to publicly warm up to the idea of a Mamdani administration. Real estate trade group leaders have also said they\nexpect to work closely\nwith Mamdani if he becomes mayor.\nThe Solomon Organization, a New Jersey-based development firm, gave $35,000 to New Yorkers for a Better Future Mayor 25, an anti-Mamdani PAC, in September. Abro Management\u2019s Richard Scharf contributed $25,000 to the PAC in August, but the amount wasn\u2019t reported until last month. An LLC tied to Berndt Perl, co-founder of APF Properties, gave the PAC $2,500 in August, which was reported this month.\nElizabeth Tisch, married to Jon Tisch, CEO of Loews Hotels, gave pro-Cuomo PAC Fix the City $50,000 last month. In the lead-up to the primary, Fix the City raked in millions from real estate donors.\nKamson Corporation CEO Richard Kurtz donated another $50,000 this month to Anyone but Mamdani, a PAC formed by private investigator and\nformer\nAdams ally Bo Dietl. Kurtz gave the PAC $50,000 in August as well.\nJust days before Adams\u2019 exit, cryptocurrency billionaire Brock Pierce gave $1.1 million to Empower NYC, a super PAC backing Adams. Pierce apparently is urging Adams to change his mind,\nper the New York Daily News\n.\n\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nIf you could ask each of the mayoral candidates one real estate-related question, what would it be? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nThe\nNYC chapter of the League of Women Voters is endorsing most of the housing-related measures that will appear on the ballot Nov. 4. The group is not taking a position on the question that asks voters if an appeals board should take the place of the mayoral veto in the city\u2019s land use review process. Instead, the group has listed pros and cons of the measure\non its website\n.\nThe fight over the ballot questions continues this week with a press conference held by the City Council and various labor unions to \u201chighlight the misleading language and negative impacts\u201d of the questions. Open New York is holding its own rally next week to promote the proposals.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\nNassau County Supreme Court Justice Bruce Cozzens on Monday upheld a local law that bans transgender women and girls from participating in women\u2019s sports at county-run facilities\n,\nGothamist reports\n. The New York Civil Liberties Union plans to appeal.\n\u2014 Mayor Eric Adams is in Albania this week to \u201cmeet with the prime minister, business and tech leaders, tour factories, and discuss new opportunities to boost economic activity and tourism to New York City,\u201d a City Hall spokesperson told\nNBC New York reports\n. The cost of the four-day trip is partially being covered by the Albanian government,\naccording to Gothamist\n. This comes exactly one week after Adams dropped his reelection bid \u2014 and roughly a year after the mayor was\nindicted\non corruption charges that included accepting travel benefits from Turkish officials. The charges were ultimately\ndropped\n.\n\u2014 ICYMI: Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop is in the running to take over for Kathryn Wylde as president of the Partnership for New York City,\nthe New York Post reports\n.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$16.2 million\nfor a condominium unit at 220 Central Park South. The 2,400-square-foot condo is a new construction unit.\nThe Corcoran Group\u2019s\nDeborah Kern had the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$168.6 million\nfor 113-117 West 24th Street in Chelsea.\nIn 2013\n, Gary Barnett sold the 270,000-square-foot site to John Lam, who redeveloped the parking garage space into two hotels.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$27.8 million\nfor a condo unit at 432 Park Avenue. The condo is 4,500 square feet. Peter Ashe has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 85,479-square-foot, 14-story, mixed-use building at 114 Bruckner Boulevard in the Bronx. Samuel Wieder of S. Wieder Architects is the applicant of record. \u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "Democrat Ben Chou is trying to unseat Republican City Council member Vickie Paladino in northeast Queens. Why should the industry care? Because competitive races reveal which way the pendulum is swinging on key real estate issues.\nOne thing is clear: Candidates do not see the housing shortage as a safe topic in single-family neighborhoods.\nPaladino, a Trump-style conservative, opposes any development that would change the character of her district. That fuzzy argument has been used by Republicans and Democrats alike against all manner of rezonings and projects \u2014 even accessory dwelling units.\nThe City of Yes for Housing Opportunity was a good example. It was explicitly designed to add a little housing in every community, but not the same amount in every community, to avoid changing their character.\nIt was proportional, meaning dense areas like Midtown South would get more units than low-scale neighborhoods such as College Point, Whitestone, Bayside, Douglaston and Little Neck, all of which Paladino represents. Yet Paladino railed against City of Yes.\nQueens politicians who are primarily polemicists (\nPaladino\n) or entertainers (Curtis Sliwa) portrayed City of Yes as The End of Queens as We Know It. I try to ignore Paladino\u2019s\npropaganda\nand Sliwa\u2019s\nshtick\n. The more oxygen they consume, the less there is for serious debate.\nFortunately, Paladino and her conservative colleagues were unable to sabotage City of Yes, which passed the Council 31 to 20 \u2014 not on partisan lines, but geographic ones. This\nCity Limits map\nshows a crescent-shaped swath of \u201cno\u201d votes across the farthest-from-Manhattan neighborhoods where, not coincidentally, the least housing has been built.\nChou cannot possibly be worse than Paladino on housing development. But will he be better? His website doesn\u2019t even mention the issue, although land use is the Council\u2019s most important power and the city has a severe housing shortage.\n\nThat\u2019s because a pro-development platform might well be suicidal for a Council District 19 candidate.\nWhat does play well there? Protecting large residential buildings from the city\u2019s\ncarbon emissions cap\n.\nChou\u2019s website says he will \u201csave co-ops from the burden of Local Law 97.\u201d His explanation: \u201cWe cannot fight climate change by putting the cost on the backs of working- and middle-class homeowners. Local Law 97 is an important and well-meaning law, but it places an unfair burden on co-ops and condos.\u201d\nChou proposes extending and expanding the J-51 tax break to help co-ops and condos reduce their emissions.\nPaladino \u2014 unlike Chou \u2014 opposes Local Law 97. But, realizing she cannot repeal it, she also wants a salve like J-51. She also introduced a bill in 2023 to\npush back Local Law 97\u2019s deadlines\nby seven years. (It didn\u2019t pass.)\n\u201cMy bill seeks to\nbuy time\n,\u201d she said then. \u201cYes, I\u2019m opposed to the law, but if it has to happen, we have to do it wisely. If we\u2019re going to push these drastic climate bills, it would be nice if there was a J-51 type of tax break.\u201d\nIt makes sense, politically, to offer help to co-ops and condos large enough to be subject to Local Law 97. Queens politicians love their co-ops and condos. Just don\u2019t ask them to allow any more to be built.\n",

        "content": "Tom Comforte is looking to cash out while the cranes are still swinging in Fulton Market.\nThe West Loop landowner put his site at 1240 West Carroll Avenue on the market, seeking to ride the apartment wave reshaping the corridor\u2019s western edge, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nComforte tapped CBRE brokers Tom Svoboda and Dominic Soltero to find a buyer for the parcel, which sits between two development sites owned by Sterling Bay, according to marketing materials. The property could yield up to 123 residential units on its own, or as many as 239 if a buyer also secures two small adjacent lots from Sterling Bay.\nThe listing comes as apartment developers swarm the former meatpacking district, betting on surging rents and long-term demand despite a tough financing climate.\nComforte, whose family once ran HVAC firm Climatemp out of Fulton Market before decamping to Broadview, has gradually offloaded holdings as the neighborhood evolved from industrial to mixed use hotspot.\nTwo major projects are already advancing nearby.\nSterling Bay\nis under contract to sell most of the 1200 West block of Carroll to developer Tom Roszak, who plans a\n29-story tower\nwith 398 apartments. One block west, Sterling Bay is shopping its site at\n1300 West Carroll\n, where the city signed off last year on a 700-unit proposal.\n\nRoszak told the outlet that Comforte\u2019s land was in play while he pursued his own deal but said the new listing won\u2019t alter his project, which still needs city council approval.\nEven with construction loans scarce and interest rates high, Fulton Market\u2019s housing pipeline keeps expanding. Chicago-based LG Group recently filed plans for a five-story, 66-unit building a few blocks south at\nKinzie and Racine\n, underscoring the neighborhood\u2019s resilience.\nComforte hasn\u2019t set an asking price for his Carroll Avenue property, and neither he nor Sterling Bay returned requests for comment. But with residential developers circling and the city\u2019s westward growth showing few signs of slowing, Comforte may find now is the right moment to sell.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n\n\n",

Coincidentally, the outpost will be in the former Jeffrey\u2019s Toys store, the inspiration behind the \u201cToy Story\u201d films, which closed in January 2024 amid decreasing foot traffic\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a vibe shift happening in the area,\u201d O\u2019Connor told the Standard. \u201cThings are looking up, and we wanted to be part of that story.\u201d\nOther tenants have been moving in in recent months. A watch shop called Clicky Bezel and wedding boutique Chien &amp; Buffle have opened their doors. In August, a John Varvatos store debuted on the strip, joining other menswear shops like Suit Supply, which recently renewed its lease, and Hugo Boss, which is reportedly in the market for a Union Square space, including a potential Maiden Lane shop.\n\nRetailers aren\u2019t the only ones planting flags on Maiden Lane. Just as the\nartificial intelligence boom\nis\ngobbling up office space\nin the city, commercial spaces above the pedestrian street are attracting AI startups.\nEnterprise AI platform Writer, for example, moved this year into an upper-floor space.\nKaizen, another AI company, recently signed a lease for\nMaiden Lane offices\n. The price point for office space could be a draw for many firms. Class A offices in the Financial District lease for upwards of $65 per square foot, while offices in Union Square and Maiden Lane lease for $38 to $49 per square foot.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The purchase marks one of the largest deals ever for Rocket, Bloomberg first\nreported\n.\nRocket has been on a tear this year, announcing its $14 billion acquisition of Coppell-based Mr. Cooper and its $1.75 billion deal for home-search platform\nRedfin\nwithin three weeks of each other. The purchase of Seattle-based Redfin closed in July, solidifying Rocket\u2019s plan to vertically integrate the process of buying, selling and financing homes.\n\u201cBy combining mortgage servicing and loan origination, along with home search through Redfin, we are paving the path for Americans to own the dream,\u201d CEO Varun Krishna said.\nThe merger with\nMr. Cooper\nunites two of the country\u2019s biggest mortgage players. Rocket is one of the largest originators in the U.S., while Mr. Cooper ranks as the nation\u2019s top mortgage servicer. Together, they\u2019ll manage more than $2.1 trillion in home loans \u2014 roughly one in every six mortgages nationwide.

The company cut about 2 percent of its\nworkforce\nin July, soon after closing the\nRedfin deal\n, citing redundant roles across overlapping divisions.\nRocket\u2019s move to dominate every stage of the housing market mirrors strategies by tech and financial giants chasing end-to-end control of consumer transactions.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Houston\u2019s pickleball scene is getting another major player.\nThe Picklr, a fast-growing Utah-based chain, is making its Texas debut with multiple locations planned across the metro area \u2014 part of an international blitz by one of the sport\u2019s biggest franchises, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe company favors adaptive reuse, pouncing on\nbig-box\navailability for quicker openings, but it\u2019s also building out clubs in new developments.\nThe Picklr opened its first Houston-area club, at 8920 Barker Cypress Road in Cypress, a former ASI Gymnastics. The 18,200-square-foot facility includes\npickleball\ncourts and a pro shop, with discounted memberships going for $129 a month.\nThe company plans a February opening for a 66,500-square-foot complex at 16590 Interstate 45 in Conroe, a former Burlington store. The $900,000 remodel, designed by Chicago-based DXU Architects, will house 20 courts and make it one of the largest pickleball centers in the state.\nThe Picklr has also leased space for a 35,000-square-foot venue in District West, Ferguson Family Partners\u2019 $170 million mixed-use project rising in Cinco Ranch. That location is scheduled to open late next year.\nMore leasing opportunities are coming down the pike. Another five\nHouston-area\nPicklr clubs are expected by the end of 2027, though sites haven\u2019t been disclosed.\n\nThe company\u2019s investors include Chaifetz Group, Navigator Partners and Pickleball Inc., the parent company of the PPA Tour.\nIts rapid rollout is national: The Picklr opened its 50th club this month in Littleton, Colorado, and says another 70 are in the pipeline. More than 500 franchise agreements have been sold across the U.S., including 16 locations across the Texas Triangle.\nWhile most clubs are franchised, the company keeps some corporate-run sites to test products and programs. The three Houston locations each have different local franchisees.\nInternationally, The Picklr is extending its reach to Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand through master franchise deals. It\u2019s also partnering with JLL to scout markets in Europe.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Lurin Capital didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nThe guaranties were on loans tied to three Texas properties and 12 Florida properties. The Florida portfolio started being sold at foreclosure auctions in April. The loans tied to the properties totalled $383.6 million.\nVenetos is also fighting a\nrecent lawsuit from Select Securities Europe\n, a lender from Luxembourg that claims he defaulted on 15 loans totaling $40.5 million.\n\nVenetos launched Lurin Capital with his wife Ashley after he was axed by hedge fund Citadel. He told a podcast in 2022 that Lurin builds on his family\u2019s 60 years of experience in multifamily real estate.\nHe explained the pivot from finance: \u201cThe opportunity to extract outsize returns with a relatively manageable amount of risk was far greater in real estate.\u201d\nThe Venetoses launched Lurin in 2016 among a wave of upstart real estate operators who planned to make money by purchasing Class B apartment complexes, updating them, raising rents and selling them at a profit.\nLurin\u2019s website says the firm owns 46 properties across five states, but the list includes assets that have faced foreclosure.\nInterest rates threw sand in the gears for many of them, increasing debt service on their floating-rate loans and raising construction costs. At the same time, Texas, a hotspot for value-add multifamily operators, was absorbing a historic wave of apartment development, causing rental rates and occupancy levels to fall.\nAs a result, experts anticipate\na wave of multifamily distress in Texas\n, where about $19 billion in CMBS loans tied to multifamily is set to mature in the next five years.\n",

That brings the state\u2019s footprint at the tower to more than 117,000 square feet.\nThe asking rent on the expansion, which covers the building\u2019s top two floors, was $85 per square foot.

The space was set to be used as Governor Kathy Hochul\u2019s personal office, as well as a press office and working space for her staff.\nThe Office of General Services explored potential leases at 40 buildings, touring 20 of them before picking 919 Third Avenue. At the time of the lease, it was said to be negotiating for more space, the result of which appears to be the latest deal.\nOther tenants at the building include law firm Schulte, Roth &amp; Zabel; law firm Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo; and\nBloomberg\n.\nIn the third quarter, tenants in Manhattan\nleased 9.4 million square feet\n, a 2 percent jump from the second quarter and almost 27 percent higher than the five-year quarterly average, according to a Colliers report. Leasing volume surpassed 30 million square feet for the full year, surging past pre-pandemic levels and representing the strongest period of year-to-date demand since 2002.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A group of unit owners hired brokers to sell their waterfront building in North Bay Village, near Related Group and Macklowe Properties\u2019 planned two-tower luxury condo tower project.\nNearly all of the Harbor Condominium owners tapped Blanca Commercial Real Estate and MSP Group to sell the 29-unit, circa-1951 building at 7909 to 7911 East Drive on Harbor Island, said Blanca\u2019s Cary Cohen, and Deme Mekras and Sam Mekras of MSP.\nThe 0.54-acre property is unpriced, but \u201cWe expect this to shatter the North Bay Village record,\u201d Cohen said. Deme Mekras said the current record for land sales is $744 per square foot, which would come out to more than $17.6 million.\nA developer could build 38 units and up to 150 feet tall, or about 15 stories; or up to 50 units with 195 feet of transferable development rights that the buyer could purchase from the city or a private seller, the brokers said.\nDeme Mekras said the property will be a short walk to the planned island walk promenade that\u2019ll be part of Sunbeam Properties\u2019 planned development.\u00a0 The billionaire Ansin family\u2019s Sunbeam Properties owns 14 acres in the village and plans to build a\n7.3 million-square-foot\ndevelopment with roughly 2,000 residential units, 300 hotel keys and commercial space.\n\u201cTo be walkable to that, it\u2019s going to be pretty special,\u201d he said.\nCondo associations that may have deferred maintenance, repairs and the full funding of their aging buildings for years are now playing catch-up, thanks to condo safety laws passed after the deadly condo collapse of Champlain Towers South in Surfside more than four years ago. The cost of insurance has also soared.\n\n\u201cRather than maintaining aging structures that require substantial capital investment, they are making the strategic decision to capitalize on the soaring value of their location,\u201d Cohen said in the release, adding in an interview that the association\u2019s monthly dues would create \u201cmore of a burden than a benefit.\u201d\nSome unit owners and associations have instead opted to sell their condos to developers in bulk.\nRelated and Macklowe bought out the owners of the Biscayne Sea Club co-op and the Majestic Isle condo building on the northern tip of Harbor Island, though both deals were previously tied up in litigation. The developers plan two nearly 500-foot condo towers on their assemblage of more than 4.1 acres. In July, North Bay Village commissioners\nunanimously passed\na zoning ordinance via a special area plan that will allow the project to move forward. Arquitectonica, led by Bernardo Fort Brescia, is the architect.\nOn the west side of Harbor Island, S2 Development recently sold the\n1-acre development site\nat 7913 West Drive to El-Ad National Properties. The waterfront lot is approved for a 22-story, 94-unit residential tower.\nNorth Bay Village, a three-island town sandwiched between Miami and Miami Beach, has a number of other residential and mixed-use projects planned.\nThe Eichner family\u2019s Continuum Company controls 4.5 acres in North Bay Village, including the former Shucker\u2019s and Best Western property. This summer, the commission unanimously\napproved\na special area plan, site plan and development agreement for the entire Continuum Waterfront District, which calls for two condo towers, a 200-key Continuum hotel and a marina. One tower can now be up to 440 feet tall.\nMikael Hamaoui\u2019s Riviera Horizons plans the 28-story, 70-unit\nPagani-branded condo tower\nat 7940 West Drive on Harbor Island, marking the first condo development for the Italian hypercar brand. Shoma Group plans Shoma Bay, a mixed-use condo tower with a Publix supermarket, at 1872 79th Street Causeway.\nDeveloper Vivian Dimond also took over a stalled\n21-story, 54-unit\ncondo project at 7918 West Drive on Harbor Island, with plans to complete the building next year.\n",

Instead, DOF capped their benefit at $16.5 million, citing outdated filing rules, according to the lawsuit.\nThe dispute turns on when the project \u201cofficially\u201d began.\nDanforth filed its first ICAP application in 2014, but the developer filed renewed permits in 2017. Over time, escalating costs from pandemic delays pushed the budget far past initial estimates.\n\nThe developers asked to shift the project\u2019s start date from 2015 to 2017 so the tax calculation would reflect its completion in 2023. DOF allegedly refused, saying the request relied on ICAP rules that didn\u2019t exist when the original application was filed.\nThat timing gap, the lawsuit claims, was the city\u2019s fault. The lawsuit stated that DOF waited nearly a decade after state and city lawmakers created ICAP in 2008 to finalize implementing regulations \u2014 a lag that the lawsuit says violated separation-of-powers principles and undermined the program\u2019s purpose.\nA DOF spokesperson defended the decision, saying the agency administers programs \u201cwithin the parameters established by state and local law.\u201d\nDanforth founder Steven Williams declined to comment to the outlet.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Walgreens Boots Alliance is shutting down its massive workspace in Chicago\u2019s Old Post Office and consolidating operations at its suburban Deerfield headquarters, the company confirmed Monday \u2014 a major reversal of its pre-pandemic urban expansion strategy.\nThe move was announced five weeks after Walgreens completed its $10 billion sale to New York private equity firm Sycamore Partners. In an email to employees, the new CEO Mike Motz said the company \u201cmust make bold, decisive choices to free up resources\u201d and that bringing its Chicago-area workforce under one roof would \u201cenhance collaboration\u201d and improve support for store teams, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nWalgreens plans to close the downtown office by the end of January. The company leased roughly 200,000 square feet at the Old Post Office at 433 West Van Buren Street in 2018 \u2014 a high-profile deal that helped kick off the building\u2019s transformation into a modern corporate hub. At the time, Walgreens said up to 1,800 employees could eventually work there, a symbol of its push to attract younger, tech-oriented talent in the city.\nThat vision never fully materialized. The Old Post Office lease runs through 2032, according to CoStar, and it\u2019s unclear whether Walgreens will sublease the space or negotiate an early exit. Either scenario would deal another blow to a downtown office market battered by record vacancies and rising distress.\nA spokeswoman for the building\u2019s owner, New York-based 601W Companies, declined to comment. In 2019,\n601W\ncompleted an $800 million overhaul of the Old Post Office building.\n\nThe Deerfield consolidation also fits into a broader downsizing trend for Walgreens\u2019 real estate footprint. Last year, the company sold 18 acres of its corporate campus to Atlanta-based homebuilder\nPulte Group\n, which is developing single-family homes on the site. A year ago, Walgreens began\nclosing\n1,200 of its 8,000 stores nationwide.\nMotz, a former Staples retail chief installed by Sycamore, is leading Walgreens through a sweeping restructuring after years of weak performance, mounting debt and failed bets on healthcare ventures such as\nVillageMD\n.\nThe company\u2019s breakup into five standalone private entities \u2014 including its core pharmacy chain, Boots Group in the U.K. and Shields Health Solutions \u2014 marks the most significant overhaul in its 120-year history.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The owners of\n3612 Crescent Avenue in Highland Park\nseemed to command the high ground of the Texas market last month. With an asking price of $18.5 million, the mansion, held by the family trust of a Stanford University trustee and a Morgan Stanley wealth manager, was the second-most expensive listing in the state. Located in one of Dallas\u2019 most desirable neighborhoods, the home has a top-performing Compass agent and glowing coverage in local media.\nThe rub? The home had already listed\nlast year\nfor $19.5 million, stalled, relisted in January and left the market in August before reentering with a $1 million price cut in September.\nThe Crescent Avenue mansion isn\u2019t alone. As the\nSun Belt shifts in favor of buyers\n, prices are lowering and market time is lengthening for Texas\u2019 most luxurious homes.\nWhile prices have risen nationally, luxury home transactions fell 0.7 percent to a 10-year low in August,\naccording to Redfin\n. In this metric, Texas is strongly outperforming Florida, which has undergone the most drastic change; luxury deals declined by 27 percent in West Palm Beach and 19 percent in Miami. Austin is the only major Texas metro to experience a decline in luxury trades, and its 0.4 percent fall is slightly shallower than the national average.\nHowever, Austin, Dallas and Fort Worth all chart higher-than-average days on market for homes above $1 million, and the price history of the state\u2019s top homes suggests that demand for ultra-luxury in Texas might be on the wane.\nIn Dallas,\nthe state\u2019s leading luxury metro\n, agents are optimistic about the general luxury class.\n\u201cThe $3 million-plus segment is thriving,\u201d said Bryan Pacholski, chief sales officer of Compass\u2019 Dallas office. Dallas/Fort Worth saw 338 luxury transactions in the second quarter of 2025 compared to 232 the prior year, according to Pacholski, amounting to a 46 percent increase year over year.\n\nThe lower stratum of luxury is more sensitive to lending, said Douglas Elliman agent Breah Brown, who calls North Texas luxury \u201cpretty resilient.\u201d\n\u201cInterest rates are affecting that first-home buyer, and here, that\u2019s around the $2 million, $2.5 million dollar mark. Of course, you\u2019ve got condos and stuff that are under a million, but first-home buyers are really in that range,\u201d Brown said.\nHowever, the ultra-luxury lane is noticeably slowing. Of the 40 most-expensive properties in Texas to list since June, only one has sold, according to the Houston Association of Realtors. The average luxury home sold in 46 days in August, three days slower than last year, according to Redfin. Most of the state\u2019s 40 priciest listings have already exceeded this average.\nFurthermore, the new listings aren\u2019t that new. September had a higher concentration of relistings compared to prior months.

        "content": "It\u2019s official: A long-stalled megadevelopment in Brooklyn has a new development team that will take over seven sites and, in a new twist, pay $12 million toward an affordable housing fund.\nA\njoint venture\nled by Cirrus Real Estate and LCOR has scooped up the remaining sites that make up Pacific Park, a massive project that was launched\nmore than two decades ago\n. Through a foreclosure auction on Tuesday, the joint venture took over the development rights to six rail yard sites, after Greenland USA defaulted on nearly $350 million in loans tied to the properties.\nBeyond Cirrus and LCOR, the joint venture taking over the sites includes U.S. Immigration Fund and Fortress, but those firms won\u2019t have an active role in managing the development.\u00a0Terms of the project restructuring were not immediately available. USIF confirmed the deal Tuesday afternoon.\nAhead of the auction, the state blessed Cirrus and LCOR as new developers of the sites, which include the rail yard properties \u2014 to be developed once platforms are built over the tracks between Pacific Street and Atlantic Avenue \u2014 and another located near the Barclays Center, known as site 5. Greenland is still part of the joint venture that will develop that site.\nThe latter was not included in Tuesday\u2019s auction and is being transferred through a separate, private deal.\nAs part of an agreement with the state, the joint venture will pay $12 million toward an affordable housing fund, of which $4.5 million would be paid upfront, according to state officials. The money, which will be paid in installments, is intended to fill in for penalties that were supposed to kick in when the current\ndeveloper\n, Greenland USA, failed to finish the project\u2019s remaining 876 affordable apartments by May 2025. Under a 2014 agreement, failing to meet that construction deadline meant the developer must pay $2,000 per unfinished unit for every month that the apartments went without a temporary certificate of occupancy.\nBut Empire State Development, the state agency overseeing the project, halted those fines and\ntied them to new deadlines\n, the first of which was quickly missed.\nStill, the agency once again\ndeclined\nto enforce the penalties, citing concerns that Greenland would sue over the fines and further delay the project.\nThe $12 million payment isn\u2019t as much as would likely have been collected if the 2014 agreement were enforced (a two-year delay on all the units would result in a $42 million fine, for example). Elected officials and BrooklynSpeaks, an advocacy group that was party to the 2014 agreement, have railed against the state\u2019s decision not to enforce the penalties, viewing it as a betrayal of the community\u2019s trust.\nIn this next phase of the project, ESD plans to set new benchmarks for the project. If a memorandum of understanding outlining the project isn\u2019t signed by July 31, 2026, the state agency could still collect the damages described in the 2014 agreement, dating back to June 1. Those damages would take the $12 million payment installments into account.\nA decades-long project\nThe mixed-use development has been in limbo for several years. First proposed in 2003 with the name Atlantic Yards, Greenland began taking over the then-long-stalled project in 2014 and rebranded it Pacific Park. The rail yard \u2014\u00a0a key part of the \u201cblight\u201d that empowered the state to take over the sites through eminent domain and lease them out to developers \u2014 went untouched, and concerns over Greenland\u2019s ability to finish the project mounted.\n\nIn 2022, Greenland\ndefaulted\non $350 million tied to the rail yard sites from Nick Mastroianni\u2019s USIF, which raised the capital through the cash-for-visas EB-5 program. Fortress Investment Group also owns a stake in the debt.\nThe fact that ESD has approved the joint venture and that the development rights have been transferred for the six sites means that the project can enter the next phase \u2014 whatever that may look like.\u00a0The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has also signed off on the team, which has agreed to make annual payments of $11 million related to air rights tied to the rail yards.\nThe new developers have indicated that they want to make changes to the earlier plans, which called for more than 6,400 apartments, 2,250 of which would be set aside as below market-rate. So far, nine buildings (including the Barclays Center) have been completed as part of the project, with more than 3,200 apartments built, by original developers Forest City Ratner, Greenland USA and other developers who, over the years, have taken over individual sites.\nUSIF\u2019s Nick Mastroianni said he expects the plan to be reworked and finalized over the next year and half. The first phase, which involves building the first of two platforms over the rail yards, will cost an estimated $4 billion and take roughly five years to complete, he said. The second phase will cost another $2 billion. He said the development team has \u201cideas on how to bring the affordable housing\u00a0to reality sooner rather than later,\u201d but wouldn\u2019t share details on what the team envisions for the site. He noted that\nsome of the sites\nwill qualify for the now-expired property tax break 421a.\nMastroianni described the transfer of the sites as a turning point for the project and its EB-5 investors.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve now advanced the project so that we can develop, and the development will be the trigger for the [loan] repayment on a unit by unit basis,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a light at the end of the tunnel for the return of their capital.\u201d\nWhat comes next\nChanges to the plan will require amendments to the state\u2019s general project plan, a method outside the city\u2019s land use process that lays out the parameters of a project. ESD indicated that it will kick off a public engagement process to discuss the development team\u2019s proposals in the coming months.\nIf the history of Pacific Park is any indication, that process will be tense: The project has been held up as an example of what happens when developers promise big, fail to deliver and then walk away unscathed. BrooklynSpeaks has called for deeper affordability levels than originally planned.\nOther suitors circled Pacific Park, including\nRelated Companies\n. Cirrus\nconfirmed\nin January that it was pursuing the project, and LCOR emerged a few months later.\nCirrus has said that it will lead capitalization on the project, and LCOR comes in as an experienced multifamily developer. Cirrus\u2019 website provides little information about the company\u2019s development experience, but the firm\u2019s principals collectively have overseen \u201c$150 billion in real estate finance transactions, $10 billion in real estate equity investments and more than 10,000 multifamily units,\u201d according to a company spokesperson.\nCirrus has seen its portfolio of projects in the city grow since reaching an agreement last year with the Building and Construction Trades Council and City Hall to invest $100 million in multifamily workforce housing and redevelopments by pooling pension funds from more than a dozen construction unions. The fund, which raised $300 million as of July, will help finance development at Pacific Park, as well as workforce housing at a\ndefunct airport\nin Queens and tens of thousands of units of housing as part of an agreement with Resorts World Casino New York City.\nLCOR, which is also working with Cirrus on the Queens project, oversees a portfolio of 10,000 multifamily units and 2.4 million square feet of commercial space, according to the firm\u2019s website. Cirrus is led by Joseph McDonnell, who was formerly head of real estate at BlueMountain Capital, and Tony Tufariello, who served as head of real estate finance at Morgan Stanley and head of global real estate at Fortress, which is also part of the joint venture.\n",

        "content": "Morgan Properties bought a 300-unit apartment complex near West Palm Beach for nearly $70 million, amid an uptick in South Florida multifamily investment sales.\nConshohoken, Pennsylvania-based Morgan purchased the gated garden-style property at 4860 Sand Stone Lane in unincorporated Palm Beach County from Miami-based Bar Invest Group, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The deal breaks down to $233,167 per unit.\nThe buyer paid $69.95 million for the complex and financed it with a $49.9 million Freddie Mac loan.\nThe complex, called Visions at Willow Pond, consists of 17 two-story and three-story apartment buildings, a clubhouse and one warehouse, Vizzda records show. It was completed in 1986 and 1987 on a 30.4-acre site.\nBar Invest, a major South Florida multifamily landlord, had paid $56.2 million for the property in 2020, according to records. Bar Invest is led by Herve Barbera.\nMultifamily investment firm Morgan, led by Mitchell Morgan, has been ramping up its apartment purchases nationwide this year. After it purchased an 11-property portfolio with more than 3,000 apartments in eight states for\n$501 million\nin April, its total multifamily holdings topped 100,000 units nationwide.\nIn August, Morgan reached a deal to purchase a majority stake in Toronto-based publicly traded Dream Residential REIT for $10.80 per share, or about\n$354 million\n. After the purchase, which is expected to close by year-end, Dream will go private.\n\nMorgan is considered the largest private multifamily owner in the U.S.\nIn South Florida, Morgan owns the 180-unit Tuscany Pointe at Somerset Place at 23126 Post Gardens Way near Boca Raton; the 191-unit Savannah Place at 22356 Calibre Court near Boca Raton; the 202-unit Royal St. George at the Villages at 1441 Brandywine Road in West Palm Beach; and Village Place at 2111 Brandywine Road in West Palm Beach, according to the firm\u2019s website.\nSeveral South Florida multifamily investment sales have closed in recent months, after a slowdown during the past two years due to elevated interest rates and more skittish lenders. The tri-county region had become a magnet for newcomers during the pandemic, which had prompted unprecedented apartment demand and record rent growth. The in-migration slowed just as developers also completed a record number of units last year, slowing lease-ups and increasing concessions.\nDuring the pandemic, Palm Beach County apartment investment sales reached $3.8 billion in 2021 and $1.8 billion in 2022, according to data from Avison Young. This dropped to $668 million in 2023 and $1 billion last year. Multifamily investment sales for the first half of this year in the county totaled $120.6 million, the Avison data shows.\nMany of the buyers still purchasing are relying on Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae loans, which usually offer better terms than bank financing.\nThis month, Tishman Speyer paid\n$124.5 million\nfor the 270-unit Bell at Broken Sound Apartments at 5500 Broken Sound Boulevard Northwest and 950 Northwest Broken Sound Parkway in Boca Raton. The buyer financed the purchase with a $78.4 million Fannie Mae loan.\nIn July, Brookfield Properties bought the 444-unit Turtle Cove complex at 825 Cotton Bay Drive East in unincorporated Palm Beach County for\n$107.5 million\n. The deal was part of Brookfield\u2019s $1.6 billion purchase of a 7,300-unit portfolio of 23 properties from Miami Beach-based Starwood Capital Group.",

Arizona-based 3Edgewood, the real estate firm led by former Phoenix Suns owner\nRobert Sarver\n, bought 600 West Chicago earlier this year for just $89 million \u2014 a steep drop from its $510 million sale price in 2018. The firm is pitching upgrades like outdoor terraces, bars, and a rooftop deck to lure tenants amid rising vacancy.\n\nAny relocation would mark a major shift for the Big Ten Network, which debuted in 2007 as the first college sports\nconference-owned\nTV channel, broadcasting football, basketball and dozens of Olympic sports from its Chicago studios. The network has since grown alongside the conference, which ballooned from 11 to 18 teams after recent expansions into the West Coast.\nThe two options reflect differing strategies in a struggling office market. The property at 350 North Orleans Street has been in receivership since\nBlackstone\nhanded back the keys last year when its $310 million loan came due. Receiver Trigild and leasing agent Lincoln Property Company are seeking tenants as the building\u2019s appraised value plummeted to $87.4 million from $489 million in 2018.\nPrudential Plaza owner Wanxiang America Real Estate, on the other hand, recently negotiated a loan extension through 2027 \u2014 at 130 East Randolph Street and 180 North Stetson Avenue \u2014 pledging more than $50 million in\nupgrades\n, landing tenants including ComPsych, HOK, AECOM and Howard &amp; Howard.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The artificial intelligence boom in the Bay Area is driving demand for more than just apartments for incoming workers.\nAs AI barons move into town, the San Francisco real estate market is experiencing a shortage of mansions, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. Luxury listings that once sat on the market for months are now drawing multiple offers within days.\nTake a 5,000-square-foot\nmansion in the tony Pacific Heights neighborhood\nthat went into contract last month with a sale price of about $9.4 million. It\u2019s roughly the same price it sold for eight years ago, but at the time, nearly four months passed before an offer came in.\n\u201cIt was a difficult house at the time,\u201d luxury broker Peter Rodway, senior partner at Neal Ward Properties who worked to sell the Jackson Street home in 2017 and now, said of the property. \u201cThis time, buyers were just banging at the doors to get into it. An offer came in on the first day, at full price.\u201d\nAI startups\nare growing, stock options are turning into cash and high-paid tech workers are returning to the \u2014 all ramping up demand in the high-end market.\n\u201cThe future wealth in AI is out and touring homes right now. Some of them are touring $2 million condos. Some of them are touring $20 million houses. That wealth effect is going to continue to help drive demand,\u201d Gregg Lynn, a luxury agent with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, said.\n\u201cThe city is just flush with cash right now \u2014 and there\u2019s not enough inventory to keep up with it,\u201d Rodway added.\n\nSales for luxury homes are up 14 percent year-over-year in San Francisco, according to Redfin data cited by the Chronicle. Inventory, meanwhile, is down by about 4.5 percent year-over-year.\nFor the months of June through August, total\nhome sales\nregardless of price were up by 4.2 percent compared to the same period last year. This September saw a massive uptick from the same month last year, with overall home sales last month in San Francisco being up 35 percent year-over-year.\nAdditionally, San Francisco was the only county in the Bay Area to see a year-over-year increase in its \u201cpending ratio,\u201d which compares demand versus supply.\n\u201cSan Francisco\u2019s pending ratio leapt higher by 15 percentage points, an enormous rise. We ascribe the large shifts in the market to its rapidly accelerating AI startup boom,\u201d Patrick Carlisle, chief market analyst at Compass, said. October could be even bigger, as it\u2019s \u201ctypically the big month in fall for closed luxury sales\u201d in San Francisco. As it stands, 15 sales of homes over $5 million are pending and expected to close this month.\nCBRE predicts\nthe explosion of AI will bring more than 50,000 tech workers to San Francisco by the end of the decade. Just how much AI juices the once-slumping San Francisco market in the coming years remains to be seen.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Todd Nepola is clapping back at the networks and production company of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Miami\u201d for allegedly distorting reality about him.\nNepola\n, a Hollywood-based commercial real estate investor, filed a defamation lawsuit in Miami federal court on Tuesday against cable network Bravo, its parent company NBC Universal, and Los Angeles-based Purveyors of Pop, which produces the hit television series documenting the everyday drama of seven rich and successful women, some of whom are recent divorcees like Alexia Nepola.\nIn March, the Nepolas finalized their divorce, but their breakup was among the salacious plotlines in the most recent seventh season of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Miami,\u201d which also introduced a new cast member hailing from South Florida\u2019s real estate industry: Shoma Group President\nStephanie Shojaee\n.\nNepola and his attorney, Scott Weiselberg, declined to comment. Spokespersons for Bravo, NBC Universal and Purveyors of Pop did not respond to email requests for comment.\nIn his complaint,\nNepola\nalleges that \u201cThe Real Housewives of Miami\u201d producers knowingly manufactured and amplified an ongoing storyline that falsely depicted him as being in financial distress. The lawsuit asserts that Nepola has a net worth exceeding $100 million, and that he\u2019s never faced financial trouble in his life.\n\nThe producers also reused video footage of him from seasons four and five of the show as fodder for seasons six and seven, allegedly without his consent. Nepola had agreed to appear in the previous seasons, which aired in 2022 and 2023, when he and Alexia Nepola were engaged, and included a finale episode in season five showcasing their nuptials.\nThe alleged on-air defamation occurred across several episodes in seasons six and seven when \u201cThe Real Housewives of Miami\u201d cast member Adriana de Moura dished rumors about Nepola in front of the camera. According to the complaint, in one episode, de Moura says, \u201cA little bird told me that Todd and Alexia are having some trouble\u2026and they might have to break their lease and find a cheaper place.\u201d\nNepola\nalleges that when he confronted producers, \u201cthey did not care,\u201d the complaint states. During the time producers aired the episodes intimating that he was struggling, Nepola closed more than $115 million in real estate deals across 11 transactions, the lawsuit states.\nIn July, an affiliate of Nepola\u2019s Current Capital Group paid\n$33 million\nfor a Miami Gardens shopping center.\nThe alleged defamation extends beyond the episodes during season six and seven, as Bravo has re-aired allegedly snippets depicting or mentioning Nepola in a negative light on the network\u2019s social media accounts, \u201cThe Real Housewives of Miami\u201d reunion shows and other media platforms, the complaint states.\n\u201cThe defamatory story lines forged by the RHOM producers are completely devoid from reality,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. \u201cEach new broadcast serves to reignite and revalidate the false narrative, reinforcing the public\u2019s belief in its accuracy and renewing the emotional and reputational harm.\u201d",

At the time, JRE Partners was known as Julius Real Estate Partners and was a division of J.P. Morgan. It split off and rebranded as JRE Partners in 2022. The hotel reopened in 2020 as 21c Museum Hotel Chicago after the landlord spent $33.5 million in upgrades.\nIn February 2024, JRE put the hotel up for sale, hiring JLL brokers Adam McGaughy, John Nugent, Mark Jindra and Nick Sullivan to market the property. But it never traded, until ACORE moved to seize the asset through the deed in lieu, which allows borrowers to avoid a lengthy foreclosure process by turning over a property\u2019s keys and control.\n\nJRE borrowed $67.5 million from ACORE to finance the purchase in 2018. In 2019, JRE and ACORE agreed to increase the mortgage amount to $73 million.\nJRE Partners and ACORE Capital did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe takeaway marks ACORE\u2019s second recent action in the Chicago hotel distress market. The lender in August filed a\n$187 million foreclosure lawsuit\nagainst local hotelier Su-Mei Yen over allegedly unpaid debts tied to two South Loop properties totaling 368 rooms with another 85 extended stay suites at one of them.\nCheck back for updates on this developing story.",

        "content": "Developer Leo Birov is planning what will likely be two new houses on the site of a lakefront Kenilworth mansion that he bought for $6.8 million last month.\nBirov, whose wife and business partner Milena Birov was the buyer\u2019s agent on the transaction, confirmed in a voicemail to\nThe Real Deal\nthat he was the buyer of the property and the developer of an upcoming spec mansion that went on the market this week. The Birovs operate Heritage Luxury Homes, which develops and sells mansions on the North Shore.\nThe Birovs could not be reached for further comment.\nThe new listing at 501 Sheridan Road in Kenilworth, first reported by Crain\u2019s, is for an 11,000 square-foot mansion on one of two lots the previous house occupied. The planned mansion has seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms, and is asking nearly $6 million.\nThe listing advertised a 0.56-acre lot, which matches the smaller of two parcels the previous house was on, according to Cook County records. That parcel faces Sheridan Road and does not have lakefront access. Construction is expected to be completed next year, according to the listing.\nIt\u2019s likely that the second parcel, which is 0.93 acres and has lakefront access, will be the site of another new development, but there hasn\u2019t been a listing for a second house at the location.\n\nThe current house at the address, an 11,000 square-foot estate with five bedrooms and nine bathrooms, was built in the 1960s and expanded in 2006. It was last owned by the late Robert and Yadelle Sklare, and the sale was managed by their family.\nWhen the\nhouse sold last month\nafter major price cuts, the listing agent, Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Nancy Nugent, said the buyers would likely tear down the house for new construction. Most potential buyers who made offers on the house were also interested in tearing down, Nugent said.\nThe property entered the private market in 2021 asking $14 million. It underwent several price cuts before its final listing price of $7.7 million, and it eventually closed for $6.8 million.\nThe sale price makes it one of the most expensive houses sold in Kenilworth in recent years. One mansion on Sheridan Road brought in a record $11.75 million in 2020, and another Sheridan Road property sold for $9.5 million in 2021.\nHeritage Luxury Homes is marketing another spec mansion in Glencoe asking $5.7 million.\nA home developed by the Birovs sold for $4.7 million in Glencoe in June, and they have sold at least two new homes in Wilmette: A $2 million Sunset Drive home in 2024, and a 9,000 square-foot French Colonial house on Michigan Ave for $4.8 million in 2022.\n",

        "content": "Two Dallas real estate firms are teaming up on a $650 million plan to transform one of Preston Hollow\u2019s busiest corners into a dense, walkable mixed-use hub.\nBurk Interests\nand Greenway Investment Company are seeking a zoning change to redevelop 7 acres at the southwest corner of Preston Road and Royal Lane into a project with twin high-rises, offices and restaurants, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nThe proposal, across the street from Central Market, at 5924 Royal Lane, calls for a 325-foot, 28-story tower with a hotel and condos; a 275-foot, 24-story apartment building; and two office structures. The site\u2019s current zoning caps height at 54 feet, meaning the plan would need a significant city sign-off before moving forward.\nGFF Design\nis the project architect, and Dallas-based\nOJB Landscape Architecture\nis handling the landscape plan.\nThe taller of the two buildings would house about 150 hotel rooms and fewer than 100 for-sale condos, while the shorter one would hold roughly 200 rental units. The developers said the project will replace a sea of asphalt with a more pedestrian-friendly layout anchored by a half-acre green space. Nearly all parking will be underground, save for a few surface spots, and plans include planting more than 100 mature trees \u2014 partly to restore the canopy lost when a 2019 tornado swept through the area.\n\n\u201cThis is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to define a very special future for this site,\u201d Burk Interests president Leland Burk told the outlet. The developers also intend to add a traffic signal and crosswalk on Preston Road, along with 1,000 linear feet of sidewalk improvements.\nThe Preston-Royal intersection, known for its postwar retail and tangle of parking lots, could see a dramatic shift if the project is approved from what exists along\nPreston Hollow\ntoday, said GFF\u2019s Evan Beattie.\nBurk\u2019s firm has owned the land since 2017 and is positioning the site, less than a mile from the Dallas North Tollway, as a rare infill opportunity. Zoning approvals could take several years; Burk estimates the project could start by 2028 following neighborhood input sessions.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The selection was confirmed by the group\u2019s board and executive committee.\nFulop, whose third and final term as Jersey City\u2019s mayor ends in January, brings both public and private-sector chops.\nFulop has overseen an explosion of development in Jersey City, which between 2010 and 2021 permitted about three times as many homes per capita as New York City. In the process, Fulop has lured the Big Apple\u2019s biggest developers \u2014 including\nSilverstein Properties\n,\nTishman Speyer\nand Related Companies \u2014 across the Hudson.\n\nUnder his watch, massive towers have sprung up along the waterfront and in a rejuvenated Journal Square, where the nearly century-old Baroque movie palace Loew\u2019s Jersey Theater is undergoing a $130 million renovation that will create a performance venue with 3,000-plus seats.\nPart of his legacy in Jersey City includes supporting the construction of more than 10,000 residential units, putting more than 18,000 additional units in the pipeline.\nWylde\u2019s departure marks the end of an era for the Partnership, which represents the city\u2019s top corporate leaders and serves as a conduit between business, labor and government. Under her watch, the group became a central voice in policy debates around housing, taxes, public safety and the city\u2019s post-COVID economic recovery.\n\u201cI am humbled to take the reins from Kathy Wylde, who built the organization into the influential force it is today,\u201d Fulop said in a statement, noting the Partnership\u2019s reach across the city\u2019s largest employers, which collectively provide more than 1 million jobs. Wylde said she expects a\nsmooth transition\n.\nFulop will officially assume his post next year as\nWylde caps more than four decades\nshaping New York\u2019s civic and economic landscape.\n",

A different MCM fund will maintain partial ownership,\naccording to CoStar\n, which first reported the deal.\nA spokesperson for MCM, which shares an address with Magna Hospitality Group but is a separate company, declined to comment.\nThe portfolio includes the Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square North, the Motto by Hilton New York City Chelsea, the leasehold for the DoubleTree by Hilton New York Times Square South and the leasehold for the Fairfield Inn &amp; Suites New York Midtown Manhattan Penn Station.\nThe firm will\nkeep a minority stake\nafter trading more than 90 percent of its equity in the properties, Crain\u2019s reported.\nJLL brokered the deal, which marks the largest Big Apple hotel sale since the\nSafe Hotels Act\nwent into effect in May. Critics of the law predicted that it would hurt the value of nonunion hotels by increasing expenses and eroding their cost advantage. So far, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.\n\nMCM bought the 21-story hotel building at 30 West 46th Street from Concord Hospitality\nin 2021 for $88.5 million\nand opened the 196-key Hilton Garden Inn New York Times Square North. The firm sold the property for $115.5 million.\nA deed recorded with the city shows a sale price of $92 million but does not include the personal property value that is part of the final sale price, a source said. City National Bank provided a $77 million loan for the purchase, property records show\nMCM bought the hotel property at\n113 West 24th Street\nin Chelsea for $74.2 million in 2019, when it was still under construction. It opened the 374-key Motto by Hilton in December 2021 and sold it for $222 million. A deed filed with the city shows a sale price of $168.6 million. Apollo Global Management provided a $105 million loan.\nA limited liability company tied to MCM took over the leasehold of 523 Eighth Avenue in 2021 in a deal valued at\n$47.4 million\n. It sold the 320-key Times Square property,\u00a0 a DoubleTree by Hilton, for $99.8 million.\nMCM paid $57.4 million to buy the senior loan and take over the leasehold for the 239-key Marriott at\n325 West 33rd Street\nin 2020. It sold the property for $52.3 million.\nThe relationship between Magna and MCM is unclear. Magna is known for scooping up distressed hotel properties and went on a Manhattan buying spree during the pandemic. In July, MCM made a credit bid of $10 million for Joe Moinian\u2019s Midtown Hilton Garden Inn in a U.C.C. auction, giving it a pathway to take over the property.\n",

A separate, restored guest house has one bedroom and one bathroom. During his time as owner, Balbes added a pool and a one-bedroom, two-bathroom pool house to the property.\nElsewhere outside, the property features a boulder-lined pond next to a gravel driveway and lush gardens. Balbes added nearly 70,000 plants to the property as part of its revamp.\nThe buyer won\u2019t have to go far to stay active or entertained.

        "content": "Downtown Chicago could look radically different by 2045 under a sweeping new blueprint that imagines more than 100 million square feet of development and a population more than doubling to 300,000.\nThe Department of Planning and Development drafted its Central Area Plan 2045, set to go before the Plan Commission this fall, laying out a two-decade roadmap for private investment, infrastructure and land use across the Loop and surrounding areas, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe framework emphasizes housing, public space and transit improvements over office expansion, reflecting how the city hopes to adapt its struggling business district into a mixed-use neighborhood built for residents as much as workers.\nHeidi Sperry, the city\u2019s lead planner for the central area, called the plan a \u201cframework\u201d for making downtown \u201cas livable and as vibrant as we possibly can.\u201d That means building apartments \u2014 a lot of them. Consultants estimate downtown could add as many as 68,500 housing units over the next 20 years, largely rentals, and absorb as many as 126,000 residents.\nThe city projects demand for more than 100 million square feet of development based on population and job growth, available land and\nvacancy trends\n. Roughly one-third of that footprint could come from redeveloping vacant or underused parcels. While demand for office and retail space is weak, the plan assumes existing vacant inventory and ground-floor retail in mixed-use projects will meet near-term needs.\nMuch of the new housing supply is expected to come from office-to-residential conversions, an approach the city has already begun to subsidize along LaSalle Street. The draft calls for more conversions and zoning tweaks to support higher density on smaller sites, citing recent projects at 65 East Wacker Place and 500 North Michigan Avenue as examples.\nHousing diversity and affordability are recurring themes. Planning Commissioner Ciere Boatright said the goal is to ensure that the office security guard or waitress can live downtown, not just\nhigh earners\n.\n\nThe plan encourages incentives for family-sized apartments and workforce housing for residents earning between 60 percent and 120 percent of area median income. Long-term, the city aims to expand support for affordable\nownership\nmodels such as land trusts and down-payment programs.\nTo serve a denser\ndowntown\n, the draft calls for more grocery stores, child care and K-12 options, along with retail subsidies to strengthen street-level activity. Developers are expected to respond to market realities \u2014 as one broker told the outlet, \u201cLet\u2019s get them open and occupied and then see what could be needed.\u201d\nTransit is another centerpiece. The plan backs new CTA stops on the Brown and Pink Lines, a long-discussed Metra commuter rail station in Fulton Market, and extending the Riverwalk north and south. The city also wants to explore infill Red Line stops and more robust water taxi and bus connections.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

When it picked up the 166,500-square-foot property two years ago, it committed another $50 million to renovating the building. That would put the cost at $300 per square foot.\nThe renovation will add two floors to the building, previously known as\n60 Spear Street\n, including a rooftop event space and restaurant with a panoramic city view, and in the basement, a luxury spa with a sauna and two pools. The updates include an open-floor-plan lobby with an Arsicault Bakery location.\nPresidio Bay is the latest to redevelop a San Francisco office building into an upscale destination for tenants wanting offices swirling with amenities.\nDemand is building, but there is no new supply, said Presidio Bay Managing Principal Cyrus Sanandaji. The firm calls the development an\n\u201coffice resort\u201d\namong the trend of \u201cflight to experience.\u201d\n\u201cWhen every building has the same amenities, nothing differentiates one from the other,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you have then is just a commodity. And there\u2019s already plenty of that.\u201d\n\nMayor Daniel Lurie is hoping to make it easier for office building owners to create amenity spaces for tenants, in hopes of beating down San Francisco\u2019s office vacancy numbers. Lurie\nproposed legislation\nin May that would let downtown building owners bypass the approval process and transform ground-floor commercial spaces zoned for retail into nonretail office amenities like gyms and lounges.\nSanandaji said the process for this project was speedier than usual, and the building is projected to open in about a year.\n\u201cThree years ago, San Francisco was redlined,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, investors are looking around the country for the best place to get a return, and they\u2019re finding it here, where there are sales to be had and the market is about to run up.\u201d\nEach floor at 88 Spear is about 17,000 square feet, with floors three through six connected by a staircase.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to pigeonhole ourselves in terms of tenants,\u201d said CBRE\u2019s Chris Famulener, who\u2019s in charge of leasing. \u201cWe have lofty expectations for the rents we want to hit, so it has to be a group that\u2019s excited about what\u2019s going on there.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Artimus Construction is switching sales teams at Circa Central Park \u2014 again.\nThe developer hired Nest Seekers to take over the remaining eight units at the 285 West 110th Street project, adding another brokerage to a long list of firms tasked with offloading condos since sales launched eight years ago.\nNest Seekers\u2019 vice president of new development sales, Xiao Rui Lin-Ruan, will spearhead marketing at the building. Rui said she was introduced to the team at Artimus by the developer of 145 Central Park North, a neighboring luxury development where she has led sales for nearly two years. She found a buyer for the building\u2019s last unit just last week.\nThe developers \u201clooked at our success selling the final residence to see what they could switch up,\u201d Rui said.\n\u201cCirca is further along, but the remaining inventory is similar,\u201d she added, pointing to the mix of three- and four-bedroom units. The developers \u201cbuilt both of these buildings with larger layouts\u201d because they anticipated demand for more space would be higher among buyers attracted to the Central Park-adjacent location.\nPrices of the unsold units range from around $2.4 million to $4.8 million. A team with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices is still representing one of the remaining condos, Unit 5G, though a spokesperson for Nest Seekers said the apartment will transfer to the firm if it hasn\u2019t sold by Nov. 1, when the existing exclusive agreement is set to expire.\n\nCorcoran agent and former \u201cMillion Dollar Listing New York\u201d cast member Steve Gold previously led sales at the project, including\nsnagging a record deal\nfor the penthouse. Gold sold the 3700-square-foot apartment in 2018 for $9.4 million, which was at the time the most expensive sale in uptown Manhattan.\nTwo years later, the developer brought\nCompass\u2019 Rachel Glazer\non board to sell three units at the building, though she was dropped from the project in 2022.\nAt the time, Glazer\ndenied any \u201cdrama\u201d\nbetween her, Gold and the developers and instead told\nThe Real Deal\n, \u201cI don\u2019t think they need all these cooks in the kitchen at this point.\u201d\nHowever, between then and now, who exactly was in charge of deals at the building was murkier. Shlomi Reuveni of Reuveni Development Marketing took over some of the remaining listings last year, though teams with Douglas Elliman and BHHS each had one apartment under their purview, according to Streeteasy.\n\u201cI was adamant that, for me to take on the project, I would need a better idea of where the inventory remained,\u201d Rui said of the developer\u2019s decision to consolidate the unsold units with Nest Seekers. \u201cI had a clear narrative for buyers at 145 Central Park North. Storytelling is important, and I wanted to bring that same strategy to Circa.\u201d\nRui added that one of the main draws for the 38-unit building is its low monthly common charges due to a 25-year tax abatement under the state\u2019s 421a program, which won\u2019t expire until 2041. Its amenities include a 24-hour attended lobby, fitness center, parking and terrace.\nThe stepped building wrapped in glass was branded a \u201cdeath trap\u201d for birds in 2020, leading many of its residents to band together to try and\nprevent birds from colliding\nwith its windows.

        "content": "A few days after Assembly member Zohran \u201cRent Freeze\u201d Mamdani won the Democratic primary, which I called a\ncrushing defeat\nfor real estate, I wrote a column listing a few ways he could\nhelp the industry\n.\nAmong them were rezoning to add housing,\nweakening member deference\nin the City Council, supporting the\nCity Charter revisions\n, adding rental vouchers and making them\neasier to use\n, increasing staff to ease bottlenecks at the Department of Housing Preservation and Development and persuading Albany to reform property taxes.\nMamdani hasn\u2019t taken a position on charter reform, but he will probably have to soon because reporters will increasingly ask him about it as Election Day nears. But he has already endorsed the other five measures listed above.\nThe last of these, property taxes, is the most important.\nThe New York Apartment Association calculated that taxes this year will rise about $100 per apartment in rent-stabilized buildings because their tentative assessed values increased 2.75 percent.\nThat means tenants in these apartments will send almost $4,000 a year to the government, as the group\u2019s CEO, Kenny Burgos, said in a podcast. Of course, it\u2019s owners, not tenants, who pay the taxes, but the NYAA phrases it differently because it\u2019s the only hope of getting the state legislature to reduce multifamily tax rates.\nIt will take a lot more than that to move Albany, though. Property tax reform will never happen without a hard push from a popular mayor.\nThe time for mayors to ask for big changes from the state is immediately after taking office, when they have political capital from winning (aka a mandate).\nUnfortunately, Mamdani\u2019s promise on property taxes is to propose comprehensive changes by the end of his second year. That would mean no action by Albany until at least 2028.\nNot only is that a long time for bereft owners of rent-stabilized buildings to wait, but by then, who knows if Mamdani will have any political capital left? Two years is a lifetime in politics, as Eric Adams could tell you.\nBoth Adams and Bill de Blasio talked about the importance of property tax reform but made\nno real effort\nto achieve it because any change would involve raising taxes on someone.\nHowever, that shouldn\u2019t be an impediment to Mamdani, who has already called for higher taxes on the rich and said private homes in gentrified neighborhoods should be taxed more. Landlords generally agree.\nBurgos said on his\npodcast\nthat a $2,500-a-month apartment pays (indirectly) the same property taxes as a $1 million single-family home, and rental properties pay higher taxes than homes of the same size in the same neighborhood.\nBurgos and Mamdani, who were classmates at Bronx High School of Science and Democratic colleagues in the Assembly, have already met once since the primary. Discussions were held last week for the NYAA to meet with Mamdani advisers, which may yet happen.\n\n\u201cProperty tax reform is critical,\u201d Burgos said on the podcast. \u201cAt the very least, rent-stabilized buildings shouldn\u2019t be overtaxed while they are simultaneously being defunded by rent adjustments that don\u2019t keep up with inflation.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nOwners of buildings sometimes resist efforts to landmark them because it makes even the simplest of renovations more difficult and expensive. But now, under City of Yes, landmark status allows the owner to sell air rights to 10 times more sites than before, and the sale process takes only six to nine months instead of two or three years. Will any building owners seek landmark status in order to sell their air rights? Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The senior prosecutor investigating Trumped-up mortgage fraud allegations against New York Attorney General Letitia James has told colleagues she will advise her new boss, interim U.S. attorney Lindsey Halligan, to drop the matter \u2014 against the president\u2019s wishes \u2014 because there is no probable cause to file charges, MSNBC\nreported\n. Halligan\u2019s predecessor, a Trump nominee, resigned rather than bring the case. My\nSept. 23 column\nexplains why the case is so weak.\nElsewhere\u2026\nIf the bill passed by the City Council requiring gas appliances to be\ninstalled by a master plumber\nbecomes law, will landlords simply buy electric stoves instead? That\u2019s not an option in many older buildings, one landlord told me.\n\u201cThe wiring in the majority of rent-stabilized apartments would not support [electric stoves],\u201d he said. \u201cAnd basically not in all pre-war rent-stabilized.\u201d\nAfter upgrading stoves in a certain number of apartments, the owner ends up having to upgrade the entire building\u2019s incoming service and risers \u201cbecause the old wiring would not support the increased load without dramatically increasing the risk of electrical fires.\u201d\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$15.5 million\nfor two adjacent houses at 809-815 Avenue J in Midwood. The lots total 8,000 square feet.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$92 million\nfor the Hilton Garden Inn at 30 West 46th Street in Times Square. The hotel is 21 stories and has 196 rooms.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $25 million for a 9,308-square-foot townhouse at 7 East 80th Street on the Upper East Side. Serena Boardman of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty has\nthe listing\n.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "Do you remember this New York Times\nheadline\nfrom February 2024?\nThey\u2019re Starting a New York \u2018Housing League.\u2019 NIMBYs Not Allowed.\nVirtually nothing has been heard from the\nhousing league\nsince. But that\u2019s by design, a co-founder told me.\nI took the opportunity to ask Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso about the group when I was interviewing him about his\nseemingly rogue\nPlanning Commission appointee.\nI assumed nothing had come of the housing league, because I had seen no mention of it in the media, press releases or anywhere else since it first convened at Brooklyn Borough Hall.\nBut that is not the case, Reynoso told me. He said the group tries to meet every month. More than 10 elected officials regularly attend, and others come occasionally.\n\u201cYou must be serving good food,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no food,\u201d Reynoso replied.\n\nThe purpose of the gatherings is to talk about how to support a pro-housing agenda. However, elected officials are welcome to attend even if they are not in the YIMBY camp. \u201cWe want to have a big tent,\u201d Reynoso said.\nHe and Manhattan City Council member Erik Bottcher invited 160 elected officials to the first get-together. One reason the league has not been heard from since is that it takes no official positions. It\u2019s not even a formal organization. But it does do things, according to Reynoso.\nFor example, the housing league pushed for elected officials to sign on to an\namicus brief\nsupporting the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity against a\nlegal challenge\n. At least 29 elected officials, including Assembly member Zohran Mamdani, have done so.\nThe league also encouraged its members (although technically, there is no formal membership) to support Council member Shahana Hanif\u2019s negotiated rezoning for the\nArrow Linen project\nin Windsor Terrace.\nA\nvocal NIMBY group\nhad formed to demand the project\u2019s height be reduced by half, and\nvowed to unelect Hanif\nif she refused. The opposition group\nfailed miserably\n. Hanif only trimmed the height of the project. She kept its unit count intact and instead insisted on deeper affordability. Then she\nwon re-election handily\nagainst a well-funded opponent.\nIt was also a win for progressives and supporters of the abundance strategy to alleviate the housing shortage.\n(Disclaimer: It remains to be seen if the Arrow Linen project will pencil out under the state\u2019s 485x tax abatement. A project is not truly a project until it gets a construction loan. If developer Andrew Esposito doesn\u2019t get financing, it would likely be because Hanif demanded too many low-rent units.)\nReynoso said the housing league would also back elected officials who support future housing development at the Pacific Park (formerly Atlantic Yards) site, as well as other projects \u201cthat might on occasion face local backlash or political backlash.\u201d\n",

The property appears to be one residence that spans 4,500 square feet across two tax lots. The buyer was an LLC tied to\nJoseph E. Khezrie\n, of the family that founded the Jimmy Jazz stores. He is also director of investments at Jersey City, New Jersey-based CityView Commercial.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded in the Big Apple was on the Upper West Side, where two commercial condos sold for a total of $14.4 million.

The buyer was\nJaan Holdings LLC\n. The Fazios had owned the unit since 2016, when they purchased it for $4.9 million. It went on the market in July for $6.2 million. The unit has exposed brick walls, wood-beamed ceilings and a chef\u2019s kitchen.

The property features two storefronts leased to shoemaker Birkenstock and luggage shop Rimowa.\nThe deal breaks down to nearly $3,800 a square foot for the two-story building that spans 7,106 square feet. It was completed in 2014. The property sold for $5.5 million above the previous sale price nine years ago.\nThe seller, an affiliate of Norfolk, Virginia-based Harbor Group International, led by president T. Richard Litton, Jr., paid $21.5 million for the building in 2016, records show.\n\nIn January, River Oaks paid\n$28 million\nfor a two-story commercial building in Miami Beach\u2019s South of Fifth neighborhood. The firm bought the property, leased to seafood restaurant Catch, from Miami-based retail and hospitality real estate investor Robert Rivani.\nPrimarily focused on acquiring retail properties in its home city in Texas, River Oaks dipped into the South Florida market in 2022. The firm acquired Shop Delray, a grocery-anchored shopping center in Delray Beach, for\n$25.5 million\n. Founded in 1959, River Oaks has a portfolio of more than 190 shopping centers and single-tenant retail properties, the firm\u2019s website states.\nThe Miami Design District is arguably South Florida\u2019s hottest retail submarket. Last month, Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega\u2019s family office, Ponte Gadea, picked up Atlas Plaza at 130 Northeast 40th Street for roughly\n$110 million\n. The property\u2019s tenants include a Rolex store and Michael\u2019s Genuine, one of the district\u2019s longest running restaurants.\nIn July, Beverly Hills-based jeweler Ildico bought a two-story retail building at 3800 Northeast Second Avenue for\n$35 million\n. The fully leased property\u2019s tenant roster includes hardwood flooring company Listone Giordano and luxury clothing retailers L\u2019Atelier Paris Haute Design and CNCPTS Miami.",

Blair Chang and LeAnne Thrasher hold the listing.\nMuskoka Living makes and sells furniture and also provides design services. Started in 1998, the company has showrooms in Gardena, Calif. where it also has its manufacturing facility, and in Muskoka, Canada.\nThe DeFranciscos snapped up the property in 2020 for $7.4 million, according to records. They then went to work rebuilding and redesigning the home, which was completed in 2022.\nBrentwood is part of the city of Los Angeles, making the deal subject to the Measure United to House L.A. (Measure ULA)\u00a0 two-tiered tax. If it sells above $10.6 million, as likely in this instance,\u00a0 the higher tax bracket of 5.5 percent will apply.\n\nThe seven-bed, seven-bath home spans 9,000 square feet. Most of the home\u2019s furniture, cabinetry and flooring was created by Muskoka Living. Each bedroom has its own private terrace, while olive and citrus trees dot the backyard. There\u2019s also a pool, spa, detached guest house and sports court.\nLast week\u2019s second-priciest\u00a0 home to go into contract was 620 North Bedford Drive in the Beverly Hills Flats neighborhood, with a list price of nearly $22 million, or just under $2,000 per square foot.\nThat comes on the heels of the closing off market of\n722 North Maple Drive\n, which sold for $22.4 million, or $2,571 per square foot, over the weekend. The Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Jack Harris and Michael Fahimian represented a local family in its purchase of the property, while Keller Williams\u2019 Gary Gold was the listing agent.\nThe Bedford Drive home counts seven beds and nine baths across 11,000 square feet. Highlights of the contemporary-designed residence include a motor court, glass-enclosed wine storage, theater, wellness suite and sauna, basketball court and pool.\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\u2019s Aaron Kirman and Jordana Leigh have the listing.\nProperty records indicate the seller is a trust tied to Jessee and Rebecca Sarshar.\nOverall, Los Angeles County signed contracts last week tallied up to $227.5 million in listing price volume across 23 properties, according to the Eklund Gomes report. That comes to around $9.9 million per deal, with$2,035 per square foot on average for the bunch.\nCompared to the year-ago period, signed contracts last week were off by four deals and up 9.4 percent in asking volume.\n",

        "content": "When Emelia Arencibia moved to Brickell Key in 2016, she thought that her one-bedroom condo would mark her final home. Then, she had to cover her share of a large assessment to pay for upgrades and repairs to her building after the deadly\nSurfside condo collapse\nin 2021.\nArencibia\u2019s share of the assessment at Brickell Key Two in Miami was about $47,000, and she was able to secure a zero-interest loan for which she will have to start making payments next year.\nThe financing, she said, \u201csaved my life, and saves a lot of people\u2019s lives on this island.\u201d\nThe 75-year-old is among many owners on fixed incomes on\nBrickell Key\nwho now have to worry about paying for the next big project: a multimillion-dollar replacement of the seawall that surrounds the man-made island. The Brickell Key Master Association, of which Swire Properties has a controlling vote, is spearheading the project.\nBrickell Key, formerly called Claughton Island, was developed beginning in 1982 with the completion of Brickell Key One. The island consists of 11 condo buildings, ground-floor retail space, and the Courvoisier Centre office buildings. Swire first bought a stake in the island in the late 1970s.\nAn estimate that the master association included in a Sept. 10 presentation pegs the total cost of the seawall replacement at $33.6 million, with construction potentially starting in 2026.\nUnit owners at Brickell Key\u2019s nearly 3,000 condos could pay via a lump sum, quarterly for 3.5 years, or with a seven-year loan, according to the presentation.\nThe cost per unit will depend on which payment option owners select, from about $6 per square foot to more than $8 per square foot. That ranges in total from a $3,581 lump sum for a 600-square-foot unit to $5,565 for the same sized unit. Larger condos of 2,500 square feet would pay $14,921 (lump sum) to $20,319 if financed.\nSome unit owners allege that\nSwire\nProperties\u2019 U.S. arm, led by President Henry Bott, is pushing the project through now because it also plans to replace the seawall where the\nMandarin Residences\nluxury condo development will be built. Swire controls the master association even though it only controls that site.\nThe Mandarin project surpassed $1 billion in presales earlier this year. Remaining units start at about $5 million.\nSwire has an application pending with the city of Miami to demolish the existing Mandarin hotel at 500 Brickell Key Drive via implosion, likely next year. It plans to then build the two-tower, 228-unit luxury condo and hotel project with additional hotel rooms and condo-hotel units.\nOwners from six condo associations \u2014 Brickell Key One, Brickell Key Two, Isola, the St. Louis, Corvoisier Courts and Carbonell \u2014 hired an attorney to engage with the master association and Swire regarding the seawall replacement and planned renovation of the baywalk. In a letter sent to Brickell Key condo owners in September, attorney Carl Goldfarb wrote that Swire and the master association have ignored the condo associations\u2019 requests to meet face to face to discuss the seawall and baywalk projects.\n\u201cThis work conveniently coincides with the timing of Swire\u2019s plans for development of the Residences at the Mandarin Oriental, even though the August 6, 2024 seawall inspection report commissioned by the BKMA concluded, \u2018No immediate structural repairs are required at this time,\u2019\u201d the letter from Goldfarb states.\nThe August 2024 seawall inspection report states that \u201cno significant settlement of the seawall structure was observed during the inspection,\u201d and that significant seawall deterioration was not noted compared to 2023. \u201cHowever, in comparison with prior years, dating back to the first such inspection in 2014, the progression of deterioration is noted, outside of the 2018 repair project,\u201d the letter states.\nA spokesperson for Swire said the company has been transparent with Brickell Key residents, and hosted more than 10 town hall meetings with residents in recent months.\nThe seawall is required to be maintained to provide protection against a 100-year flood. An annual inspection is also required, records show.\n\nSome owners on Brickell Key and across the waterway off of\nBrickell\nAvenue are also concerned that the proposed implosion of the Mandarin hotel and the construction of the new towers will impact the existing seawall, which was built in 1973. A geotechnical report completed in early 2024 states that \u201cconstruction-related vibrations could impact the seawall as well.\u201d But the damage caused to adjacent structures are \u201ctypically cosmetic in nature\u201d the report states.\nSwire plans to pay for roughly 20 percent of the estimated $33.6 million cost of the seawall project, according to a presentation made by BKMA\u2019s General Manager Anna Brautigam in April, which sources confirmed. That represents the 1,300-linear-foot portion of the seawall that fronts the Mandarin Residences project site. BKMA would be responsible for the remaining 4,600 linear feet.\nHowever, the Brickell Key Master Association\u2019s governing documents would require only a 1.8 percent contribution from Swire. The association was formed in 1982. Swire\u2019s voting majority still exists because the company still owns land on the island. Until it completes the Mandarin Residences project, sells the units and turns control over to the unit owners, it will retain the same amount of control as it currently has.\nSwire\u2019s planned contribution \u201cexceeds its pro-rata share according to the governing documents,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nUnit owners\u2019 contributions will be calculated based on their interior square footage and 50 percent of their balcony space. BKMA plans to begin collecting payments sometime during the first quarter of next year, Brautigam said during the April presentation. BKMA will offer unit owners financing and has term sheets from Banco Popular and BankUnited.\nConfusion and disputes over responsibility for payment have spread to other issues.\nA decade ago, the Miami City Commission voted to amend the 1975 development order for Brickell Key. The amendment requires Swire to \u201cdedicate, develop, and perpetually maintain 2.5-acre linear waterfront park and an additional 0.25 acre public park on Brickell Key, design and location to be determined by Swire,\u201d according to the 2015 approval.\u00a0The amendment increased the number of residential units and decreased the commercial space that could be built on the island.\nTodd Worthe, who owns a three-bedroom condo at Carbonell on Brickell Key, believes that Swire should reimburse unit owners for the cost of maintenance and security for the park over the past 10 years.\n\u201cSwire agreed to maintain the public park in perpetuity,\u201d Worthe said. \u201cIt\u2019s been the residents, not Swire, who have been assessed and paying for the maintenance and security. And it\u2019s open to the public. If we\u2019re going to pay for it, shouldn\u2019t it be privatized?\u201d\nThe Swire spokesperson said the 1975 development order and the 2015 amendment \u201cdo not impose any obligations of operating expenses to Swire Properties.\u201d\nFor the seawall project, two buildings, St. Louis and Isola, may be in a different situation than the other buildings. St. Louis and Isola control their seawalls, but they are subject to BKMA\u2019s seawall covenant, Brautigam said in a letter.\n\u201cChoosing to replace their seawalls separately could present several challenges for these associations, and we believe both buildings stand to benefit greatly from being part of the larger project,\u201d she wrote.\nArencibia said she\u2019s spoken to neighbors who believe they had to pay their shares by Oct. 1. Others haven\u2019t yet received estimates of their share of the seawall project.\nThe years of construction and additional cost could force Arencibia to sell her condo, where she expected to live the rest of her years.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, I cannot pay the amount or ask for another loan,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel very insecure about it.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A Midtown office building that\nfailed to find any bidders at auction\nlast year has traded in a landmark sale for its newly rezoned neighborhood.\nMarty Burger and Andrew Heiberger paid $25 million for the 85,000-square-foot building at 29 West 35th Street with plans to convert it into 107 studio apartments, the developers announced on Wednesday. The deal was backed by financing from Allegiant and 400CM, with David Levinson of L&amp;L and Terracotta Management joining as equity partners.\nThe project is among the first office-to-residential conversions in the\nrezoned corridor\nin Midtown South, which the City Council approved in August. The rezoning, dubbed the Midtown South Mixed-Use Plan, spans 42 blocks and is expected to yield more than 9,500 housing units.\n\u201cWe leaned on the fact that it was in the Midtown South rezoning area,\u201d said Colliers\u2019 Zach Redding, whose team represented the special servicer. \u201cWhen we signed the contract, it hadn\u2019t passed yet, but all signs were pointing toward it working out.\u201d\nRedding was joined by other members of the firm\u2019s New York Capital Markets Group, including Dylan Kane and Matt Mastrocola. Ben Schlegel of Ariel Property Advisors represented the developers in the financing deal.\n\nBarry Sternlicht\u2019s LNR took the office building from its owners last September after an auction for the property\nfailed to attract\nany bidders. The bidding threshold was set at $23 million, which would work out to roughly $270 per square foot \u2014 a price lower than the $30 million Paul Sohayegh and Roni Movahedian paid for it in 2007 and significantly below the $80 million they sought for it in 2017.\nLNR\nfiled to foreclose\non the property in 2022 after Sohayegh and Movahedian defaulted on a $41 million loan. At the time, a referee appointed by a judge in the case estimated that the landlords owed their lender more than $50 million.\nThe joint venture between Burger\u2019s firm, Infinite Global Real Estate Partners, and Burger\u2019s Buttonwood Development will lean on the 467m tax abatement for the project, which will include 27 affordable apartments priced at around $1,700 a month.\nThe apartments will range from 475 to 500 square feet with ceiling heights between 11 and 14 feet. Most of the units will include \u201cflexible spaces such as home offices, alcoves or bonus rooms,\u201d according to the press release.\nPlanned amenities at the building, the conversion of which will be designed by Ismael Leyva Architects, include doormen, a pet washing station and rooftop outfitted with game tables and an outdoor movie screen.\n",

Scott Rechler worked quickly to recapitalize the prominent office building.\nNow, RXR has secured a $1.45 billion recapitalization for the property, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The deal includes a three-year extension on a $1 billion debt originated by Apollo Global Management, which will see the maturity date\nextended\nto June 2028.\nThe recapitalization also includes a fresh injection of equity from a plethora of investors RXR is already familiar with, such as the Baupost Group, King Street Capital Management, Criterion Real Estate Capital, Abrams Capital and Liberty Mutual. The equity is expected to range from $250 million to $400 million.\nAs part of the recapitalization, Fox News is expected to receive $130 million in tenant improvements.

        "content": "Warning signs that Trinity Flood\u2019s Chicago real estate portfolio could land in trouble quickly piled up after the little-known Wisconsin-based investor bought a trio of apartment complexes in 2020.\nAlthough it may not have been obvious five years ago that one of Flood\u2019s South Side buildings would become the site of a\nmassive federal immigration raid\nand the subject of national controversy, the property\u2019s chaotic backstory illustrates how a transaction gone wrong can devolve into a precarious situation for an entire neighborhood.\nVarious legal filings reveal that opportunities to address disarray at the property came and went without action from the landlord or Cook County\u2019s court system.\nThe consequences of that inaction culminated last week when residents woke up in the middle of the night to hundreds of federal agents descending on the building from trucks and helicopters. They arrested dozens and reportedly detained many more tenants, including children, during the operation.\nIn the aftermath of the raid, local and state officials criticized the tactics and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker called on state agencies to investigate if federal agents used excessive force against minors.\nThe first signal of trouble at the property came from Flood over five years ago, shortly after she purchased the building and two others nearby for $18 million total.\nBuyer\u2019s remorse\nA few months after buying the apartments in 2020 as part of a 1031 exchange, Flood filed a lawsuit against the seller and brokers involved in the purchase.\nSuch 1031 deals allow investors to defer taxes on the sale of real estate if they reinvest the proceeds into a new property transaction within certain timelines. So Flood had to move fast.\nShe purchased the South Shore Drive building as a part of a portfolio that also included 6916 South Clyde Avenue and 7038 South Chappel Avenue.\nA few months after buying the properties, Flood accused seller\nDaniel Hedaya of DAX Real Estate\nand his brokers,\nAaron Sklar and Noah Birk\nof Chicago-based Kiser Group, of improperly inflating the property values.\nFlood called out the conditions of the South Shore Drive property, where the unsettling raid would later take place, including the need for around-the-clock, on-site security that cost $15,000 monthly. She claimed the prior owner didn\u2019t make her aware of the security requirements, and its brokers prevented her from touring more than two of the 130 units in the complex because the building was almost entirely occupied.\nFlood pointed out the portfolio had last sold for $11 million in 2017 prior to DAX\u2019s renovations. She alleged the brokers told her the jump in value was due to the improvements and increase in occupancy at the buildings. Hedaya told\nThe Real Deal\nin 2019 that his firm spent \u201cseveral million dollars\u201d on the projects.\nBut at 7500 South Shore, Flood claimed she had been told that all units in the building were renovated when in reality, 21 had been left untouched. She further alleged that the scope of the renovations throughout the building had been exaggerated or misstated.\nThe parties reached a confidential settlement in October 2023, but by then Flood was racking up significant city code violations on at least two of her three Chicago buildings. Kiser Group\u2019s Sklar declined to comment and Birk didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\nCity\u2019s suspicions\nIn August 2021, about a year-and-a-half after Flood purchased the portfolio, a fire broke out at the 6916 Clyde Avenue building, injuring four tenants and a firefighter. As the city began monitoring the building for code violations, it was also tracking similar problems at 7500 South Shore.\nSince 2021, the buildings have racked up dozens of code violations, most of which are associated with the South Shore Drive building.\nWhile conditions continued to deteriorate, Flood\nattempted to sell the portfolio last year\nbut never closed a deal.\n\nIssues documented as recently as this summer at the South Shore Drive property include \u201cinoperable elevators, flooding, stench of urine in the stairways, and armed occupants along with alleged criminal activity and shootings at the property,\u201d an email from the city legal department stated.\nThe email, which was sent in August, went on to note that the city hadn\u2019t conducted a full interior inspection of the property due to security concerns and a shooting that took place on June 23 during an inspection.\nWhen Flood failed to resolve the issues, Chicago officials requested in August that Cook County Circuit Court Judge Leonard Murray appoint a limited receiver for the building to help kickstart work on the property. The request is still pending in court.\nGetting a receiver appointed to a building can be a lengthy process, even in cases where a building is in dire condition, said Eric Janssen, a receiver and founder of Chicago Real Estate Resources.\n\u201cSometimes it takes a while for both sides to go back and forth and for a receiver to be ultimately appointed,\u201d Janssen said. \u201cAnd each judge is different.\u201d\nIn the meantime, the portfolio began to run into financial trouble, as well.\nLender closes in\nAs the code violations accumulated,\nFlood was hit with a $27 million foreclosure lawsuit\nin April 2025, alleging she was behind on loan payments and had failed to insure the South Shore Drive building.\nIn addition to the South Side portfolio that Flood bought for $18 million, the investor also purchased three properties in Georgia and one in Arizona with a $25.3 million loan. The loans against all six properties were later packaged up with other real estate debt and sold off to commercial mortgage-backed securities investors. Now, Flood is in danger of losing all 354 units across the nation, including the 208 in Chicago\u2019s South Shore neighborhood.\nRather than forfeit the struggling properties via foreclosure, Flood fought back, seeking to retain her control.\nAmid the legal-back-and-forth, Wells Fargo, which was representing the trustees of the debt package, repeatedly requested that a judge appoint a receiver to the South Shore Drive property. Flood successfully delayed such an appointment multiple times.\nThe debate was raging just days before the raid.\nA recent legal filing from Wells Fargo stated that the lender first requested the appointment of a receiver in May. After Flood\u2019s resistance, Wells Fargo went on to state that \u201cnow, four months later, the condition of the South Shore Property is worse than before and the appointment of a receiver has become urgent.\u201d\nWells Fargo filed an emergency motion on September 22 requesting, once again, that Cook County Circuit Court Judge Debra Seaton appoint a receiver.\nFlood hit back, stating that an ongoing dispute over a lender-placed insurance plan needed to be resolved first.\nEight days later, federal agents stormed the building, ultimately arresting 37 people who were \u201cbelieved to be involved in drug trafficking and distribution, weapons crimes, and immigration violators,\u201d according to a statement from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Further information on the severity of the alleged crimes has been limited so far.\nIllinois and Chicago officials have also alleged the agents infringed on the rights of other tenants in the building who were detained outside and who may have suffered from lost or damaged property.\nIt\u2019s unclear how the property got onto the federal government\u2019s radar but Chicago officials said they didn\u2019t know about the raid ahead of time or collaborate with federal law enforcement agencies on the operation.\nThe day after the raid, Seaton agreed to appoint a receiver to the property at an Oct. 17 court hearing. She hasn\u2019t yet determined who the receiver will be despite Wells Fargo putting forth several specific options throughout the legal process.\n",

        "content": "Landlord and tenants\u2019 rights have been thrust into debate as tensions flare between local and federal authorities over the handling of immigration enforcement in Chicago.\nLegal recourse is another matter, and landlords have little in that vein as\nuncertainty swirls around how\nthey can respond to intensifying federal policing across the city.\n\u201cThe bottom line is, there is not much a landlord can do as it relates to police conduct within their building, whether in a common area or a tenant\u2019s apartment,\u201d said Monu Bedi, a DePaul University College of Law Professor who specializes in criminal procedure and military law. \u201cIf there is damage to the building, landlords are able to recover money for the property but that is different than their rights to prevent officers from entering.\u201d\nLocal and state officials are calling into question the tactics used last week by hundreds of federal agents to raid\na 130-unit South Shore apartment complex\nat 7500 South South Shore Drive, and whether they violated typical criminal procedure while arresting dozens and reportedly detaining many more tenants, including children, temporarily during the operation.\nIllinois Governor J.B. Pritzker on Monday called on the state Department of Child and Family Services and the Department of Human Services to investigate if federal agents used excessive force against minors.\nMeanwhile, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul is seeking an emergency order to block President Donald Trump\u2019s request to activate the National Guard in Chicago. The Oct. 6 filing refers to the South Shore raid as an example of federal authorities\u2019 already extensive presence in Chicago and possible overreach of immigration officers\u2019 duties.\n\u201cWhile it is not clear whether any part of that conduct was within any lawful federal authority, [federal officials] were not impeded in executing this large-scale planned operation,\u201d the filing reads.\nA judge declined to grant Raoul\u2019s request on an immediate basis but set a hearing on the matter for Thursday, even as President Donald Trump hinted Tuesday he could invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy military troops to various cities, should a court order blocking such action arise.\nAlong with Raoul\u2019s litigation, several law enforcement officials and business leaders filed declarations supporting the attorney\u2019s general\u2019s request. Among them was the former commissioner of Customs and Border Patrol, R. Gil Kerlikowske, and prominent business lobbyists whose groups touch on real estate matters, such as Jack Lavin, president of the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, and Sam Toia, president of the Illinois Restaurant Association.\nAlso on Monday, Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order aimed at prohibiting\nICE activity\non city-owned properties.\nAnd on Tuesday, a U.S. District Judge in Chicago ruled that federal immigration agents illegally arrested 26 people without warrants back in January, violating a 2023 consent decree that dictates how such arrests can be carried out.\nAt least one Chicago landlord has faced public pressure to push back against ICE. Organizers on the Southwest Side on Tuesday called on Michigan-based Friedman Real Estate to block ICE from using one of its parking lots at The Yards Plaza as a staging area for agents, Block Club Chicago reported. Friedman hasn\u2019t made any public response as of yet, and didn\u2019t return the outlet\u2019s request for comment.\n\nGroups like the National Apartment Association have\nput together guidance\non how to respond to ICE actions like subpoenas and raids. Key points include:\nProperty managers are not required to allow ICE agents to enter a building unless they have a criminal warrant signed by a judge.\nProperty owners can consult with an attorney before responding to a subpoena for information about tenants.\nThere\u2019s little precedent, however, for the way ICE has been operating in Chicago, said Hugh Mundy, a law professor at The University of Illinois at Chicago who specializes in criminal procedure.\n\u201cThis [South Shore] raid was really unlike anything that I have witnessed, either as a lawyer or as a law professor,\u201d he said. He added that a warrant typically targets specific units rather than an entire building.\nThe operation resulted in 37 arrests. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security identified two people arrested as alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren De Aragua, and an unspecified number of suspects were \u201cbelieved to be involved in drug trafficking and distribution and weapons crimes,\u201d according to the agency. Other arrests were due to immigration violations.\nMundy said the scale of the raid \u2014 which involved multiple agencies and officers arriving in helicopters and trucks in the middle of the night \u2014 seemed more fitting for a racketeering investigation.\n\u201cYou would normally expect that kind of force to result in more arrests for more serious crimes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019d have to be some general collective knowledge or a common goal and crimes that relate to that goal.\u201d\nStill, city officials, the property owner, lender and more real estate professionals were informed of problems the building was facing well before the raid took place.\nChicago code inspectors visited the property just two weeks before it was subject to the massive operation, according to a legal filing in a\n$27 million foreclosure lawsuit\nagainst the building\u2019s owner, Wisconsin-based investor Trinity Flood. The building was found to be unsecured, leading to increased criminal activity and shootings, and its property manager lost control of the situation as conditions worsened, according to legal filings.\nA spokesperson for the mayor\u2019s office said the city was unaware the raid would take place ahead of time and that the city didn\u2019t collaborate with federal immigration officials to conduct the operation.",

The expansion will bring Uniqlo\u2019s U.S. footprint to nearly 90 stores, up from 78, and marks a notable re-entry into corridors where high retail rents and shifting consumer habits have thinned tenant rosters in recent years.\nThe flagships at 600 North Michigan Avenue in Chicago and 801 Market Street in San Francisco will be the only ones outside New York City, Uniqlo said.

Ponte Gadea did not record a mortgage, signifying this was likely a cash deal.\nChris Lee and Sean Kelly of CBRE represented the sellers.\nThe 524,000-square-foot Sabadell Financial Center was completed in 2000 on a 1.8-acre lot, as part of a larger mixed-use project that included the adjacent 296-key JW Marriott Miami. Kendall-based MDM Group and Brickell-based Rilea Group were the developers.\nTenants include co-working firm Industrious, marketing firm Tibint, Kennedys Law, Law Offices of Wolf &amp; Pravato and commercial real estate services firm\nNorthmarq\n.\nKKR and Parkway had paid\n$248.5 million\nfor the building in 2018, according to records.\nKKR is led by co-CEOs Joseph Bae and Scott Nuttall, and Parkway is led by James Heistand, their respective websites show.\n\nThe deal comes amid slower South Florida office investment sales compared with the deal flurry during the pandemic. At that time, lower interest rates and an influx of out-of-state companies leasing big blocks of space prompted record rent growth and a sales spree. Over the past two years, elevated interest rates and some skittishness among lenders curbed the investment bonanza.\nIn Miami-Dade County, office deal volume reached $2.1 billion in 2021 and $1.1 billion in 2022, according to data provided by CBRE. Although volume dropped to $700 million in 2023, sales picked up last year to $1.4 billion. During the first half of the year and a portion of the third quarter, Miami-Dade sales totaled $293 million, the data shows.\nOrtega\u2019s Sabadell purchase surpasses the previous top South Florida office sales this year. In February, Bradford Allen Investment Advisors paid\n$208 million\nfor Las Olas Centre I &amp; II at 350 and 450 East Las Olas Boulevard in downtown Fort Lauderdale. Also in February, Lone Star Funds\u2019 fund VII, Highline Real Estate Capital and Square2 Capital bought the Bank of America Plaza at Las Olas City Centre at 401 East Las Olas Boulevard in downtown Fort Lauderdale for\n$221 million\n.\nMany of the players still purchasing offices are all-cash buyers that can avoid expensive financing. Ortega, best known as the founder of Zara and the Inditex clothing stores holding firm, is a cash buyer, reinvesting earnings from his retail empire into real estate globally through Ponte Gadea.\nOrtega\n, who Forbes ranks as the 12th richest person globally with a net worth of $127.1 billion, has been especially active this year. This coincides with an expected record $3.6 billion in dividends this year from his retail holdings, with the billionaire possibly deploying cash into properties to shield his earnings from Spain\u2019s hefty wealth tax,\nBloomberg reported\n.\nPurchasing all cash also allows for a reprieve on prices because sellers are more interested in the certainty of closing over getting the highest price in the current financing climate, an expert told\nThe Real Deal\nin July.\nLast month, Ponte Gadea paid\n$110 million\nfor the fully leased Atlas Plaza retail building at 130 Northeast 40th Street in the Miami Design District. In June, it bought the 259-unit Veneto Las Olas apartment tower at 201 South Federal Highway in downtown Fort Lauderdale for\n$165 million\n.\nIn Paris, Ponte Gadea bought the five-star 90-key Hotel Banke for\n$113 million\nin July, and the eight-story office and retail property at 223 Rue Saint-Honor\u00e9 from Hines for about 170 million euros (about $197.3 million) last month. In May, it paid\n$284 million\nfor a 290,000-square-foot office building in Barcelona that\u2019s home to Spanish book publisher Planeta\u2019s headquarters. Ponte Gadea also reportedly is buying a 49 percent stake in Brookfield Asset Management\u2019s PD Ports in the United Kingdom for an undisclosed amount.",

That price is 58 percent less than the $31 million that former owners Barker Pacific Group paid for the building in 2020.

        "content": "Downtown Dallas could soon lose both of its big league sports draws.\nAfter more than two decades at the American Airlines Center, the Dallas Stars are exploring a move to Plano, joining the Mavericks in considering new homes once their leases expire in 2031. The Stars\u2019 ownership advisory group met last week and identified Plano as a leading contender for a future arena site, the Dallas Business Journal and Front Office Sports\nreported\n.\nArlington is also in the mix. The concept under review would mirror sports-anchored entertainment districts like The Battery in Atlanta or\nTexas Live!\nin Arlington \u2014 sprawling mixed-use campuses designed to keep fans eating, shopping and spending long after the final buzzer.\nThe NHL franchise, owned by Canadian hotel and restaurant developer Tom Gagliardi, has deep roots in Collin County. The team already runs youth programs in Plano and operates its practice and front-office hub out of the Comerica Center in Frisco. Team president and CEO Brad Alberts confirmed talks with Plano officials but said no decision has been made.\nThe site search marks a notable shift for Alberts, who just two years ago publicly backed staying at the AAC, calling it \u201ca great place to play for a long time.\u201d Built in 2001, the 20,000-seat arena is a centerpiece of the\nVictory Park\ndistrict and a key contributor to downtown\u2019s economy.\n\nThe Stars and\nMavericks\nhave brought billions in economic impact to the area since moving in, according to the city.\nBut 2031 looms as a turning point. The\nMavericks\n, owned by Las Vegas Sands owners Miriam Adelson and Patrick Dumont, have already said they plan to build a new arena before their lease expires, with one option reportedly being the site of Dallas City Hall \u2014 a downtown parcel the city may sell or redevelop, the Dallas Morning News first reported.\nIf both franchises leave, it would represent a seismic shift for downtown\u2019s entertainment ecosystem. The departures would follow other corporate moves under consideration, including AT&amp;T\u2019s potential exit, threatening to sap economic energy from the city\u2019s core while further supercharging growth in the suburbs.\nThe Stars say they\u2019re \u201cevaluating all options,\u201d but if the Collin County trend holds, the next great Dallas sports district could be miles from downtown.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The purchasing entity ties to Glen Allen, Virginia-based Capital Square, an intermediary likely doing a 1031 exchange on behalf of the true buyer, Vizzda records show. The true buyer remains unknown.\nThe buyer borrowed a $12 million Fannie Mae loan for the purchase. The deal breaks down to $370,000 per unit.\nCompleted in 2021, Villages at Miami Gardens consists of seven two-story apartment buildings on a 3-acre lot. It offers three- and four-bedroom units, with monthly rents ranging from $3,150 to $3,550.\nThe selling entity had paid $900,000 for the development site in 2017, according to property records.\nSouth Florida multifamily investment sales have picked up in recent months.\n\nThe tri-county region became a magnet for out-of-state residents during the pandemic, which prompted unprecedented apartment demand, record rent growth and a deal flurry.\nOver the past two years, the market slowed amid higher interest rates and some skittish lenders. Also, demand eased,\nlease-ups slowed\nand rents declined because developers completed a record number of units last year as the influx of newcomers slowed.\nThe recent pickup coincides with the impending year-end, when investors rush to close purchases or sell properties to get them off their balance sheets.\nThis month, Morgan Properties paid nearly\n$70 million\nfor the 300-unit Visions at Willow Pond at\u00a0 4860 Sand Stone Lane in unincorporated Palm Beach County. Also, Tishman Speyer bought the 270-unit Bell at Broken Sound Apartments at 5500 Broken Sound Boulevard Northwest and 950 Northwest Broken Sound Parkway in Boca Raton for\n$124.5 million\n.\nLast month, AEW Capital Management and Mast Capital sold the 342-unit Remi on the River apartment complex at 999 Northwest Seventh Street in Miami to Valeris Capital for\n$108.4 million\n.\nLegacy Residential Group paid\n$77 million\n, also last month, for the 416-unit Legacy at Coconut Creek complex at 4303 West Atlantic Boulevard in Coconut Creek.\n",

The north tower, currently open for sales, has between 60-70 units available. Once that nears sell-out status, the south side will open for sales, according to Go.\nUnits are priced from roughly $2.5 million to over $20 million. On a per-square-foot basis, that\u2019s around $1,700 to $3,000.\nThe $2.5 billion, six-acre Century Plaza consists of the residential towers in addition to the recently renovated 400-room Fairmont Century Plaza hotel. The hotel property includes 63 branded residences and 100,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space.\nThe\nReuben Brothers\n\u2019 snapped up the property through a $1 billion foreclosure in 2023 from the project\u2019s original developer, Michael Rosenfeld. The purchase price was roughly half what it cost to build the property out.\n\u201cThe Reuben Brothers have really spearheaded a very significant investment in both time, money and enthusiasm into this project,\u201d Go said. \u201cThis is something they\u2019re all personally involved in.\u201d\n\nSo far, the four-person Go Group has clocked roughly 40 showings and the buyers trickling through are diverse. Some have come from Northern California, out of state or outside the country to seek secondary homes. One of the first deals the group struck was with an international buyer who will use their residence a few months of the year, according to Go. Other buyers are interested in the safety of a guard-gated property, concierge and direct-to-unit access, she said.\nThe various amenities have helped draw interest in Century City, which has seen its traditional base of high-rise, Class A office thrive while other parts of the market, including downtown L.A., struggle.\nLaw firms Skadden, Arps, Meagher &amp; Flom and commercial real estate brokerage\nSavills are among the firms that have left downtown Los Angeles in favor of Century City.\nMichelin-star restaurant Sushi Noz from New York has already begun a buildout on a Century Plaza location. Among other businesses set to open next summer are Asian-inspired restaurant KYU and a new concept from\nWally\u2019s Wine &amp; Spirits\n, which is backed by Guess Inc. co-founders Paul and Maurice Marciano. Also incoming are Milos and Le Specialit\u00e0.\nThe Estate\n, a health and wellness concept created by Tony Robbins\u2019 Fountain Life and Sam Nazarian\u2019s SBE, will occupy about\n13,000 square feet\nat the project.\nOne crosswalk over, residents also have access to Westfield Century City, the open-air mall with additional dining and shopping options.\n",

        "content": "A loan tied to the\nOne Market Plaza\noffices in San Francisco could spell trouble for its owners as its maturity date approaches.\nThe $850 million loan backed by the 1.6 million-square-foot office complex is set to mature in February of next year, and has meanwhile been placed on a lender watch list, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nThe buildings\u2019 owners, Paramount Group and Blackstone, haven\u2019t declared what they plan to do regarding the maturity. There\u2019s still a few more months for the entities to discuss their plans with lenders, and it isn\u2019t the first time they\u2019ve faced a looming maturity date. They previously\npaid down a loan\nbacked by the complex from $975 million to $850 million in order to\nsecure an extension of the loan\u2019s maturity\nfrom February 2024 to February 2026; that deal also includes a one-year extension option that would push the loan\u2019s maturity to February 2027.\nAs of June, One Market Plaza was 67 percent occupied, down from 90 percent at the end of last year. Traditionally, borrowers have trouble refinancing office buildings with an occupancy rate of less than 70 percent, according to Morningstar data cited by the Business Times.\nOccupancy at One Market Plaza is expected to plummet even further as more companies move out.\n\nGoogle contributed to the fall earlier this year by\nnot renewing its lease for 342,000 square feet\nthis spring. Law firm Morgan Lewis &amp; Bockius is moving to the Transamerica Pyramid and will let its 150,000-square-foot-lease expire early next year. Visa moved into its new offices at Mission Rock last year, though it still has a 160,000-square-foot lease at One Market Plaza expiring next September. It remains unclear if Autodesk, which has a 109,000-square-foot lease in the building expiring next June, will remain at the complex.\nWith the departures of Morgan Lewis &amp; Bockius and Visa, Paramount and Blackstone could face an occupancy rate of less than 50 percent. In order to\nattract tenants\n\u2014 and in turn, likely improve its chances of securing a possible refinancing deal \u2014 Paramount announced earlier this year that it plans to ramp up its amenities programming at One Market.\nThe buildings aren\u2019t emptying out completely, however. New tenants such as\nlaw firm Simpson Thacher\nand Postman have planted flags at the complex, with Simpson Thatcher taking 32,000 square feet of Google\u2019s former space and Postman grabbing 32,000 square feet of Visa\u2019s former offices.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Four properties in Moshe Silber\u2019s troubled New Orleans multifamily portfolio and a Pittsburgh apartment complex are nearing a sale to Lynd Group.\nSan Antonio-based Lynd Group is buying the New Orleans properties totaling 1,512 units for $26.12 million. Lynd is also buying a 115-unit apartment complex in Pittsburgh through the bankruptcy process of Silber\u2019s former company, according to court filings. Lynd is purchasing properties owned by CBRM Realty, one of Silber\u2019s many companies.\nSilber\u2019s 11,000-unit multifamily property empire collapsed after he pleaded guilty for his role in a commercial mortgage fraud scheme last year.\nSilber\nand his co-conspirators allegedly used a stolen identity to obtain an inflated $74 million loan from Fannie Mae and JLL for a rental property in Cincinnati, Ohio. Silber was sentenced to 30 months in prison last March.\nAfter Silber pleaded guilty to fraud, an independent fiduciary, Elizabeth LaPuma, was appointed to oversee two of Silber\u2019s companies, CBRM and Crown Capital, in September 2024. Meanwhile, Lynd, an established multifamily operator, took over management responsibilities of Silber\u2019s vast apartment portfolio.\nIn April 2025, a creditor of Silber\u2019s sought to auction off CBRM, leading LaPuma to put the company, which held thousands of 6,300 units in New Orleans, Pittsburgh, Flint, Michigan, Jackson, Mississippi and elsewhere, into Chapter 11 bankruptcy the following month. Silber remained the main equity holder of CBRM.\nIn bankruptcy filings, CBRM\u2019s attorneys claimed that Silber mismanaged the properties, which mostly consisted of low-income housing. They also claimed Silber \u201cextracted tens of millions (if not hundreds of millions of dollars) of value from those properties for his own benefit.\u201d\n\nSilber had obtained huge sums of money from bondholders and from lenders. He had nabbed about $200 million in financing from bondholders for his real estate portfolio and at least $450 million in mortgages. Silber\u2019s properties fell into neglect, yet he maintained a lavish lifestyle, including homes in London and upstate New York, and a private jet. (In a recent\nbankruptcy\nfiling, Silber claimed, however, he had no income, no assets, and was borrowing money from his father Zalman to cover his legal fees in bankruptcy).\nLynd will be acquiring four apartments in East New Orleans all built in the 1980s with high vacancies. The properties include: Carmel Brook Apartments, Carmel Spring Apartments, Laguna Reserve Apartments and Laguna Creek Apartments. The properties were put up for auction, but the auction was canceled.\nLynd\u2019s acquisition will pay off over $17 million of debtor-in-possession financing provided by a firm tied to entrepreneur and vice chairman of El Al airlines Daryl Hagler. It will also pay off Cleveland International Fund, which has a $4.5 million debt. As part of the deal, Lynd will provide bondholders up to 30 percent upside to any future sale or distribution of the properties.\nLynd will also acquire the Kelly Hamilton apartments in Pittsburgh through a credit bid of up to $9.3 million.\nOn October 6, LuPuma put an additional 42 companies, tied to Silber\u2019s properties throughout the country, including Pennsylvania, Alabama and Ohio, into bankruptcy protection.\n",

More than a show of strength, the $5 billion project reflects Dimon\u2019s push to anchor the firm\u2019s identity \u2014 and physical presence \u2014 in New York at a time when the city\u2019s economic dominance faces fresh political scrutiny.\nDimon\u2019s influence is all over the area, treating the HQ tower\u2019s design as a personal project, down to the Guinness tap imported for the 13th-floor pub. He divided top lieutenants into teams to oversee specific elements: trading floors under Daniel Pinto and Troy Rohrbaugh; client centers on the top floor under Mary Erdoes and Marianne Lake; and a wellness level \u2014 with a gym Dimon reluctantly agreed to \u2014 under other executives. The result is a corporate citadel organized like a microcosm of the firm itself.\n\nAs construction wrapped, JPMorgan shut down 47th Street for a barbecue celebrating the workers who built the tower. Dimon shmoozed alongside union leaders and told the crowd, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be here for a long time \u2014 obviously.\u201d\nThe party doubled as a soft launch for the bank\u2019s broader urban experiment: part office complex, part ecosystem.\nNext up, JPMorgan plans a $1 billion overhaul of 383 Madison and is weighing what to do with 250 Park, recently acquired for\nmore than $300 million\n, where options range from a new office tower to a company-run hotel for visiting employees.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The developer bought the site, home to an office building and accompanying\nparking lot\n, last October for $31.5 million, at the time the most expensive real estate deal in the Brea and La Habra area for the year leading up to the purchase.\nPrior to Manley\u2019s buy, 1698-1700 Greerbriar Lane was home to a\nMercury Insurance\noffice, though the firm is no longer in operation at the site.

        "content": "The summer rush on North Shore lakefront mansions didn\u2019t just make brokers happy \u2014 it made Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi look clairvoyant.\nThe nine priciest home sales in suburban Cook County this year have all been lakefront properties in New Trier Township \u2014 and nearly all traded for more than Kaegi\u2019s office said they were worth just a few months ago, according to\nCrain\u2019s\n. That\u2019s despite widespread complaints this spring, when the assessor\u2019s triennial revaluation of New Trier homes jacked up\nlakefront assessments\nby an average of 42 percent.\nIn\nWinnetka\nalone, four waterfront estates fetched between $9.5 million and $12 million. One mansion assessed at $10.8 million sold for $11.4 million in July. Another, pegged at $9.45 million, sold for $9.57 million. Of the nine top-tier New Trier transactions \u2014 stretching from Kenilworth to Glencoe \u2014 six sold for more than the assessor\u2019s figure, meaning Kaegi\u2019s valuations actually came in low.\n\u201cThe market is a test of our work,\u201d Kaegi told the outlet. \u201cThis shows we passed the test.\u201d\nThree properties fell outside that pattern. One was the record-breaking $31.25 million\nWinnetka estate\n, appraised at $34.86 million \u2014 too high. Another\nKenilworth\nsale went to a developer planning to split the parcel; its $6.8 million sale price was below the $8.49 million assessment. And one Glencoe deal, a neighbor buy-up, doesn\u2019t really count as an open-market comp.\n\nFor local property tax consultant Andrea Raila, who ran against Kaegi in 2018, the assessor\u2019s self-congratulation is misplaced. She argued that ultra-luxury valuations are guesswork, with too few comparable sales north of $12 million to justify Kaegi\u2019s models, saying it\u2019s \u201cridiculous\u201d to assume the market is validating the assessments.\nBut Jena Radnay of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, who brokered five of this year\u2019s top Winnetka deals, disagreed.\n\u201cHis figures are accurate,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the end of the day, the market says so.\u201d\nStill, Radnay warned that the surge may not last. New bluff-protection rules in Winnetka are restricting how much of a lakefront site can be developed, limiting terraces and boathouses that helped drive big-dollar deals.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The darkened Sears at Mesquite\u2019s Town East Mall is set for a second act \u2014 this time as the anchor of a mixed-use revival backed by city incentives.\nDallas-based Elm Creek Investments won approval this week for rezoning and an agreement to redevelop the 18-acre site at 1738 North Town East Boulevard, on the north edge of the 1 million-square-foot mall, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe plan calls for restaurants, a conference center and a possible 150-room hotel, with work expected to unfold over several years. The Mesquite City Council approved a 10-year, 1-cent sales tax rebate to support the project this week.\nElm Creek, operating as Elm Creek Real Estate, will be required to meet a series of performance milestones. By the end of next year, the developer must complete exterior renovations to the former Sears, begin parking lot construction and secure a 10-year lease with\nMain Event\n, which will occupy about two-thirds of the old department store with a 58,000-square-foot entertainment center. By July 2027, Elm Creek must have invested at least $25 million and prepped three pad sites for development.\nEconomic Development Director Kim Buttram said seven prospective tenants are already in talks to lease outparcels, including five first-time entrants to\nMesquite\n. One of the biggest targets: a Vidorra restaurant, for which Elm Creek could receive an additional $500,000 grant if it lands a five-year, 6,000-square-foot lease by next summer.\n\nThe redevelopment could reenergize\nTown East\n, which is Mesquite\u2019s top generator of property and sales tax revenue. Council Member Kenny Green called the mall a \u201ccash cow\u201d for the city. Elm Creek\u2019s deal is expected to generate at least $100,000 in new sales tax revenue in the first year, growing to $200,000 annually by the end of the agreement.\nA separate incentives package for the hotel is still being negotiated and could include state support. A 2019 hotel study identified the Town East site as the best location for a midsize conference center \u2014 and a global hotel brand has reportedly expressed interest.\nBuilt in 1971, Town East Mall still draws about 5 million visitors annually despite retail headwinds. The Sears site, shuttered in 2021, was the last of the once-dominant chain\u2019s North Texas stores. Town East Mall was recently pulled off the foreclosure auction block by\nBrookfield Properties\nafter resolving distress tied to a $160.3 million loan.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "There\u2019s one thing New York City mayoral candidates all agree on: property tax reform is a lightning rod.\nBut despite consensus that the system is unfair, there has yet to be any meaningful change.\n\u201cThe problem with property tax reform is you\u2019re going to have winners, and you\u2019re going to have losers, and the political system does not like having losers,\u201d Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo said during a mayoral forum hosted by Crain\u2019s on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s why no one wanted to go near it.\u201d\nWithout specifying exactly how, some of the candidates want to harness the energy around the issue.\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s event, a rare opportunity to see all three candidates under the same roof, Assembly member Zohran Mamdani said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d supports comprehensive reform to the city\u2019s lopsided property tax system.\nMamdani noted that he is on the Assembly\u2019s standing committee on real property taxation and that he wanted to introduce legislation to amend the tax system, but was told \u201cin no uncertain terms\u201d that the state was waiting on the mayor to deliver a citywide plan.\nPrevious administrations have promised and failed to change New York\u2019s property tax system. Mayor Eric Adams pledged to fix the city\u2019s property tax regime within his first year in office, and when that didn\u2019t happen, repeatedly\ncommitted\nto do so but did not deliver reform.\nMamdani also cited Tax Equity Now New York\u2019s nearly decade-old lawsuit challenging the system and recommendations made at the end of the de Blasio administration as potential paths forward.\n\u201cI think that there are a number of proposals that can make it easier with circuit breakers, also to ensure that any fix is not one that then creates a new level of burden on a different class of homeowners or owners of different sets of rental properties,\u201d he said.\nCuomo, acknowledging that likely nothing will change otherwise, said the courts may need to force the city\u2019s hand.\nHe cited TENNY\u2019s lawsuit, which argues that the city\u2019s property tax system is inequitable. Most recently, the group has\nasked\na state court to require the city to make changes to how one-, two- and three-family homes, as well as condo and co-ops, are assessed.\n\u201cThe legal case can actually be used, frankly, as a facilitating device to say, \u2018we have to do this,\u2019\u201d Cuomo said, adding that a court order would give City Council members political cover from the angry condo and co-op owners who would see their tax bills rise as a result of reform.\nEmbracing court-powered reform is a departure from previous administrations, which have argued that lawmakers should enact change.\nRepublican nominee Curtis Sliwa repeatedly noted the need to slash property taxes, alongside other taxes.\nThe pitch\nAt Wednesday\u2019s forum, the three mayoral contenders appeared separately, each making their case to the business community. For some that was a bigger challenge than others.\nMamdani acknowledged that he likely wasn\u2019t their \u201cdream\u201d candidate, but said he believes there is \u201cfar more commonality\u201d between their visions for the city.\nWhen asked who he is planning to hire if he becomes mayor, Mamdani demurred, but noted that he is talking to current and former members of the Adams administration, including former First Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer and City Planning head Dan Garodnick, in preparation.\nHe also\nechoed a comment\nmade by Real Estate Board of New York President Jim Whelan at a Crain\u2019s event last month. Whelan said his advice for Mamdani would be to hire the \u201cbest people,\u201d citing how former Mayor Michael Bloomberg built up his team. Mamdani also name-dropped Bloomberg and the need for mayors to surround themselves with top talent.\n\nMamdani\u2019s plan to freeze rents for stabilized apartments for four years, meanwhile, doesn\u2019t sit well with many in the real estate industry. When asked about the rent freeze, and the fact that this promise comes before the city\u2019s Rent Guidelines Board has had a chance to deliberate on the issue, Mamdani said the move would help align the board\u2019s actions with its own analysis of the city\u2019s rent stabilized housing stock. He pointed to increased landlord profits and stagnant tenant wages.\nLandlord groups have long\ncriticized\nthe board\u2019s reports detailing rises in buildings\u2019 net operating income because those calculations include market rate units.\nHe also said a freeze isn\u2019t meant to punish landlords and doesn\u2019t preclude other actions aimed at helping struggling property owners, including\nalternative insurance options\n, reforming property taxes and combatting rising utility rates.\nHousing timelines\nMamdani indicated that he wants to encourage the private sector to build more housing and said that in conversations with real estate leaders, he\u2019s been \u201ctaken aback\u201d by the fact that some of the largest costs they face in building housing is the \u201ccost of waiting.\u201d He mentioned the prospect of reforming the city\u2019s environmental review process.\nStill, he did not commit to supporting\nfour housing-related ballot questions\n, most of which are aimed at speeding up approval of housing projects in the city. He said he is glad that New Yorkers will get to decide these issues in November, but has not himself taken a position on the measures.\nThrowing his support behind the measures is politically tricky: Two powerful unions that have\nendorsed\nhis run for mayor, 32BJ SEIU and the Hotel and Gaming Trades Council, oppose the three most controversial questions that, if approved, weaken or skip the City Council\u2019s role in certain land use approvals.\nSliwa called the ballot measures \u201cCity of Yes on steroids,\u201d referring to the\nzoning changes approved last year\n.\n\u201cI am opposed to the City of Yes, that would destroy the residential makeup, especially of the outer boroughs,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a preservationist in many ways, which clearly these two candidates are not. Andrew Cuomo is in the back pockets of the developers and realtors as is his predecessor, Eric Adams.\u201d\nWhen asked what he would do to make it easier to build affordable housing, he pointed to inefficiencies at the Department of Buildings.\n\u201cThe Department of Buildings is often your enemy, whether you\u2019re making changes in your existing occupancy or you\u2019re trying to build a new facility,\u201d he said.\nHe has\npreviously said\nthat he would make cuts to the DOB to help pay for his proposed tax cuts.\nCuomo said a top priority if he is elected mayor will be building 500,000 new homes across 300 sites \u201csimultaneously,\u201d though it\u2019s unclear how that would be accomplished in terms of labor and financing if he was speaking literally.\nCrain\u2019s reporter Nick Garber asked Cuomo how he would work with a progressive City Council, and why the business community should have confidence that he could block leftist legislation, given the passage of significant reforms to the state\u2019s rent law in 2019 when he was governor.\nCuomo said vetoing the 2019 law would have been the politically easy route: The legislature had the votes to override a veto. He said he opted to negotiate for a better bill instead.\nHe said the City Council will be easier to wrangle because it is a lot smaller than the state legislature.\nThat idea could be put to the test with one of his latest proposals. During the forum, Cuomo revealed a new proposal to abandon the city\u2019s plan to close Rikers in favor of rebuilding the jail. The borough jail sites slated to replace Rikers would instead be used for housing and commercial use. Doing so would require buy-in from the City Council, which passed a law in 2019 to shutter and replace the complex with four new jails.\nCouncil member Sandy Nurse, who co-chairs the City Council Progressive Caucus, called the proposal \u201cinept\u201d on social media and said the City Council would not backtrack on the 2019 law.\n",

        "content": "Fuse Group is aiming to derail developer Brian Tuttle\u2019s strategy for keeping control of his Mainstreet at Tuttle development site in Royal Palm Beach.\nFort Lauderdale-based Fuse, led by Eyal Peretz, on Sept. 29 filed a motion to dismiss a Chapter 11 petition in Miami federal court filed this month by the\nTuttle entity\nthat owns 38 acres on the southwest corner of U.S. 441 and Southern Boulevard.\nThe developer is planning Mainstreet at Tuttle, a mixed-use project with 400,000 square feet of retail, 401 apartments, a 125-key hotel, nearly 83,000 square feet of medical offices and three parking garages with 3,435 total spaces. The development has not broken ground.\nFuse alleges the Chapter 11 petition is a \u201cbad faith\u201d attempt by\nTuttle\nto delay a court-ordered sale of the development site.\nThe Tuttle entity filed for bankruptcy on the same day the property was scheduled to be sold at a foreclosure auction. Proceeds would have satisfied a $47.4 million judgment Fuse won in July tied to\nthree loans\nthat the developer allegedly defaulted on.\nAs part of its motion,\nFuse\nattached an email Tuttle sent in July 2024 to contractors working on Mainstreet at Tuttle and other project stakeholders in which he outlined his plan to avoid losing the development site, as well as explaining his difficulties landing a new equity partner.\nIn the July 21, 2024 email, Tuttle wrote, \u201cI will then file a bankruptcy\u2026this will buy us another year at a minimum\u201d if he was unsuccessful in landing a new partner by the time Fuse\u2019s foreclosure complaint was concluded. Fuse filed the lawsuit in Palm Beach County Court last year.\n\nFuse and its attorney, Josh Rubens with Miami law firm Kluger Kaplan, declined to comment.\nIn a phone interview with\nThe Real Deal\n, Tuttle accused Fuse of taking his email out of context and misrepresenting his intentions. \u201cI was trying to delay [in order] to find an equity investor to pay them and the other creditors,\u201d Tuttle said. \u201cWe will provide adequate proof that we have worked very hard and with numerous groups with the sole purpose to pay them back.\u201d\nFuse\u2019s goal is to \u201cwipe out all the other creditors and not give them anything,\u201d Tuttle added.\nThe email also noted Tuttle\u2019s difficulty last year drumming up new investors due to market conditions and the uncertainty of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cI have presented the deal to over 200 groups in the last 14 months,\u201d Tuttle wrote. \u201cI have been unable to get a group to invest as a co-developer or LP equity partner.\u201d\nIn all capital letters, Tuttle claimed that the groups he reached out to all cited high interest rates and insurance costs for turning him down: \u201cTHESE GROUPS DO NOT WANT TO TAKE DEVELOPMENT RISK AT THIS TIME.\u201d\nWhile he claimed to have JP Morgan ready to provide a construction loan, the Mainstreet at Tuttle project still needed an additional $30 million to be built, Tuttle wrote.\nTuttle told\nTRD\nthat market conditions have become more favorable for investors, and that he has now found an equity partner that can provide capital to pay back Fuse and restart the project. The Mainstreet at Tuttle ownership entity will be disclosing more information about its new partner in its reorganization plan that will be submitted to the court soon, Tuttle added.\n\u201cBefore, you had uncertainty of Trump and the election, the uncertainty of interest rates and the uncertainty surrounding the absorption of existing apartments,\u201d Tuttle said. \u201cSince then, things have taken a huge shift. There is general agreement that interest rates are going down\u2026and the absorption of apartments is exceeding everyone\u2019s expectations.\u201d",

        "content": "Residents in one Alameda neighborhood could lose their only grocery store and shopping center to hundreds of new residences.\nDenver-based developer\nThe True Life Companies\nfiled a preliminary application to build more than 300 homes on the site of the Harbor Bay Landing shopping center, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The property owner is Harbor Bay Landing LLC, purportedly a Burlingame-based private real estate investor.\nThe retail complex is anchored by a Safeway, the only grocery store on Bay Farm Island. Though the grocery store provides a critical food store for locals, Harbor Bay Landing has become increasingly vacant as tenants have closed up shop in recent years. In the City of\nAlameda\n\u2019s\nhousing element\n, officials identified Harbor Bay as an ideal site to build new housing in order to meet its state-mandated housing goals.\nThe location was indicated by the city as one of its community mixed-use combining districts, which encourages developers to include ground-floor retail and space for a grocery store in their plans. True Life is looking to get around that by requesting a concession to waive the mixed-uses requirement in their plans.\nTrue Life plans to demolish the existing 130,000 square feet of commercial space to clear the way for 305 new homes. Of those, 88 would be rental apartments and 217 would be for-sale townhomes.\n\nThe residences would include 50 units set aside for affordable housing, 22 of which would be designated for moderate-income residents, 12 at the low-income level and 16 at the very-low-income level. In Alameda County, moderate income is generally\ndefined\nas a maximum of $134,250 for one person, while low-income is a maximum of $87,550 and very-low-income is less than $55,950.\nBy including affordable units in its plan, True Life will be able to bypass certain requirements for the project. The plan applies SB 330, which streamlines the entitlement process, locks in current planning code laws and limits the number of public hearings on a project in an effort to get shovels in dirt faster.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be True Life\u2019s first\nproposal in the Bay Area\n.\nIn 2023, True Life filed a pre-application to demolish the Las Positas Office Plaza in the Hacienda Business Park in\nPleasanton\nand build housing in its place. In that proposal, the developer would replace the 110,000-square-foot office complex with 146 units. That plan is presumably dead in the water, though another developer, N17, filed an application in August to build 112 for-sale townhomes there.\nTrue Life also at one point aimed to build a 189-unit condo development in Hayward. That proposed project included 123 townhomes consisting of three- and four-bedroom units, 10,800 square feet of ground-floor commercial space, an urban park and a dog park.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "\u201cYou need a building that actually works, not a building that just checks a lot of boxes.\u201d\nScott Short, former RiseBoro CEO\nOne failure of the real estate industry is clinging to LEED certification as the standard for eco-friendly buildings.\nLEED was all the rage for a while and remains the most popular way for owners to showcase how \u201cgreen\u201d their buildings are. But with carbon emissions now dwarfing other environmental concerns, what matters most is how efficient buildings are at heating and cooling.\nOperating costs are also crucial, especially for affordable housing.\nLEED does not ignore these metrics, but some of the ways developers rack up\nLEED points\nto achieve certification have little to do with them.\nScott Short knew this 15 years ago when he set out to build the state\u2019s first passive house multifamily building: a 24-unit affordable project with day care at\n803 Knickerbocker Avenue\nfor the Brooklyn-based nonprofit now named RiseBoro. (The honor ultimately went to\nanother RiseBoro project\nthat he started later but finished sooner.)\n\u201cWe were trying to do something new, to break the mold,\u201d said Short. \u201cOne of the things that attracted me to the passive house standard was, unlike LEED or these \u2018green building\u2019 [designations] where you get certified based on plans, with passive house it\u2019s really all about the performance of the building.\u201d\nAt the end of construction, a\nblower door test\ndetermines how leaky the building is.\n\u201cIf the building doesn\u2019t perform as you project it to, you\u2019re not going to get the certification,\u201d said Short, who was RiseBoro\u2019s housing director and later became CEO. \u201cYou need a building that actually works, not a building that just checks a lot of boxes during the design phase.\u201d\nIn the early 2010s, no passive house apartment buildings existed in New York, and city officials who controlled affordable housing subsidies were skeptical.\n\u201cWe had to go in for funding four times,\u201d Scott recalled, \u201cand chip away at the bureaucratic hurdles.\u201d\n\nContractors were also skittish about passive house construction and inflated their bids by 20 percent, Short estimated. \u201cIt was the novelty premium,\u201d he said.\nThat premium has largely disappeared as more contractors have become comfortable with the methods, equipment and materials needed to make a building virtually airtight, with carefully controlled ventilation.\nIn New York City, most affordable projects are now built this way, although they don\u2019t often seek passive house status because the certification process is expensive. Perhaps the biggest is the 277-unit\n425 Grand Concourse\nin the Bronx, finished in 2022 by Monadnock Construction and Dattner Architects. (Outside of affordable housing, a 352-unit\nCornellTech NYC residential building\ncompleted in 2017 is among the city\u2019s passive house pioneers.)\nI checked with Short\u2019s successor as CEO,\nKieran Harrington\n, to see how 803 Knickerbocker is doing a dozen years after opening. \u201cThere have been meaningful savings,\u201d he said.\nThe six-story, 35,000-square-foot building uses about\n20 percent as much energy\nas an average building of that size in the city. Its annual cost for gas, electricity and water is 62 cents per square foot, about half of the Housing Development Corporation\u2019s $1.12 benchmark.\nBut the benefits of the super-insulated building go well beyond cost savings, according to its architect, Chris Benedict.\n\u201cNot only do we have a very good air barrier on the exterior of the building to meet passive house [standards], we also create an air barrier between each apartment so that air, bugs, smoke, sound, none of these things can pass from one apartment to the other,\u201d she said in a\nYouTube video\n.\nBuildings guru Henry Gifford was a consultant on 803 Knickerbocker. His role, in part, was to ease the anxiety of its contractors. As the construction team met near the end of the project, a plumber worried about being blamed if the 400,000 BTU boiler proved too small to heat a 24-unit building.\nGifford didn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cThe boiler is not going to provide the heat,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to provide the heat\nand the hot water\n.\u201d\n\u201cNobody doubted I was taking full responsibility,\u201d Gifford recalled, \u201cand everyone calmed down.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Rule number one: Know your audience. Rule number two: Answer the question you want to answer, not necessarily the question asked.\nAt least that is the playbook I assume mayoral hopefuls were following as they made their case to an industry-heavy crowd on Wednesday morning at a\nforum\nheld by Crain\u2019s. Candidates abided by the second rule to varying degrees, though the moderators did their best to keep them on track.\nEach of the candidates took turns on the stage to talk about a range of topics, including property tax reform and housing policy. Because this wasn\u2019t a debate and the candidates weren\u2019t presented with the same questions, I\u2019m not going to compare the candidates\u2019 performances.\nInstead, here are superlatives for the real estate-related topics covered during the forum:\nMost likely to make landlords\u2019 heads explode:\nThe \u201crent-stabilized landlords make too much money\u201d claim\nAssembly member Zohran Mamdani said the Rent Guidelines Board\u2019s own data on landlord profits should result in a rent freeze for stabilized tenants. Every year when this data comes out, landlord groups\npoint out\nthat the RGB\u2019s Income and Expense report includes market-rate units and leaves out a slew of other costs. In other words, the number is not an accurate picture of how rent-stabilized owners are faring.\nNot to mention, the RGB already recommends ranges based on its own data, and these ranges tend to make both tenants and landlords unhappy.\nMost likely to make Yimbys throw their copies of \u201cOn the Housing Crisis\u201d against the wall:\nThe ballot questions dodge and low-density exceptions\nNone of the mayoral candidates gave a glowing endorsement of\nthese measures\non Wednesday. In fact, Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa vehemently opposes them, referring to the proposals as \u201cCity of Yes on steroids.\u201d\nCuomo wasn\u2019t asked (but his reps have called the proposals a\n\u201cno brainer\u201d\n), and Mamdani said he hasn\u2019t taken a position. This was after he said he was \u201ctaken aback\u201d by the idea that one of the biggest costs developers face is caused by time passing, projects dragging. One of the biggest themes of those ballot measures is cutting approval timelines.\u00a0 \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\nAt one point, Crain\u2019s reporter Nick Garber asked Cuomo about a line in his housing plan that states that low-density neighborhoods should be spared from rezonings, \u201cwith limited exceptions such as transit-oriented development,\u201d until \u201cthe impact of recent rezoning efforts are absorbed in these areas.\u201d\nInitially, Cuomo rejected the idea, saying that what he has said is \u201cyou have to take the characteristics of a neighborhood into consideration.\u201d Then, he was helpfully reminded of the above quotes in his housing plan and said, \u201cI get this political sensitivity, and I get the City of Yes and what everybody went through, but it\u2019s going to be on a case-by-case basis, and all of it is going to be hard, by the way.\u201d I reiterate:\u00a0 \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\nMost likely to earn points with real estate and other business leaders:\nThe Michael Bloomberg name drop\nIf I had a nickel for every time a real estate source has spoken wistfully of the Bloomberg administration, I would have\u2026I don\u2019t know, $7?\nIn any case, mentions of the former mayor fall into the previously mentioned \u201cknow your audience\u201d rule. All three candidates mentioned an aspect of Bloomberg\u2019s approach to being mayor that they admire and/or want to replicate.\nMost likely to grab headlines because, holy cow, someone actually made news at this thing:\nThe Rikers reboot\nThere\u2019s nothing like the excitement of an event where a speaker breaks news, until you realize that another publication was given the news the day before under embargo. I\u2019m not bitter.\n\nCuomo announced that as mayor, he would abandon plans to close Rikers and build four borough-based jails. Instead, he would rebuild Rikers and use the four sites for housing and commercial use.\nThe New York Times was first to report the proposal.\nMost likely to make\nTRD\neditors say \u201cWait, what?\u201d:\nThe \u201csimultaneous\u201d housing pledge\nCuomo said his first big project as mayor would be to build 500,000 housing units across 300 sites \u201csimultaneously.\u201d That \u201csimultaneously\u201d raises a lot of questions, but most critically: How?\nMost likely to be harder than it looks:\nProperty tax reform\nCall me pessimistic, but a lot of mayors have promised to tackle this issue, and it hasn\u2019t happened. The candidates didn\u2019t offer up specifics, though Cuomo said he believes the courts will have to force the city and state to the table. More on that\nhere\n.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nNow that Pacific Park has a\nnew development team\n, how will the vision for the remaining sites change? Who will pay for a platform over the rail yard? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Less than two months after the Midtown South rezoning, an office-to-residential conversion in the neighborhood is already in the works. Sheridan Wall\nreports\nthat Marty Burger and Andrew Heiberger paid $25 million for 29 West 35th Street with plans to convert it into 107 studio apartments.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Outdoor gear and clothing store REI is closing its Soho flagship store in 2026,\nCurbed reports\n. Stores in Paramus, N.J., and Boston, Mass., are also closing next year.\n\u2014 The NYPD\u2019s highest-ranking uniformed officer, Chief of Department John Chell, is retiring after less than a year in the role,\nGothamist reports\n. Chief Michael LiPetri will assume the position on an interim basis.\n\u2014Three state judges filed a lawsuit this week challenging New York\u2019s mandatory retirement age for judges,\nthe Times Union reports\n. The state constitution caps the age for judges at 70.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$7.3 million\nfor a pre-war cooperative unit at 1100 Park Avenue in Carnegie Hill. Jane R. Andrews and John Cronin of Coldwell Banker Warburg\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$19.5 million\nfor a 33,374-square-foot, mixed-use property at 6 Greene Street in Soho. It has six stories and 12 residential units.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$23 million\nfor a 4,603-square-foot condominium unit at 555 West 22nd Street in Chelsea. Shaun Osher with CORE NYC has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 133,619-square-foot, 160-unit residential project at 525 Wales Avenue in Mott Haven in the Bronx.

        "content": "Manhattan\u2019s rental market is cooling, but not by much.\nThe median rent for a brokered apartment in Manhattan was $4,550 in September, down ever so slightly from the month before, but still up more than 8 percent over last year, according to a monthly report from appraiser Miller Samuel for Douglas Elliman.\nAcross the city, rents are in a holding pattern. After beginning a streak of\nhigh prices in February\n, they\u2019ve since passed peaks and continued bobbing at the top of the chart. Although the pressures that pushed rents up are easing off, there\u2019s unlikely to be a significant decline in prices anytime soon, said Jonathan Miller, the report\u2019s author.\n\u201c[The only] economic force that could drive rents lower would be a severe recession,\u201d said Miller.\nFor the past several months,\nelevated mortgage rates have kept would-be buyers\nin the rental market, driving up demand for those units, Miller said. In July, Manhattan rents set a new all-time record at $4,700.\nMortgage rates have begun to come down slightly, and demand typically falls in autumn. But those headwinds are not enough to really turn the march of rents around, Miller said.\nThe market remains tight. Inventory in Manhattan was low for the month, at 9,244 listings, a decline of nearly 8 percent year over year. That could indicate a high number of lease renewals, Miller said. Renewals are typically at lower prices than new leases and are not captured in the report.\n\nLow turnover and high renewals may suit landlords just fine, as an uncertain economic picture makes locking in tenants look preferable to testing the market. And renters might be deciding that what they\u2019re seeing on StreetEasy just isn\u2019t worth it.\nTurnover may dip lower in the future if mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani wins the election and institutes a\npromised rent freeze on rent-stabilized apartments\n. That policy could put pressure on rents in market-rate apartments, Miller said, by lowering inventory and prompting landlords to make up money on any market-rate apartments they own.\nCompetition for a unit wasn\u2019t at record highs in September, but it was still elevated. About 22 percent of leases in Manhattan were subject to bidding wars, according to Miller. That number was 23 percent in Queens and 33 percent in Brooklyn.\nMedian rent for brokered apartments in Brooklyn was $3,925 in September, just $25 lower than\nthe median in August\n. Prices have risen 7.5 percent in the last year.\nInventory was down in Brooklyn as well. At 5,681, it was 3 percent lower than in August.\nThe median rent in Northwest Queens, which includes Astoria, Long Island City, Sunnyside and Woodside, was $3,650. That was a 4 percent increase year over year.\n",

The seller was a trust tied to\nRandy Fishman\n, widow of former Travelers Cos. CEO\nJay Fishman\n. The Fishmans purchased the 3,200-square-foot pad in 2010 for $4.2 million; it went up for sale in March for $7.3 million. The unit has three bedrooms, three and a half baths, an in-home gym and a private elevator landing. Coldwell Banker Warburg\u2019s\nJane Andrews\nand\nJohn Cronin\nhad the listing.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe priciest commercial deal recorded in the city clocked in at just $7 million. The\nRenaissance Youth Center\n, which provides educational and music programming for children in the South Bronx, purchased its building at\n3485 Third Avenue\nfrom an LLC tied to developer\nKiumarz Guela\nthat had owned the property for about two decades. The five-story building spans 33,500 square feet, pricing the deal at roughly $210 per square foot.\n\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nIn Flushing, portions of a mixed-use condominium building traded for $6.9 million. The seller was an affiliate of\nAmerasia Bank\n, and the buyer was\nFarrington Capital LLC\n. The commercial space and 8 of 12 of the property\u2019s residential condos were included in the transaction.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nAn LLC tied to\nSun Choi Tsang\noffloaded a development site at\n37 Meserole Street\nin East Williamsburg for $6.4 million. The purchaser was an LLC linked to\nZihang Chen\n, which took out $11.3 million in financing from an affiliate of\nS3 Capital\nfor the deal. Tsang had owned the property since the early 1990s and had planned to build a residential complex there.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nA sponsor unit at\n500 West 18th Street\nin Chelsea sold for just under $6 million. The buyer was an LLC led by\nPeter Spain\n, principal at Core Development, based in Southampton, Pennsylvania.

        "content": "After five years without a property tax hike, Evanston homeowners are facing a potential 12.9 percent increase next year under a $342 million draft budget proposed by City Manager Luke Stowe.\nThe proposal calls for filling a $6.5 million gap in the budget with the tax increase to balance the budget and maintain city services. If approved by the City Council, the hike would raise annual tax bills for the owners of median-value properties by $174 to $400, the Chicago Tribune first\nreported\n.\nThose figures include the library\u2019s proposed levy increase and are based on 2023 Cook County tax rates, since 2024 data is not yet available.\nFor a condo valued at the city\u2019s median of $294,000, the owner would owe roughly $174 more. A single-family homeowner with a $675,000 valuation would pay about $400 more, while a\nmultifamily building owner\nwith a property worth $620,000 would see a $367 bump.\nThe proposal ends a half-decade of tax stability driven by one-time revenue sources, federal stimulus funds and inflation-fueled growth, the city manager said.\n\nThe\ncity\u2019s\nrising pension obligations for police and firefighters, guided by a new funding policy aimed at meeting state mandates by 2040, are a major cost driver.\nAlthough the proposed 12.9 percent increase applies only to the city and library\u2019s share of the tax bill, that portion makes up just 19 percent of an\nEvanston\nhomeowner\u2019s total tax load. The city said the hike would translate to a 2.4 percent rise in the total bill, with roughly two-thirds of all property tax revenue flowing to local school districts.\nEvanston\u2019s\nbudget also includes fee hikes \u2014 including $7 a month more for yard waste and bulk pickups \u2014 and $91.5 million in capital spending. Projects include nearly $32 million for street and sewer work, $17 million for park improvements across multiple sites, $11.7 million for city facility upgrades, and $7 million for an electrical reliability project at the Evanston Water Plant, funded largely by regional partners.\nPublic hearings begin next week, and a final council vote is expected later this fall.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

It was the third quarter\u2019s largest office transaction.\nMason Creek I, at 21420 Merchants Way, is a 135,000-square-foot office building constructed in 2013. Nicola Wealth has owned it since 2015. It\u2019s about 24 miles west of downtown Houston.\nThe property is in Houston\u2019s Katy submarket, which accounted for 7.8 percent of leasing activity in the third quarter. It ranked sixth in terms of submarkets with the largest amount of positive absorption. West Loop and the\nEnergy Corridor\ntopped the list; both logged more than 200,000 square feet of positive absorption.\nHouston\u2019s office market has been\nslow to recover from the pandemic\n, but the market indicators are gradually improving.\n\nThe metro\u2019s overall vacancy rate dropped from 27.9 percent a year ago to 27.4 percent. In the third quarter last year, the market saw\n23,700 square feet of negative absorption\n. This year, 555,000 square feet was absorbed in July through September, marking the second quarter in a row that more space was leased than vacated, marking the first sustained positive absorption since 2019, Colliers said.\nThe flight to quality office trend seen throughout the country is also at play in Houston.\nThe average vacancy of properties built in the last decade is 11.9 percent, highlighting companies\u2019 preference for newer office space with top-of-the-line amenities.\nFor example, Skanska delivered Norton Rose Fulbright Tower, a 386,000-square-foot office building at 1550 Lamar Street, last year. The 28-story building is 62 percent leased, with\nThird Coast Infrastructure\nbeing the latest company to sign a deal to move into the trophy building.\n",

        "content": "A waterfront estate hit the market in Austin for $11 million, as a shrinking buyer pool pushes ultra-luxury properties onto public listing services.\nThe eight-acre property at 11941 Overlook Pass includes a 4,000-square-foot main house as well as a guest house and a saloon-styled party hall. The property is one of a few that fronts Barton Creek, a popular Austin recreational spot.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to build on Barton Creek,\u201d said Douglas Elliman agent Jeanne Parker, who has the listing along with with Julie Mack.\nParker and Mack are expecting a buyer who values privacy and family considerations.\n\u201cThree of the best private schools in Austin are within a 10- to 15-minute drive of this property,\u201d Parker said.\n\u201cA lot of celebrities live there, a lot of professional athletes, because of the privacy. They don\u2019t like drones following them around, and you can\u2019t do that here,\u201d Mack said.\n\nMost agents would prefer to market a property of this price in private. However, fewer buyers means more luxury homes are hitting the MLS, Mack said.\nAustin has one of the\nhighest median days on market\nof any luxury market in the country, according to Redfin. Toward the end of the hot season, the market overall had more than two sellers for every buyer, making Austin one of\nthe most seller-saturated markets in the country\n.\nAs a result, price cuts have become more common for luxury homes in the area. The two most expensive homes sold on the MLS last week\ncut their asking prices\nbefore selling, and one spent over 190 days on the market.\nWhile Parker and Mack are marketing the nearby schools, most people who have taken an interest in the property are retired grandparents, the agents said. Single-family properties in the area are attracting more luxury buyers than\ncondos\nare, suggesting that the tech industry\u2019s waning interest in Austin is siphoning more single, childless workers than parents back to the coast, Parker speculated.\n\u201cDuring the pandemic, we had a lot of people coming in from California, which raised the prices, and that has slowed down,\u201d Parker said.\n\u201cMost of our people are coming in from New York, New Jersey, Chicago, probably for tax reasons,\u201d Mack said.\n",

        "content": "Dallas is finally trying to unload one of its biggest real estate embarrassments after years of dysfunction.\nThe city listed 7800 North Stemmons Freeway, an 11-story 228,300-square-foot office building that has cost at least $29 million in taxpayer funds after an initial purchase price of $14.1 million. CBRE is marketing the site as an \u201coutstanding redevelopment or owner-user opportunity,\u201d the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nThe property, built in 1981 and renovated about a decade ago, was supposed to house the city\u2019s beleaguered permitting office.\nBut according to an April after-action report from\nCity Manager\nKimberly\nTolbert\n, the building was so structurally unsound that the city couldn\u2019t even secure a certificate of occupancy. Despite sinking another $15 million into repairs, the site remains uninhabitable, forcing staff back to their old digs on East Jefferson Boulevard.\nFallout from Tolbert\u2019s report included the short-term suspension of any public real estate purchases unless previously approved by the\nCity Council\n, as well as a review of the city\u2019s working agreement with CBRE going forward and to finalize a request for proposal for a comprehensive citywide\nreal estate master plan\n.\n\nIt\u2019s also been a costly blunder to maintain: Dallas is spending roughly $73,000 a month on security and upkeep. The city recently pulled permits \u2014 totaling nearly $650,000 \u2014 to install a new fire alarm system, even as it moves to offload the property. CBRE\u2019s marketing materials highlight the building\u2019s 5-acre site, flexible zoning and proximity to the Medical District, but the listing is unpriced and being sold strictly \u201cas-is, where-is.\u201d\nThe city\u2019s decision to buy the building in 2022 was made under then\u2013City Manager\nT.C. Broadnax\n, following what Tolbert later called \u201conly a surface-level review\u201d by JLL.\nDallas officials, including Council Member Chad West, confirmed they only learned the property had quietly hit the market after inquiries from the media. CBRE broker Patrick Benoist, who worked on the deal, declined to comment to the outlet, citing instructions from his client \u2014 the city. Offers are due in about three weeks, after which the council will review its options privately.\nCommercial brokers said the property is likely a teardown, given its condition and location along the moribund Stemmons Corridor. City Hall is hoping to cut its losses and turn a costly cautionary tale into someone else\u2019s redevelopment play.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "If the Florida condo crisis were a hurricane, the worst of the storm appears to have passed by Palm Beach.\nWhile the government doesn\u2019t control the weather, it does have command over the regulatory environment that created difficulties for the state\u2019s condo market. In the wake of the deadly Champlain Towers collapse in Surfside, lawmakers scrambled to prevent another tragedy with a slate of\nnew safety laws\nthat have their own consequences. The legislation mandated that condos complete milestone inspections and reserve studies. While these rules apply to every residential building 30 years or older, the effects are evolving into a story of the haves and have-nots, especially when the multimillion-dollar assessments roll in.\nAs the statewide condo market continues to absorb the shock of regulations,\nPalm Beach\n, where money is no issue, illustrates how affluent communities are better equipped to handle the impact.\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s reading the same doom and gloom about this market,\u201d said Scott Gordon, a Douglas Elliman agent in Palm Beach. \u201cFor the luxury market, those buildings are in better shape than they\u2019ve been in a decade.\u201d\nWhile Palm Beach\u2019s oceanfront estates and nine-figure residential sales are perhaps better known, the island also has dozens of condominiums, both in town and on the South End, the majority of which are older than 30 years and subject to the new safety laws. With the\nregulations, rising insurance rates and competition\nfrom new development in West Palm Beach, agents said the island\u2019s condo market suffered in the first half of the year.\nBut as activity picks up ahead of the busy winter season, brokers say the sky is clearing for the island\u2019s aging condo supply. The median sale price for condos in Palm Beach has ticked up to $2.7 million, Redfin shows. One hundred sixty-four units are listed for sale, with prices ranging from $315,000 to $17.9 million, according to the listing site. Earlier this month, one Palm Beacher dropped\n$9.4 million\non a unit at Bellaria at 3000 South Ocean Boulevard after selling her home for $30 million.\nCosts for assessments and repairs are averaging between $75 and $100 per square foot, with most of the funds going to cover concrete restoration, Gordon said. That translates to $150,000 to $200,000 for a 2,000-square-foot condo. Brokers declined to comment on assessments of specific buildings.\n\u201cAll these buildings have either completed [assessments and repairs] or have almost completed them,\u201d said Corcoran Group\u2019s Dana Koch.\n\nElsewhere in South Florida, similar assessments are financially devastating for unit owners. Howard Konetz, who lives on a fixed income and owns a unit at Aventura\u2019s Mediterranean Village, told\nFox Business\nhe is facing a $224,000 assessment fee. He wanted to sell, but took the condo off the market after multiple price cuts failed to lure a buyer, Zillow shows.\nMarket insiders say Palm Beach\u2019s condo owners have deeper pockets than most. If a building had a problem, they had the money to throw at it. Now, the worst is behind them, and all of the improvements are a boon for resales, brokers say. Many buildings are in better physical condition and fiscal health than in recent years, thanks to the regulations. Design updates are also helping to close deals, said Elliman\u2019s Chris Leavitt.\n\u201cIt really highlights the buildings that are in perfect condition,\u201d said Leavitt, who pointed to the recently renovated Biltmore at 150 Bradley Place. Leavitt closed two sales in the building over the summer, which he credited in part to the updates.\nPalm Beach\u2019s older condo buildings benefit from immediacy; they are ready to use now, rather than the\nnew developments\nin West Palm Beach that have years-long waits. Buyers are also coming in educated and asking the right questions, agents say.\n\u201cBuyers have just gotten smart. They will ask, \u2018Have you done your milestone inspection? Have you done this? Have you budgeted for it?\u2019\u201d Corcoran\u2019s Suzanne Frisbie said.\nPricing is also playing an important role. Sellers are letting go of pandemic-era dreams, Gordon said.\n\u201cPrices are coming down to reflect the reality of the market,\u201d he said. \u201cIn order to get a lot of these deals done, the sellers have been much more receptive to paying off special assessments just to move the deals forward.\u201d\nKoch said one of his sellers paid $62,000 to cover assessment fees and move a deal along. Some buildings are adopting \u2018due on sale\u2019 clauses to mandate sellers pay off their share of assessments, including the Cove at 2784 South Ocean Boulevard, Meridian at 3300 South Ocean Boulevard and Halcyon at 3440 South Ocean Boulevard. Gordon said he had a deal in the Meridian, which took out a $10 million loan for its repairs, that involved a $122,000 payment for its \u2018due on sale\u2019 clause.\n\u201cI think every contract that we\u2019ve written lately has a \u2018due on sale\u2019 clause for the special assessment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe seller in almost every sale that we\u2019ve done is responsible for the full payment of the assessments.\u201d",

        "content": "Developers have filed permits for the construction of an eight-story\nmultifamily development\nin Santa Monica.\nVirginia-based Orr Partners, in partnership with designer Tighe Architecture, has filed plans to build the residential property at 1723 Cloverfield Boulevard, located near the 26th Street/Bergamot Metro station, L.A. Yimby\nreported\n. The project would\nreplace a one-story office building\nand adjacent parking lot.\nThe proposal calls for Orr to build 330 studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments across eight floors above ground. Underground, residents will have access to three levels of subterranean parking accommodating 357 vehicles and additional space for bicycles.\nOf the proposed apartments, 10 percent of them, or 33 units, will be set aside as deed-restricted affordable housing for moderate-income, low-income, and very-low-income households. In Los Angeles County, moderate income for one person is\ncategorized\nas making less than $89,550 annually, while low-income is a maximum of $84,850 and very-low-income falls under $53,000 for one person. By including affordable units in the development, the project qualifies for density bonus incentives, allowing the developer additional height and floor area than what zoning limits permit.\nThe ground floor includes floor-to-ceiling windows for resident amenities and lobby space, while units above have recessed balconies. The upper floors step back from the street\u2019s edge to create landscaped terraces and a rooftop green space. In addition to recessed balconies, residents will benefit from passive sustainability touches like solar shading as well as the planned landscaping to improve environmental performances.\n\nUnder its\nhousing element\n, the City of Santa Monica is required to build or plan for 8,874 new housing units by 2029. Of those, 69 percent must be priced at various affordable-income levels.\nThis summer, the City of Santa Monica put out a call to developers interested in\nbuying plots of city-owned land\nwith plans for affordable housing, with the largest of the three parcels just around the corner from Orr\u2019s proposed construction site. Interested developers can apply to purchase a 5.6-acre parcel at 2525 Michigan Avenue on the opposite side of\nBergamot Station Arts Center\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The closed deal came out to $13.5 million, exceeding her\noriginal asking price by $1.5 million\n, according to\nRealtor.com\n.\nCorcoran purchased the historic penthouse at 1158 Fifth Avenue for $10 million in 2015 and invested an additional $2 million in renovations to tailor the home to her taste.\nThe Corcoran Group founder has talked publicly about her longtime personal connection to the residence.\nHer relationship with the Upper East Side penthouse dates to 1992, when she was working as a messenger. One of her deliveries led her to the home, which she has described as captivating,\u00a0 despite being out of her financial reach at the time. She even asked the owner to keep her in mind if the property ever became available. In 2015, after being contacted by the owner, Corcoran purchased the property.\nShe later embarked on a complete overhaul, reconfiguring the upstairs and downstairs spaces, transforming a greenhouse area into an indoor/outdoor dining space, and upgrading the kitchen.\n\nThe enhanced home now has 11 rooms across two floors, with views of Central Park and the city\u2019s skyline.\nAfter nearly a decade as her primary residence, Corcoran decided to sell the penthouse due to her husband, Bill Higgins, struggling with the staircase that connected the two levels. They began searching for a single-story home to suit his mobility needs. Their search included a disappointing miss with an offer for a Fifth Avenue co-op formerly belonging to Hollywood icons\nPaul Newman and Joanne Woodward\n.\nCorcoran has relocated to a single-floor penthouse located nearby in the uptown neighborhood.\nThe real estate heavyweight also this year lost her Pacific Palisades trailer home in the\nCalifornia wildfires\n.

        "content": "Nearly a year after a group of unit owners at a two-tower condo on Brickell Avenue in Miami voted to oust their association president, a judge ordered that the board, including its president, turn over all records and control of the association.\nThat means Jacob Kassel, the board president who led the association\u2019s passage of a $21 million special assessment, the elimination of electronic voting and other\ncontroversial actions\n, is out at\n1060 Brickell\n, a two-tower, 45-story complex with 592 units at 1060 Brickell Avenue.\nMiami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Joseph Perkins ordered in late September that the board be replaced by Dorinda Spahr, Jermaine Jones and Javier Noriega. The Kassel-led board was also ordered to turn over all records and property of the\nBrickell\nassociation by last Friday, according to the court order. The order is part of the lawsuit the association filed against unit owner James Duddey and others who introduced the recall effort.\nThe ruling doesn\u2019t resolve the litigation involving owners and the\nassociation\n, but it marks a big win for the owners who twice voted to recall their board over the past year. And it reaffirms the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation\u2019s final order, issued in July, that certified one of the recall efforts. That order determined that the current board be removed and that the board turn over all records and association property, including checkbooks, within 10 business days. Spahr, Jones and Noriega were to be appointed to the board effective immediately. But the association appealed.\n\u201cThis case really illustrates some of the issues with the current versions of the recall laws,\u201d Haber Law attorney Jonathan Goldstein told\nThe Real Deal.\nGoldstein and his colleague, Ariella Gutman, represent unit owners Duddey, Spahr and Nu\u00f1ez and other owners.\nThe condo association\u2019s attorney, Marc Halpern, and Kassel did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\u201cOur outcome followed nearly a year of intense and costly legal battles against a board that refused to step down,\u201d Spahr, the new president, said. \u201cWe won this case because a committed group of owners united, they financially supported the cause and they were relentless.\u201d\n\nThe new board will remain in place at least until the annual election in November.\nLast November, an official election was not held because the Kassel-led association disqualified the three candidates (Spahr, Jones and Noriega), so the existing board remained in power. Jones and Noriega challenged this via a separate arbitration petition filed with the state, while Spahr and other unit owners sued the association in January, alleging that the November 2024 election was canceled \u201con the incorrect and improper stated basis that there were an insufficient number of candidates to hold an election,\u201d the lawsuit states.\nOwners previously told\nTRD\nthat they had spent more than half a million dollars on attorney fees since last year, in addition to funding the association\u2019s legal fees via their monthly dues. The group of owners said the special assessment, which called for work that included nearly $8 million in fa\u00e7ade restoration and $3.5 million in work to the garage and basement, was unwarranted for a complex that was completed in 2008 \u2014 17 years ago.\nIn a separate lawsuit, Jessica Bergman and Antonio Sevillano, a married couple, sued the condo association in December. Their complaint, seeking a class action, amended in January, alleged that the board\u2019s passage of the special assessment violated Florida law by failing to provide a description of the special assessment and by failing to allow unit owners to vote on it. Bergman and Sevillano alleged that the board\u2019s 2-1 vote on the assessment also violated the property\u2019s condo declaration.\nThe condo association\u2019s attorney, Halpern, told\nTRD\nthis summer that it is the board\u2019s fiduciary duty to maintain the property and make necessary repairs, and Kassel said that his priority was ensuring the property is safe.\nJudge Perkins\u2019 latest order was the result of a Sept. 26 hearing. Perkins found that Duddey had demonstrated a \u201csubstantial likelihood of success\u201d on the recall effort.\nPerkins wrote that the court found the association\u2019s violations of the Florida Condominium Act resulted in \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d His granting of a temporary injunction, he wrote, \u201cwill serve the public interest.\u201d\n",

The administration has further intensified the situation by blaming builders for the ongoing housing affordability crisis.\nThe situation worsened after Trump\u2019s post on social media, which criticized homebuilders for having millions of empty lots and urged them to begin constructing homes.\nPulte, grandson of\nPulteGroup\u2019s founder William J. Pulte\n, echoed the sentiment, claiming major homebuilders now control 50 percent to 60 percent of the market and bear the bulk of the responsibility to contribute to housing supply.\nPulte also said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would require disclosures for \u201cBig Builder\u201d loans, potentially increasing scrutiny on their practices.\n\nUrging builders to construct more homes could further harm the industry, given the existing unsold inventory and declining margins, Renaissance Macro Research economics head Neil Dutta told the outlet. He described Pulte\u2019s comments as \u201cbullying\u201d builders.\nThe hardest-hit stocks in the sector this year include LGI Homes, Champion Homes and Century Communities, each down more than 20 percent, while Lennar has dropped more than 8 percent. PulteGroup, on the other hand, has seen a 17 percent increase in its stock price.\nThe sector has seen a 19 percent decline in the last 12 months, a significant underperformance compared to the S&amp;P 500\u2019s 16 percent rally.\nMarket analysts have pointed out the underlying issues for builders, such as rising margin pressures due to increasing inventory, which has led to price reductions in critical markets. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, new-home supply is at its highest level since 2007.\nRising tariffs on softwood lumber and kitchen cabinets could increase the cost of a new home by more than $10,000, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Drew Reading warned last month, while the\noverall sentiment of homebuyers remains depressed\n.\n\u2013 Joel Russell",

        "content": "Officials have put a face to the start of the deadly Palisades Fire.\nJonathan Rinderknecht, a 29-year-old former Uber driver living in Florida, has been arrested and charged with federal arson for allegedly setting a fire in January that became the Palisades blaze, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n.\nRinderknecht, who reportedly lived in the L.A. area before moving to Florida this year, allegedly dropped off a passenger in the\nPacific Palisades\nnear where a fire was later discovered to have started just after midnight on Jan. 1. The 29-year-old purportedly walked up a hiking trail, took videos on his phone and listened to a rap song, \u201cUn Zder, Un The\u201d by French artist Josman, with a music video showing \u201cobjects being lit on fire,\u201d Bill Essayli, the U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles, said,\naccording\nto\nBloomberg and ABC News.\nEnvironmental sensors detected the beginnings of a fire in the early morning hours of Jan. 1, and Rinderknecht himself called 911 to report the fire. He allegedly fled the scene but returned after seeing fire trucks driving back up to where it started.\n\u201cThe fire continued to smolder and burn underground within the root structure of the dense vegetation,\u201d Essayli said. \u201cSo that fire started on Jan. 1, and it smoldered underground for about a week until on Jan. 7. Heavy winds caused this underground fire to surface and spread above ground, causing what became known as the Palisades Fire, one of the most destructive\nwildfires\nin Los Angeles city history.\u201d\nWhen federal authorities seized Rinderknecht\u2019s digital devices, they found an AI-generated image from Chat GPT depicting a burning city. The accused arsonist moved to Florida \u201cbecause he was aware that people might be looking for him,\u201d Essayli said.\nInvestigators spent months tracking down the fire\u2019s origins and even re-staged the blaze in an attempt to learn more about how it started. Kenny Cooper, Assistant Special Agent in Charge for the San Francisco Field Division of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said Rinderknecht bears sole responsibility for the kindling of the fire.\n\n\u201cThat fire burned deep within the ground, in roots and in structure, and remained active for several days,\u201d Cooper said,\nper\nthe L.A. Times. \u201cNo matter how good they are, they can\u2019t see that, right?\u201d\nThose who dealt with Rinderknecht knew him to be a relatively reserved person. \u201dHe kept to himself,\u201d one anonymous neighbor told the Times.\nAnother former neighbor, 39-year-old Peter Chang of\nHollywood\n, was shocked to learn Rinderknecht was accused of lighting the fire. \u201cHe was actually a really nice guy,\u201d Chang said.\nA former roommate who lived with Rinderknecht in the Palisades didn\u2019t believe the suspect would do such a thing. \u201cI can only tell you the Jonathan I know would never do anything like that,\u201d the anonymous roommate told the Times. He noted that Rinderknecht would sometimes \u201cjust start talking fast and get bratty with people who confronted him. But he wouldn\u2019t get violent; he would maybe just smoke some pot and go to sleep.\u201d\nRinderknecht\u2019s preliminary hearing is set for Oct. 17.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Located at the\nCME Center\nin the West Loop, the firm plans on bringing 100 new jobs to Chicago next year.\nThe deal extended Arrive\u2019s commitment to the two-tower complex through 2037. It\u2019s the third expansion for Arrive since the firm set up shop there a decade ago. Terry Herlihy of NAI Hiffman represented Arrive in the deal. Ellen May and Isabella Rapken negotiated for\nthe landlord\n.\nThe move bucks the broader trend of contraction across the Loop, where downtown office users have collectively shed more than 2 million square feet over the past two years, according to CBRE.\nMany firms are rethinking their office space needs amid hybrid work patterns, leaving landlords scrambling to fill gaps.\n\nBut transportation logistics firms \u2014 long anchored in Chicago \u2014 have proved an exception. Companies such as MoLo Solutions, Loadsmart and Total Quality Logistics have all grown their downtown presence since 2020, riding a post-pandemic surge in e-commerce and supply chain demand.\nArrive has about 470 employees in\u00a0 its Chicago office, and its headcount is expected to top 570 next year. The company\u2019s fast growth \u2014 projected to lift this year\u2019s revenue 35 percent year-over-year to $2.5 billion \u2014 drove the need for more space. The firm also touted Chicago\u2019s talent pool.\nArrive\u2019s employees are largely in the office full-time, and the lease will consolidate its offices within CME Center in a contiguous space. The buildout will be phased through next year, with completion slated for October.\nNew York-based\nTishman Speyer\nrecently modernized the CME Center lobby and retained other key tenants \u2014 including\nBP\n, which earlier this year renewed its 240,000-square-foot lease through 2032. The 2.3 million-square-foot complex is about 85 percent leased, per CoStar.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s recent call to jail Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker is just the latest smackdown in a long personality rivalry between the two real estate billionaires.\nThe two have sparred over wealth, immigration, crime and democracy, with Pritzker recently questioning Trump\u2019s mental fitness and suggesting he has dementia, according to a\nWall Street Journal\nreport.\nBut the clash started with a decades-old Manhattan hotel dispute involving Pritzker\u2019s late uncle.\nThe bad blood first surfaced in 1992, in a fight over the ownership of the Grand Hyatt hotel in New York. Trump owned half and the Pritzker family of Chicago owned the other half. When the Priztkers pushed for\u00a0 and the Pritzkers wanted an expensive upgrade to the property.\nTrump saw the demand, which required more cash from each owner, as an attempt to take advantage of him at his weakest moment, as his three casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, were in Chapter 11 at the time, according to a\nWall Street Journal story published in 2016\n.\nTrump sued the Pritzkers, accusing them of civil racketeering to force him out of the deal, an allegation they denied.\n\u201cI called Jay [Pritzker] and said, \u2018You\u2019re a bad guy, Jay. I\u2019m going to kick your ass,\u2019\u201d Trump told the Journal in 2016.\n\nTrump later settled the suit and the Pritzkers\u2019 Hyatt Corporation bought his half of the property for $140 million. Jay Pritzker, JB\u2019s uncle and Trump\u2019s main antagonist in the drama, died in 1999.\nMore recently, the Illinois governor has clashed with the president over Trump\u2019s claims of crime and immigration issues in the Windy City.\nTensions reached a fever pitch last week after federal agents with the Department of Homeland Security\nraided a building on Chicago\u2019s South Shore\n, resulting in the arrests of 37 people and outcry from local officials over the atypical detainment of tenants, including children, during the operation.\nThe raid raised questions about\nlandlord and tenants\u2019 rights in the city\namid an escalation in federal scrutiny,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported.\nTrump this week deployed 300 Illinois National Guard members and 200 Texas troops to Chicago. Pritzker condemned the move as unconstitutional, and the state filed a lawsuit seeking a restraining order. Trump responded to Pritzker\u2019s rebukes of immigration agents on the ground by saying he, along with Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, \u201cshould be in jail.\u201d\nThe governor isn\u2019t the only Pritzker family member still engaging in the long-running clash with Trump.\nJB\u2019s sister Penny, who served as finance chair for Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaign, has engaged in recent months\nin a separate battle with the Trump administration\nover antisemitism claims at Harvard University, where she now serves as a senior fellow on its governing board.\n\u2013 Joel Russell",

It\u2019s expected to be listed for $13.5 million, or $2,113 per square foot.\nCompass\u2019 Josh Flagg has the listing.\nRecords show Hawn and Russell bought the property in 2004 for $4.1 million and held it for over a decade, before selling it in 2017 for $6.9 million. The seller is a trust tied to Champion Real Estate Company founders Robert and Marjorie Champion, according to property records.\nThe Santa Monica-based real estate firm began in 1987 and focuses on multifamily, retail, office, mixed-use and adaptive reuse projects. It has invested more than $2 billion into properties since the firm was founded, according to its website.\nThe Champions invested in the Capri Drive home and renovated it before placing the traditional-designed property on the market.\n\nSeveral features of the home lend to entertaining, including a bedroom conversion to a temperature-controlled wine tasting room, a pool, fire pits, barbecue area, outdoor dining and putting green. Other highlights include four fireplaces, a den with its own skylight and primary suite touting a custom walk-in closet and a connected bonus room.\nFlagg said in a statement to\nThe Real Deal\nthat the\nPalisades\nis seeing \u201crenewed momentum.\u201d\n\u201cWith many lots being sold in the aftermath of the fires, there are few move-in ready homes available, and this street remains one of the rare areas untouched,\u201d Flagg said.\nRodeo Realty\u2019s Jimmy Heckenberg and The Agency\u2019s Santiago Arana currently hold the Palisades\u2019 highest-priced listing, located at 766 Paseo Miramar. The 18,000-square-foot, new-build went on the market in June for $54 million and was relisted in August for $39 million, or $2,123 per square foot.\nThis year\u2019s priciest known residential sale in the Palisades was\n1124 Napoli Drive\n, which closed off market in late August for $25.8 million, or $2,437 per square foot. The Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Lea Porter and Carolwood Estates\u2019 Zac Mostame represented the seller and buyer.\n",

In May, Wells Fargo filed a foreclosure complaint against the Bridge Investment entities that owned the 24.4-acre assemblage, alleging default on a $59.2 million mortgage.\nAs part of its purchase for all three buildings, Hamilton assumed the mortgage, records show.\nHamilton plans to tear down the buildings at 9725 Northwest 117th Avenue and at 10451 Northwest 117th Avenue, and replace them with two industrial facilities spanning more than 300,000 square feet, a press release states. The office building at 9675 Northwest 117th Avenue will remain as part of the new development that will be called Flagler Logistics Center.\nHamilton plans to break ground on the warehouses next year and expects to complete the project in 2027, the release states.\nThe firm is also planning an office-to-industrial conversion in\nKendall\n, a suburban unincorporated neighborhood in southwest Miami-Dade. In August, Hamilton paid Baptist Health South Florida\n$12.3 million\nfor the office building at 14100 Southwest 136th Street with plans to redevelop the site into a 113,900-square-foot warehouse complex.",

        "content": "One of downtown Dallas\u2019 biggest and emptiest office towers is hitting the auction block, offering investors a chance to take a swing at a redevelopment play.\nThe chronically distressed Harwood Center, at 1999 Bryan Street, is up for sale through online auction platform Marketplace, with bids starting at $10 million and due Oct. 15, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. The\nbuilding\n, which spans 735,000 square feet, is just 47 percent leased, according to the listing. The starting bid amounts to $13.60 per square foot.\nSeller\nCW Capital\ntook over the 36-story asset from Fortis Property Group after a winning foreclosure-auction bid of $80 million in 2021. Fortis bought the property in 2006 and spent $10 million on renovations in 2011, according to Morningstar Credit.\nThe building\u2019s appraisal took a 20 percent haircut back in February, when it was valued at $51.2 million \u2014 just 41 percent of its 2014 valuation of $124 million, according to Morningstar. The Dallas Central Appraisal District values the property at $45.4 million.\nMajor tenants include engineering giant Jacobs, which has its global headquarters there, along with Omnicom Management and the General Services Administration.\nBuilt in the early 1980s, the tower is zoned for mixed-use, and redevelopment could include residential or hotel conversions. The property sits near the St. Paul DART station and the M-Line trolley, with more than 1,300 parking spaces.\n\nTranswestern\u2019s Mike Hardage, Stephen Simon and Steve Pumper are marketing the property.\nA 0.16-acre slice beneath the\nHarwood\nCenter is also for sale, listed by\nColliers\n. The listing offers ownership of a ground lease set to expire in 2077. The land takes in an annual rent payment of $65,232 according to the listing.\nDallas\u2019 Central Business District has one of the highest vacancy rates in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Buildings from the 1980s are faring worse as tenants demand newer offices with top-tier amenities and attractive locations.\nUptown\nattracts major tenants and new development \u2014 accounting for roughly three-quarters of the region\u2019s 2.7 million-square-foot pipeline \u2014 while downtown\u2019s aging stock has struggled.\nFor prospective buyers, that reality could cut both ways: Harwood Center\u2019s half-empty floors may look like a liability now, but for the right investor, they could be the blank canvas for downtown\u2019s next big conversion.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Instead, the board claims, he used it for unrelated real estate ventures through JDS.\nStern had agreed he would fix the defects before abandoning the project and leaving the board and unit owners to repair and replace issues in the building and completing proposed amenities, according to the complaint.\nStern served as president of the condo board from 2020 until February 2025, during which time the building\u2019s sponsors, through Stern, controlled the board, according to the complaint.\nThe board is seeking at least $5 million in damages.\n\nThe complaint lists a litany of alleged issues, including cellar drains that \u201crepresent the inverse of proper installation,\u201d leaking sinks and floors in units and dryers that \u201croutinely malfunction.\u201d\nThe board claimed that it hired architects to inspect the building\u2019s alleged defects every year starting in 2022, and that as of Aug. 2024, it was estimated to cost at least $4 million to cure defects in the common areas.\nStern and Largo Investments did not respond to requests for comment.\nGrowing pains\nThe 14-unit building, which was declared condo-effective in 2019, closed its first sale in 2020. It had a projected sellout of over $160 million, including non-residential units.\nThe lawsuit is not the first related to the work done at the site, which Stern and Brooklyn-based Largo Investments\npurchased for almost $35 million in 2014\n.\nIn 2020, Stern\nsued his equity partners\n, Largo co-founders Nicholas Werner and Nissim Ben-Nun, accusing them of misrepresenting their development experience, which the pair denied. A judge ruled in Werner and Ben-Nun\u2019s favor in 2023.\nStern has also weathered a flurry of lawsuits at his Billionaire\u2019s Row tower at 111 West 57th Street, which has seen a turnaround in formerly sluggish sales this year to the point where the building is now over 90 percent sold as of the end of September.\nStern, who primarily lives in Miami, has otherwise\nturned his professional sights to the Sunshine State\n, where JDS is behind high-profile projects,\nincluding branded condos\nbearing the names of\nDolce &amp; Gabbana\nand\nMercedes-Benz\n.\n",

The buyer is a land trust named after the address.\nThe home was completed last year by developer\nTodd Michael Glaser\n, according to the listing. The 0.3-acre property features 170 feet of water frontage, a pool and spa. It hit the market last year for $32.5 million, and was most recently asking $29.5 million with listing agent\nNelson Gonzalez\nof Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty.\nThe Corcoran Group\u2019s Eloy Carmenate and Mick Duchon represented the buyer.\n\nThe property previously traded for $9.5 million in 2021, records show. The new house has a chef\u2019s kitchen, master suite with a night bar, a wellness suite and a three-car garage. It\u2019s on Sunset Island III.\nThe selling entity is managed by Randall Smith and Heath Freeman, the multimillionaire co-founders of West Palm Beach-based Alden Global. It\u2019s one of a handful of properties tied to Smith and his wife, Barbara Stovall Smith, in Miami Beach.\nIn 2022, the Smiths were linked to the sale of the waterfront mansion at 34 Star Island Drive to LoanDepot\u2019s billionaire founder, Anthony Hsieh,\nfor $30 million\n. The previous year, they sold\u00a0 three homes in Palm Beach for $56 million.\nCompanies managed by the same attorney the Smiths used for the Star Island house and the Sunset Islands house also purchased the waterfront home at 4774 North Bay Road in 2021, had the house demolished and hired Glaser to build a new home. They sold the house in May of this year\nfor $29.5 million\n.\nThe Alden Global LLC\u2019s sale marks the latest pricey Sunset Islands deal.\nIn September, waste management mogul Patrick Dovigi\npaid $15 million\nto acquire a waterfront house on the Sunset Islands in an off-market deal. It\u2019s next door to the 11,300-square-foot waterfront mansion he bought for\n$27.5 million\nin April. Between the two properties, his estate now spans 1.2 acres.\nThis summer, ex-Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam sold a waterfront home for\n$21.5 million\n, and disgraced luxury broker Oren Alexander sold his waterfront mansion for\n$51.5 million\n.\n",

        "content": "FlightWave Aerospace Systems is taking flight with its latest lease in the Los Angeles area.\nThe subsidiary of drone technology company Red Cat Holdings, signed a five-year lease for 51,023 square feet of space at a creative industrial and office property in Torrance, Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The deal is purportedly valued at almost $5.4 million. The facility at 2660 Columbia Street is owned by Chicago-based\nFirst Industrial Realty Trust\n.\nWith the new lease, FlightWave will more than triple its office footprint. The company currently operates out of a 14,616-square-foot space at Carson Industrial Center in Carson. FlightWave signed a three-year lease agreement at the DWS Group-owned property in late March, though it quickly outgrew the space. The company plans to sublease its Carson offices after setting up shop in Torrance.\nOf the 51,023 square feet of industrial space at the new Torrance facility, 12,079 square feet are refurbished offices. The property has a clear height of 20 feet with four dock-high positions, an early suppression-fast response sprinkler system and 75 on-site parking spaces.\n\nFlightWave\u2019s new home is in a fitting location, as the aerospace industry has deep roots in the South Bay dating back to the World War II era. It still remains popular for aerospace companies today; the\nBill Gates\n-backed Heart Aerospace, for example, signed a lease for 30,000 square feet at 1830 West 205th Street in Torrance last month. And in March, aerospace and aviation industry manufacturer\nTrio Manufacturing tripled its footprint\nto more than 123,000 square feet at a facility in Gardena.\nIn Torrance, besides Heart Aerospace, FlightWave will join Honeywell Aerospace at 2525 West 190th Street, Cadence Aerospace at 22906 Frampton Avenue, and In Orbit Aerospace at 20600 Gramercy Place. Several companies are also clustered around Zamperini Field, formerly known as the Torrance Municipal Airport, including Howmet Aerospace, Lisi Aerospace and Microcosm.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The duo reportedly spent the flight discussing ways the deal could collapse and what they could do to save it in such a case, with Witkoff doing direct negotiating over the phone while Kushner would draft up plans.\n\u201cThe experience that Steve and\u2004I have as\u2004deal\u2004guys is that\u2004you have to understand people,\u201d Kushner added. \u201cYou have to be able to kind of\u2004get the bottom line\u2004out of them, and then\u2004see who\u2004do you think is\u2004playing games, and how much\u2004room\u2004do you have to push things?\u201d\n\u201cA lot of the people who do this are history professors, because they have a lot of experience, or diplomats,\u201d Kushner said. \u201cIt\u2019s just different being deal guys \u2014 just a different sport.\u201d\n\nKushner and Witkoff\u2019s roles in the discussions have drawn criticism from some who view their role as being personally rather than politically driven.\nAlong with their personal ties to Trump are potentially huge business gains.\nAffinity Partners,\nKushner\u2019s private equity firm, has raised billions\nfrom wealth funds in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\n\u201cIn order for the next stage of this agreement to be successful, Jared Kushner needs to stop approaching this issue as a real estate deal and start focusing on political and human rights,\u201d said Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland.\nThe deal marks the second ceasefire agreement in the region signed this year, the first being in January shortly before Trump took office. Israel reportedly violated that agreement more than 1,000 times, leading to the collapse of that ceasefire in March, according to a\nletter\nsent to the United Nations from Riyad Mansour, the State of Palestine\u2019s Permanent Observer in the body. In the hours since the new agreement was announced, Israel has\nreportedly\nnot ceased its bombing campaign.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Verizon is the latest corporate heavyweight to shed office space in the Chicago suburbs, even as it commits to staying put for the long haul.\nThe telecommunications company renewed its lease at the Continental Towers in\nRolling Meadows\n, cutting its footprint by about 20 percent to 128,900 square feet, according to Transwestern, which handles leasing for the property. The deal extends Verizon\u2019s stay at 1701 Golf Road through April 2036 and reduces its space from nearly 160,000 square feet, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. CBRE\u2019s Jon Springer and Andrew Kaplan represented Verizon in the lease extension.\nThe renewal offers a lifeline for Continental Towers, a four-building, 911,000-square-foot complex that\u2019s been mired in\nforeclosure\nfor more than two years. Its ownership venture \u2014 Rubenstein Partners of Philadelphia and Chicago-based Glenstar \u2014 was sued in 2023 over an alleged default on an $85 million loan tied to the property.\nThe debt, now controlled by Miami-based special servicer Rialto Capital on behalf of CMBS investors, has since been a test case for suburban office workouts.\nRialto\u2019s deal with\nVerizon\nhelps steady cash flow for the complex, which was only 53 percent leased as of July, well below the suburban average of about 68 percent, according to court filings.\n\n\u201cThis extension is a good indication that a Class A property with stellar amenities and convenient access can draw and retain high-quality tenants,\u201d said Transwestern\u2019s Joe Stevens, who represented ownership in the transaction. Stevens and Steve Degodny handle leasing for the building.\nContinental Towers has faced a turbulent stretch in recent years.\nWhen Rubenstein and Glenstar paid $122 million for it in 2018, the property was nearly 90 percent leased. Soon after, major tenants including Komatsu and Panasonic exited more than 150,000 square feet combined, and the pandemic slowed backfilling efforts.\nOwnership has since poured $28.5 million into upgrades, from lobby renovations to tenant amenities.\nVerizon\n, which has anchored the complex since 2016, is its largest tenant.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

That\u2019s $2,364 for the 11,000-square-foot home. The manse was originally listed in 2023 for $32 million.\nThe asking price is more than eight times what Willenborg and his wife, Barbara, paid for the home nearly four decades ago.

In March, the Jewett House at 2990 Broadway, a block away from Willenborg\u2019s home, sold for $26.5 million. The onetime\nSan Francisco Decorator Showcase home\nat 3701 Washington Street also sold off-market for $26 million.\n\nThe home at 2898 Broadway was completed in 1899 and designed by architect Walter D.

The property is owned by an affiliate of China-based Z&L; that entity filed for bankruptcy in July to stave off the foreclosure seizure.\nOn Oct. 2, a federal judge cleared the way to proceed by issuing an order that would effectively terminate the bankruptcy case and allow the lender to proceed with the foreclosure and seizure. That same day, the Z&amp;L affiliate filed a lawsuit to block the foreclosure, alleging wrongful foreclosure and unfair business practices among other claims.\nThe suit claims that about a year ago, the lender proposed a way for the Z&amp;L affiliate to reorganize financing for the property, albeit primarily via a loan with a 10 percent interest rate, higher than the 8 percent rate on the delinquent loan.\n\u201cThe October 2024 renewal was not a real workout,\u201d the Z&amp;L affiliate said in a court filing. \u201cIt was a foreclosure trap.\u201d\nThe Z&amp;L affiliate is already approved to develop about 700 housing units on the former Greyhound station site, though the developer never broke ground on the project. Because so much time has passed, the permits for the site have expired, so a developer would have to start the planning process over from square one.\n\nStill, both the Z&amp;L affiliate and the lending group haven\u2019t given up hope on building, as they\u2019ve both stated in court filings that they have new plans to develop housing at the site.\nIt\u2019s the latest chapter in a series of real estate scandals in San Jose tied to Z&amp;L Properties and its affiliates.\nA Z&amp;L-owned historic church at 43 East Saint James Street in downtown San Jose, for example, has drawn complaints for its dilapidated state. In June, Machine Investment Group bought a two-tower residential complex at 188 West Saint James Street in a foreclosure proceeding that took ownership of the property from a Z&amp;L affiliate.\nNearly all of Z&amp;L\u2019s real estate empire in San Jose\nhas fallen apart\nthrough deeply discounted property sales or foreclosure proceedings, and the Greyhound station appears to be part of its last stand.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The legal fallout from DJE Texas Management Group\u2019s collapse keeps widening.\nDenver-based Platte Canyon Capital filed a new lawsuit against the multifamily syndicator\u2019s former chief, Devin Elder, accusing him of fraud and breach of contract tied to the July sale of a San Antonio apartment complex, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n.\nPlatte\u2019s suit seeks more than $1 million in damages and accuses Elder of effectively stealing $52,000 in rent from the property after the sale, records from Bexar County\u2019s 37th Civil District Court show. The complaint centers on the 268-unit\nAllure Apartments\nat 7770 Pipers Lane, one of several DJE assets unloaded this summer amid the firm\u2019s unraveling. Platte claims Elder and his affiliates, including\nDJE Properties\nand 7770 Pipers LLC, misrepresented the building\u2019s occupancy rate and financial health leading up to the sale.\nDJE allegedly told Platte the complex was more than 90 percent leased, with tenants lined up to fill remaining vacancies, according to the Oct. 6 petition. But once Platte took over, it found that numerous tenants were delinquent or had stopped paying rent altogether \u2014 and that DJE hadn\u2019t filed any evictions or taken steps to address the arrears, the lawsuit alleges.\nThe actual occupancy rate, Platte contends, was about 15 percent lower than DJE represented.\nOn top of that, the lawsuit accuses DJE of continuing to collect rent for two months after closing, taking in more than $52,000 through its online payment portal in violation of the sales agreement. Elder has not returned the money, Platte alleges.\n\n\u201cElder\u2019s communications convey not refusal, but inability, to return what is in effect stolen rent,\u201d Platte\u2019s attorney David Denton wrote. \u201cPlatte construes the inability to pay to mean that the money is already disbursed and gone \u2014 especially given the backdrop of lawsuits, investigations and investor demands.\u201d\nThe sale was financed with an $18.2 million loan from Prime Finance Partners, though the full transaction terms weren\u2019t disclosed. Platte and its attorney declined to comment. Elder, his counsel and broker Newmark did not respond to requests for comment from the outlet.\nElder and DJE\u2019s pile of legal and regulatory troubles has grown since February, when communications to investors abruptly stopped. Multiple investor lawsuits are pending, and the FBI is investigating DJE for alleged money laundering and wire fraud.\nIn August, federal investigators opened a\ncriminal probe\ninto Elder\u2019s DJE Texas Management Group, following a June warrant to seize DJE properties, including over 1,000 acres of land tied to Elder\u2019s\nDJE portfolio across six counties\nin South Texas.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "pub_date_dt": "2025-10-10T11:30:00",
        "content": "Zohran Mamdani has been criticized for fantastical proposals, including free day care, free buses, a $70 billion bond issue, a $30-an-hour minimum wage and 200,000 union-built homes built for $500,000 apiece.\nCampaign platforms might be irresponsible or even dishonest, but \u201cwhatever works\u201d has become an accepted strategy \u2014 one that seems to have helped Mamdani, who leads his main competition in the mayoral election, Andrew Cuomo, by 13 points in the latest poll (more on that below).\nCuomo seems to have gotten the message. At a\nCrain\u2019s mayoral forum\non Wednesday, the former governor said: \u201cThe big project has to be 500,000 units of affordable housing on 300 sites\nsimultaneously\n. I think that\u2019s the first big project.\u201d\nThat makes Mamdani\u2019s pie-in-the-sky ideas seem mundane.\nCuomo\u2019s\ninitial housing plan\nwas to build or preserve 500,000 units over 10 years. Now he\u2019s saying build (forget preserving) 500,000 all at once. And not just any units \u2014 affordable ones. Those require subsidies.\nThe number of 1,000-unit projects being built in the city at any given time is in the single digits. To say we should attack the housing crisis by building 300 of them at once is like saying\nDaenerys Targaryen\nshould have conquered the Seven Kingdoms by hatching 300 dragons instead of three. (Yes, I miss \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d)\nEven if Cuomo could find 300 sites for projects averaging 1,667 affordable units, and the money to finance them, I don\u2019t think there would be enough tower cranes to build them. Or tower crane operators, for that matter.\nGetting licensed as a tower crane operator in the city typically requires getting into the International Union of Operating Engineers\u2019 training program. As mayor, Mike Bloomberg tried to break the\nunion\u2019s stranglehold\non the process, a fight that Bill de Blasio\ncontinued\n. (For this and other reasons, tower crane operators are in high demand and can earn hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.)\nI cannot think of a single element of Cuomo\u2019s statement that is even remotely feasible. The least absurd one would be finding 300 sites for big developments. But that would require buying or condemning (by eminent domain) a lot of private property, which alone would take years. This is so not happening.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nOffice sublet queen Ruth Colp-Haber wrote in her entertaining newsletter that 1,000-unit projects \u201chere and there\u201d are nice but not enough to meet demand, so the next mayor should launch a competition for architects and developers to pitch \u201cvisionary new projects and even new neighborhoods.\u201d\nBig housing ideas have been floated: Comptroller Brad Lander suggested developing on four city golf courses. Mike Bloomberg called for dredging the harbor and using fill to extend the Lower East Side into the water. Bill de Blasio wanted to deck over Sunnyside Yard. Mayor Eric Adams swapped land to the Port Authority to do a $3.5 billion\nBrooklyn Marine Terminal development\nthat promises 6,000 homes.\nWhat\u2019s your big housing idea? Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\n\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The 467m office-to-residential conversion incentive doesn\u2019t require \u201cfamily-size\u201d units, unlike many other politically driven programs. That flexibility is good: New York City has many childless adults and couples doing the roommate thing because small units are in short supply.\nAlso, office conversions create tricky layouts not conducive to multiple bedrooms. Marty Burger and Andrew Heiberger\u2019s conversion of\n29 West 35th Street\nwill be all studios, and\n5 Times Square\nby RXR, SL Green and Apollo will be 1,050 studios and 200 one-bedrooms.\nElsewhere\u2026\nA\nQuinnipiac poll\nreleased Thursday \u2014 Quinnipiac\u2019s first since a Sept. 10 poll in which Adams was at 12 percent \u2014 found Cuomo\u2019s support grew by 10 points and Mamdani\u2019s by 1 point. This suggests that nearly all Adams voters moved to Cuomo, who still trails Mamdani 46 percent to 33 percent.\nThe poll also found 48 percent of likely voters felt Mamdani would do the best job of lowering housing costs, and 25 percent said Cuomo would. That was the only issue on which Mamdani bested his top-line 46 percent number. He did worse on managing the schools (41 percent), public safety (35 percent) and growing the economy (35 percent).\nQuinnipiac also asked likely voters which candidate\u2019s views were closest to their own on the Israel-Hamas conflict. Forty-one percent said Mamdani and 26 percent said Cuomo. That might come as a shock to members of the real estate industry who consider Mamdani\u2019s position on Israel to be disqualifying.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$8.4 million\nfor a 3,162-square-foot condominium unit at 104 Wooster Street in Soho. Danny Davis, Lisa Balbuena and Lisa Davis of the Corcoran Group had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$25 million\nfor a 71,180-square-foot office building. Marty Burger and Andrew Heiberger\nplan to convert\nthe property to 107 studio apartments.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$42 million\nfor a 5,000-square-foot co-op at 55 Central Park West. The Nickman O\u2019Neal Team at Douglas Elliman has the listing.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "Jeff Krasnoff\u2019s securitized debt heavyweight\nRialto Capital\nsnagged control of a distressed\nRosemont\noffice property, helping to wrap up one of the Chicago area\u2019s most severe suburban office meltdowns.\nThe Miami-based special servicer for mortgage debt tied to the nine-story\nColumbia Center III property\nat 9525 West Bryn Mawr Avenue took over the building from Adventus Realty Trust in late September through a deed in lieu of foreclosure, resolving a yearslong lawsuit over a $29 million loan default, public records show.\nThe transfer marks the latest twist in a downward spiral for Adventus, the once-aggressive Canadian investor whose U.S. office portfolio has been in freefall since its 2023 bankruptcy. Adventus leadership didn\u2019t return a request for comment, and Rialto declined to comment.\nRialto\u2019s takeover also highlights how deeply the property\u2019s distress had begun to weigh on the lender\u2019s own books. Columbia Center III \u2014 which is in a three-building complex spanning 620,000 square feet \u2014 produced just $4.7 million in revenue last year while expenses topped $5 million, including $1.7 million in debt service, according to loan data.\nEarlier this year, the property was appraised at just $11.7 million, loan data shows, down bigtime from $41 million back in 2014, when its $29 million loan was originated by JP Morgan and then packaged up with other commercial property debts and sold off to investors.\nThe imbalance mirrored the broader dysfunction inside Adventus\u2019 debt web. A letter filed Sept. 26 in New York U.S. District Court sheds light on the messy unwinding.\n\nThat lawsuit regards a separate\n$350 million CMBS debt pool\nwith an adjustable interest rate that\u2019s tied to Adventus-owned office properties that have drawn loan defaults, including the other two Columbia Center buildings and more in Illinois and Georgia. Attorneys for the bondholders of the property loans in that case told Judge Margaret Garnett that the parties had reached a \u201csettlement in principle\u201d covering multiple distressed assets \u2014 but that the \u201ccomplex deed-in-lieu agreements\u201d and receivership logistics had slowed final execution.\nFive of Adventus\u2019 Georgia properties had already been seized via nonjudicial foreclosures, the letter said, while deed-in-lieu transfers for three more \u2014 including the Columbia Centre I and II offices in Rosemont as well The Crossings in suburban Chicago\u2019s Oak Brook and Cantera Meadows in Warrenville \u2014 were \u201csubstantially final.\u201d\nDuring the origination of the $350 million loan a little more than four years ago, the properties used as collateral included five in the Atlanta area and three in the Chicago area, with the two Columbia Center buildings, Cantera Meadows and The Crossings also getting wrapped into the deal. The buildings were appraised at $439 million at the time, but were valued at $47.8 million in November, according to loan data.\nThe court document confirms that Adventus\u2019 unraveling extended far beyond Chicago. Its multi-state office portfolio, once touted as a stable income play, instead triggered litigation in multiple jurisdictions.\nNow Rialto must decide whether to hold, sell or reposition the Rosemont asset it just seized. While Rosemont remains one of the better-performing suburban submarkets, even its Class A towers face tough math. As hybrid work and higher interest rates reshape office demand, Rialto\u2019s newest acquisition may prove less a trophy than a test of timing.\n",

That flips the script on Miami\u2019s post-pandemic market, where luxury sales have closed at record levels since the wealth migration started in 2020.\nDubai and New York led luxury markets globally, according to the report. Dubai saw 143 sales with $2.6 billion in dollar volume; and New York closed 120 deals with $2.9 billion in dollar volume. Los Angeles followed with 73 luxury sales with $1.6 billion in dollar volume.\nFor New York, second quarter sales amounted to a 97 percent increase in deal volume, year-over-year, compared to 61 deals in the same period of last year. Dollar volume surged by 184 percent, from $1 billion in the second quarter of last year. The report credited New York\u2019s thriving market to demand for\ntrophy condos\nand\nluxury townhouse resales\n.\nForeign buyers have also been fueling New York City\u2019s market\nthis year.\n\nSouth Florida\u2019s numbers weren\u2019t as sunny.

        "content": "Pacific Palisades residents could be in for relief from\nMeasure ULA\nas Angeles Mayor\nKaren Bass\npresses the City Council to move forward on a temporary pause of the so-called \u201cmansion tax.\u201d\nThe request marks the first major move at the municipal level to adjust the tax\u2019s parameters, and follows months of talk about ULA\u2019s impact on the Palisades post-wildfires real estate market. An announcement of the request by the mayor\u2019s office indicated that the pause would not be citywide, providing a \u201cone-time exemption to Measure ULA for Palisade homeowners.\u201d\nMeasure ULA\u2019s two-tiered tax on commercial and residential transactions has loomed large over dealmaking since voters passed the November 2022 ballot measure. It applies a 4 percent tax on deals starting at $5.3 million and 5.5 percent on those $10.6 million or more. It\u2019s been cited as a significant hurdle in the Palisades, a community within the city of Los Angeles, with many agents saying the assessment has stopped deals from happening.\nBass, in a\nletter\nto members of the 15-seat City Council sent on Thursday, requested they pass an ordinance that would give the finance director the authority to enact the limited ULA pause.\nThe move came after Bass met with developer Rick Caruso in his capacity as founder of the nonprofit Steadfast LA, which he established to aid in the rebuilding of the Palisades and Altadena after both areas were hit by wildfires earlier this year.\nThe stirrings of action brought some early cheers from the residential marketplace.\n\u201cPausing the ULA mansion tax is a game changer for Pacific Palisades,\u201d Amalfi Estates founder\nAnthony Marguleas\ntold\nThe Real Deal\nThursday evening. \u201cFamilies rebuilding after the fire need relief, not more financial hurdles.\nMarguleas said the move would \u201chelp unlock much needed inventory for our community.\u201d\nBass proposed the one-time exemption on residential properties only, which would mean single-family homes, condominiums and what she described in her letter to the council as \u201cother residential housing\u201d impacted by the fires.\n\nSuch a move would \u201cspeed up sales of these properties and spur rebuilding and rehabilitation of the Palisades,\u201d Bass said in her letter. \u201cThis will create more housing citywide and generate higher Measure ULA tax revenue when these rebuilt or renovated properties are subsequently sold to new homeowners because those second and subsequent sales will remain subject to Measure ULA.\u201d\nAs it currently exists, Measure ULA \u201cis silent on an issue now affecting our Palisades community,\u201d Bass said of the tax\u2019s cost implications for those trying to recover from the fire.\nIt\u2019s unclear if any moves have been made to place discussion of the ordinance on a future city council meeting agenda. An inquiry to Bass\u2019 office was not immediately returned Thursday evening.\nFirst crack\nWhile Bass\u2019 proposal is temporary, if passed, it would be the first crack in an armor that\u2019s shielded ULA from exemptions or other changes since the ballot measure was passed and went into effect in 2023.\nLawsuits and a new ballot measure to have the tax repealed have routinely drawn the ire of housing and homeless advocates whose vocal responses have so far helped create a fortress around adjustments to the tax.\nBass\u2019 proposal hits at a criticism some have had for the tax in its unilateral application to real estate transactions \u2014 both commercial and residential \u2014 without taking into account realities such as if a home sells at a loss or what happens in the case of a natural disaster.\nBeyond residential, the tax has affected commercial transactions and land deals as it\u2019s viewed as another layer of cost making it harder to get deals to pencil out.\n\u201cThere are no parameters and no boundaries on the measure,\u201d Beverly Hills Estates co-founder and CEO\nRayni Williams\ntold\nTRD\nlast month in discussing the tax. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that [addresses] if you\u2019re taking a loss on a sale or if it\u2019s an inherited property. At least capital gains [tax] has parameters.\u201d\n",

The property sits a few blocks southwest of the Expo/Bundy Metro station, and as a result, would benefit from\nTransit Oriented Development\nincentives.\nThe project proposal calls for the construction of 42 studio, one- and three-bedroom apartments and parking for five vehicles on the site. To help make it happen, the developer is requesting entitlements including Transit Oriented Incentive Area development bonuses, which would allow the developer to build a larger structure than zoning rules would otherwise allow.\nIn exchange for the larger-sized development, nine of the apartments are to be set aside as affordable housing for low-income residents. The \u201clow-income\u201d in Los Angeles County is currently\nset\nat an annual income of $84,850 or less for one person.\nKevin Tsai Architecture is designing the building. When complete, it will feature a rooftop deck and a backyard for residents to use.\n\nThe project site is adjacent to the location of another Terra Capital project also designed by Kevin Tsai Architecture. The two firms are planning to build a fully affordable housing project at 2215 South Wellesley Avenue, a planned seven-story building with 82 studio, one-, and three-bedroom apartments. The companies are also planning a 54-unit development at 2478 South Purdue Avenue, also in\nSawtelle\n.\nThe area to the south of the Expo/Bundy station has seen a number of developments spring up after being rezoned from single-family use to clear the way for multifamily development as part of the Expo Transit Corridor neighborhood plan. Carmel Partners, for example, has already taken advantage of the new zoning regulations to\nbuild projects in Sawtelle\nto the tune of more than 600 units combined.\nThe 2219 South Wellesley project is expected to be completed in 2028.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Cirrus Real Estate Partners didn\u2019t just swoop in\nto take over Greenland USA\u2019s troubled Brooklyn project: It also bought up most of the firm\u2019s debt in the U.S.\nCirrus\u2019 Joseph McDonnell on Thursday said that his company purchased a majority of the outstanding debt held by\nthe struggling Greenland\n, which is a subsidiary of Shanghai-based conglomerate Greenland Group.\nHe said that debt was valued at $200 million, excluding the more than $300 million tied to Pacific Park.\nDuring a public meeting on Thursday, McDonnell provided some more details on how Cirrus restructured Pacific Park,\na long-delayed development in Prospect Heights\nthat was supposed to deliver 6,400 apartments, of which 2,250 would be affordable. Under a 2014 agreement, developer Greenland was supposed to finish the affordable units \u2014\u00a0of which 876 have gone unbuilt \u2014 by May 31, 2025.\nThis week, the state approved a joint venture led by Cirrus and LCOR to\ntake over the sites\n. Through a foreclosure auction, six rail yard sites were transferred to the team. Through a separate deal, the joint venture also took over a site near the Barclays Center, referred to as site 5, and development rights tied to a public plaza in front of the arena. Greenland previously planned to transfer those rights to build a larger project at site 5.\nThis handoff is a long time coming. In 2022, Greenland\ndefaulted\non $350 million tied to the rail yard sites from Nick Mastroianni\u2019s USIF, which raised the capital through the cash-for-visas EB-5 program. Fortress Investment Group also owned a stake in the debt. Greenland, USIF and Fortress are part of the new joint venture, but will not have a role in the day-to-day management of the project.\nCirrus paid outstanding bills to architects, engineers and others who have worked on the project and took care of other liabilities, according to McDonnell. Some of those bills were paid in the form of new debt issued by Cirrus. As part of the new arrangement, USIF and Fortress took a deferred interest in repayment of new debt on the project, discounted for their stake in the new joint venture and subordinated to Cirrus and LCOR.\nGreenland has already invested $950 million in the project.\nChanging hands to forge ahead\nMcDonnell said Cirrus\u2019 takeover of all of Greenland\u2019s U.S. debt provided leverage to come to an agreement on how to move forward at Pacific Park.\n\u201cThis project, as everybody knows, has been stuck for a period of time. It was carrying a debt load which was unsustainable even when rates were lower,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough the leverage we had over those three counterparties, Greenland, USIF and Fortress, we came in to clean up the structure so that it can hopefully move forward at a quicker pace.\u201d\nGreenland\nbought a 70 percent stake in Pacific Park, previously Atlantic Yards, in 2013, eventually taking another 25 percent as the previous developer, Forest City Realty Trust, backed away from development and eventually\nsold\nits assets to Brookfield Asset Management.\nThe firm was then hit by economic challenges, including China\u2019s slowing economy and the government\u2019s\nscramble\nto pull back on its U.S. investments and save developers who took on excessive debt. Then the pandemic hit, and interest rates soared. Greenland began trying to sell off its California assets, including its trophy apartment tower in Los Angeles known as Metropolis, which it sold at a\n$200 million\nloss in late 2022.\nAdditional details on Greenland\u2019s other debt taken over by Cirrus were not immediately available.\n\nMcDonnell and Anthony Tortora, co-chief investment officer and principal at LCOR, gave a brief overview of their companies at Thursday\u2019s meeting, held by the Atlantic Yards Community Development Corporation, a subsidiary of Empire State Development that reviews and makes recommendations on the project.\nMcDonnell repeatedly said the development team is not \u201ccondo-focused,\u201d and that Cirrus is dedicated to \u201cmaking a dent in the housing crisis\u201d by building housing accessible to a range of incomes. He noted that \u201cit is a lot easier\u201d to make the development work with condos, so the team expects public investment alongside private money. The developers didn\u2019t provide any information on how they will seek to change plans for the sites.\nMembers of the Atlantic Yards Community Development Corporation raised concerns about the project\u2019s timeline, given that the platforms over the rail yards between Pacific Street and Atlantic Avenue could alone take years to construct. That, along with the time it will take for an environmental review and for a new plan to be approved, could mean construction of buildings won\u2019t begin until after 2030.\nSome also asked how the platforms over the rail yards will be financed, and raised the possibility of implementing a similar arrangement to Hudson Yards. There, Related Companies is using $2 billion worth of payments in lieu of taxes to pay for a platform over train tracks on Manhattan\u2019s West Side.\nThe developers didn\u2019t specify how much public subsidies it is hoping will help finance the housing and platforms, but indicated that it is looking at a number of city and state programs.\n\u201cThe current plan for the rail yards predates the iPhone,\u201d Tortora said. \u201cWe think there\u2019s an opportunity to optimize the plan, bring it current, which will facilitate the delivery of more housing, more affordability.\u201d\nChanges to the project will require amendments to the state\u2019s general project plan, a method outside the city\u2019s land use process that lays out the parameters of the development. The state expects to begin a public engagement process in November.\nAs part of its agreement with the state, the developers will pay $12 million, in installments, to a fund that will finance affordable housing in the neighboring communities. The payment comes\nafter ESD halted fines\nthat were intended to kick in when Greenland missed the May 2025 deadline. Missing that deadline was supposed to result in fines of $2,000 per month per unfinished affordable housing unit \u2014 a sum that would ultimately be far greater than the $12 million.\nIf the developers do not sign a memorandum of understanding outlining the new project by July 31, 2026, the state could impose the 2014 fines.\nMichelle de la Uz, executive director of the Fifth Avenue Committee, which is a member of BrooklynSpeaks, a coalition that was party to the 2014 agreement, said $12 million is not sufficient to make up for the level of displacement seen in the surrounding neighborhoods as residents waited for this housing to be delivered. She said she doesn\u2019t believe ESD has not always acted in the best interest of the public.\n\u201cThis is a long time coming. We\u2019re at a critical moment, and there\u2019s obviously decades of distrust and skepticism that need to be overcome,\u201d she said, noting that she was referring both to the developers and ESD.\nIn an interview this week, Assembly member Jo Anne Simon expressed the need to establish that the project is feasible after multiple developers have been unable to deliver.\n\u201cMy concerns are, we\u2019ve gone a long time without this housing,\u201d she said. \u201cHow can we have any faith in what is being done here?\u201d\n",

In addition to residences and commercial space, the project would include 2 acres of public open space on the street level.\nThe City Planning Commission unanimously voted to recommend approval of Fourth &amp; Central.\n\u201cThis project represents a significant stride toward addressing the region\u2019s housing challenges,\u201d Nella McOsker, president and CEO of DTLA advocacy organization Central City Association, said at the meeting. \u201cPlus, the new retail and restaurant space will attract business and people to Downtown.\u201d\nHousing construction in Los Angeles has\nplunged\nsince early last year, nearing a 10-year low.\n\nFourth &amp; Central accounts for the biggest chunk of units in the\ncurrent pipeline\nof nearly 30,000 units on the drawing board for the downtown area.\nThe development,\nannounced by Denver-based Continuum\nin 2021\n, would raze a 130-year-old cold storage warehouse next to the Arts District and Little Tokyo. Continuum formed a partnership with the property owner, Los Angeles Cold Storage, to develop the site.\u00a0Continuum is no longer involved in the project, a spokesperson for L.A.

        "content": "A federal judge dismissed a\nlawsuit filed by a group of Winnetka homeowners\nagainst the village over new regulations on lakefront construction, dealing a temporary blow in the legal battle over the contentious ordinance.\nThe homeowners brought the lawsuit in May 2024 in response to a Winnetka ordinance that restricts constructions on the bluffs along the lakefront. The ordinance creates a setback limiting development from the toe of the property\u2019s bluff or 50 feet from Lake Michigan\u2019s high water mark, whichever is farther from the high water mark.\nThe lawsuit, joined by more than a dozen homeowners, argued that Winnetka\u2019s ordinance amounted to an unconstitutional taking of their property without compensation. They argued the ordinance may reduce property values \u201cin the hundreds of millions of dollars\u201d cumulatively along the lakefront.\nU.S. District Judge LaShonda Hunt ruled Oct. 3 that it was too early for the homeowners to claim damage from the ordinance. The judge said that because none of the plaintiffs had submitted development plans or been denied permits under the new rules, the court could not determine if any harm had actually occurred. Two other counts in the lawsuit alleged violations of the Illinois Constitution, but the judge ruled only on the federal claim.\n\u201cThe village is pleased that the court granted the village\u2019s motion to dismiss the only federal claim in the complaint,\u201d Peter Friedman, Winnetka\u2019s village attorney, said in a email.\nThe plaintiffs have until Oct. 30 to file a new complaint in response to the judge\u2019s ruling. An attorney for the homeowners did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nJena Radnay\n, a broker with @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate who deals in multimillion-dollar lakefront homes, said she expects the homeowners to file an amended complaint to keep the lawsuit going.\nRadnay told\nThe Real Deal\nshe knows at least six lakefront homeowners who have considered selling but are worried their home\nvalues could fall by millions of dollars\napiece because they don\u2019t have modernized amenities in the areas that they\u2019re now restricted from building in. Houses with such features, like pools, recreational facilities and stunning waterfront viewing rooms, are what buyers are after in the North Shore power town, Radnay said.\n\n\u201cThere is a whole silent slew of lakefront owners sitting back waiting to see what the lawsuit is going to do,\u201d Radnay said, adding she fears there could be cuts by as much as 30 to 40 percent at some properties.\nEven though Winnetka\u2019s lakefront homes reached unprecedented values for Illinois this year, as Radnay recently brokered the\n$31 million waterfront sale\nof a former Goldman Sachs executive\u2019s house, that\u2019s only because such properties had been recently updated and \u201coptimized\u201d before the ordinance took effect, she said.\nPlus, the sellers of the record-breaking deal this year spent far more assembling the land on which their property sits and improving it over the years, with their investment in the home likely exceeding $60 million.\nThe village has maintained that the regulations are necessary to protect the bluffs from erosion and are in the interest of public safety. The ordinance was passed unanimously in February following heated public meetings.\nThe passage of the ordinance, along with a separate ordinance from December limiting lot consolidation, was largely in\nreaction to billionaire Justin Ishbia\u2019s sprawling construction\nproject in the village. In 2023, Ishbia pieced together multiple properties in order to create a 68,300-square-foot megamansion. The properties and construction cost $78 million.\nIshbia\u2019s project included removal of greenery and destruction of the lakefront bluffs, which caused controversy in the village and prompted the new restrictions on lakefront constructions.\nOther North Shore towns with high-end lakefront property have long had restrictions on development along the lakeshore bluffs. Highland Park and Evanston require 40-foot setbacks from the property\u2019s bluff, while Kenilworth requires a 35-foot setback and Glencoe\u2019s requires setbacks on a case-by-case basis. Lake Forest requires a 75-foot setback from bluffs.\n",

Immigration and Customs Enforcement has long run a processing center in Broadview, a west suburban site that\u2019s become a flashpoint between agents and protesters.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doubling down, and we\u2019re going to be in more parts of Chicago,\u201d Noem said during a cabinet meeting. \u201cWhat they\u2019re trying to do with these riots and violence is distract us and keep us from going after those murderers and rapists that are out in the streets.\u201d\nThe comments followed Noem\u2019s visit to Broadview last week, where she told ICE and Border Patrol agents she wanted to buy a nearby building. The Broadview location has served as the command center for Chicagoland\noperations\n.\nConservative influencers embedded with the administration\u2019s deportation\ncampaign\nlater posted videos of Noem and officials touring vacant warehouses across the metro area as potential ICE sites. It\u2019s unclear which facilities DHS is pursuing or whether purchases are imminent.\nThe real estate push adds a new layer to the federal government\u2019s growing physical presence in and around Chicago. The\nSun-Times\nreported National Guard troops began arriving outside the city this week, including at the Broadview facility, while courts weigh the legality of the deployment.\nThe agency also ramped up security spending recently. Noem said DHS is \u201chardening all of our buildings\u201d in response to a September shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas, adding that measures could include rooftop snipers and expanded protective teams.\n\nDHS did not respond to questions from\nCrain\u2019s\nabout where or how it plans to expand. But any purchases could ripple through the region\u2019s industrial and office markets, where\nfederal tenants\noften pay top dollar and can alter local property dynamics overnight, leaving little room for\nlegal recourse\n. It was also unclear why DHS is considering purchasing locales rather than renting space.\nMeanwhile, the federal government said in March it plans to cancel leases and shut down Chicago offices for Health and Human Services and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Los Altos Hills officials might be having some buyer\u2019s remorse about allowing housing in the tony enclave.\nThe town council is looking to reduce the size of a multifamily development, which includes the municipality\u2019s first affordable housing, after voting in 2023 to legalize apartments at Twin Oaks Court, Cal Matters\nreported\n. The vote came out of a need to meet state-mandated housing requirements of 489 new units by the end of the decade as part of the town\u2019s housing element.\nNow, the proposed Twin Oaks Court development could be shaved down in size. Developer Twin Oaks Court LLC filed a preliminary application for a 598-unit project there, hoping to take advantage of state density bonuses by including 56 units for affordable housing. Residents revolted, however, and the council is looking to cut the site\u2019s capacity to 92 units total.\n\u201cThis is exactly what we\u2019ve been asking you to protect us from,\u201d resident Martha Bowden told officials. \u201cThis would be a disaster.\u201d\nThe idea of squeezing in hundreds of people on a small cul-de-sac next to I-280 was \u201ctotally inappropriate,\u201d according to resident Michael Grady, who created a petition for the town to reconsider its original plan for the site.\n\u201cThis is illustrative of exactly why I\u2019ve been saying for over a year and a half that the housing element as drafted is a time bomb,\u201d Grady said.\nLos Altos Hills wouldn\u2019t be alone in its pursuit. Other wealthy enclaves like Carmel and South Pasadena have moved to tweak state-approved housing plans, often citing \u201ccalculation errors\u201d or resident backlash. In Sausalito, officials successfully reduced densities on a contested condo site, while Rancho Palos Verdes tried the same before backing off under legal pressure.\n\n\u201cLocal agencies should not be allowed to amend their housing elements the moment that they are confronted with a real housing development project,\u201d the California Housing Defense Fund, wrote in a\nletter\nto the California Department of Housing and Community Development on Los Altos Hills.\nGovernor Gavis Newsom has also stood fast behind the\nstate\u2019s mandated goals\nin the housing element.\nSome residents, though, are on board with the plan to keep as many units as possible at the site.\n\u201cAfter the housing element was accepted, residents and the council were wailing, \u2018But it\u2019s steep at Twin Oaks,\u2019\u201d Anne Paulson, a member of the Los Altos Affordable Housing Alliance, said. \u201cThey nevertheless chose those sites, instead of flatter sites down the hill. They shouldn\u2019t get to weasel out of what they promised on the basis that they just noticed steep land is steep.\u201d\nThe fight over the Twin Oaks project\u2019s size is indicative of the larger long-running issue of state versus local control in housing development. \u201cWe\u2019re in the testing-the-waters phase,\u201d Matt Gelfand of Californians for Homeownership said. \u201cIf some smaller cities can get away with it, others will follow.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Midtown Capital Partners advanced its plan to build 300 apartments, including 60 affordable housing units, on a parking lot at a Plantation office park, under the state\u2019s Live Local Act.\nThe Plantation City Council on Wednesday unanimously approved a site plan for the six-story multifamily development on a parking lot that has an industrial land use designation and is zoned for light industrial operations.\nThe 7.9-acre development site at 7510 West Sunrise Boulevard is an under-utilized parking lot at the\nPlantation Pointe office park\n, where entertainment technology company\nMagic Leap\nand pet supplies retailer Chewy have their headquarters.\n\u201cThe location is a parking lot that is seldom used. If you drive by there, on most occasions, you\u2019ll notice that it\u2019s vacant,\u201d Dan Holmes, Plantation\u2019s director of planning, zoning and economic development, said at the city council meeting.\nMiami-based Midtown Capital Partners, led by CEO and managing partner Alejandro Velez, bought the parking lot as part of its\n$56.6 million\nacquisition in 2017 of multiple properties at Plantation Pointe, including two buildings at 7600 and 7700 West Sunrise Boulevard that span about 221,000 square feet.\nThe 60 rent-restricted affordable housing units that Midtown Capital plans to build will include 10 studios, 23 apartments with one bedroom, 21 with two bedrooms and six with three bedrooms.\n\nThose 60 apartments, which equate to 20 percent of the 300 planned apartments at\nPlantation Pointe\n, will remain affordable housing units for 20 years under a declaration of restrictive deed covenants that Midtown Capital agreed to execute.\nUnder the Live Local Act, if a developer chooses to designate at least 40 percent of planned dwellings as affordable housing, the project is subject only to administrative municipal approval and bypasses a local government\u2019s review in a public hearing.\nIf at least 10 percent of the dwellings are designated as affordable housing, the state law gives local governments the option to hold a public hearing to review the project.\n\u201cIn this case, the applicant [Midtown Capital] is requesting to provide 20 percent of the units as affordable,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cUnder the Live Local Act, they\u2019re asking to bypass \u2026 rezoning and land use [changes]. So, that\u2019s something the city council has the discretion to do or not.\u201d\nPlantation\nCity Council member Jennifer Andreu unsuccessfully proposed a declaration of restrictive covenants under which 60 of Midtown Capital\u2019s planned apartments would remain affordable housing units for 30 years instead of 20 years.\n\u201cI feel 20 [years] is a reasonable request,\u201d said Timothy J. Fadgen, another member of the city council, \u201cbecause they are giving us double [the percentage of units] what they\u2019re required to under the Live Local [Act].\u201d",

        "content": "Drawbridge Realty\njust made some notable moves at a three-building office campus in Orange County.\nThe San Francisco-based firm just closed on the acquisition of The Hive office complex in Costa Mesa for $77.9 million, Commercial Observer\nreported\n. Invesco Real Estate was the seller of the 14-acre property at 3333-3337 Susan Street, which includes 3 acres of undeveloped land. Invesco previously paid $84 million for the site in 2018.\nThe same day it closed its purchase of the property, Drawbridge signed a new tenant to lease the entire office campus. Defense contractor Anduril Industries\u2013founded by Palmer Luckey, who also founded Oculus VR and sold it to Facebook for $2 billion in 2014\u2013will be moving into the site after inking a deal for the entirety of the 190,000-square-foot office campus.\nIn \u201csecur[ing] a lease with a strong tenant,\u201d Drawbridge is focusing on its \u201clong-term investment strategy,\u201d company CEO Charlie McEachron said in a\nstatement\n.\n\nThe Hive was built in 2003 and features three two-story buildings, a community courtyard with espresso bar and outdoor lounge, indoor and outdoor conference and workspaces and a fitness center. The offices are minutes away from landmarks like\nSouth Coast Plaza\nand Metro Pointe at South Coast malls and\nJohn Wayne Airport\n.\nEarlier this year, the Costa Mesa City Council considered a proposal from Bay Area-based multifamily developer Legacy to demolish the existing office buildings at The Hive to make way for a new mixed-use development. The project, dubbed\nHive Live\n, would feature 1,050 units of housing, including at least 105 low-income units, as well as 335,958 square feet of open space and 3,692 square feet of retail.\nAnduril, founded in 2017, has been in a growth spurt in recent years. In 2022, the company moved into a\n640,000-square-foot headquarters building\nat The Press, the former printing facility of the Los Angeles Times, at 1375 Sunflower Avenue. That building is next door to The Hive in Costa Mesa. In the past few months alone, Anduril also leased a 163,000-square-foot industrial space in Santa Ana and a nearly 42,000-square-foot office lease in Costa Mesa; the Costa Mesa space is also next to its headquarters.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Los Angeles-based developer Caruso hasn\u2019t built in its hometown for years\u2013and that\u2019s intentional.\nRick Caruso, who runs his namesake company, revealed that strategy on Thursday when he took the stage during Bloomberg\u2019s Screentime conference held at the campus of Nya Studios in Hollywood. Caruso delivered a talk mainly to the Hollywood, media and tech crowd, but nevertheless focused on the city\u2019s issues around affordable housing, taxes and post-wildfire rebuilding.\n\u201cAs a company that takes great pride in being L.A. based, we no longer build within the city of Los Angeles because of the unpredictability, the cost of doing it [and] the multiple layers of bureaucracy you have to go through for approvals,\u201d Caruso said on stage. \u201cAnd I made that decision long before I ever ran for office [in 2022].\u201d\nThe developer of retail centers, including Americana at Brand, The Grove, and\nPalisades Village\n, went on to attribute 40 percent of housing costs to regulations. That includes the permitting process, parking requirements for multifamily, energy efficiency and seismic standards and environmental impact reviews. Since 2023, developers can also tack Measure ULA, a city-specific tax on all property transactions starting at $5.3 million, on the other end of the deal, often making an eventual sale more difficult or less profitable.\n\u201cWhat people need to understand, what leadership needs to understand, is money is going to travel in directions that have the less friction to it, the less risk to it,\u201d Caruso said. \u201cAnd L.A. is redlined now, because of the fires, because of the homeless problem, because of the crime problem. Find a crane in L.A. In 10 years, the lowest amount of housing is now.\u201d\nCaruso delivered a roughly 20-minute talk on stage in which he walked the line between airing out issues in the city from the perspective of a developer and resident, to\ncampaigning\n.\nThat would include what some have viewed as attacks on Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass since January\u2019s Palisades Fire. Wednesday\u2019s release by the fire department of the after-action report for the blaze further fanned critiques around the wildfire response. The long-awaited assessment indicated a number of operational lapses, including communication issues, lack of adequate staffing and water supply problems.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go on the attack; I was honest,\u201d Caruso said when asked about his statements made around the fire. \u201cSome people think I\u2019m attacking Karen Bass. I\u2019m not attacking Karen Bass. I\u2019m saying what the facts are and now we know it. It\u2019s in black and white.\u201d\n\nChatter\nhas continued to mount since January on whether Caruso might make another run for Los Angeles mayor or perhaps a go at California governor. He has repeatedly stated publicly his intent to make a\ndecision\nby the end of the summer.\nWith that deadline now passed, Caruso kicked the can further into the future and said he\u2019ll decide \u201cwhen I decide.\u201d\n\u201cYou know what I\u2019m waiting for? I\u2019m taking this very seriously,\u201d he said at the conference before stating his priority is Steadfast LA and the rebuilding.\nThe nonprofit he launched in February has focused on public-private partnerships aimed at expediting rebuilding in Altadena, Pacific Palisades and Malibu. The group linked early on with prefab home builder and Airbnb spinoff\nSamara\non a program that will give about 100 homes to fire survivors unable to rebuild their homes.\nCaruso\u2019s also been credited with pushing for the use of\nArchistar\n, an artificial intelligence-backed software that is now being used by the city of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County to fast-track permitting. Steadfast, LA Strong Sports and the city of L.A. also partnered to rebuild the Palisades Park and Recreation Center.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a candidate; I want to get this work done,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got time to be a candidate.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The saga over the debt backed by 201 California Street is heading into a new chapter.\nRidge Capital Investors is working to acquire a loan backed by the Financial District property for approximately $75 million, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. That price would value the 17-story, 273,333-square-foot building at about $275 per square foot.\nIf the deal closes, it would end years of questions about the building\u2019s ownership fate. The 201 building is currently owned by\nColumbia Property Trust\n, which is\nlooking to offload the property\nafter defaulting on a $1.7 billion mortgage tied to 201 California and six other buildings in 2023.\nColumbia secured an extension of the loan\u2019s maturity to July of this year with the additional option to extend the maturity into early next year. The firm opted not to use that additional extension and wasn\u2019t able to pay off the loan. By selling the debt to Ridge Capital, Columbia and its lenders can resolve the dispute without extending the loan further.\nMarketing materials for the debt pitched it as \u201ca path to ownership\u201d for the offices. If the deal closes, Columbia could opt to hand over ownership of the building through a deed in lieu of foreclosure.\n\nThe building\u2019s valuation collapse helps paint a picture of the troubles at 201 California. It was appraised at $81.5 million in February, down from $218 million in 2021. Columbia bought the property from Beacon Capital Partners in 2019 for $238.9 million. At the time of the 2019 sale, the building was 99 percent leased; when it hit the market this summer, it was just 35 percent leased.\nSnapping up distressed San Francisco offices is the name of the game for Ridge Capital. In 2023, the firm\nbought 180 Howard Street\nin a $54 million sale-leaseback. Earlier this year, much like what could happen with 201 California, it\nacquired a loan backed by 33 New Montgomery Street\nthrough a similar loan acquisition and deed in lieu of foreclosure process.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "San Antonio\u2019s condo market is starting to crack as condo markets in other Texas metros heat up.\nListings in Alamo City piled up in recent months as buyers retreated, forcing sellers to slash prices and offer perks to move units, according to a new Redfin report. There are 585 active condo listings in the city and just 120 buyers in the hunt, creating a roughly 4-to-1 seller-to-buyer imbalance, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n.\nMonths\u2019 supply of condos sits around six \u2014 the upper edge of what the San Antonio Board of Realtors considers a balanced market. That\u2019s causing many units to linger while sellers struggle to recalibrate.\nTexas cities have already been slower than peers around the country to embrace high-rise living, but the product type is even less popular in San Antonio. A sizable military population favors single-family homes or short-term rentals that can be offloaded easily, leaving condos sidelined, the outlet reported.\nMeanwhile,\nnew construction\nhas swelled supply by about 20 percent, adding lower-priced single-family alternatives to the mix, leaving buyers overwhelmed by local options, Local Redfin agent Jesse Landin told the outlet.\nThe local slowdown mirrors a national pattern.\nRedfin found that in August, there were 72 percent more condo sellers than buyers across the U.S.\u2014 the fifth straight month of oversupply. Rising costs are largely to blame. Homeowners association fees now eat up as much as a quarter of a typical buyer\u2019s monthly budget, while insurance premiums and special assessments for maintenance have climbed sharply since 2020.\nThose costs can kill deals. Landin cited a $250,000 condo that lost three contracts because its $1,000 monthly HOA fee drove total monthly costs near $3,000 for a 1,000-square-foot unit. Cancellation of San Antonio\nhome purchases\noverall has trended higher than the national average recently.\n\nAbout 10 percent of single-family and condo listings in San Antonio risk selling at a loss, Redfin found, which is above the national average. Investors have pulled back, with some resorting to converting units to short-term rentals just to stay afloat.\nBuyers\nhold the upper hand, currently. Sellers are starting to cover HOA fees or closing costs to sweeten deals, particularly around the Medical Center area, Landin said.\nMeanwhile, residents of other Texas metros have been flocking to luxury condo properties popping up in the Texas Triangle.\nIn Houston, developer\nSatya recently expanded its St. Regis condo tower\ndue to strong demand. Nearly 40 percent of the 90 units were reserved before construction started on the project. The now 38-story tower is set to rise at 102 Asbury Street between Memorial Drive and Buffalo Bayou.\nIn addition, the\nfirst standalone Ritz-Carlton condo tower in Texas\nis rising in the Woodlands. And,\nRandall Davis Company\u2019s London House in River Oaks pre-sold\nall but two of its 23 units at 2323 San Felipe Drive, reinforcing demand for vertical luxury living in the metro.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The firm focuses on developing apartment projects that include market-rate and workforce housing units via public-private partnerships with local governments.\n\u201cSouth Florida is the epicenter of the housing affordability crisis.\u201d Burns said in a statement. \u201cOver 60 percent of renters in the South Florida area are cost-burdened, meaning they pay more than 30 percent of their income on rent.\u201d\nThis marks the second time in five years that Affiliated looks to raise equity capital for its projects. In 2020, the firm launched its inaugural fund that raised $100 million, an Affiliated spokesperson said. The funds were used for current projects such as\nThe Pierce\n, a planned eight-story building with 236 apartments, half of which would be workforce housing; plus 16,800 square feet of restaurant and commercial space; and a 150-space garage in Boynton Beach. Affiliated is building the project on 2.3 acres that the firm acquired for $100 from the Boynton Beach Community Redevelopment Agency in exchange for providing the workforce housing units.\n\nThe inaugural fund also provided capital for The Dune, another planned eight-story project in Boynton Beach with 336 apartments and 2,600-square-foot of ground-floor commercial space;\nThe Era\n, a planned eight-story project with 400 apartments in Fort Lauderdale; and The Spruce, a planned 270-unit mixed-income apartment project in West Palm Beach.\nIn May, Affiliated scored an\n$80 million\nconstruction loan for The Era, and nabbed a\n$50 million\nconstruction loan for The Spruce last year. Bank of Montreal provided the financing for both projects.\nThe $250 million fund will provide equity capital for Affiliated\u2019s new pipeline of projects, including The Ray, a 400-unit mixed-income workforce housing development in Sunrise that was recently approved by the city, the release states.",

Diggs\u2019 newer firm has made more than $1 million since its 2020 launch, continuing to win\nCHA\nwork even after Diggs\u2019 2023 guilty plea to a misdemeanor stemming from an identity theft case.\nParker, who still holds a Section 8 voucher, told WBEZ she obtained \u201cethics advice\u201d about potential conflicts but wouldn\u2019t share documentation.\n\n\u201cI have no direct authority,\u201d she said. \u201cDo they have a right to participate in contracts and opportunities in a free country? I think they do.\u201d\nThe\nCHA\ndeclined to comment on the family\u2019s business ties or on Parker\u2019s role. The agency\u2019s ethics policy warns that even the appearance of a conflict violates its rules.\nThe revelations surfaced as CHA faces broader scrutiny over insider relationships. Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s stalled pick to lead the agency, former\nAlderman Walter Burnett\n, has himself come under fire for receiving CHA housing payments as a landlord.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Billionaire Ken Griffin, who owns well over $1 billion of South Florida residential and commercial real estate, wants to open a private megayacht marina in Miami Beach.\nGriffin, through an affiliate, filed a proposal for a 30,000-plus-square-foot marina with four buildings at 120 MacArthur Causeway, a 3.7-acre site on the tip of Terminal Island.\nThe facility will be exclusively for Griffin and his guests, adding to his massive real estate empire in Miami-Dade County, and further solidifying his hefty investment in South Florida. Griffin moved his Citadel hedge fund and sister company Citadel Securities\u2019 headquarters to Miami\u2019s Brickell from Chicago in 2022 and plans to develop a\n$2.5 billion\nbayfront supertall for the firms\u2019 main offices, also in Brickell. The 1.3 million-square-foot project will include a 212-key hotel, spa, fine dining restaurants with 915 seats and more.\nGriffin, 56, owns a 308-foot Viva superyacht with interior design by Peter Marino, according to Superyacht Fan.\nThe Miami Beach Planning Board will vote on a conditional use permit requested for the marina at its Nov. 4 meeting.\nDesigned by BMA Architects, the project will include a gatehouse at the entrance of the marina with security offices, and a pavilion for crew members with laundry, kitchen, gym with sauna and showers and a \u201cmodest\u201d rooftop pool, according to the application. Also, the project will have an operations center with a repair shop and marina staff offices, as well as an owner\u2019s pavilion with a grand seating area, storage spaces and an adjacent pool.\n\u201cReflecting his long-term commitment to Miami, Ken is investing to improve an industrial section of Terminal Island,\u201d a Citadel spokesperson said.\nTerminal Island, which juts out from the MacArthur Causeway\u2019s eastbound lanes toward PortMiami, currently has a Florida Power &amp; Light plant, a Miami Beach maintenance facility and a parking garage and ferry terminals servicing the exclusive Fisher Island.\n\nThe marina development site previously was owned by the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related Group, which scrapped its planned office project on the property. Coconut Grove-based Related originally had planned a 34-story, 90-unit condo tower, and then switched plans to a 160,000-square-foot office project that could have reached 75 feet in height.\nIn 2023, Related sold the property to multifamily developer Lincoln Property Company for\n$77 million\n, records show, canceling the office project. State corporate records show that the ownership of the entity One Island Park, which owns the marina development site, was amended in September to substitute Lincoln for people tied to Griffin.\nBecause the change in ownership was made through the acquisition of the interest in the ownership entity and not through a deed, Griffin\u2019s purchase price for the site is unknown.\nAccording to the South Florida Business Journal, which first reported on Griffin\u2019s proposed marina, the project could host private events during Art Basel or the Formula One Miami Grand Prix.\nForbes pegs Griffin\u2019s net worth at $50.6 billion, making him the 32nd wealthiest person in the world.\nIn Miami, Griffin paid a record\n$106.9 million\nfor Adrienne Arsht\u2019s 4-acre Coconut Grove estate at 3031 and 3115 Brickell Avenue in 2022. He also owns residential land in Palm Beach and waterfront properties on Miami Beach\u2019s Star Island.\nHis Brickell office supertall is planned on a 2.5-acre site at 1201 Brickell Bay Drive, a site Griffin bought for a record\n$363 million\nin 2022. As a whole, entities tied to Griffin have paid a total of nearly\n$670 million\nfor a Brickell assemblage, which totals about 4.2 acres\nIn the meantime, his firms are leasing space at the 830 Brickell office tower.\n",

        "content": "Billionaire developer Jeff Greene filed suit against West Palm Beach, alleging the city has improperly stalled approvals for his planned luxury condominiums.\nThe developer said he believes Mayor Keith James is delaying the project as retaliation for Greene\u2019s opposition to a city land deal with billionaire Steve Ross.\nThe suit, filed this week in Palm Beach County Circuit Court, seeks to force approval for Greene\u2019s\nHerzog &amp; de Mueron-designed condos\nplanned for the 4.5-acre site at 2175 and 2251 North Flagler Drive, court filings show. The twin towers are slated to each span 30 stories with 76 units, and will include 5,100 square feet of commercial space.\nIt\u2019s been two years since Greene received approval for the project from the\nWest Palm Beach\nPlanning Board. But since then, plans have been stuck in bureaucratic limbo, according to the suit.\nRepresentatives for the city declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation.\nAt the heart of the conflict is a land deal between Greene and the city. Greene had agreed to pay $6 million and swap land with the city to connect Northwood Road to the soon-to-be\nredeveloped Currie Park\n.\n\u201cI\u2019m not really hung up on whether I get a few dollars more or less for my land, but the city was totally unresponsive,\u201d Greene said. \u201cThey just dragged their feet, dragged their feet.\u201d\nThe 2023 approval mandated the developer and city close the transaction before a building permit is issued, the suit shows. In communications between Greene\u2019s representatives and the city, city planners argue the land deal is a condition of final approval, not just a condition of issuing the building permit. The city also did not recognize Greene\u2019s request for an extension when the planning board\u2019s approval was set to expire, the complaint shows.\n\nIn recent weeks, Greene received a letter from James stating the city would withdraw its height allowances for the planned 350-foot tall Herzog &amp; de Mueron-designed condos, capping the height for each at 111 feet, Greene said. He requested meetings with James, but the mayor canceled.\n\u201cHe was at my son\u2019s bar mitzvah, he\u2019s been to my home in the Hamptons,\u201d Greene said, describing a years-long relationship with James.\nGreene is not absolutely certain why the mayor would seek to punish him, but he suspects it has to do with Greene\u2019s opposition to an effort to\nsell Steve Ross 55 acres at a steep discount for the purpose of a school\n. In April, the West Palm Beach City Commission voted to begin negotiations with developer\nRoss\n, chairman of Related Ross, with a proposed sale price of $6.6 million. Greene said he found the sweetheart deal offensive, given his own investment into the Greene School and Bill Koch\u2019s $100 million donation to start the nearby Oxbridge Academy.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look very kosher,\u201d he said of the Ross land deal. \u201cThis mayor is just using his power to go after me.\u201d\nGreene said he hopes his towers ultimately win approval, but if not he could pursue up to $1 billion in damages from the city. He also sees waiting as an option.\n\u201cWhat we would do is leave it empty and wait till there\u2019s another mayor,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this mayor wants me to just be a land banker and not build anything, I won\u2019t build anything.\u201d\n",

It included city sign-off for annexation, rezoning and a development agreement on the long-anticipated project.\nThe community at 1100 East FM 150 \u2014 once known as Project Sahara \u2014 still needs a second reading and several follow-up steps, including formation of a public improvement district and a certificate of necessity swap for city utilities. Those are set for the council\u2019s Oct. 21 meeting.\nATX Capital\n, which acquired the site earlier this year from San Antonio\u2019s\nStreamline Advisory Partners\n, specializes in turning raw land into shovel-ready projects or partnering with other developers. The firm is also behind the 94-acre Legacy Park project in Hutto.\nCityPoint\u2019s plan calls for up to 630 multifamily units, split between market-rate and affordable housing, plus 330 single-family and townhome-style residences. About 70,000 square feet of commercial space is also slated, with 13 acres set aside for retail, 48 acres for single-family homes and 28 acres for apartments. Three acres will be donated for a municipal facility, along with nearly 18 acres for open space, trails and road expansion.\nConstruction is expected to unfold in four phases through 2038, starting with a 2027\u20132031 first phase that includes 315 multifamily units, 150 homes and 15,000 square feet of commercial and civic uses. ATX Capital committed to making at least 20 percent of the housing townhomes, a key condition council members pressed to preserve the city\u2019s comprehensive plan goals for higher density and \u201cmissing middle\u201d housing.\n\nSome council members, including Bear Heiser, expressed frustration that early concepts promising diverse housing types had been watered down.\nATX managing principal Jorge Canavati said the market, not intent, drove the mix.\nMayor\nTravis Mitchell\ncountered that existing townhomes in Kyle \u201call do extremely well.\u201d\nAustin-based Lionheart Places is leading urban planning for the project, which adds to a growing slate of large developments reshaping the\nfast-growing suburb\nabout 20 miles south of Austin.

        "content": "Vroman\u2019s, an independent bookstore with more than a century of history on Pasadena\u2019s famed Colorado Boulevard, has sold for $15.5 million, new owner GD Realty told The Real Deal.\nThe bookstore is the oldest in Southern California, founded in 1894. Vroman\u2019s is an institution that also proved to be a pioneer among bookstores, offering itself as a \u201cthird space\u201d with amenities such as coffee bars, literary readings, live musical performances and an emphasis on local ties before chains such as Barnes &amp; Noble or Borders spread the concept to malls or main streets across America.\u00a0 Vroman\u2019s shelf-lined shop floor, cafe and wine bar has hosted literary legends ranging from Dr. Seuss and Joan Didion. Its longtime owner the Sheldon family announced it would sell the bookstore at 695 East Colorado Boulevard, and another in Pasadena and West Hollywood, last year.\n\u201cVroman\u2019s has been a part of Pasadena\u2019s history for over a 100 years. It\u2019s an honor to be able to be a part of that history in any way possible,\u201d GD Realty founder Arash Danialifar said.\nThe bookstore was founded by Adam Clark Vroman, who sold his book collection to raise the capital after his wife passed away. Upon his passing he left the bookstore to the great grandfather of the current owner.\n\nWhen current owner Joel Sheldon announced he was selling, he said it was time to go beyond the family and find a new owner with vision, energy and a commitment to preserve the shop. The 80-year old owner acknowledged the change can mean a time of some uncertainty but offered a sense of optimism, too.\nHe could not be immediately reached for comment upon the announcement of the sale.\nDanialifar\u2019s company recently purchased a nine-story office tower minutes away at 790 East Colorado Boulevard, a thoroughfare famous for hosting the annual Rose Parade to mark New Year\u2019s Day, for $31.5 million. That was a nearly 50 percent discount compared with its prior $59 million price.\n",

        "content": "Chicago tech and media entrepreneur Michael Ferro is giving his Gold Coast penthouse a multimillion-dollar facelift.\nFerro and his wife, Jacqueline, are planning an estimated $2.85 million renovation of the 8,000-square-foot penthouse they bought last year for $7.7 million, according to city building permits filed in July, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nThe project will bring the couple\u2019s total investment in the landmark 1920s co-op at 1500 Lake Shore Drive to more than $10.5 million. That\u2019s about $1,312 per square foot. The Ferros already live on another floor in the same vintage building and appear to be expanding their home.\nThe planned work includes selective interior demolition, new partitions, system upgrades to mechanical, electrical and plumbing infrastructure and the replacement of windows with fire-rated glass.\nThe building, designed by\nRosario Candela\nin partnership with Chicago firm McNally &amp; Quinn, is among a handful of the famed architect\u2019s designs outside New York and one of the Gold Coast\u2019s grandest co-ops.\nThe duplex, which spans the 24th and 25th floors, offers 5,000 square feet of outdoor space, including a rooftop lawn and fountain overlooking Lake Michigan. Inside, the residence features a 39-foot walnut-paneled gallery with hand-frescoed vaulted ceilings, original limestone staircases and a carved wooden ceiling soaring 20 feet above the living room.\nThe Ferros bought the property last year. Architect Dorota Betancur is overseeing the renovation.\nColette Cachey Smithburg\nis one of the couple\u2019s real estate brokers.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear which historic details will survive the planned updates, but the co-op\u2019s ornate craftsmanship makes any renovation a delicate balancing act between preservation and modern luxury.\nThe Ferros\u2019 Chicago project comes as the couple adds to a growing real estate portfolio. Earlier this year, Ferro purchased a\n$120 million\nmansion on\nStar Island off Miami Beach\n, one of Florida\u2019s priciest residential enclaves.\nFerro, 58, built his fortune through a string of technology ventures, including Click Commerce, and later became a major figure in Chicago media. He served as nonexecutive chairman of Tribune Publishing from 2016 to 2018 before selling his stake to Alden Global Capital, now the company\u2019s owner.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The space spans 3,900 square feet and has capacity for 250 guests.\nIngka Centres purchased a\nvacant 250,000-square-foot mall\nat 945 Market Street in 2020. Last year, it completed the transformation of the six-story property into\nSan Francisco\u2019s first IKEA store\n. The outpost came with a 46,000-square-foot co-working space on the fifth floor known as Hej!Workshop and a multi-level food-hall called\nSaluhall\n.\nL4 is part of Ingka Centres\u2019 plan to create a so-called mixed-use meeting place in downtown. When Ingka\u2019s work on the building is complete, the property will offer a mix of retail, office and entertainment options. The third floor of the building is vacant, while the fourth floor is closed to the public and mainly used for IKEA\u2019s offices.\nThe food hall hosted 11 vendors when it launched, and several other restaurant spaces on the second floor of the venue are available.\n\nIngka Centres is hopeful that its revamp of a blighted Market Street property will work in tandem with other similar projects to help revive foot traffic on the corridor. This includes renovations across the street at 934 Market, slated to house a long-awaited Jollibee location, the latest opening of a Ross Dress For Less at 901 Market, and\nUniqlo\u2019s announcement\nthat it\u2019s returning to the city at 801 Market.\nThe 945 Market building is \u201cabout contributing to the development of downtown San Francisco, with community at the center,\u201d said Miia Kautovaara of Ingka Centres. The company has been \u201cfocused on creating a place where people feel welcome, where they can gather, connect and experience something new,\u201d all while \u201cstaying flexible, listening closely to its neighbors and building strong local partnerships.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Cinematic interiors will nod to The Stoneleigh\u2019s Jazz Age origins.\n\nPlans also call for a reimagined pool and terrace, a new fitness center, and programming aimed at reviving the hotel\u2019s role as a cultural hub with live music, curated events and culinary pop-ups.\nThe only cost estimate available for the overhaul is $2.725 million according to a permit filed with the state in\nMay\n, but those fillings are often estimates, preliminary in nature and subject to change. The filing only lists the basement and level one public spaces for renovation with a completion date at the end of November of this year, meaning more filings and cost estimates are to follow.\nOpening just a decade after The Adolphus, The Stoneleigh is Dallas\u2019 second-oldest hotel and a cornerstone of Uptown\u2019s architectural and social history. Its revival marks another chapter in a broader wave of luxury repositioning across Dallas\u2019\nhospitality market\n, where legacy properties are being retooled for design-savvy guests seeking local character over corporate polish.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Blink and you might have missed a string of recent changes to listings on StreetEasy.\nIn September, the platform introduced a new tool for agents to input all of the costs associated with renting an apartment. On the front end, the additions appear below the asking rent via the hyperlinked phrase \u201csee full breakdown,\u201d which opens a pop-up showing the amount due monthly and the upfront fees required to rent the apartment.\nThe update came on the heels of chatter among agents claiming StreetEasy had removed the Days on Market metric from for-sale listings. The count, however, is still featured, though much less prominently. It\u2019s now under the Property History section in a bulleted list alongside Price Change.\nWhile the changes to its interface may seem small, they mark the Big Apple-exclusive changes amid industry-wide conversations about the finer points of how brokers market their listings. StreetEasy has been fine-tuning its platform in recent months to fit a new set of circumstances.\nIt added the cost breakdown on rental listings in response to\nNew York City\u2019s FARE Act\n, which bars agents hired by landlords from charging tenants broker fees. A spokesperson for StreetEasy said the new tool will make it easier for agents to comply with the law and enhance transparency for tenants.\nBut the change to Days on Market has been accompanied by different interpretations. Some pointed to its rumored absence as the platform buckling under pressure from Compass CEO Robert Reffkin, who has\npublicly disavowed\nthe metric as potentially damaging to a seller\u2019s prospects.\nHowever, a spokesperson for Streeteasy said the choice to move Days on Market was a practical one, not a response to push back against its inclusion. (It\u2019s worth noting that Reffkin\u2019s brokerage, Compass, is\nsuing Zillow,\nthe parent company of StreetEasy, over a policy banning agents from listing properties once marketed as private exclusives on the platform, a policy the company adopted in response to the rollout of Compass\u2019 three-phased marketing plan.)\nThe spokesperson added that the platform decided to concentrate the top metrics on costs associated with purchasing the home, which would bring StreetEasy listings more in line with those on Zillow.\n\u201cFeedback from buyers shows they\u2019re looking to understand pricing information first and foremost \u2014 such as price, square footage, and estimated monthly costs \u2014 which informed this update,\u201d the spokesperson wrote in a statement.\nStreetEasy did, however, adjust the period required to reset days on market, shortening the timeframe from 90 days to 30 days.\nNot so fast\u2026\n\nBarbara Corcoran\u2019s latest trade proves the real estate icon knows what she\u2019s doing.\nThe brokerage founder and \u201cShark Tank\u201d cast member found a buyer for her Upper East Side co-op just one day after putting it on the market and sparking a bidding war. The sale closed earlier this week for $13.5 million \u2014\nmore than $1 million\nover its asking price.\nThe deal was a flip for Corcoran, who bought the five-bedroom penthouse for $10 million in 2015 and spent $2 million on renovations.\nCorcoran\u2019s 3,800-square-foot home was featured on CNBC back in 2020, when she gave her fellow \u201cShark Tank\u201d star, Kevin O\u2019Leary a tour. However the apartment\u2019s hallmarks \u2014 a lush terrace overlooking Central Park and a glass solarium \u2014 weren\u2019t exhibited in their full glory until earlier this summer, when her home made the rounds on social media again after she listed it.\nCorcoran invited Caleb Simpson, an influencer known for asking strangers for tours of their apartments, to feature her home on his social media channels.\n\u201cWelcome to my penthouse,\u201d Corcoran\nsaid in a video\nposted to Simpson\u2019s YouTube channel, standing in front of a dining table in the solarium. \u201cI\u2019ve lived here for seven years, but if you want it, and you\u2019ve got $12 million in your pocket to spend, I\u2019ll sell it to you.\u201d\nCorcoran\u2019s deal closed on the heels of a period of gains for co-ops in Manhattan, which logged a 6 percent annual uptick in signed contracts in September, according to Miller Samuel\u2019s monthly report for Douglas Elliman. Listings for the property type in the borough also rose 6 percent year-over-year.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe most expensive deal to hit city records this week was a\ntie between two units\nat 220 Central Park South \u2014 though the condos, one directly below the other, could be headed for a combination. Unit Nos. 25A and 24A each traded for $16.2 million, which if purchased by the same buyer, would bring the total to $32 million.\nThe buyers listed in the city register are two different shell companies, though the contracts were signed on the same day. Unit 25A last traded for $13 million in 2018, while 24A sold for just under $12 million the same year.\nCorcoran\u2019s Deborah Kern had the listings.\n",

        "content": "A conversion project is already on tap for the newly-rezoned Midtown South \u2014 it wasn\u2019t one city leaders expected.\nEarlier this week, developers Marty Burger and Andrew Heiberger announced the\n$25 million purchase\nof 29 West 35th Street and their plans to turn the aging office into more than 100 studio apartments.\nNews of the project, the first to take shape in the neighborhood, is coming less than two months after the City Council approved the measure, and it stands in stark contrast to the building\u2019s fate just a year ago, when\nnot one person\nbid on it when it went up for auction at just $270 a foot.\nThough it\u2019s kickstarting development in the area, the building actually wasn\u2019t among the\nroughly 60 sites\nthe Department of City Planning identified as ripe for conversion. The city actually listed a parking garage next to the building as one of the likely locations instead of the building itself.\nThe rezoning is expected to deliver 9,500 housing units, according to the city\u2019s estimates \u2014 a conservative number that doesn\u2019t encapsulate all of the sites within the area that developers could turn into apartments.\nHeiberger said he and Burger had been keeping tabs on the rezoning leading up to the deal, though they signed the contract about four months before it crossed the finish line.\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t really a lot of risk that this wasn\u2019t going to be approved, especially on the heels of City of Yes,\u201d Heiberger said. \u201cIt actually got approved three months earlier than we expected.\u201d\nWhen asked whether he and Burger were concerned about last-minute carveouts affecting the site, Heiberger said, \u201cno, we weren\u2019t worried at all.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a landmark, and it wasn\u2019t in the area they wanted to keep as the Garment District,\u201d he said. \u201cWe underwrote it based on potential to convert it without expecting air rights, so the air rights turned out to be a bonus.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: The government officially shut down 10 days ago, and the country is starting to feel the impact. A shortage of air traffic control staffers has caused flight delays at several major airports, including Newark Liberty International Airport. The Trump Administration has also begun firing federal workers.\n\nBut as the shutdown continues, its effect on the industry remains unclear. Is the uncertainty holding up deals? Are buyers and sellers asking questions? Send thoughts to\nsheridan.wall@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nA former outfielder for the Boston Red Sox, Mike Greenwell,\ndied of cancer\non Thursday at age 62. Just last year, Greenwell won re-election to his seat on the Lee County Board of Commissioners, to which he was appointed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2022. During his tenure, the board rezoned 76 acres of his land for development despite pushback from local residents.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 A four-alarm fire ripped through a commercial building on Long Island on Thursday night, drawing roughly 200 firefighters to the site in Hicksville,\nNBC New York\nreported. The fire likely began in a restaurant in the basement of the building, spreading from there and damaging neighboring businesses, including a donut shop.\n\u2014 A potential nor\u2019easter is heading toward the East Coast, and Tri-State towns along the coast are expected to begin feeling its impact on Sunday,\nCBS News\nreported. Those counties have issued coastal flood alerts spanning Sunday and Monday. New York Harbor will be under a gale watch on the same days, as winds could reach as high as 50 miles per hour.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$5.7 million\nfor a triplex townhome at 230 Bergen Street. The Boerum Hill residence is 4,400 square feet and last sold on the market in 2013 for $2.8 million.\nCompass\u2019s\nTamara + Noah Team has the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$572.3 million\nfor 1177 Avenue of the Americas. Silverstein Properties and the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System sold the one-million-square-foot, 47-story building to joint venture Norges Bank Investment Management and Beacon Capital Partners,\nper reports\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $45.5 million for 125 East 65th Street. The Lenox Hill mansion is 14,300 square feet.\nSerhant\u2019s\nMelissa Post and Ryan Serhant have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 33,564-square-foot, nine-story residential building at 3848 Bailey Avenue in the Bronx.

        "content": "A Kenilworth house that mixes traditional architecture with modern updates has sold for $6.1 million, making it the most expensive non-lakefront property to sell in the North Shore village since at least 2020.\nThe 8,100 square-foot house at 149 Kenilworth Avenue was designed in 1896 by architect Franklin Pierce Burnham. The house maintains the original neoclassical facade, but it went through major renovations in 2022 that transformed the interior with an open floor plan and modern finishes.\nThe house, on a 0.6-acre lot, has six bedrooms and seven bathrooms, along with a detached three-car garage that includes an office. The backyard hosts a large enclosed patio with a pizza oven and grill.\nThe extensive interior work and expansion of the back of the house was led by the previous owners, Stephan and Janet Scholl, who bought the property in 2021. The identity of the buyers hasn\u2019t yet been made public in real estate records. John Mawicke of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, who represented both the buyer and seller in the deal, didn\u2019t provide comment.\nIt was initially listed in July seeking $6.85 million, making the final sale price of $6.1 million an 11 percent cut from the ask. There doesn\u2019t appear to have been a previous non-lakefront sale for more in the village\u2019s history, according to public real estate records.\nThe Scholls bought the house in 2021 for $3.82 million. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2008 under its previous owners, Brad and Suzette Bernstein.\nThe house was built by the Kenilworth Company as part of the original development of Kenilworth in the 1890s. Its neoclassical design was a rarity in residential architecture at the time, and one of only a few houses in Kenilworth in that style.\n\nThe previous owners paid about $75,800 in\nproperty taxes in 2023\n, Cook County records show.\nThe house is a few blocks from the\nLake Michigan shoreline\n, and its price tag appears to be a record among inland Kenilworth properties. Even counting lakefront properties, it is among the most expensive homes sold in the village dating back to at least 2020, based on public listing services and reports.\nTwo other homes are currently pending sales with higher list prices: A mansion on Sheridan Road listed for\n$15 million went under contract\nin September, and a property off the lakefront on Cumberland avenue is under contract with a $6.5 million list price.\nThe Kenilworth house isn\u2019t the only new construction in the North Shore village known for historic buildings. Developer Leo Birov listed an upcoming new construction house this week\nnear the lake for nearly $6 million\n. The house is on part of the property he paid\n$6.8 million for in September\n, and it\u2019s likely another spec mansion is in the works on the second parcel there.\n",

        "content": "Commercial real estate professionals shuffled through a film set and gathered at stages five and six at the Lot at Formosa Wednesday morning \u2014 and after chatting over coffee and some very-L.A. breakfast burritos, they heard from Ethan Penner, the pioneer of commercial mortgage-backed securities running for governor.\nPenner is an independent candidate and a decided long-shot in our Golden State, but you would not have known the latter as he made his case to a room full of decision makers in a studio in West Hollywood.\nHe set his premise with a fundamental question: Is real estate still all about location, location, location? After all, downtown Los Angeles was hot once and now it\u2019s not \u2014 something his company knew all too well, he said, with soured investments that touched him personally.\nPenner then pivoted to the real reason he was on stage: Politics.\nHe showed some fang right off the bat, blaming politicians \u2014 not the pandemic \u2014 for the rough shape of downtown these days. Penner said we all made one of the worst decisions in entrusting politics to the politicians.\nPenner went on to trash the two parties and media for creating our current disconnect. He took aim at the toxic political atmosphere, mentioning that his son went through a breakup over the president (no more details on that unfortunately). Then he turned his longshot status into a flex of sorts, claiming that crazy things happen when there\u2019s \u201csystemic capitulation.\u201d\nUnplugged on ULA\nThe latter half of the conference was just as interesting, a panel on policy proving particularly so. Measure ULA, the so-called \u201cmansion tax,\u201d came up. California Landmark Group\u2019s Ari Kahan said it wasn\u2019t the elephant in the room, but the elephant running through the room.\nKahan, similar to others, claimed the city is redlined so long as Measure ULA is in effect. That\u2019s because, he explained, it doesn\u2019t make sense to throw your capital at development when the economics don\u2019t make sense and a tax eats your profits.\nHe said all this while the Los Angeles Department of City Planning\u2019s Kevin Keller was one person down on the same stage. He did, however, give his public-sector colleague a break, noting that Measure ULA isn\u2019t a planning issue \u2014 rather something voters adopted in a citywide vote.\nThe Max Collaborative\u2019s Kevin Ratner didn\u2019t hold back either. Investors see beyond Measure ULA when coming up with reasons to cross L.A. off their list, with many steering clear because they don\u2019t want to be around when the next shoe drops, he said. It used to be worth it, going through the arduous entitlement and development process, because then you owned something in Southern California.\n\nThat\u2019s not the case anymore, he said \u2014 investors expect bad news around every corner now.\nWill the real Leo Pustilnikov please stand up?\nLeo Pustilnikov of Builder\u2019s Remedy fame has made another downtown buy.\nHe joined fellow investors in\npurchasing\nthe PacMutual, an office complex encompassing three interconnected structures, for less than $50 million. Ivanhoe Cambridge, now La\u202fCaisse, purchased the historic real estate a decade ago for $200 million.\nIt\u2019s the second piece of DTLA history for Pustilnikov, who a month earlier\nbought\nthe Original Pantry, a shuttered diner once owned by the late Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan. Pustilnikov said the beloved restaurant and its workers were making a comeback.\nWhen he made his office buy, he and partners said they were thrilled to contribute to downtown\u2019s revival as the owners of the century-old architectural jewel box.\nIt raises the question of whether Pustilnikov is a white knight, a bargain buyer \u2014 or both?\nRetail deals by the numbers \u2014 all the way up to nine figures\nDeal number one:\nA company connected to Metlife sold the two-story shopping center called One Westside to an entity that names Mark Darwish as a manager for $66.9 million, records show. Darwish confirmed the deal; the seller declined to comment.\nDeal number two:\nMamo\u2019s Long Beach Marketplace, an outdoor retail center,\nnotched\na $56 million refinance. LoanCore Capital provided the fresh financing on the property, which is home to fan-favorite Trader Joe\u2019s and, eventually, apartments, if all goes as planned.\nDeal number three:\nCenterCal Properties, owner of 2ND &amp; PCH, and DRA Advisors\npurchased\nthe Long Beach Towne Center for $145 million.\n",

        "content": "The South Shore immigration raid that shook Chicago late last month wasn\u2019t just about border politics. It was about real estate, including some buildings that have been falling apart for years while\nowners, lenders and the city point fingers\n.\nAs\nThe Real Deal\nfirst reported,\ncommercial property dysfunction served as a prelude\nto federal enforcement. The 130-unit complex at 7500 South South Shore Drive \u2014 where ICE and other federal agents charged in with ground forces, rappelled from helicopters and arrested 37 people \u2014 was already deep in foreclosure and buried in lawsuits.\nThe city had sued property owner Trinity Flood over chronic code violations. Flood sued the previous owner and its brokers.\nWells Fargo had moved to foreclose\non three of Flood\u2019s South Side properties after she defaulted on a $27 million loan, going so far as to seek a court-appointed receiver to take over the properties.\nAmid the rigamarole, the complex devolved into chaos:\nsquatters\n, shootings and hallways so neglected inspectors stopped entering.\nThe collapse became a petri dish for a federal operation.\nStrength in Management, the firm hired last year to help stabilize the property, allegedly couldn\u2019t get a handle on it; city lawyers wrote that the company had \u201clost control.\u201d Tenants said the elevators were broken, security had been cut well before the feds arrived.\nCorey Oliver of Strength in Management\ndeclined to comment when reached by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nWhen feds step in\nWhen local oversight evaporates, federal agencies step in. Their arrival in Chicago isn\u2019t necessarily to fix real estate, but Trump\u2019s troops are apparently looking to occupy a good bit of the stuff. And, like much of what\u2019s\nbuzzing around the city these days\n, there\u2019s little clear about how that might happen or what it might look like.\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security\nSecretary Kristi Noem said the agency is looking to buy more real estate\nin the Chicago area, but her representatives won\u2019t say what kind or why. Asked by\nTRD\nwhether the department needs new facilities to sustain its immigration crackdown, officials refused to elaborate, instead citing Noem\u2019s vow to \u201cdouble down\u201d in Chicago.\n\nThe answers, or lack thereof, underscored a lack of transparency around the latest phase of immigration enforcement.\nThere is some overlap between housing instability and federal policing, and the dynamic isn\u2019t unique to Chicago. Across the U.S.,\nICE raids have sent shockwaves\nthrough rental, labor and residential development markets.\nIn Los Angeles,\nhomebuilders grew uncertain over labor markets\namid immigration raids that threatened many construction workers in the region. Similarly,\nMiami\u2019s construction sector\nhas been hit repeatedly, with ICE detaining hundreds of workers across South Florida and Tallahassee. Builders warned that lost labor, combined with rising material costs, could slow the pace of residential and commercial projects for months, if not years.\nAnd\nTexas landlord and tenant advocacy groups have struggled\nto respond to what they describe as \u201csubpoena abuse,\u201d highlighting the difficulty property owners face in navigating federal investigations.\nHousing market chill\nGrigory Pekarsky\n, head of Chicago residential brokerage\nVesta Preferred\n, told\nTRD\nthat the raids are producing a chill over the market, as some would-be buyers who have been looking for property in the area are ending their searches.\n\u201cThere\u2019s people dropping out, just simply because they\u2019re getting a bad sense of what is actually going on in Chicago,\u201d he said, noting that political rhetoric, even from the White House, amplifies fear. \u201cBusiness is down at certain places, like restaurants. All of that is just negative for the overall sense and feel of the economy.\u201d\nPekarsky emphasized the interplay between sentiment and markets. Showings are up, but offers are lagging. \u201cListings are just not getting anywhere near the showing traffic that you would think, even though it\u2019s a great piece of real estate,\u201d he said. \u201cOr, through the showings that it does get, it doesn\u2019t get the offer that you would think. You\u2019re getting 30 tours with no offers. You should be getting at least two offers from that point.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Three downtown Dallas buildings have defined the city through the eras:\nNeiman Marcus\n, Dallas City Hall and American Airlines Arena.\nNow all three are in question as city leaders strive to reshape downtown to fit the city\u2019s image as a growing metropolis and\nfinancial center\n.\nDowntown Dallas\u2019 sustained problems with vagrancy and\ncrime\n, along with outdated office-building inventory, are among the turning points pushing the central business district to Uptown.\nThe crumpled status of the original Neiman Marcus store on Commerce Street hurts, and AT&amp;T\u2019s impending departure from downtown would be a brutal blow and a signal that those problems are\nbeyond urgent\n. The telecom giant spent $100 million just seven years ago to develop a four-block headquarters campus that included the AT&amp;T Discovery District with a food hall and public plaza. Now it is searching for office space in the suburbs, potentially taking the Dallas-based company\u2019s post-pandemic return-to-office spending out of the city.\nMeanwhile, the city\u2019s play to keep the NBA\u2019s Dallas Mavericks arena in downtown could come with the\ndemolition of the I.M. Pei-designed Dallas City Hall\n. The city spent $100 million in 1978, overrunning its budget by $40 million, on a brutalist building that is meant to withstand the Texas sun and weather. More than that, it was meant to present Dallas to the world as a serious modern city after the JFK assassination dubbed it the \u201ccity of hate.\u201d\nPurchasing or leasing an office building could be in the cards for Dallas\u2019 next City Hall if Mavs owners Miriam Adelson and Patrick Dumont get a deal they like.\nCity leaders could be up against a wall there, as no one wants to be remembered for losing Dallas\u2019 last pro sports teams to the suburbs. Yet that scene could be set if Stars owner Tom Gagliardi\nexits American Airlines\nCenter in favor of Plano and the Mavs decide to develop\nan arena in Irving\n.\nAAC cost $420 million to build with major backing from city bond financing in 1996.\nAll of that is playing out against a backdrop of ambitious visions for downtown by real estate power players anxious to keep the city\u2019s center on pace with the new sheen of Y\u2019All Street that\u2019s coming with a slew of major financial industry moves in Uptown.\nThe city\u2019s $3 billion-plus\nconvention center redevelopment\nand Hunt Realty\u2019s\n$5 billion Reunion Tower-area megaproject\n, slated for thousands of apartment units, aim to turn the Union Station area into a happening neighborhood.\nRay Washburne\u2019s plans for the former Greyhound Station at 205 South Lamar Street, and Mike Ablon and Mike Hoque\u2019s proposal for Bank of America Plaza, at 901 Main Street, are also in the air lately.\nAll of the grand planning could be undone by\ncrime hotspots\n, which isn\u2019t the only point of tension when it comes to downtown dreaming. There\u2019s also the question of what Dallas is willing to offer Saks Global and AT&amp;T and the Mavericks and the Stars to retain key points of the city\u2019s identity.\n\nDowntown Dallas doldrums\nIf you doubt downtown has challenges, consider that nothing says hard times like a property auction.\nAnd Harwood Center, a half-empty office building at 1999 Bryan Street in downtown Dallas, is up for sale through online auction platform Marketplace.\nSeller\nCW Capital took over the 36-story asset from Fortis Property Group\nafter a winning foreclosure-auction bid of $80 million in 2021. Fortis bought the property in 2006 and spent $10 million on renovations in 2011, according to Morningstar Credit.\nDistressed CRE debt\nBig D and its downtown aren\u2019t alone\u2013the amount of commercial property headed to foreclosure auction in Texas this week\ndipped to $575 million\nthis week, despite broader concerns of a coming multifamily debt meltdown.\nPreston-Royal highrises\nIt\u2019s not all downbeat.\nLocal developers Burk Interests and Greenway Investment Company have a plan to redevelop 7 acres at the southwest corner of Preston Road and Royal Lane in Dallas, across from Central Market, with two high-rises. They are seeking a zoning change to develop\noffice, retail, condos and a hotel\nacross buildings rising 24 and 28 stories in Preston Hollow, where Burk Interests\u2019 Leland Burk has run for City Council in the past.\nPersonal guarantees gone wrong\nJohn Venetos is feeling the pain after personally guaranteeing $394 million in debt for his Dallas-based multifamily syndication firm Lurin Capital. Lender Acore Capital\nsued him for $80.7 million of that debt\nrecently, after foreclosing on a dozen of Lurin\u2019s Florida assets earlier this year.\n",

        "content": "Any guess why luxury home sales in San Francisco are up 14 percent year-over-year lately?\nOr why the high-end more than tripled the 4.2 percent year-over-year increase in overall sales in the city this summer?\nPut it on AI\u2019s tab.\nWith artificial intelligence exploding in the Bay Area, it\u2019s more than just offices and apartments that are being gobbled up by companies and employees. In fact, just like apartments, there\u2019s seemingly\nnot enough mansions to go around\nfor everyone.\nThe San Francisco real estate market is going through a mansion shortage, as AI barons and other well-paid executives and workers move into town and search for high-end digs to call home. As AI startups scale, luxury listings that previously sat unclaimed for months are now getting multiple offers within days of hitting the market.\n\u201cThe city is just flush with cash right now \u2014 and there\u2019s not enough inventory to keep up with it,\u201d luxury broker Peter Rodway, senior partner at Neal Ward Properties,\ntold\nthe San Francisco Chronicle. Gregg Lynn, a luxury agent with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, said \u201cthe future wealth in AI\u201d is currently touring homes in San Francisco, whether they be $2 million condos or $20 million houses. \u201cThat wealth effect is going to continue to help drive demand,\u201d Lynn said.\nThe mansion shortage is the latest evidence of the growing AI sector\u2019s effects on real estate throughout the city, whether residential or commercial. VTS\npredicts\noffice leasing from AI firms will accelerate in the coming months as demand from the sector has more than doubled in the past year. The city saw a 107 percent year-over-year increase in office demand as of last month, marking a more than 350 percent jump since\nOpenAI\n\u2019s ChatGPT was first released to the public in 2022.\nIn total, AI is expected to bring between 50,000 and 60,000 tech workers to San Francisco by 2030,\naccording\nto experts at CBRE. At the same time, the office footprint of these firms could balloon in that same period from around 5 million square feet to 21 million square feet by decade\u2019s end.\nLenders seize more SF offices\u2026\nWant a silver lining? The increasing willingness of lenders to take back buildings rather than play along with borrowers looking to \u201cextend and pretend\u201d could be taken as a sign of some fundamental faith in the Bay Area office market.\nLately the trend has visited the owners of the 1019 Market Street building, which fell into default in August. Lenders\ntook control of the building\nlast week in a foreclosure bid.\nThe building, once home to the headquarters of Zendesk, went for $10.3 million \u2014 a steep tumble from its appraised pre-pandemic value of $71.4 million. The previous owner was 1019 Market Street LP, reported to be an affiliate of Deutsche Bank asset management arm DWS.\nOther office buildings nearby have similarly faced foreclosure in recent months.\nIn August, a lender named JPMBB 2014-C22 Jackson Street LLC, listed in state records with an address at Starwood Capital Group\u2019s Miami office,\ntook over\nthe 244 Jackson Street building following a foreclosure auction.\n\nThat same month, lenders sued Kylli to place the office building at 225 Bush Street into receivership after the company defaulted on a $350 million loan backed by the property last November. In March, lender\nDeutsche Bank looked to sell\nthat distressed building.\n\u2026and other lenders look to do the same in San Jose\nThe\nunraveling of Z&amp;L Properties\u2019 Bay Area real estate empire\nhas prompted lenders to take action.\nA lending group linked to real estate executives William Wang and\nChris Jiashu Xu\nis\npursuing foreclosure\non the abandoned Greyhound bus station in downtown San Jose, the centerpiece of a monthslong fight over the Chinese developer\u2019s debt obligations. A Z&amp;L affiliate previously filed for bankruptcy in July to fight off any\nforeclosure\nthreat.\nThat doesn\u2019t seem to have done much. Now, a federal judge is trying to allow the lenders to proceed with a foreclosure seizure after handing down a ruling that would scuttle that bankruptcy case. But Z&amp;L quickly fought back by suing to block the foreclosure, claiming the lender lured them with a bait-and-switch when it came to securing a debt workout deal last year with a higher-interest loan it called \u201ca foreclosure trap.\u201d\nLike other projects in downtown San Jose, Z&amp;L had big plans for the Greyhound site but never followed through with its redevelopment. Z&amp;L agreed to renovate an old church and build housing towers on the site, though\nthe firm neglected\nit and the housing development fell apart, as did a proposed housing development on Terraine Street.\nDistressed office buildings need buyers\nIn the latest sign of the office market\u2019s slow-but-steady recovery in other parts of the Bay Area, the two-building Concord Tech Center in Concord is on the market.\nAfter lender Wells Fargo moved to pursue judicial foreclosure on the property following Partners Group\u2019s default on a $400 million loan backed in part by the East Bay office campus, court-appointed receiver Stapleton Group is now\non the hunt for a buyer\n.\nSan Francisco\u2019s One Market Plaza could be headed for a similar fate, as an $850 million loan tied to the building is nearing maturity and owners Paramount Group and Blackstone have yet to indicate what they\u2019re going to do. The duo have already\npaid down a loan\nbacked by the complex from $975 million to $850 million in order to\nsecure an extension of the loan\u2019s maturity\nfrom February 2024 to February 2026; an extension option included a forbearance that would push maturity to February 2028.\nAlameda neighborhood poised to go hungry\nBay Farm Island is in danger of losing its only grocery store, leaving residents in a food desert in the middle of San Francisco Bay.\nThe True Life Companies\nhas filed plans to build more than 300 homes on the site of the Harbor Bay Landing shopping center, anchored by a Safeway, the only grocery store on Bay Farm Island. Harbor Bay was identified by city officials as an ideal site to build new housing in order to meet state-mandated housing goals.\nTrue Life plans to demolish the existing 130,000 square feet of commercial space to clear the way for 305 new homes. Of those, 88 would be rental apartments and 217 would be for-sale townhomes; 55 of the units would be designated for affordable housing.\n",
