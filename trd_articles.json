        "content": "Luxury buyers in Brooklyn didn\u2019t wait for Black Friday to snag a rush of deals.\nThe borough notched 30 contracts \u2014 18 for condos, one co-op and 11 townhouses \u2014between Nov. 17 to Nov. 23 for a total contract volume of $101 million, according to Compass\u2019 weekly report of contracts for homes asking at least $2 million.\nIt\u2019s only the second time this year the luxury market has cracked the $100 million mark in a single week in the borough. In the first week of October,\nBrooklyn saw 35 contracts signed for $108 million\nin total asking volume.\nThe strong week continues the trend of buyers defying expectations following Zohran Mamdani\u2019s successful campaign for mayor, which had many in the\nreal estate world concerned about an exodus of wealthy New Yorkers\n. The market saw a slew of activity instead, with homes last week entering into contract with no discount, on average. The median asking price was $2.9 million and homes spent an average of 80 days on the market.\nThe top deal signed last week went to penthouse 2C at\nRAL Companies\u2019 Quay Tower\nin Brooklyn Heights.\nSpanning over 2,500 square feet with three bedrooms and three full bathrooms, the condo had a last asking price of nearly $6 million.\nThe unit features a large living room, chef-inspired kitchen and a primary suite with a walk-in closet and ensuite bathroom with cast-stone double sinks, radiant heated floors and a free-standing bathtub.\nThe home had originally been asking $6.75 million in April 2024 before dropping the price three months later. Serhant\u2019s Jim Hayes and Brad Mohr had the listing.\nThe 125-unit property at 50 Bridge Park Drive has a 24-hour concierge, fitness center, rooftop lounge and music room.\nLaunched in 2018, the development is down to its last handful of unsold units with just four listed on StreetEasy. Penthouse 2C was the final unsold penthouse at the project, according to Marketproof.\nThe project\u2019s\ntrophy penthouse sold for $20.3 million in 2020\n, setting the record for the priciest deal in Brooklyn that year.\nThe second priciest deal last week went to a townhouse at 175 Saint James Place in Clinton Hill asking $5.5 million.\nSpanning over 4,500 square feet, the three-story home features four bedrooms and three full bathrooms.\nA second-floor primary suite has dual walk-in closets, a private terrace and an ensuite bathroom with a soaking tub, along with a second room that can be used as an office space.\nA den at the rear of the parlor level opens onto a deck overlooking a back garden.\nThe home last sold for $1.8 million in 2023 to a limited liability company, according to public records.\nCompass\u2019 Tali Berzak had the listing.\n",

        "content": "The owner of Duty Free Americas nabbed a buyer for his Billionaires\u2019 Row condo.\nFalic Group co-founder Leon Falic signed a contract to sell his unit at Vornado Realty Trust\u2019s 220 Central Park South, which last asked $39 million, according to Olshan Realty\u2019s weekly report. The four-bedroom apartment was the priciest of 29 properties in Manhattan asking $4 million or more to land inked deals last week.\nAn entity tied to Falic bought Unit 32A from the developer in 2018 for\n$26.5 million\n. In August 2022, he listed the 3,700-square-foot condo for $37.5 million before pulling it off the market three months later. It hit the market again in May.\nFalic found a buyer for the unit after trading the family\u2019s waterfront mansion in Bal Harbour earlier this year. The home at 74 Bal Bay Drive, which Falic bought with his mother and two brothers, sold for\n$17.5 million\n.\nCorcoran\u2019s Manju Jasty Curry had the listing for the Midtown apartment, which overlooks Central Park.\nThe second most expensive home to enter contract was a penthouse at\n823 Park Avenue\n, with an asking price just under $27 million. Billionaire hedge funder Joseph Edelman bought the Lenox Hill condo through an LLC in 2008 for $30.5 million, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nEdelman first sought to offload the 7,200-square-foot apartment in 2021, when he listed it for more than $33 million. But the unit struggled to find a buyer a year later, even after Edelman dropped the asking price to just under $30 million, and he pulled it from the market. He listed it again in March with a $30 million price tag, though he lowered it to $27 million six months later.\nThe triplex has five bedrooms and five bathrooms. It also features three terraces, a formal dining room overlooking Park Avenue, a Jacuzzi and a home theater. Amenities in the 11-unit building, developed by Property Markets Group, include a doorman and gym.\nCompass\u2019 Maria Manuche, Clare Cukier, Michelle Flikerski, Catherine Rutter and Reilly Lavrich had the listing.\nThe total of 29 pending deals was up from 25 in the\nprevious period\n. Of the properties, 22 were condos, five were co-ops and two were townhouses. Half of the contracts signed were for new development homes.\nThe properties asked a combined $243 million, which works out to an average price of $8.4 million and a median of $5.2 million. The typical home was on the market for nearly two years and had a discount of 6 percent.\n",

        "content": "A troubled Midtown condo project is sliding deeper into disarray as its developer faces another aggressive move from a lender.\nWaterfall Asset Management is seeking to seize Rudy Gabsi\u2019s stake in 611 West 56th Street after the developer allegedly ignored an eight-figure court judgment tied to the luxury tower, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The firm filed suit in Manhattan Supreme Court to take control of Gabsi\u2019s 90 percent interest in the 35-story, 80-unit building, according to the court filing.\nIn May, a judge ordered Gabsi to pay $92.1 million for defaulting on a 2016 loan backing the project. He never paid, the suit says, nor did he show up to defend himself. With interest and fees, the tab has climbed to $93.4 million.\nWaterfall wants the court to authorize the sheriff to seize any documents needed to transfer Gabsi\u2019s ownership stake. The lender wants a judge to reroute future condo-sale proceeds from the building directly into its hands.\nGabsi personally guaranteed the debt on the project, developed with Sumaida + Khurana.\nReaching him has proven difficult. His Leny Group lists no contact information and court records place him in Tel Aviv. Waterfall and its attorney, meanwhile, did not return calls from the publication.\nThe tower opened in 2022 on a gritty edge of Hell\u2019s Kitchen known historically as Automobile Row, sporting an offering plan projecting a $232 million sellout. But units have been slow to move: nine sponsor apartments were still on the market Friday, priced from $1.1 million to $6.7 million.\nThe fight adds to a growing pile of setbacks for Gabsi, whose New York portfolio has been unraveling since the pandemic. His boutique condo at 534 West 29th Street was headed for auction this fall over a defaulted mortgage until he signed over the keys in a deed-in-lieu agreement.\nEarlier this year, he also lost six mixed-use sites in Williamsburg through a bankruptcy process after defaulting on a $92 million note; CIM Group picked up the properties\nfor $56 million\n.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani named 24 people to his transition committee on housing. Here are the real estate people who made the cut.\nMamdani started the week by naming more than 400 people to 17 different committees. The housing-related group includes nonprofit housing organizations, union reps, Yimby groups, religious leaders, tenant groups, private real estate developers and multifamily lenders.\nThose representing the private side include:\nReal Estate Board of New York Chair and Two Trees Management CEO Jed Walentas\nL+M CEO Lisa Gomez\nM Squared COO Carolee Fink\nMerchants Capital vice chair Matt Wambua\nNew York State Association for Affordable Housing President and CEO Carlina Rivera (a nonprofit that represents affordable housing developers)\nThe representatives from the private sector are largely affordable housing developers, though obviously REBNY represents various sectors in the industry. The committee doesn\u2019t include leaders from the landlord groups that mostly represent rent-stabilized owners, but it does include Rafael Cestero, CEO of the Community Preservation Corporation, who has been\nsounding the alarm\nabout\nmounting distress\nin the city\u2019s stabilized housing stock.\nSome members of the committee are also veterans of the de Blasio and Bloomberg administrations. Gomez was a senior vice president at the city\u2019s Housing Development Corporation under Bloomberg.\nFink was chief of staff to Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen during the de Blasio administration. Before that, she was executive vice president and chief development officer of the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation. She also was a senior advisor to Deputy Mayor Robert Steel under Bloomberg.\nWambua headed the Department of Housing Preservation and Development under former Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Before that, he was executive vice president of the New York City Housing Development Corporation and had served as a senior policy advisor for Dan Doctoroff, deputy mayor for economic development.\n(If the name Merchants rings a bell: My colleague wrote about Merchants\u2019 parent company,\nMerchant Bank\n, which lent to a number of people who were charged as part of a federal mortgage fraud probe. During the second quarter, the bank recorded write-downs for 14 customers totaling $46.1 million in the second quarter this year, citing fraud.)\nThe Partnership for New York\u2019s Kathy Wylde was named to a separate committee focused on economic and workforce development.\nOn the tenant side, the committee includes New York State Tenant Bloc\u2019s Cea Weaver, CAAAV\u2019s Alina Shen, Legal Aid Society\u2019s Adriene Holder, New York Communities for Change\u2019s Olivia Leirer and Community Service Society\u2019s Iziah Thompson.\nPro-housing policy reps include Open New York\u2019s Annemarie Gray, Regional Plan Association\u2019s Moses Gates and Paul Williams, executive director of the think tank Center for Public Enterprise.\nSomething else that is likely to catch the attention of the industry: At least five representatives from the Democratic Socialists of America were named to various committees.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: What issues do you think should be at the top of the agenda for the housing-focused transition committee? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Tuesday marks a largely\nforgotten\nNovember celebration known as \u201cEvacuation Day,\u201d which marked the day that British troops left Manhattan after the Revolutionary War in 1783.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 A federal judge on Monday\ndismissed\nmortgage fraud charges against state Attorney General Tish James. Judge Cameron McGowan Currie wrote in an order that Lindsey Halligan, the acting federal prosecutor for the Eastern District of Virginia who charged James, was improperly appointed and had \u201cno lawful authority to present the indictment.\u201d\n\u2014 ICYMI, the New York City chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America voted against endorsing Council member Chi Oss\u00e9 in his potential primary challenge to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries,\nCity &amp; State reports\n. Through an online survey, 626 members voted against the endorsement, 555 voted in favor and 24 abstained. After the results of the vote were released, Oss\u00e9 posted on X: \u201cNYC DSA FOREVER \u2764\ufe0f IM NOT GOING ANYWHERE.\u201d\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$6.3 million\nfor a pre-war co-op at 830 Park Avenue on the Upper East Side. Cathy Franklin, Alexis Bodenheimer, and Shannon Suydam with Corcoran had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$80.8 million\nfor the 87,620-square-foot, 12-story office building at 322-326 Seventh Avenue in Chelsea. GDS Development Management completed the project in 2022 and was sold to Capstone Equities.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$8.5 million\nfor a 2,723-square-foot condominium unit at 23 East 22nd Street in the Flatiron District. The Riback Team at Corcoran has the listing.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

Visitors to Lion Country Safari can drive through the massive park to view a pride of African lions and free-roaming herds of animals from six continents, including zebras, ostriches and rhinos.\nThe seller, an entity managed by Charles Koppel in Palm Beach, has owned the popular attraction since 1967, according to Lion Country Safari\u2019s website.

Goldbeach Properties LLC\npaid $85.2 million\nfor the waterfront estate in January. A month later, the same LLC paid $6.9 million for the non-waterfront house.\nVorcaro was arrested last week as part of Brazilian authorities\u2019 fraud investigation into the Rio de Janeiro-based bank. They allege that the bank created fake credit operations that were then sold to Banco de Bras\u00edlia SA, Bloomberg and other publications reported.\nBanco Master\nalso leased 26,000 square feet\nat 830 Brickell in Miami for $190 per square foot in rent, a record for Florida.\nVorcaro\u2019s attorneys\u2019 office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nViviane Wolak of One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, who represented the buyer in both Bay Point deals, said she could not comment. The seller of the waterfront property, Fatos Rosenberg, hung up on\nTRD\nand later texted, saying that Rosenberg does not know Vorcaro. Rosenberg\u2019s agent, Stephanie Jourdan Pedron of Consultants Immobilier, did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe $85.2 million sale set a record for Bay Point, blowing past the previous benchmark, set in 2023 with the\n$38.5 million sale\nof Adonel Concrete CEO Luis Garc\u00eda\u2019s waterfront mansion. The neighborhood is north of Edgewater and the Miami Design District.\nVorcaro\u2019s 1.7-acre estate, with 11 bedrooms, 12 bathrooms and four half-bathrooms, includes a pool, two docks and 400 feet of bay frontage. It was developed in 2008 and expanded in 2017. Records show the LLC that purchased the estate has begun construction on the property. A demolition permit was issued in August, and permits for new construction were issued in September, records show.\nEntities linked by address suggest the same buyer also purchased a penthouse at the Missoni Baia condo tower in Edgewater, and a condo at Asia on\nBrickell Key\n. The purchase price for the Missoni Baia unit was not available online, but records show a similar LLC paid $2.8 million for the Asia condo.\n",

        "content": "The City of Pleasanton is weighing a large-scale redevelopment of parking lots surrounding the Dublin/Pleasanton BART station into as many as 1,300 homes.\nThe Pleasanton City Council reviewed early conceptual plans from city staff to begin the process of redeveloping the 14.9-acre site at 5835 and 5859 Owens Drive into a transit-oriented, mixed-use community, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. Bay Area Rapid Transit owns 250 acres of developable land in 22 cities across the region; the transit authority believes the land has the potential to hold more than 28,000 units of housing.\nThe City Council reviewed two options from staffers that could eventually shape what a request for proposals from developers would look like. One option calls for building 870 to 1,088 units in two five-story buildings and two-seven story buildings; the other proposes between 1,047 and 1,309 units in two seven-story buildings and one five-to-eight-story building. The property can be split into three or four parcels, with city officials leaving the door open to future developments like hotels, offices or education space.\nThe Dublin/Pleasanton BART station was identified as a housing opportunity site as part of its housing element. When the City created that housing plan, it estimated that the site could house up to 555 units. New state legislation incentivizing transit-oriented development, however, has allowed developers to swing bigger on such projects near train stations, bumping up the purported capacity at the Pleasanton station by more than double. Under AB 2923, transit-oriented projects near some hubs in the Bay Area must have a minimum density of 75 units per acre and a minimum height of five stories; of those units, 20 percent must be set aside as affordable housing.\nUnder its housing element, the City of Pleasanton must\nplan\nfor 5,965 new units of housing by 2031.\nOther BART stations in the region are already becoming the center of new transit-oriented developments. Last year, Oakland-based affordable housing developer East Bay Asian Local Development Corporation broke ground on a 97-unit, seven-story affordable senior housing\nbuilding at the Lake Merritt BART station\n; that project is the first phase of a mixed-use development that will ultimately boast more than 550 units.\nThe\nNorth Berkeley\nand Ashby BART stations are similarly getting new developments. In July, city officials chose Adeline Alliance Partners, a development team including Pacific Companies, SUDA and Resources for Community Development, to\nbuild 620 units at the Ashby station\n. And in El Cerrito, a joint venture between Holliday Development,\nRelated California\nand Satellite Affordable Housing Associates (SAHA) are planning a 750-unit mixed-income project slated for construction in five phases.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The deal came out to just over $232,000 per unit. Though it\u2019s unclear what Orion\u2019s total investment in the complex was, the firm took over the apartments via a quit claim deed in 2018 and took out a $27.9 mortgage against the property.\nThe sale of the property at 909 East Golf Road in\nArlington Heights\nwas also the result of the companies\u2019 recent partnership. Marquette and Orion announced earlier this month that the two firms would join some of their operations and that Orion executive Dan Gumbiner would serve as an adviser while Orion\u2019s senior vice president of asset management, Cheryl Charnas, would join Marquette\u2019s asset management team as executive vice president.\nNow that Marquette has purchased the Orion Arlington Lakes Apartments at 917 West Golf Road, the firm will step in as property manager, perform renovations and rebrand the property to Avery at Arlington Lakes.\nThe spreadout, 1985-built complex of garden style units has been consistently 97 percent occupied, said Jim Cunningham, president of Marquette Management.\nChicagoland\u2019s multifamily market has been performing well all year because the city didn\u2019t experience the same Covid-era building boom that caught on in some cities in the southeast and Sun Belt.\nA steady job market and low supply of new construction has drawn investors, especially in the suburbs where they don\u2019t have to contend with Chicago\u2019s political environment. But the Arlington Heights property still faces the downside of dealing with Cook County\u2019s unpredictable property tax system.\nAs a result, suburban properties bordering Cook County have seen the most interest and that has recently extended to more buyers looking at outer ring suburbs as well.\nMultifamily sales in the suburbs were up 40 percent year-over-year in the third quarter, Chicago-based brokerage Interra Realty found, and a few outer ring counties stood out in the competitive field.\nOut of the metro area\u2019s total multifamily sales, the share of sales that took place in Kendall County was up 300 percent, and a whopping 550 percent in Will County, compared to the same time period last year, according to new analysis from Interra.\n",

        "content": "Onni Group is closing in on its second major Loop office bet, negotiating to buy the 50-story tower at 161 North Clark Street \u2014 a move that would plant the Vancouver developer directly across from Google\u2019s future Chicago headquarters.\nThe firm is in advanced talks to acquire the nearly 1.1 million-square-foot skyscraper from an affiliate of\nSociete Generale\n, which seized the property last year through a $237 million foreclosure, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n, citing people familiar with the offering.\nIt would be\nOnni\u2019s\nsecond turnaround project in the heart of the Loop. The company recently overhauled\n225 West Randolph Street\n, rebranded as The Bell, and nearly filled it at a time when most downtown landlords are bleeding occupancy. A purchase of 161 North Clark would double down on its thesis that Google\u2019s redevelopment of the Thompson Center \u2014 set to finish next year \u2014 will pull foot traffic, talent and tenants deeper into the central Loop.\nThat halo effect is already visible. Firms have cited proximity to Google as a reason to sign leases nearby, and the Clark Street tower itself just landed law firm Wilson Elser in a 20,000-square-foot deal tied directly to the tech giant\u2019s arrival. CoStar pegs the building at almost 89 percent leased, well above the downtown average of 72 percent, buoyed in part by Cook County\u2019s 106,000-square-foot swing-space lease signed in 2022.\nThe price Onni is offering is unclear, but it will almost certainly reflect the brutal reset in downtown\u2019s office values. Societe Generale inherited the tower when its prior owners \u2014 a Korea Post-led venture advised by CBRE Investment Management \u2014 defaulted amid rising interest rates and collapsing workspace demand. A discount may force the bank to absorb a sizable loss on 161 North Clark Street, which last sold for roughly $331 million in 2013.\nSociete Generale initially signaled it would hold the tower long-term, boasting of new leasing momentum even as it hired\nEastdil Secured\nbrokers Bryan Rosenberg and David Caprile to shop the property. Onni\u2019s pursuit suggests a familiar pattern for the firm: buy distress, invest in modernization and ride a potential rebound, this one perhaps driven by the Thompson Center\u2019s next phase.\nOnni has become one of Chicago\u2019s most prolific developers, best known for its residential push in Fulton Market, River North and Goose Island, where it has more than 5,000 apartments proposed. But the firm also has deep Loop credentials, owning 200 North LaSalle Street since 2012.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s top-tier apartment rents are rising faster than anywhere else in the country, fueled by a construction pipeline that has slowed to a trickle and a wave of renters willing to pay for the newest buildings in the buzziest neighborhoods.\nChicago led all major U.S. metros in rent growth in October, with typical asking rents up 6 percent year over year, Crain\u2019s\nreported\nbased on a Zillow finding. The\nChicago area\nalso slipped in the firm\u2019s affordability index, ranking 39th out of the 50 largest metros. And the market\u2019s imbalance isn\u2019t easing anytime soon. Only 9,800 apartments are under construction \u2014 just 1.7 percent of total inventory \u2014 and fewer than 1,500 are expected to be delivered this year, according to CoStar.\nPrice tags at the One Chicago apartment complex for instance, located at 14 West Superior Street in River North, start around $2,700 a month, with three-bedrooms topping $13,000, according to the property\u2019s website.\nThose eye-watering prices aren\u2019t outliers anymore, as the city\u2019s supply of attainable housing is shrinking, testing the limits of Chicago\u2019s long-touted affordability edge.\nDemand is being stoked on multiple fronts. Americans are renting longer as the average first-time homebuyer hits 40, a record high, according to the National Association of Realtors. Elevated interest rates and economic churn make renting feel safer, and remote workers with six-figure salaries continue to arrive from New York, California, Florida and Texas. Many can comfortably afford Class A rent \u2014 and compared to the coasts, Chicago still looks like a deal.\nThat\u2019s especially true downtown.\nLuxury Living\n, a boutique residential brokerage, told the outlet that gross rents for the Class A market \u2014 about 28,500 units across 85 properties built since 2016 \u2014 climbed 6.3 percent in the third quarter to $3,228 a month. River North led the surge with a 13 percent jump, pushing average rents to $3,738. The typical luxury renter is making six figures, has been leasing for several years, and isn\u2019t in a hurry to buy, founder Aaron Galvin said.\nThe high-end boom isn\u2019t limited to the city.\nSuburban developers\nare rolling out luxury products aimed at downsizers and remote workers with deep pockets. One Winnetka on the North Shore has a waiting list for units renting from $7,000 to over $12,500, developer John Murphy told the outlet. Tight supply, pricey construction and a reshuffled office market are pushing demand\noutward\n.\nBut as the luxury tier balloons, the middle is evaporating. Chicago\u2019s naturally occurring affordable housing \u2014 older, unsubsidized units that rent below market \u2014 is disappearing. Two- and four-flats in neighborhoods like Lincoln Park and Lakeview are being scrapped for single-family homes; others in areas like Logan Square are trading hands, renovated and repriced.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is an erosion of the low-cost rental supply, and that just means to the extent that renters need affordable housing, they\u2019re having a harder and harder time,\u201d Geoff Smith, executive director of DePaul University\u2019s Institute for Housing Studies, told the outlet.\nOwners of modest buildings say demand is so intense they raise rents without losing tenants. Silver Property Group\u2019s Ron Abrams likened it to \u201cshooting fish in a barrel\u201d at a recent real estate panel.\nChicago remains cheaper than New York or L.A., but rents are rising faster than wages. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows wage growth slowing and employment gains flattening. Zillow economist Orphe Divounguy warned that if that gap widens, Chicago\u2019s talent pipeline could feel the strain.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The seller of the White Rock Lake waterfront home, Darren Phillips, had originally listed the property in January of 2023 for $15.8 million and dropped the price several times since then.\nThe home\u2019s nearest competitor is a landmark estate dubbed Mount Vernon, the former home of H.L. Hunt and the most expensive listing of July. The replica of George Washington\u2019s home at 4009 West Lawther Drive has a price history similar to Haidar\u2019s purchase, having wobbled between $30 million and $15 million under the same ownership since 2012.\nHaidar co-founded the tech companies Dialexa, Vinli, Robin and Rosy, and he holds several patents. Born Mahmoud Haidar to a family of Lebanese refugees in Kuwait, he was selected in 2019 to be a Presidential Leadership Scholar, a collaborative recognition of the presidential centers of George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Lyndon B. Johnson. The younger Bush painted Haidar\u2019s portrait for his book \u201cOut of Many, One: Portraits of America\u2019s Immigrants.\u201d\nAlthough the price threshold of ultra-luxury in Texas has risen considerably in the past few years,\nrelistings\nhave taken up a greater share of Texas ultra-luxury inventory in the latter half of 2025, and price cuts have become more common.\nThe three-story main house at 4231 West Law, meanwhile, includes five bedrooms, eight bathrooms and a 2,700-square-foot basement with two wine cellars. It shares almost four acres with an eight-car garage, horse stables, a guest house and a cabana overlooking White Rock Lake, the lake nearest Downtown Dallas.\nCompass Real Estate agent Mark Godson had the listing when the property sold, though Frada Sandler of Dave Perry Miller was representing the seller in 2023, when it was the most expensive listing in Texas.\n",

        "content": "A 23-story downtown Dallas hotel with a turbulent recent history is up for grabs, adding another sizable listing to the hospitality market.\nThe 291-key Crowne Plaza Dallas Downtown, located at 1015 Elm Street and just a block from the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center, hit the market with a $55 million asking price, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. Broker Salman Tabani of Tabani Realty first told the Dallas Morning News of the development.\nThe seller is TOG Hotels Downtown Dallas, tied to California-based TOG Hotels, owned by Terry Tognazzini, who has owned the property since 2007. The hotel, last valued at $17.15 million by the Dallas Central Appraisal District \u2014 a figure that often diverges widely from market pricing \u2014 is among downtown\u2019s older\nbranded assets\n. Built in 1969, the Crowne Plaza underwent more than $10 million in upgrades in 2020 aimed at keeping pace with newer competitors.\nThe last couple of years have brought unflattering attention.\u00a0 Last summer, ownership abruptly canceled the\nDaddyLand Festival\n, a gay music event booked at the hotel, and directed attendees to leave. The move came after hotel staff received guest complaints about the gay-themded event, reportedly from members of two collegiate sorority groups that were also holding events on the property at the time.\nThe hotel\u2019s ownership entity filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February of this year, a case Tabani said it expects to conclude this month. A restructuring brought in a new management company, Arizona-based Universal Hospitality Solutions, and a new general manager, Joseph Jennings.\nDespite the rough patches, buyer appetite for downtown Dallas hospitality assets hasn\u2019t dimmed. Earlier this year, an affiliate of Sixth Street Partners paid roughly $111 million for the\nFairmont Dallas\n, a deal that signaled investor confidence in the city\u2019s convention-driven demand and its post-pandemic travel recovery.\nThe Crowne Plaza\u2019s proximity to the convention center \u2014 and to redevelopment efforts swirling around the southern edge of downtown \u2014 could bolster interest, even as rising operating expenses and softening business travel weigh on underwriting. FIFA will use the existing convention halls as its International Broadcast Center during the\nWorld Cup\nnext year all while developers work through the first phase of the project known as Inspire Dallas, a multibillion-dollar redevelopment of the convention center at 650 South Griffin Street.\nThe sale would represent a sizable step-up from its county appraisal and a reset for a hotel that\u2019s cycled through controversy, capital projects and operational shifts in just a few years.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The brokerage said two additional agents also moved their licenses to Coldwell Banker but held off on naming their publicly. When counting all seven agents, the total production over the past 12 months for the incoming wave of recruits topped $150 million.\nClayman, the former broker of record and general manager of the\nBeverly Hills Estates\n, succeeded long-time Coldwell Banker Managing Broker Tom Dunlap in early August.\n\u201cI really want to focus on driving retention and recruitment, looking at top producers across the industry given my background and the number of brokerages I\u2019ve been at as an agent,\u201d Clayman told\nThe Real Deal\nat the time of his appointment in discussing his goals in the first 90 days on the job.\nHere\u2019s a look at who Clayman recruited to Coldwell Banker, in addition to other recent local brokerage additions.\n\u27a4 Severin Braham is now with Coldwell Banker. Braham was formerly with the Beverly Hills Estates, where he served as director of operations for the Williams and Williams Estates Group, a team helmed by the brokerage\u2019s founders Branden and Rayni Williams.\n\u27a4 Hannah Babitt made the move to Coldwell Banker from Rodeo Realty.

The professional model runs a travel blog and also started a nonprofit called One Model Mission aimed at telling the stories of women from around the world.\n\u27a4 Former Hilton Hilton agent Mary Swanson is also now with Coldwell Banker. The move places her back under the same roof as Coldwell\u2019s top agent in the state,\nJade Mills\n, for whom Swanson was an assistant at the start of her real estate career.\n\u27a4 Myles Lewis, who holds licenses in California and Texas, was most recently with Compass before joining Coldwell Banker.\nHe joins with a music industry background, having served in senior executive roles at American Idol, BMI and Epic Records.\n\u27a4 Joseph Baena has moved his license over to\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\n. Baena, the son of Arnold Schwarzenegger, was most recently with LPT Realty Inc. for about a year.

        "content": "North Shore builder couple\nLeo and Milena Birov\nare setting an aspirational price on a Kenilworth spec mansion, which hit the market Monday asking $16.8 million.\nThe home is not yet built, but renderings and floor plans show the vision for a 17,000-square-foot house on the Kenilworth lakefront. The transitional-style house on a nearly one-acre lot will have seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms.\nThe listing advertises a refrigerated wine cellar, media room, wet bar and a four-car garage.\nIf sold for its asking price, it would be the most expensive home sale on record in Kenilworth. A historic six-bedroom, 8,280-square-foot mansion set the record for Kenilworth at\n$14.5 million last month\n.The home is being built by Heritage Luxury Homes, the North Shore homebuilder operated by the Birovs. Milena Birov is the listing agent on the home.\nAlthough it has yet to be developed, it\u2019s the second-priciest home listed now in the ritzy North Shore suburbs, after a Lake Forest estate seeking $27.5 million.\nLeo Birov told\nThe Real Deal\nhe\u2019s confident the home will reach its asking price, citing the $14.5 million sale at 219 Sheridan Road and the recent record-setting sale of an estate in Winnetka for $31.3 million. That record held until last week, when another\nWinnetka home closed for $32.5 million\n.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a brand new construction, it\u2019s very different than 219 Sheridan,\u201d he said, noting that house was more than 100 years old. \u201cMy lot is much bigger too. I\u2019m very comfortable with this.\u201d\nThe house has a projected construction date of 2027, and Birov said he\u2019s in the process of obtaining permits for the house. The buyer will be able to make custom specifications on the details and finishes, Birov said.\nThe couple bought the original 1.6-acre property, which covered two parcels,\nfor $6.8 million in September\n. They split the parcels and are advertising a separate house for nearly $6 million on the smaller of the two parcels, which faces Sheridan Road and does not have lakefront access.\nThe home previously on the two lots was initially listed for $14 million in 2021, but went through several price cuts before closing at $6.8 million with the Birovs purchase.\nThe Birovs are frequent North Shore builders, having listed new construction homes in Kenilworth, Glencoe, Winnetka and Wilmette. In addition to the two Kenilworth homes, Heritage Luxury Homes is marketing another spec mansion in Glencoe asking $5.7 million.\nIn June, another home they developed in Glencoe sold for $4.7 million. Their sales in Wilmette include a $2 million home on Sunset Drive in 2024, as well as a 9,000-square-foot French Colonial on Michigan Avenue that fetched $4.8 million in 2022.\n",

        "content": "Another Union Square real estate deal is the latest sign of a potential\nrebirth of the neighborhood\n.\nSuitsupply bought the first two floors of retail space in the Grace Building at 166 Geary Street at a foreclosure auction for $19.6 million, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The menswear retailer has a 5,000-square-foot store in the building with a dedicated entrance one block over at 175\nMaiden Lane\n. The retail parcel had been in receivership since 2022.\nSuitsupply was already making real estate moves at the building prior to the acquisition. The Dutch fashion brand previously took on commercial mortgage-backed securities debt by buying the defaulted loan for the retail space from the mortgage trust that was given control of the building. The\nparcel\u2019s previous owner, the Jackson Group\n, bought the 12,907-square-foot retail space in 2014 for $46 million and was facing $38.5 million worth of CMBS debt before selling it.\nThe retail space was appraised at $26 million in 2016, but its value fell to $17.3 million last year. Suitsupply opened its flagship there in 2016 and continues to occupy 5,000 square feet of retail space. The apparel company also previously leased separate office space in the building; both the retail and office leases were slated to expire this May, but Suitsupply opted to pivot to a path to ownership. The building\u2019s top 14 floors of office space are tied to a separate loan and borrower than the retail parcel and acquired by a mortgage trust in June for $5.9 million.\nSuitsupply isn\u2019t the first retailer to become an owner in the Union Square area. In 2022,\nChanel bought the 340 Post Street building for $63 million\nwith plans to eventually move its San Francisco flagship there from its current home at 156 Geary Street next door to Suitsupply; Williams-Sonoma currently occupies the 340 Post building.\nSuitsupply has seemingly been venturing further into real estate acquisitions. Last month, prior to its purchase of the 166 Geary space, it formed the purchasing vehicle Suit Supply Real Estate San Francisco LLC. Earlier this year, it registered another entity, Suit Supply Real Estate Manchester Limited, in the U.K.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Old Parkland\nhas long been whispered about in Dallas finance circles as the place where the big checks get written.\nThe home of that mystique is growing: developer Harlan Crow has added three new office buildings to the 16-building compound, which now features 842,000 square feet of office space, reinforcing Old Parkland\u2019s status as the most elite address in North Texas wealth.\nBloomberg\nchronicled\nthe phenomenon, describing a setting at 3819 Maple Avenue near Reverchon Park that leans more Ivy League campus than office park, complete with manicured oaks, marble-clad and wood-paneled interiors as well as enough artifacts to fill a small museum.\nCrow\n, heir to the influential Trammell Crow real estate dynasty, has decorated the property with dinosaur eggs, presidential portraits and even a replica surgical amphitheater. Former President George W. Bush keeps an office on-site. Prospective tenants don\u2019t apply \u2014 they\u2019re invited, and often personally recruited.\nThe expansion comes as Dallas chases higher-end office demand.\nGoldman Sachs\nis building a $500 million campus,\nBank of America\nis adding a new tower and the\nregion\u2019s finance jobs\nnow outnumber those in Chicago and Los Angeles.\nBut trophy space is still hard to come by. Family offices and private equity shops want exclusivity without the sprawl, and Old Parkland \u2014 where\nCrow Holdings\nis headquartered in a restored 1913 hospital campus \u2014 charges some of the highest rents in the city. Even so, the new East Campus is reportedly 80 percent leased, and the\nNYSE just grabbed 28,000 square feet\nfor its Texas operation.\nAccording to Bloomberg, Old Parkland\u2019s draw goes beyond polish. The property hosts roughly 450 lectures and debates a year in its underground chamber, attracting everyone from Joe Biden to Rahm Emanuel to Karl Rove. For Austin-based founder Matt Weiss, a single lunch inside led to \u201ca couple million\u201d in commitments for his AI startup and a stack of new contacts. Other tenants say the address alone signals a level of access, noting amenities that verge on the theatrical, such as a parking garage that pipes in classical music.\nCrow, now more focused on politics than development, still shapes the campus culture. The selective roll-out of new buildings and the slow-burn leasing strategy aim to preserve the project\u2019s country-club aura, a rarity in the wider Dallas office market where vacancies hover around 25 percent.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

She is also listing the house for rent, asking $79,500 a month.\nThe house was built in 1930, and previously sold for $11.5 million in 2008, records show. The lot has 220 feet of water frontage that can fit a yacht of up to 205 feet, according to a press release from Rivani\u2019s firm.\nPalm Island is one of Miami Beach\u2019s gated islands that\u2019s attracted ultra-luxury buyers seeking privacy and security. In March, gaming mogul Richard Skelhorn paid a record\n$45 million\nfor the waterfront mansion at 40 Palm Avenue, making it the most expensive home ever sold on the island.\nRivani has bought and sold a handful of properties this year.

Inside, there is a wellness suite, a private cinema, a wine-tasting room and a great room featuring retractable glass walls with views of the city. Outside, residents and guests have access to a tennis court complete with an air-conditioned viewing pavilion, a pool house and a garage and carport space capable of holding 26 vehicles.\nIn 2022, Wynn listed five of his properties from coast to coast\nfor a combined $300 million\n. That included the previous listing of the Beverly Hills estate as well as his Central Park South duplex in New York City for $90 million; two abodes in Sun Valley, Idaho for $27 million; and a Palm Beach property for $78.5 million.

Cloobeck\u2019s campaign website redirects to Swalwell\u2019s page. Cloobeck called Swalwell, a Democrat who represents California\u2019s 14th Congressional District in the East Bay, \u201ca man of integrity, and of character and values and a great leader.\u201d\nSwalwell, a former Republican who unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020,\nlaunched his campaign last week\nduring an appearance on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d\n\u201cOur state, this great state, needs a fighter and a protector,\u201d Swalwell said to Kimmel.\nHe has been an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump and has served on the House Intelligence, Judiciary and Homeland Security committees.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in these fights as a City Council member up in Dublin, my hometown, as a prosecutor in Oakland and taking on the most corrupt president ever in the U.S. Congress, but I\u2019m ready to bring this fight home,\u201d\nSwalwell said\n.\nSwalwell is the\nlatest Democratic official\nto be referred to the Department of Justice for a potential federal criminal probe into alleged mortgage and tax fraud, based on a letter from Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.\nSwalwell was accused of mortgage and tax fraud related to a home in Washington, D.C., NBC News\nreported\n.\n\u201cAs the most vocal critic of Donald Trump over the last decade, and as the only person who still has a surviving lawsuit against him, the only thing I am surprised about is that it took him this long to come after me,\u201d Swalwell said in a statement.\nNeither Cloobeck\u2019s nor Swalwell\u2019s camp immediately responded to\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s request for comment.\n",

        "content": "Newport Beach residents are going to get a say in their city\u2019s state-approved housing plan and choose whether to slash the number of homes slated to rise in the ritzy coastal enclave.\nThe initiative is headed to the November 2026 ballot after former Mayor Marshall \u201cDuffy\u201d Duffield and local organizations collected nearly 9,000 signatures for the measure that would scrap the city\u2019s current housing plan in favor of one that cuts its planned housing capacity by more than half, Voice of OC\nreported\n. The city council unanimously voted to put the so-called Responsible Housing Initiative on the ballot next fall at its meeting last week.\nUnder the proposed plan, Newport Beach would have to zone for 2,900 new homes as opposed to more than 8,000 as part of its current housing element. Of the 2,900, 2,160 would be set aside for low- and very-low-income families; the rest would come mostly from other housing projects already in the works.\nNewport Beach, like every city in California, is under pressure to meet its Regional Housing Needs Allocation; it was assigned more than 4,800 homes by 2029, including more than 2,300 for low- and very-low-income households. Officials ultimately approved a plan that nearly doubled the required capacity,\nclaiming\nthe extra buffer was needed because not every project delivers affordable units, thereby \u201callowing for market-rate units to help support and subsidize the creation of\naffordable housing\n.\u201d\nIf voters give the go-ahead next November, the\nCity of Newport Beach\ncould face off against state housing officials in court. Meanwhile, in neighboring Huntington Beach, city council members continue to challenge their own state-mandated housing quotas in court; a federal\nappeals court declined to hear the city\u2019s challenge\nearlier this year.\nSupporters of the Responsible Housing Initiative believe city leaders ignored the voter-approved Greenlight Initiative, a voter-approved law from 2000 that requires public approval for major changes to the city\u2019s general plan. Opponents argue that state law supersedes local measures \u2014 a position supported by an Orange County Superior Court judge who rejected lawsuits last year seeking to force a citywide vote. In addition, detractors like Councilman Noah Blom believe the initiative is a developer-driven effort to kneecap competitors, calling out\nbuilder Ken Picerne\nas the endeavor\u2019s primary funder.\n\u201cWe were first told that you would comply with [the Greenlight Initiative], of the city charter by allowing us to vote on the housing plan, but after two years and at the last minute, you reversed course, claiming that California law barred a local vote,\u201d former councilmember Jeff Herdman said at last week\u2019s meeting. \u201cYou\u2019re also improperly interfering with our constitutional rights to control the destiny of our community.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The building is part of Tower Plaza, a five-building complex including the 12-story office structure, that\nTourbineau bought from TPG Real Estate Trust\nin June for $22 million total.\nThe entire property spans 202,014 square feet, though the 12-story office tower is the only building at the complex planned for conversion. The remaining four one- to two-story office buildings will stay open and continue operating as they do now.\nTourbineau\u2019s purchase of the 3.4-acre property marked the firm\u2019s first acquisition in San Mateo. At the time, it was floating various mixed-use reimaginings of the complex, including apartments and hotel uses. The company viewed the property as \u201can empty slate,\u201d CIO Ben Wong\ntold\nthe San Francisco Business Times. \u201cThis was the one [property] we were most excited about.\u201d In June, Tower Plaza was nearly 80 percent vacant \u2014 a sign of the Bay Area\u2019s\nhigh post-pandemic office vacancy rate\nas companies downsized or went remote entirely.\nTourbineau plans to build studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments averaging 553 square feet. Of the 156 units, 15 percent will be set aside for income-restricted housing. Residents at the building will have access to amenities like a lounge, a gym and landscaped courtyards. It will also get an architectural makeover including a new modern facade with energy-efficient window systems. TCA Architects is handling designs for the project.\nTPG Real Estate Trust, the former lender for the complex,\nseized the property last year\nafter previous owner\nRialto Capital Management\ndefaulted on a $75.8 million loan. The $22 million sale price marked a 71 percent drop from the $77.3 million Rialto paid for it in 2019.\nEarlier this year, Tourbineau\nbroke into another new market \u2014 Nashville\n\u2014 with similar conversion plans. The firm bought the Parkway Towers office building for $12.5 million and with plans for either residences or a hotel.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The vote will take place on Dec. 2, Miami Dade College President Madeline Pumariega said.\nEarlier this month, Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Mavel Ruiz temporarily blocked the college from conveying the land to the state as a result of a lawsuit filed last month by historian and activist\nMarvin Dunn\n.\nIn his complaint, Dunn alleged trustees violated Florida\u2019s Sunshine Law by failing to clearly disclose which parcel was on the line and that it was intended for Trump\u2019s presidential library when they unanimously approved the transfer on Sept. 23. Gov.\nRon DeSantis\nand the Florida Cabinet subsequently voted to give the property to the foundation spearheading the presidential library project, which is led by\nEric Trump\n, one of the president\u2019s sons, Michael Boulos \u2014 husband of Tiffany Trump \u2014 and presidential attorney James Kiley.\nRuiz had also recently set a trial date for August. Faced with the prospect of a monthslong court battle, board chair Michael Bileca told the Miami Herald it made more sense to hold a new vote than remain tied up in litigation.\nValued at about $67 million by the Miami-Dade County property appraiser, the 3-acre parcel is one of the few remaining undeveloped sites in downtown Miami. Real estate analysts said the property \u2014 surrounded by luxury condo towers, two museums and two waterfront parks \u2014 could fetch several times its assessed value if sold on the open market.\n\u2014 Francisco Alvarado",

        "content": "New York City may be ready to reclaim a\ncontroversial piece of its past\nas a tool for its present housing emergency.\nOn Tuesday, Council member Erik Bottcher introduced a bill \u2014 backed by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development \u2014 that would once again allow construction of single-room occupancy units as small as 100 square feet, the New York Times\nreported\n. Such units typically omit private kitchens and bathrooms and rely on shared facilities.\nThe proposal would also make it simpler to convert office buildings into these micro units.\nCity officials argue S.R.O.s and other shared housing can be delivered fast and cheap enough to meet demand from single adults, newcomers to the city and people exiting homelessness. In neighborhoods such as Bedford-Stuyvesant and Clinton Hill, shared rooms with communal kitchens can rent for $1,500 or below, compared with median rents well north of $3,000.\nOfficials point to shifting household patterns as part of the rationale: single-person households rose almost 9 percent between 2018 and 2023 and nonfamily households grew more than 11 percent over the same period.\nBut others have pointed to the perception S.R.O. units have had in the city as sites of crime, drugs, overcrowding and unsanitary conditions.\nThe legislation speaks to this and would not resurrect the flophouses of a century ago; it sets operational and safety standards \u2014 for example, limiting kitchens or bathrooms to serve no more than three units, requiring sprinklers and mandating minimum electrical capacity \u2014 and would attempt to bring co-living operators out of a largely unregulated gray market.\n\u201cThese are not yesterday\u2019s S.R.O.\u2019s,\u201d Bottcher said, pitching modern, well-managed shared housing as a pragmatic addition to the city\u2019s housing stock.\nThe measure places New York alongside global peers like London, Zurich and Seoul, which have experimented with compact shared housing. City Council banned the construction of new S.R.O.s in 1955. Today, there are approximately 30,000 to 40,000 S.R.O. units in New York City, less than half of what existed in the early 20th century, according to the NYU Furman Center.\nIf enacted, the policy could free up larger units by legalizing smaller alternatives, offer lower-cost options for a growing cohort of single households and reshape how the city thinks about density.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Lenders poured billions into Manhattan office towers in October, originating almost $4 billion in CMBS debt.\nFive office towers landed the month\u2019s largest financing deals, led by a pair of trophy towers owned by Brookfield Properties. Both loans \u2014 for\n5 Manhattan West at Hudson Yards\nand\n660 Fifth Avenue in Midtown\n\u2014 cleared the billion-dollar mark.\nLenders leaned heavily on trophy assets with strong tenancy, recent renovations and deep-pocketed owners. Other deals ranged from CMBS loans backing Class A towers to an owner-originated loan that helped facilitate a major Midtown acquisition.\nHere are more details.\nManhattan West windfall | $1.25B | Hudson Yards\nCiti Real Estate Funding, Bank of Montreal, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase and Societe Generale\noriginated a $1.25 billion CMBS loan for Brookfield Properties\u2019 5 Manhattan West, a 1.7 million-square-foot trophy office tower at 450 W. 33rd Street. The loan matures in five years and has a fixed interest rate of 6 percent. The 16-story building, which has undergone major renovations, is part of Brookfield\u2019s five-building Manhattan West megaproject. The development also includes two other office buildings, a retail building, a garden and plaza, and a 62-story, 844-unit residential tower called the Eugene. Tenants include Amazon and JPMorgan Chase, which opted to\ntriple its space\nat the property back in 2017. Whole Foods also leases 60,000 square feet of retail space at the property.\nTower turnaround | $1.21B | Midtown\nCiti Real Estate, Barclays, ING Capital, Bank of America and Santander Bank\noriginated a $1.2 billion CMBS loan for Brookfield Properties\u2019 recently redeveloped office tower at 660 Fifth Avenue. The lenders also provided an $89.4 million mezzanine loan, per Morningstar, which appraised the 1.3 million-square-foot, 39-story trophy tower at nearly $2 billion. The interest-only CMBS loan has a two-year term with three one-year extension options. Proceeds will go toward repaying\nprevious debt\n, including a $750 million loan from ING Group and a $300 million mezzanine loan from Apollo Global Management. Brookfield spent $400 million rededeveloping and modernizing the 1950s building, formerly known as\n666 Fifth Avenue\n.\nLiberty loan | $900M | Financial District\nJPMorgan Chase, German American Capital and Goldman Sachs\noriginated a $900 million CMBS loan for Fosun International\u2019s 28 Liberty, a 2.1 million-square-foot office tower in Manhattan\u2019s Financial District. The refi follows a 140,000-square-foot lease expansion by Stripe that helped bring the property to 93 percent occupancy. The three-year loan refinances $895 million in existing debt. Fosun, which bought the former Chase Manhattan Plaza for $725 million in 2013, will contribute $78 million in fresh equity to close the transaction, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The 2 million-square-foot property was recently appraised at $1.35 billion. Tenants have inked 14 new lease deals totaling 438,000 square feet since early 2024 at the building once hobbled by high vacancy after losing\nMilbank to Hudson Yards\n, per Cushman &amp; Wakefield.\nMidtown momentum | $570M | Times Square\nJPMorgan Chase, German American Capital and Wells Fargo Bank\noriginated a $507 million CMBS loan for 11 Times Square, a 40-story, 1.1 million-square-foot office and retail building owned by A joint venture of PGIM Real Estate, Norges Bank Investment Management and SJP Properties. The two-year, floating-rate, interest-only loan has three one-year extension options, according to Fitch. The landlords will chip in $42.8 million in equity. The 2011 building is about 87 percent occupied, according to Fitch. Tenants include law firm Proskauer Rose and Microsoft. Last year, British company PATH Entertainment Group inked a 50,000-square-foot lease for a long-vacant retail space, where it\u2019s planning to open an immersive experience.\nNorges notch | $372M | Times Square\nA joint venture between Norges Bank Investment Management and Beacon Capital Partners\nprovided a $372 million loan for their own purchase of 1177 Sixth Avenue. The JV bought the 47-story, 1 million-square-foot office building for $571 million from Silverstein Properties and the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System. Norges \u2014 a sovereign wealth fund for Norway\u2019s government pensioners \u2014\u00a0 is taking a 95 percent ownership interest, while Beacon is picking up the remaining stake. The deal for the building breaks down to $571 per square foot. Incoming ownership is expected to maintain the property as an office building.\n",

        "content": "Readers have been sending me examples of bureaucratic city rules that waste time and money. Here\u2019s one that has persisted for decades: HPD\u2019s annual property registration.\nAs the treasurer of a small condominium, I have been doing this annoying task for 30 years \u2014 and it still hasn\u2019t been digitized.\nAs multifamily owners and property managers know, the form is online and is populated with the information from the previous year, which is helpful. But here\u2019s the problem: You have to print it, sign it and mail it in. What the heck?\nHPD\u2019s technology is decades behind. In 1969, NASA engineers on Earth could chat with astronauts on the moon. Today, someone on a street corner can FaceTime a climber on the summit of Mount Everest. Yet HPD is still using paper for property registrations.\nThat means mail by the truckload is still being dumped at the agency\u2019s doorstep and physically opened by city employees. Perhaps these millions of signed documents are being digitized and shredded, but my guess is the city leases storage space for them.\nNot only does that waste time and money, but every so often, a fire erupts and irreplaceable records are\nincinerated\n. But the main problem is the inconvenience for multifamily owners.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why we can\u2019t upload it like other things \u2014 check, check, check, e-sign and you\u2019re done,\u201d said David Eshaghoff, a Great Neck-based owner of rental buildings in Washington Heights and Hamilton Heights.\nAdding insult to injury, for the privilege of mailing in registration forms, owners must pay $13 per property. At one time, they had to pay by check. The lone innovation that I can recall in three decades of filing is that the $13 can now be paid by autopay, like property taxes.\nWhat happens if you forget to sign or miss the deadline to mail the form to HPD? You end up \u201cspending hours dealing with them because they don\u2019t respond to emails or phone calls,\u201d one landlord told me via LinkedIn. \u201cIt is awful and pointless.\u201d\nSkipping the process is not an option, Eshaghoff said, because if a building\u2019s registration is not current, violations cannot be cleared.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nDoes using contractors with higher-paid construction workers pay for itself? It\u2019s a crucial question for projects using 485x, with its wage floor for 100-or-more-unit projects. Developer Eli Lever has done the math and his answer is \u201cno.\u201d\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s true that often (but not always) these firms may produce a higher quality build in a shorter timeline, going from 15 months to 12 months on a $40 million total deal might save $1 million or so in interest payments,\u201d he said by email. \u201cThe additional cost to build with prevailing wages is multiples of that.\u201d\nAdd in the compliance costs of building a 485x project with more than 99 units and it\u2019s easy to see why few are being done. The difference is less glaring in expensive neighborhoods, Lever noted, but there, condo developers \u2014 who don\u2019t use 485x and have no affordability requirements \u2014 tend to outbid rental developers for sites.\nSend thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: About 15 percent of positions at the city\u2019s housing agencies are said to be vacant, but I suspect it\u2019s higher because the city\u2019s hiring process is even\nmore insane than I thought\n.\nFor civil service positions, even if an applicant can figure out what the obscure job titles mean and how to apply, it can take about a year to get through the process. A former employee for DCAS, the city\u2019s administrative agency, told me this cannot be fixed without cooperation from the unions. Zohran Mamdani should junk the whole system and start from scratch.\nElsewhere\u2026\nA longtime critic of New York City\u2019s real estate industry\ncomplained on X\nthat Zohran Mamdani appointed Jed Walentas, chairman of the Real Estate Board of New York, to his transition team\u2019s\nhousing committee\n. Her issue was that Walentas heads a lobbying group.\nI\nreplied\nthat everyone on the transition team is an advocate for something.\nFor a completely unbiased transition team, the incoming mayor would have to appoint only newborns. Between feedings and nap time, they would have little time to accomplish anything.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$26.5 million\nfor a 6,618-square-foot condominium unit at 520 West 28th Street in Chelsea. The Hudson Advisory Team at Compass\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was $88.6 million for 205 East 42nd Street in Grand Central. The Durst Organization sold the property to David Werner Real Estate. The three transactions included the\nfee title transfer,\nthe condo units\ngoing to one company and\nanother deed\nfor part of the condos going to two entities.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$11.25 million\nfor a 2,619-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium at 520 Fifth Avenue in Midtown. Corcoran Sunshine has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 108,838-square-foot, 29-unit, mixed-use project at 31 Church Avenue in the Kensington neighborhood of Brooklyn. Kao-Hwa Lee Architects filed the permit. The property is tied to Ben Tyberg.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "The Meadows is facing a drought.\nThe office complex in Rutherford, New Jersey, has taken a 30 percent valuation cut in the last decade \u2014 from $128 million to $90 million, according to Morningstar Credit. The property entered special servicing in May and the servicer said it recently initiated the foreclosure process.\nThe owner, commercial real estate investment firm\nAmerican Landmark Properties\n, has requested a modification of the loan, according to information provided to Morningstar.\nThe office market in north and central New Jersey hasn\u2019t recovered from its pandemic-era dive as firms\nembrace hybrid work and pursue Class A space\n.\nAmerican Landmark purchased the two-building complex at 201 Route 17 North for $125.2 million in 2015, according to the firm\u2019s website. The company took out a senior loan for $92 million from LCF and $12 million in mezzanine debt from Harbor Group International, according to Morningstar. The senior loan matured in September.\nBut by 2018, the complex\u2019s largest tenant, Malo Consulting, had defaulted on its lease. Malo, which operated a medical facility at the office complex, had taken up about 12 percent of the leasable area. That put the Meadows on its servicer\u2019s watchlist.\nThen revenue dipped precipitously during the pandemic \u2014 from $16.6 million when the loan was written to just $11.9 million in 2020, according to Morningstar Credit. Things picked back up but by 2024 numbers were trending in the wrong direction. Occupancy fell to 83 percent that year as net operating income dropped to $7.2 million from $8.6 percent nine years earlier.\nAmerican Landmark focuses mostly on office investments, and owned Chicago\u2019s Willis Tower from 2004 to 2015. Yisroel Gluck, a principal at American Landmark who is listed as the sponsor of the loan, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMost recently, the office complex is occupied by several smaller firms, with none leasing more than 9 percent of the total area. The biggest tenant, according to Morningstar, is the American arm of Japanese cosmetics company Shiseido, which owns its titular brand, as well as NARS and Drunk Elephant.\nOther major tenants include United Healthcare Service and the headquarters of tutoring chain Kumon. The office space is nearby the Meadowlands Sports Complex, home to the Giants and Jets and\nthe American Dream mall\n, the debt-laden megamall concept by the\nGhermezian family\u2019s Triple Five Group\n.\nThe office market in north and central New Jersey has slowed in recent years, according to a\nreport\nfrom Colliers International. The vacancy rate in the region has ticked up since the beginning of 2022, and currently stands at about 25 percent. The high availability is expected to remain, although 2025 may see the sector\u2019s first positive net absorption since 2019, Colliers analysts wrote.\n",

The financing will aid the conversion process, for which Rudin filed plans with the city a couple of months ago.\nBDT &amp; MSD Partners are set to provide a $250 million construction loan to Rudin. Newmark\u2019s Jordan Roeschlaub and Nick Scribani negotiated the loan.\nAdditionally, Idan Ofer\u2019s Quantum Pacific paid $80 million for a stake in the project, first reported by\nPincusCo\n, making the company a 75 percent equity partner. Overall, the recapitalization is well above the $222 million Rudin was seeking in financing, according to an offering memorandum.\nA Newmark team including Adam Spies, Doug Harmon and Josh King arranged the recapitalization. All of the parties involved in the transaction declined to comment to the Observer.\nRudin filed plans in September to turn the 21-story Manhattan office into a 411-unit apartment building. There will also be 9,100 square feet of retail space on the ground floor and residential amenities like a party room, a gym, a spa, a sauna, a plunge pool, media rooms and coworking spaces.\nThe conversion is expected to cost approximately $41.7 million. It\u2019s also expected to utilize the\n467m tax abatement program\n, meaning 25 percent of the units would be set aside as affordable housing.\nConstruction is expected to begin in the first quarter once Rudin clears the office tenants from the property. Work is expected to wrap in the third quarter of 2027.\nThe conversion has been on tap for years. As of early last year, the 1963-built property had more than 100,000 square feet of available space and hadn\u2019t seen a lease signed in nearly 24 months.\nThe firm\ndidn\u2019t immediately\npursue its conversion plan because the project didn\u2019t pencil out, but the math changed with the City of Yes rezoning, which allowed for added floors.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "TGS Management is teeing up an eyebrow-raising office play in Orange County in the form of a low-density corporate compound in the Irvine Spectrum district.\nThe Fred Taylor-led quantitative hedge fund filed plans with the City of Irvine for a 207,395-square-foot office building on a 42-acre site north of the I-5 Freeway, the Orange County Business Journal\nreported\n. The firm\nbought the agricultural parcel\nnorth of Barranca Parkway from a FivePoint Holdings affiliate in 2023 for $240 million, marking one of the priciest land deals in the region. The new project is expected to push the firm\u2019s total investment past $300 million.\nThe development has seemingly been in the works for years. Taylor formed Barranca Properties LLC, the entity controlling the land and leading development, in 2021.\nThe new offices will nearly double TGS\u2019 current office space, an entire 115,000-square-foot building at the\nIrvine Company\n\u2019s Spectrum Terrace office campus. The new office building is expected to rise two stories with one level of subterranean parking. The property is slated to feature amenities like a skate park, apool and sport courts as well as a 14,335-square-foot private recreation center.\nStill, the proposed campus will be notably low-density compared to other office campuses including its current\nSpectrum Terrace\nhome. Buildings are expected to cover 6.5 percent of the site, while a maximum of 65 percent is allowed. About two-thirds of the property is expected to hold landscaping, going far beyond the minimum 15 percent site coverage requirement for foliage.\nTGS\u2019 digs at Spectrum Terrace are similarly fenced off from other buildings at the campus. That facility has amenities like a rock-climbing wall, private gym and kitchen area for the approximately 100 employees that use the current offices there. That headcount is about one-fifth of the employee density that offices of that size typically can hold.\nTGS hasn\u2019t been focused entirely on expansion, however. Last year, TGS\nsold off two office buildings\nat 1 and 3 Banting in Irvine to Bridge Industrial for $60 million. TGS previously planned to redevelop the 165,000 square feet of vacant office space into a distribution complex.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s MLS hit back at Zillow\u2019s accusation that a Private Listing Network can pave an avenue for racial discrimination, accusing Zillow of weaponizing fair housing concerns to protect business interests.\nMidwest Real Estate Data (MRED)\n, which runs the MLS, said Zillow\u2019s recently publicized research was motivated by profit and protecting the online home search giant\u2019s access to listings. MRED dismissed the\nZillow analysis\nthat found listings on the MLS\u2019s private network were more than twice as common in majority white neighborhoods than majority non-white neighborhoods.\n\u201cZillow\u2019s approach in Illinois and its recent criticism of MRED\u2019s PLN appears to be driven less by data and more by a cynical strategic objective: securing control over listing distribution to protect its revenue,\u201d MRED said in the statement, which was also sent as an email to MLS members.\nThe MLS pointed to an internal document recently made public as part of Zillow\u2019s\ncourt case with Compass\n.\nThe document, authored in December 2024 and shared widely by Compass CEO Robert Reffkin, detailed Zillow\u2019s plans for enforcing public listings and punishing brokers and brokerages who advertise off-market listings in the event that the National Association of Realtors\u2019 Clear Cooperation Policy is rolled back. Among other strategies the document outlined, it detailed Zillow\u2019s plan to \u201cmobilize local and national organizations to publicly warn brokers and agents on the fair housing risks of reduced access to real estate information.\u201d\nZillow has been blasting\nMRED\u2019s Private Listing Network\n\u2014 which allows sellers to show their homes to all the agents in MRED\u2019s network while keeping them off public channels like Zillow\u00a0 \u2014since the company introduced its new Listing Access Standards earlier this year. The standards would block listings that were previously on the private network from appearing on Zillow, but Zillow hasn\u2019t yet begun enforcing them in the Chicago market. Zillow argued in its analysis last week that private listings cloud the market and deepen segregation in Chicago.\nA Zillow spokesperson said the company document referenced by MRED, which was labeled \u201coutdated as of 12/17/2024\u201d was \u201ccreated as a scratch pad by a few employees in December 2024 but quickly sunset\u201d because the business changed course and began developing its listing standards. The Zillow spokesperson said MRED should consider \u201cif there are unintended consequences to your practices that are leaving buyers of color out in the cold in the Chicago market.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to see defensiveness when the data is so clear that this practice is continuing Chicago\u2019s long and sad history of a segregated housing market,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nPrivate listings key to marketing strategy\nThe fight between Chicago\u2019s MLS and the home search giant comes\namid a court battle\nin Compass\u2019 lawsuit against Zillow over the listing standards. In Chicago, the Private Listing Network is a crucial part of the three-phased marketing for Compass at the center of that lawsuit.\nIn the Chicago market, 45 percent of listings this year by Compass agents started out as office exclusives, Regional Vice President Fran Broude told\nThe Real Deal\nin a recent interview. Of those listings, 87 percent end up on the Private Listing Network. If sellers don\u2019t accept an offer during those private periods, the listings generally then go public.\nBut properties that do sell during the private marketing period essentially cut Zillow out of the equation and prevent consumers who aren\u2019t already working with an agent from seeing the homes are available.\nThe frequency varies from agent to agent, and sellers have the final say on how their property gets listed. Broude said the popularity of private listings among Compass clients shows that sellers view them as a valuable way to test pricing and market their homes.\n\u201cThey\u2019re choosing to pre-market their properties and find out as a seller what their options are, from what their needs are, through our private exclusives,\u201d she said.\nCompass has defended its private listing strategy from fair housing critiques, noting that consumers who search on the Compass website are told when there are exclusive listings that match their search \u2014 though consumers have to contact a Compass agent or visit an office to see those listings.\nFair housing advocate questions MLS system\nAs Zillow and MRED trade attacks about the scale of the problem, an Illinois fair housing advocate said he has been worrying for years about the threats private listings pose.\n\u201cI have had this unshakeable, deep concern that this migration toward more and more private listing networks will just create a new age of redlining,\u201d said\nMichael Chavarria\n, executive director of Wheaton-based HOPE Fair Housing Center.\nAlthough brokers have equal access to listings in MRED\u2019s private network, Chavarria said the system is still unfair because it keeps the listings out of sight of potential buyers who haven\u2019t started working with an agent. About 43 percent of homebuyers begin their search by looking at online listings, around twice as many as the share who start by contacting a real estate agent, according to NAR research.\nChavarria said he sees brokerage-exclusive listings as a bigger problem than the MLS-wide private network, but that both limit transparency for consumers.\n\u201cTo me, the only way it\u2019s truly available is if it\u2019s available to the consumer, and it\u2019s not this fee for service that you have to have a real estate license to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it really goes back to my firm belief that people start their housing search these days long before they start their Realtor search.\u201d\nMRED vows to protect fair housing\nIn its statement, MRED said it is committed to fair housing and that the Private Listing Network was created to address the transparency concerns presented by off-market offerings.\n\u201cMRED takes fair housing very seriously, with rules and processes in place to scan all private and active listings for violations,\u201d the MLS\u2019s statement said. \u201cWe also believe that any bad actors deserve all consequences, professionally and legally, that come to them.\u201d\nMRED also questioned the methodology Zillow used in its analysis, which surveyed listings available on a single day in October. It noted that majority white neighborhoods have three times as many listings as non-white neighborhoods and institutional investors and companies that make fast cash offers on homes tend to target purchases in non-white neighborhoods. MRED argued that since every broker has access to the Private Listing Network, it promotes a fair market.\nZillow claimed its analysis controlled for price, home type, location and broker activity.\n\u201cMRED was built to safeguard open access, prevent discrimination, and ensure that every brokerage, large and small, can compete on equal footing,\u201d the MLS said. \u201cOur PLN was created to prevent exclusionary shadow markets, not enable them.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Draper &amp; Kramer is beefing up its suburban Chicago footprint with the acquisition of Eleven33, a 263-unit luxury apartment building in Oak Park.\nThe 12-story complex, which garnered more than $88 million in the transaction, was completed in 2019 and sits steps from both the CTA Green Line and Metra\u2019s UP-West Line at 1133 South Boulevard.\nThe deal gives the buyer, a century-old local firm, another stabilized, transit-rich asset as Class A rental demand keeps outpacing supply in inner-ring suburbs, according to a news release from Draper &amp; Kramer.\nNewmark represented the sellers in the transaction, Willow Bridge Property and AEW; Draper &amp; Kramer didn\u2019t use a broker.\nThe sale looks to be a win for Willow Bridge and AEW. Willow constructed the property on two former Oak Park village parking lots and later secured a $53 million loan to refinance the building from a MetLife Real Estate Lending venture in late 2023, according to Cook County property records.\nDraper said in the release that it will also take over management of the property, which is 95 percent leased and has averaged roughly 94 percent occupancy this year. The deal marks a hometown play for Draper &amp; Kramer, whose holdings stretch across major Sun Belt metros but remain anchored in Chicago. Blas Puzon, chief investment officer for the firm, said that the Oak Park apartment complex purchase amounted to a \u201cspecial opportunity to invest in our own backyard.\u201d\nEleven33 sits within walking distance of Oak Park\u2019s Lake Street retail corridor, the Pleasant District and parks, the public library and the Frank Lloyd Wright Historic District \u2014 a package that has turned the village into one of metro Chicago\u2019s most durable renter magnets. Current rents start at $1,945 for studios and scale up to three-bedrooms spanning as large as 1,500 square feet.\nUnits come with 9- and 10-foot ceilings, oversized windows, plank flooring, in-unit laundry and contemporary kitchens with quartz countertops and two-tone cabinetry. Some apartments add balconies or terraces. Amenities are in line with the product level: a 24-hour fitness center with yoga studios, clubroom and entertainment lounge, conference rooms, indoor bike storage, a fifth-floor sun deck with fire pits and grills, and a pet suite that includes an indoor dog run. There\u2019s also a 252-space controlled-access garage for residents and 148 public spaces.\nManagement of the building folds neatly into an existing Chicago-area platform for Draper &amp; Kramer that now spans more than 5,500 multifamily units across six states. Puzon said the firm is keeping most of Eleven33\u2019s on-site staff.\n",

        "content": "Elk Grove Village is emptying its net in an aggressive push to assist multifamily developer Nick Papanicholas Jr.\u2019s goal of building a new indoor ice arena on the Chicago suburb\u2019s west side.\nThe local government is playing a hands-on role, cutting a $27 million, zero-interest loan to the developer, whose firms include local builder\nWingspan Development Group\nand Nicholas &amp; Associates.\nThe financing \u2014 backed by general fund reserves \u2014 will support a 72,560-square-foot twin-sheet ice rink complex rising at the northwest corner of Meacham and Biesterfield roads, a site local leaders say has sat stubbornly vacant for decades, the Daily Herald\nreported\n. The\nvillage\napproved a 20-year redevelopment agreement and repayment term with Papanicholas, whose firms recently delivered a similar project in Rosemont and operate rinks in\nMount Prospect\nand Vernon Hills.\nAs part of the deal, Papanicholas is personally guaranteeing repayment. The\nvillage\nalso sold him the underlying 9.7-acre parcel for $4.5 million, the same price it paid to buy the property last year, and threw in two retail spaces for $1 each. The developer plans to lease the retail pads to food-service tenants.\nMayor Craig Johnson framed the financing as a catalyst play, pointing to the promise of future sales tax revenue from the project and the long-vacant state of the corner. Johnson said the village \u201chad to take a bold step,\u201d adding that it\u2019s partnering with a proven rink operator rather than an untested developer.\nDemolition wrapped this fall on the shuttered Aldi and Staples stores that previously occupied the block. Construction is now underway on the arena\u2019s structure, which will include an 8,800-square-foot second-floor restaurant, a grab-and-go shop, study spaces and a physical therapy clinic.\nThe price tag for the arena itself is pegged at $28 million excluding land, according to the project budget. Under the loan terms, Papanicholas will submit monthly reimbursement certificates to access funds.\nThe repayment schedule calls for $800,000 annually over the first five years, rising to $1 million a year in years 6 through 10, $1.1 million in years 11 through 15 and $1.2 million in years 16 through 20, before a final $6.5 million balloon payment. The facility is slated to open in August 2026 and will host youth hockey organizations including Chicago Mission and the Northwest Chargers.\nPapanicholas is already busy elsewhere in town: his firms are also behind The Vue, a 287-unit development under construction on Elk Grove Village\u2019s east side.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Coworking company Industrious is growing its San Francisco Financial District outpost in the latest vote of confidence in the\ndemand for downtown offices\n.\nThe CBRE-backed firm is leasing an additional 17,100 square feet at 345 California Street, bringing its total footprint to approximately 50,500 square feet on the sixth, seventh and eighth floors of the 35-story office and hotel tower, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The company plans to have the space fully built out by mid-February.\nThe booming artificial intelligence sector has helped inject new life into the recovering San Francisco office market. AI giants like\nAnthropic\nand\nNvidia\nhave been grabbing additional space, as have other firms like\nSierra\nand\nPostman\n. Overall, approximately 30 percent of office demand last quarter\nwas from AI companies\n.\n\u201cAI is hot right now,\u201d Peri Demestihas, head of North America real estate for Industrious, told the Business Times. \u201cBut not all of this is AI-related.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not just in San Francisco that Industrious is growing.\nLast month, it leased\nnearly 19,800 square feet\nat 220 Park in Burlingame on the San Francisco Peninsula in an effort to reach workers closer to home. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of coworking in San Francisco and a fair amount in Palo Alto, but nothing in Burlingame,\u201d Demestihas\ntold\nthe Business Times last month. \u201cIt\u2019s a pocket filled with folks who say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to go into San Francisco or Palo Alto. I want to live and work here.\u2019\u201d\nUnlike the\nformerly bankrupt WeWork\n, Industrious has homed in on selective expansions and high-quality locations rather than unfettered growth. CBRE invested in Industrious in 2020 and bought the remaining stake this year in a deal placing the coworking company at about $800 million. CBRE CEO Bob Sulentic believes Industrious can attract workers as companies adapt versatile\nreturn-to-office\nstrategies.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re beyond a return to the office,\u201d Sulentic told investors earlier this month. \u201cThe leasing markets are back.\u201d\nOther Industrious locations in the Bay Area include outposts in San Francisco, Palo Alto, Concord and Walnut Creek.\nOn the AI front, San Francisco hosts 6.8 million square feet of AI-focused offices, per CBRE data noted by the Business Times; AI companies have leased another 6 million square feet in Silicon Valley. Still, the office vacancy rate in San Francisco remains at 31 percent, according to Colliers data cited by the Business Times.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Alexander Lo bought 1704 Newton in 2024, and entrepreneurs Elizabeth and Greg Mercer bought 701 West Elizabeth in 2022.\nSellers who bought their homes during the post-pandemic boom contribute significantly to the\ntrend of price cuts among Austin\u2019s top deals\n, according to Redfin agent Abby Alwan, who represented 701 West Elizabeth. Quick flips could yield profits in 2021 and 2022, but that\u2019s not the case this year.\n\u201cThis is a situation of buying in the\nheight of the market\nand then having to sell during a rough time,\u201d Alwan said.\n\u201cWe had pretty good feedback on pricing in the private network.

There\u2019s a lot of inventory in 78704 right now, and all over, buyers are a little more picky about all the little things and exactly where they want to be because they have homes to choose from.\u201d\nThe final sale price isn\u2019t disclosed, and the deed hasn\u2019t been recorded yet, but the buyer is local, Alwan said.\nThe Mercers are both entrepreneurs.

The incentives are meant to unlock what staff describe as a \u201ccatalytic\u201d project that could feature a food hall, multifamily, retail, restaurants and structured parking.\nMahrouq has started construction on\nCaravan Court\n, a 145-key upscale hotel at 205 North Collins Street, after receiving $8 million in incentives last year.\nMahrouq has emerged as the city\u2019s most influential player on Division Street. He previously received a $7 million grant for keeping his company Ikon Technologies in Arlington while helping the city chart a\nredevelopment strategy\nfor the corridor. Mahrouq has said he intends for Caravan Court to be the spark that helps shift Division Street\u2019s identity away from its long-standing cluster of auto dealerships \u2014 many of which he owns \u2014 and toward something closer to Dallas\u2019 transformed former industrial strips.\nCity officials appear to agree. Economic development director Gus Garcia called Division Street a crucial link tying together the city\u2019s marquee districts and said the partnership with Mahrouq is part of a coordinated push to revive a corridor\nArlington\nhas been trying to reinvent for more than two decades.\nThe new agreement lays out a staged timeline: a conceptual brief within 18 months, construction drawings within 36, financing secured by month 54 and vertical construction underway within 60. Arlington will also enter a long-term parking lease on the property, which Mahrouq\u2019s group can later buy out if the full project proceeds.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Rainey Street\u2019s skyline sprint is nearly finished, but one stubborn holdout remains: a 1990s IHOP squatting in the shadow of Waterline, the 74-story tower soon to be the tallest in Texas.\nThe diner at 707 East Cesar Chavez Street is headed to a Dec. 2 foreclosure sale, meaning one of the last underbuilt corners in downtown Austin\u2019s hottest district may finally be in play. The Austin Business Journal\nreported\nthe auction notice, adding another chapter to the unraveling of Nate Paul\u2019s\nWorld Class Holdings\n.\nThe 0.8-acre parcel \u2014 appraised at $26.8 million \u2014 is among the once-sprawling portfolio Paul has shed since a 2019 FBI raid. The site has been posted for foreclosure three months running, with previous sales rescheduled, leaving questions about whether the December date will hold.\nIf it does, buyers will be circling one of the few remaining development opportunities in a district that has transformed from bungalow row to a hyper-dense cluster of hotels, luxury apartments and condo towers. Roughly 7,500 residents will eventually live in the\nRainey Street Historic District\n, with that number swelling to around 10,000 when visitors are factored in.\nNext door, Waterline is still rising; a few blocks away, the convention center overhaul is gaining steam. But anyone dreaming of a ground-up project will first have to contend with the IHOP lease.\nNeither the manager nor the chain\u2019s corporate office would comment to the outlet on its status. Developers say an expiring lease would unlock near-term redevelopment, while a longer one would require a buyout or a wait-and-see approach with rent checks rolling in. That uncertainty complicates an otherwise logical land play.\nEven so, the site\u2019s potential is obvious. Urbanspace CEO Kevin Burns, behind several Rainey towers, said the parcel is large enough to support a major high-rise. He sees a hotel or apartments as the likeliest uses, noting the freeway adjacency makes\ncondos\nless attractive. Intracorp Texas president Brad Stein also pointed to hospitality and retail as best fits, though his firm isn\u2019t a bidder.\nAustin\u2019s zoning only sweetens the pot. With participation in the Downtown Density Bonus Program height limits would be freed up, allowing the site to reach a 15:1 floor-to-area ratio, and it would be free of Capitol View Corridor constraints. Austin City Council\u2019s new temporary\n350-foot height cap\ncan be exceeded through the bonus program.\nIf the auction finally proceeds, the last conspicuous gap on Rainey Street\u2019s skyline may not stay low for long.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "After cashing out of Rockstar Energy in a multibillion-dollar sale to PepsiCo five years ago, founder Russell Weiner turned his attention from energy drinks to luxury Florida real estate.\nWeiner, who says he recently changed his name to Russell Savage, an homage to his father\u2019s radio name, started with a pair of\nmodest flips\n. In September 2020, he paid $32.9 million for two North Palm Beach homes \u2014 one on the ocean and the other across the street. The seller was Swedish model Elin Nordegren, the ex-wife of golfer Tiger Woods.\nA month later, in October 2020, Savage sold the two houses for $48.2 million to billionaire\nRobert F. Smith\n. That marked a 47 percent gain in about 35 days.\nSavage was fresh off the sale of his company, a deal that was valued at more than $4 billion, according to Forbes. The publication also pegs Savage\u2019s current net worth at about $5.4 billion.\nHe continued to bet on luxury real estate in the Sunshine State. Most recently, he signed contracts to purchase\ntwo mansions\nin Stone Creek Ranch, a high-end, gated neighborhood in Palm Beach County where his neighbors will include actor Mark Wahlberg. He\u2019s paying more than $40 million for the two houses. Another flip could be on his radar, though he said last week in an interview with\nThe Real Deal\nthat he hasn\u2019t decided what he will do with the properties.\nWhile he said he\u2019s received offers to flip both homes for millions more, \u201cthere is far more upside to go,\u201d he added. He called Florida the new Golden State, and cited its lack of state income tax, pro-business policies and perception of low crime.\n\u201cEverything keeps going up in Florida,\u201d he said.\nHere\u2019s a look at his growing portfolio:\n9303 Hawk Shadow Lane in Stone Creek Ranch\nHe\u2019s under\ncontract to purchase\nthe 11,500-square-foot estate on 2.5 acres at 9303 Hawk Shadow Lane. It\u2019s on the market for nearly $22 million with Douglas Elliman\u2019s Senada Ad\u017eem.\n16071 Quiet Vista Circle in Stone Creek Ranch\nHe\u2019s also\nin contract to buy\nthe 11,500-square-foot mansion at 16071 Quiet Vista Circle. The 2.6-acre property is on the market with Talbot Sutter of Sutter &amp; Nugent, asking $20.9 million.\n43 Star Island Drive in Miami Beach\nIn August, Savage paid $35.3 million for the 1.1-acre property at 43 Star Island Drive on Miami Beach\u2019s Star Island. The 11,104-square-foot, eight-bedroom mansion previously belonged to former talk show host and comedian Rosie O\u2019Donnell. The property has 200 feet of water frontage, two guest houses, a boat house and tropical landscaping, according to the listing. Savage plans to renovate and expand the estate into a 15,000-square-foot mansion with a master suite, gym, spa, padel court and cabana. It will likely hit the market for more than $100 million.\n5300 North Bay Road in Miami Beach\nSavage owns the waterfront 5,552-square-foot, five-bedroom, seven-bathroom home at 5300 North Bay Road. Developer and hospitality mogul Keith Menin\npaid $16.1 million\nfor the 0.3-acre property in 2024, but Savage said he is the true owner. He hired Menin to renovate the home into a seven-bedroom, seven-and-a-half-bathroom house that spans 6,023 square feet. It\u2019s on the market with Marko Gojanovic and Reid Heidenry of One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty for $32.5 million.\n5011, 5101 and 5111 Pine Tree Drive in Miami Beach\nSavage has spent years assembling land for a compound on Pine Tree Drive in Miami Beach. In 2021, Leila and David Centner sold the properties at 5011 and 5111 Pine Tree Drive, which totaled nearly 3.5 acres, to Savage\nfor more than $35 million\n. Earlier this year, Savage foreclosed on the middle property at 5101 Pine Tree Drive.\nConstruction of his massive, $100 million estate on the assemblage began in 2023, but was held up by messy litigation involving Savage and his former project manager, Andrea D\u2019Alessio, and D\u2019Alessio\u2019s companies.\n",

        "content": "Across the feast of Edwardian-era buildings that help define San Francisco\u2019s architectural style, few command reverence like the patina green Sentinel Building in North Beach.\nEven Francis Ford Coppola, one of cinema\u2019s great appreciators of beauty, couldn\u2019t help himself. The director bought the seven-story structure, modeled after Manhattan\u2019s Flat Iron Building, for $500,000 in 1973, one year after he secured artistic renown with the release The Godfather.\nNow, one year after the release of arguably his most epic theatrical flop, Megalopolis, Coppola is using the building as collateral on a private loan.\nAccording to documents filed with the San Francisco assessor-recorder earlier this month, Francis Ford Coppola Presents, one of the director\u2019s companies, has taken out a loan with Capital Holdings VI LLC, and has offered the Sentinel Building as a guarantee. The Sentinel Building, owned by another of Coppola\u2019s companies, Sofia Properties LP, hosts the historic Caf\u00e9 Zoetrope on the ground floor, and the offices for Coppola\u2019s production company, American Zoetrope above.\nThe loan amount is undisclosed, as is the assessed value of the building. In any case, a default would make\u00a0 Capital Holdings VI LLC the landlord of the property, which the\ncity designated as historic in 1970\n. Neither Gordon Wang, an executive at multiple Coppola companies who signed the documents, nor Natalie Talbott, listed as the agent for Capital Holdings VI in state records, returned The Real Deal\u2019s calls for comment.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Coppola has used the building to guarantee a loan. In the 1980s, Coppola nearly lost the building in a debtor\u2019s auction, but allegedly paid off a $1.7 million loan from Security Pacific Bank just in time to keep the property. In 1998, Coppola used the address again to secure a $1.5 million loan from First Republic Bank.\nCoppola\u2019s financial straits in recent years have been well reported. To fund Megalopolis \u2014 released in 2024 but conceived decades earlier \u2014 the director merged his Sonoma County wineries with a Napa-based brand. He then borrowed $200 million against his ownership stake to finance the project. Despite costing $120 million, Megalopolis grossed just $14.4 million at the box office.\nCoppola used the rest of that $200 million loan to fund improvements at both his high-end Inglenook Winery in the Napa Valley and the Sentinel Building.\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal\n, part of those improvements to the San Francisco flat-iron tower included converting the offices formerly occupied by his production company into hotel rooms.\nThe director recently said he was broke, telling music producer Rick Rubin in a podcast that \u201cI don\u2019t have any money because I invested all the money that I borrowed to make \u2018Megalopolis.\u201d Coppola recently made headlines when he announced that, in December, he planned to auction off seven of his watches \u2014 one of which is expected to fetch north of $1 million.\n\u201cI need to get some money to keep the ship afloat,\u201d he told the New York Times last month.\nEarlier this month, he closed on the sale of his Belize island for $1.8 million,\na move the Hollywood Reporter tied to his financial losses\nfrom Megalopolis.\nCoppola is no stranger to financial stress driven by creative risks \u2014 his 1979 Vietnam War epic, Apocalypse Now, famously drove him into debt. He has reportedly spent much of the last year in Europe, working on his next project, a musical adaptation of Edith Wharton\u2019s novel, \u201cGlimpses of the Moon.\u201d",

        "content": "The saga of the Elizabeth Street Garden is taking a holiday break.\nThe would-be developers of the affordable housing project at the Nolita site paused\ntheir lawsuit\nagainst the city over the weekend, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The freeze appears to stem from negotiations with the city over an alternate site for the project, though those discussions seemed to be taking place when the lawsuit was filed.\nThe talks revolve around 22 Suffolk Street, a smaller lot a half-mile away from the garden. Council member Christopher Marte endorsed a 200-unit, all-affordable development for that site.\n\u201cWe are pleased to have reached an agreement with the development team that brought this lawsuit that puts the litigation on pause until after the new year and withdraws the application for a temporary restraining order regarding the garden\u2019s status,\u201d First Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro said in a statement.\nDespite the pause in litigation, the developers are still against transferring the Elizabeth Street Garden lot to the Parks Department.\nPennrose, Riseboro and Habitat for Humanity New York City and Westchester filed a lawsuit a week ago alleging that Mayor Eric Adams illegally designated the site as a city park. The developers had been chosen almost a decade ago to build 123 senior housing units on the city-owned site, a project dubbed Haven Green.\nThe complaint accused Adams of deciding the site\u2019s future use without going through the city\u2019s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, or Ulurp, which is required to map land as a city park.\nThe administration claims Ulurp is only needed when it is transferring city property to private interests, not when it is moving a site from one city agency\u2019s purview to another.\nLast year, it seemed like Haven Green would\nfinally break ground\nafter years of protests and delays. The Adams administration, however,\nreversed\nits position on the project, announcing it would not kick out the sculpture garden from the site. Instead, the administration made a deal with Marte, who agreed to support the rezoning of three other sites that would net 620 affordable units, more than 400 apartments than were planned for the garden site.\nThe reversal\ndrew criticism\nfrom City Council leaders, housing advocates, developers and other elected officials.\nThe city will decide on the request for a preliminary injunction early next year, when a new mayor will be in charge.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The two-story facility is leased to the health system\u2019s Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. The\nUniversity of Miami\nis led by President Joe Echevarria.\nThe deal breaks down to $363 per square foot. UHealth paid roughly $7 million above the previous sale price 14 years ago.\nThe seller, an affiliate of Toledo, Ohio-based Welltower, paid $9.5 million for the 3.1-acre site in 2011, records show. The sale to UHealth is part of Welltower\u2019s sell-off of a\n$6 billion\nmedical office portfolio.\nCompleted in 2001 within the Newport Center business park, the building houses a radiation oncology center and chemotherapy infusion unit.\nUhealth also owns an adjacent medical office building at 1300 East Newport Center Drive in Deerfield Beach, which it purchased for $8.2 million in 2018, records show.\nThe latest Deerfield Beach acquisition is part of UHealth\u2019s growth strategy beyond its main campus in Allapattah\u2019s Miami Health District, according to the health system\u2019s website. In January, UHealth leased 11,200 square feet at Northwest 87th Avenue and Northwest 53rd Terrace in\nDowntown Doral\nfor a new medical outpost, offering services from the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute and physical therapy programs.\nThe health system also leases the six-story, 160,000-square-foot UHealth Doral Medical Center that is also within Downtown Doral, a massive mixed-use community master developed by Coral Gables-based Codina Partners.\nIn December, UHealth assembled three commercial properties near its Allapattah medical school campus for a combined\n$68 million\n, including a medical office\u2013anchored strip mall and a parking lot just north of Jackson Memorial Hospital. Last summer, UM paid\n$40 million\nfor the former Macy\u2019s furniture store at 13251 South Dixie Highway in Pinecrest, hinting at another potential health care expansion.",

Now, as a Los Angeles mayoral hopeful, can the movement organizer and ordained Presbyterian minister bridge the gap with the industry?\nSince the dues-paying member of the Democratic Socialists of America and Sawtelle resident announced the launch of her campaign earlier this month at an Arts District brewery, the public has been served broad strokes on a platform. The pledges might sound like familiar fodder from left-of-center, but they take on recent resonance on the heels of winning campaigns by one-time longshots in New York City and Seattle: Affordable housing, free transit, transition to renewable energy and addressing public safety through a boost in mental health services.\n\u201cWe need a new kind of leadership, free from the tired establishment and the billionaire class,\u201d Huang said in her launch video. \u201cMayor Bass failed to deliver the housing you need and wasted taxpayer dollars with little to show for it.\u201d\nThe launch video zeroed in on a particular sore point of commercial real estate, showing the bankruptcy, abandoned and graffiti-scarred towers of the Oceanwide Plaza across the the Los Angeles Convention Center as a knock on Bass\u2019s effectiveness.\nHuang currently works as deputy director of Housing Now! California, a Los Angeles organization that calls itself a \u201cmovement\u201d pushing for affordable housing. The group is aligned with over 150 other organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, multiple local DSA chapters, the Los Angeles Tenants Union, Eviction Defense Network and other groups.\nIt\u2019s early for Huang\u2019s campaign and money raised has not yet been reported to the city\u2019s Ethics Committee, according to a check of records Tuesday.\nWhile the immediate reaction to Huang\u2019s bid for mayor was to liken her to New York\u2019s\nZohran Mamdani\n\u2014 and there are similarities \u2014 others have put a finer point on it. Indeed, some political spectators see Huang as a longshot who nevertheless holds the potential to play a key role in forcing a runoff by keeping Bass from a clear majority in the June primary. Candidates need more than 50 percent of the votes to clinch a victory in the first round, and Huang along with former Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent and City Hall veteran Austin Beutner and 11 others could lay the field wide open.\nFormer Los Angeles County Board of Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky pointed out to the\nLos Angeles Daily News\nthat LA is more diverse when it comes to its voter base than New York or Seattle, both of which voted in so-called \u201clongshot\u201d candidates with Mamdani and\nKatie Wilson\n, respectively. Those diverse views could prove to be an uphill battle for Huang if she has to hunt up votes in the San Fernando Valley, which has traditionally been more conservative than the rest of the city.\nThe mayoral hopeful did not respond to an interview request from\nThe Real Deal\nMonday, and she has yet to stake a clear position on\nMeasure United to House LA\n, the city\u2019s so-called mansion tax.\nLegislative maneuvering\nHuang did tell the\nLos Angeles Times\nshe supports the 120-unit affordable housing project on Venice Boulevard, known as Venice Dell.\nA look back at legislation Housing Now! has supported offers a closer view of her broader outlook, with one clue apparent in the backing Housing Now! gave SB 567, which was authored by longtime labor leader Maria Elena Durazo (D-Los Angeles) and boosted tenant protections in 2023.\nThe California Apartment Association, California Association of Realtors, Apartment Association of Orange County, Building Owners and Managers Association of California and Institute of Real Estate Management were among the industry groups opposed to the bill.\nThe law creates more restrictions in no-fault evictions, where a landlord seeks to end a lease for reasons unrelated to the tenant, such as major remodeling or a decision to take the unit off market.\nHuang\u2019s group also backed SB 555, authored by Aisha Wahab (D-Hayward) and signed into law in 2023.\nThe California Association of Realtors was among SB 555\u2019s opposition.\nThe bill requires the state\u2019s Department of Housing and Community Development to complete a social housing study. This would map out how to increase social housing for low- to moderate-income residents.\n\u201cSocial Housing\u201d\nHuang spoke on the concept of \u201csocial housing\u201d \u2014 which can range from publicly-owned developments to tenants taking ownership cooperatively \u2014 during a May\npanel\nhosted by affordable housing publication Shelterforce and Nonprofit Quarterly. She said she sees a need for publicly- or community-owned housing when it comes to answers around funding, development and acquisition.\n\u201cOne of the challenges, and one of the dangers, with [private involvement] is that if we do lean into private funding for social housing, it does then return back into the same old situation that we have, in which case then it becomes another place of profit,\u201d Huang said during the panel.\nThe state\u2019s Housing and Community Development agency, meanwhile, tapped UC Berkeley\u2019s Terner Center for Housing Innovation to handle the SB 555 report, with the study expected to be completed by 2027.\nIt\u2019s been estimated the study could pave the way for anywhere between 1.2 million and 1.4 million affordable homes. It could also hold implications for cities\u2019 housing elements \u2014 the roadmap municipalities are required to create for their long-term housing plans. Those plans must be certified by the state. Notably, an unapproved housing plan paves the way for developers\u2019 use of builder\u2019s remedy, which has been tapped for projects in\nLa Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge\nand\nBeverly Hills\n.\nState of play\nHuang enters a candidate pool that\u2019s so far stirred little buzz outside of political circles.\nFirst off, there\u2019s incumbent Mayor Karen Bass, who has raised $1.6 million, according to city records through June 30. However, Bass has been dogged by the handling of the\nPalisades Fire\nleading some calls for her\nresignation\n, and a nearly $1 billion budget deficit earlier this year that has since been closed.\nA total of 13 challengers to Bass have emerged so far. The biggest name currently is Beutner, a Democrat. There\u2019s also Asaad Alnajjar, a civil engineer and chair of Porter Ranch Neighborhood Council\u2019s Safety and Transit Committee. Alnajjar has raised nearly $39,000 from the CEO of Los Angeles-based Caltron Construction and the head of Hillsborough venture capital firm Andra Capital among others, according to city records.\nAnother potential candidate is\nRick Caruso\n, with the developer yet to say whether he might make another run for mayor, pursue the governor\u2019s office or sit out electoral politics in 2026.\n",

        "content": "A long-contested slice of Schaumburg near the Rolling Meadows border is back in play, this time with fewer units and a potential tax boost to make the numbers work.\nThe village is set to kick off a public process next month that could extend a nearby tax increment financing district to cover the 33-acre Loeber Farm property, even as a revised residential plan heads to its first hearing. The Daily Herald\nreported\nthat on Dec. 9 the village board will begin weighing whether to stretch its existing TIF district north of Algonquin Road.\nThe next day, the zoning board of appeals will take up Nitti Group LLC\u2019s new proposal for 122 for-sale homes \u2014 a mix of single-family houses, row homes and townhouses. It\u2019s a significant downshift from the\n357-unit rental-heavy plan\nthat sparked pushback from Rolling Meadows residents and officials last year. That version never reached a trustee vote.\nThe property, situated off Meacham Road near Algonquin Road, has a long history within the Loeber family, which is known for its luxury car dealerships. Purchased as a rural retreat, the site was used to raise racehorses and foster a countryside upbringing for the Loeber children.\nAttempts to develop the land have been ongoing since 2002 but have repeatedly stalled, most recently in 2016 when a proposal for 92 homes was rejected. The revised plan from\nNitti\nwas proposed last year.\nThe Nitti plan carries an estimated $82 million price tag. Schaumburg is considering directing $4.8 million in\nTIF-eligible spending\ntoward needed infrastructure, a fraction of the roughly $17 million the site is expected to generate before the district expires. The TIF is already 12 years old and could run only another decade, but officials say that\u2019s enough time to produce the required revenue.\nThe Loeber land has drawn a parade of redevelopment concepts over the years, but none sought TIF help until now. The district already covers the Verdian redevelopment and the emerging entertainment pocket along Meacham Road.\nVillage officials said infrastructure challenges on the site have kept density high in past proposals. Elevation swings require a sanitary lift station. The creek needs a bridge stout enough to support fire trucks, a fix the mayor pegs at $1 million. Water and sewer extensions aren\u2019t cheap either.\nSchaumburg\u2019s economic development\ndirector has called these \u201cextraordinary\u201d costs \u2014 the kind TIF dollars are designed to offset.\nMayor Tom Dailly said the village wants the TIF and development tracks to move in tandem. He also argued the incentive could be the lever that finally brings the project\u2019s scale in line with neighborhood expectations, adding the new plans provide an opportunity to reduce density.\nA joint review board representing local taxing bodies will need to be reconvened as part of the extension process. With required notices baked in, the village board could vote on the TIF expansion as soon as March.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A group of building owners claims New York\u2019s housing regulator is unlawfully coming after them for deregulating their rent-stabilized properties.\n\u201cBalanced Housing Solutions,\u201d the group listed as plaintiffs and led by political consultant Hank Sheinkopf, is suing the Division of Homes and Community Renewal, alleging that the agency is wrongfully applying rule changes around \u201csubstantial rehabilitations\u201d that went into effect in 2023. Former mayoral candidate Jim Walden is the group\u2019s attorney on the case.\nSubstantial rehabs are one of the only remaining avenues for owners looking to deregulate stabilized apartments after the state passed sweeping rent reform legislation in 2019.\nThe state defines a substantial rehab as the replacement of at least 75 percent of a building\u2019s systems in a property that is \u201csubstandard or seriously deteriorated.\u201d It matters how the building got that way: An owner can\u2019t deregulate their building if they drove tenants out through harassment or, on the extreme end, arson.\nOne way owners used to be able to prove a building was \u201csubstandard or seriously deteriorated\u201d and in need of renovation was if it was at least 80 percent vacant. The thinking was that if a building was mostly vacant, it was in bad shape and needed an overhaul.\nHCR proposed eliminating that option in 2022, and then\nfinalized\ngetting rid of it in November 2023.\nIn June of that year, state lawmakers\napproved\nlegislation that would have required owners of buildings that had undergone substantial rehabilitation to submit applications to HCR within six months of the bill becoming law. In other words, the agency would need to retroactively approve deregulation for every building that had been gut-renovated and deregulated. In some cases, this would have happened decades ago. The\nmeasure\nalso reiterated the emphasis on the need to prove that a building was in \u201csubstandard or seriously deteriorated condition,\u201d with no mention of a vacancy threshold.\nGov. Kathy Hochul\napproved\nthe\nmeasure\n, but with key changes, such as striking the retroactive nature of the bill: The new application rule would apply to substantial renovations initiated on or after January 1, 2024. Owners, from that point on, would need to submit applications to the state within one year of completing a substantial rehab in order to legally deregulate the building.\nThe group of owners suing the state argues that, despite completing work before November 2023, when HCR issued its new rules, the agency is trying to enforce the new regime, demanding proof that a building was \u201cuninhabitable\u201d rather than just at least 80 percent vacant.\nThe move violates the Fifth Amendment\u2019s takings clause, according to the lawsuit.\n\u201cThe bottom line here is that BHS\u2019s members invested tens of millions of dollars in rehabilitating housing for New Yorkers, and HCR is attempting to seize and/or redistribute the fruits of that investment through a fundamentally unfair, retroactive application of new rules to already completed projects, despite the fact that the Governor and then the Legislature expressly rejected any retroactive application of the Amendments,\u201d the lawsuit states.\nThe lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, seeks an injunction barring the HCR from retroactively applying the November 2023 rules to substantial rehabs that were initiated before the new guidelines.\nAn HCR spokesperson said the agency doesn\u2019t comment on pending litigation.\nJim Walden, attorney for Balance Housing Solutions and previously an independent candidate for mayor, would not disclose specific properties or owners who are part of the group that filed the lawsuit. During a video press conference on Wednesday, he said the specific owners would not be disclosed at this point due to fear of retaliation from regulators. Presumably, if the lawsuit continues, the claims of specific owners will need to be presented to the court.\nThe owners renovated 31 buildings, all of which were at least 80 percent vacant at the time, according to the lawsuit. HCR is calling for the properties to be re-regulated and for the owners to reimburse tenants for rent overcharges resulting from the buildings\u2019 deregulation, the lawsuit states.\nThe lawsuit also alleges that HCR has erroneously determined that any vacancies achieved through buyouts can\u2019t count toward the 80 percent threshold. Walden indicated that HCR applied this interpretation of the 80 percent rule sometime in 2023, though it isn\u2019t clear if this happened exclusively before the November 2023 rule change.\nThe Real Deal\npreviously\nhighlighted\nHCR\u2019s rejections of a rehab application at 117 North Fourth Street in Williamsburg. An entity called Creas Inc. bought the building for $9.75 million in 2023 from an LLC linked to Jeff Sutton\u2019s Wharton Properties.\nThe building was deregulated after a substantial rehab in 2022.\nHCR said one of the reasons the renovation didn\u2019t meet its criteria was because three tenants who vacated the building had accepted buyouts ranging from $150,000 to $175,000. The agency maintained that the pricing of the buyouts suggested the properties weren\u2019t in poor shape.\nWalden, who dropped out of the mayoral race ahead of the general election and endorsed former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, has been critical of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani\u2019s plan to freeze rents for stabilized tenants for four years. He indicated on Wednesday that the lawsuit would likely be the first of many battles related to bringing \u201cmore common sense to the city\u201d when it comes to maintaining and growing the city\u2019s housing stock.\n",

        "content": "One of Chicago\u2019s most neglected subsidized housing complexes is poised for new ownership, ending a turbulent run under a pair of out-of-state investors who branded their company after a Ferris Bueller joke.\nIndian Trails Apartments \u2014 a 180-unit Section 8 development at 221 East 121st Place in West Pullman \u2014 is under contract to be sold as tenants recount years of unsafe conditions, revolving management and broken promises of repairs, WBEZ\nreported\nin partnership with the Chicago Sun-Times.\nThe property\u2019s current owner, the Sausage King of Chicago, is primarily controlled by California investors\nAlan Smolinisky and Brian Chien-Chih Chen\n, best known for a portfolio of HUD-subsidized buildings held through companies named after 1980s movies. Public records show entities linked to their businesses collected more than $37 million in federal rent subsidies last year across 24 properties in 13 states. Indian Trails alone brought in over $2 million in HUD payments.\nResidents say the revenue hasn\u2019t shown up in their buildings. Since the complex was acquired in 2017 for $16.6 million \u2014 from longtime owner Kenneth Ringbloom, whose era is remembered for on-site maintenance and responsive management \u2014 conditions have deteriorated rapidly.\nThe Sausage King is now preparing to cut and run. Minority owner Robert Budman confirmed to WBEZ that the complex is being sold to another\nCalifornia developer\n, the Transcend Group, with closing expected by year-end. A prior financing application shows Transcend attempted to buy the property in 2023 for $27 million \u2014 a markup of more than $10 million over the 2017 sale price.\nChicago\u2019s City Council has already approved up to $31 million in loans for Transcend to rehabilitate apartments, upgrade common areas and enhance security. The firm has also requested additional HUD subsidies to support the rehab. But tenants worry about displacement and say trust has been eroded after years of neglect.\nThat comes after Indian Trails spent more than two years in building court for\nrepeated violations\n: failing heat and hot water, electrical issues, nonfunctioning fire safety equipment and plumbing failures. Tenants describe flooded basements, sewage leaks, rodent infestations and maintenance requests ignored for months.\nMultiple renovation plans announced by ownership never materialized, including two failed applications for state financing through the\nIllinois Housing Development Authority\n. The property cycled through managers before landing with a Conquest Housing affiliate, which residents and organizers say has been the least responsive yet.\nAdvocates warn the saga is emblematic of a broader business model in which investors extract HUD-backed rents while allowing buildings to decay.\nAs one organizer told the council, \u201cThe Sausage King is trying to cash out \u2026 If we don\u2019t talk about what happened, the Transcend Group becomes the next Sausage King.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The pace of commercial leasing was up 48.9 percent from the 13.7 million square feet that was leased in the second quarter.\nArtificial intelligence, unsurprisingly, is a big factor.\n\u201cAI is driving a lot of what\u2019s happening in Silicon Valley and San Francisco,\u201d Phil Mahoney, an executive vice chairman with Newmark, said. \u201c\nNvidia\n, Google,\nMeta\n, Microsoft and\nApple\nare all doing well, and that is great for the overall environment. You have the major companies, and you have the rising up of AI-funded growth companies.

Tenants who might have sat on their hands in recent years are now back on the hunt, some brokers say.\n\u201cTenants are out right now looking for real deals,\u201d Colliers executive vice president David Sandlin said.\n\u201cThe market is certainly more positive than it was two years ago,\u201d Newmark\u2019s Mahoney added. \u201cThere was a lot of momentum going into the election last year that was lost in the first quarter. But that momentum is now coming back.\u201d\nCommercial development, meanwhile, is also inching toward a comeback. About 5.6 million square feet of new space was delivered in the third quarter, up 5.5 percent from the 5.3 million square feet of completed development in the previous quarter. A newly built office building in San Jose\u2019s Santana Row has been among those new constructions drawing several leasing tenants.\nAt the same time, the market\u2019s scars are hard to miss. While office vacancies dipped slightly to 22.2 percent from a record high of 23 percent in the second quarter, they remain more than double pre-pandemic norms and above dot-com bust levels. Laboratory space, once viewed as a shining light in the commercial property sector after the pandemic, reached a 37 percent vacancy rate after a development boom far outpaced demand. Asking rents also slid 7 percent from last year, marking their lowest point in a decade.\nStill, the quarter saw positive net absorption, suggesting companies are taking slightly more space than they\u2019re giving back. Colliers\u2019 large-user pipeline, for example, has ballooned to 11 million square feet, up from 2 million during the pandemic.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

The buyer was a trio of firms: AM Management, Eyn Holding and Axonic Capital.\nThe deal for the 350,000-square-foot building \u2014 which closed on Tuesday night \u2014 breaks down to $380 per square foot. That\u2019s a 53 percent discount from the\n$282 million\n\u2014 and $800 per square foot \u2014 Clarion doled out to acquire the property from EQ Office in 2018.\nAt the time of the deal, which was financed with a $141 million loan from MetLife, the property was a darling of the TAMI tenant movement. Tenants included Roku, VTS and Guess. That financing is remaining in place under the incoming ownership.\nEastdil Secured\u2019s Gary Phillips, Will Silverman and Jeff Organisciak advised the seller. All involved companies either declined to comment or did not respond to requests to comment.\nThe century-old, 22-story building between Sixth Avenue and Broadway and West 40th and 41st Streets was renovated in 2015. Tenants include Quartet Health, AI platform Snowflake, Demandbase, MediaRadar and French bakery Maman, which occupies retail space at the building\u2019s base.\nDespite the conversion boom taking hold in Manhattan, there are no plans to turn the property into a residence.\nThis isn\u2019t the only tough situation Clarion is facing.\nThe developer and Alchemy Properties are in\ndanger of foreclosure\nat 209-211 East 43rd Street, a 24-story, 211,000-square-foot property only a block from Grand Central Terminal.

        "content": "Innovation districts anchored by universities are emerging as some of the strongest real estate hubs in California.\nOffice and retail assets inside these campus-linked clusters are outshining properties in the submarkets in which they\u2019re located, Globe Street\nreported\n, citing a new report from JLL. A total of 18 districts across the state tied to major research universities are commanding higher rents, lower vacancies and outsized investor interest as tenant demand consolidates around talent, walkability and lab-ready space.\nThe Stanford Research Park,\nUCLA\nInnovation Park, UC San Diego\u2019s Science Research Park and San Diego State\u2019s Mission Valley Innovation District are among the 18 college markets that have proven most resilient and promising, delivering higher rents and occupancy rates than nearby office and retail markets.\nOffice properties in these districts average a 10 percent rent premium and vacancy rates 220 basis points below the national norm, the JLL report says. Older innovation districts post an even sharper edge, with office asking rents running 36 percent above U.S. averages. And when looking at the surrounding metro areas of each of these communities, offices in the innovation districts fetch a 26 percent premium and maintain vacancy nearly 300 basis points lower than nearby submarkets.\nRetail is riding the same wave. Mixed-use developments in particular, such as properties with student-friendly food and services on floors below labs and research and development spaces, help activate these neighborhoods and boost performance. Retail rents in innovation districts are 28 percent higher than in surrounding areas, powered by high foot traffic from students, researchers and\nadjacent residential growth\n.\nUniversity-anchored innovation districts first emerged in the mid-20th century and grew in the 1950s and 1960s.\nStanford\nResearch Park, for example, now the epicenter of the research and development market in Silicon Valley, was founded in 1951. While districts such as these have become real estate hotspots across various sectors, they often spend many years working to reach that status.\n\u201cFostering the growth of such economic development engines takes time,\u201d Emily Crutcher, senior vice president for JLL\u2019s government and education division, told Globe Street. \u201cUniversity-anchored innovation districts may take decades to cultivate and grow, which requires committed university leadership across multiple administrations; the support of local, state and federal agencies; partnerships with corporations; exposure to\n[venture capital]\nnetworks; programs with local community colleges and more.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "One of Houston\u2019s busiest retail hubs is bracing for another overhaul as MetroNational tees up the redevelopment of Memorial City Mall, adding to the sweeping changes already reshaping the west Houston corridor.\nEarly filings with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation indicate that the owner plans to level about 216,000 square feet of interior space, relocate a mall entrance and carve out a new ground-floor lobby with tenant areas. The Houston Chronicle\nreported\nthat another 190,000 square feet outside the mall would come down to make room for a reworked parking layout and other site updates.\nThe project is expected to cost $8.8 million. Gensler is listed as the architect.\nMetroNational\nconfirmed the demolition will include portions of the old Sears wing but didn\u2019t specify which segments are on the chopping block. Sears was the mall\u2019s original anchor when it opened in 1966 and\nMetroNational\nrazed the main store building in 2020 after the chain shuttered the location two years earlier. Construction documents label the latest project \u201c400 Gessner\u2013North Site Phase 2,\u201d hinting that the work could land near the Cinemark theater. Temporary tenants, including kiosks and pop-ups, will be moved before the walls come down.\nWork is scheduled to start in May 2026. The parking-related improvements are expected to wrap by January 2027, with the broader redevelopment finishing that April. The landlord said it will release final details as plans take shape.\nThe mall revamp is separate from MetroNational\u2019s splashier 27-acre \u201ctown square\u201d proposal unveiled in 2022, which the company said remains under evaluation. Still, the amount of capital flowing into the area shows how aggressively MetroNational is repositioning its portfolio around Memorial City.\nAcross I-10, the firm teamed up with Radom Capital on\nGreenside\n, a 35,000-square-foot mixed-use project set to bring retail, restaurants, offices and wellness concepts online in 2026. And earlier this year, MetroNational snapped up the 309,000-square-foot retail component of CityCentre, one of the city\u2019s most trafficked open-air shopping districts, soon after acquiring the former\nMarathon Oil\ntower next door.\nTaken together, the project point to another wave of reinvestment in a submarket where retail density keeps climbing.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

What about if it turns out to be dirt itself?\nA San Francisco couple unknowingly bought an unpaved alleyway in the\nOuter Sunset\ndistrict after what they believed was a bargain purchase for a property at 1924-1926 Kirkham Street being auctioned off for as little as $1, Realtor.com\nreported\n.\nJ.J. Hollingsworth and Alemayehu Mergia, who lived next door, jumped on the opportunity to buy what they believed was a two-unit\nrental\nproperty that had sold for more than $1 million last December. The couple submitted a bid for $25,000 as well as an additional $8,000 for the transfer tax.\nWhen their transfer tax check was returned, they did more research and found that they had, in fact, not purchased the building at 1924-1926 Kirkham Street, but instead bought the 83-foot-long, 7-foot-wide unpaved alley between that property and their home. The property is officially listed as \u201cDirt Alley\u201d on\nGoogle Maps\n, though the couple has since taken to nicknaming it \u201cHollingsworth Alley.\u201d\nIt was a simple case of not reading the fine print. After closely re-reading a letter from the tax collector that initially notified them of the auction, they realized they missed several key pieces of information, including a note that the auction was for the sale of plots that had been \u201crendered unusable by their size, location or other conditions.\u201d\nBy the time they realized their mistake, the couple had already celebrated prematurely.\n\u201cIt was devastating,\u201d Hollingsworth\ntold\nCBS News. \u201cIt was absolutely devastating. We had already celebrated and told our friends. I went over and said, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m your landlord now. We\u2019re not going to kick you out or raise your rent.'\u201d\nTo make matters worse, the couple paid much more than any other bidder had offered in the auction. About half of the 47 plots in the sealed auction were sold, four for just $1; the rest sold for between $10 and $11,000, with the median sale price (omitting the couple\u2019s bid) being $435, the San Francisco Standard\nreported\n.\nMergia and Hollingsworth are now working to get their money back, though that would involve the\nBoard of Supervisors\nvoting to overturn the sale \u2014 something it\u2019s only done once in the past.\nThe tax collector\u2019s office, meanwhile, insists it communicated the nature of the property as clearly as possible.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The seller previously filed plans with the city to redevelop the property into 5,000 square feet of retail and office space, but the project is now off the table, according to Vizzda.\nAs of June, JPMorgan held $578 million in deposits at the Chase Alton Road branch, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\nThe banking giant also recently spent\n$53.7 million\nfor Shoppes at Heron Lakes, a 145,618-square-foot retail center in Coral Springs. The pair of single-story buildings sold for $369 per square foot. Tenants at Shoppes at Heron Lakes include Crunch Fitness, the Fish Joint, Lefty\u2019s Tavern &amp; Grille, Club Men Barbershop, Pasquale &amp; Son\u2019s Pizza Co. and Aldo Cleaners.\nShoppes at Heron Lakes traded for nearly $48 million more than its prior sale price two decades ago, reflecting continued investor confidence in South Florida\u2019s retail sector.\nIn other recent Miami Beach commercial trades,\nComras Company\n, led by Michael Comras, this month acquired a portfolio of Lincoln Road retail buildings for about\n$140 million\n, partially financed with a $117 million loan from San Francisco-based Acore Capital. Comras plans to renovate the properties into a 150,000-square-foot boutique shopping district called NoLi, which is short for North Lincoln Road.",

The firm was founded in 2013 by a group of former Oaktree Capital executives and is reported to manage about $5 billion in assets.\nGlendon joins previous investor\nLincoln Property Company\namong ownership and replaces Boston-based private equity firm Alcion Ventures as the primary investor in Flight. Lincoln Property will continue to serve as its property and asset manager of the 19-acre property.\nFlight is part of Tustin Legacy, a planned community in Tustin\nbeing developed\non the former Marine Corps Air Station Tustin.

        "content": "Garland\nis sketching out one of North Texas\u2019 biggest\nsuburban makeovers\n, drafting a long-range blueprint to transform Lake Ray Hubbard shoreline into a string of mixed-use projects.\nThe proposal to develop the 820-acre site could add more than $1 billion in taxable value to the northeast Dallas suburb over the next several decades, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. City staff presented \u201cSetting Sail: South Garland Lakeside Area Plan\u201d to the Garland Plan Commission late last month. Commissioners voted to advance the plan, setting up a Dec. 1 briefing with the City Council and a Dec. 16 vote. Approval would give staff the green light to begin rezoning the area.\nThe framework divides the site \u2014 a small peninsula stretching into the lake, spanning the Interstate 30 and State Highway 190 interchange, across the lake from the\nstrained Sapphire Bay development\nin Rowlett \u2014 into five districts, each with its own development strategy. The effort is driven in part by the future extension of the President George Bush Turnpike, which could wipe out several existing businesses and crack open redevelopment opportunities, according to planning director Nabila Nur.\nThe plan calls for long-term urban regeneration, such as a broader housing mix, better lakefront access, upgraded trails, and more community amenities. Some of the land is city-owned, but a patchwork of private parcels and already-developed sites will complicate how fast the pieces come together.\nOfficials estimate the full buildout could stretch 30 to 50 years.\nZion Point, the first focal area, is envisioned as a hub for new residential options alongside future retail and commercial development, adding an estimated $236 million in taxable value. Plans for North Point involve a lakefront commercial strip and improved connections to I-30 and Marvin Loving Road. That area could produce roughly $114 million in value.\nSouth Point, positioned as a town-center style subdistrict, could generate an estimated $254 million in potential value. Windsurf Bay, the area most in flux due to the turnpike extension, could either stay as-is or evolve into a recreation-anchored district with residential and educational uses, adding up to $307 million. The fifth node, Locust Grove, could generate about $103 million via mobility upgrades and higher-density residential or mixed-use development.\nThe lakefront redo is just one piece of Garland\u2019s redevelopment push. This summer the council\nrezoned 317 acres\nnorth of Interstate 635 for a dense, mixed-use community. Garland was poised to partner with Atl\u00e9tico Dallas on a\n$71 million soccer complex\n, but the city abruptly scrapped the deal in September.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher",

        "content": "The Town of Fairfax reluctantly greenlit a controversial apartment project after months of procedural reversals, political backlash and an election-season messaging war.\nFairfax officials granted conditional approval to\nMill Creek Residential\n\u2019s proposed six-story, 243-unit building at 95 Broadway, the Marin Independent Journal\nreported\n. The 1.9-acre site, known as School Street Plaza, will feature 41 income-restricted units for households earning up to 80 percent of\nMarin County\n\u2019s area median income.\nThe conditional go-ahead was characterized by resident opposition and even a recall election targeting Mayor Lisel Blash and Vice Mayor Stephanie Hellman.\nLocals derided the project\nfor its height, density and potential wildfire-evacuation implications. Blash and Hellman faced criticism for purportedly not doing enough to stop the project from moving forward.\nThe long road to approval came after a legal back and forth between town planning director Jeffrey Beiswenger and Mill Creek attorney Riley Hurd. Beiswenger initially told Mill Creek in July that the project didn\u2019t qualify for ministerial processing because it sat in a high-fire-severity zone and would displace tenants. He reversed course in September, though that didn\u2019t last long, as he issued a letter the following month listing 25 deficiencies with the project that brought it out of compliance. Mill Creek argued that the Town of Fairfax had passed its statutory deadline to act and that the development was already approved by operation of law.\nBlash and Hellman fired back, weeks before the recall election against them. \u201cLet\u2019s be crystal clear: Fairfax followed the law, and this project was not approved,\u201d Blash said. Hellman stated that \u201cFairfax has values, and we intend to uphold them.\u201d\nThe timing was convenient, and now Blash and Hellman have seemingly thrown their arms up, saying that denying the project could lead to bigger problems for the town down the line.\n\u201cCalifornia law imposes significant risk on local jurisdictions that deny housing projects. The Department of Housing and Community Development has issued a warning of revoking the town\u2019s housing element compliance related to this application. The risk of the\nunthinkable builder\u2019s remedy\nis very high should we lose our housing element certification,\u201d Hellman told the Independent Journal.\nUnder its approved\nhousing element\n, the Town of Fairfax must zone for 490 new units of housing by 2031.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The last decade has seen New York City\u2019s luxury market overtaken by its biggest rivals.\nA\nreport from Redfin\nshows how the Big Apple\u2019s market has stood stagnant in the last decade as prices in the Sun Belt and South Florida surged.\nBetween October 2015 and October 2025, luxury home prices in New York have hardly budged, rising just 15 percent in the same time period to $4.1 million. The market notched the smallest growth among major metropolitan areas, followed by Houston with over 49 percent luxury price growth.\nOn the leaderboard were West Palm Beach and Miami, where prices grew by over 187 percent and 148 percent to hit just over $4 million and $4.3 million, respectively.\nThe Sunshine State\u2019s ascent among the country\u2019s top luxury markets has been well-documented, riding a wealth migration sparked first by the 2017 tax regulation changes and exacerbated during the pandemic supported a wave of activity and a boom in new development.\n\u201cThe luxury market has expanded far beyond its traditional boundaries,\u201d\u00a0 Redfin\u2019s Head of Economic Research, Chen Zhao, said in a statement. \u201cThe priciest homes used to be more concentrated in a smaller number of East and West Coast metros. Today, high-end wealth is increasingly distributed across the Sun Belt \u2014 from Florida to Texas to Arizona.\u201d\nThe discrepancy in growth rates could be a sign that the luxury market across the five boroughs is just more mature \u2014 it didn\u2019t have the same growth potential because prices had already hit a reasonable ceiling.\nBut other metrics included in the report indicate that market maturity isn\u2019t the only explanation. In the platform\u2019s rankings of luxury markets, New York fell from No. 2 in 2015 to No. 6 in 2025, slipping behind San Francisco, which claimed the top spot in both years, Los Angeles and Miami.\n\u201cNew York\u2019s luxury housing market was already cooling before the pandemic as new taxes on high-priced homes and a flood of new condo developments tempered demand,\u201d the report explains. \u201cWhen the pandemic hit, that slowdown deepened as wealthy buyers fled the city for larger suburban or Sun Belt homes and foreign investment dried up.\u201d\nDespite its 10-year downward trend, the city could be\npreparing for a rebound\n, if last month\u2019s deal prices are any indication. Luxury home prices rose 10 percent in October compared to the same month last year.\nNot so fast\u2026\nAlexander Zakharin,\na broker and real estate content creator\n, is the newest addition to a team at Ryan Serhant\u2019s eponymous brokerage.\nZakharin, who counts roughly 1 million followers across his Instagram, TikTok and YouTube accounts, has joined a team led by Nile Lundgren, a broker who was featured on the first season of Netflix\u2019s \u201cOwning Manhattan.\u201d\nBefore teaming up with Lundgren, Zakharin was an agent with Compass for just six months after a two-and-a-half-year stint with Nest Seekers, the brokerage where Serhant began his real estate career.\nLundgren is bringing on a new team member just in time for the premiere of the\nsecond season\nof \u201cOwning Manhattan,\u201d which follows Serhant and brokers with his firm. The show\u2019s eight episodes will be available starting Friday, Dec. 5.\nEarlier this month, the streaming service released a sneak peek of the season, which featured a new cast member, Serhant\u2019s Peter Zaitzeff, who heads sales at some of the city\u2019s buzziest new developments such as Naftali\u2019s Williamsburg Wharf.\nPreviously with Corcoran\n, Zaitzeff was also one of agents behind a $60 million deal for a penthouse at 150 Charles, which set the record for the most expensive condo ever sold in Downtown Manhattan.\nInside a New York courtroom\u2026\nDisgraced brokers Tal and Oren Alexander and their brother, Alon Alexander, were back\nin a New York federal courtroom\nthis week, ahead of their sex trafficking trial set to begin in January.\nTheir appearance came days after prosecutors dropped a fourth indictment against the trio, adding a new charge accusing Oren of sexually exploiting a minor in 2009. In total, the government has brought 11 charges against one or more of the brothers.\nThe latest indictment also broadened the scope of the conspiracy charge. Prosecutors now claim the alleged \u201csex trafficking scheme\u201d stretched from 2008 to 2021, pushing the start date back by a year.\nDefense attorneys on Monday pushed back against the government\u2019s proposed witness list, which included 17 alleged victims whose accounts don\u2019t form the basis of standalone charges but would instead be used to support the conspiracy count or a history of alleged sexual assault.\nTwo of those victims were taken off the list, and United States District Judge Valerie E. Caproni said that while prosecutors can choose how to pare down their case, she won\u2019t allow all of the remaining witnesses to take the stand during the trial.\nThe brothers are due back in court on Tuesday, when Caproni will hear arguments over whether the newly added charge against Oren should be separated from the rest \u2014 a response to the defense\u2019s argument that it came too close to trial \u2014 and the inclusion of certain expert witnesses.\n",

        "content": "Two of New York\u2019s most prominent multifamily landlords have been hit with two foreclosure suits targeting their portfolios.\nLenders filed for foreclosure on two portfolios connected to investors Peter Hungerford and Arthur Haruvi. The portfolios together comprise 31 multifamily buildings in Manhattan. Entities associated with Hungerford and Haruvi took out a total of $173.4 million in loans against the two portfolios, but didn\u2019t pay them back by their June maturity date.\nHungerford said he was \u201cshocked\u201d the lenders filed the suits, saying the investors were in the midst of negotiating mezzanine financing and an extension to the loans.\n\u201cI can\u2019t comprehend why they chose to do this,\u201d Hungerford said. \u201cI hope we can come up with a reasonable agreement to push forward with the extension and the mezz agreement that we\u2019d already fully negotiated.\u201d\nRialto Capital Advisors, a special servicer associated with the plaintiffs on one of the cases, has gained a reputation for using\nscorched-earth tactics on a number of borrowers\n,\nThe Real Deal\nreported earlier this year. The servicer has previously maintained it is playing by the rules and only goes after borrowers in \u201crare instances.\u201d An attorney for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe investors have been ready to refinance the portfolio Rialto was servicing, Hungerford said, but family legal disputes have gotten in the way. In 2022, Haruvi reorganized the family assets. He\nbrought in Hungerford\nto take on a stake and manage the portfolio. But Michelle Haruvi, Arthur Haruvi\u2019s daughter, sued her father and Hungerford, alleging she had been unfairly cut out of the family companies. The case was\ninitially dismissed\nbut\nrevived on appeal\n. Arthur Haruvi could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\u201cI, as the sponsor and manager of this deal, have done an excellent job managing the properties and improving the condition of the properties,\u201d Hungerford said.\u2029\u201dBut because of the family disputes, we\u2019ve been unable to refinance.\u201d\nHungerford and Haruvi are named as defendants in the suits because they served as limited guarantors on the loans. The lenders are seeking judgments to collect at least some losses from Hungerford and Haruvi personally if portfolio sales don\u2019t cover the debt, alleging the two are liable because the borrower failed to make certain deposits. Hungerford, however, said the property is worth more than the loan.\nThe investors\u2019 Midtown West portfolio, serviced by Rialto, comprises 18 buildings in the blocks between West 54th and 57th streets, and between Eighth and Tenth avenues on the West Side. The other portfolio is made up of 13 buildings across the Upper East Side, Upper West Side and Murray Hill. Notes on the two portfolios, which include rent-stabilized units, were both transferred to the plaintiffs in February.\nHungerford has become one of the city\u2019s most well-known multifamily landlords for his strategy of\nbuying up rent-stabilized buildings\n. The buildings have been considered deteriorating assets by many in the industry after statewide legislation made it harder to raise the rents in regulated apartments. With buildings selling at a fraction of their peak prices, investors like Hungerford have swooped in, believing they can hold on long enough to make a profit.\n",

        "content": "Billionaire Larry Ellison is set to take over more than just Paramount from Shari Redstone.\nThe founder and former CEO of Oracle bought two units from trusts tied to Redstone and her late father, Sumner Redstone, at the Pierre Hotel for $24 million, according to public records.\nSkydance Media, run by Ellison\u2019s son David Ellison, acquired Paramount parent company National Amusements for over $8 billion in a deal that closed earlier this year. The elder Ellison was later reported to be replacing Shari as the media giant\u2019s largest shareholder.\nThe wealthy families have apparently continued their wheeling and dealing. Ellison purchased Unit 2508 for $10.1 million and Unit 2501 for $13.9 million with the same trust that is taking control of Paramount\u2019s licensed television broadcast stations. Both deals appear to have occurred off-market.\nEllison has apparently not been scared off by the recent controversy swirling around the hotel, which includes private units for purchase.\nResidents at 795 Fifth Avenue\nsued the co-op board earlier this month over a proposed $2 billion sale\nof the building that they claim would have them vacate their apartments and lose their share of the proceeds.\nThe complaint claims the co-op board struck a term sheet in September with an unidentified LLC allegedly tied to the Khashoggi family, which would fold the building into the Brunei-owned Dorchester Collection.\nThe uproar included high-profile owners like fashion designer Tory Burch, a named plaintiff, against United States Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, who bought the penthouse for $44 million in 2017 and\nallegedly helped prepare the building for a sale\n.\nOpened in 1930, J. Paul Getty bought the Pierre eight years later and turned it into a cooperative in 1959. In 2005, the building underwent a $100 million renovation and now serves as a luxury hotel with private homes.\nResidents complaining of deteriorating maintenance and services hasn\u2019t stopped high-profile buyers from staking a claim in the historic building.\nIn March, former Disney chief executive officer Michael Eisner bought a $4.3 million apartment. In a sign of its waning value, Eisner paid the same price the seller bought it for in 2004.\nBeyond dropping $8 billion for the media company, Ellison has been on a bit of a buying spree himself. Earlier this week, an entity tied to the Larry Ellison Foundation\npaid $30 million for a 254-acre wildlife park in Palm Beach.\nLast year, Ellison also bought an eight-acre oceanfront resort in Manalapan, Fla. for over $277 million following his $173 million purchase of an estate in the same wealthy enclave in 2022.\n",

        "content": "Real estate players\u00a0 in and around New York are finding reasons to be thankful this holiday season.\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James is thankful after U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie\ndismissed\nthe mortgage fraud case against her on Monday. The judge ruled that the prosecutor in the case, Lindsey Halligan, was illegally appointed by the Justice Department.\nThe case (as well as James Comey\u2019s) was thrown out without prejudice, meaning it could be revived. The path for refiling is unclear, however, as the DOJ\u2019s prosecutor was ruled ineligible to bring the indictments again.\nA federal grand jury\nindicted\nJames last month. Allegations included marking on a mortgage application that a house she and her niece bought in Virginia would be a primary residence, misrepresenting the number of units at a row house in Fort Greene, Brooklyn and falsifying documents to secure better mortgage terms.\nJames\u2019 legal team argued the case was part of a \u201cpolitical retribution campaign.\u201d\nHundreds of city influencers are thankful to be part of mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani\u2019s transition team. That includes\ntwo dozen people\non his transition committee for housing.\nThe housing group includes nonprofit housing organizations, union reps, YIMBY groups, religious leaders, tenant groups, private real estate developers and multifamily lenders. Representatives from the private sector include Real Estate Board of New York Chair and Two Trees Management CEO Jed Walentas, L+M CEO Lisa Gomez and M Squared COO Carolee Fink.\nMembers of the committee also include veterans of the de Blasio and Bloomberg administrations. Notably, The Partnership for New York\u2019s Kathy Wylde is on another committee and five representatives from the Democratic Socialists of America were named to different committees.\nAbramson Brothers is thankful for the\n467m tax incentive program\n, which offers property tax breaks to owners converting office buildings into apartments.\nAbramson is\nconverting\nits 90,000-square-foot office building at 333 West 52nd Street in Hell\u2019s Kitchen into a 108-unit residential property; architecture firm CetraRuddy is leading the redesign.\nThis represents the longtime office landlord\u2019s first office-to-residential conversion. Amenities will include a fitness center and a terrace.\nUnfortunately, not everyone is thankful these days. Turkeys, for one, probably aren\u2019t loving this holiday, nor are air traffic controllers.\nThe same could be said for brokers and owners\nfearful of a bill\nworking its way through the city.\nThe Community Opportunity to Purchase Act is a proposed measure that would grant city-approved nonprofits first dibs to buy buildings with three or more residential units.\nOpponents, including brokers and property owners, are not pleased, arguing the bill will \u201cdisrupt the city\u2019s housing market,\u201d bring transactions to a crawl, deter investors and lenders due to delayed closings and preclude time-sensitive 1031 exchanges.\nProponents, however, are gobbling it up, saying COPA will curb speculation and help nonprofits create and preserve affordable housing for low-income tenants.\nIt\u2019s a fight that doesn\u2019t appear likely to be settled at the Thanksgiving table.\n",

(He later served as dean of the Yale School of Architecture from 1998 to 2016.)\nHe founded\nRobert A.M. Stern Architects\nin 1969, and shaped the firm with an emphasis on incorporating architectural history and\n\u201cthe complexities of place.\u201d\nThe New York-based firm was behind commercial and civic projects, but made its mark in history with a rare combination of commercial and design acclaim at\n15 Central Park West\n.\nThe luxury residential building developed by Arthur and William Lie Zeckendorf known as the most successful condominium in New York City history. Dubbed \u201cLimestone Jesus\u201d for its facade\u2019s distinct nod to prewar grandeur, the property attracted buyers including celebrities and Manhattan power players who sold the building out before it completed construction.\nThe firm designed 15 Central Park West, the limestone condominium where total sales topped $2 billion, making it the most successful apartment building in the world.\nElsewhere in Manhattan, the firm made its mark on the luxury market with the\nSuperior Ink Condominiums in the West Village\n,\n30 Park Place in Lower Manhattan\nand\nthe Chatham on the Upper East Side\n, where Stern was a resident until his death.\nOutside of New York City, the firm was also behind a number of commercial projects, including Philadelphia\u2019s Comcast Center skyscraper, residential colleges at Yale University and the George W. Bush Presidential Library in Dallas, Texas.\nStern\u2019s work has been the subject of 20 books and included in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Paris\u2019 Centre Pompidou, among others, according to a bio on his firm\u2019s website.\nOn the subject of being deemed a \u201cstarchitect,\u201d he told\nTRD\nin 2009 that he would differentiate the \u201cstar status\u201d of certain architects from the acclaim awarded most movie stars.\n\u201cWe\u2019re much more interesting than movie stars and much more important, and what we do is much more enduring,\u201d Stern said.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like the movie you\u2019re watching, you can turn it off or walk out of the theater, or fall asleep. I do all of those things. But if it\u2019s a building and it\u2019s across the street from your window and it\u2019s an abomination, what are you going to do about it? Not much.\u201d",

        "content": "The classic Soho loft drama begins in the 1970s with artists moving into buildings that no one else wants.\nThen the neighborhood gentrifies, and the artists battle real estate professionals trying to oust them from properties that have become extremely valuable.\nThat story is playing out at 36 Greene Street, but with an ironic twist: The holdout renter, Alexander Riguardi, isn\u2019t a peer of\nPatti Smith\nbut a commercial real estate broker who arrived five years ago. The landlords seeking to oust him were the original tenants.\nRiguardi is the son of Peter Riguardi, JLL\u2019s New York region chairman and president. His landlords are Antonio Morello and\nDonato Savoie\n\u2014 the founding architects of\nStudio MORSA\n\u2014 and artist\nTheodosius \u201cTed\u201d Victoria\n. They purchased the five-story, five-unit building in 1977 from the estate of Westchester landlord Anna Donovan.\nCity records show they paid $75,000. Today it would sell for about $15 million.\nBut only if they can get Riguardi out.\nHumble beginnings\nThe three men had scratched together $27,000 in the late 1970s and got a mortgage from the seller for the $48,000 balance. Victoria, the artist, who was less than a decade into what has been a 60-year career, signed for the buyers. Their monthly payment was $379.\nFive years later, in 1982, the state\npassed the Loft Law\n, allowing owners of Soho lofts to collect rent while converting them to legal residences. The law also locked in low rents for tenants, but let landlords deregulate units if they could buy out the occupants.\nSoho at the time was a gritty, even dangerous industrial area. No one anticipated that it would become among the most coveted neighborhoods in the city, or that the Loft Law would spur intense, protracted landlord-tenant disputes and a cottage industry of lawyers.\nOne reason was that the statute allows tenants to pay little or no rent until the owner gets a certificate of occupancy and gives them tools to stall the process for years. They can challenge renovation plans and submit their own, using delay as leverage to maximize buyouts.\nLoft owners, if they can get through these headaches, also have the potential to make a killing. Soaring demand to live in Soho, which has supercharged rents, pushed owners to create as many free-market units as possible.\nThe three owners of 36 Greene Street avoided this madness, in part because they were their own tenants. Morello and Victoria registered 36 Greene Street in February 1983 with the newly created Loft Board, triggering a timeline for them to get the building up to code and obtain a certificate of occupancy. Savoie amended the filing that September.\nAfter that, things went sideways. One year ran into the next without the owners doing the renovations and paperwork needed to get a residential certificate of occupancy.\nIn 1996, they had a brush with disaster: The building was pulled into the city\u2019s tax lien sale. It was released a year later, and in 1999, the owners finished paying their $48,000 mortgage.\nIn 1982 and again in 2000, their ownership entity was dissolved, suggesting disagreements among the three partners. Each dissolution was later annulled, state records show.\nOne problem lingered: The owners, despite having two architects and a successful artist among them, never legalized the building.\nIn 2006, the Loft Board brought a case against 36 Greene for being out of compliance with the Multiple Dwelling Law. The owners settled the case in 2007, paying a $10,000 fine and agreeing to a new legalization timeline \u2014 which they did not meet.\nMost surprisingly, the owners apparently did not realize the risk of renting Apartment 3 to Alex Riguardi in 2020. Tenants are famously well protected by New York laws, and none more so than those in regulated loft apartments.\nRiguardi\u2019s unit spanned the entire third floor of the elegant brick building at the corner of Grand Street \u2014 prime Soho. Morello had the young broker pay half the $7,250 rent to him and the other half to the LLC that owned the building.\nThe lease provided the landlords an immediate revenue boost, but would come back to haunt them.\nThe holdout\nRiguardi was nothing like the original tenants of 36 Greene Street or other starving artists of 1970s Soho, a raw neighborhood that had lost its manufacturers to the scourge of deindustrialization.\nAs a Michigan State freshman in 2014, he and two classmates had\ncreated an app\nto drive inebriated Hamptons and Jersey Shore partiers home. The effort earned them a feature story in the New York Post but petered out a couple of years later. Riguardi\u2019s road to riches, like his father\u2019s, would be in real estate, albeit by a route he never expected.\nRiguardi began his career in traditional fashion for kids who can tap into a parent\u2019s network. He landed summer analyst positions in 2016 and 2017 at JPMorgan and Tishman Speyer, the kind of gigs that are much easier to get if you have connections.\nAlex\u2019s father certainly had connections. Peter had followed his own father into the business at GVA Williams Real Estate in 1983, co-founding what would become Colliers International in 1994 and joining JLL in 2002.\nAlex joined his father\u2019s firm upon graduating in 2018 and had been promoted twice by the time he leased the full-floor unit at 36 Greene Street from Morello.\nThis was late 2020, when the market was still reeling from Covid, and Morello was not convinced that the 24-year-old could pay the $7,250 rent on his own. Riguardi, however, had something that Soho tenants of the 1970s lacked: a wealthy father to guarantee the lease. Dad hand-wrote his address on the agreement as 212 Fifth Avenue, a Nomad condominium where units\nfetch more than $10 million\n.\nNine months later, his son would purchase a summer home, nabbing a four-bedroom, three-bathroom house with a\nheated pool\non 1.3 acres in East Hampton. Alex Riguardi paid\n$1.65 million\nfor a property that today would fetch nearly $2.2 million, according to Trulia.\nRiguardi had no idea that his Soho lease would soon be worth more than that. The deal with Morello, unbeknownst to its signatories, was a golden ticket. The only question was when it could be cashed in.\nThe answer came late last year when the owners decided to punch their own ticket.\nTime to sell\nThe three men, now in their 70s or 80s, had watched their building appreciate more than they could possibly have imagined. It had 69 feet of frontage on Greene Street and 20 on Grand Avenue, four full-floor apartments and a ground-floor commercial space in one of the city\u2019s richest retail corridors.\nExcept for the fact that one or more of them still live in the building, there was no reason to wait any longer. It was time to sell.\nThey hoped to find a condo developer who would pay $15 million or more, but to get that price, they would need to deliver the building empty. That meant Riguardi had to go. Morello served him with the required 90-day notice that his lease would not be renewed.\nRiguardi\u2019s experience was in commercial real estate, not tenants\u2019 rights, so he did not initially realize the tremendous leverage he enjoyed. But he knew enough to consult a knowledgeable attorney, something Morello apparently failed to do before leasing the unit.\nRiguardi\u2019s lawyer, Gregory Byrnes, had his client apply to the Loft Board for status as a protected loft tenant, an obscure but enormously consequential designation. The application was dated Feb. 28, the final day of Riguardi\u2019s lease.\nIf granted, it would entitle the silver-spooned JLL broker with the Hamptons house to stay in his $8,400 apartment for just a few hundred dollars a month. Eat your heart out, Zohran Mamdani.\nBecause the owners had never bought out a previous occupant of the third floor, they cannot charge its tenant anywhere close to what Riguardi was paying. Instead, it would be what the unit went for when the building was registered in the 1980s, plus three increases totaling 20 percent.\nThe new rent might be $600 or less, according to people familiar with the situation. Riguardi has asked the Loft Board to come up with a number.\nThen, after the building gets a certificate of occupancy, Apartment 3 would become rent-stabilized, subject only to the minimal increases allowed each year by the Rent Guidelines Board. Riguardi and his descendants could, in theory, remain in the low-rent unit for the rest of this century, forcing a developer to work around them.\nRent-free living\nTechnically, Riguardi can live there rent-free until the owners legalize the building, because the owners missed the deadline to do so. Protected-rent status would also entitle Riguardi to claw back about 95 percent of the approximately $450,000 he has paid his landlords.\nThe owners, who belatedly tapped Loft Law attorney Michael Bobick to represent them, have challenged Riguardi\u2019s application for protected status. Their filing notes that he arrived 38 years after the Loft Law took effect and did not provide proof of rent payments or that 36 Greene Street was his primary residence. The non-renewal notice, they say, establishes that Riguardi no longer resides in the building with the owners\u2019 consent.\nThe Loft Board is not likely to be persuaded.\nAlthough loft tenants\u2019 protections were geared for 1980s occupants in unfinished buildings, not trust-fund kids paying $8,400 a month, Riguardi appears to qualify. That would entitle him to reimbursement for rent overcharges, and more importantly, the right to stay in Apartment 3.\nAs a legal occupant, Riguardi could drag out the legalization for years \u2014 something loft tenants have mastered by objecting to landlords\u2019 renovation plans. As a commercial broker for a publicly traded brokerage, it might not be in his professional interest to do so, but the potential is there.\nThe owners of 36 Greene Street would have to start virtually from scratch because, after registering the building as a loft, they never registered any tenants or filed a narrative describing how they would bring it up to code.\nThe lawyers for both sides declined to comment.\nThe owners have no interest in keeping Riguardi in place, but did ask what it would take to buy him out. He came back with a number close to $4 million. It\u2019s a bitter pill that the owners don\u2019t want to swallow.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fundamentally unfair for who he is,\u201d said one person familiar with the situation, calling it \u201clegal extortion.\u201d\nBut the key word is \u201clegal.\u201d\nAt first blush, it does seem unfair that the folks who nurtured a building for half a century, from near worthlessness to trophy status, must now cede millions of dollars of their gain to a five-year tenant who comes from money.\nAnd it certainly makes no sense that someone who, on his own free will, has been paying $8,400 a month should have his rent reset to $600 based on what people paid in 1983.\nOn the other hand, real estate operates by rules, no matter how arcane. Had the owners followed them, none of this would have happened. Savoie, Morello and Victoria never took the basic step of registering Riguardi or other tenants, if there were any.\n\u201cI can\u2019t for the life of me figure out why someone didn\u2019t give them guidance \u2026 to make sure their paperwork was all in order,\u201d said one real estate executive.\nBecause the building is in a residential zone, R7X, they had another option as well: \u201cAt any point in the 40 years, they could have \u2026 deregistered it with Loft Board and gotten a residential C of O,\u201d the executive said.\nThese were not naive newcomers, but grizzled New Yorkers and longtime Soho residents. Two were architects \u2014 partners with three decades of experience. They had plenty of time to legalize their building and no tenants standing in their way.\nUntil now.\n",

        "content": "When the value of real estate in Chicago\u2019s Loop dropped by more than $129 million this year, it wasn\u2019t just landlords who felt it \u2014 it was\nevery homeowner across the city\n.\nThe latest report by Cook County Treasurer Maria Pappas \u2014 who recently announced she\u2019s\nrunning for Chicago mayor\n\u2014 confirmed what insiders already knew: commercial property tax breaks ricochet straight into residential mailboxes, helping push the median city homeowner\u2019s bill up 16.7 percent to a record $4,457.\nThis isn\u2019t a bug in the system. It is the system \u2014 and it\u2019s built to shift the load from the connected to the common. As commercial property owners\nleveraged appeals\ntied to legitimate net income losses and skyrocketing vacancies, residential owners, especially in neighborhoods with little to no commercial tax base, absorbed the blow. South and West Side communities, already under pressure, saw\nmedian bills climb more than 80 percent\nin places like Englewood and North Lawndale.\n\u201cThe steepest increases show up on the South and Southwest sides because those neighborhoods simply do not have enough commercial property to absorb the shift,\u201d said Justin McLelland, a property tax appeals analyst who studies Cook County and offers a software platform called AppealZoo. \u201cWhen the central business district loses hundreds of millions in taxable value, the places with thin commercial footprints feel it the most.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not to say the cuts to assessed values on offices in the Loop and across Cook County granted through appeals to the Board of Review aren\u2019t based on the evidence. They\nlargely are\n, said McLelland.\n\u201cSome major owners still lead with optimistic underwriting instead of actual results. That worked a few years ago, but today the difference between pro forma and reality is too wide,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the numbers do not line up with market conditions, the appeal will not hold.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s not just the boardroom towers that skew the system. Look at the\nNorth Shore\u2019s lakefront\n. In Winnetka,\nJeffrey and Ashley Quicksilver\nrecently sold their home at 609 Sheridan Road for a record-setting $32.5 million \u2014 even as the property\u2019s assessed value sat below $15 million. Still, the power couple appealed the valuation to the Cook County Board of Review in the most recent tax cycles and, to the board\u2019s credit, lost, records show.\nYet the Quicksilvers have also taken the extra step of trying their case with the\nIllinois Property Tax Appeal Board\n, even drawing public opposition from the New Trier High School district before withdrawing their appeal, records show.\nThat\u2019s not nothing. Though many homeowners wouldn\u2019t consider a PTAB appeal, Mr. Quicksilver isn\u2019t most homeowners \u2014 he\u2019s a commercial real estate executive at\nWalton Street Capital\nwith the kind of institutional fluency and leverage that can make a difference in how the government responds to requests.\nWhile it looks like tax authorities held firm on this lakefront mansion\u2019s share of the pie, it\u2019s easy to see how deep-pocketed insiders can test every angle of the system, even when they\u2019re already paying taxes on less than half their sale price.\nMeanwhile, average homeowners are still grappling with delayed tax bills and\nreopened appeals windows across northern Cook County\n\u2014 fallout from sticker shock and the sluggish reassessment process.\nDespite rhetoric about reform, the county\u2019s valuation tug-of-war between\nAssessor Fritz Kaegi\u2019s\nmodeling and the\nBoard of Review\u2019s\ncase-by-case corrections leaves room for well-positioned players to exploit gray areas. And state lawmakers, content to fund schools and services by loading up real estate with taxes, continue to rely on a system that feeds on inequity.\n\u201cA lot of people jump straight to the racial framing, but I do not think the system is sitting around trying to target anyone,\u201d McClelland said. \u201cWhat is really happening is that the neighborhoods hit the hardest tend to be places with fewer businesses, more disinvestment and weaker commercial corridors. Those areas also happen to be predominantly Black and Latino. The outcome has a racial pattern, but the mechanism is really about commercial density.\u201d\nAdd insider access and luxury property blind spots to that, and it\u2019s no wonder the math keeps crushing those without a lobbyist or diverse portfolio.\n",

At least the state\u2019s also trying to do its part in boosting California\u2019s affordable housing supply.\nGov. Gavin Newsom said Friday six more affordable housing developments will turn\nsurplus\n, state-owned real estate more\nproductive\n.\nCentral and inland California will be the biggest beneficiaries: Atascadero, Napa, Fontana, San Bernardino and Stockton will see repurposed properties once operated by the Department of Motor Vehicles, Department of State Hospitals and Department of General Services.\nAt least 850 units are slated for development, the vast majority affordable with one or two market-rate homes at each.\nTenants will be under a lease option agreement, which offers the chance to purchase the unit at the end of a specific term.\nWhat\u2019s in it for developers? An approval process of less than five months.\nA total of 10 additional sites are currently available and accepting developer proposals in places such as Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara, Marin and Sacramento counties, according to the state\u2019s portal.\nWhy does any of this matter? For starters, Newsom and California Attorney General Rob Bonta have been on a tear in recent years, making affordable housing production one of their major missions with policy and enforcement working hand in hand.\nThe industry\u2019s already seen this in places such as Huntington Beach,\nBeverly Hills\nand\nLa Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge\nwhere cities with housing elements unapproved by the state\u2019s Department of Housing &amp; Community Development get swept up in litigation and exposed to builder\u2019s remedy provisions.\nNewport Beach density pushback\nA new question has emerged in the housing tussle between the state and some local governments.\nThat is, what happens when voters attempt to reject the housing element, the state-mandated long-term housing plans cities must create lest they want to jostle with the attorney general or a builder\u2019s remedy push? Newport Beach is buckling up to find out in what could turn out to be a wild ride.\nResidents obtained enough signatures to move a measure onto the ballot next year that would zone for 2,900 new homes instead of the city\u2019s\noriginal plans\nfor more than 8,000, as reported by the\nVoice of OC\n.\nThis could place the city in a precarious situation with the state. It also represents a new twist in the state vs. local tug-of-war playing out through housing development. That is, how the state mandate can coexist with zoning or voter-approved measures. Or can it?\nHousing a lynchpin for mayoral victory?\nThe housing conversation at the state and local levels comes as a new mayoral hopeful with a history in housing advocacy enters the race in Los Angeles.\nRae Chen Huang\nis a long-time housing and tenant rights activist who has publicly spoken on the merits of social housing and turning underutilized public land into residences for low- to moderate-income households.\nThat\u2019s a big part of what\u2019s known of the Democratic Socialists of America member\u2019s public-facing stance.\nHuang is deputy director of Housing Now! California, which backed legislation forcing the completion of a social housing study that would offer a long-term strategy for how to boost such supply. Senate Bill 555 became law in 2023, with the study expected to be completed by 2027 and create a framework for as many as 1.2 million to 1.4 million more housing units.\nWho\u2019s poaching who\nIn brokerage news, local recruiting\u2019s been quiet the past few months. Chalk it up to a holiday slowdown.\nStill,\nColdwell Banker Realty\nmade a big splash this week with the announcement that its Beverly Hills office recruited five new agents under newly appointed branch manager Matthew Clayman. That\u2019s a big win for Clayman, who took on the top spot leading the Beverly Hills and Hancock Park offices. He\nsucceeded\nColdwell Banker veteran Tom Dunlap in August.\nAnother two agents also jumped to Coldwell Banker, but declined to be named publicly. The seven combined had production of more than $150 million over the past 12 months.\nThose who joined the Beverly Hills office include Severin Braham, Hannah Babitt, Katy Johnson, Mary Swanson and Myles Lewis.\n",

        "content": "The headlines out of San Francisco\u2019s commercial and office market this year tell the story of a boom or bust city once again striking gold. Time will tell whether the energy around artificial intelligence will prove to be fool\u2019s gold; but in the interim the growing ecosystem of AI startups is flush with venture capital cash and populating long-vacant office spaces throughout the city.\nAs we\u2019ve reported, those office spaces are increasingly of the trophy, Class A variety. Such a flight to quality often leaves the city\u2019s older, Class B and C office stock increasingly vacant. In the short-term, this tanks values; in the long term, it creates an opportunity for investors willing to trade some risk for a good deal on an old building.\nSilicon Valley-based neurosurgeon and investor Dr. Reza Malek ran into one of these opportunities recently. Ramosa LLC, a company tied to his name, dropped $6.8 million to purchase the International Order of Odd Fellows Temple in San Francisco\u2019s MidMarket neighborhood. The property, at the corner of Market and 7th streets, has belonged to the fraternal order since 1880. The Odd Fellows built the existing six-story, 48,000-square-foot building in 1909, a few years after demolishing the previous structure to slow the spread of the fire that engulfed the city following the 1906 earthquake.\nThe property\nhad been on the market since 2023\n,\u00a0 right around the time the CVS occupying the ground floor had closed its doors and social issues such as crime and drug use had consumed the area. In its most recent chapter, the building had become a magnet for artists and studios, and maintains a handful of tenants, including renowned San Francisco artist Richard Perri, and the contemporary ballet company Alonzo King Lines Ballet.\nAnother San Francisco landmark made headlines this week as film director Francis Ford Coppola works to get his financial house back in order.\nAccording to documents filed with the San Francisco assessor-recorder\u2019s office,\nCoppola has put up his Sentinel Building as collateral to guarantee a new private loan\n. Situated in the North Beach neighborhood, the seven-story, patina green structure is modeled after Manhattan\u2019s Flat Iron Building and stands as one of San Francisco\u2019s most recognizable facades. Coppola bought the building in 1973 for $500,000. The building had been the headquarters of Coppola\u2019s production company, American Zoetrope, and has long-hosted the eponymous eatery, Cafe Zoetrope, on the ground floor.\nAccording to the documents, Coppola has taken out the loan with Capital Holdings VI LLC. Neither the amount, or the purpose of the loan, are disclosed in the documents. However, if Coppola defaults on the loan, Capital Holdings VI has the right to take over the Sentinel Building as landlord.\nCoppola has used the structure as collateral at least twice in the past, including in 1998 to take out a $1.5 million loan with First Republic Bank.\nThe director\u2019s recent money problems have been well-documented. After self-financing last year\u2019s \u201cMegalopolis\u201d for $120 million, the film grossed less than $15 million. Since then, Coppola has off-loaded his island in Belize, and has plans to sell seven watches next month, one which is expected to fetch north of $1 million.\n\u201cI need to get some money to keep the ship afloat,\u201d he told the New York Times last month.\nJust a few blocks southeast from where one of the cinema\u2019s elder statesmen is betting with one of the city\u2019s landmarks from its cherished past, a nonprofit CEO is taking a political bet on downtown San Francisco\u2019s future.\nAs the top executive for the Downtown San Francisco Partnership, Robbie Silver oversees day-to-day operations funded by the money the community benefit district collects from downtown property owners. The district, which largely funds sanitation and safety initiatives in the neighborhood, was formed in 2020 by a vote of property owners and includes Jackson Square and the Financial District. Those boundaries are set until 2034, but Silver is planning to force a vote next year in the hopes of expanding the district to include the area around the Embarcadero Center.\nIn an interview\nwith the San Francisco Business Times\n, Silver likened the move to \u201ca Hail Mary pass\u201d that, if successful, would make for \u201cpotentially the largest special assessment district in California.\u201d However, the move involves some risk. Property owners won\u2019t be deciding between the current boundaries and the expanded boundaries. By forcing a vote eight years early, the Downtown San Francisco Partnership will essentially be starting anew. That means, for the property owners voting on the expansion, the decision will be between all or nothing.\n",

        "content": "The Dallas real estate community is grieving the loss of a visionary who helped bring \u201c\nY\u2019all Street\n\u201d to life.\nColin Fitzgibbons\n, president of Hunt Realty Investments,\ndied\nat 46 on Nov. 21 of colon cancer. He is survived by his wife Jessica and their three sons, Patrick, Conor and Declan.\nAt the time of his death, he was years into spearheading the development of NorthEnd, a mixed-use community at 2323 North Field Street that will be home to Goldman Sachs\u2019 new Dallas campus. The 11-acre \u201curban arboretum\u201d is a critical element of an upcoming wave of investment that promises to make Uptown into a financial hub that rivals Wall Street.\nFitzgibbons grew up in Dallas but spent five years living in New York\u2019s Financial District while working at the Staubach Company, followed by nearly a decade at KDC working on high-profile projects like Legacy West. He was quick to give his understanding of what drew people to each city and worked to highlight Dallas\u2019 sometimes invisible perks.\n\u201cDeep down, there\u2019s an understanding that there\u2019s no reason for Dallas to really exist,\u201d he told The Real Deal in 2024 for a story on the upcoming developments that will form Y\u2019all Street.\n\u201cDallas is very business-friendly, and that\u2019s sort of been our reason for being. But the underpinnings of all that is, look, this has to be a great place to build a career and to raise a family. I think that\u2019s the secret sauce.\u201d\nFitzgibbons saw NorthEnd as a development that would embody the future of office space. He took that vision seriously and talked about his team\u2019s research into projects around the world to create the best possible development. He was also clear-eyed about what it means to be \u201cpro-business\u201d in a conservative state and advised leaders not to rely solely on the state\u2019s lack of income tax to maintain Texas\u2019 pro-business identity.\nA self-described \u201ccheerleader\u201d for Dallas, Fitzgibbons was optimistic about the city and city life in general, predicting that projects like NorthEnd could help make Uptown a truly urban slice of Dallas where residents and people who work there get around on foot or by public transit \u2014 a rarity for North Texas communities.\nPerhaps most importantly, he saw Dallas as a city that\u2019s still in the process of being molded and seemed to live by the idea that, if you want to see change, you can make it happen.\n\u201cOne of the things I love about Dallas is you can get involved so easily,\u201d he said during that 2024 interview.\nLow lows for Austin housing market\nThe tech boomtown\u2019s star has fallen almost as quickly as it rose. Austin notched the\nsteepest annual drops in price and financing activity\namong markets with at least 1 million residents in the last 12 months, according to\nTRDData\n. The median home sale price in the Texas capital region fell by 8.2 percent year-over- year to $416,000. The national median climbed by 4.8 percent to $375,000. Mortgage activity in Austin also bucked national trends.\nPurchase loan originations tumbled by almost 41 percent in the third quarter compared with a year before. Purchase mortgage originations dropped nationally in the third quarter as well, but just by 6.6 percent year over year, per Attom.\nForeclosures don\u2019t faze Ari Rastegar\nReal estate investor and CEO of Rastegar Capital\nAri Rastegar could lose four Austin apartment buildings\nat a foreclosure auction on Tuesday, but he isn\u2019t sweating it. The Austin multifamily market is so frozen that foreclosure has become another outlet to exit a deal, he said. He sang the same tune at an\nevent\nThe Real Deal and his firm put on in Downtown Austin in October.\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t sell them *#!ing kick the keys back,\u201d he said this week.\nRastegar said the foreclosure is the result of a \u201cknock-down, drag-out fight with the lender.\u201d Greystone provided the $22.7 million loan for Hyde Park Square, a 48-unit complex at 206 West 38th Street; Sunset Palms, a 36-unit complex at 902 Romeria Drive; The Chateau, a 30-unit complex at 1211 West 8th Street; and The Highlander, a 49-unit complex at 803-809 Tirado Street.\nWhite Rock Lake home buyer is Bush subject\nIf you\u2019re familiar with the artistic stylings of former President George W. Bush, you might recognize the\nbuyer of 4231 West Lawther Drive\non White Rock Lake. Entrepreneur Mark Haidar is a Lebanese refugee born in Kuwait and also the subject of a portrait painted by Bush, featured in his book, \u201cOut of Many, One: Portraits of America\u2019s Immigrants.\u201d The 9,140-square-foot home sits on a 3.7-acre lot and was most recently listed for $10.9 million.\n",

        "content": "LaSalle Partners\u2019 first ever hotel bet was the Montrose.\nIn late November, Pebblebrook Hotel Trust, which acquired LaSalle Hotel Properties for billions of dollars after battling Blackstone, announced it dumped the 133-key, West Hollywood hotel, with a \u201ctrailing 12-month financial performance.\u201d\nThe roughly $44 million trade of the boutique hotel at 900 Hammond Street, near Sunset Boulevard, amounts to about $333,000 a room.\nThat is nowhere near a\nrecord trade\n, but a sale is a sale in an area such as Los Angeles where\nhoteliers\nare defaulting on debt and facing forced sales \u2014 and the real estate investment trust\u2019s latest strategy is selling hotels and repurchasing shares at discount.\n\u201cL.A. is a difficult market to sell in today due to unfriendly government policies and the lagging impact from the fires, strikes, ICE, National Guard,\u201d Jon Bortz, Pebblebrook chairman and chief executive, said. Measure ULA, or the so-called \u201cmansion tax,\u201d doesn\u2019t help either, but West Hollywood commercial deals are exempt. Another issue, the perception that homelessness is rampant, contributes to declining tourism, and therefore revenues.\n\u201cWe were very happy to find an interested buyer. We were not specifically marketing the hotel. The buyer approached us,\u201d Bortz said in an email.\nThe company did not disclose the buyer, but a person familiar said it is a high-net-worth individual who has roots in Los Angeles, believes in its future and loves buying all kinds of real estate at discounts. There are at least a couple people who fit that description.\nSeparately, the publicly traded company said it has another other hotel under contract at a sales price of $72 million, but was vague on details.\nAll kinds of pain\nThere\u2019s Los Angeles hotel pain, and then there\u2019s Los Angeles office pain.\nCarlton Plaza, a 155,000-square-foot, brick and black glass office building located in the Valley\u2019s Woodland Hills neighborhood, is on the auction block. The auction was scheduled for Nov. 24 but was postponed to Dec. 22. It was the special servicer that requested a postponement, according to Prestige Default Services.\nCarlton Plaza owner Peregrine Realty Partners owes lenders about $24 million, records reveal.\nThe debt was originated by JP Morgan, packaged with other commercial property debts and sold off to investors.\nThe property, at 20750 Ventura Boulevard, is only worth $12 million, according to Morningstar Credit, but in pre-pandemic 2018, it was valued at $35 million. The property is 71 percent occupied, the most recent available data shows. (Offices in Woodland Hills have a 22 percent vacancy rate, versus 20 percent in the Valley.).\nPeregrine Realty Partners\u2019 principals did not respond to a request for comment.\nMore on Rexford\nLast column\n, the industrial real estate investment trust announced a chief executive shakeup and teased an announcement of an independent board member (all post-Elliott Investment Management stake). That happened sooner than anticipated. Rexford appointed David Stockert to the company\u2019s board of directors, effective Jan. 1. He\u2019ll serve on the board\u2019s audit committee.\nStockert is a general partner of Sweetwater Opportunity Funds, a series of private real estate investment funds. He has held executive and senior roles at other REITs such as Post Properties, Weeks Corporation and Duke Realty, which was acquired by Prologis.\nRexford\u2019s latest proxy reveals the non-employee director compensation program includes a $100,000 annual cash retainer and $150,000 annual restricted stock award \u2014 and because he\u2019ll be an audit committee member he\u2019ll get another $20,000 in cash.\nBusy, busy Beverly Hills\nA lease, a buy and development happened in the ritzy enclave of Beverly Hills.\nUnited Talent Agency\nrenewed\nits 192,000-square-foot headquarters lease at the plaza that shares its name at 9336 to 9346 Civic Center Drive; Alo Yoga\ndropped\n$90 million for headquarters at 8942 Wilshire Boulevard, which came out to more than $1,000 a square foot; and Cain\u2019s $10 billion One Beverly Hills went vertical.\n",

Brazilian authorities allege the Rio de Janeiro-based bank created fake credit operations that were then sold to Banco de Bras\u00edlia SA, as part of a multibillion-dollar fraud. Officials arrested Vorcaro on Nov. 18 as part of their investigation into the bank.\nVorcaro, who is dating fitness and fashion influencer Martha Graeff, is\nlinked to the ownership\nof at least two condos and two homes in Miami, acquired between 2023 and early 2025, according to sources and property records. He was living the high life, often sporting Rolex or Patek Philippe watches, dining at top restaurants, flying private and hosting elaborate parties, Bloomberg reports.\nVorcaro\u2019s biggest purchase in Miami is the 20,500-square-foot mansion at 4445 and 4425 Sabal Palm Road in Miami\u2019s gated Bay Point neighborhood. A Delaware LLC paid $85.2 million for the waterfront estate in January, a record for Bay Point. A month later, the same LLC paid $6.9 million for the non-waterfront house across the street at 4430 Sabal Palm Road.\nConstruction is underway on the waterfront house \u2014 a demolition permit was issued in August, and permits for new construction were issued in September. The 1.7-acre lot has 400 feet of bay frontage and two docks.\nIf he is charged and convicted, it\u2019s unknown what would happen to the Miami properties, which also include a condo at Asia on Brickell Key and a penthouse at Missoni Baia in Edgewater. Vorcaro was still in custody as of Wednesday.\nBanco Master has another Miami connection. Last year, it leased 26,000 square feet at 830 Brickell in Miami for $190 per square foot in rent, a record for Florida. That office is now empty.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nMiami Art Week starts on Monday. We\u2019ll have a story on how the real estate industry plans to court buyers this week.

        "content": "The Alexander brothers are headed to trial.\nFormer star brokers Oren and Tal, and their brother Alon have spent the last year in jail, after they were forced to trade their waterfront mansions and an apartment on New York\u2019s Billionaires\u2019 Row for Brooklyn\u2019s Metropolitan Detention Center.\nSince being arrested in Miami early one December 2024 morning, the brothers have been in limbo, awaiting a verdict on the federal charges that took shape after years of rumors and whispered allegations gave way to a crush of lawsuits and investigations.\nBut the months of uncertainty are nearing an end: their long-anticipated trial before a judge and jury in the Southern District of New York is slated to commence on Jan. 5.\nThe stakes are high. The trial will deliver answers for the brothers, who are facing a minimum of 15 years in prison, and their family. But it is also hugely significant for women who say they have been drugged, sexually assaulted or raped by one of more of the brothers, some while they were minors. Beyond the attacks, some women allege the brothers have for decades used their wealth, extensive networks and played the women against each other to suppress the allegations.\nCourt filings in recent months have raised the curtain on the Alexanders\u2019 all-out defense strategy, the arguments they\u2019ll be raising in court and how the judge is preparing to hear the case.\nAll three brothers have denied the allegations.\nT\nhe allegations\nProsecutors have expanded the sex trafficking case against the three brothers since the indictment was first unsealed a year ago. The latest indictment, revealed in late November, brings the number of charges to 11.\nProsecutors accuse Tal, Oren and Alon of participating in a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking, including working together to \u201crepeatedly and violently drug, sexually assault, and rape dozens of female victims\u201d between 2008 and 2021. The indictment alleges the brothers, \u201ctogether and with others,\u201d perpetrated the scheme by inviting women to travel and stay in luxury destinations, where they were ultimately attacked.\nIn a pre-trial motion filed in November, prosecutors cited group chats where the Alexanders and other men traded graphic photos and videos of women, discussed \u201chunts\u201d and \u201ckills\u201d as they outlined the logistics for women to join them on trips, like one to Tulum. Prosecutors say in one message, Oren talks about trying \u201cludes\u201d \u2014 shorthand for quaaludes, a drug prosecutors say the brothers had on hand \u2014 along with Xanax, MDMA and GHB, to incapacitate women.\nAside from the conspiracy charge, Oren, Tal and Alon are also facing three counts of sex trafficking and one count of inducement to travel to engage in unlawful sexual activity. Alon and Tal are charged with sex trafficking a minor victim, while Oren and Alon are charged with aggravated sexual abuse. Tal is also on the hook for two additional sex trafficking charges and another count of inducement. Oren faces a sexual exploitation of a minor charge,\nbrought\nby prosecutors in a fourth superseding indictment in November.\nWhen they were arrested last year, the twins were also charged alongside their alleged accomplice, family friend Ohad Fisherman, with sexual battery by Miami-Dade\u2019s State Attorney\u2019s Office. The state dropped the charge against Fisherman earlier this year over evidence tied to the timeline of the alleged attack. Lawyers for Oren and Alon claimed this as a win in their effort to poke holes in prosecutors\u2019 arguments and shape public perception of the case.\nBut the federal trial is a significant upscaling of the allegations aired in Miami court, with more victims and purported evidence. And the brothers have doubled down on their defense strategy.\nOren brought on attorneys Marc Agnifilo and Teny Geragos, who were dubbed the \u201cdream team\u201d after representing Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs against sex trafficking charges for which he was acquitted. The Alexander family hired crisis communications expert Juda Engelmayer, who also represented Diddy, and counts fraudster Anna Delvey and Harvey Weinstein among his client roster.\nThe team has largely sought to discredit accusers, accusing women of seeking financial gain by bringing allegations, and to get cases\ndismissed\nbased on time-barred claims. (One civil lawsuit against Tal was dismissed in January under those terms. Plaintiff Angelica Parker vowed to appeal.)\n\u201cFor years, a partial and often inaccurate public narrative has been built on allegations that were never proven, some of which have already been dismissed or withdrawn,\u201d a spokesperson for the Alexanders said in a statement. \u201cThe government\u2019s latest motions repeat those same disputed claims, stripped of context, and presented as if they were established fact. They are not.\u201d\n(Ed. note: The brothers filed a defamation lawsuit against The Real Deal, seeking $500 million in damages.)\nN\new details emerge\nProsecutors have indicated that a crucial tenet of their case lies in disturbing video evidence of alleged sexual assaults, obtained when authorities searched Tal\u2019s apartment at 432 Park Avenue in early January 2025.\nOne video recorded in 2009 shows Oren allegedly sexually assaulting another person who appears to be \u201cseverely intoxicated and incapacitated.\u201d During the alleged assault, Oren moved her body and had sex with the victim, who \u201cdid not actively participate,\u201d according to the filing.\n\u201cWhen the victim spoke, her words were so badly slurred that it is difficult to understand what she is saying, making clear that she was too incapacitated to consent to any sexual activity,\u201d prosecutors say.\nThe pretrial motion laid bare a new raft of details around the allegations included in the charges Oren, Tal and Alon will face at trial, including multiple victims who were minors when they were allegedly attacked by one or more of the brothers.\nThe accounts, which range in detail, add to what prosecutors say was a common pattern.\nProsecutors have described other instances in which women say they started feeling strange after accepting drinks from the brothers, in some cases losing consciousness, and then being raped by one or more of the brothers, along with other men.\n\u201cAs much as defendants want to characterize the charged conduct as just men behaving badly, this is not what the indictment charges. The charges are that three grown men conspired to entice women and girls to travel in interstate foreign commerce, to provide things of value to those women and girls, and to use force and drugs in order to have sexual contact with those victims.\u201d\nJudge Valerie E. Caproni\nThe earliest allegation prosecutors included in a recent filing is from 2009, when women invited to celebrate Oren and Alon\u2019s birthday were brought from Manhattan to the Hamptons by a party bus. After arriving at a rental house, one of the women says she was given a drink by Alon while in a hot tub. The drink made her feel tired, and Alon held her down in the hot tub and raped her as she told him to stop, prosecutors allege. The same night, the woman saw Tal having sex with a woman who was crying.\nOne of the more detailed allegations centers on a woman who says she met Tal on Instagram before he invited her and a friend to the Hamptons in 2014. He allegedly told the woman that he would reimburse flights for her and her friend and book them a hotel room, only for them to end up in a waterfront mansion with Oren and two friends, given a room with a door that did not lock. The next night, the woman says she noticed her friend \u201cbegan acting erratically\u201d after consuming half of a glass of wine.\nShe took her friend to their room, where she piled luggage to block the door. But Tal came in, jumped on the bed and asked if she had been drinking. She said yes, even though she had not, and Tal left. Too nervous to sleep, she again tried to block the door with luggage and stayed awake. A couple of hours later, two men who she believed were Tal and Oren entered. When the woman asked them, \u201cCan I help you,\u201d she heard one of them say, \u201cOh shit,\u201d before they left, according to prosecutors.\nEarly the next morning, they were packing to leave when Tal came into their room. The woman says Tal, upset she was leaving, tackled her onto the bed, and she pushed him off. But his demeanor shifted, and he became angry. He chased her into the bathroom, where she says he cornered her in the shower and raped her.\nShe says she tried to scream but couldn\u2019t raise her voice and instead whispered \u201cno, no, no.\u201d As he left her crying in the shower, he repeated \u201cYou wanted that,\u201d and \u201cI care about you.\u201d\nT\nhe Alexanders\u2019 new A-Team\nAs their legal battle forges on, the Alexander family has put on a united front \u2014 for the most part.\nTheir parents, Orly and Shlomy, have been fixtures at hearings in New York and Miami and a driving force in determining the brothers\u2019 next legal moves. They have publicly stood by their sons as others previously in their inner circles tried to distance themselves from the family.\nTal\u2019s estranged wife, Arielle Alexander, alleged in court documents that Shlomy and Orly \u201cchanged on a dime\u201d when they found out she\u2019d filed to divorce Tal, despite her assurances that she wanted to separate \u201camicably and quietly.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I told [Orly], she was not understanding,\u201d Arielle claimed in court documents. Orly \u201ctold me I should be standing by my husband, and questioned my morals, among other disrespectful statements she made to me.\u201d\nArielle also alleged the Alexanders\u2019 parents \u201cbegan to terrorize, harass and scare me, acting as their son\u2019s agent and proxy from federal prison.\u201d She accused Shlomy and Orly of barging into the Billionaires\u2019 Row apartment she previously shared with Tal and stealing multiple watches, wines and other luxury goods, along with $50,000 in cash that belonged to Arielle.\nAfter their sons\u2019 arrest in December, Shlomy and Orly appeared prepared to throw the entirety of their wealth in a bid to secure their release on house arrest \u2014 a request federal judges have repeatedly denied, citing prosecutors\u2019 arguments that they pose a flight risk and danger to the community.\nAt the time, the parents suggested their assets, combined with those of their sons, were worth about $1 billion. The family assets include Shlomy and Orly\u2019s waterfront home in Bal Harbour, the office building where their security company, Kent Security, is headquartered, plus homes in Israel and the Bahamas. The family also owns a 48-acre ranch near Aspen, Colorado.\nAs legal bills pile up, Shlomy has tried to sell\nsome of his sons\u2019 properties\n. In June, the family\nsold\nthe waterfront Miami Beach mansion where Oren lived with his wife, Kamila Hansen Alexander, before his arrest. A hidden buyer paid about $52 million for the 10,000-square-foot home. Orly signed the deed on Oren\u2019s behalf.\nThe family also tried to offload another Miami Beach property earlier this year, this one belonging to an LLC tied to Alon. The property at 969 West 34th Street, a planned Alexander Group development, hit the market in February asking $2.2 million, though it was pulled about six months later without finding a buyer, according to a Realtor.com listing. Another waterfront home was listed for rent.\nThe brothers\u2019 in-court circle appeared to expand for a November hearing to include Gil Neuman, Orly\u2019s brother and a fellow executive at the family\u2019s Kent Security firm; Alon\u2019s wife, Shani Alexander; and their oldest brother, Niv Alexander, who hadn\u2019t been spotted at previous hearings.\nAt the hearing, Judge Valerie E. Caproni raised the possibility of pushing the trial to May if outstanding issues aren\u2019t resolved before the Jan. 5 trial date. Her warning sparked an outburst from Niv, who was seated behind his parents, uncle and sister-in-law.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not funny, it isn\u2019t,\u201d Niv said, shaking his head in an apparent response to the potential delay.\nCourtroom security and a U.S. Marshal came over to quiet Niv, warning him and his parents that they would have to leave if they continued speaking while the judge was in the room.\nT\nrial comes into focus\nIn a decision issued in November, Caproni cleared the way for prosecutors to take the sex trafficking case to trial, rejecting most of the defense\u2019s bid to dismiss the charges. She did, however, order prosecutors to drop attempted sex trafficking from one of the charges as the statute of limitations on the 2009 allegation had already expired.\nIn her decision, Caproni pushed back on several claims from the defense, including attorneys\u2019 attempts to frame the charges as, at best, state-level \u201cdate rape.\u201d\n\u201cAs much as defendants want to characterize the charged conduct as just men behaving badly, this is not what the indictment charges,\u201d Caproni stated. \u201cThe charges are that three grown men conspired to entice women and girls to travel in interstate foreign commerce, to provide things of value to those women and girls, and to use force and drugs in order to have sexual contact with those victims.\u201d\nShe added that the indictment \u201cis not charging sexual assaults that serendipitously occurred when a group of 20- to 30-somethings [went] on vacation and one side of the romantic equation fund[ed] part of the vacation.\u201d\nShe also rejected core arguments from the defense that have come up in previous hearings, including that prosecutors\u2019 interpretation of the \u201canything of value\u201d portion of the sex trafficking statute is too broad.\n\u201cTo the extent the Defendants argue that \u2018there is no cash for sex,\u2019\u201d Caproni wrote, \u201ctheir argument is irrelevant.\u201d",

        "content": "At the party in Ibiza, Alex Sapir looked happy.\nIt was six months before he and his girlfriend, Leila Ben Khalifa, welcomed their daughter, and they were surrounded by their friends, models and Burning Man enthusiasts in fringe and crowns.\nFrom appearances, the question of his dwindling real estate portfolio was not on Sapir\u2019s mind that night in July of 2023. In a photo since removed from her Instagram carousel, Ben Khalifa is grinning, her head turned toward Sapir. He wears a block-printed cardigan tunic and a smile more mild than hers.\n\u201cMy heart is full of joy and gratitude remembering this magical night,\u201d Ben Khalifa posted when she shared images of the event a month later.\nSapir had been dealing with problems for years. These included a divorce from his wife, Yanina (initiated three years earlier, and ongoing), as well as\ntax liabilities\nand\nfamily feuds\nin the business he inherited from his father, Tamir Sapir, a Georgian immigrant who\u2019d famously gone from driving a cab to owning Manhattan properties like\n11 Madison Avenue\n, 100 Church Street and 50 Murray Street.\nBut at the time of the party, the scion seemed to be on a new path, living between Paris with\nBen Khalifa\nand Miami, where he had a\nsuccessful project in Arte Surfside\n, a luxury boutique condo development. Early comers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner had helped draw buyers, and all the units were sold. In New York, he had a long-term tenant at 2 Broadway, an office building his father bought in 1995 that is leased to the Metropolitan Transit Authority until 2048.\nYet issues started mounting again, personally and with the properties. He is now selling off three of his last remaining properties in New York and South Florida, suggesting that under his leadership, the family\u2019s property play may no longer be a generational one.\nSapir declined to be interviewed for this story and only provided a brief statement through a spokesperson. He is still dealing with his contentious divorce, and sources say he split with Ben Khalifa, who has edited her Instagram page in what appears to be an attempt to downplay their relationship: altering captions and removing some images of him.\nTwo of the properties \u2014 the Nomo Soho at 9 Crosby Street and a development site in Miami \u2014 are owned by his troubled company,\nSapir Corp\n, which Israeli bondholders are coming after for $155 million in debt. He\u2019s also parted with one valuable asset,\n260 Madison Avenue\n, which had been owned by the 35-year-old family real estate company, Sapir Organization.\nSo far he is holding onto the nearby office building at\n261 Madison\n, possibly for a condo conversion.\nH\nospitality play\nSapir Corp\u2019s unraveling has been years in the making, and the story of its collapse runs straight through the ivy-covered entrance of the Nomo Soho hotel.\nSapir and fashion executive Gerard Guez scooped up the 264-key boutique hotel in 2015 for $200 million at a foreclosure sale, paying a premium for a trophy property in a hot submarket. For a while, the bet looked savvy. By 2017, Israeli stock-exchange filings valued the hotel at $246.3 million. A year later, Sapir bought out most of Guez\u2019s stake, bringing Sapir Corp\u2019s ownership to 99 percent. In 2019, Goldman Sachs provided a $115 million refinancing.\nThen the bottom fell out.\nCovid hammered the hotel, sending occupancy to 1.9 percent in April 2020 and forcing Sapir to pour in his own capital just to keep operations going. He never invested in upgrades, and the hotel\u2019s condition deteriorated. The valuation dipped to $179 million. Sapir took out an $89 million Israeli bond-market loan in 2022 that replaced the Goldman Sachs mortgage.\nMeanwhile, debts mounted and the property continued to bleed cash. Sapir Corp cut management fees and quietly shopped the hotel last year, but never found a buyer.\n\u201cThey actually injected a huge amount in the company and its assets.\u201d\nAlon Binyamini, one of the trustees overseeing Sapir Corp\u2019s liquidation\nThis summer, the company was scrambling for extensions as debt obligations came due. Sapir agreed to inject $14 million of his own capital to postpone the maturity date. But as the initial July 1 payment approached, Sapir informed bondholders he wouldn\u2019t be able to cover it, triggering a default.\nSapir Corp entered insolvency proceedings, telling a Tel Aviv court that it could no longer meet bond payments or cover basic operating costs. All of its directors resigned, and several trustees are now overseeing the wind-down of the firm, which has just two remaining assets: Nomo Soho and the Miami site, a 1.5-acre assemblage in Edgewater, near Wynwood, which Sapir and his partners relisted in July for $41 million, though Sapir said the asking price was closer to $50 million.\n\u201cThey actually injected a huge amount in the company and its assets,\u201d Alon Binyamini, one of the trustees overseeing the liquidation, said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a typical insolvent company where we see that the controlling shareholder took money from the company. I don\u2019t think this is the case. They were the opposite.\u201d\nSapir Corp placed Nomo Soho into bankruptcy and will run a court-supervised auction of the hotel to pay down the company\u2019s remaining $155 million in\ndebt\nacross two Israeli bond series. It has lined up Israeli hospitality chain Dan Hotels to purchase the property for $125 million. If no higher bidder emerges, Dan will be the new owner of a property once seen as the crown jewel of Sapir\u2019s portfolio.\n\u201cFacing the ongoing challenges in the market and slow recovery from two years of Covid, during which the operation was supported with significant equity, we chose to support a process that is the most likely to result in the full payment of the debt to the bond holders,\u201d a Sapir spokesperson said.\nThe liquidation may not be the end of the saga. The bondholders can still go after Sapir personally for the $14 million he promised them.\nT\nwin trophies\nA few blocks south of Grand Central, 260 and 261 Madison Avenue flank the street like walls of a glass-and-metal canyon. The pair of 1950s-era buildings were trophy holdings of the Sapir empire for nearly three decades, though the company struggled on and off with its 1 million square feet of office space.\nAlex is now parting ways with half the pair. Tamir bought both in 1997.\nThe Sapir Organization in October struck a deal to sell the 22-story, 570,000-square-foot 260 Madison Avenue to Jonathan Bennett\u2019s AmTrustRE for $270 million.\nSapir will hold onto 261 Madison \u2014 the taller of the two, with a more pronounced, set-back tower section.\nAt 261, a strap lifting a heavy heating and air conditioning unit in 2015 snapped and damaged the building, which caused the property\u2019s CMBS loan to be watchlisted by its servicer. The loan was flagged again in 2019 due to increasing operating expenses caused by climbing real estate taxes and repair-and-maintenance costs.\nIt was watchlisted one last time in 2022 ahead of its June maturity date. Sapir refinanced the properties at the end of the year with a $326 million loan from JPMorgan Chase and Mack Real Estate Group.\nThe law firm McLaughlin &amp; Stern and the executive Solomon-Page Group lease 260 Madison, and 261 is where the Sapir Organization has its office.\nBut there have been challenges with other tenants.\nThe short-term office provider Knotel (which Sapir had invested in as part of a $70 million funding round in 2018) took 45,000 square feet at 261 Madison Avenue through a management deal that year. But Knotel filed for bankruptcy in 2021, and it\u2019s not clear what\u2019s come of the space.\nWeWork also signed a lease in the building for 44,000 square feet in 2012, but by 2021 Sapir claimed the company stopped paying its rent. Sapir sued the co-working firm and its controversial co-founder Adam Neumann for $17 million, saying he only learned that WeWork planned to walk away from its lease when he read about it in The Real Deal.\nThe 261 Madison location was one of the leases WeWork rejected when it went through its own bankruptcy in 2023, and the two sides settled their lawsuit this past September. The space is now occupied by Industrious.\nThe building, 28 stories and 384,000 square feet, is the one sources said the company may convert into residential condos, although no plans have been finalized. Sapir Organization notes on its website that it expects to expand the Arte brand he launched in Surfside, with potential projects in the U.S., Europe and the Middle East, per the company website.\nThe resort-style, oceanfront Surfside development, a 12-story, 16-unit building where the Trump-Kushners rented an apartment, sold out for a combined $225 million in 2023. While the project was seen as a success, Sapir is still dealing with a lawsuit brought by billionaire buyer Ramzi Musallam alleging construction defects in his penthouse. A trial is set for next summer.\nSapir doesn\u2019t appear to have plans for another Miami project.\nR\nags and riches\nTamir Sapir was the classic American rags-to-riches story.\nA refugee from the former Soviet republic of Georgia, he immigrated to New York in 1976 and scratched out a living as a yellow cab driver before he parlayed his Soviet contacts into lucrative fertilizer and oil contracts and, eventually, invested in real estate.\nIn 2003 he bought the 30-story Art Deco office tower at 11 Madison Avenue for $675 million, followed by the Duke Semans Mansion on the Upper East Side for $44 million in 2006.\nHis net worth peaked at $2 billion in 2007. By 2010, when Forbes profiled him, he had fallen off their billionaire\u2019s list and was worth about $700 million, or perhaps less. Alex was already at the helm, and in a lawsuit brought by a Las Vegas partner, he claimed the firm was $250 million in debt.\nTamir seemed to indicate he had stepped back.\n\u201cMy son is doing the business,\u201d Tamir said in court, per Forbes. \u201c\u2018Papa, give me money,\u2019 and that\u2019s it. I am the money man. Why am I expected to know so much?\u201d\nWhen Tamir died in 2014, his family was left with a huge tax bill.\nTamir was survived by his first wife, Bella, and their three children, Alex, Ruth and Zina. With his second wife, Elana, he had a daughter, Zita, and a son, Eli, who was born after his death.\nThe estate paid the Internal Revenue Service $153 million in 2015 and 2018, but late last year Alex filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking a $92 million refund on those payments.\nAlex said in the lawsuit that the estate had been unable to claim deductions for several pending claims against it. One of those was a $102 million claim bought by Rotem Rosen, who was married to Zina for 12 years before they divorced in 2019.\nRosen said he was owed money for his role in selling 11 Madison Avenue and Tribeca House, at 50 Murray Street and 53 Park Place.\nSapir and Rosen settled their suit in 2022, and in court papers Alex wrote that the rest of the claims were settled in 2024.\nHe said the estate had filed for a refund claim in April, but heard nothing from the IRS.\n\u201cThe Estate is being strained with maturities of its term debt and other cash flow requirements which cannot be addressed until the refund is received,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis imposes a severe hardship on the estate and is causing it financial injury and injury to its reputation and credit rating as a result of the IRS\u2019s unexcused delay.\u201d\n\u201cThe injuries are increasing daily.\u201d\nThe case is ongoing. Between the bills, suits, sales and remaining holdings, it is difficult to get an overall financial picture of Sapir Organization.\nL\nife of parties\nThroughout, Sapir seemed to find some separation from the drama in the courts and the buildings. He got into hospitality ventures with Rosen; both were part of a group that brought Zuma, a restaurant hotspot in 261 Madison, and the viral \u201cSalt Bae\u201d steakhouse to New York.\nHe also seemed in his element at Burning Man, where he was affiliated with a group called Monkey Camp. Photos from its account show him there with his wife in 2020. Later, he went with Ben Khalifa, and he\u2019s pictured in a pair of elaborately patterned harem pants, two braids in his beard. He\u2019s often seen wearing layers of necklaces including one that holds his vape.\nDuring the past two years with Ben Khalifa, a model and businesswoman, he attended splashier events: the Met Gala, Cannes Film Festival and Art Basel.\nHe continues to shed properties. Sapir\u2019s divorce from Yanina is still pending more than three years after she filed, and the estranged couple has one major asset left to sell: their waterfront Venetian Islands estate in Miami Beach, which is asking $38 million.Earlier this year, they sold their adjacent waterfront home on the Venetians to Shark Tank investor Rohan Oza for $9.8 million. The 60,000-square-foot home on 8 acres on the waterfront in Great Neck\u2019s King Point owned by his father has also been on the market, listed for as high as $100 million, though more recently for $45 million.\nPartying and personal trouble don\u2019t disqualify anyone from real estate, and without Sapir\u2019s responses, it\u2019s hard to know where his luck ran out and where his skill, or drive, didn\u2019t pick up.\nBut according to his spokesperson, the family business \u2014 Sapir Organization \u2014 isn\u2019t going away, despite the troubles with Sapir Corp.\n\u201cGiven that Sapir Corp was focused on a few assets for some of the Sapir family members and never owned by the Sapir Organization or part of its legal structure, Sapir Organization will continue operations as it always has for 3.5 decades,\u201d the Sapir spokesperson said.",

        "content": "Things were not good for multifamily investor Patrick Carroll \u2014 that much the industry knew.\nHis volatility had been so public. He\u2019d fired guns from his boat and reamed out employees at car dealerships and restaurants. Then, two days before the Fourth of July in 2024, a Los Angeles news chopper caught him on camera fleeing from the police. After years of unstable behavior, this was his first clear step into the abyss. Footage from the chase shows a phalanx of officers swarming a tall man in an unbuttoned light-colored shirt and dark slacks. The cops had pulled him over and pursued him down an embankment near a Los Angeles highway. Carroll pretended to surrender, but then just took off.\nWhen they finally caught him, police officers reportedly found two discarded weapons, a machete and a gun.\nCarroll\nhas been one of the country\u2019s most successful multifamily syndicators since the 2010s. Self-made, not only did he lack family wealth, but he hadn\u2019t even gone to college. His path had not been smooth: There\nwere\narrests, lawsuits, restraining orders and a messy divorce, and in retrospect, the particulars of these cases anticipated what happened later. But by buying into the Sun Belt boom early, he\u2019d managed to do $9 billion in transactions by age 40.\nIn 2023, he seemed to reach an apex, selling his Atlanta-based namesake firm, Carroll Organization, to RMR Group for\n$80 million\n.\nOn the other side of the sale lay a bleak period.\n\u201cBeing in retirement, having nothing to do, sitting in my pool in Miami was not good for me,\u201d Carroll said in an interview with The Real Deal publisher Amir Korangy at the\n2025 Miami Real Estate Forum\nlast month. Since the sale to RMR, he\u2019s been adhering to a non-compete agreement, which expires on Jan. 1, 2027. It forced him to the sidelines in business. But his mind was going a million miles an hour, he said.\nIn March of 2024, just nine months after the RMR deal, he \u201cwent into a full-blown manic attack,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd frankly, there\u2019s a lot of it that I don\u2019t remember.\u201d It turned out to be bipolar disorder, which had not yet been diagnosed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a grandiosity that you have,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cEverybody else around you notices it, but going through it, you don\u2019t notice your poor judgment. I didn\u2019t give a sh*t.\u201d Bizarre episodes followed, and his troubles made headlines for months.\nBy that July, he was fleeing the Los Angeles police, who eventually arrested Carroll and charged him with three felonies: carrying a loaded firearm in public; fleeing a police vehicle and driving against traffic; and a disregard for safety by eluding an officer.\nBut Carroll, now 46, said he is back on track. His candor in front of thousands was his way of normalizing mental health struggles, he said, making them okay to talk about. But he also wanted to underscore his newfound equanimity, to tell the audience that he was better and to position himself for a return to the industry when the non-compete expires. Carroll said that he still owns a stake in 20,000 apartment units.\nIn April, he\nentered\na prosecution diversion program by agreeing to undergo mental health counseling for two years.\nT\nhe rise of a\nm\nultifamily mogul\nCarroll grew up in Tampa, from \u201cnot a lot of money,\u201d he said. He started flipping homes in the Southeast U.S. when he moved to Atlanta after graduating from high school. He developed and sold a 150-unit apartment project in Atlanta when he was 27, using the profits to buy three property management companies that oversaw 22,000 apartment units.\nHe began a sharper ascent in 2010, when he started raising capital from such institutional investors as Carlyle Group. \u201cIt was a big deal for me to get joint venture capital\u201d back then, he said.\nCarroll Organization became a multifamily sponsor that partnered with institutional investors to buy properties in the Sun Belt. The company also managed the properties in-house. In 2022, the year before Carroll sold the company, Carroll Organization acquired 14 multifamily projects with 5,000 units for a total purchase price of $1.3 billion, and sold 23 properties with nearly 8,500 apartments for a total sale price of $2.2 billion, according to the firm\u2019s annual report.\nTRD\nfirst picked up on him\nin 2015\n, when he signed two mortgages totaling $84 million for a $112 million purchase of the 812-unit Resort at Laguna Lakes in West Palm Beach.\n\u201cThe Sun Belt market welcomes guys like me with open arms,\u201d he said at the Forum.\nAt the time, multifamily real estate was still dominated by mom-and-pop operators, and the institutionalization of the sector was just beginning.\n\u201cEverybody else around you notices it, but going through it, you don\u2019t notice your poor judgment. I didn\u2019t give a sh*t.\u201d\nPatrick Carroll\nCarroll saw the trend early and positioned himself at the forefront, building a platform that would eventually buy and sell more than 90,000 units across the region, generating average investment returns of 25 percent over a three-and-a-half-year hold period, he said.\u200b\n\u201cEverybody thought the Sun Belt was red neck,\u201d he said. Pre-Covid, when he\u2019d go up to New York, he remembered, \u201cI\u2019d be wearing a Kiton suit, and [because of the type of properties I was investing in] they thought I was a red neck in a pickup truck.\u201d\nBut when pandemic shifts sent people packing from New York and California to some of the locations where his portfolio was \u2014 Texas, Florida and the Carolinas \u2014 Carroll spied the deadline for the early-bird special.\n\u201cI was screaming at my investors, \u2018We have to sell!\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t because I thought things were going to fall off a cliff. I just said, things can\u2019t get much better, so why not take profits?\u201d\nThe ability to spot\nmarket inflection points\nearned him a reputation as a visionary, even as his brash style alienated some in the industry.\u200b\n\u201cWe would buy a billion a year,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cI\u2019d go do a victory lap in New York and tell potential new investors, \u2018I\u2019m making so much money with Carlyle, you really should partner with me.\u2019\u201d\nC\nrashing out\nLike the rest of the world, Carroll signed up for Instagram sometime in the late 2010s. Although the platform isn\u2019t to blame for his problems, it did allow others to see them.\nBeginning in 2023, shortly before selling his company, Carroll would occasionally go on rampages, sometimes documenting the incidents himself. Last spring, he filmed and posted videos of himself berating customer service employees at a Bentley car dealership and an Apple store. Carroll also posted inflammatory comments about other prominent Miamians on social media, threatened attorneys and engaged in public confrontations that contradicted his image of a disciplined dealmaker.\nIn the months around his arrest in Los Angeles, Carroll found himself in trouble with law enforcement in other jurisdictions.\nIn March of last year, Carroll posted a video on his account that showed him on his boat docked in his backyard. He clutched a shotgun, sported a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat and a white towel draped over his shoulders. From the boat\u2019s bow, Carroll fired off a couple of rounds that he later claimed were blanks when police officers showed up at his house after neighbors called the authorities.\nDays later,\nMiami Beach Police\nobtained a court order forcing Carroll to undergo a three-day involuntary psychiatric evaluation. Officers also confiscated his firearms during his hospital stay. Following his release, Carroll told\nTRD\nat the time that doctors gave him a clean bill of health.\nEight months later, cops arrested Carroll in\nWyoming\non an outstanding warrant for felony aggravated stalking because he had allegedly violated a 15-day temporary restraining order to stay away from his ex-wife, Lindsey Truex. In November, a Florida prosecutor dropped the charge after determining that Carroll had called\nTruex\nafter the restraining order had expired.\nCarroll also recently privately settled three civil lawsuits against him in Miami-Dade County Circuit Court and Los Angeles Superior Court. The two cases in Miami involved a restaurant manager,\nMiguelangel Weill\n, and a videographer, Roberto Gatica. Weill alleged that Carroll defamed him by falsely accusing him of extortion via a spokesperson. Carroll got into a confrontation with Weill at a Wynwood sushi spot in 2023. The incident allegedly ended with Carroll spitting at Weill.\nGatica sued Carroll for breach of contract and civil battery tied to a video assignment in March 2024 that turned ugly. Carroll allegedly contracted Gatica through an agency to shoot video content for the mogul\u2019s Instagram account. Gatica alleged that Carroll verbally insulted him, including calling him a \u201cfat motherf*cker,\u201d and pushed him when he decided to leave and quit the assignment.\nThe Los Angeles lawsuit was filed by two ex-body guards who accused Carroll of civil assault, battery, false imprisonment, wrongful termination and creating a hostile work environment.\n\u201cI wish I\u2019d never heard of Instagram and put all that out,\u201d Carroll admitted at the Forum. \u201cI look back on it and I see things that I posted, or I read articles, and I cringe.\u201d\u200b\nR\noad to redemption\nToday, Carroll uses his Instagram account, which has 1.1 million followers, to repair his image and be an outspoken advocate for mental health awareness. Flashy videos of him shopping for designer goods in Miami\u2019s Design District have been replaced with clips of Carroll sharing his knowledge on real estate and other investments. He still posts images and clips of him with his three sons and engaging in his favorite philanthropic endeavor, handing out free sneakers to children at the Boys and Girls Club.\n\u201cIf I just sat back, and the last thing you ever read about me was the stuff that was in Page Six and other stuff, nobody would know any different,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cSo I\u2019m on Instagram every day. I\u2019m showing people, you know, I\u2019m changed.\u201d\u200b\nCarroll\u2019s plan for 2027 is ambitious. He intends to build a new investment platform, hiring former Blackstone executives and other top talent to run the day-to-day operations while he focuses on strategy and capital raising. \u201cI want Carroll 2.0 to be the Navy Seals of what it was before,\u201d he said.\nCarroll remains confident that institutional investors will see past his controversies. \u201cSmart investors invest to make money, and I\u2019m a proven money maker,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been arrested or in trouble for anything based on integrity, never anything financially related and never anything that\u2019s affected my business. Mine were self-inflicted wounds. I think people are going to [say], \u201cHe went through a rough period of time, but he got the best help he could.\u2019\u201d\nAs Carroll prepares for his next chapter, he\u2019s determined to prove that redemption is possible. \u201cI\u2019m going to come out of the gate in 2027,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty positive I can do $500 million to $1 billion worth of acquisitions. This is the phase I call, \u2018waving my ass around.\u2019\u201d",

        "content": "Deep in Palm Beach County, out where the suburbs meet the swamp, dirt has turned to gold.\nThe miracle has unfolded behind the guarded gates of Stone Creek Ranch, a community in an unincorporated part of the county near Delray Beach, where just 37 homes occupy 187 acres. It is about as far inland as one can go before reaching the Everglades.\nIt is one of dozens of gated communities that have sprung from the earth where sugarcane and bell peppers once grew. With names like Seven Bridges, Stonebridge, and Boca Bridges, these are places where well-heeled buyers can pick up a house for $1 or $2 million.\nIt wasn\u2019t long ago that Stone Creek was much like its neighbors \u2014 nice, but hardly noteworthy.\nBut the gated community is now a magnet for record-breaking deals and billionaire buyers.\nThe once-anonymous development has recently had its name in headlines about its new high-profile owners. In October, the multi-hyphenate\nMark Wahlberg\ndropped $32.6 million on a gut-renovated 17,800-square-foot mansion on 2.7 acres. With seven bedrooms, a theater, wine room, gym, sauna, cigar lounge, guest house and pool, it\u2019s a boilerplate home by Stone Creek standards.\nHis purchase triggered a rush for homes in the neighborhood, according to Talbot Sutter, the broker and owner of Sutter &amp; Nugent.\n\u201cEverything in Stone Creek basically went under contract after Mark Wahlberg bought that house,\u201d he said \u2014 including one of his listings.\nThat it has been catapulted to the absolute upper echelons of South Florida\u2019s luxury real estate market puzzles Sutter\u2019s colleagues in more established markets. Palm Beach agents well acquainted with courting the same billionaire crowd wonder why in hell would luxury buyers spend this kind of money in what is, from their view, the boonies.\nYes, there are more centrally located neighborhoods with better access to prestigious clubs, hot restaurants and the ocean, but that is not what Stone Creek\u2019s buyers want. These buyers prioritize\nsafety\nand\nprivacy\nabove all else, which can deter them from Palm Beach, where anyone can come and go unsurveilled. Stone Creek residents are people who want (and have) high-tech safe rooms with reinforced steel.\nThe neighborhood\u2019s rise is also closely linked to the South Florida wealth migration catalyzed by the pandemic. Buyers suddenly flooded the market with a flipped set of values and needs: mainly, isolation and the livability of a full-time home rather than a warm weather pied-\u00e0-terre.\n\u201cStone Creek Ranch checked every box,\u201d Rockstar Energy founder Russell Weiner said: size, price, privacy and amenities.\n\u201cWhy in the hell that location, I have no clue.\u201d\nTalbot Sutter, Sutter &amp; Nugent on his first impression of the site\nBillionaire Weiner, who legally changed his last name to Savage, is a prolific luxury real estate investor. Shortly after Wahlberg\u2019s purchase, he went into contract on\ntwo\nStone Creek\nhomes\n, one at 16071 Quiet Vista Circle asking $20.9 million and another at 9303 Hawk Shadow Lane asking $22 million.\nThese are remarkable prices for non-waterfront homes, but still fall short of the neighborhood\u2019s price record.\nIn January, a member of the Cafaro family bought a 2.5-acre spec estate for $41.5 million. The Cafaros own their namesake development company, a Niles, Ohio-based firm best known for pioneering the American mall concept. They named their nearly 19,600-square-foot megamansion Casa Maranello for the Italian city where Ferraris are produced. It has a 12-car garage, 12-seat theater, salon facilities, a soccer field, sport court and putting green. Though the sale recorded with the county as $41.5 million, including furniture and other personal items, the total was $55 million, according to listing agent Senada Ad\u017eem of Douglas Elliman.\nThe new buyers are not the first to discover Stone Creek. The Weeknd shopped around the neighborhood, and billionaire Mets owner Steve Cohen bought a 31,000-square-foot mansion there in 2021. But as much as this inland compound of megamansions seemed to spring to prominence overnight, its ascendancy was 25 years in the making.\nAd\u017eem has been selling homes in Stone Creek since 2018. She remembers when the average sales price hovered in the $6 million range.\n\u201cIt was not known unless you were local,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of prestige now to be able to live in Stone Creek Ranch.\u201d\nC\nane fields and dirt roads\nSutter, a born-and-bred Palm Beach County local whose grandfather was one of the area\u2019s first real estate agents, got licensed straight after graduating from the Benjamin School in 2007. Not long after, he met Ken Endelson, the founder of homebuilder Kenco Communities. Endelson had created the Stone Creek subdivision in 2000, envisioning an exclusive enclave of massive estates. Unlike its neighbors, there would be no golf course, no clubhouse and no communal tennis courts. Just a small concentration of enormous, private homes.\nThe surrounding land was just \u201ccane fields and peppers. The 441 was still a dirt road,\u201d Sutter said. \u201cWhy in the hell that location, I have no clue.\u201d\nSutter was incredulous, but Endelson spoke of a grand future where Stone Creek would be a hub for the global elite. The hitch was that Kenco had hit a rough patch in the financial crisis, and Endelson needed buyers. Some of the planned homes were built and spoken for, but much of Stone Creek was still dirt. In 2009, he sold 19 remaining lots to an affiliate of Axiom Group for $10.1 million, according to property records. In the years that followed, Axiom sold off the lots and buyers filled in the blanks with custom-built megamansions inside the community.\nDespite the economic trouble and relative youth of Stone Creek, well-connected buyers emerged. Wayne Huizenga Jr. bought a 5-acre site for $1 million in 2009. He built the mansion and sold it to Office Depot CEO Gerry Smith for $6.7 million in 2017. Huizenga is the son of late billionaire H. Wayne Huizenga, who built Waste Management, Blockbuster Video, Extended Stay America and AutoNation.\nInsurance moguls Seth and Brad Cohen of Insurance Care Direct also built homes they eventually sold for $17 million and $19 million, respectively. They bought their sites for $800,000 and $900,000.\nMarket insiders said these buyers had a snowball effect \u2014 big names begot more big names.\nThe 2020 set found even more to like. They wanted space, security and all their creature comforts under one roof, as well as new construction. Buyers liked that there was no club component to the community, as it meant no club dues, no club politics and no club employees coming and going, agents said.\n\u201cTheir whole thing is their house is their club house,\u201d Sutter said, describing in-home spas in some houses that \u201cmake the Ritz-Carlton look like child\u2019s play.\u201d\n\u201cThese homes are so big and gnarly with every bell and whistle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201d\nT\nhe Starkification\no\nf Stone Creek\nThere is one man who is responsible for building Stone Creek\u2019s biggest, gnarliest, every-bell-and-whistle homes:\nAldo Stark\n. The founder of Prestige Design Homes, he flipped the mansion to Wahlberg, built the Cafaro family\u2019s Casa Maranello and erected a James Bond-inspired spec estate dubbed Villa Spectre, which he sold for $36.8 million to retired tech CEO Barry Smith last December.\nHe is known for building massive homes at breakneck speeds, often with a style best described as high drama. The press-shy builder is pictured bearded, in large, dark shades and a pinstriped suit on his website, lending itself to the flash and intrigue he cultivates.\n\u201cThey were very bold and daring,\u201d Ad\u017eem said of Casa Maranello and Villa Spectre. \u201cThat is a hallmark of Stark\u2019s vision.\u201d\nAd\u017eem is Stark\u2019s go-to agent for his spec homes in Stone Creek, and she helped sell him the lots for those homes. She sees Stark\u2019s arrival in the neighborhood as the moment it blew through its previous price ceiling.\n\u201cWe were able to offer a new level of product,\u201d she said.\nStark\u2019s homes are fueling the continued interest from Stone Creek\u2019s A-list buyers. Weiner equated the neighborhood to Beverly Park in Los Angeles, a gated community known for large estates, celebrity homes and guarded entrances. It has some peers in Palm Beach County as well. The Bears Club in Jupiter, home to Michael Jordan, is extremely private and secure. Similar to Stone Creek, it has fewer than 55 single-family homes across its 400 acres, although it does have a golf club and a few smaller villas for members. Edward Brown, the former CEO of Patr\u00f3n Spirits, sold his Bears Club mansion for a record $48 million this year.\nThe success of these gated enclaves is providing inspiration for a new crop of golf communities shooting up farther north in Hobe Sound, like the Discovery Land Company\u2019s Atlantic Fields. The planned community will have 317 homes on more than 1,500 acres, according to its website. And it will, of course, be gated.\nStill, the staying power of such projects has yet to be tested, and so much depends upon the buyers who ultimately commit to spend there. Part of the value of Stone Creek is in its owners, and their own devotion to maintaining property values, said Sutter.\n\u201cIt\u2019s mansion banking,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re always going to be protected. There is billionaire after billionaire in there who is not going to let their house go under $2,000 a foot.\u201d\nFor Weiner, it\u2019s a safe investment, but the estates in Stone Creek also provide what money can\u2019t buy in other parts of South Florida.\n\u201cCompared to Palm Beach island or Miami Beach, it\u2019s a steal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe teardowns in Palm Beach are $200 million and this has more land. It\u2019s gated and armed and no one can drive by; what is that worth?\u201d\n\u2014Katherine Kallergis contributed reporting",

        "content": "On the edge of Miami-Dade County\u2019s built world, where single-family home subdivisions plateau into open expanses, sits a 90-acre tract. The land in south Miami-Dade is neatly carved into distinct uses: one parcel planted with row crops such as soybeans, another devoted to a palm tree farm, a third to an avocado orchard and a fourth to a nursery for a variety of plants.\nHere, developers Salim and Kamil Chraibi plan roughly 500 townhomes and 76 large single-family homes lining the perimeter of the property. Every home will be capped at workforce prices and 20 percent of units will be reserved for households earning no more than 140 percent of Miami-Dade\u2019s $87,200 median income.\n\u201cWe are building townhomes that are barn style \u2026 that would match the agricultural style around,\u201d Salim said, showing a rendering of the barn-like fa\u00e7ades with steep pitched metal roofs.\nThe project embodies the Chraibis\u2019 niche: developing workforce housing in south Miami-Dade.\nBluenest Development, the Miami-based firm which Salim founded in 2018 and Kamil, the younger brother, joined about a year later, has seized on the rich supply of cheaper land in the south county area and on the high demand for housing priced below market rate.\nIt\u2019s hardly the only firm leaning into this play. During the recent years\u2019 boom in demand due to an influx of out-of-staters, developers rushed to south Dade, the county\u2019s last frontier for housing development, but Bluenest far outpaced many of its contemporaries.\nThey \u201care very aggressive and they do what they say they are going to do. \u2026 They built a very good reputation in a short amount of time,\u201d said Jason Bass, who last year was part of a partnership that sold a\n20-acre development site\nin Homestead to Bluenest. \u201cThe dealings I\u2019ve had with Bluenest \u2026 they never ask for any extensions [to land acquisition closing] or concessions that are much to speak of.\u201d\nThe numbers show the momentum. Bluenest\u2019s portfolio is heavily concentrated in the southern part of the county and includes 1,000 completed homes and a pipeline of about 3,000 homes in various stages of approval and development, according to the firm.\nAs South Florida quickly turned into a buyer\u2019s market over the past year, the Chraibis\u2019 target demographic of buyers\ninsulates them from the slowdown\n, largely because demand for below-market priced homes is\nperennial\n.\n\u201cIt seemed like everybody was willing to build high-end mansions; $10-, $15-, $20 million homes. But then when you looked at the median income, I was wondering where all of these people were living.\u201d\nSalim Chraibi, Bluenest Development\nStill, they aren\u2019t immune to the\neconomic headwinds\nthat developers are facing, including elevated materials and labor costs, and unfavorable interest rates. Not to mention lingering doubts about the long-term viability of south Miami-Dade \u2014 an area that offers farmland, strip malls and subdivisions pushing toward the Everglades but lacks the Miami allure of oceanfront views, glitzy architecture and 24/7 entertainment.\nBut Bluenest is accelerating. By the third quarter of next year, it expects to complete roughly 400 homes and start construction of nearly 600, Salim said. His ambitions are bigger.\n\u201cOur goal by 2028,\u201d he said, \u201cis to start delivering a thousand homes a year.\u201d\nIt\u2019s ambitious. In the cutthroat world of real estate, the developers who scale quickly tend to be deeply embedded in the industry. Many are born into families that already hammered out a reputation in South Florida and\ntake the reins\nfrom their\nparents\n. Others, who start out as unknowns, usually run in circles where they can tap into deep-pocketed investors.\nAs South Florida transplants, the Chraibis have none of that\u00a0 yet, scaled in less than a decade to become one of the top non-institutional workforce housing developers in south Miami-Dade.\nZ\nero to 4,000\nSalim, 36, and Kamil, 31, are newcomers to South Florida but not to real estate. Growing up in Casablanca, Morocco, the pair often joined their mother, architect and land broker Nadia Daoudi, on job sites. Their grandmother had developed homes and apartment buildings in the 1960s in the city.\n\u201cMy grandmother was always pushing everybody to be in real estate. \u2018Stick to the rock,\u2019\u201d Salim recalled her saying. \u201cWe were always attracted to real estate and it was natural in a way for us to transition because it was always something that really attracted us.\u201d\nAlthough they moved to South Florida to pursue other careers, Salim came to play golf for Johnson &amp; Wales University, intending to play the sport professionally, and Kamil went to Florida International University, planning on going into tech but real estate beckoned. The gap in housing supply hit them immediately.\n\u201cIt seemed like everybody was willing to build high-end mansions; $10-, $15-,\n$20 million homes. But then when you looked at the median income, I was wondering where all of these people were living,\u201d Salim said. \u201cQuickly, we found that there was a huge demand, that it [a home] would be on the market for a couple of days and then it would go under contract.\u201d\nFrom 2018 to 2020, they completed their first standalone homes and duplexes, including five in Miami-Dade\u2019s Brownsville and West LIttle River, and Miami\u2019s Liberty City on lots they purchased for a combined $183,100, records show.\nFinding construction loans was difficult, and Salim tried his luck with Key Biscayne-based family firm London Financial, which generally doesn\u2019t finance construction debt less than $1 million. Still, it provided Bluenest with a $650,000 construction loan in 2018 for its first few homes, records show.\nEd London, London Financial manager, just had a \u201cgut feeling\u201d about Salim after they met for lunch, he said.\n\u201cHe seemed to be a hustler and somebody with ambition,\u201d London said. \u201cYou know when someone knows what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d\nThe brothers credit their quick scaling to delivering on promises to their partners, and their perspective. Their immigrant background allows them to truly see the opportunities in the U.S., they said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to do what we have done in any other country in the world,\u201d Salim said. \u201cYou have a big market, you have people who are buying, you have access to capital.\u201d\nThose who\u2019ve had dealings with the Chraibis have described them as \u201cworkaholics\u201d and \u201cabove-board businessmen.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s just as much about work as it is about embedding themselves in the community. Many of the foreign developers who scale in South Florida usually have financial backing from investors in their countries of origin. The Chraibis, whose father, Khalid Chraibi, died when they were young, cited some \u201cfinancial hardship\u201d during their youth. Although they started with some backing from \u201cfriends and family,\u201d they forged the majority of their investor relationships with South Florida family offices and high net worth individuals.\nAs of late, Salim also has been making the rounds at local podcasts, describing his focus on workforce housing, a topic that\u2019s bound to garner him an audience given Miami-Dade\u2019s affordability crisis.\nIt\u2019s paid off. Although Lennar, a Miami-based homebuilding giant founded over 70 years ago, has a\nmonopoly\non south Miami-Dade residential development\u00a0 thanks to its financial wherewithal and backing from the likes of Warren Buffett and massive land banks \u2014 every land use attorney and developer The Real Deal contacted for this story knew the Chraibi brothers and cited them as a major force in the area.\nBluenest is phasing out from building individual homes and focusing on communities, with their portfolio consisting of 23 complexes in various stages, from planned to completed and under construction, primarily in south Dade.\nThe townhomes have commonalities: usually spanning about 1,900 square feet with at least three bedrooms and higher-end finishes that can be found in $2 million homes, including impact windows and doors; waterfall countertops; higher ceilings; some with foyers and powder rooms, or half-baths in the foyers; and pajama rooms upstairs with couches where families can hang out.\nPrices are capped at $451,000, squarely targeting the workforce that wants to own a home in the county, where the median home price hovers at about $500,000, without sacrificing on size, yard space and finishes.\nMany of the projects are much smaller than their Krome one. Its pipeline includes: K Legacy with 57 townhomes on a 4-acre lot in Princeton, Palm Villas with 33 duplexes on another 4 acres in Naranja, Park Villas with 76 homes on 9.5 acres near Homestead and Limonar Estates with 34 duplexes on a 4.2-acre site in Naranja.\nThey are \u201cbeing very entrepreneurial because not every project can be a 300-unit project [because] there\u2019s less of that land. There\u2019s more of these smaller pieces,\u201d said land use attorney Anthony De Yurre. \u201cThe question is how do you \u2026 build out the business model. Obviously they have figured it out.\u201d\nT\nhe Chraibi code\nThe math has to math and that starts with the price of land, Kamil said.\n\u201cBecause if you buy it too expensive, it becomes impossible to create all of that unless you want to lose money in the process,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been very careful in how we would buy.\u201d\nThey then take on the financial risk of upzoning the sites, including paying attorneys, architects and deposits for the properties, because more density allows for lower home prices.\n\u201cInstead of building K Legacy with 30 or 40 homes, we are building 57. That extra 27 is allowing us to bring workforce [prices],\u201d Salim said. \u201cVersus if we were just doing 40 single-family homes, we would sell them in the $700,000s. It\u2019s still a viable plan. But that\u2019s not really what we would like to create.\u201d\nSometimes, deals just work out. When Bluenest approached Sam Accursio, whose family has been farming in south Dade since the 1960s, seeking to purchase the Park Villas site, they didn\u2019t set a price contingent on project approval or based on appraisals. Instead, Accursio asked for $4 million, and Bluenest agreed.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of money for 10 acres,\u201d Accursio said. \u201cI think that [$4 million] would have been the top of the market in that area at the time.\u201d\nWhile construction costs have stabilized in the last two years, though labor costs remain more of an issue, Salim said Bluenest is protecting itself as much as possible by having in-house general contractors and a proprietary tech tool to identify and evaluate prospective sites for purchase. Elevated interest rates are more of an issue, as their target buyers are concerned about their monthly payments.\nBluenest\u2019s hedge against buyers cooling to closing on homes? It works with Miami-Dade\u2019s down payment assistance programs, which provide low-interest and forgivable loans to help buyers front the money for a home. Bluenest also offers rate buydowns, and accepts FHA and VA loans.\nThe brothers don\u2019t doubt south Miami-Dade\u2019s potential, though the issue of a lack of commercial space and amenities isn\u2019t lost on them. Their Krome project will include about 10 acres of commercial space, including a grocery store, a linear park and could also have a school and padel courts, they said.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to sit in traffic for a long time,\u201d Kamil added. \u201cSo if you can have a grocery store next to your house, if you can have green space near your house, where you can go to the gym and walk with your kids, and maybe potentially school, it saves you a lot of time.\u201d\nThe bigger obstacles, the Chraibis said, are building workforce homes quickly enough and NIMBYism.\nThe county is short nearly\n90,200 affordable units\n, Salim said, citing a report by nonprofit Miami Homes for All. Many of those who can no longer afford Miami-Dade are moving elsewhere in the state, prompting fears that South Florida is losing its workforce, the backbone that supports the tri-county region.\n\u201cYou have a lot of people who bought homes in the \u201870s and \u201880s. \u2026 You build townhomes [nearby and] they are mad,\u201d Salim said. \u201cPeople think of workforce housing as \u2018Oh, these people are going to come and they are going to destroy my neighborhood.\u2019 No, these are teachers, teaching your kids at school, these are people who show up at your door when you call 911. \u2026 [The] workforce is what makes a city.\u201d",

        "content": "Last December, a cameraman shadowed Josh Flagg as he wandered about his most recent purchase, a Mid-Century Modern home.\nIt was the early afternoon and the\nCompass\nagent had been up since about 7:30 a.m. He\u2019d had social calls with a few famous friends, plus a steady stream of Zooms about: the latest real estate acquisition by his family\u2019s business, an event he was hosting, his two-year-old real estate media firm and a bagel venture he\u2019d helped finance. Then, Flagg drove himself (he typically has a driver) to Beverly Hills to meet with the jeweler designing a pin for his tuxedo. Capping a day with no real downtime, he was off to look at plans for another house he owns on Bedford Drive.\n\u201cI love it that way,\u201d Flagg said. \u201cI can sleep when I\u2019m dead.\u201d\nThat he shared the busy day with a reporter and a tour of his home with the 3 million followers across his Estate Media\u2019s social channels can help explain what propelled Flagg onto a stage well beyond real estate.\nHe spent 15 seasons on \u201cMillion Dollar Listing Los Angeles,\u201d where fans liked him as the Beverly Hills agent with a quick wit, exacting taste and encyclopedic knowledge of Los Angeles\u2019 most historically significant homes. The renown yielded opportunities beyond real estate \u2014 the events, the media company, the friendships with locals like Candy Spelling and Melissa Rivers.\nBut with the show now on pause, Flagg is ramping up his run at the helm of his family\u2019s business, Flagg Family Capital, a commercial real estate portfolio built by his parents and grandparents. His next act is upon him: proving he can carry on the legacy and expand into luxury markets.\nYet he comes to the job with baggage. Within the industry, he is a polarizing figure. Some scoff he\u2019s just another reality TV celebrity who can hardly be considered a market leader when it comes to selling high-end real estate. There\u2019s also the matter of the made-for-TV drama that\u2019s followed Flagg over the years: arrested for allegedly stealing art from clients (the issue was reportedly dropped due to lack of evidence),\nleaving Douglas Elliman\non contentious grounds and accusing his former boss in a\nlawsuit\nof hacking his computer (the suit later\ndropped\nthe executive as a defendant in July).\nThe spotlight has also captured moments such as Flagg\u2019s marriage to Bobby Boyd and their divorce in 2023.\nThough he has lived so much in the public eye, Flagg still seeks to guard his image. The slightest whiff of controversy can spark a swift demand letter, such as the one threatening a defamation suit sent to The Real Deal by Flagg\u2019s attorney in relation to a mention of the alleged 2008 art theft.\n\u201cWithin days of the allegations being made against my client in 2008, the Los Angeles District Attorney determined that it would not pursue any charges against my client,\u201d the letter said.\nStill, it\u2019s hard to deny that Flagg, already a well-connected Angeleno, saw an early opportunity in reality TV, and leveraged it into a career that\u2019s made him a household name with a long business runway.\n\u201cOne could look down on reality television but at the end of the day, my highest-net-worth clients watch [\u201cMillion Dollar Listing\u201d],\u201d he said. \u201cYou go on American Airlines or Delta, it\u2019s on the plane. It\u2019s not a reality show that\u2019s drama-based with housewives throwing wineglasses in people\u2019s faces. Everyone loves high-end houses, and everyone likes real estate porn and Los Angeles properties.\u201d\nWhile Flagg is not at the top of the heap in sales volume-based rankings, such as TRD\u2019s annual list, his name is often heard in connection with local trophy properties.\nHe was one of the listing agents on Casa Encantada at 10644 Bellagio Road, which was at one time asking $250 million before going off and on the market at reduced pricing. Earlier this year, he sold the Gloria Vanderbilt Estate in the Beverly Hills Flats for $16.1 million. He co-listed with Douglas Elliman\u2019s Matt Altman, his former \u201cMillion Dollar Listing Los Angeles\u201d co-star, the Beverly Hills home of \u201cReal Housewives of Orange County\u201d cast members Heather and Terry Dubrow. The property, at 1501 Tower Grove, sold for $16.5 million. Last month he nabbed the listing for 1436 Bella Drive, known as Falcon Lair which was originally built and owned by silent film actor Rudolph Valentino and later home to tobacco heiress Doris Duke.\nF\namily business\nFor all the high-profile estates attached to his name, residential real estate is not the family business; that\u2019s Flagg Family Capital, where he has big shoes to fill.\nFlagg\u2019s paternal grandmother was Edith Flagg, who started the ready-to-wear label Edith Flagg Inc., which is credited with being the first to import polyester to the U.S. in 1967.\nAfter apparel, Edith and Josh\u2019s father, Michael Flagg, turned their focus to real estate, purchasing a 46,000-square-foot office at 400 South Beverly Drive in Beverly Hills. On the roof was a neon \u201cFlagg\u201d sign, \u201cso large, you could see it from the moon,\u201d Michael remembered. It became known as the Flagg Building and embarrassed everyone except Michael\u2019s father, who liked the attention grabber.\nJosh\u2019s mother, Cindy Flagg, is from the Platt family, one of Los Angeles\u2019 oldest Jewish families, and is also involved in real estate. Within the family\u2019s real estate portfolio were multiple properties on Broadway in Downtown Los Angeles, including the Platt Fine Arts Building. Josh\u2019s great-grandfather, Benjamin Platt, was also one of the founding board members of City of Hope.\n\u201cWe talk about things no one bothers with anymore \u2014 China patterns, menu sequences, whether French service is more elegant than English service.\u201d\nCandy Spelling on her friendship with Josh Flagg\nIn 2023, Michael shifted business responsibilities to Josh, who is now looking to move the focus from shopping centers and offices into the high-end spaces of New York, Miami and Palm Beach real estate.\nFor many scions, the heat would be on to make a mark on the family business, become a part of the history. Despite this switch in the business model, Josh doesn\u2019t feel it.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any pressure because I don\u2019t have any kids yet and, you know, I\u2019m the only son,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I\u2019m doing what I think is best and what I know how to do.\u201d\nIn doing things his way, he is reshaping the family firm\u2019s strategy.\n\u201cThere are two schools of thought: long-term appreciation versus cash flow. I have always believed in cash flow, and it took a long time for me to understand [Josh\u2019s] mentality,\u201d Michael, who declined a phone interview with TRD, wrote in an email. \u201cBut when I saw him purchase for us a few things that were worth two times or even three times what we paid within a short time, I effectively changed my mind.\u201d\nWhat Michael saw flipped the script on what he viewed as Josh\u2019s core trade competency as a \u201cresidential guy\u201d and instead showed that he had the \u201cMidas touch\u201d on real estate, period. With Michael, at over 80 years old, no longer interested in expanding the portfolio, Josh\u2019s increased responsibility was a natural transition.\n\u201cJosh is more than half my age; I had him when I was 42,\u201d Michael said. \u201cThis is where Josh comes in. It\u2019s Josh\u2019s future and he has clearly proven himself to be very smart when it comes to real estate. When I turned 80, I am not sure if it was a conscious decision or whether I was just ready to turn things over unconsciously, but now Josh is in charge of everything.\u201d\nMichael still has the final yay or nay, but Josh finds the deals, runs the numbers and presents opportunities to his father. Among the family\u2019s newer real estate investments was in New York, 5,500 square feet of\nSoho retail space\nat 170 Mercer Street, which they picked up for an undisclosed amount. He\u2019s now in the process of opening a family office in which Michael also appears to be putting his full trust in his son.\n\u201cI leave it to him,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, he gets it from my mother.\u201d\nO\nnly child\nFor Flagg, the work comes across almost as if it\u2019s rote, nothing to get overly excited about nor to brag about, whether looking backward or forward.\n\u201cWhat motivates me?\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve just always been driven by work. I love working. I don\u2019t know what I would do if I didn\u2019t work. I\u2019d be bored out of my mind.\u201d\nAt the dining room table of his Trousdale Estates home last year, he fielded questions about his plans. He doesn\u2019t see any one of his businesses eclipsing the others, he said. Being all over the place is just how it goes for him.\nWork colleagues and close friends seem to have a better handle on him. They describe Flagg as an old soul who\u2019s different from his TV persona, which, as he described on episode 1 of season 15, is \u201cegotistical, condescending, somewhat rude and abrasive.\u201d\n\u201cJosh is hilarious and I don\u2019t think on TV \u2014 he does come off as Josh \u2014 but I\u2019m not sure that people get truly how funny he is and how smart he is,\u201d Rivers, who considers Flagg a loyal friend, said. He was one of the first to invite her to stay after she lost her home to the Palisades Fire.\nSpelling, the wife of the late TV and film producer Aaron Spelling, chats constantly with Flagg; the two travel together often.\n\u201cPeople love to analyze it,\u201d she said of their friendship. \u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018Why are Candy and Josh so close? You\u2019re from different generations.\u2019 And I tell them, \u2018Because we\u2019re the same species: collectors.\u2019\u201d\nThat\u2019s how the two met: competing against one another at a Christie\u2019s auction in New York.\n\u201cWe talk about things no one bothers with anymore \u2014 China patterns, menu sequences, whether French service is more elegant than English service,\u201d said Spelling, who describes herself as shy and responded to questions via email rather than by phone.\nFlagg was precocious as a child and always friends with adults. His favorite pastime was chatting with grown-ups at the Polo Lounge in Beverly Hills or at the Brentwood or Hillcrest country clubs \u2014 his parents or grandparents and their acquaintances. He\u2019d play with the art or furniture in his grandmother\u2019s penthouse, or visit with her next-door neighbors, Mattel founders Ruth and Elliot Handler.\nThe obsession with real estate also began when he was young.\n\u201cIf I was six years old and I had a temper tantrum, the only way to calm me down, my mom would put me in her Mercedes convertible and we\u2019d drive around the neighborhood and look at houses and gates,\u201d he said.\nMichael recalled cities built of Legos strewn about Josh\u2019s childhood bedroom floor with model Rolls Royces parked outside buildings. Mischievous, Josh would take the house keys out of guests\u2019 pockets at dinner parties or family gatherings, Michael remembered.\n\u201cAt five years old, he had an affinity for anything that had to do with real estate,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess a key to him meant something even back then.\u201d\nM\naster of all trades?\nSome say the Cheshire Cat from \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d is symbolic of the power that comes from detachment. When one cares nothing about proving oneself with industry awards or rankings, constraints no longer exist in one\u2019s sense of self.\n\u201cThere\u2019s certain guys that are very specific \u2014 they just want to golf all day and build stuff, or you\u2019ve got guys that stay in their own lane, whether it\u2019s retail or multifamily or whatever. And Josh is really more opportunistic,\u201d Richard Weintraub, president and CEO of Weintraub Real Estate Group, said. Flagg is harder to pin down, he added.\nWeintraub, a fourth-generation Angeleno like Flagg, is behind some of the region\u2019s most significant retail projects, including the Malibu Lumber Yard and Shops at Sportsmen\u2019s Lodge in Studio City, and the two are eyeing a couple retail development possibilities in Southern California by the beach, according to the developer.\nWeintraub offered his take on the duality of Flagg: \u201cHe can go from having one too many to really locking down the numbers on a deal very easily.\u201d\nAnd Flagg\u2019s Estate Media, the real estate platform with original shows and podcasts, is scaling. It has\n$1 million in seed money\nraised last month from investors such as Compass\u2019 Tracy Tutor and the Hudson Advisory team in New York, in addition to TikTok co-founder Justin Mateen and his brother Tyler Mateen.\nGriff O\u2019Brien, Estate Media co-founder and CEO, said he\u2019s noticed that Flagg flips a switch from funny to serious when it comes to business.\n\u201cHe\u2019s much different than what the camera puts on,\u201d he said.\nStill, with all the talk about Flagg\u2019s serious approach to business, long-term planning (much like emphasizing cash flow) is not his style. Asked where he hopes each of the businesses he\u2019s involved with might be in, say, a decade, he declines to make projections.\nSome might view that as the privilege not to have to worry about success. Others figure it\u2019s part of the secret.\nHe minimizes the contrast.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not really how I think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t really think about the future. I just think about the present.\u201d",

        "content": "In a housing market defined by what wasn\u2019t available, Chicago\u2019s top real estate agent this year had to chase down business.\n\u201cI\u2019m talking to everyone all the time,\u201d said\nEmily Sachs Wong\n, the @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate broker who was the top-producing agent in Cook County in the 12 months ending in October, based on data compiled by The Real Deal. \u201cWhen people tell me they\u2019re thinking of selling, in my mind I\u2019m like, \u2018Who do I have for this?\u2019\u201d\nSachs Wong played the role of matchmaker more than ever this year. She leveraged her connections to seek out properties for her buyers before they hit the market and find buyers for her clients\u2019 listings, she said, navigating low supply in Lincoln Park to close deals.\nChicago\u2019s tight inventory was a consistent challenge for the top performing brokers this year. Homeowners with mortgages below 3 percent aren\u2019t selling, especially in the desirable neighborhoods like Lincoln Park, Bucktown and Lakeview, where many top agents make most of their deals.\nStill, Chicago\u2019s top 20 agents managed to increase their collective sales volume this year compared to last, thanks in part to rising home prices. The top 20 made a combined $3.2 billion in deals this year, which is up more than 14 percent from the $2.8 billion in volume by last year\u2019s top\u00a0 20. That total was spread over 3,338 deals, about 100 fewer than the top 20 brokers made last year.\nThe list counts both buy- and sell-side deals recorded in the Chicago-area multiple listing service from October 2024 to October 2025, excluding any off-market transactions. The ranking includes only Cook County sales and only residential properties over $100,000.\nSachs Wong\u2019s specialty in Lincoln Park \u2014 one of the nation\u2019s most sought-after neighborhoods \u2014 provides a window into dealmaking in the highest level of Chicago\u2019s real estate market, where connections are everything and exclusivity is prized. As listing authorities like the National Association of Realtors and Zillow push for more publicity in listings and transactions, much of the work of Chicago\u2019s top real estate agents is done by word of mouth.\n\u201cI have probably $50 million in sales that I\u2019ve offered that they just couldn\u2019t get so they re-signed their lease.\u201d\nMatt Laricy of Americorp, on deals that didn\u2019t happen\n\u201cKnowing that I have specific requirements for certain clients and trying to find them before they hit the market because when they hit the market, it\u2019s just so much more competitive,\u201d said Sachs Wong.\nSachs Wong and her team at @properties completed $338.3 million in sales in the last year across 174 transactions \u2014 a 72 percent increase from\n$196.6 million in 2024\n, vaulting her from third place to first in this year\u2019s rankings. As one half of what\u2019s likely Chicago\u2019s most powerful couple in residential real estate \u2014 Sachs Wong is married to @properties co-founder and co-CEO Thad Wong \u2014 she tapped into relationships within an influential social network to aid in dealmaking.\nBuyer, meet seller\nThe one-to-one matching Sachs Wong described is allowed under both NAR\u2019s Clear Cooperation Policy and Zillow\u2019s Listing Access Standards. But MRED\u2019s Private Listing Network, a tool used by some luxury sellers to keep their offerings off of public platforms like Zillow, has come under scrutiny, though Zillow hasn\u2019t yet begun to enforce its standards to exclude such listings once they do hit Chicago\u2019s standard MLS.\nNancy Tassone, a luxury broker with Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty who made her debut on\nTRD\n\u2019s 2025 rankings at No. 9, said she uses the Private Listing Network often for sellers who want privacy. If Zillow tightens restrictions on how private listings can be marketed, Tassone said luxury brokers would need to adapt.\n\u201cIt is definitely a tool that I use and that a lot of my colleagues who operate in the same price points do for a variety of reasons,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting how all of that plays out and how we have to pivot our strategies to conform, and also decide how important it is being on Zillow.\u201d\nCarrie McCormick\n, the @properties agent who jumped from No. 6 in 2024 to take the second spot this year, said she rarely employs private listings, preferring instead to give sellers full exposure. She sometimes uses the private network when a client wants to \u201cdip their toe\u201d in the market without full publicity.\n\u201cIf they took away the private [network] it wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world, but it\u2019s nice to have now because it\u2019s a nice option for sellers to have if they are not fully ready yet,\u201d she said.\nMaking multimillion-dollar deals was tough this year, especially in Sachs Wong\u2019s primary neighborhood of Lincoln Park, where available houses are rare and buyers with deep pockets line up to make offers.\n\u201cThere are so few people leaving their homes,\u201d Sachs Wong said. \u201cLincoln Park has become more popular than ever.\u201d\nSome of Sachs Wong\u2019s biggest sales this year were f\nour penthouse condos\nin the Gold Coast that were owned by billionaire Citadel founder Ken Griffin \u2014 two of which sold to\nGov. J.B. Pritzker\n. The condos, which she listed alongside Tassone, sold for a combined $34.9 million between November 2024 and April, a steep cut from the $58.75 million Griffin paid for them in 2017.\nLuxury swell\nComing in second behind Sachs Wong, McCormick made $310.9 million in sales on 162 transactions this year, a sharp rise from her $193.7 million in volume in 2024.\nThis year\u2019s top sellers were helped by the strength of\nthe luxury market\n, which blew past previous sales records this year. There were 105 sales of properties worth more than $4 million during the covered time period.\n\u201cThe luxury market has definitely gone up this year. The stock market\u2019s been doing well, a lot of people deployed some of their assets into real estate,\u201d McCormick said. \u201cAnd people are flocking to quality construction, quality properties.\u201d\nThe priciest sale in the rankings was a\n$31.5 million deal\nfor a lakefront estate in Winnetka, which was the most expensive single home resale in Chicagoland history until late November, when the record broke again. @properties agent Jena Radnay represented both the buyer and the seller on the deal. She also represented both sides in the\nnew record\ndeal, an off-market sale also in Winnetka, for $32.5 million. Radnay landed in sixth place in the rankings, with $213 million in sales across 41 transactions.\n\u201cIt was obviously a career high moment,\u201d Radnay said of the sale. \u201cThis property is an iconic lakefront property that can never be duplicated.\u201d\nInventory shortage\u00a0takes toll\nMatt Laricy of Americorp came in third, sliding from first place in\nTRD\n\u2019s 2024 rankings. The Laricy Team had a transaction volume of $273.1 million, a slight bump from the $269.5 million in volume the team did in 2024. Laricy\u2019s team was hit with tragedy early this year when his founding partner, Catherine Holbrook,\ndied at 40 shortly after giving birth\n.\nIn fourth place was Grigory Pekarsky, managing broker at Vesta Preferred Realty, followed by Jeff Lowe of the Lowe Group at Compass.\nAll of them said the inventory shortage was a challenge this year. Lowe, who dropped from second place in 2024 to fifth place this year, said his sales were hurt by low inventory and a drop in new condo buildings coming online. Lowe tallied $240.9 million in volume, compared to $247.6 million in the 2024 ranking.\n\u201cThere just aren\u2019t that many homes,\u201d Lowe said of Northwest Side neighborhoods. \u201cAnd when people don\u2019t sell, you get bidding wars left and right. So there\u2019s four to six buyers for every property you put on the market right now.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a plus for the broker who has the listing, but it means buyers have a harder time making a deal, and it pushes costs up, pricing out some buyers. Laricy said he had dozens of buyers this year who couldn\u2019t land a deal on the right house and decided to re-up their rental leases, dropping out of the market for another year.\n\u201cI have probably $50 million in sales that I\u2019ve offered that they just couldn\u2019t get so they re-signed their lease,\u201d Laricy said. \u201cThe biggest thing that hurt me is just, there wasn\u2019t enough inventory to meet the client demand.\u201d\nPekarsky\u2019s team at Vesta Preferred Realty increased its sales from $193.7 million in 2024 to $260.1 million this year. Pekarsky said his growth was helped by pushing his agents on outreach and contacting clients, and more carefully tracking their interactions.\n\u201cIf you contact 10 people the right way, one of them will eventually fall into your lap,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just been doing that on a much grander scale and learning how to do a bigger and bigger flow of communication.\u201d\nAccess data and contact information from this ranking\nhere\n.\nTRD Data\np\nuts the power of real data in your hands.",

        "content": "They say if you can\u2019t beat them, join them. For Compass, the adage could be, if you can\u2019t beat them, buy them.\nThe New York-based national brokerage came in second place in The Real Deal\u2019s 2025 rankings of top Chicago brokerages with $5.47 billion in sales in Cook County. But it still got to enjoy the fruits of the $7.85 billion in sales made by the top-ranked brokerage, Chicago\u2019s\n@properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate\n, which Compass acquired at the beginning of this year.\nAnd if Compass\u2019 bid to buy its\nnext biggest national competito\nr, Anywhere Real Estate, is approved by regulators, it would have ties to four of the top five performing brokerage firms in Cook County this year, either through direct ownership or through a franchise. Those four firms \u2014 @properties, Compass, Coldwell Banker Realty and Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty \u2014 made about $18 billion in sales volume over the last year, 63 percent of the total volume traded by the top 20 brokerages.\nCompass Regional Vice President Fran Broude said industry-wide consolidation was accelerated by last year\u2019s National Association of Realtors settlement that changed how brokers charge commissions.\n\u201cConsolidation is not a new thing here. I\u2019ve been around a long time, and I\u2019ve been through consolidation and disruption before,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of normal for the business.\u201d\nEven so, the phenomenon in Chicago\u2019s market this year was on a new scale. Compass\u2019 acquisition of @properties was finalized in January, while Baird &amp; Warner\nannounced its merger\nwith tech-focused Dream Town in June. And in September, Compass\nannounced its plans to acquire Anywhere\n, the national firm that owns big brands like Coldwell Banker, Sotheby\u2019s International Realty and Century 21.\n\u201cIf you think you\u2019re competitive as an only child, you\u2019re wildly more competitive when you have a sibling.\u201d\nThad Wong, co-founder and co-CEO of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate\nThe moves made for a seismic shift in the real estate fabric in Chicago, one that the industry rarely sees all at once, said Jim Miller, the president and managing broker at Jameson Sotheby\u2019s.\n\u201cAll of those would have been monster stories that would have been spread out over a decade and we got them in a matter of 12 months,\u201d he said. \u201cWe as an industry are having to learn to pivot, not overreact when changes happen.\u201d\nThe top 20 brokerages in 2025 tallied a combined $28.6 billion in sales volume this year across 49,947 transactions. That is down from the $29.3 billion in volume and 57,137 transactions traded by the top 20 brokerages in\nTRD\u2019s 2024 rankings\n. The list counts both buy- and sell-side deals recorded in the Chicago-area multiple listing service from October 2024 to October 2025, excluding any off-market transactions. The ranking includes only Cook County sales and only residential properties over $100,000.\nFinding an identity\nIn the increasingly amalgamated landscape of Chicago real estate, each brokerage is facing pressure to better define its brand and prove its value to consumers and agents.\nFor Thad Wong, co-founder and co-CEO of @properties, the merger with Compass has driven him to be more competitive with the parent company. He said the merger is forcing his firm to hone its value proposition and justify itself as a separate brand from Compass. It increased its volume by about $450 million this year, while Compass lost about $117 million in sales compared to last year.\n\u201cIf you think you\u2019re competitive as an only child, you\u2019re wildly more competitive when you have a sibling,\u201d Wong said. \u201cSo I think the cool part about it locally is that (@properties) being No. 1 and Compass being No. 2, we can compete very heavily with one another, and each side is going to get better.\u201d\nBroude said the acquisition went smoothly and Compass was intentional about allowing @properties to keep its brand and leadership.\n\u201cEvery intention is to keep two separate brands. There are different things about the companies,\u201d Broude said. \u201cThey both have very rich cultures, different but very rich cultures.\u201d\nBoth Wong and Broude said\n@properties is likely to adopt Compass\u2019 technology suite at some point in the future, but their platforms are currently still separate.\nAyoub Rabah, regional president of the corporate-owned Coldwell Banker Realty, said in the short term, its potential merger wasn\u2019t changing much for the brokerage. Coldwell kept its third place spot in this year\u2019s rankings, making $2.76 billion in sales over 6,257 transactions.\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely excited about the announcement and the merger, but what I\u2019m really focused on is serving the end consumer who\u2019s just trying to get into a home today,\u201d he said. He especially tries to find homeownership opportunities and address affordability for the lower end of the market, where many feel priced out of homes.\nSome executives at brokerages that are franchised under Anywhere\u2019s brands but owned independently said the merger could bring them the best of both worlds \u2014 the tech and network that Compass offers and their independent, local feel.\nColdwell Banker Real Estate Group, a family-owned brokerage that\u2019s one of the Midwest\u2019s largest, made TRD\u2019s rankings at No. 20 this year based on Cook County sales, completing $249.8 million in transaction volume across 517 sales. Should Coldwell Banker come under Compass\u2019 ownership, it could bring capital and better technology to the franchise, president and CEO Mike Prodehl said.\n\u201cWe have a tech stack now, it\u2019s just fairly antiquated,\u201d he said.\nIndependents\u00a0carve out lane\nAs national brokerage companies pursue consolidation, Chicago\u2019s independent firms view an opportunity to differentiate themselves and promise a local touch for agents and clients.\nBaird &amp; Warner, which ranked fourth in this year\u2019s list with $2.43 billion in sales across 4,702 transactions, has gone all in on its homegrown roots, at times jabbing Compass in public communications.\nLaura Ellis, chief strategy officer, executive vice president of residential sales at Baird &amp; Warner, said consumers will want to \u201cshop local\u201d with Baird &amp; Warner rather than the \u201cbig box stores\u201d of Compass and its affiliates.\n\u201cThe real estate industry for a long time was sort of looked at as a sea of sameness by agents and consumers,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening recently is illustrating that that\u2019s not the case. That the cultures are very different.\u201d\nTo further stake its claim as Chicago\u2019s local powerhouse, the Dream Town merger nearly doubled Baird &amp; Warner\u2019s presence in the city of Chicago.\nDream Town, which is ranked separately from Baird &amp; Warner in TRD\u2019s rankings, came in at No. 8 with $907 million in volume across 1,644 transactions. Combined, the two brokerages tallied $3.34 billion in volume over the last year.\nAnother local firm adapting to the shifting market is Fulton Grace Realty. The independent brokerage was ranked 11th in TRD\u2019s list, keeping the same rank as in 2024 and completing $512.8 million in transaction volume.\nFulton Grace acquired Main Street Real Estate Group, which had about 50 agents, in August. TJ Rubin, Fulton Grace\u2019s president and founder, said he expects smaller independent brokerages to continue to join forces to compete with the bigger companies.\n\u201cThere is a strong value proposition in independent brokerages,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can offer big firm resources, with still the family feel.\u201d\nAccess data and contact information from this ranking\nhere\n.\nTRD Data\np\nuts the power of real data in your hands.",

It will have a rooftop pool, a golf simulator and a 24-hour doorman, among other luxury amenities.\nThe $790,000-per-unit building is an affordable housing development in progress on the Far North Side of the city where tenants can expect to spend up to an hour on public transit getting to and from the Loop and return home to amenities that aren\u2019t luxurious.\nHuge gaps between affordable and market-rate development costs aren\u2019t exclusive to Chicago. A slate of recent studies and news reports indicate that in many U.S. cities, building affordable has become pricey, with some developments in Washington, D.C. and San Francisco passing the $1 million-per-unit threshold.\nThis is a conundrum in a country purportedly dedicated to solving a housing crisis for residents whose incomes aren\u2019t keeping up with living costs.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re spending $800,000 or $900,000 on one unit, that\u2019s a unit that doesn\u2019t get built,\u201d Chicago-based developer David Doig said.\nWant to build more housing, particularly affordable? Then, \u201cwe should be laser focused on how we can get the most amount of units with the least amount of cost,\u201d he said.\nThe hefty price tags aren\u2019t a revelation for those in the know. But as Americans increasingly push for more housing options, the contradiction \u2014 that affordable development is expensive to create \u2014 has trickled out to the mainstream. Debates over how we got here and what to do about it have been gaining traction on social media and making headlines in the\nWashington Post\n, the Wall Street Journal and regional publications.\nWhat drives up spending? Affordable housing developers have to pay for the usual line items: debt, materials and labor, all of which have been going up across the country.\nBut they also spend to comply with extra layers of bureaucratic red tape from whichever government agencies are subsidizing their project. And, they may shell out for amenities that the private market might not support, like four-bedroom units for families or on-site daycare facilities, meaning that price-per-square foot comparisons may not be apt.\n\u201cA lot of times, the news headline is just the per-unit cost without taking into account any apples-to-apples comparison about the deals \u2026 It can drive me crazy,\u201d San Diego-based affordable housing developer Jimmy Silverwood said.\nStill, there may be hope for making the development of affordable units more affordable. A slew of public policy changes and solutions from the private market are showing that housing can be built for less, even while making deals more appealing to investors.\nT\nhe blame game\nThe costs of debt, construction materials and labor are putting a strain on developers of all kinds. But when it comes to determining what factors drive up the costs of affordable housing specifically, there\u2019s plenty of blame to go around, developers say.\nA majority of affordable housing developments in the U.S. are funded by the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit, or LIHTC, system, which awards either 4 or 9 percent tax credits to affordable housing developers. Those developers then sell the credits to institutional investors or banks in exchange for the capital needed to get their project going.\nWhile the system helps developers secure funding to complete a project and offer discounted rent, it also means developers have to wind through a labyrinth of regulations to win the tax credit allocation in the first place.\nDevelopers also typically apply for additional funding from city or county housing agencies that may attach their own set of requirements \u2014 and expenses.\n\u201cThe only restrictions should be that they pass inspections and that everything is done according to code. But they create this race where it\u2019s impossible to get to the finish line.\u201d\nAndy Schcolnik, president of Chicago\u2019s South Side Builders Association\nTake a recent $66 million project proposed by affordable housing developer National CORE.\nThe projected cost to build the 81-unit apartment complex in the Los Angeles suburb of Agoura Hills comes out to about $800,000 per unit. A typical market-rate building in L. A. County costs about half as much to build, a recent study from the Rand Institute found.\nIn its LIHTC application, CORE noted that it set aside $2.1 million for local impact fees (which apply to projects of all types), $1.8 million for architectural and engineering costs, $777,000 for permit processing, $285,000 for energy and prevailing wage consultants, $145,000 for legal and other consulting costs and $70,000 for an environmental audit for a total of about $6 million in costs that could be impacted by changes to affordable housing regulations.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to hire a consultant to design and implement. You\u2019ve got to hire a sustainability consultant, you\u2019ve got to have a compliance consultant, and you\u2019ve got to have an architect that\u2019s LEED certified,\u201d Doig said.\nDozens of design standards required by the Los Angeles County Development Authority dictate details from the number of washers and dryers in a building to the thickness of its floorboards. The goal is to prevent developers from cutting corners only to justify the lower rents, not require them to get fancy.\n\u201cIf you didn\u2019t know a lot about the industry, you might think that somebody\u2019s selling a $900 toilet seat,\u201d Wayne Beals, a Chicago Realtor who specializes in sustainable developments, said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s happening here.\u201d\nSometimes, regulations bake in goals that do not have a direct bearing on the finished apartments. Political objectives can include prevailing wage requirements, which push up labor costs in exchange for well-paying, union-backed jobs. Environmental regulations might mean developers have to include drought-resistant landscaping or energy-efficient appliances.\nThe environmental standards can, however, reduce operational costs in the long run, Beals noted.\n\u201cWe need to be building buildings that are resilient, that have a vision for a low-energy, cheap-energy future,\u201d he said.\nAnd then there are the soft costs, which tend to escalate more significantly for affordable developers. Paperwork-related costs and fees on service providers like architects, engineers, consultants and lawyers came out to about $187 per square foot for LIHTC developments compared to $84 per square foot for market-rate developments in California, according to the Rand Institute.\nPlus, there is often more community pushback on affordable projects which can drag timelines out and rack up costs.\nWhile the price gap isn\u2019t exclusive to the coasts or big cities, it does vary somewhat. In Texas, for example, the delta between market rate and affordable housing soft costs is smaller. The typical LIHTC development carries $60 per square foot in soft costs while a market rate development has about $22.\nSome states are taking action.\nIn Colorado, where state legislators have passed a series of builder-friendly policies, affordable housing developers actually carry about $50 less per square foot in total costs than market-rate developers.\nC\nutting red tape\nA recent streak of YIMBY-style policies has taken effect across the U.S., as municipalities try to make it easier to build.\nSome of the ideas are immediately controversial. Allowing the use of non-union construction for affordable housing in Chicago, for example, could be a political landmine.\nOthers have not yet proven their value, like streamlining permitting processes or clearing up other administrative hurdles that add time \u2014 and money \u2014 to a project.\nNew York City\u2019s \u201cCity of Yes\u201d initiative sheds parking minimums and legalizes\naccessory dwelling units\nin most neighborhoods. Passage by the City Council was a victory, but it\u2019s still early days in the real world.\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson issued an executive order integrating the processes for approving both residential and commercial building projects. The program, known as the \u201cCut the Tape\u201d campaign, targeted 14 different departments.\nAnd in California, some housing projects have been exempted from prevailing wage requirements and certain aspects of\nenvironmental review\n.\nWhile reforms can be helpful and drive construction costs down, they don\u2019t always address the specific delta between market-rate and affordable housing development costs.\n\u201cThe only restrictions should be that they pass inspections and that everything is done according to code,\u201d Chicago\u2019s South Side Builders Association President Andy Schcolnik said. \u201cBut they create this race where it\u2019s impossible to get to the finish line.\u201d\nPoliticians hear a different question: how many corners are they willing to cut to get more housing built as quickly as possible?\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to solve labor, we\u2019re trying to solve social inequality, we\u2019re trying to solve workforce development and we\u2019re trying to solve all this stuff with low-income housing, when really we should be trying to solve housing,\u201d Beals said, picking up a common metaphor for this approach: the everything bagel.\n\u201cI am with them on this bagel problem,\u201d he said, suggesting that housing could be exempted from having to meet such a handful of social goals. \u201cHowever, just because an everything bagel is horrible and tastes bad doesn\u2019t mean we have to have a plain bagel.\u201d\nF\ninancing fixes\nThe law of supply and demand holds in the world of affordable housing. Because of stagnant wage growth and high inflation, more Americans want affordable places to live, driving demand, while the expense of building tamps down supply.\nSome real estate players and investors are taking notice of this dynamic.\nOne is Safehold, which is creating a ground lease structure for affordable housing developers that allows them to reduce upfront development costs.\nSimilarly, the Shidler Group has begun shifting away from its business in office ground leases in favor of multifamily. In 2022 alone, the firm acquired the land under 13 multifamily properties with more than 3,900 units, which could lower starting costs.\n\u201cThese folks are seeing this as an annuity, especially for the long-term ground leases. They\u2019re saying, you know, the risk is little to none, right? This development has 1,000 people on the waiting list,\u201d Silverwood, the San Diego developer, said.\nAnother policy effort seeks to cut borrowing costs.\nAt the federal level, the nation\u2019s largest funding source for affordable housing, the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, will increase from a 9 percent subsidy to a 12 percent subsidy in 2026.\nMeanwhile, the city of Chicago established a $135 million revolving loan fund that essentially allows the city to issue low-interest loans to affordable housing developers. Interest collected on the loans goes back into the fund.\n\u201c[LIHTC] certainly comes with a lot of requirements that are imposed by the federal government in terms of how you implement the affordability portion of it and so that drives up the cost per unit,\u201d Chicago\u2019s Deputy Mayor of Economic Development Kenya Meritt said. \u201cBut when you think about our other models \u2026 those costs per unit are more in alignment with what you\u2019ll see in the private market.\u201d\nA series of units subsidized by Chicago\u2019s new \u201cMissing Middle\u201d funding program which gives grants to developers in specific neighborhoods were recently approved. They range from townhouses to six-flats, totaling 108 units across 30 buildings and are collectively valued at $39.4 million. The total cost per unit? About $365,000.",

        "content": "Shareholders searching for confirmation that Opendoor is in its new era \u2014 not-so-subtly dubbed Opendoor 2.0 \u2014 might have found it in the company\u2019s third quarter earnings.\nGone were monotone deliveries from CFO-turned-CEO Carrie Wheeler detailing the company\u2019s efforts to cut costs and improve margins. Instead, the new CEO,\nKaz Nejatian\n, in a black T-shirt emblazoned with the word \u201cFaster,\u201d spoke directly to the camera in a livestreamed presentation titled \u201cEarnings and Chill.\u201d\nNejatian, who came over from e-commerce giant Shopify where he most recently served as chief operating officer, was installed in the top spot a little less than three months ago in a populist, retail investor-driven uprising during which Opendoor\u2019s share price rose by more than 10X at one point.\nNejatian did not respond to multiple direct messages on X, to which Opendoor\u2019s press email now directs inquiries, stating that the company does not work with PR agencies \u201cas we prefer to speak for ourselves.\u201d\nBut Nejatian has been on a whirlwind tour of tech-guy podcasts, appearing on TBPN and a16z in the last few months to relate his rapid ascension.\nAs Nejatian tells it, he became \u201ca little bit obsessed with Opendoor\u201d in February, going so far as to text one of the company\u2019s co-founders, Keith Rabois, that he wanted to take the company private \u201cbecause it needs to be run better.\u201d Ultimately, Nejatian did not buy the company and instead was nominated as the new CEO by a board that now includes Rabois and former Opendoor CEO and co-founder Eric Wu, giving him his opportunity to cure what he believes ails the company. Changes so far include mandatory return-to-office, a slew of hiring changes and an AI-above-all-else mentality.\nBut while Nejatian has brought the hallmarks of the \u201cmove fast, break things\u201d ethos to a company he thinks has lost its way, it remains to be seen if he can solve the biggest problems in a business model \u2014 buying and selling homes online \u2014 that has never shown a clear path towards profitability.\nThe company traded over 27,000 homes last year, down from its peak of over 74,000 homes bought and sold in 2022.\nA\nreturn to software\nNejatian inherited a company that was managing its decline, hoping that an eventual turnaround in the housing market could spark its own aboutface. By 2025, Opendoor had fallen a long way from the\nhalcyon pre-IPO days\nof 2020.\nOpendoor had raised billions in debt and equity on the idea that it could simplify the complex world of homebuying and selling in a field called iBuying, where it stocks a marketplace with homes it has actually purchased. For sellers, the value proposition was clear: Opendoor would buy your fixer-upper without the hassle of marketing, staging and dealing with physical buyers and their emotional questions about a place they plan to live. For buyers, Opendoor was building a marketplace of homes to search and purchase near-instantly (Opendoor introduced, and later scrapped, a \u201cBuy It Now\u201d button).\nAnd for Opendoor and its investors, the company would make money on the spreads between purchase and sale price.\n\u201cThe core concept of iBuying is awesome, like it really, truly is for some homeowners that want to sell with a click of a button,\u201d industry analyst Mike DelPrete said. \u201cThe problem is nobody\u2019s yet been able to provide that awesome customer proposition and a sustainable business model.\u201d\nInterest rates skipped in 2022, leaving Opendoor holding thousands of homes it couldn\u2019t sell as the housing market cratered. Wu, who had served as CEO since 2014, stepped down at the end of 2023, and the company pulled back its buying activity drastically under Wheeler, who brought a money manager\u2019s\nmindset\nto a company that had previously been trying to hit the jackpot.\n\u201cThe core concept of iBuying is awesome, like it really, truly is for some homeowners that want to sell with a click of a button.\u201d\nMike DelPrete, industry analyst\nThe company\u2019s stock price plummeted in the following years to below $1 \u2014 in danger of\ndelisting\n\u2014 as Wheeler tried to stem the bleeding. A reversal of fortunes did not come from any shift in the business, however. Activist investor\nEric Jackson\nposted in July that his firm had taken a position in Opendoor, and retail investors jumped in. The stock tripled in one week to $2.25. It now is trading above $6, although fluctuates mightily on a daily basis.\nIts market capitalization of more than $6 billion now dwarfs its more stable competitors, including Compass, the country\u2019s largest residential brokerage.\nFrom that point on, the company \u2014 and its stock \u2014 seemed to respond more to Jackson\u2019s tweets than anything else. When he posted on Aug. 6 that he was \u201creally offended\u201d about Wheeler seeming to dismiss the retail surge, dozens of commenters chimed in and called for a new CEO. A week later,\nWheeler was out\n.\nNejatian has echoed Jackson and online commenters, claiming the company lost its way when it started focusing too much on pushing numbers around a spreadsheet.\n\u201cOur job is not to run a fucking hedge fund that aims to own assets and make money off of macroeconomics,\u201d Nejatian told the San Francisco Standard. \u201cOur job is to buy and sell lots and lots of homes at very tight spreads and make money off of transaction volume.\u201d\nNejatian follows in a long line of swearing, slouchily dressed modern tech executives who seem to believe that nobody can be a true disrupter in a starched white button down.\n\u201cI\u2019m no one\u2019s idea of a corporate executive,\u201d Nejatian, sporting yet another black T-shirt, said on the TBPN podcast. \u201cI cuss a lot, I grew up as a nerd, I didn\u2019t do all that well in my finance undergrad courses.\u201d\n\u201cThis is how I dress,\u201d he added.\nIn Nejatian\u2019s view, businesses are not built with Excel spreadsheets, do-nothing decks or wasteful meetings (at Shopify, Nejatian installed a meeting cost estimator that displayed how much the company spent on each meeting).\n\u201cWhen you go to business school, they\u2019re like, \u2018You shall have a business plan and it should be 17 pages and it should have like Porter\u2019s Five Forces on it and that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to work,\u2019\u201d he said on a podcast. \u201cAnd that\u2019s just like generally not how great businesses are built.\u201d\nNejatian, who moved to Canada at 12, has also followed the modern tech world\u2019s increasingly rightward shift. Nejatian\u2019s wife Candice Malcolm founded conservative news site True North (rebranded as Juno News), to which Nejatian and Malcolm have also contributed millions. The site came under fire for posting an interview last year with Gavin McInnes, founder of the far-right terrorist organization the Proud Boys. At Shopify, he shuttered several initiatives meant to support Black and Indigenous clients and\ncame under heat\nfrom employees over his involvement with True North and political donations.\nTo some from Nejatian\u2019s past, the changes coming to Opendoor look less like a revolution and more like the same old tricks.\n\u201cLiterally cop[y]ing what he\u2019s seen work at Shopify,\u201d one user wrote in a thread on a private forum of current and former Shopify employees shared with The Real Deal. \u201cEventually the playbook drys[sic] up and he\u2019ll be out of ideas to copy.\u201d\n\u201cHe pushed NFT real hard,\u201d another wrote. \u201cUsing AI for everything is not vision; it\u2019s wishful thinking.\u201d\n\u201cOmg he\u2019s going to be CEO???\u201d another wrote on a thread about news of his move. \u201cRIP to Opendoor.\u201d\nLike other politically conservative bosses, he is likely now leading a group of employees that skew liberal, one former Opendoor employee pointed out.\nN\new model\nSo far, Nejatian has focused publicly on getting the company back to its tech roots and shipping products faster. In October, Opendoor launched a warranty feature for homebuyers, which allows them to return a home if they don\u2019t like it within seven days.\n\u201cWe are ditching manager mode,\u201d Nejatian said on the company earnings calls. \u201cWe\u2019re now firmly in founder mode. We are refounding this company. This is Opendoor 2.0.\u201d\nAnd the company has significantly ramped up its contract activity, according to a new dashboard on its website showing weekly purchases. In the first two weeks of November, Opendoor had contracts to buy an average of 282 homes per week, more than double its weekly rate over the summer.\nIn many ways, Nejatian appears to be trying to Elon Musk-ify the company, all the way down to his gaudy incentive-laden compensation package, layoffs and the relentless updates on X about progress. Nejatian is getting paid $1 in annual salary but\nstands to make\nup to $2.8 billion in equity incentives.\n\u201cOur job is not to run a fucking hedge fund that aims to own assets and make money off of macroeconomics.\u201d\nKaz Nejatian\nIn September, Nejatian shared a memo sent to Opendoor employees that required employees to \u201cdefault to AI\u201d in their job. \u201cWe need to move faster \u2014 always. And we can\u2019t do that without being AI obsessed,\u201d he\nwrote\n. \u201cSo, starting today the first line in everyone\u2019s job expectation is simply this: Default to AI\u201d\nAfter the company\u2019s\nthird-quarter earnings\ncall, Nejatian posted that he was buying an additional $1M in stock.\nThe frenzied activity and posting has been the kind of thing that has kept the \u201c$OPEN Army,\u201d the nickname for the company\u2019s rabid retail investors, charging the front lines.\nWhen TRD reached out in a popular Discord server for Opendoor investors, one of the few responses was: \u201copendoor to the moon is all you need.\u201d\nNejatian gave investors \u2014 both retail and institutional \u2014 a hard deadline for profitability: the end of next year. The company bought down over $200 million in convertible notes to clean up its balance sheet and issued tradable warrants with strike prices starting at $9 to cozy up to retail investors still riding the wave.\nAt the same time, Nejatian has been emphatic in his belief that Opendoor can be a \u201cgenerational business,\u201d the Amazon of home sales. It just needs the inventory, then the buyers will flood in to buy and sell homes, but also get their mortgages, insurance and who knows what else.\nIndustry insiders think we\u2019ve seen this show before.\u00a0Zillow and Redfin also got into iBuying, and Zillow ultimately lost more $1 billion in less than four years before shuttering its program in 2021.\n\u201cWe did this experiment,\u201d Jack Miller, president and CEO of T3 Sixty, a real estate management consulting firm, said. \u201cWe discovered there\u2019s a certain amount of appetite in the market for a high-convenience sale, and now it\u2019s just making that business be really performant and efficient and scaled correctly for the amount of demand.\u201d\n\u201cThe question is, is it a niche thing, or is it going to become a mainstream phenomenon that significantly changes how people sell houses and then buy houses in the future?\u201d Brian Boero, CEO of consulting firm 1000watt, added.\nOne of Nejatian\u2019s ideas is the tokenization of real estate transactions.\n\u201cAsset tokenization is not a side quest for us,\u201d he said on the earnings call. \u201cTokenization allows us to increase the speed of transactions, decrease the cost of transactions, and broaden the base of homeownership.\u201d\nThat belief goes back to a core principle of Opendoor, that real estate can be commoditized, stripped away of money-grubbing agents and mortgage brokers and as easy as ordering sesame chicken on your phone.\n\u201cIn the future, buying a home will be as seamless as buying a car from Tesla,\u201d Nejatian said. \u201cYou\u2019ll choose your home, your financing, your warranty, your insurance, all in one place, all in one flow. Right now, homeowners have to deal with a bunch of different companies, brokers, agents, a lot of different stuff to get what they need for a house. That doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\nBut DelPrete, who tracked Opendoor 1.0\u2019s downfall, said disrupting a complex and outdated industry like real estate isn\u2019t that simple.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to say, we\u2019re going to use software and AI to streamline the process and bring costs down, but you can\u2019t use software and AI to replace the fact that there\u2019s an actual home involved, with a basement and flooring and curtains and carpet and staging and real estate agents,\u201d DelPrete said.\nTo a certain degree, Nejatian, who openly grimaces at Corporatespeak, has relied on the buzzwords of a different part of the business world, replacing \u201csynergy\u201d and \u201cheadwinds\u201d with \u201cAI\u201d and \u201ctokenization.\u201d\nIf he can find a way to turn those words into tangible changes to one of the largest industries in the world, he could in fact have a generational business on his hands. If not, he\u2019ll hear it in the retail investor forums.",

        "content": "Mehrdad Moayedi\u2019s rise mirrors the story of the city he played a leading role in shaping: Both were plopped into the middle of the North Texas prairie without much by way of resources. They figured out how to harness the wave of growth, resist its undertow and get really, really big.\nMoayedi was 15 when he left Tehran for a small suburb of Fort Worth in 1976. He made the move ahead of his mother and stepfather, an Air Force pilot who worked at Bell Helicopter, transferring from a small Seventh Day Adventist academy in Iran to a high school with 2,500 students that could have inspired a \u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d set.\nHe still remembers his first day at L.D. Bell High School: he showed up to what must\u2019ve been a sea of denim bellbottoms in a dress shirt and tie. He was scared.\nIt didn\u2019t last long. Moayedi ditched the tie but kept his Persian last name. He made a ton of friends, played sports, converted to Christianity and, over the course of 50 years, became arguably the most prolific single-family lot developer in North Texas.\nDespite being many miles from a coastline or useful riverway, Dallas-Forth Worth has\ngrown like a weed\nduring Moayedi\u2019s time here. Between 1970 and 2025, its population more than tripled from 2.4 million to 8.6 million. Satellite imagery timelapse shows the region unfolding in all directions with notable visible changes at the end of each year.\nThroughout his career, his Farmers Branch-based firm\nCenturion American Development Group\nhas developed more than 200,000 lots spanning about 75,000 acres. This year, the firm\npurchased 1,100 acres\nfor a project in Grayson County, 630 acres for a community in north Fort Worth and 550 acres as part of the Preston Harbor development on Lake Texoma.\nIf you combined all Moayedi\u2019s communities into one, the expanse would almost cover the city of Philadelphia. But they\u2019re not contiguous. Instead, the wall-sized map in the company\u2019s conference room shows Centurion American dots in every growth corridor of the ever-expanding region.\nWhile single-family lot development and master-planned communities make up the majority of his business today, he\u2019s also dabbled in condo development, historic preservation and adaptive reuse.\nThe tale of his rise has a cast of big real estate players. D.R. Horton co-founder Terry Horton took him to church on Sundays. Herman Smith, the Fort Worth developer who was president of the National Association of Homebuilders, gave him landscaping jobs.\nMoayedi is known for his affability, but you don\u2019t get to where he\u2019s sitting without picking up some rivals. His foes are heavy-hitters, too, like Kyle Bass, the hedge fund manager featured in Michael Lewis\u2019 \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d who has spent years trying to uncover what he believes are fraudulent dealings between Centurion American and a former lender, United Development Fund IV.\nMoayedi has faced his share of legal scrutiny, some ongoing, but he\u2019s so far emerged unscathed, allowing him to earn a place among the icons who mentored him.\n\u201cThere will never be another one of him,\u201d said Trevor Kollinger, Centurion American\u2019s vice president of finance and development and the closest Moayedi has to an appointed successor.\nMoayedi wouldn\u2019t be able to typify \u201cthe developer\u201d in a place that valorizes the red-blooded, denim-clad cowboy without getting the buy-in of the OGs. He respects their roots.\nTake Sean Terry, the tobacco-spitting former mayor of\nCelina\nwho handles land entitlements for Centurion American and is his family\u2019s sixth generation in Collin County.\n\u201cI do have respect for him in a different way, because his parents settled here. They did all the hard work to make this what it is. I do owe them something, and for that reason, I\u2019m very mindful of it,\u201d Moayedi said.\nStill, Terry insists, his immigrant boss is \u201cmore American than I am.\u201d\nA\ngravitational personality\n\u201cThe best motivation is poverty,\u201d Moayedi said, so when the Iranian Revolution of 1978 wiped out his family\u2019s financial stability, he dropped out of college at the University of Texas at Arlington and got to work.\nHe started a landscaping company, drawing on his experience doing lawns in high school. No one was paying attention to the greenery at spec houses at the time, so Moayedi proposed a deal: He\u2019d do the yard, and the builder could pay him when the house sold.\nThat\u2019s how he got connected with builders like Herman Smith and Don and Terry Horton, the men who would become his mentors. Ask him how chance meetings became lifelong relationships, and he makes it sound simple, \u201cHe took a liking to me.\u201d\nDavid Craig, his longtime friend and collaborator on the upcoming Preston Harbor development on Lake Texoma, highlights another factor in the equation: his ability to deliver.\n\u201cBelieve me, you can\u2019t accomplish that just by being friendly,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to perform and that\u2019s what he\u2019s done.\u201d\nMoayedi landed his first real development opportunity in the late \u201980s. John Dees, the father of his friend Michael Dees, had this swath of land in Grapevine called Windsor Forest. Wanting to retire, the elder Dees gave Moayedi a shot at developing it. When he completed it, he was short $600,000. How was he going to quickly pay the debt? Another deal, of course.\n\u201cYou may be working for technically nothing for five, six, seven, eight years, until you get to the final phase. That\u2019s when the profits maybe start come rolling in, and you feel like maybe it was worthwhile for the first several years or so.\u201d\nRex Glendenning\nHe drove around the Metroplex, scouting. He discovered a 60-acre development site, cold-called the owner and was faced with a new challenge: a 15-day deadline to come up with $6 million to buy the land. One friend agreed to lend him the money, but when it wasn\u2019t enough for the full cost of development, another friend \u2014 Herman Smith, the builder \u2014 connected Moayedi with another developer, who agreed to do the work and accept payment when Moayedi sold the lots.\n\u201cSo, I didn\u2019t have any money. Somebody gave me money from land. The other guy gave me the development money. I got it done. I did a good job with it. I sold everything. I paid the $600 [thousand] back. Now I had about half a million dollars cash and was off to the races,\u201d Moayedi said.\nMoayedi took business detours into infrastructure, manufacturing and utility work before settling his focus on development. He always comes back to the land, which, in his hands, becomes Centurion American\u2019s signature master-planned communities. The transformation is satisfying to him.\n\u201cAfter I\u2019m gone, my kids can drive by and say, \u2018My dad built that,\u2019\u201d he said.\nMoayedi\u2019s legacy depends on his affability. His friends relay his unfailing generosity. Even a former partner who named him in a lawsuit couldn\u2019t muster up anything bad to say about him, though whether that\u2019s just good Texan manners is hard to say.\n\u201cEverything has translated back to relationships,\u201d Kollinger said. \u201cHe has that gravitational personality that you feel right off the bat.\u201d His Christmas party brings all his friends together. He used to hold the party in Downtown Dallas; since his 2022 purchase of Southfork Ranch in Parker, he now throws the bash there, in a mansion made famous by the show \u201cDallas.\u201d\nBut he doesn\u2019t operate like someone who knows he\u2019s charming. He squirms in front of a camera and says what he means. He\u2019s also got the emotional acuity of a man whose closest family members are women. He tears up talking about his mother, Behjat McElroy, who died in 2024, calling her \u201cthe smartest person I knew\u201d and praises the skills of his sister Mahtab Moayedi, a developer based in California. He gushes about his two daughters, Lily and Sarah, both in college in California.\nOnce, he was swimming with friends in Grapevine Lake and came across a man who was living in his car with a baby. Moayedi invited them to stay at his house. The guy ended up working for Moayedi as a mason and eventually took over his masonry business.\nWhy would a guy in his twenties trying to make it in real estate offer up a room to a stranger? \u201cIt just seemed like the right thing to do at the time,\u201d he said.\nC\nenturion American\nLike any good Texan, Moayedi credits his success to the grace of God. As Moayedi tells it, God opened up deals for him and guided him through each challenge.\nInvocations of the divine undersell how good he is at making deals.\n\u201cMehrdad\u2019s the consummate deal junkie,\u201d said \u201cKing of Dirt\u201d Rex Glendenning. The longtime friends have worked together for decades, most notably on the $4.5 billion Legacy Hills development in Celina.\nMoayedi founded Centurion American Development Group in 1990. Today, the company has 155 employees. Master-planned communities form the bulk of the firm\u2019s business.\nThe development process typically starts with Glendenning identifying a piece of raw land that he thinks would make a good site. If Moayedi agrees, the next step is to get the land entitled, which involves working with the local zoning commission and city council.\nMoayedi was the first developer to use a financing model called a Public Improvement District (PID) after the state legislature authorized it in 2007, and he often creates this or similar public-private partnerships to offset the costs of infrastructure development. This whole process might take six months, Glendenning said. Then it\u2019s time to bid out the infrastructure and build roads, add utilities and plan amenities centers.\nMoayedi runs the bids against what builders will pay for lots to determine what\u2019s profitable. That\u2019s when homebuilder friends like D.R. Horton come into the picture \u2014 they purchase lots and then build and sell homes.\nOn a 1,000-acre deal, it can take 15 years to build a master-planned community. The profit doesn\u2019t come until the end.\n\u201cYou may be working for technically nothing for five, six, seven, eight years, until you get to the final phase,\u201d Glendenning said. \u201cThat\u2019s when the profits maybe start come rolling in, and you feel like maybe it was worthwhile for the first several years or so.\u201d\nThese communities are Centurion American\u2019s bread and butter, but he\u2019s tried other ventures.\nHe made a splash more than a decade ago when he purchased the iconic Statler Hotel and Residences in downtown Dallas, drawn to the history of the landmark. The Statler had introduced consumers to amenities like elevator music and televisions in each room when it opened in 1956, registering Coco Chanel and Ike and Tina Turner as guests.\nAfter closing in 2001, water damage and vandalism meant the hotel\u2019s only visitors were of the rodent variety. Moayedi was the latest in a series of developers who tried to bring the gem back to life over the course of about a decade. With the help of nearly $50 million in incentives from the City of Dallas, he completed the $230 million project in 2017, turning the dilapidated structure into a 159-key hotel with 219 luxury multifamily units, revamped event space, restaurants and retail.\n\u201cThat job has been probably one of the hardest jobs that I\u2019ve done. I\u2019ve hung in there, because it\u2019s important to me for the city of Dallas,\u201d he said.\nHe also bought the Residences at the Stoneleigh out of bankruptcy and finished out the condo tower. At the old Dallas Public Library, he converted the space into offices.\nThe firm\u2019s largest projects are ahead. Centurion American is four years into the redevelopment of Collin Creek Mall, which Moayedi is transforming into a mixed-use development with more than 3,000 housing units, 1.3 million square feet of office space and 300,000 square feet of retail. He also has the $7 billion Lake Texoma project with Craig.\nHis process for picking what he works on outside of master-planned community development comes from instinct, some combination of emotion and logic.\n\u201cI kind of go by the seat of my pants,\u201d Moayedi said.\nIt\u2019s the same looseness for his own home purchases, and he buys and sells residences frequently. His office has a pool going on how long he\u2019ll stay at the house he moved into less than a year ago in Highland Park. The wagers are in months.\n\u201cI get bored of things,\u201d he said.\nA\nsystem that works for him\nMoayedi and DFW wouldn\u2019t have had a prayer of such large-scale impact without the state\u2019s signature pro-business ethos.\nThat, combined with the boost he\u2019s gotten from mentors and his natural inclination to help others, have made Moayedi into something of a gentleman\u2019s capitalist. The system, as he sees it, works properly when people are free to make money and give it back.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what this country does. You look at most of the people in this country that are billionaires, 95 percent give it back in a good way,\u201d he said.\nHe donates to causes related to war veterans with particular passion and has teamed up with community leaders like state Sen. Royce West to connect kids with professional mentors.\nThe worldview involves respect for local history. He\u2019s aware that longtime North Texans could perceive him as an outsider swooping in and capitalizing off the hard work of people who\u2019ve invested in their communities here for centuries.\n\u201cSome people could think, \u2018Hey, who is this guy to benefit off our fathers and grandfathers?\u2019 I\u2019m very humble about it, and also I know that I\u2019ve been given a right. I\u2019ve been given a blessing, so I need to be right about it.\u201d\nAll this makes him a Republican. But his geniality means his circle is wide; some of the \u201cgreat men\u201d in his life are Democrats, he said, and he gets along with them, too.\nMoayedi, who purchased a jet from President Donald Trump in 2024, keeps evidence of his Trump support all over his office, including a half-dozen framed photographs with the president. The glittery lion\u2019s-head sculpture on Moayedi\u2019s desk wears a MAGA hat. (Not a diehard, he also displays a photo of himself with Mike Pence and a copy of Nikki Haley\u2019s book.)\nHe plays an active role in preserving the state\u2019s pro-developer conditions he credits for his success, donating handsomely to Republicans at every level of politics and even a few Democrats.\nMoayedi\u2019s political activity invited scrutiny over the summer when it became clear that he donated $25,000 to Tarrant County Commissioner Manny Ramirez and $10,000 to Tarrant County Judge Tim O\u2019Hare in 2023 before seeking approval for a public improvement district in the county.\nIt doesn\u2019t take an ethicist to question the optics. But this is Texas, a state where the legislator who spearheaded state property tax reform owns a company that helps people lower their tax bills, and the veil between business and politics can be thin.\nO\nn Bass\u2019 bad side\nThe last 10 years have been Moayedi\u2019s most successful but also some of his more private. He hasn\u2019t really done the rounds in the press since completing the Statler in 2017.\nThe period of increased privacy coincided with a bruising public legal battle that drew Moayedi into the fray but hasn\u2019t knocked him over.\nMoayedi may not have many enemies, but the people who have issues with him are pretty persistent. One of them is Kyle Bass. In 2015, Bass started shorting stocks of United Development Fund IV, one of Centurion American\u2019s lenders, based on allegations that the fund was a Ponzi scheme. Bass claimed UDF was using new investor money to pay existing investors in faltering earlier funds. He also argued UDF\u2019s biggest borrower, Centurion American, was complicit. Bass also thought the two parties got too cozy, pointing to the fact that Moayedi once owned a jet with now-imprisoned former UDF CEO Hollis Greenlaw.\nBass called the Federal Bureau of Investigation with his evidence and presented his case anonymously on the website Harvest Exchange. His argument got picked up and made the rounds online, resulting in plummeting UDF shares, an FBI raid of UDF\u2019s corporate offices and ultimately, a $30 million windfall to Bass.\nLater, a federal jury convicted four UDF executives on 10 counts, including conspiracy to commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and securities fraud. They were sentenced to a combined 20 years in prison.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission and FBI investigated the claims, and Moayedi was never charged with anything. Still, Bass was unsatisfied with the SEC\u2019s findings and bought stakes in multiple Centurion American projects in an effort to do his own digging into the company.\nHe declined an interview for this story, writing in an email, \u201cI\u2019ve decided when I don\u2019t have anything positive to say about someone \u2026 I shouldn\u2019t say anything.\u201d\nThe ordeal spurred additional legal challenges, including from Zack and Aaron Ipour, the founders of DFW homebuilder Megatel Homes. Megatel sued Moayedi in 2020, claiming UDF participated in a scheme to prop up Moayedi\u2019s companies and defraud Megatel. The matter is still ongoing and will likely go to trial.\nThe Ipour brothers also sued to block the redevelopment of Collin Creek Mall, claiming they had the right of first refusal to buy the property. A jury ruled in favor of Moayedi, finding that Megatel had given up its priority.\nMoayedi is also fighting a suit from Dallas-based REIT and UDF shareholder NexPoint on similar grounds to the wrapped-up FBI and SEC investigations. NexPoint claims Moayedi participated in an \u201celaborate scheme of fake transactions\u201d in which UDF would make a loan to a new Centurion American project, whose proceeds Moayedi would use to make a payment due on a loan he\u2019d taken out from UDF for an earlier project. Jeff Tillotson, the attorney for both clients, also represents Kyle Bass. \u201cI have a great deal of respect for Mr. Moayedi, but the clients who\u2019ve come to me have had interests averse to him,\u201d Tillotson said to The Real Deal.\nIn a Nov. 18 filing, a Texas Supreme Court judge determined Texas doesn\u2019t have jurisdiction over the matter and directed the court to dismiss the case.\nMoayedi wasn\u2019t afraid to jump into the fray to defend against the accusations, even issuing a statement at the time calling the Megatel suit \u201ca sign of a desperate man grasping for a lifeline.\u201d Today, he handles questions about the period with characteristic geniality.\n\u201cI\u2019m one of those guys, I\u2019ll take my punches, sit in front of people and do what I\u2019ve gotta do. We were okay. God looked at it. The authorities looked at it,\u201d he said.\nHe lets out a pained yelp and a dark chuckle when he recalls the legal bills involved in the court brawl. But his business quadrupled in the time period when the legal battle stretched on, he said.\nW\nhat\u2019s next\nMoayedi doesn\u2019t dwell much on the past though. When he isn\u2019t working, he cheers on FC Dallas, the Dallas Cowboys and the Mavericks, or travels to California to visit his daughters. He\u2019s rebuilding the Malibu home he bought in 2020 that was destroyed by the Palisades Fire in January. He recently took the longest vacation of his career, a 15-day trip to the south of France.\nHe doesn\u2019t seem to ruminate about the future either.\nIf and when the founder steps back, Kollinger \u2014 the implied successor \u2014 imagines a board of directors could make decisions about the kind of one-off projects Moayedi pursued by gut or instinct. Kollinger himself would be comfortable leading the land development business, he said. It shows no sign of slowing, as master-planned community developments veer\ncloser and closer to\nOklahoma.\nThe best perspective on Moayedi\u2019s impact comes as you make your final descent into the world\u2019s third-busiest airport. From that vantage, the sea of rooftops arranges itself along suburban streets like dominoes, against a background of pavement and emerald backyards.\nNot everyone adores the look of suburban sprawl. Moayedi shrugs off complaints about the aesthetics. He\u2019s the land guy, not the architect.\n\u201cPrice dictates what you can actually build,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of people sitting on the sidelines, being critical of things, but it\u2019s very important to have a roof over your head, good schools, a place you can go hang out, parks and all that.\u201d",

        "content": "What can real estate learn from Rochester? More than you might think.\nAbout what not to do, that is.\nUpstate cities such as Rochester, Syracuse and Utica declined as industry retrenched or moved to the South or overseas. New York City\u2019s large manufacturing base was also gutted, with employment in that sector plunging from 1 million jobs to about 55,000.\nYet New York City\u2019s economy grew while its upstate counterparts withered away.\nWhy haven\u2019t upstate cities been able to reinvent themselves as New York City did?\nX user @PhilSustainable got me thinking that poor land-use policy is a big part of upstate cities\u2019 problems.\nSpecifically, huge swaths of upstate cities are devoted to parking. These innumerable masses of macadam spread people apart and sap life from what should be urban centers.\n\u201cSyracuse has a world-class collection of parking spots. Sadly, they\u2019re mostly empty space,\u201d PhilSustainable\ntweeted\n. \u201cImagine if that sea of asphalt was a sea of tall multifamily homes with corner stores and retail. Syracuse can put its land back to work and be rich.\u201d\nHe punctuated his point with four photos:\nThen he turned his attention 90 miles west.\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy seeing parking lots in Downtown Rochester. The city should be as rich as Brooklyn today, but chose pavement instead.\u201d\nThe photos are just brutal:\nFor all the New York Post headlines about people fleeing New York City, its population has remained relatively high. Between the Great Financial Crisis and the pandemic, it surged by more than 700,000 people to just above 8.8 million. It\u2019s upstate\u2019s losses that have reduced the state\u2019s number of House districts from\n45\nin the 1940s to 26 today.\nI don\u2019t want to give our city policymakers too much credit. The street grid and transit system were here long before they were. And the city has only recently begun to\nget rid of parking mandates\n; it has only avoided having lots of surface lots because land was too expensive to create them.\nAnd although high demand to live in the city pushed our population count up, it would have risen by even more \u2014 and rents by less \u2014 if elected officials hadn\u2019t preserved parking mandates and low-density zoning across 70 percent of the city.\nBut at least the city didn\u2019t do what upstate cities did, embracing the notion that the local economy depends on people being able to park for free within 50 feet of their destination.\nThe photos above show what all that empty space produces: a whole lot of nothing.\n",

        "content": "Carlos Saavedra was hoping for a repeat.\nStanding on the roof of a converted multifamily property on Clinton Street in Brooklyn Heights, Saavedra points to a brick building on Sidney Place with a nearly-abutting back lot.\u00a0He\u2019s planning to do something similar there to the Clinton Street property he converted into a single-family townhouse and hopes to sell for an unnamed \u2014 but sure to be astronomical \u2014 price.\nSaavedra, a co-head of developer Eckstrom\n, says he thinks Brooklyn Heights could use more condos. But the single-family opportunity proved too hard to resist.\nHe\u2019s not the only developer who has started to see piles of cash in the shape of stately townhouses when a vacant lot or multifamily property hits the market. Brooklyn Heights is an epicenter of the phenomenon, where\ndevelopers like Saavedra\nhave sought to use the momentum from big-ticket deals for renovated homes to build their own tricked-out single-family offerings.\nDevelopers in the area are following a flow of affluent New Yorkers to Brooklyn and a surprisingly resilient luxury market across the city that have spurred relentless price growth in the borough\u2019s in-demand neighborhoods.\nIn Brownstone Brooklyn, which includes luxury-heavy neighborhoods like Cobble Hill and Park Slope, the average price per square foot was up 16 percent in the third quarter from the same time last year to reach $2,231. That mark set an all-time record, which is something that has happened more often than not each quarter for the last two years,\naccording to appraiser Miller Samuel\n.\nBut the seemingly uncapped upside for single-families might be finally hitting its imported-Danish-wood ceiling, with some projects seeking record-setting prices now starting to linger on the market.\nAnd developers like Saavedra have been eying newcomers warily, concerned that their carefully manicured reputations will suffer from imitators trying to make a quick buck.\n\u201cIt almost seems like we make it look easy, but it really is not easy,\u201d he said. \u201cJust one developer not doing a good product \u2014 it\u2019s really bad for all of us.\u201d\nWhen the price and timing are right\nBrownstone Brooklyn\u2019s cramped streets have attracted attention before the current spate of developers trying their hands at single-family homes.\nThe Kushner Companies secured a six-property portfolio in\nBrooklyn Heights for $36.5 million in 2014\n, turning three of the buildings that had served as multi-family homes into rentals.\nBut the Kushners may have overestimated the upside in the area at the time. One of the homes on 100 Pierrepont Street, which the company bought for roughly $6 million, gut renovated and listed for $10 million in 2017 \u2014 only to sell the 5,900-square-foot house for $6.4 million four years later after a series of price cuts.\nBut developers who have flocked to the area in recent years say price points have risen to the point where newly-built townhouses can pencil out.\nJon Schippers, whose firm, Steering House, takes on projects in various iterations of developer, architect, builder or all three, said he \u201cjust couldn\u2019t find very good deals\u201d around Brooklyn Heights, even when he was looking for \u201cportfolio pieces.\u201d But now, $15 to $20 million sellouts are feasible.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be too aggressive and say it\u2019s a sure thing, but you can easily comp that,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven that, it makes it a lot easier to pull the trigger on certain asking prices.\u201d\nSchippers\u2019 firm worked as the builder on the Brooklyn Home Company\u2019s renovation at 1 Sidney Place,\nwhich sold for $22.1 million last year\n, the second-most expensive sale in Brooklyn.\n\u201cIt used to be that clients were coming to our active work area looking for good value, and now most of the time, that client cares very little about money and wants the best,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re designing developments, we\u2019re thinking a lot less about the budget and a lot more about designing and building something really unique and one of a kind.\u201d\nThe appetite in the luxury segment, where all-cash buyers remain undeterred by high mortgage rates, has far outpaced everything else. In the first nine months of this year, luxury sales in Brooklyn rose by over 23 percent from 2024, compared to just a 2 percent increase in the rest of the market.\nAt 170 Clinton, which Saavedra bought for $4.75 million in 2023, Eckstrom had initially scoped out doing five floor-through condos in the building, which used to be a 10-unit multifamily. But he dropped the plan to two units after seeing that buyers of the larger units were going to be less affected by rates.\nThe switch to a single-family came by chance, after a subcontractor knocked down a back wall by mistake. Rather than wait for approval from the attorney general\u2019s office on an offering plan \u2014 contingent on approval from the Landmarks Preservation Committee \u2014 Saavedra tried marketing the whole building as a single-family and put the home into contract over one year ago with a\nlast asking price of $14 million\n.\nA boom in progress\nSchippers is currently in the midst of building a 4,700-square-foot passive house at 33 Joralemon Street and looking to find a buyer willing to pay a hefty price point for the opportunity to have a say in most of the finishes. He also has another pre-construction project on Pierrepont Street.\nHis projects are a few in a rising wave that has dotted the neighborhood with scaffolding. In 2024, the Department of Buildings fielded 118 job applications for Brooklyn Heights and surrounding areas that involved converting a lot into a single-family home, up from just 42 applications in 2019.\n\u201cI have investors calling me all the time, looking for buildings in the neighborhood,\u201d said James Lee Wall, a broker with specialty townhouse firm Leslie Garfield. \u201cThey\u2019re actively pursuing buildings that they think can make a big turnaround.\u201d\nBut asking prices and closed deals are two different things.\nDeveloper Vladem Brodsky listed two of his projects, at 295 and 299 Hicks Street, for $26 million and $18 million. The offering at 295 Hicks Street, which he bought for just over $4 million in 2021, sat on the market for six months before it was rented, while the asking price for the home at 299 Hicks Street dropped from $18 million last year to $15 million this year. (Brodsky did not respond to multiple requests for comment).\nThe homes lingering on the market speak to the idiosyncratic nature of single-family development, where homes need to feel one-of-a-kind but not \u201cstick out like a sore thumb,\u201d according to Schippers.\nAnd while Brooklyn Heights seems to be an incubator for eight-figure homes, not all blocks in the neighborhood are created equal, which makes a difference when developers are trying to seek top-of-market prices.\n\u201cSometimes the mistake developers make is that they\u2019ll try to get the same A+ prices on a B- location,\u201d said Compass\u2019 Noah Plener.\nJust a couple hundred feet can change the calculation, according to Saavedra. Such could have been the case at 307 Hicks Street, which sits two blocks north of the main thoroughfare Atlantic Avenue, and went into contract asking $15.5 million at the end of last year.\n\u201cIf this house was the next block over, a little bit closer to Atlantic, we would have definitely not done one-family,\u201d he said of 307 Hicks.\nWall also questioned the $18.5 million asking price at 175 Clinton Street. The underway project is located next to the Key Foods on Atlantic Avenue, a potential noise pollution concern and value killer. \u201cThat\u2019s aspirational, but this is what developers are seeing in the neighborhood,\u201d he said.\nBrooklyn Heights still has more room to grow with a host of projects expected to be seeking big numbers. But the neighborhood could also serve as a blueprint for projects and developers in other corners of the borough where prices are rising, but the luxury townhouse market is still in its nascent stages.\nBrodsky this summer\nset a neighborhood price record\nin Fort Greene, where he purchased a townhouse at 39 South Portland Avenue for $4.7 million with plans to create condos before a buyer offered $8.8 million in all-cash for the unfinished home.\nAt the corner of Berry and Second streets in Williamsburg, Lior Barak and Christine Blackburn snagged a deal in July for a 5,500-square-foot home they developed on an empty lot asking $10 million. The contract was the\nmost expensive deal for a residence\nin the neighborhood by nearly 20 percent.\nIn Greenpoint, a landmarked townhome was initially converted into two condo units but\nsold to a single buyer as a two-family for $6.9 million\nin July, shattering the neighborhood\u2019s price record.",

You can see the top 10 multifamily sales in Pasadena for the first nine months by clicking\nhere\n.\nThe deal for the 140-unit four-story Pasadena Gateway Villas at 290 North Hudson Avenue equated to $428,571 per unit.\nBrokers Kevin Shannon, Chris Benton, Ken White, Dean Zander, Mitch Clarfield and Anthony Muhlstein of Newmark represented the seller. Newmark\u2019s Gabe Munson represented the buyer.\nIt is a \u201cstandout asset\u201d due to \u201cits strong fundamentals \u2014 favorable transaction size, prime location and strategic positioning,\u201d Benton said in a\nstatement\n.\nThe property drew more than 40 offers because its location in Pasadena means it is not subject to the City of\u00a0 Los Angeles\u2019 Measure ULA real estate transfer tax, Shannon said.\nThe voter-approved \u201cmansion tax,\u201d which went into effect on April 1, 2023, imposes a 4 percent fee on all property sales above $5 million and a 5.5 percent fee on sales above $10 million with in the L.A. city limits.\nHines reportedly has a \u201cvalue-add plan\u201d for the 23-year-old Pasadena complex, Benton said, including an overhaul intended to add resort-style offerings at the 1.6 acre-propert..\nPasadena Gateway Villas \u2014 set in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains \u2014 includes studio to three-bedroom units marketed to the city\u2019s higher-end renter base.\nApartments come with gas fireplaces, in-unit washers and dryers, private balconies or patios and vaulted ceilings.

        "content": "Texas\ncommercial real estate distress\nis closing out the year with a bang as lenders appear eager to offload troubled properties before 2026.\nFor months, the value of Texas CRE loans flagged for each monthly foreclosure sale has hovered around $600 million. In December, it shot up to more than $900 million, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service.\nOf the $911 million in loans scheduled for auction, $659 million is tied to multifamily properties. Plus, multiple loans flagged earlier this year but were never sold appear headed back to auction block, like\nCharles Cohen\u2019s design center\nat 5120 Woodway Drive, which was originally headed to auction in June and July.\nHarris County, home to Houston, is reliably the hardest hit and was again this month, with 11 loans topping $250 million, but, this month, the rest of the Texas Triangle isn\u2019t far behind.\nNearly $180 million worth of loans faces foreclosure in Bexar County, where San Antonio is located. Travis County, home to Austin, is inching closer, too, with $168 million worth of loans allegedly in default.\nHere are the biggest loans up for auction this month. It\u2019s possible that some of these borrowers and lenders will reach agreements to avoid auction.\nHouston\nFannie Mae has already filed a\nlawsuit against Jon Venetos\n\u2019 troubled firm Lurin Capital, claiming he defaulted on the $77.2 million loan tied to Latitude 2976, a 734-unit apartment complex at 201 and 301 Wilcrest Drive. While many floundering multifamily investors can blame the distress on unpredictable floating-rate loans, Venetos can\u2019t; the Fannie Mae loan had a fixed rate of 5.1 percent.\nThe lender is poised to try to seize control of the property at this month\u2019s foreclosure auction. The debt works out to $105,177 per unit for the property built in 1976.\nAustin\nAri Rastegar could lose four Austin apartment complexes at the December sale in Austin. The properties are tied to a $22.7 million loan from Greystone. The loan is backed by Hyde Park Square, a 48-unit complex at 206 West 38th Street; Sunset Palms, a 36-unit complex at 902 Romeria Drive; The Chateau, a 30-unit complex at 1211 West 8th Street; and The Highlander, a 49-unit complex at 803-809 Tirado Street. The debt works out to $139,263 per unit.\nRastegar said the foreclosure is the result of a \u201cknock-down, drag-out fight with the lender,\u201d a dispute he plans to continue litigating even if he loses the properties. He added that the properties are such a small percentage of his portfolio.\nSan Antonio\nLynd Living\u2019s Copper Mill Apartments is scheduled to be auctioned off this month. The 344-unit apartment complex at 5827 Northwest Loop 410 was built in 1980. Lynd allegedly defaulted on a $34.3 million loan, part of a collateralized loan obligation issued by Franklin BSP Realty Trust. The debt works out to $99,709 per unit.\nDallas\nThis biggest new loan flagged for foreclosure in Dallas County is the $24.2 million mortgage tied to Tesoro at 12 Apartments, a 184-unit apartment complex 4271 Altoona Drive. Arbor provided the loan for the property built in 1984. The borrower is an entity tied to a group of investors, including Ce Shi, Matthew Picheny and Stephen Lee-Thomas. The loan works out to $131,521 per unit.\nFort Worth\nAnother property is on the chopping block for\nbeleaguered syndicator Tides Equities\n. The firm, which has been shedding properties via forced sales for multiple years now, could lose one more before the end of the year. Tides allegedly defaulted on a $32.8 million loan, part of a collateralized loan obligation issued by Franklin BSP Realty Trust. The loan is backed by Tides at Westcreek, a 272-unit apartment complex at 6776 Westcreek Drive in Fort Worth. The debt works out to $120,588 per unit for the property built in 1984.\nTides partnered with Pecos Housing Finance Corporation to get property tax breaks on the property, using a loophole known as a \u201ctraveling\u201d housing finance corporation. Tides sold the property to Pecos Housing Finance Corporation, an affordable housing organization more than 300 miles from Fort Worth, and leased the ground. Gov. Greg Abbott\nsigned a bill\nclosing the loophole, which became a popular cost-cutting tool for multifamily syndicators and investors.\nDenton\nFrisco-based Jordan Multifamily\ncould lose five student housing communities\ntied to a $55.5 million loan from Argentic Real Estate Finance. The portfolio includes: a 79-unit complex at 911 Bernard Street; an 80-unit complex at 707 Bernard Street; an 81-unit complex at 1607 West Live Oak Street; an 82-unit complex at 1003 Eagle Drive; and an 83-unit complex at 2424 West Oak Street. The portfolio comprises 405 units; the loan works out to $137,037 per unit. Jordan purchased the properties in 2022. They were built between 1962 and 1975.\nRepeat offenders\nOf the properties scheduled for auction, 13 have been flagged for foreclosure multiple times, sometimes reflecting a loan modification or ongoing litigation. Here are the properties that have been to the block before:\nLangdon at Walnut Park, a 277-unit complex at 2101 North Lamar in Austin ($60 million);\nOne Technology Center, a 196,000-square-foot office building, at 7411 John Smith Avenue in San Antonio and Three Forest Drive, a 367,000-square-foot office building, at 12221 Merit Street in Dallas ($57.75 million);\nArioso Apartments &amp; Townhomes, a 288-unit complex at 3030 Claremont Drive in Fort Worth ($56 million).\nMia Riverside, a 312-unit complex at1601 Royal Crest Drive\u00a0 in Austin ($50.2 million); and\nDecorative Center of Houston, a 500,000-square-foot design center at 5120 Woodway Drive ($50 million).\nAviator at Brooks, a 280-unit complex at 8010 Aeromedical Road in San Antonio ($33.9 million);\nGalleria Oaks Building 2, an 18,000-square-foot retail strip at 13376 North U.S. Highway 183 in Austin ($16 million).\nA retail building at 6610 Low Bid Lane home to Soccer Central in San Antonio($10.5 million).\nThe Ascent Apartments, a 154-unit complex at 1150 Babcock Road in San Antonio ($7.5 million);\nLegacy Apartment Homes, a 130-unit complex at 11300 Roszell Street in San Antonio ($6.9 million); and\nA 4.5-acre development site at 3461 McLarry Drive in McKinney ($5.8 million)\nThe Flats at 9338, a 88-unit complex at 9338 Perrin Beitel Road in San Antonio ($4.6 million).\n",

        "content": "The last couple of years have been rough on developer Brian Tuttle.\nIn December 2023, faced with a maturity date on three loans totaling $38.4 million secured by a Royal Palm Beach development site, Tuttle was on the hunt for new lenders to refinance the debt, and new equity partners that could provide capital to break ground on his 38-acre mixed-use project, Mainstreet at Tuttle.\nBut\nTuttle\ngot an icy reception from banks and potential investors. \u201cBanks were saying that due to interest rates, the appraisals had to be reduced significantly,\u201d Tuttle told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cAnd with the appraisals being reduced significantly, you had to put more equity into the deals.\u201d\nWhen he spoke with potential investors, \u201cthey were all looking for a steal,\u201d Tuttle said. \u201cSo when everyone is looking for a below-market deal, the fair market deals just get overlooked. It was very frustrating.\u201d\nIn July 2024, the lender, Fort Lauderdale-based Fuse Group, filed its foreclosure complaint against two Tuttle entities that own the\nRoyal Palm Beach site\n. In an email to his contractors the same month, Tuttle said he had met with more than 200 groups in a 14-month span to put equity into the project, and had no luck. In September, the\nTuttle entities\nfiled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy to stave off a foreclosure auction after Fuse Group won a $47.4 million judgment during the summer.\nTuttle is not alone. A dozen other developers are going through a similar predicament. Across the tri-county region, 13 development sites have landed in bankruptcy court or are in the crosshairs of foreclosure with industry players warning that this is the front edge of a bigger wave. In 2024, five development sites faced foreclosure, according to an analysis by\nTRD.\nSouth Florida\u2019s pandemic boom was supposed to inoculate the region from the commercial real estate reckoning gripping the rest of the country. Instead, rising interest rates, high construction and land costs, and more skittish equity investors are turning stalled projects into distress cases. And a growing list of local developers are experiencing a brutal hangover, faced with a reckoning with lenders that are done \u201cextending and pretending.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s more in the pipeline,\u201d Josh Rubens, a shareholder with Miami law firm Kluger Kaplan, told\nTRD\n. \u201cI think there have been some extensions over the last 12 to 24 months that you will be seeing headlines about in the next six to 12 months, as those maturities hit.\u201d\nLoans due after pandemic boom\nDuring the Covid migration surge, developers raced to lock up sites and launch apartment towers, condo-hotels, offices and mixed-use projects on the assumption that rents and prices would keep climbing, and that floating-rate debt could be refinanced before it reset higher.\nThat script blew up when the Federal Reserve hiked rates, and construction costs jumped by roughly 30 percent in a matter of a few years, according to lenders. Plans that looked like slam dunks in 2021 and 2022 now show thin or negative returns once higher borrowing costs and pricier hard costs are baked in. That makes it far tougher to secure new construction loans or new bridge loans.\n\u201cFlorida, and South Florida for sure, still has demand,\u201d said Brett Forman, whose Fort Lauderdale-based Forman Capital has financed ground-up projects across the state. \u201cBut you had explosive growth brought on by Covid\u2026 and there are developers that may have gotten over their skis, perhaps [got] too aggressive.\u201d\nHe points to a \u201cginormous amount of debt\u201d still coming due through this year and 2026, much of it on land or early stage deals that never made it to full construction financing.\nThe common denominator in many of the distressed sites are short-term bridge loans \u2014 typically 12 to 36 months, sometimes with six-month or 12\u2011month extension options \u2014 that have already run through multiple reprieves. Those loans were supposed to carry a project through entitlements or early predevelopment to a cheaper construction loan or a sale. Instead, developers are stuck in place while interest accrues at double-digit rates.\n\u201cYou rerun the math at a higher interest rate and building costs up 30 percent, and the numbers don\u2019t make sense anymore,\u201d Holly MacDonald\u2011Korth of Coral Gables-based KDM Financial, told\nTRD\n. \u201c[Developers] have a hard time getting a new loan for a deal that, on paper, doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to turn the profit they thought.\u201d\nThat dynamic is playing out at a slew of Miami and Fort Lauderdale development sites.\nForman Capital\nis seeking to foreclose on a planned condo-hotel site in Miami\u2019s Arts &amp; Entertainment District over an alleged default on an $8.3 million bridge loan that matured in August. The lender says it is owed default interest and fees on top of the unpaid principal.\nThe project\u2019s former manager, prolific high-rise developer Dan Kodsi, said he is no longer involved, underscoring how quickly capital stacks can get reshuffled when a bridge lender\u2019s clock runs out. Forman and Joseph Pardo, the attorney for the entity that owns the site, declined to comment about the foreclosure case.\nPrivate lenders putting the squeeze\nMost of the developers for the 13 sites with distressed loans are dealing with private lenders that have run out of patience. In several recent cases, foreclosure suits have escalated into bitter legal battles, with developers filing last-ditch bankruptcy petitions or appeals.\nIn Aventura,\nRok Lending\nended up taking title to a 1.6\u2011acre medical office development site at a foreclosure auction, paying just $477,800 after winning a $19.9 million foreclosure judgment tied to a $15 million loan it issued in 2023. Developer Marlon Gomez repeatedly tried to stall the sale with appeals and bankruptcy filings, all of which were denied. The strategy bought him time, but not a better outcome.\nAnd on the Miami River, a receiver is trying to sell a 1.8\u2011acre site for a project called\nMiami River Cove\nfor $18 million. The planned 40\u2011townhome development, also tied to Gomez, is the subject of a foreclosure suit by a Fiorentino Family Office affiliate that alleges a default on a $10 million loan and claims the borrowing entity used fraudulent documents to secure the debt. Gomez and his partners deny wrongdoing. Gomez did not respond to requests for comment.\nBankruptcy petitions and countersuits against lenders are largely stonewalling tactics by borrowers holding out hope that market conditions for refinancing and capital equity will improve, Forman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of quasi delaying the inevitable,\u201d he said.\nLenders are now pushing back on those tactics. For instance,\nFuse Group\n, the lender in the Mainstreet at Tuttle site in Royal Palm Beach, had asked the bankruptcy court to toss the developer\u2019s Chapter 11 petition, alleging that Tuttle long planned to use Chapter 11 solely to delay the foreclosure process. An evidentiary hearing is scheduled for Jan. 20 to Jan. 22, court records show. Rubens, the lender-side attorney, also represents Fuse Group. He declined to comment about the case.\nMeanwhile, the Tuttle entities have submitted a reorganization plan to the bankruptcy court. \u201cWe filed a Chapter 11 to protect the unsecured creditors so that [Fuse Group] didn\u2019t wipe them out,\u201d Tuttle said. \u201cAnd right now we\u2019re working with the bank and the bankruptcy court to come up with the best plan to try and make it a win as much as possible.\u201d\nEven marquee developments that symbolized Miami\u2019s pandemic-era swagger are starting to fray. At Miami Worldcenter, Monarch Alternative Capital is moving to foreclose on the site of Kodsi\u2019s\nLegacy Hotel &amp; Residences\n, a 50\u2011story condo-hotel where construction has been paused since last year. Monarch now controls a roughly $340 million loan originally made by Silverstein Capital Partners in late 2021, that, according to Kodsi, was only partially funded, court filings show.\nKodsi told a judge this summer that he is working on a roughly $390 million refinancing, but he missed a court ordered deadline to post a\n$32 million\nsurety bond, and faced a November cutoff to pay more than $35 million in principal, unpaid interest and late fees. The case encapsulates the new math: Even highly marketed, partially built towers with strong locations and branding are struggling to refinance large, floating-rate construction loans in today\u2019s environment.\nMore pain in the pipeline\nLender-side attorney Rubens said the biggest problem loans often involve default interest running at 20\u2011plus percent for extended periods. To refinance, borrowers may need fresh equity to bridge the gap between what the new lender will advance and what is owed on the defaulted loan.\n\u201cThere may be a large balance that another lender is apprehensive about getting involved in,\u201d Rubens said. \u201cThese things just take time, and unfortunately, time sometimes really works against the developers when you have a high interest bridge loan that\u2019s ticking away with interest.\u201d\nMacDonald\u2011Korth said that with at least 13 sites already in default, more are inevitable, especially where lenders got \u201ca little aggressive\u201d on proceeds and valuations during the boom.\n\u201cEverybody thought South Florida is exempt from all of these commercial real estate issues,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it turns out, a year or two later, it\u2019s not.\u201d",

        "content": "The\nvelvet-roped corner of University Park\njust added another chart-topping listing.\nA nearly 13,000-square-foot estate in the coveted Volk Estates enclave is back on the market at $35 million, instantly landing among the priciest homes publicly listed in Dallas. The property at 6601 Hunters Glen Road debuted Oct. 31 and is now tied for the region\u2019s second-most expensive public listing with a Highland Park manse on Lexington Avenue, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The asking price is equivalent to $2,701 per square foot.\nOnly the\nCrespi Estate\n\u2014 the perennial heavyweight at $64 million \u2014 sits higher. The listing marks a dramatic jump in asking price from its last sale in 2021, when a trust linked to the late private equity executive Joshua Pack bought the home for $21.5 million.\nPack\n, co-CEO of Fortress Investment Group, died in September at age 51.\nAllie Beth Allman &amp; Associates\u2019 Alex Perry has the listing. Modern updates are credited to the Dallas-based Sebastian Construction Group.\nThe estate spans almost two acres, a rarity even within Volk Estates, long considered one of the area\u2019s most exclusive pockets. Built in 1927, the three-story home blends its original architecture with a suite of recent updates. Inside are five bedrooms, six full bathrooms and three half-baths, plus refreshed living spaces and redesigned suites meant to modernize the nearly century-old footprint without losing its bones.\nOutside, the grounds read like a private club: layered gardens and courtyards, a resurfaced and retiled pool, full tennis court, putting green and reworked patios all in view of a two-story cabana. The private gym has undergone a complete overhaul as well, rounding out the compound-style amenities expected at this echelon of the market.\nDallas Central Appraisal District public records show annual property taxes topping $252,000. The manse is a marker of where luxury valuations continue to push in the Park Cities, even as\nhigher-end listings take longer to trade\nin the broader market.\nVolk Estates homes rarely surface, and when they do, they tend to reset the local pricing curve. With the Pack estate now asking $35 million, the enclave remains a bellwether for\nultra-luxury demand\nin Dallas.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The deal closed in late July, but property records showed the buyer identified as a limited liability company named Brise Lontaine.\nBlavatnik paid $115 million \u2014 $13.5 million per acre \u2014for the eight-and-a-half-acre property, marking the largest deal for a single residential parcel in Hamptons history.\nCombined parcels have sold for a higher price tag, but in terms of a single parcel in the Hamptons, none had surpassed a $105 million deal in Water Mill in 2021. The sale also represented the first nine-figure deal in the Hamptons in almost two years.\nThe billionaire is not new to the area, already owning a smaller home on Further Lane and an oceanfront estate on Dune Road in Bridgehampton.\nThe seller was Terry Semel, the one-time chair of both Yahoo! and Warner Bros. Semel bought the property from Blackstone\u2019s Stephen Schwarzman in 2005 for $43 million. Neighbors on Further Lane include Jerry Seinfeld, Lorne Michaels and Larry Gagosian.\nIn the two decades of Semel\u2019s ownership, the five-bedroom cottage that was the prize of the parcel was converted into a guesthouse, while a modern main house draws the bulk of the attention today; its square footage is unknown and pictures of the residence are difficult to come by.\nThe average sales price in the Hamptons in the third quarter was $3.5 million, according to\nMiller Samuel\n, while the median sale was an even $2 million. Both of those numbers represented the second-highest marks on record, per the report.\nElsewhere, Blavatnik is working with fellow billionaire Vlad Doronin of the OKO Group on\nsecuring approval\nfor changes to the Aman Miami Beach luxury condo and hotel development under construction. The oceanfront project will include a 22-unit Aman-branded condominium in an 18-story building, as well as the 56-key Aman hotel in the historic Versailles structure.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "New York City is poised to get three casinos.\nThe state Gaming Facility Location Board on Monday recommended that the Gaming Commission award casino licenses to the three remaining proposals in Queens and the Bronx.\nThe proposals include Steve Cohen\u2019s Metropolitan Park, an $8 billion facility planned near Citi Field; the proposed $4 billion complex at Bally\u2019s Golf Links at Ferry Point; and Resorts World\u2019s $7.5 billion expansion of the Queens Aqueduct.\nThe board assessed the proposals based on four different\ncategories\n, giving the most weight to \u201ceconomic activity and business development,\u201d which included various factors, including total planned investment, jobs potentially created and each team\u2019s ability to finance the project.\nThe proposals now go to the commission, which is expected to issue the licenses by the end of December.\nThe commission will not second-guess the assessment of the board, but will make sure the casino proposals meet\nstatutory requirements\n, many of which were part of the board\u2019s review, a spokesperson for the commission told\nTRD\nin October.\nThe three winners were the only remaining competitors in the years-long race for one of three state licenses up for grabs.\nThe board\u2019s announcement comes after Community Advisory Committees eliminated four teams from the competition, including\nevery\nManhattan proposal. In a surprise move last month, MGM Resorts\ndropped\nits bid to turn its Yonkers facility into a full-blown casino. At the time, the company blamed the decision on \u201ca newly defined competitive landscape,\u201d pointing to the fact that the remaining proposals were clustered in a \u201csmall geographic area.\u201d\nMGM also wanted an initial 30-year license, but based on rules issued by the state in October, the company\u2019s Yonkers proposals would only qualify for 15 years.\nUnder the rules, in order to qualify for 30 years, an applicant would need to invest at least $10 billion. Resorts World pegs its investment at $7.5 billion, and Cohen estimates $8 billion for Metropolitan Park, which would mean a 20-year license for each. The projected investment at Bally\u2019s is $4 billion, which means it qualifies for a 15-year license.\nPlans for Metropolitan Park would turn 50 acres worth of parking lots next to Citi Field into a casino complex with a Hard Rock hotel, a 5,650-person live music venue, restaurants and 25 acres of green space. As part of their casino bid, Cohen and Hark Rock International have also\nteamed up\nwith Slate Property Group to build 450 affordable housing units at 54-19 100th Street in Corona, roughly two miles from the planned casino.\nThe Bally\u2019s casino would be built on 16 acres of parking lots and practice green area at Bally\u2019s Golf Links at Ferry Point. The project would include 500 hotel rooms and a 2,000-seat entertainment venue.\nThe planned expansion of the Queens Aqueduct would add gaming space (6,000 slot machines and 800 table games), as well as 2,000 hotel rooms and a 7,000-seat arena. Resorts World has also agreed, through an agreement with\nCirrus Real Estate\n, to invest in 50,000 workforce housing units citywide.\nIn the lead-up to Monday\u2019s announcement, Gaming Commission Chair Brian O\u2019Dwyer has emphasized that the state could issue up to three licenses and could opt to award fewer. During a September meeting, he called the competition a \u201ctabula rasa.\u201d\nStill, Resorts World, and MGM before it dropped out, appeared to have a leg up in the contest, given that they were already operating as slot parlors.\n",

The total was down from 29 contracts signed in the\nprevious period\n, but it beat the decade norm of 17 pending deals logged during the holiday week.\nA sponsor unit at\n53 West 53rd Street\n, asking $23 million, was the priciest to snag a signed contract in the holiday week. The condo spans 3,700 square feet and has three bedrooms and three bathrooms and features views of Central Park.\nSales at the tower, developed by Pontiac Land Group and Hines, launched in 2015 and are now led by a team with Douglas Elliman\u2019s development marketing arm, including Renee Micheli, Jade Chan, Frances Katzen and Michelle Griffith.\nOther units at the building, known as the Museum of Modern Art tower, have also snagged top contracts, including in October, when a full-floor apartment found a buyer\nafter asking just under $47 million\n. The developers initially sought $51 million for the condo.\nAmenities at the 81-story building, completed in 2020, include a lap pool, fitness center, golf simulator and concierge.\nThe second most expensive home to find a buyer was a Greenwich Village townhouse asking just under $20 million. The five-story property at 152 West 13th Street, which hit the market in September, last traded in 2016 for $15 million, following a two-year renovation.\nThe 5,600-square-foot home has four bedrooms, four bathrooms and an elevator. It also features double-height ceilings in the great room, a landscaped garden and finished cellar.\nCompass\u2019 Aeen Avini and Lauren Pepin had the listing.\nLast year, another townhouse in Greenwich Village\nset a new record\nfor Downtown Manhattan when it sold in an off-market deal for $73 million. The double-wide home at 138-140 West 11th Street paved the way for another megamansion in the neighborhood to hit the market earlier this year, asking\n$75 million\n.\nOf the 19 properties, eight were condos, seven were co-ops and four were townhouses.\nThe homes asked a combined $189 million, which works out to an average price of $10 million and a median of $8 million. The typical home was on the market for more than two years and had a discount of 16 percent.\n",

New York-based Seritage Growth Properties, led by interim CEO Adam Metz, sold the property for $131 million, a source confirmed.

In addition to Aventura Mall, Turnberry owns Town Center Aventura. The firm is also a partner in the SoL\u00e9 Mia mixed-use community in North Miami and is co-developing an 800-key hotel connected to the Miami Beach Convention Center.\nSimon, a global retail real estate investment trust, primarily owns malls and mixed-use centers across North America, Europe and Asia. \u200b\nSeritage\n, which had battled construction liens, tenant litigation and pandemic-related delays at Esplanade before stabilizing leasing, has been in the process of selling down its holdings as part of a shareholder-approved liquidation strategy.\nIn June, Seritage sold a shuttered Sears store at Town Center at Boca Raton to Simon for\n$23 million\n.",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s housing market is shrugging off a national cooldown, chalking up the strongest price gains among the country\u2019s largest metros and widening the divide between the region and Sun Belt markets now slipping into reverse.\nOctober brought the sharpest monthly jump of the year, further cementing Chicago as one of the nation\u2019s outliers, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. According to\nIllinois Realtors\n, the median sales price in the nine-county metro area hit $369,000 in October, up 8.5 percent from a year earlier. In the city, the median reached $370,000, up 7.2 percent. Nationally, prices rose just 2.1 percent that month, making Chicago\u2019s growth more than quadruple the pace of the U.S. overall.\nThe numbers reinforce a year-long stretch in which Chicago has consistently ranked near the top of major metro price charts. September data from the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index showed Chicago leading all 20 tracked metros with a 5.45 percent annual price growth.\nNew York, long the only big-city competitor rising faster, slipped to 5.25 percent. Eleven of the 20 metros posted price declines, highlighting what S&amp;P\u2019s Nicholas Godec called an accelerating deceleration nationwide.\nMany of the worst performers \u2014 Tampa, Phoenix, Dallas \u2014 are markets where pandemic-era run-ups are now unwinding, compounded in Florida by an\ninsurance crisis\ndragging on values. Chicago\u2019s slower, steadier appreciation during those frenzy years left it less exposed, and now it\u2019s a relative safe harbor. Price growth is cooling slightly from earlier Case-Shiller reports, but still handily outpacing inflation.\nSales, meanwhile, remain muted but stable. The city logged 1,782 closings in October, down 2.2 percent year-over-year, while the metro posted a 2 percent increase to 7,690. Year-to-date sales are up marginally \u2014 0.5 percent in the city and 1.3 percent metro-wide \u2014 putting the region on track to finish slightly better than 2024, which marked the slowest sales year since 2011.\nUnlike the overstocked conditions in much of the country, Chicago\u2019s inventory is still tight enough to keep prices rising but not so thin that buyers are boxed out. A Redfin analysis found local buyers outnumbered sellers by 2.7 percent in October, making\nChicago\none of just eight balanced markets among the nation\u2019s 50 largest. The gap is much larger nationwide, with available properties outnumbering buyers by about 37 percent.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Jenn Gilson of Golden Gate Sotheby\u2019s International Realty holds the listing for the gated compound at 3000 Ralston Avenue.\nThe mansion sits on a 12.3-acre property and has garnered acclaim for its design inside and out. The home was envisioned by Architectural Digest 100 architect Andrew Skurman and Architectural Digest 100 designer Suzanne Tucker, and once received the California Landscape Contractors Association\u2019s Grand Sweepstakes Award for best residential real estate completed in California.\nThe design itself was inspired by\nItaly\u2019s famed Lake Como\n, at Kruttschnitt\u2019s request.\n\u201cWe visited Lake Como several times, and it was always special to us,\u201d Kruttschnitt told Mansion Global. The estate came together when the couple bought three adjacent properties in 2006, combined them into one and demolished the old homes on the parcels to build a grand new mansion.\nThe couple hired 110 subcontractors, including some from Europe, to complete the home over six years.The 12,404-square-foot house, finished in 2013, was designed to host large-scale events, with Kruttschnitt noting a recent black-tie event on the front lawn with 450 guests as an example. The 82-year-old philanthropist and his wife are offloading the property as he and his wife spend more time at their home in\nPalm Desert\n.\nThe home includes six bedrooms, seven full bathrooms and 10 half baths as well as a 4,612-square-foot guest house with one bedroom and an office. The main house boasts a fitness center, a theater, a game room, a spa and a 2,100-gallon saltwater aquarium with tropical fish. Outside, there is a swimming pool, an 150-seat amphitheater, an event lawn, a two-story sports pavilion, courts for tennis, pickleball, volleyball, badminton, horseshoe, shuffleboard, and bocce ball, as well as a truncated golf course and a putting green.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The deal includes only the multifamily portion of the building \u2014 a 400-room Loews hotel occupies the rest of the building.\nThe sale is the priciest multifamily deal in the city this year, surpassing a Fulton Market apartment complex that sold\nfor $170 million in April\n. The Streeterville sale price, which came out to about $439,000 per unit, is slightly higher than the $173 million\nCrescent Heights paid\nfor the tower in 2023.\nBut the trade is still well below the $240.31 million that the previous owner, Invesco, paid for the property in 2016.\nCrescent Heights secured a $112 million Freddie Mac loan on the building in 2023 at an interest rate of 5.45 percent, maturing in July 2028, and it was assumable by a buyer. That was likely a selling point for FPA, offering relief from higher interest rates in today\u2019s market.\nWhen the building hit the market earlier this year, the property was listed as 93 percent occupied with average rents of $3,574 per unit. Newmark brokers Liz Gagliardi, Chuck Johanns and Susan Lawson represented Crescent Heights on the listing.\nNeither FPA nor Crescent Heights immediately responded to a request for comment.\nFor FPA, the acquisition is the latest in a buying spree across the Chicago area. The San Francisco-based firm bought a Naperville apartment complex in March for $68 million, a month after it\nsold a Downers Grove building\nto Laramar Group. FPA also purchased a 500-unit South Loop building in March 2024 for\n$144 million\n, following that up with a $60 million Oak Park tower\nin July 2024\nand another\nOak Park acquisition\nin August of that year.\nThe deal comes amid a busy multifamily market in Chicago, as landlords are looking to cash in on strong rent growth and a limited development pipeline. The North Water Street property was one of several\nmajor multifamily offerings\nto hit the market this year, including others in Streeterville like a 263-unit tower listed by Green Cities and The Streeter, a 481-unit building owned by the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio.\nElsewhere, Crescent Heights is planning a 52-story complex at 420 North May Street in Fulton Market. The firm bought the site for $34.5 million in 2023. In the Gold Coast, Crescent Heights is planning a\ncondo-to-rental conversion\nat 850 North Lake Shore Drive, which it bought at a discount for $80 million in 2024.\nNot all its developments have panned out: Crescent Heights\nsurrendered a South Loop development site\nthrough a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure where it had planned to build a tower up to 900 feet next to its existing 76-story Nema Chicago. The 43,000-square-foot vacant lot was handed over to lender Grupo Financiero Inbursa in May 2024 after the firm unsuccessfully sought a buyer for the property.\n",

After failing to sell for $17.9 million last year, the home listed for $15.9 million this spring \u2014 earning a spot among the top 10 most expensive new listings in Texas in April, according to the Houston Association of Realtors.\nThe sale price was not disclosed.\nThe Tudor-style estate is on a 2-acre lot with its own subdivision, Polka Park, in Preston Hollow. Steven Ross, the Grand Prairie plastics titan who founded the parent company of Husky, platted the subdivision in 2007 and conveyed the property in 2008 to his daughter, Rachel Polka, the seller.\nConstruction and marketing have also been a family affair. Homebuilder Barry Buford built the home in 2007, and his wife Lucinda, an agent at Allie Beth Allman and Associates, had the listing.\nAlong with the six-bedroom, 18,000-square-foot home, the property includes a pool, a tennis court, a batting cage and an indoor basketball court.\nIn addition to Centurion American\u2019s\nprolific single-family community operations\n, Moayedi also develops luxury homes in Dallas. His custom luxury company, Crescent Estates Custom Homes, is filling the Turtle Creek condo\nResidences at Routh\nthis year. Crescent is also selling the\nCrespi Estates\n, a development of single-family spec mansions\nparceled\nfrom the landmark\nCrespi Estate manor\nin Preston Hollow.\nMoayedi plans to remodel the Strait Lane property rather than redevelop it, according to a company spokesperson.\nIt\u2019s common to see listings boast of being on the most prestigious street in town, but Strait Lane has a fair claim to the title.\nRoss Perot Sr. lived there\n, and billionaire\nToby Neugebauer\n, S2 Capital founder\nScott Everett\nand Panda Biotech CEO\nBob Carter\nstill do.\n",

Tenants inked deals for 2.99 million square feet, down about 12 percent year over year, according to a new Colliers report. Still, demand exceeded the borough\u2019s 10-year monthly average and pushed year-to-date activity to 36.7 million square feet, already ahead of last year\u2019s total.\nIf December holds pace, Manhattan could top 40 million square feet of leasing for the first time since 2019.\nA handful of headline-grabbing deals anchored the month, led by Millennium Management\u2019s 438,000-square-foot renewal at BXP\u2019s\n399 Park Avenue\n. That was followed by Rippling\u2019s 133,000-square-foot deal at Vornado\u2019s 330 West 34th Street and two 125,000-plus-square-foot leases at Vornado\u2019s\nPenn 2 by Robinhood\nand Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods.\nEven with the slowdown, availability dipped to 14.2 percent, its lowest level since late 2020, per Colliers. Net absorption remained positive at just over half a million square feet, while sublet supply continued its long unwind, falling for the 14th straight month to 11.8 million square feet, now below pre-pandemic levels.\nMidtown led the borough with 1.4 million square feet leased, though volume slipped 9 percent from October and nearly 30 percent year over year. Availability in the submarket fell slightly to 12.8 percent from 13 percent, helped by a lack of new space coming on the market and falling sublet inventory. Average asking rents to $82.29 per square foot, about 4 percent lower than March 2020.\nMidtown South recorded 1.23 million square feet of leasing, driven by tech and retail tenants. Downtown leasing tumbled to 356,000 square feet, half of October\u2019s total, but more than double what it was last year, per Colliers. Availability ticked up to 17.6 percent as demand dropped and 205,000 square feet of sublet space hit the market at 1 New York Plaza.\n",

        "content": "Transit-oriented development\nis driving multifamily projects in Los Angeles.\nDevelopers are increasingly chasing density bonuses near rail stations in the hope that renters will flock to the new residences for walkability and transit convenience, L.A. Business First\nreported\n. The financial reprieves from\npermitted upzoning\nthrough Los Angeles\u2019 Transit-Oriented Communities Incentive Program have attracted developers looking to get shovels in the dirt faster.\nThe program has \u201csupercharged housing production\u201d across the city, Martin Leitner, a principal at Nadel Architects, told L.A. Business First. At the end of 2024,\nL.A. Metro\nfound that more than 110 projects were in development through the Transit-Oriented Communities program; that included more than 11,000 affordable and market-rate housing units. L.A. Metro has helped contribute to construction by aiding in the development of 5,000 units near its stations across Los Angeles County and aiming for 10,000 units by 2031.\nIntroduced in 2016, Los Angeles\u2019 Transit-Oriented Communities program gives developers\ntax incentives\nto build residences within a half-mile of a major transit stop. Developers must designate some housing as affordable units in order to qualify. Incentives are structured in tiers based on proximity to transit stations and the type of transit service offered.\nBuilders are trying to \u201cfollow the money,\u201d according to KWP Real Estate agent Lee Shapiro. \u201cDevelopers are looking at what can be financed and what can be built based on the cost of the land,\u201d Shapiro said. In a market facing high rates and shifting land values, Transit-Oriented Development could prove especially attractive if interest rates ease in the coming months.\u201d\n\u201cWe do see a lot of developers come out of the woodwork and start taking some risk on development, and that is [the] growth of multifamily,\u201d Shapiro added. \u201cOften offices will come along with that. Right now, there\u2019s a lot of available office space in Los Angeles, but typically I would anticipate we\u2019d see the trend of increased rental rates and new growth and development.\u201d\nA building boom could be on the horizon if economic headwinds begin to clear. As it stands, developers still face high construction costs, tariffs, economic uncertainty and high interest rates, presenting sometimes insurmountable hurdles for builders looking to get to work at the transit stop-proximal sites.\n\u201cWith a lot of capital still on the sidelines because the market\u2019s tough and projects are penciling, those [transit-oriented development] projects in good, destination-rich, transit-oriented locations are going to be the first to come off the sidelines,\u201d Leitner said, noting that it\u2019s already happening.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

That\u2019s about 1,400 more homes than September and 7,000 more homes than last October, putting it in first place for year-over-year home inventory growth, according to Homes.com senior director of market analytics Itziar Aguirre.\nTexas marked second as well as first place. Dallas/Fort Worth has the second-biggest housing inventory in the country, according to Homes.com. However, unlike other Texas metros, Houston continues to heap homes onto the shelves, even in the face of a\nbuyer\u2019s market shift\nthat has\nmany sellers leaving the market.\nHouston is the only metro in the Texas Triangle to see inventory increase in the past few months, according to CoStar. Homeowners around the country are increasingly deciding to take their homes off the market and wait for better conditions; in Houston, though, a boom in\nmaster-planned community projects\nappears to be countering the resale market\u2019s decline.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still seeing a lot of\nmaster-planned communities\npop up, even today at this interest rate, so that\u2019s keeping inventory high. Especially west and north of Houston,\u201d Aguirre said.\nMonth-over-month, housing inventory has shrunk in Dallas since July. The Austin housing market has also contracted, dipping from 16,500 homes for sale in July to 14,700 in October. San Antonio has slowed as well, though its inventory ticked up in September before decreasing again in October.\nAll the while, the number of homes for sale in Houston has increased, month-over-month.\nHouston was already crowned king of master-planned communities in January after year-end data showed that\na plurality of the 50 best-selling master-planned communities in 2024 were in the Bayou City\n. The pipeline has remained full all year with projects by\nStarwood Land\n,\nBrookfield\n,\nHines\n,\nFriendswood Development Company and D.R. Horton\ntaking shape. Over a fifth of all master-planned community sales in the country take place in Houston.\nWhile single-family home inventory grew 16 percent, year-over-year in October, townhomes and condos grew by 27 and 28 percent, respectively.\nKaty and Lake Conroe saw the highest increase in active listings in the region, year-over-year.\n",

The 360-unit project is being developed at 701 Newark Avenue in the city\u2019s Journal Square neighborhood.\nGoldman Sachs provided the financing for the 34-story development through its Urban Investment Group. The financing takes the shape of a construction loan, bridge facility, low-income housing tax credit equity and other public capital.\nA JLL team including Jimmy Cochran, Nicco Lupo and Jillian Grzywacz advised on the financing deal. The developer previously scored a $90 million tax credit award through the state\u2019s Aspire program.\nBreaking ground this week, Homestead Gateway will include 270 market-rate units and 90 affordable housing units on the former site of a municipal parking lot, according to\nMulti-Housing News\n.\nAmenities will include a rooftop lounge, fitness center, bicycle storage and workspaces. There will also be 3,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space in the building, which is being designed by C3D Architecture.\n\u201cWe are very proud to be building this project, which brings both market rate and affordable housing, provides hundreds of union jobs and completes Homestead Place, a pedestrian walkway that will give easy Manhattan access to thousands of PATH train commuters,\u201d Lions Group NYC\u2019s Aaron Shirian told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nWhile cheaper than its Manhattan neighbor, Jersey City is emerging as one of the nation\u2019s most expensive rental markets. Last month, the average rent was $3,152, according to Apartments.com, 93 percent higher than the national average.

In 2023, just\nseven luxury contracts were signed\nduring the holiday week.\nThe median asking price for homes that entered contract was $2.8 million and homes spent an average of 102 days on the market.\nThe top deal signed last week went to a townhouse at 229 Dean Street in Boerum Hill, asking $5.75 million.\nWachtell partner Gregory Pessin bought the home for $4.45 million in 2016 and undertook a complete renovation of the 21-foot-wide two-family. The home was originally asking $6 million in September before a price drop at the start of November.\nThe top-floor primary suite has a sitting area,\u00a0 dressing room and a primary bathroom with radiant heated floors and a walk-in shower. The home has three outdoor spaces including a private rooftop terrace and a back garden terrace that is connected to the parlor-floor living room through a floor-to-ceiling glass wall.\nA one-bedroom unit with its own entrance and an in-unit washer and dryer takes up the garden floor.\nCompass\u2019 Rachel Greenstein, Suzanne Koxvold and Toni Nicolo had the listing.\nThe second priciest contract last week belonged to a Park Slope townhouse at 294 Garfield Place, asking just under $4 million.\nThe deal for the two-family home occurred off-market.\nBuilt in 1901, the home spans over 4,200 square feet and comes with six bedrooms and four bathrooms.\nThe home maintains much of its original details, including stained glass windows, decorative plaster moldings, paneled wainscoting and inlaid hardwood floors. Two second-floor grand bedrooms are connected by an original adjoining wash basin.\nThe garden level has a one-bedroom unit with direct access to the rear yard.\nCompass\u2019 Scott Klein had the listing.\n",

The deal breaks down to $267 per square foot.\nDavie-based Arnet paid $37.2 million above the previous sale price 11 years ago. Arnet occupies half of the fully leased complex, known as Westport Business Park, under a lease agreement that expires in 2035, according to an online listing.\nPrologis\npaid $15.9 million for the 12.3-acre site in 1990, records show. The warehouses were completed in 1990.\nArnet manufactures vitamins, minerals, amino acids and herbal supplements, according to the company\u2019s website.\nPrologis is among South Florida\u2019s largest institutional owners of industrial properties. In January, the firm sold a 3.4-acre industrial site near Miami International Airport to Miami-Dade County for\n$17 million\n.\nAs part of that transaction, Prologis agreed to demolish four one- and two-story warehouses on the property, which Miami-Dade plans to use for parking and as a construction staging area for other airport projects.\nLast year, Prologis dropped $112 million for two other industrial properties near Miami International Airport. The firm paid\n$57 million\nfor a 157,200-square-foot facility in Doral, and acquired the former TracFone Wireless headquarters near Doral for\n$55 million\n. Prologis plans on redeveloping the existing office building into warehouses.\nMiami-Dade\u2019s industrial market has softened the past year. The vacancy rate jumped to 5.5 percent in the third quarter compared with 4.6 percent during the same period last year, according to Colliers. The average asking rent grew slightly to $16.65 per square foot in the third quarter compared to $16.43 in the same period last year.",

        "content": "Chicago buyers can\u2019t seem to catch a break, be they entry-level shoppers, mid-tier movers or even the deep-pocketed crowd.\nHome prices across all three slices of the metro\u2019s for-sale market rose faster in October than in most of the nation\u2019s major metros, tightening affordability even as many warm weather markets saw relief, according to data by First American Data &amp; Analytics, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nPrices at the bottom and top of Chicago\u2019s market \u2014 what First American tags as starter homes and\nluxury properties\n\u2014 were each up 6.5 percent, year-over-year. Mid-tier homes weren\u2019t far behind at 5.5 percent. That level of\nacross-the-board escalation\noutpaced more than 10 other major metros, and contrasted sharply with places where prices have slipped in all tiers.\nChicago trailed only New York at the high end, where upper-tier prices spiked nearly 15 percent.\nOdeta Kushi, First American\u2019s deputy chief economist, pointed to the Chicago region\u2019s long-running relative affordability as a key reason Chicago is still seeing\nprice strength\n, despite stiff headwinds. Elevated mortgage rates, revived return-to-office policies and general economic anxiety have cooled activity nationally. Yet Chicago, which held onto its affordability edge better than any major city over the past 50 years, still gives buyers room to stretch \u2014 even after the pandemic boom pushed local prices sharply higher.\nThe buoyancy is good news for sellers, but not for households trying to break into the market. The fastest pace of growth in Chicago\u2019s entry-level tier suggests that demand hasn\u2019t eased for homes at about $275,000 and below, based on Midwest Real Estate Data figures. Inflation has already strained budgets for moderate-income buyers, and another mid-single-digit jump in prices only tightens the vise.\nChicago\u2019s upper tier is also having a banner year. While New York\u2019s surge is driven by a jump in $5 million-plus condo and co-op deals \u2014 90 contracts in October, according to Corcoran \u2014 Chicago is charting its own\nluxury rally\n. Three homes sold for $9 million or more in October, and sales at $4 million and up set a full year record before Thanksgiving, now on track to hit roughly 150 deals.\nKushi said several big metros, including Chicago, Washington, D.C. and Atlanta, are showing \u201ctop-led\u201d markets this year. But Chicago stands out for seeing price pressure from both ends.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The development team overseeing the Stockyards\u2019 splashiest recent bets is gearing up for another. Majestic Realty, co-developer of Mule Alley and the Hotel Drover, is sketching out a significant redo of the century-old Stockyards Hotel, a property that has long traded on its Old West lore but hasn\u2019t seen a full refresh in decades.\nThe first hints surfaced last year, when Fort Worth Heritage Development \u2014 Majestic\u2019s partnership with the Hickman family \u2014 filed plans for a $20 million renovation of the 50-key hotel at 109 East Exchange Avenue, a gateway spot near the district\u2019s western entrance, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. New filings in mid-November offer a closer look, according to Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation records. Majestic\nsubmitted permits\nto remodel the building and add new outdoor structures, including a 990-square-foot rear canopy, and a 1,344-square-foot front canopy that would help reposition the hotel\u2019s street presence.\nAnother filing with TDLR pegs the canopy work and deck replacement at about $1.5 million. A separate $1.6 million permit covers upgrades to H3 Ranch and\nBooger Red\u2019s Saloon\n\u2014 the hotel\u2019s wood-smoked anchor and its adjoining bar \u2014 with new kitchen equipment, lighting and mechanical systems on deck. The filings list Dallas-based Nunzio Marc DeSantis Architects, a hospitality specialist with a long resume in luxury design, as the architect of record. Work is tentatively slated to begin in January 2026.\nMajestic confirmed the filings, but cautioned that the project isn\u2019t locked in. Rick Kline, who oversees Stockyards operations for the firm, said the company remains \u201cearly in the planning process\u201d and declined to elaborate on scope or timeline.\nThe property\u2019s bones are historic, if not pristine. Built in 1907, the Stockyards Hotel has hosted outlaws, crooners and cattle barons, and today advertises 42 rooms and 10 suites priced from about $129 a night to $649 a night. Its last major overhaul came in the early 1980s, when local businessmen reopened it after a top-to-bottom renovation.\nThe latest effort comes as Majestic navigates\nleadership shake-ups\nand a legal battle with former executive\nCraig Cavileer\n, whose ownership stakes across several Stockyards properties were auctioned in May. The firm has said the district pulls roughly 9 million visitors a year, but its broader 300,000-square-foot expansion plan remains unresolved, in part because an economic development deal with the city has yet to be finalized.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The financing is split between $193 million for the Crossgates Mall in Guilderland and $13.8 million for the Crossgates Commons shopping center in Albany.\nBoth of the deals take the form of five-year finance loans. The developer said in a release announcing the deal that the financing \u201cenables Pyramid to reinvest in the properties, ensuring their vitality, vibrancy and sustained success in the market.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not clear who the lender is for the properties and if it\u2019s the same lender for each of them. Each retail complex, however, has endured challenges in recent years.\nIn August 2023, an unidentified lender\npurchased $243 million in mortgage debt\nbacked by the Crossgates Mall at auction. The debt was sold at a big discount and bondholders lost $100 million in the deal, according to Trepp.\nThe debt had been downgraded in March of that year, two months before the Syracuse-based developer defaulted on three mortgages tied to the mall.\nAnchors at the mall include Macy\u2019s, JCPenney, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Primark and Best Buy. REI and Crunch Fitness are among the recent additions and Ashley Furniture is scheduled to open an outpost next year; the property is 90 percent occupied, according to Pyramid chief executive officer Stephen Congel.\nMeanwhile, New York City-based real estate lender Argentic provided a 10-year loan to\nrefinance\nthe Crossgates Commons debt in 2022.\nIn the last year, Pyramid lost the Aviation Mall in Queensbury, New York, and the Hampshire Mall in \u200b\u200bHadley, Massachusetts, to foreclosure.

        "content": "Lone Star Funds is circling one of San Francisco\u2019s most conspicuous office casualties \u2014 a 20-story tower once scooped up by WeWork at the peak of its expansion binge.\nThe Dallas-based private equity firm is in advanced talks to acquire 600 California Street, positioning Lone Star to extend its distressed-office shopping spree to the Bay Area, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. Pricing details remain under wraps, and the deal hasn\u2019t closed, however Lone Star\u2019s interest tracks with its latest\n$2.7 billion opportunistic fund\n, raised in late 2024 to target commercial properties under lender pressure.\nWith about $95 billion under management, the firm has been blunt about its strategy. Lone Star recently bought a major downtown Denver tower for $132.5 million, and teamed with Miami partners on Fort Lauderdale\u2019s\nBank of America Plaza\nfor $221 million.\n\u201cMost transactions we see and expect are from the banks facing pressure to de-lever their books,\u201d Jerome Foulon, Lone Star\u2019s global head of commercial real estate, told Private Equity Real Estate when the fund closed. \u201cA lot of investors have recognized this is a\nLone Star\nkind of market.\u201d\nFew assets fit that bill better than 600 California. A WeWork and Rhone Advisors venture bought the 359,880-square-foot tower in 2019 for about $323 million \u2014 that\u2019s just under $900 per square foot \u2014 betting on a model that paired\nWeWork\u2019s\nleases with ownership of its buildings. Then the pandemic gutted office demand and slashed valuations.\nBy spring 2023, the venture had defaulted on its $240 million loan. Lenders sued, seeking a receiver and judicial foreclosure; WeWork\u2019s bankruptcy filing followed later that year.\nA court appointed Trigild as receiver in November 2023, and lenders paused foreclosure while testing the market. Trigild hired Newmark to market the property in September of this year. The appraised value has plunged to roughly $109 million, less than a third of its 2019 price, according to CMBS data.\nWeWork, which once occupied more than half the tower, eventually opted to keep its lease, but slimmed its space to about 43,000 square feet under renegotiated terms.\nDistressed inventory remains deep in San Francisco, and 600 California exemplifies it. In August, JLL, which handles leasing at 600 California, was advertising more than 270,000 square feet in the building for lease, meaning the building is roughly 75 percent vacant.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "An apartment complex in\nWalnut Creek\ncould be razed to make way for a fully affordable housing project.\nSatellite Affordable Housing Associates is looking to build an 87-unit, 100 percent affordable development at 150-170 Sierra Drive, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The Berkeley-based developer would have to demolish the existing 29-unit apartment complex that the firm owns on the 1.4-acre lot.\nThe project is currently being reviewed by the City of Walnut Creek under California\u2019s Housing Accountability Act and the State Density Bonus Law. Of the 87 units, at least half will be two- and three-bedroom apartments. Satellite Affordable aims to receive concessions to reduce required parking to 62 spaces from 132 and requested concessions to increase the height limit and interior setbacks. If completed, Sierra Garden Apartments would comprise a six-story building with ground-floor community space, laundry rooms, an outdoor garden, a patio and a pool.\nSatellite Affordable previously turned the 29-unit building on the site into a mixed-income complex. The parcel is in a prime location for redevelopment, having been identified as a possible building site for more housing in the city\u2019s housing element.\nWhile new state laws governing things like environmental review and density bonuses have cleared some development obstacles and made the approval process quicker, developers are still facing challenges from national issues. Namely, those pursuing multifamily and single-family projects have to contend with high construction costs, tariffs, economic uncertainty and high interest rates. In order to fund Sierra Garden Apartments, Satellite Affordable plans\nto use both private and public funding including low-income tax credits.\nUnder Walnut Creek\u2019s housing element, the city must plan for 5,805 new units by 2031, with 3,501 of those being affordable, Contra Costa News\nreported\n. It remains unclear when final review for Sierra Garden Apartments will kick off or when construction could begin.\nElsewhere in Walnut Creek, last month, Concord-based DeNova Homes submitted paperwork to build a 112-unit, five-story apartment building\non the site of Putter\u2019s Miniature Golf\nat 1271-1275 South California Boulevard. In September, local property owner Steve Depper filed an application to build a six-story, 74-unit apartment building on the site of\nDutch Girls Cleaners\nat 2094 Mount Diablo Boulevard.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",
