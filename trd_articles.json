        "content": "Two decades ago, the\nFallon Company\ndeveloped a 20-unit condominium on Sackett Street in Brooklyn. Since then the Boston-based builder has finished more than $5 billion worth of projects, but not a single one in New York City.\nIt\u2019s not because CEO Michael Fallon, whose father\nJoseph Fallon\nfounded the company in 1993, has anything against New York City.\n\u201cNew York is such a fabulous place,\u201d he said, describing it as the social, cultural and business mecca of the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s such a deep pool of opportunity.\u201d\nYet Fallon sees greener pastures for his firm in the Southeast, in particular Nashville and Charlotte, as well as his home market of Boston.\n\u201cWhy are we focused on the markets we\u2019re focused on? Scale and access to capital,\u201d the 36-year-old said in a Zoom interview with\nThe Real Deal\n.\nFallon likes building in Nashville and Charlotte because of their good infrastructure, financial health, amenable stakeholders, business-friendly political climates and nice weather. Also, both have a National Football League franchise.\nMost of Fallon\u2019s $6 billion pipeline is in the Southeast. There, he doesn\u2019t have to worry that locals will elect political leaders eager to \u201cdecommoditize\u201d housing \u2014 a concept that popped up as Fallon researched\nZohran Mamdani\nin preparation for his\nTRD\ninterview.\nIn one campaign video, Mamdani says, \u201cIf we want to end the housing crisis, the solution has to be moving toward the\nfull de-commodification of housing\n.\u201d\nTo the contrary, the only feasible strategy to end \u2014 or prevent \u2014 a housing crisis is to allow for-profit development at scale.\nFallon does that by building affordable units the traditional way, typically with Low Income Housing Tax Credits, partnerships with big insurers such as Mass Mutual and Prudential, and debt from major lenders including\nFortress Investment Group\n; Santander,\nBank OZK\n, Wells Fargo and Key Bank.\nThe first phase of his next\nNashville project\nwill be 100 percent affordable and have north of 300 units. In the second phase, 10 percent of the units will be income-restricted. The\n$3 billion project\n, of which Fallon is the master developer, is expected to break ground next year.\n\nFallon is also working with\nCharlotte\u2019s housing authority\non a mixed-use project with 975 residential units, 405,000 square feet of office, 36,000 square feet of retail and amenities, and a 180-key hotel. Phase one includes 329 units, 20 percent of which will be affordable.\nTo be sure, the Fallon Company\u2019s last New York project was long before the socialist Mamdani came along. It has steered clear because like most developers, it prefers to operate in markets where it knows the players and the regulatory, cultural and political environment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about de-risking that whole spectrum of development as much as you can,\u201d the CEO said. \u201cIn New York, it\u2019s very complex and challenging to build.\u201d\nHis company has been in Charlotte since 2016, Raleigh since 2018 and Nashville since 2019.\n\u201cNashville in particular is very focused on \u2018how do we make this a compelling investment opportunity for a company relocation?\u2019\u201d Fallon said. \u201cYou need the city to remove friction points, and that is what the city and state are really good at.\u201d\nTennessee\u2019s capital city is pursuing smart growth and striving to be competitive with other Southeast markets in attracting development, the CEO said.\nNew York has become more\nhospitable\nto new housing since the city\u2019s vacancy rate was found to have sunk to a\nrecord low of 1.4 percent\nin 2023, but it still requires\nhigh wages\nand\nsubstantial affordability\nin large multifamily projects. The hotel workers union has effectively\nblocked nonunion hotels\n. Rezoning remains a\ncrapshoot\n, and\nhistoric districts\nand\nlocal opposition\nare major obstacles.\nDoing a big project in New York would mean navigating these pitfalls and competing with firms familiar with the ins and outs of the city; Fallon cited the Related Companies\u2019\nHudson Yards\nand Tishman Speyer\u2019s\nthe Spiral\nas among his favorite developments. He would also have to find investors to bet on that proposition.\n\u201cWe need to focus on markets where we have a competitive edge in product, in relationships, in policy,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cThat works for partners with very long-term capital.\u201d\n",

The lot is more than 20,000 square feet sitting behind gates with hedges for further privacy. Built in 1925, the New England traditional-style home recently received some touch-ups that included oak floors and interior paint.\nAside from the main residence, there\u2019s a two-story guest house with a bedroom, kitchenette and two bathrooms. Outdoors has a pool and sprawling lawns.\nThe next priciest listing to go into contract last week was 1760 Carla Ridge in Beverly Hills, which is listed for $13.5 million.\nThe Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Robby Sutton and Rayni Williams are the listing agents. Property records show a family trust is selling the home.\nThe Trousdale Estates residence has five bedrooms and five bathrooms across nearly 5,000 square feet. It offers big views of Century City, Downtown Los Angeles, the ocean and the Santa Monica Mountains.\nThe Mid-Century modern home was designed by Rex Lotery, the architect behind Elvis Presley\u2019s Trousdale Estates home.\n",

Additionally, Vistria Group, in its first ground-up development, is infusing $120 million in equity and taking a majority stake in the project as a limited partner. Alloy, as general partner, will continue to lead development and is kicking in $40 million.\nAccording to Alloy, the 730-foot tower is slated to be the world\u2019s tallest built to passive house standards, a design method aimed at cutting energy costs through extreme insulation. The project is the second phase of \u201cAlloy Block,\u201d which includes the city\u2019s first all-electric skyscraper at 505 State Street and two public schools (also passive house) at 489 State Street.\n\nOne Third Avenue will include 143 affordable housing units, with monthly rents starting at $1,023 per month. These apartments will be reserved for tenants earning, on average, 60 percent of the area median income.\nResidential space will span the 11th through 60th floors, and the tower\u2019s podium will include 60,000 square feet of office space. Two buildings constructed in the 1800s on State Street and Schermerhorn Street will also be incorporated into the development, and house 30,000 square feet of retail space.\nDemolition work on the site began earlier this year, and the development team expects to begin construction in the fall.\nWhen finished, Alloy Block is expected to include more than 1,000 homes, with 200 set aside as permanently affordable. The electric tower at 505 State Street was completed in July 2024. The developers\nsecured\n$290 million to replace a $210 million construction loan in December.\n",

The firm wants to turn the low-rise shopping center into a mixed-use complex with nearly 500 units.\nRosenwach proposed a 412,000-square-foot complex that would be between eight and ten stories tall. The property would include 492 residential units, 25 percent of which would be affordable for those earning a maximum of 60 percent of the area median income.\nThe proposal also includes a significant retail component \u2014 62,000 square feet in all on the ground floor, including a 2,300-square-foot cafe and gallery \u2014 which would allow the tenants of LaGuardia Center to remain in place when the redevelopment is completed.

Because of previous work, however, Rosenwach expects to qualify for the lapsed 421a tax break, for which construction needs to be completed by the middle of June 2031 after the deadline was extended last year.\nRosenwach acquired the site in 1989 for an undisclosed price and operates out of the address. In addition to being a landlord, the firm also helped develop rooftop water towers across the city.\nElsewhere on Ditmars, Pasadena-based hospitality investor ASAP Holdings\nfiled a rezoning application\ntowards the end of 2023 to replace the 410 parking spaces at the New York LaGuardia Airport Marriott with a mixed-use building containing 437 apartments and a separate structure containing 98 affordable residences for seniors.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Catellus Development and Deca are looking to turn a petroleum refinery near Long Beach into a modern industrial hub with restaurants and retail.\nThe developers have proposed replacing 406 acres of oil-refining operations and another 228-acre refinery site into millions of square feet of industrial space with grocers, restaurants, sports facilities and greenways available to nearby residents, CoStar\nreported\n. If approved, it would be among the largest conversions of previously environmentally hazardous land in California history.\nLast year,\noil giant Phillips 66\ntapped Catellus and Deca to help redevelop its Los Angeles refinery operations which include the 406-acre site at 1660 West Anaheim Street in Wilmington and a 228-acre site at 1520 East Sepulveda Boulevard in Carson. Catellus and Deca have filed plans with the city of Los Angeles for its Five Points Union Specific Plan, which would require zoning changes before any shovels can hit dirt.\nAt the Wilmington site, the Anaheim Street land will be split into two portions: A commercial and recreation strip along Anaheim Street with grocery stores, cafes, sports courts and greenways, and a logistics area with warehouses to the south.\n\nThe Wilmington development would stretch across three parcels including the 410-acre refinery site, a 10-acre vacant lot north of Anaheim Street and a 20-acre propane and butane storage yard. Plans have yet to be announced for the Carson site, though it could be redeveloped for industrial logistics use. It could also face separate legal and logistical hurdles due to its location in the city of Carson.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time Catellus has undertaken such a project.\nIn 2003, the Emeryville-based firm redeveloped the 200-acre former Pacific Refinery Company near San Francisco into a residential subdivision known as Victoria by the Bay. In order to do that, the company had to remove contaminants from the site, not unlike what it will have to do in Wilmington and Carson.\nMeanwhile, in Huntington Beach, Shopoff Realty is\nlooking to redevelop\nthe\nMagnolia Tank Farm\nwith housing.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",
