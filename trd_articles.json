        "content": "Chetrit Group\u2019s waterfront condo development site in Pompano Beach and its units at the Hollywood Beach Resort condo are headed to a Uniform Commercial Code foreclosure auction.\nThe lender that provided a $17.2 million loan on both properties in 2022 filed for the UCC foreclosure, according to a public notice published in the South Florida Sun Sentinel and\nFloridaPublicNotices.com\n. The auction will be held on Dec. 22, seeking to generate $21.7 million to cover the debt\u2019s principal, interest, default interest and reasonable fees and costs.\nUCC auctions are non-judicial processes in which the ownership interest in the entities that own properties is sold, meaning the winning bidder assumes ownership of the limited liability company holding the real estate. Generally, mezzanine lenders file for UCC foreclosures, which proceed faster than traditional foreclosures that can drag through the courts.\nChetrit\u2019s properties are the 2.5-acre vacant Pompano Beach site at 2507 and 2629 North Ocean Boulevard and 102 condo units at the Hollywood Beach Resort at 101 North Ocean Drive, according to property records. The firm has long planned a\n121-unit condo project\non the Pompano Beach site with a 20-slip marina. Construction hasn\u2019t started, records show.\nJoseph Chetrit declined to comment.\nBorrowers can work out forbearance agreements with lenders by extending loan maturities or securing equity partners, often to postpone auctions to give them more time to come up with capital.\nBoth sites are encumbered with debt from New York-based Madison Realty Capital, led by Josh Zegen, Brian Shatz and Adam Tantleff. In 2022, Madison provided Chetrit with a\n$94 million\nloan on the Pompano Beach property and a\n$78 million\nloan to purchase the Hollywood Beach Resort units.\nLast year, Chetrit avoided a UCC foreclosure attempt by Madison on the loans by chipping in a significant amount of capital to refinance the debt, extending the Pompano Beach financing by six months and the Hollywood Beach Resort financing by a year, a source told\nThe Real Deal\nat the time.\nMadison declined to comment.\nMadison has been a frequent lender to Chetrit. In 2021, it provided a\n$310 million\nconstruction loan for Chetrit\u2019s planned 4 million-square-foot project on the Miami River that at full buildout would include 1,900 apartments and condos; 39,000 square feet of retail, office space; a 17-slip marina and 770 parking spaces.\nThe first phase, consisting of a 54-story, 632-unit luxury apartment tower on the site at 275 Southwest Sixth Street in Miami, is nearly completed.\nThis year, Adam Neumann\u2019s Flow, Canada Global and billionaire Yakir Gabay\u2019s Yellowstone Trust bought a\npartnership stake\nin the Miami River project. Chetrit kept a \u201csignificant minority\u201d stake.",

New York-based 601W was reported to\nbe in contract\nto buy the building in September, but Werner\u2019s involvement was not disclosed at the time.\nThe deal breaks down to $310 per square foot. JPMorgan Chase provided a $100 million balance sheet loan to finance the acquisition.\nA Newmark team including Adam Spies, Doug Harmon and Adam Doneger arranged the sale, while the firm\u2019s Jordan Roeshlaub and Nick Scribani led the way on financing.\nTenants at the office building include the City University of New York, Fedcap Rehabilitation Services and the United Way of New York City. Ownership completed a $15 million renovation in 2013, upgrading elevators and updating the Art Deco-style lobby. There are more than 3,600 square feet of green roofs as well as retail space on the ground floor. The building also benefits from its proximity to Grand Central Terminal.\nDurst patriarch Joseph Durst bought the building for his nascent real estate empire more than 80 years ago. The 532,000-square-foot, 21-story property was developed in 1927 and designed by Starrett &amp; Van Vleck.\nIts future may not be as an office building, though. The incoming owners are considering a partial conversion of the property. The upper floors of the building, which are vacant, could work for residential use; alternatively, they could be transformed into a contiguous block for a dedicated office tenant.\nWerner and 601W did not respond to the publication\u2019s requests for comment.\nWerner, of course, is no stranger to office-to-residential conversion, including in Midtown East.\nThe investor partnered with Nathan Berman\u2019s Metro Loft Management on a\nconversion\nat 675 Third Avenue, another former Durst property that traded for nine figures. The conversion plans call for a 464-unit building spanning 321,000 square feet.\nThe two are also partners at 235 East 42nd Street, where they are transforming the former Pfizer headquarters into 1,500 rental units, the largest office-to-residential conversion in New York City.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Sonder\u2019s\nsudden implosion\nthis week is spilling over into the New York real estate world.\nThe Moinian family, among the city\u2019s most prominent landlords, sued the collapsed hospitality firm for at least $10 million in damages and is moving to retake control of two Manhattan properties leased to Sonder that have descended into turmoil since the company\u2019s shutdown, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe lawsuit, filed Tuesday in state Supreme Court in Manhattan, claims that guests at the Moinians\u2019 buildings \u2014 2 Washington Street in the Financial District and 37 West 24th Street in NoMad \u2014 have either refused to vacate their rooms or been locked out and unable to retrieve their belongings after Sonder shuttered operations Monday afternoon.\nThe family accuses Sonder of abandoning the sites and leaving them to deal with the fallout as the San Francisco-based company heads toward bankruptcy.\nAt the center of the Moinians\u2019 claim are two Sonder-run properties totaling about 400 units. Joseph Moinian\u2019s group leased 14 floors at 2 Washington under a 10-year deal signed in 2020 for roughly $1.3 million a month, according to filings, while his brother Morris of Fortuna Realty Group owns the 120-room property at 37 West 24th, formerly the Hotel Henri. Both landlords say they\u2019ve been left with unpaid rent as Sonder unraveled.\nSonder, once touted as an alternative to Airbnb, collapsed after Marriott International terminated a key partnership,\nciting a default\nunder a 2024 licensing deal. Interim CEO Janice Sears said the firm was \u201cdevastated\u201d to liquidate after costly integration delays with Marriott\u2019s systems and a steep revenue slide.\nThe fallout extends beyond the Moinians. Sonder operated roughly 10 Manhattan locations, including buildings owned by Silverstein Properties, BLDG Management and the Chehebar family, all left grappling with stranded guests and uncertain lease obligations.\nFor landlords, Sonder\u2019s collapse underscores the risks of the master-lease model that fueled its growth during the short-term rental boom. The company\u2019s Chapter 7 filing could take months, leaving high-profile owners caught in limbo over how \u2014 and when \u2014 they can reclaim their assets.\nNeither the Moinians\u2019 attorney nor a family spokesperson commented to the publication by press time. Sonder did not respond to requests for comment.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

As a result, more homes that would have traded off market in previous years are now trickling to the MLS, agents say.\nAn off-market oasis\nClubhouse and ALN aren\u2019t the only subscription-based private listing sites in Austin, but they\u2019re perhaps the most prominent. Each has hundreds of users \u2014 a fraction of the tens of thousands of agents in Austin, but a sizable contingent compared to similar groups in other cities.\n\u201cIn other markets, both in Texas and elsewhere in the country, deals are being done off market. It\u2019s just much more underground, and there isn\u2019t necessarily this one unified space,\u201d Clubhouse co-founder Justin Shapiro said.\nThat\u2019s because agents don\u2019t want to risk\npunishment from their local board of Realtors\n, Shapiro said. That\u2019s less of a concern in Austin.\n\u201cTo our knowledge, the Austin Board of Realtors is well aware of Clubhouse and Austin Luxury Network and other platforms, and they seem to be fine with it,\u201d Shapiro said.\nDouglas Elliman agent Michael Reisor, who works in New York as well as Austin and regularly handles off-market transactions, agreed.\n\u201cOff-market is used by a significant number of agents in the city,\u201d Reisor said. \u201cAustin\u2019s off-market scene is pretty robust compared to others.\u201d\nEmpowered by a lenient board, Austin\u2019s not-so-black market also meets a strong local demand for private listings. Texas doesn\u2019t require parties to\ndisclose sale prices\n, and Austin has some of the highest property taxes in the state. As a result, Austin luxury sellers have a strong incentive to hide the true value of their home from the tax appraiser.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re paying 2.5, 3 percent on your valuation, and all of a sudden you record a sale for $11 million \u2014 yikes,\u201d said Douglas Elliman agent Jeanne Parker.\nConsequently, most Austin homes above $2 million and almost all homes above $10 million have generally sold privately, said Douglas Elliman agent Jeff Burke and other agents.\nDrying up\nThere are 400 single-family homes and condos asking at least $1.5 million on the Austin Luxury Network, one user said. There are about a thousand such properties for sale in the same areas on the Austin MLS, meaning ALN accounts for about 30 percent of the total share of listings. Homes on Clubhouse make up another percentage.\nThis share of off-market sales has likely shrunk since last year, and certainly since the resi boom of 2021.\n\u201cYour ultra-luxury listings just aren\u2019t selling like they used to,\u201d said Clubhouse co-founder Alissa Shapiro.\nAustin is a buyer\u2019s market\n. The city has been pushing 6 months inventory throughout 2025, marking the\nhighest level of supply since 2011\n. It had the highest ratio of sellers to buyers in the country last month, according to\nRedfin\n. It also tied with Houston for the\ngreatest decrease in median home price in the country\n, according to CoStar.\nAs a result, some Austin sellers are giving up on off-market networks.\n\u201cAgents and sellers are looking for maximum exposure right now because the market is slower,\u201d Burke said.\nMore properties are moving to the MLS after lingering on ALN, agents including Burke and Parker said.\nOn the other hand, at least some of these moves are planned. Many agents use ALN and Clubhouse to present coming-soon properties to eligible buyers before a public launch, according to Jackson.\n\u201cPeople use these platforms to test price,\u201d said Katie Jackson, an agent at @properties Lone Star Christie\u2019s International Real Estate in Austin.\nClubhouse declined to share data about listings or deals.\n\u201cWe have new agents joining every week, which, to me, is a testament to the fact that they are utilizing platforms like ours to get deals done,\u201d Justin Shapiro said.\n",

But New York City is not the rest of the country.\nRent in the city stayed elevated in October despite expected seasonal trends and\ncooling mortgage rates\n. Median rent for a new, brokered, market-rate lease in Manhattan was $4,600 in October, according to a monthly report from appraisal firm Miller Samuel for Douglas Elliman.\nThat was a\n$50 increase from September\n, but a 7 percent increase year-over-year.\nAlthough rents have come down across the country, New York City rents have been buoyed by a strong local economy, said report author Jonathan Miller.\nRents that rise faster than inflation may be good for landlords who are seeing expenses grow. But elevated rents have also contributed to affordability concerns, a cornerstone of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani\u2019s successful campaign.\n\u201cRents are still growing at more than twice the rate of inflation,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThat encapsulates the affordability crisis in housing perfectly.\u201d\nManhattan\u2019s median rent reached a record in February\nand remained high through the summer,\nclimbing to a $4,700 peak in July\n. That was likely in part due to elevated mortgage rates keeping would-be buyers in the rental market, Miller said.\nThe trend has been similar in Brooklyn and Northwest Queens. Median rents for a new, brokered, market-rate lease in those areas reached $3,850 and $3,598 in October, respectively. Median rents grew by 6.9 percent year-over-year in Brooklyn and 7.4 percent year-over-year in Northwest Queens.\nAlthough median rents usually fall in the city with cooler weather and flagging demand, that hasn\u2019t quite come to pass. October matched August\u2019s median for the third-highest Manhattan rent on record. Nearly 18 percent of Manhattan leases were signed after a bidding war, up a percentage point from a year ago.\nThat\u2019s in contrast to the national trend. Rising unemployment and moderating wage growth are contributing to softer demand. GDP has grown, but\nlargely driven by AI-related capital expenditures\n, according to a report from JPMorgan. Add in the rise of development seen in the last few years, and you have a recipe for lower rents.\nBut the Big Apple has fared better. The securities industry, which powers a good portion of the city\u2019s economy, continues to bring in\nrecord profits\n, according to the state comptroller\u2019s office. That may be contributing to a sharp rise in prices for Manhattan\u2019s luxury market: The top decile of listings has seen median rents rise 20 percent since last October, coming to $11,995.\nWith the election in the books and Mamdani headed to Gracie Mansion, some uncertainty has been eliminated from the housing market, Miller said. Mamdani made promoting affordability for renters a key part of his mayoral campaign and has pledged to use his\nsway over the Rent Guidelines Board to freeze prices\nin rent-stabilized apartments, nearly half of the city housing stock.\nAlthough that would increase affordability for those tenants, it would also likely lead to accelerated rent growth in market-rate apartments, Miller said. Landlords, who are facing steep inflation in their expenses, will attempt to make up the difference in net income on any market-rate units they own.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still looking at upward pressure in rents going forward,\u201d Miller said, \u201cno matter how the economy performs.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Multifamily construction activity in New York City\nis contending with record lows\n\u2014 but could be showing some signs of life.\nThe third quarter of 2025 saw the lowest number of multifamily construction starts in the city since 2011, according to CoStar data shared with\nThe Real Deal\n. Only 894 units began foundation work last quarter.\nHowever, the number of units proposed by developers surged in the same period, according to separate data from the Real Estate Board of New York published Wednesday. Developers filed permits for 11,746 multifamily units in the period, a 69 percent increase from the prior quarter.\nThat number is the highest since the first quarter of 2022 and approaching the number of units that would need to be built each quarter to reach the city and state\u2019s\nmoonshot housing goal of 500,000 new homes\n.\nTo be sure, not all of those proposed units are likely to be built. Developers often face financial and legal hurdles in the time between filing permit applications for a project and starting the foundation.\nBut the boost in filings likely reflects how city and state policies are encouraging new housing, said Henry Perez-Tlatenchi, senior data and policy researcher at REBNY.\n\u201cYou\u2019re starting to see a jump start of people who were essentially waiting for the economics of development to work out,\u201d said Perez-Tlatenchi.\nPart of the resurgence in proposed multifamily construction is the return of a tax abatement program for rental housing.\nProposed rental units peaked in early 2022, as developers raced to qualify sites\nfor the 421-a tax abatement program\n, which paused property taxes for certain rental buildings that had started construction by that summer.\nBut unit proposals flagged after that, as developers faced an uncertain tax future. In late 2024, the\nstate passed the 485-x tax abatement program\n, which has since restarted the development pipeline.\nOther city and state policies, including those proposed in\nMayor Eric Adams\u2019 City of Yes plan\n, have encouraged density and, thus, more unit proposals.\n\u201cWe know that permits will eventually lead to some more units,\u201d said Victor Rodriguez, senior director of analytics at CoStar. \u201cBut the biggest question is, how many and when?\u201d\nAnd, despite the overall resurgence of filings, the pipeline for large-scale development appears to have taken a hit. Of the 207 multifamily buildings proposed last quarter, only 12 were planned for more than 100 units.\nThat\u2019s largely due to\nthe specifics of the new 485-x program\n, according to Perez-Tlatenchi. Developers planning to build more than 100 units need to comply with construction wage requirements to participate in the tax program. That adds compliance costs, and for really large buildings, makes projects difficult to pencil out.\nRental projects of 150 units or more in high-demand areas of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens need to pay construction workers either $64 and $74 per hour to participate in the program, depending on location. That increases costs by 29 percent in Williamsburg, Greenpoint and Long Island City over the previous tax incentive program, according to REBNY estimates.\nAlthough midsize development powered the city to approach its housing goals this quarter, that might not continue, Perez-Tlatenchi said.\n\u201cHistorically, what has driven our residential development, and the numbers behind that, has been large-scale development,\u201d Perez-Tlatenchi said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s clear that\u2019s not happening.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The Beverly Hills Estates plans to open an office in the Pacific Palisades as it expands its presence amid ramped rebuilding post wildfires.\nJacqueline Chernov\n, who joined the brokerage in\nMarch\nfrom Compass, will head the office, which is called the Palisades Estates.\nChernov\nhinted at the business division when she made the jump to the brokerage in July. It will start with an Airstream trailer located on a lot owned by Chernov in the Alphabet Streets.\nThe unconventional workspace is in line with the Beverly Hills Estates, which dubs itself as a social club over simply a brokerage. Its West Hollywood headquarters boasts plush booth-style seating in the office\u2019s center common area, along with an in-house caf\u00e9 offering smoothies, coffee and pastries to agents and guests.\nThe Airstream will be set up in the next month in a neighborhood that was one of the\nhardest hit by January\u2019s Palisades Fire\n. Chernov also has a home in the Huntington neighborhood, which she\u2019s working with a contractor on to rebuild within the next 14 to 16 months.\nRayni Williams, co-founder and CEO of the Beverly Hills Estates, said the brokerage has always been keen on Los Angeles\u2019 Westside. Chernov has been a \u201cgo-to, favorite\u201d area agent that the two have worked with even prior to her joining the company.\nChernov said the brokerage is looking for permanent office space on Sunset Boulevard, near the Erewhon inside Rick Caruso\u2019s\nPalisades Village\nshopping center, which would place the Palisades Estates in the center of town.\nThat\u2019s also near where Sotheby\u2019s International Realty has an office, which reopened in late September. Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices California Properties also had an office in the center of town on nearby Alma Real Drive.\nThe goal is to build out an office specializing in land, teardowns, rebuild sites and connections to architects and builders, among other services. Chernov is looking to staff up Palisades Estates to about 20 agents and they\u2019ve got about half that right now.\nShe\u2019s in talks with some local agents about making the move. Branden said they\u2019re coming from both boutiques and larger brokerages in the area.\nThe Beverly Hills Estates is already ramping its presence in the community, inking a deal to sponsor the annual Palisades Turkey Trot. That\u2019ll expose its brand to the over 2,000 people who signed up for the race on Thanksgiving Day.\nPalisades Estates is the first step in a broader strategy that will plant the Beverly Hills Estates in key high-end markets locally as it looks to grow, while maintaining its stature as a boutique brokerage.\n\u201cOur goal is to open five divisions throughout the city and remain a small boutique firm with the highest execution of customer service and luxury residential real estate,\u201d Branden said.\nThat could potentially include the Valley, Malibu, Montecito and the Eastside.\nNext month, the brokerage is set to launch the first episode of its podcast, which shares the same name as the company\u2019s tag line: \u201cEstate of Mind.\u201d\nThe podcast will feature the Williamses, along with Chernov and her daughter Zoe, with a focus on what Rayni described as \u201call things lifestyle.\u201d\nThe Beverly Hills Estates\nranked No. 11\non this year\u2019s list of the top brokerages in Los Angeles County, generating sales volume of $1.5 billion across 305 transactions, according to\nTRD Data\n. The production was between July 1, 2024 and July 1, 2025 and did not include off-market deals or those under $1 million.\n",

        "content": "Intrigue around the timing aside, it didn\u2019t mean much when Scott Wiener, the housing policy guru who represents San Francisco in California\u2019s state senate, entered the race for Congress\u2019s 11th district more than a month ago. Challenging Nancy Pelosi isn\u2019t necessarily a winning strategy. But then came some\npolitical calculus\nthat put Wiener\u2019s perch as one of the most transformative California legislators of his generation in a different light.\nOn Thursday, Pelosi announced she wouldn\u2019t seek reelection to a 21st term. A few days later, Christine Pelosi, who many believed to be the former speaker\u2019s heir apparent, announced she wasn\u2019t interested in her mother\u2019s seat.\nIn a post on X,\nthe younger Pelosi instead revealed a plan to seek San Francisco\u2019s state senate seat, currently held by Wiener.\nOnce you iron out the tangle of political fates, it\u2019s clear that, without a Pelosi in the race, Wiener has suddenly risen as the frontrunner for a seat he has long sought. He\u2019s already raised more than $1 million, far ahead of his most prominent challenger, Saikat Chakrabarti, the former chief of staff for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Now, real estate executives are musing on whether Wiener, if successful, can carry that housing momentum to Washington.\nHis platform indicates he at least plans to. Housing largely exists as a city hall and, more recently, a statehouse issue, but Wiener lists it as his top priority if elected to Congress.\nHis track record adds weight to such ambition\u2013since Wiener\u2019s election to the state senate in 2016, California has multiplied the housing production it requires from cities and counties. The same tenure saw the legislature strengthen the state\u2019s\nenforcement credentials\nand empower the attorney general\u2019s office to go after local jurisdictions that fall short of the housing mandates.\nWeiner authored a number of bills crucial to establishing leverage for the state, cutting into the local control over zoning held exclusively by cities and counties. His SB 79,\nsigned by Gov. Gavin Newsom last month\n, offered the most recent example: it automatically upzoned the land along major transit lines in eight of the state\u2019s most populous counties.\nDavid Garcia, policy director for Up For Growth, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit focused on housing legislation, emphasized Weiner would face a very different legislative landscape if he wins Pelosi\u2019s seat.\n\u201cThe policies that have been pursued in California wouldn\u2019t translate to Congress, and it\u2019s unlikely that Congress would support the feds pre-empting local zoning laws,\u201d Garcia told The Real Deal.\nIndeed, the federal government has historically dealt in the financing side of the equation. The creation of the 30-year mortgage, the distribution of low-income housing tax credits, and the Community Reinvestment Act, which pressed banks to provide capital for affordable housing projects, are all federal initiatives.\nWithin that financing realm, Garcia said a pro-housing legislator could push for new tax credits that facilitate specific construction types, such as missing middle housing and accessory dwelling units.\nYet, the simple creation of new financing tools will mean nothing if they\u2019re not made easier to use, said Jon White, chief real estate officer of Abode, the Bay Area\u2019s largest non-profit housing developer.\n\u201cAffordable housing projects will only turn to federal financing if the project depends on it, because it\u2019s so hard to deal with,\u201d White told The Real Deal. \u201cStreamling would be really helpful.\u201d\nFederal money often comes with a suite of what many developers and pro-housing advocates see as onerous and expensive requirements, including compliances with the National Environmental Protection Act, using American-made construction materials, and paying prevailing wages. Some of this is familiar territory for Wiener, who helped push through\nlandmark legislation to reform and streamline\nthe California Environmental Quality Act earlier this year, which had increasingly become a tool for opponents to slow or block housing developments.\nWhite, who called himself \u201ca fan\u201d of Wiener\u2019s work in the state legislature, said he wants to see Congress expand project-based vouchers \u2014 an important housing subsidy that White called the \u201clifeblood\u201d of deeply affordable and permanent supportive housing developments \u2014 and address skyrocketing insurance costs. He said insurance rates have increased as much as 300% for housing developers in recent years.\n\u201cA lot of projects at Abode are under water because of insurance cost increases, and it\u2019s going to take a national solution to figure out insurance,\u201d White said.\nYet, not everyone believes Wiener will have the same latitude to effect housing if he wins Pelosi\u2019s seat next year.\nThe CEO of one of California\u2019s largest for-profit developers sang Wiener\u2019s praises as \u201csmart, relentless, detail-oriented and willing to take risks,\u201d and referred to him as the \u201cthe most pro-housing legislator in California.\u201d But he believes Wiener\u2019s influence, if he reaches Congress, could become diluted by representing a Democratic stronghold and as one of 435 votes in the House of Representatives.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be transformational, you can make more of a difference in housing at the state level than the federal level, that\u2019s just a fact,\u201d said the CEO, who only agreed to speak on background out of concern for getting too involved in an active race. \u201cI\u2019d start by saying, \u2018Do no harm.\u2019 But frankly, I\u2019m not looking at Congress to be the major movers on housing policy.\u201d\nOn this point, Abode\u2019s chief real estate officer White sees an inverse reality. Although Wiener has been among the most effective legislators in California, the statehouse is now filled with lawmakers cut from a similar pro-housing cloth, and Weiner\u2019s legacy of hammering on housing appears to leave Sacramento in good stead.\n\u201cOn the federal side, there\u2019s not many people who understand affordable housing in Congress,\u201d White said. \u201cHis expertise could be way more valuable in Congress. We have a strong bench in the state, but the federal government needs more experience.\u201d\nA sea change could be shaping up in the U.S. Capitol, though.\u00a0 Over the last few years, a bipartisan, pro-housing YIMBY Caucus (Yes, In My Backyard) has formed, and just last month the Senate passed the ROAD to Housing Act, a 300-page bill led by otherwise strange political bedfellows Sens. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass). A key provision of the bill would tie the amount of federal money a city or county receives through the Community Development Block Grant program to the amount of housing it produces.\nThat adds up to a \u201csignificant shift\u201d for Congress that seemed like an impossibility even just a year ago, according to Up for Growth\u2019s Garcia.\n\u201cThere would have been a time that a new member would get to Congress and talk about housing and not be taken seriously, because it just wasn\u2019t on anyone\u2019s radar,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cNow, if Scott Wiener wins, he will find himself among many other members talking about housing supply. And I think he would come to Congress with the biggest track record for doing really big housing policy.\u201d\n\n",

        "content": "The Cornerstone Group and Brookstone Partners propose a 354-unit multifamily tower in Miami\u2019s Little Havana neighborhood, amid an apartment building frenzy in South Florida.\nCornerstone and Brookstone, both based in Hollywood, want to develop an eight-story building with a 5,000-square-foot grocery store on a 2.4-acre site on the northwest corner of Northwest Eighth Avenue and West Flagler Street, according to an application attached to a Miami board\u2019s agenda. The assemblage is at 826, 834, 842, 852 and 860 Northwest First Street; 805, 815, 827, 835, 843, 853 and 861 West Flagler Street; and 26 Northwest Eighth Avenue.\nThe Miami Urban Development Review Board will vote on the proposal at its meeting on Wednesday, including on the developers\u2019 waiver requests. Cornerstone and Brookstone seek a 10 percent reduction of required parking spaces, a bigger spacing between residential entrances and other waivers from the city code.\nDesigned by Corwil Architects, the building will consist of 38 studios, 170 one-bedroom apartments and 146 two-bedroom apartments, according to the application. It also will have a 500-space garage and 26 on-street spaces.\nCornerstone and Brookstone are affiliated and share a Hollywood headquarters, according to their websites. Both are led by Jorge Lopez, Leon J. Wolfe and Mara Mades.\nThe firms bought the majority of the development site for\n$15 million\nin 2023, records show. They also paid $825,000 for the property at 26 Northwest Eighth Avenue, according to records.\nSellers New York-based Posner Group and Miami Beach builders Todd Michael Glaser and i3 Development, led by Alan I. Amdur, had planned a mixed-use project for the site. They scored a\n$26.5 million\nacquisition, pre-development and construction loan in 2021. They planned a three-story, 52,500-square-foot retail building and a two-level garage with 217 parking spaces for the first phase, and a 20-story multifamily building with retail for the second phase.\nAcross South Florida, developers continue to propose and build multifamily projects, despite a\nsupply overhang\nthat\u2019s led to slower lease-ups, increased concessions and a decline in rents. In September, the median asking rent in the tri-county region was $2,298, a 3 percent drop from the same month last year, according to Realtor.com.\nDevelopers with apartments under construction say\ndemand will catch up\n, and rent growth will resume by the time they complete their buildings next year and in 2027.\nIn downtown Miami, Great Neck, New York-based Namdar Group is expected to complete a\n43-story, 680-unit\napartment tower at 55 Northeast Second Street early next year, and started construction in September of an adjacent\u00a0 43-story, 714-unit tower at 50 Northeast Third Street.\nKeystone Development + Investment is working on an office-to-residential conversion near Dadeland Mall, creating\n212 apartments\n, combined, at the office buildings at 9400 South Dadeland Boulevard and 9500 South Dadeland Boulevard in unincorporated Miami-Dade County.\n",

Pei-designed building \u2014 pegged between $152 million and $345 million \u2014 against relocating city operations elsewhere. The decision kicks off what supporters call a fact-finding mission, not a commitment to move.\n\u201cThere are a lot of questions about City Hall,\u201d Council member Chad West said, noting the city won\u2019t get answers \u201cunless we have the evaluation.\u201d Deputy Mayor Pro-Tem Gay Donnell Willis added that the city owes taxpayers a full accounting of the land\u2019s value and \u201chighest and best use.\u201d\nBut opponents say the process could pave the way for demolition of a\ncultural icon\n. Council member Paul Ridley, who voted against the measure along with Paula Blackmon and Cara Mendelsohn, argued the city should first get a professional assessment of City Hall\u2019s\ncondition\nbefore \u201ctalking to every downtown landlord about moving.\u201d\nRidley added that a steep increase in repair estimates from two years ago needs to be explored, citing a $54 million figure from June 2023.\nResidents\nlargely sided with preservationists.\nOf nearly 30 speakers during Wednesday\u2019s meeting, most urged the city to repair rather than replace the building, which sits across from the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center \u2014 itself set for a multibillion-dollar rebuild.\nA \u201cSave Dallas City Hall\u201d petition has drawn more than 3,500 signatures so far.\nCity staff will now study the costs and logistics of repairing versus leasing, buying or constructing new facilities, including new sites for emergency operations, the 311 and 911 call centers, and City Council chambers.\nThey\u2019ll also analyze how redeveloping the current site could align with downtown revitalization plans and boost tax revenue.\nThe resolution requires findings to go before the council\u2019s finance committee by February. Meanwhile, the city\u2019s Landmark Commission has already begun proceedings to give City Hall historic designation, temporarily shielding it from demolition.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Her campaign then quietly deleted the promise from her website.\nHudson\u2019s Council campaign accepted donations from developers and lobbyists with active business before her office, filings show, even as her website declared she wouldn\u2019t take money from \u201cfor-profit real estate developers\u201d or \u201clobbyists who represent real estate.\u201d\nThe disclaimer, visible from 2021 through August 2024, was scrubbed sometime after that, months after checks cleared.\nHudson told the public her team removed the pledge during her 2025 reelection campaign \u201cto reflect the changing reality of campaign finance,\u201d calling suggestions of pay-to-play \u201cdeeply insulting.\u201d She cited examples of rejecting developer-backed projects, arguing her record proves she\u2019s \u201cunbought and unbossed.\u201d\nStill, records show that while her pledge was live, Hudson accepted nearly $1,900 from lobbyists registered to lobby her on behalf of developers. One of them, Bolton St. John\u2019s partner Teresa Gonzalez, donated $250 in 2022 while lobbying Hudson on a mixed-use project from Hudson Companies, then another $250 in 2024 tied to a separate proposal the councilmember ultimately opposed.\nHudson also took a matchable $250 donation from Simba Property Group CEO Jordan Sakni in March, after deleting the pledge. A smaller 2023 contribution from a Madison International Realty analyst turned into $1,575 under the city\u2019s public matching program.\nThe contradictions could complicate Hudson\u2019s bid to lead the Council, where the speaker wields heavy influence over rezonings and development priorities citywide. Hudson, who represents Crown Heights, Prospect Heights and Clinton Hill, is running as the progressive alternative to Manhattan Councilmember Julie Menin, a more centrist Democrat.\nThe controversy lands weeks before members vote internally on a speaker to replace Adrienne Adams, whose term is set to expire on Dec. 31. Hudson\u2019s alignment with Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani \u2014 a Democratic socialist who publicly pledged to not accept donations from the real estate industry \u2014 could prove a boost or a liability.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Brooklyn real estate investor Sanford Solny is headed to prison for a\nyears-long deed theft\nscheme that stripped homeowners \u2014 many of them immigrants and people of color \u2014 of their properties.\nSolny, 68, was sentenced Wednesday to up to seven years behind bars after being convicted in June on 17 counts, including grand larceny, scheme to defraud and criminal possession of stolen property, the New York Times\nreported\n. The ruling caps a case that became a flashpoint for New York\u2019s growing fight against deed theft, a form of property fraud.\nBrooklyn Supreme Court Justice Danny Chun ordered that 11 stolen deeds be nullified, potentially allowing victims to reclaim homes. But Chun stopped short of granting restitution, meaning Solny won\u2019t have to return the roughly $500,000 in rent he collected after evicting owners and installing tenants.\nSolny, a disbarred attorney from Midwood, pitched struggling homeowners on \u201cshort sales,\u201d promising to negotiate with banks to wipe away debt. Instead, prosecutors said, he transferred the deeds to himself or shell companies while leaving mortgages and tax obligations in the original owners\u2019 names. Victims testified that the scams left them homeless, financially ruined and fighting for more than a decade to undo fraudulent transfers.\nOutside the courtroom, there was a standoff between Solny\u2019s supporters and supporters of the victims. Inside the courtroom, victims described the long toll of the fraud.\n\u201cBecause of Sanford Solny, I lost my home. I lost all my furniture and I lost all the work that I put into my home,\u201d Janet Bruce, who emigrated from Guyana and bought her Flatbush home in 2006 before losing it in 2014, wrote in a statement to the court.\nThe sentencing followed a prior conviction in Queens in 2018 for similar crimes, when Solny received five years\u2019 probation. Last month, Solny was\nremanded\nto custody during a hearing in Queens after allegedly violating his probation. The move seemingly came as a surprise to Solny, as it was on the eve of Yom Kippur and he didn\u2019t have his medicine on him.\nProsecutors noted that at least one of his Brooklyn thefts occurred after that earlier sentence, a sign he kept the grift going even while under court supervision.\nDeed theft is challenging to prosecute, as intent needs to be shown and victims typically sign legally-binding documents, allowing perpetrators to frame schemes as legal business deals.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The buyer, an affiliate of Los Angeles-based\nJRK Property Holdings\n, led by Jay Lippman, paid $41.6 million below the previous sale price four years ago.\nBerkadia\u2019s Jaret Turkell and Omar Morales brokered the deal.

The Lerner family bought the Washington Nationals in 2006 for $450 million.\nLerner\u2019s sale to JRK marks a significant price drop, underscoring ongoing revaluations in\nsouth Florida\u2019s multifamily market\namid an oversupply of apartments, a slowdown in rent growth, high interest rates and constraints on equity capital.\nIn Palm Beach Gardens, Boston-based West Shore this month bought a 542-unit apartment complex for\n$117.9 million\n. The seller, Aventura-based Advenir, paid $97.3 million for the property in 2018, but also took out an $80 million loan the same year to renovate the 34 two-story rental buildings, a storage building and a clubhouse.\nCompleted in 2019 on a 0.8-acre site, Motion at Dadeland spans roughly 514,600 square feet. The tower offers studios, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments. Motion at Dadeland also has 8,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space. Asking rents range from $1,955 to $4,310 a month, according to Apartments.com\nMiami-based Adler Group, 13th Floor Investments, and Barings developed Motion at Dadeland with a\n$50 million\nconstruction loan.

        "content": "Southern California developers are increasingly striking deals on land once used for oil extraction.\nOil drilling sites across Los Angeles are being reclaimed for commercial real estate development as the City and County of Los Angeles move to phase out drilling, Commercial Observer\nreported\n. As it stands, there are 68 named oil fields and thousands of wells across the city.\nThose parcels are becoming redevelopment targets as buildable land is scarce and prices are climbing, making former\noil and refinery sites\nattractive in both scale and price. It\u2019s not necessarily easier, however, given the environmental, financial and bureaucratic headaches that can drag projects for years.\n\u201cThey all come with different constraints of different types and different challenges. We like to say, \u2018There\u2019s some hair on this deal.\u2019 Sometimes the hair is of a cleanup nature. There\u2019s something that needs to be cleaned up before it can be properly reused,\u201d Preston Brooks, a real estate attorney dealing with contaminated properties for real estate law firm Cox, Castle &amp; Nicholson, told Commercial Observer. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s going to be these wells. But there\u2019s such a strong appetite for acquiring properties that are otherwise good real estate.\u201d\nInvestors from nonprofits to national REITs are lining up.\nThe Los Angeles Neighborhood Land Trust, for example, is converting a 2-acre site in South L.A. site with 36 decommissioned wells into a park, community center and affordable housing. It purchased the property from Sentinel Peak Resources in 2023 for about $10 million.\n\u201cThis project actually came to us from the community,\u201d executive director Tori Kjer said. \u201cThere was just this coexistence of two land uses that don\u2019t work well together.\u201d\nIn Huntington Beach,\nShopoff Realty\nis pushing a 29-acre\nredevelopment of a site\nformerly known as Magnolia Tank Farm into about 200 single-family homes, a 50-unit affordable multifamily complex, a 215-room hotel and about 19,000 square feet of retail space. Shopoff had purchased the coastal site in 2016; by that time, most of the tank infrastructure on site had been demolished. The firm has already gotten entitlements and approvals from the California Coastal Commission and the Huntington Beach City Council.\nThe biggest swing may be\nPhillips 66\n\u2019s plan to turn its 440-acre Wilmington refinery into Five Points Union, a mixed-use district with 270,000 square feet of retail, 67,500 square feet of restaurant space, a 60,000-square-foot indoor sports facility, two outdoor soccer fields, green space, parking for nearly 2,500 vehicles and eight industrial facilities totaling about 6.1 million square feet. Cleanup alone could top $231 million and take years, with oversight from at least five state and local agencies.\nEven when sites are remediated, developers can\u2019t always count on smooth sailing. Old wells can leak or sit undocumented, creating costly surprises mid-construction, such as like Aragon Properties\u2019 2018 spill in Echo Park or an oil geyser that delayed a Marina del Rey hotel project by a Hardage Hospitality affiliate.\nStill, with housing needs surging and undeveloped land in the region hard to come by, developers are betting that California\u2019s dirtiest dirt could prove to be its most valuable. The City of Los Angeles alone must plan for 456,643 new units of housing by 2029 as part of its\nhousing element\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

The project will also feature underground parking, and Highwood Mayor Charlie Pecaro called it a key step in \u201celevating the residential and dining experience\u201d in the suburb\u2019s core.\nThe project comes as suburban multifamily rents climb. Median net rent across the Chicago suburbs rose 4.1 percent year over year in the second quarter to $2.18 per square foot, according to Integra Realty Resources. Median rent in the North Shore hit $3.04 per square foot, with roughly 750 units under construction as of midyear.\nFor Moyer, the deal extends a run of activity in the luxury rental space. The firm also closed a $29 million loan from Principal Financial last year to build an 84-unit apartment project at 537 West Drummond Place in\nLincoln Park\n, slated to open in spring. That mid-rise will include coworking space, a fitness center, rooftop deck and fire pits \u2014 along with two affordable units, even though the project\u2019s approval predates the city\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance.\nHighwood\u2019s latest project marks a notable evolution for the small North Shore community, where multifamily construction has historically been rare.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The loan is tied to five properties in Denton built between 1962 and 1975. They\u2019re off-campus student housing options for students at the University of North Texas.\nIt\u2019s possible that Jordan Multifamily and Argentic will come to a deal before the auction, which could cancel the sale. If they don\u2019t, the properties will be sold at an auction on Dec. 2 at 10 a.m. at the Denton County Courthouse.\nThe firm could lose a 79-unit complex at 911 Bernard Street; an 80-unit complex at 707 Bernard Street; an 81-unit complex at 1607 West Live Oak Street; an 82-unit complex at 1003 Eagle Drive; and an 83-unit complex at 2424 West Oak Street.\nThe portfolio comprises 405 units; the loan works out to $137,037 per unit. Jordan purchased the properties in 2022.\nThe firm specializes in fixing up older apartment complexes, raising rents and selling them for a profit. The value-add strategy has gone bust for many operators during this economic cycle. They bought older properties when interest rates were low and property values were high. When interest rates skyrocketed, debt service on floating-rate loans ballooned, and construction costs also increased.\nAt the same time, major Texas metros saw a historic flood of apartment developments come online, which put downward pressure on rental rates and occupancy levels.\nAs a result, value-add multifamily operators have faced a lot of distress, making up\nmost of the commercial debt\nheaded to foreclosure each month.\nExperts say there\u2019s more around the corner. In the next five years,\n$19 billion in CMBS loans\ntied to Texas multifamily will mature, CWCapital\u2019s James Shevlin said at a recent Texas multifamily conference hosted by Connect CRE.\n",

The project will also dedicate 5,000 square feet of land as open park space with benches, accessible to the public.\nApex\u2019s partner Sunlight Development bought the lot in 2023 for $9.5 million. Apex plans to spend about $195 million to develop the property using the\n485x tax abatement program\n. The original rezoning application extended beyond Sunlight\u2019s property and sought to rezone three neighboring parcels but those properties were ultimately excluded from the rezoning.\nEsposito said the process reflected a model for how rezonings should unfold \u2014 with negotiation but also an eye toward feasibility.\n\u201cIf you agree to the wrong things, it could really hurt the financeability of ever building a project,\u201d he said. \u201cThis one, we\u2019ll actually be able to deliver.\u201d\n",

        "content": "An all-affordable senior housing complex in Beverly Hills is a step closer to becoming reality.\nThe City of Beverly Hills voted Wednesday to enter into a one-year exclusive negotiation agreement with nonprofit developer West Hollywood Community Housing Corporation regarding a ground lease at 327-335 South Robertson Boulevard.\n\u201cOur hope is to execute a long-term ground lease of 55 years or longer,\u201d Anup Nitin Patel,\ndirector of real estate development for West Hollywood Community Housing Corporation, told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nPlans call for 50 units \u2014 the minimum the developer said it needs for the project to pencil out \u2014 across four to five stories with an additional rooftop amenity level, according to a presentation by Logan Phillippo, real property development manager for the city. The preliminarily proposed development has 49 one-bedroom affordable units age-restricted for those 55 years and older and one on-site manager\u2019s unit, according to\nthe city staff report\n.\nThe project, slated for the west side of Robertson Boulevard between Wilshire and Olympic boulevards, would include retail and private parking.\nBeverly Hills City Parking Authority, a city agency providing and managing public parking facilities, acquired the 13,740-square-foot site for $10.1 million in 2019. The Parking Authority will transfer the site to the city via a quitclaim deed.\nWednesday\u2019s vote allows West Hollywood Community Housing Corporation to demonstrate site control, a requirement for the organization to pursue $3 million in funding from a LA County Affordable Housing Solutions Agency grant. The application for LACAHSA\u2019s Draft Notice of Funding Availability deadline is Dec. 22, Phillippo said.\nWith 50 units, the city estimates the development costs would total $42 million. The site could accommodate up to 80 units. The developer will seek additional public financing to foot the bill.\nThe property is home to a single-story, 6,000-square-foot commercial structure with eight retail spaces of approximately 750 square feet each, according to the staff report. Five of the eight spaces are vacant. The remaining spaces are occupied on a month-to-month basis, with a total rent roll of $9,090 per month.\nEstablished in 1986, West Hollywood Community Housing Corporation develops, owns and operates affordable housing projects in West Hollywood and the greater Los Angeles area. Completed projects include the 42-unit Mariposa Lily, an affordable and permanent supportive housing development in the Pico Union district just west of downtown Los Angeles, and the 93-unit Westmore Linden affordable rental housing for seniors in the neighboring Westlake district.\nThe city has committed to facilitating the development of 557 units of affordable housing on multiple city properties, as described in the housing element of the city\u2019s general plan.\nBeverly Hills Mayor Sharona Nazarian said the site \u201cmakes sense for housing,\u201d rather than its original intention for parking.\nShe noted that several sites originally designated for affordable housing in the city have since been identified as \u201csitting on an active fault line,\u201d so housing cannot be built on them. \u201cAs a result we must look for sites to fulfill our housing obligation,\u201d she added.\nNazarian warned that without proactive action, the city could lose control over its own development, opening the door for large-scale\nbuilder\u2019s remedy projects\nto reshape Beverly Hills.\nBuilder\u2019s remedy is a loophole in state housing law that lets developers skirt zoning rules in cities that fail to certify their state housing plans, as long as they include at least 20 percent affordable housing.\n",

        "pub_date_dt": "2025-11-14T12:30:00",
        "content": "Before 485x, projects with exactly 99 units were rare \u2014 only 13 were filed in 15 years. Last quarter alone, developers filed 21.\nMeanwhile, just 12 of 207 multifamily projects filed were for 100 or more units.\nThese statistics, flagged by a Real Estate Board of New York report Wednesday, might seem like nothing to worry about, given that the unit count in new filings\nsurged to 11,746\n.\nThe problem is that all of these 99-unit sites are zoned for more than 99. In a housing shortage, the last thing the city wants is to leave units on the table or induce developers to inefficiently split projects into several buildings, each under 100 units.\nBut the construction workers\u2019 wage floor that kicks in for 485x projects with 100 or more units is too scary for developers, investors and lenders.\nThe funny thing is, the wages required on 100- to 149-unit projects receiving the state\u2019s 485x tax break (which is essential for mixed-income rental projects) aren\u2019t much different from what developers pay for 99-unit projects. Why not just pay a bit more?\nThe reason: Developers (and their lenders) don\u2019t want to risk falling short of the wage floor \u2014 which can happen even if they are trying to meet it. The penalties are severe. Better to stick to 99 units and not have to worry about compliance costs.\nProjects of 100 or more units are most likely to happen in high-rent areas such as Soho. \u201cThe numbers work,\u201d a developer told me Thursday at a Brooklyn real estate breakfast.\nOne panelist at the event, developer\nSergey Rybak\n, told the audience that the wage floor does drive up costs, but \u201cthe cost of 485x is not such a drastic difference.\u201d He noted that higher wages can mean getting a contractor who works 20 percent faster, offsetting the extra labor expense.\nTrue, but what matters is what is actually happening. And what\u2019s happening are 99-unit projects, and virtually none of 150 or more, where an even higher wage floor kicks in. (This does not apply to fully affordable housing.)\nEvery developer I have asked believes 485x needs to be changed. But I have not found any who think it will be changed in 2026, which is an election year for Gov. Kathy Hochul and state legislators.\nThe reason: The average voter does not care about 485x, but construction unions do.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nThis seems odd. The Wall Street Journal reported Nov. 7 that Blackstone is selling off a $1.8 billion\nsenior housing portfolio\nof about 90 properties, some at more than 70 percent below their purchase price. Five days later, Baker Tilly\u2019s third-quarter commercial real estate report declared, \u201cThe senior housing sector is experiencing a\nstrong rebound\nin 2025, after a period of recovery brought on by significant operational challenges during and after the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Construction spending nationwide was down 4.7 percent (adjusted for inflation) in the past 12 months, according to a\nJLL report\n. The decline came despite increases in spending on data centers, utilities, infrastructure and especially office-to-residential conversions, which doubled. JLL blamed uncertainty caused by \u201cpolicy volatility,\u201d namely unpredictable trade policy (aka tariff chaos) and immigration enforcement.\nElsewhere\u2026\nAs yesterday\u2019s Daily Dirt reported, because of a pending legal challenge, New York will postpone the January start of its law that essentially requires all-electric buildings for projects of seven or fewer stories. The mandate kicks in for larger buildings in 2029.\nBut developers of New York City projects are already making them all-electric. Technology is making electric heat increasingly efficient, and contractors can now make buildings nearly airtight.\nWhile opponents of the bill are framing it as an affordability issue, as is Gov. Kathy Hochul, it seems likely that new buildings will be cheaper to heat and not necessarily more expensive to build.\nThe real issue is how to make existing buildings compliant with the city\u2019s Local Law 97. Richard Lipsky, who is organizing opposition to the law, says Co-op City told him its compliance cost would be more than $2 billion.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$23.5 million\nfor a 3,556-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at 50 West 66th Street in Lincoln Square. Janice Chang and Timothy Hsu with Douglas Elliman had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$85 million\nfor the 136,730-square-foot apartment building at 181 Front Street in Dumbo. The Carlyle Group sold the 105-unit property to an LLC tied to HUBB NYC Properties.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$7.85 million\nfor a 1,941-square-foot condominium unit at 40 Bleecker Street in Noho. Danielle Nazinitsky with Decode Real Estate has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 807,803-square-foot, 792-unit, 38-story project at 45 West Street in Greenpoint. Robert Laudenschlager with SLCE Architects filed the permit on behalf of TF Cornerstone.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

Robinson ruled that CGHCRA owed the Brookfield affiliate, CWI-CG RCFL Property Owner LLC, $7.9 million in financial damages, based on a special assessment for attorneys fees and other legal expenses related to the suit.\n\u201cAfter presiding over this case from its inception, the court is uniquely familiar with the lack of any merit to plaintiff\u2019s legal contentions,\u201d Judge Robinson wrote in the final ruling, adding that the condo association dragged out the suit and demanded unnecessary discovery.\nThe outstanding $7.9 million claim is the most expensive liability listed in the association\u2019s Chapter 11 filing, followed by a $1.5 million claim from Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, which is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, according to the publication.\n\u2013\u2013\nKate Hinsche",

        "content": "Jovanka Novakovic isn\u2019t flinching.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t changed the way I market because of Zillow\u2019s restrictions,\u201d the Chicago-based Compass agent said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a listing where I did anything differently.\u201d\nNovakovic is one of the brokers whose strategy is under fire from Zillow. The issue is over listings on the Chicago MLS-backed Private Listing Network, as Zillow has taken aim at platforms sharing home offerings with brokers that keep them off public websites like its own.\nNovakovic said she uses Compass\u2019 three-phased marketing strategy on all her listings, starting them out as Compass Private Exclusives before going to the Private Listing Network and then to the traditional public MLS. Clients agree to it after she gives them an overview of the process, and she said it gives sellers the opportunity to research the market value of their homes. Around 75 percent of her listings end up on the public market after going through the earlier phases, she said.\nHer experience is part of a broader clash playing out between Zillow and the Chicago-area\u2019s Multiple Listing Service operator known as\nMidwest Real Estate Data (MRED)\nover its Private Listing Network (PLN). The PLN shows brokers subscribed to MRED its listings but keeps them out of view on portals available to the general public.\nZillow\u2019s effort to limit methods like Compass Private Exclusives has also affected how it treats PLN offerings, which it considers to be in violation of its recently updated Listing Access Standards. Although Zillow has been warning Chicago managing brokers that listings hitting the PLN before going public violate the company\u2019s rules, it hasn\u2019t begun enforcing them in the Chicago market and still displays them on its website once they\u2019re publicly for sale.\nOn the other hand, MRED insists the PLN has a place in the housing market and is doubling down on supporting the tactic. In the dispute\u2019s latest step, MRED\u2019s CEO Rebecca Jensen gave a spirited defense of the PLN in a message to her members this week.\nJensen laid out circumstances when a seller might want to use the PLN, including in sensitive situations following divorce or death. The letter didn\u2019t mention Zillow by name, but Jensen made an apparent jab at\nZillow\u2019s new Listing Access Standards\n, saying the PLN is an alternative to \u201ca one-size-fits-all model that restricts options for sellers and their brokers and is devoid of compassion and understanding.\u201d\nThe Private Listing Network, launched in 2016, is an MRED service that lets agents make listings that are visible to all brokers with access to the MLS, but are kept off public websites like Zillow.\nZillow\u2019s recent emphasis on its Listing Access Standards, similar to the National Association of Realtors\u2019\nClear Cooperation Policy\n, requires that a home offering be made available on Zillow within one business day of public marketing. However, Clear Cooperation Policy differs by allowing MLS-wide private listing services like MRED\u2019s.\nBut with Zillow\u2019s policy, marketing a property on a private network then moving it to the public MLS isn\u2019t allowed. Compass has\nsued Zillow\nover the rules, arguing they violate antitrust laws.\nZillow has said private listing networks distort the marketplace, hurt consumers and threaten fair housing standards by concealing some listings from the public. \u201cHidden listing schemes disadvantage sellers and buyers, and that\u2019s what this is,\u201d Zillow said in a previous statement to\nTRD\n.\nJensen\u2019s message brought attention to what she called the \u201cFive Ds\u201d that could prompt a seller to list privately: divorce, death, disability, displacement and downsizing. She framed the PLN as an option rooted in \u201chuman empathy\u201d to prevent broadcasting sellers who want privacy.\n\u201cRigid rules or public exposure that the seller can\u2019t control heightens an already stressful time,\u201d Jensen\u2019s lengthy email said. \u201cWhen we created the PLN, our goal was to honor those experiences while maintaining the transparency and data consistency that make the MLS valuable.\u201d\nMatt Laricy, head of Americorp, one of Chicago\u2019s top brokerages by sales volume, said he received a call from Zillow warning that listings that hit the PLN may not appear on Zillow. Laricy said he\u2019s generally opposed to private listings, but he sometimes moves listings into the PLN during the holiday season when buyer activity slows down, before making them public again.\nLaricy claimed Zillow representatives said they may make exceptions in some cases for circumstances like that, but he hadn\u2019t received confirmation.\n\u201cRight now, the MLS is getting pulled in the middle of this power play between two behemoths of companies,\u201d Laricy said. \u201cThey can\u2019t really afford to be in bad graces with Zillow and they can\u2019t afford to be in bad graces with Compass, so they\u2019re trying to just walk the line and be relevant.\u201d\nMRED hasn\u2019t stated how it will respond if Zillow begins enforcing its company rules, and a spokesperson for the MLS didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. MRED has said its license agreement with Zillow requires Zillow to display all public listings without restriction. But the MLS also hinted it\u2019s not a fan of private exclusives \u2014 a step of seclusion beyond the PLN \u2014 by claiming it will work to give all its registered brokers a look at the full slate of the region\u2019s real estate offerings.\n\u201cMRED\u2019s dedicated to ensuring that all our brokerages and brokers have access to all listings within your market and will equally enforce our rules around displaying MLS data,\u201d Jensen said in the Nov. 12 email.\nEditor\u2019s note: This story has been updated to clarify Zillow\u2019s communications with Novakovic.\n",

        "content": "A fine jeweler is moving its flagship location from a downtown Winnetka storefront to Brookfield Properties\u2019\nOakbrook Center\n, as the mall and the suburb itself are gaining a reputation for courting affluent shoppers and residents.\nLANA Jewelry has a presence across the country at Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom, Bergdorf Goodman and will soon launch at Bloomingdale\u2019s. Operating out of these department stores helped founder Lana Bramlette gain insight into the performance of various malls.\n\u201cWe have all this great data to know which malls and areas are the best performing for us,\u201d she said.\nLANA will join the ranks of other high-end brands including jeweler David Yurman in the luxury section of west suburban Oakbrook Center, a longtime goal of the locally based brand.\n\u201cIt was a dream to be amongst those neighbors; next to a David Yurman and a Gucci and across from a Louis Vuitton,\u201d Bramlette said. \u201cIt was time, in essence, for us to take it to the next level. We\u2019ve been working on this deal for almost a year.\u201d\nWhile Chicago\u2019s North Shore suburbs, including Winnetka, have long been home to the region\u2019s most affluent residents, Oak Brook has been luring those residents and businesses, as well.\nLast month, an Oak Brook mansion sold for $5.3 million, the highest price achieved for a home sale in the suburb in 16 years.\nLANA is not alone in eyeing Oakbrook Center as a top performing mall. Last year, Google chose the mall for\nits first Midwest retail storefront\n.\nThe 3,500-square-foot store was the Silicon Valley giant\u2019s fifth brick-and-mortar location in the U.S. after it opened stores in New York City, California and Boston\nAnd this month, Kim Kardashian\u2019s shapewear brand\nSkims\nopened its second Chicago-area location in Oakbrook. The store\u2019s first Chicago store is in the Gold Coast\u2019s high-end shopping district along\nOak and Rush streets\n.\nThe influx of tenants is the culmination of a nearly-decade long revamp led by Brookfield.\nBrookfield acquired the mall in 2018 as part of a $15 billion buyout of GGP and then led a $177 million renovation of the property.\nThe real estate investing giant took out\na $475 million loan\non the property in 2020 and then secured a $700 million refinancing in 2023. The refinancing was the second largest-shopping mall deal in the country that year. After closing costs, Brookfield raked in $220 million in equity out of the property.\nPrior to the overhaul, the mall had been losing tenants, including Lord &amp; Taylor and Sears.\nAs a part of the $177 million renovation, Brookfield reworked former department store spaces into smaller storefronts that were later filled by tenants including,\u00a0 L.L. Bean, Life Time Fitness, RH Gallery and Sony Wonderverse.\nThe mall\u2019s performance improved steadily as a result, with sales topping $1 billion in 2023, according to Fitch Ratings.\nMomentum at the Oakbrook Center bucks the trend of suburban shopping malls spiraling into financial distress amid the rise of online shopping. In the Chicago area alone, there are at least five ongoing projects to\nrepurpose former suburban shopping malls\ninto multifamily housing and mixed-use districts.",

The asking price equates to $295 per square foot.\nSet on 14.4 acres, the Mt. Vernon-style residence has been in a kind of stately stasis the entire time.\nThe house has been \u201cvery well tended to\u201d under its absentee owners, requiring no repairs but leaving ample budget room for a buyer to remake the interiors, listing agent Gregg Bernadette of HomeSmart Connect told the outlet.\n\u201cAt $6.5 million, you might walk in and drop another million to make it look the way you want,\u201d Bernadette said.\nThe property has paved a long path of price reductions since its first $17 million listing. It most recently fell off the market in September at $6.5 million before reemerging at the same number on Nov. 12. Built atop a rise overlooking a private lake, the home includes seven bedrooms, a dramatic sweeping staircase, ornate fireplaces, a theater and a pool.\nThe seller is the Forsythe Building Fund, tied to power-equipment executive and investor Gerald Forsythe, CEO and chairman of Indeck, whose ventures stretch from industrial plants to pro racing to luxury golf.\nThe fund bought the unfinished structure in 2003 for $1.85 million and poured at least $10 million into completing and upgrading it, Bernadette said. Forsythe has never lived there; the asset was purely an investment play, he confirmed through previous brokers.\nForsythe is also linked to another\nBarrington\nmega-mansion roughly three miles away \u2014 also 22,000 square feet \u2014 that recently went under contract at $6.5 million after once asking $10.5 million.\nCarrying costs on the Old Sutton property have added up: Last year\u2019s tax bill exceeded $94,000, and upkeep for nearly two decades of vacancy stretches far higher. Crews from Forsythe\u2019s commercial holdings routinely maintain the lawn, winterize the home and keep the structure secure.\nThe\nBarrington luxury market\nis thin at this altitude. Only one property north of $6 million sold there this decade: The Barrington Hills mansion featured on\nEmpire\n, which traded in April for $9.4 million after 12 years on the market.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Local brokers can see listings on this private network, but they don\u2019t appear on public websites.\nZillow has stated that properties marketed privately are barred from its website, but the company might not be rigorously enforcing this rule in San Antonio.\nTexas doesn\u2019t require sale price disclosure, so sellers in areas with high property taxes\noften prefer private deals\nas a way to hide the true value of the home from local appraisers.\nZillow\u2019s listing standard\n, implemented earlier this year, only allows properties that have been entered in the MLS within a day of public marketing. The company\u2019s stated goal is to make every listing visible to all buyers, mirroring NAR\u2019s\nClear Cooperation Policy\n.\nZillow warned Chicago\u2019s MLS that its private network breaches this standard. However, Zillow declined to enforce its policy in Chicago, so properties formerly listed on MRED\u2019s Private Listing Network can still appear on Zillow.\nSan Antonio may be enjoying some immunity as well.\nWhen asked if Zillow is enforcing its private listing ban in San Antonio, Zillow spokesperson Hadley Stecker said that the company\u2019s standards \u201chave been live in San Antonio since the summer.\u201d\nSome agents haven\u2019t noticed, including Grant Lopez, president of Keller Williams Heritage, one of the largest brokerages in San Antonio.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard of any enforcement,\u201d said Lopez, who added that he marketed his own home privately earlier this year before selling it.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I would say they\u2019re not enforcing it, other than \u2014 from the get-go, I thought it was going to be hard for them to track it. I was wondering, how the hell are they going to track if something\u2019s off market and then later goes on market and is in Zillow?\u201d\nZillow is \u201ctracking listing violations in a variety of ways, ranging from programmatic methods to manual listing monitoring,\u201d communications director Hadley Stecker said.\nThe San Antonio Board of Realtors is working with Zillow to nail down its stance toward the private listing database, spokesperson Taylor Fellows said.\n\u201cWe were notified of a couple of violations from some of our agents, so we\u2019re in the process of working with Zillow to get some clarity because of what the rules look like,\u201d Fellows said.\nFellows said he doesn\u2019t know whether Zillow is temporarily allowing privately marketed listings.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Fellows said. \u201cI don\u2019t have the exact details on the violation and what all it did entail, but that\u2019s why we\u2019ve reached out to Zillow, and we\u2019re trying to clarify and resolve so we better understand.\u201d\n",

The building, rising at 2120 Post Oak Boulevard in the Galleria district, promises \u201ctimeless architecture\u201d and a level of hospitality the developers say Houston hasn\u2019t seen before.\nDesigned by Pickard Chilton with Ziegler Cooper as architect of record, the 44-story tower is expected to climb more than 600 feet, with interiors by Houston-based Rottet Studio. The program pairs 156 hotel rooms and 114 residences.\nThe project revived a delayed proposal from Deiso Moss for a 43-story mixed-use tower on the same site.

A hearing to confirm the auction results is scheduled for early January.

        "content": "The Riviera Beach Community Redevelopment Agency will negotiate the sale of 2.2 acres near the waterfront to Peter Baytarian\u2019s Forest Development to build a mixed-use project.\nRiviera Beach council members, sitting as the city\u2019s CRA\u2019s board of commissioners, approved the deal with North Palm Beach-based Forest Development by a vote of 3 to 2 Wednesday evening, after hearing proposals from five development teams. Council Chairperson Shirley Lanier and Vice Chair KaShamba Miller-Anderson cast the dissenting votes.\nWayne Richards, Forest Development\u2019s attorney, told council members that Baytarian was eager to build a $325 million project at 1851 Broadway with 350 to 450 apartments, including 20 as workforce housing. The project would also include 17,000 square feet of retail and would break ground within 18 months of site plan approval.\n\u201cWhen I asked him about timing, he said \u2018full speed ahead.\u2019 He wants to hit this market while it\u2019s hot,\u201d Richards said.\nBaytarian told council members he was also willing to increase his current bid of $3.78 million to acquire land owned by the city and the CRA.\nShould Baytarian move forward, this would be his third project along the Broadway/U.S. 1 corridor. Richards said Forest Development is just days away from getting a certificate of occupancy for a pair of 24-story condo towers called\nNautilus 220\nin neighboring Lake Park, and months away from \u201csignificant movement\u201d at\nOculina\n, a planned 25-story dual condo tower project at 3700 Broadway.\nBaytarian\u2019s Forest Development made an unsolicited offer to acquire the 2.2-acre Riviera Beach parcel more than two years ago. In response, the city put out a request for proposals\nfrom other developers\ninterested in acquiring the property at 1851 Broadway for development.\nForest Development\u2019s proposal received the highest score from a selection committee of city administrators, despite having the lowest cash bid. That\u2019s because purchase price counted for just 15 percent of the selection committee\u2019s total scoring, while categories dealing with the project\u2019s design, community benefit package, and developer reputation each carried 20 percent, a CRA document explained.\nAccording to LaTonya Ammons, Riviera Beach\u2019s director of purchasing, if talks with Forest Development fall apart, the city could negotiate with the second-place contender, Washington, D.C.-based Frontier Development &amp; Hospitality Group and Deerfield Beach-based Gedeon Financial. Frontier and Gedeon proposed building 12,500 square feet of retail and 300 apartments with 75 percent of units reserved for workforce housing. Their bid included paying $4 million for the land. Woody Victor, senior vice president of Frontier Development, told council members his team was considering using the state\u2019s Live Local Act to gain extra density and, possibly, property tax abatements.\nThird-place contender, West Palm Beach-based\u00a0 Kenco Communities, had the highest cash bid of more than $4.55 million. It proposed building an eight-story building with 219 residential units, with up to 22 units for workforce housing.\nComing in fourth place was New York-based Coltown Properties, which proposed a project with 450 apartments. Its initial bid offered $4 million to the city, plus another $400,000 for the CRA for community enhancements. However, founding principal Steven Neuman told council members that Coltown was willing to pay at least $100,000 more than the highest bidder.\nThe last ranked contender was Palm Beach Gardens-based Elysium Land Development, headed by Eliott Johnson. Rather than buy the land, Johnson proposed forming a partnership with the city and other organizations to build a \u201ccommunity incubator\u201d that would include 106 affordable housing units.\nCouncil members initially planned to hear presentations from just\nthe top three ranked proposals\n. However, by a vote of 4 to 1 (councilman Glen Spirits dissenting) opted to hear all five proposals, partly because CRA Executive Director Gedel Merzius admitted he made a mistake when he told council members that Forest Development was the highest bidder during the CRA\u2019s Oct. 22 meeting.Riviera Beach officials have sought to attract development to expand their city\u2019s tax base to pay for infrastructure improvements such as a $400 million reconstruction of the city\u2019s defunct water plant. According to an analysis by\nThe Real Deal\n, nearly 2,000 condos and apartments are in\nRiviera Beach\u2019s residential development pipeline\n.",

The mention of \u201cnearly impossible\u201d suggests Mamdani may still find a way to get a housing project done there.\nBut Adams made that significantly more challenging last week when he designated the site as parkland and transferred ownership of the lot to the Parks Department. City Hall said the conversion, announced in the waning months of Adams\u2019 time in office, has been in the works since June.\nThe state Legislature would need to act for the land to be developed following the designation.\nMamdani was in good company as a critic of the designation. Gov. Kathy Hochul said Wednesday she would pursue parkland alienation for the site to \u201cundo this pathetic, lame-duck move.\u201d\n\u201cWith this disgraceful final act, the Adams administration is once again prioritizing elite comfort over affordable homes for vulnerable elderly people,\u201d Open New York chief of staff Andrew Fine said in a statement.\nAs of May,\nAdams supported the affordable living project\nslated to bring 123 units of senior housing to the site, but held off evicting the garden while First Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro was \u201creviewing\u201d the project.\nBut the administration\ncanceled\nplans in June, instead touting an agreement with Councilmember Chris Marte to rezone three other sites that would net 620 affordable units. Two of those sites, however, still lack attached developers, making it far from certain those projects will ever be built.\nThe canceled project involved a development partnership of Habitat for Humanity\u2019s regional affiliate, Pennrose and RiseBoro Community Partnership, which needed to overcome numerous legal obstacles to construct Haven Green, only to be foiled anyway.\n\u201cI think what they did undermines\nwhat the City of Yes\nis all about,\u201d Sabrina Lippman, CEO of Habitat for Humanity\u2019s regional affiliate, told Crain\u2019s\nafter the project cancellation\n. \u201cAnd it sets a really dangerous precedent for other affordable housing developers.\u201d\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner",

        "content": "After several lawsuits tried and failed to overturn New York\u2019s\nrent-stabilization law\n, a new complaint is taking a different approach.\nThe lawsuit, filed by the Small Property Owners of New York and a few individual landlords, takes aim at how the state law applies to vacant apartments. The complaint alleges that capping rents on vacant units violates the takings clause in the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution because it \u201cdirectly takes from the value of the apartment\u2019s leasehold.\u201d\nThat, the\nlawsuit\nalleges, results \u201ceither in a complete taking (by making it economically impossible to rent the leasehold) or a partial taking of the leasehold\u2019s value.\u201d\nAttorneys for the landlord said that, unlike previous lawsuits challenging the state\u2019s rent law, this complaint would not disrupt existing tenants. They hope this will help the case succeed where its\npredecessors\nhave failed.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not challenging the government\u2019s ability to protect existing tenants,\u201d said Robert Johnson, an attorney with the\nlibertarian-leaning\nnonprofit Institute for Justice, which is representing the plaintiffs pro bono. \u201cWhen an apartment is vacant, there is no tenant to protect, and it doesn\u2019t help anybody to have these units sit off the market.\u201d\nThe lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Manhattan this week, seeks to halt the application of rent stabilization rules on vacant apartments and calls for damages equal to the income lost by rent limitations on such apartments. The case names the city, the Rent Guidelines Board, the state and the Division of Homes and Community Renewal as defendants.\nThe complaint follows several other legal challenges to the state\u2019s rent law in recent years, including\none\nfiled by the Rent Stabilization Association and the Community Housing Improvement program, two groups that have since\nmerged\nto form the New York Apartment Association. Those groups, as well as plaintiffs in at least four other lawsuits targeting the law, tried to take their cases to the U.S. Supreme Court, which repeatedly\ndeclined\nto take up the issue.\n\u201cFor over 50 years, rent stabilization laws have kept rents affordable for millions of New York families, and state and federal courts have repeatedly upheld these laws, including as recently as\nlast year\n,\u201d a City Hall spokesperson said in a statement.\nEllen Davidson, an attorney with the Legal Aid Society, which intervened in the previous rent law cases on behalf of tenants and plans to do so in this lawsuit, said the latest case rehashes the arguments of the previous lawsuits, albeit with a focus on a subset of apartments.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same thing with new wrapping paper,\u201d she said.\nSimilar to SPONY\u2019s suit, previous cases also alleged violations of both the takings and due process clauses in the 14th Amendment. The latest case also claims that the law defies the privileges and immunities clause, which \u201cprotects their right to take, hold, and dispose of property,\u201d and the equal protections clause, \u201cbecause the owners of some vacant apartments are free to rent at market rates, while others are subject to crushing limitations.\u201d\n\u201cKeeping apartments empty is not the business model of small property owners,\u201d Ann Korchak, board president of SPONY, said in a statement. She said owners who can\u2019t raise the rents to levels that would help pay for necessary renovations are essentially forced to keep the units off the market.\nThe lawsuit describes different vacant apartments at 81 Cabrini Boulevard, a 30-unit building in Hudson Heights owned by brothers Pashko and Tony Lulgjuraj, who are plaintiffs in the case through an operating entity, RPN Management.\nThe brothers are keeping two of the building\u2019s apartments vacant \u201cbecause the regulated rent is so low that it does not make sense to put the units on the market,\u201d according to the lawsuit. The legal rent for one of those units is $710 per month, while an identical apartment the floor below (also stabilized) is renting for $2,595.\nThe second vacant unit has a legal rent of $860 per month, while a similar regulated apartment on the floor above it is being rented out for $3,000. The owners estimate that bringing the vacant units up to code would cost more than $100,000 per unit.\nAn entity tied to Bipin Mathew, which owns a six-unit building at 1819 Cornelia Street in Ridgewood, Queens, and an LLC tied to Ilan Rabinovitch, which owns a four-unit building at 135 West 78th Street, are also listed as plaintiffs in the lawsuit.\nBefore the\npassage\nof the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, landlords could increase rents on stabilized apartments in more ways. They could also deregulate apartments when they became vacant if rents reached a certain threshold. Davidson of the Legal Aid Society said returning the ability of landlords to deregulate vacant apartments would incentivize owners to drive tenants out of stabilized apartments.\n\u201cOur experience with pre-2019 rules is that anyone who lived in their apartment for more than 10 years had a target on their back,\u201d she said.\nLandlord groups have also\ntried\nto convince the state legislature to allow one-time rent resets for apartments that are vacated after a long tenancy, but lawmakers have shown little appetite for such changes. The state budget\nlast year\n, however, increased the amount that owners can increase rents after renovating stabilized apartments, but landlord groups argue that the change barely makes a dent in the capital needs for these buildings.\nIn an interview, plaintiff Pashko Lulgjuraj said he is hopeful that the SPONY lawsuit\u2019s approach will succeed.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking to bring down rent stabilization as we know it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is very narrow, very focused.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The\nLos Angeles City Council\nis cutting back on rent increases for\nrent-stabilized\napartments.\nOn Wednesday, the City Council voted 12\u20132 to approve changes to the city\u2019s Rent Stabilization Ordinance that affects about 624,000 residential units built on or before Oct. 1, 1978, Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The changes for the year from July 1, 2025 to June 30, 2026 call for a 1 percent floor and 4 percent ceiling on annual rent increases for these properties.\nUnder current regulations, landlords with units subject to the current rent stabilization guidelines are permitted to increase rent by either up to 8 percent or 3 percent plus the annual percentage change in the consumer price index in the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim area, whichever is lower.\nAbout 624,000 units across 118,000 properties are subject to the RSO, per\nL.A. Housing Department\ndata cited by Commercial Observer. More than half of renters in Los Angeles spend more than 30 percent of their monthly income on rent.\nThe proposal could keep some renters with tight budgets in their homes.\n\u201cWhat is happening, and I\u2019m seeing it among constituents, is that they\u2019re looking at the landscape of economic insecurity ahead\u2026 and they\u2019re choosing not to bet on L.A. anymore. And when our people leave, we lose what is best about L.A.,\u201d\nCouncilmember Nithya Raman\n, who proposed the changes, said ahead of the council\u2019s vote. \u201cOur affordability crisis is making L.A. less resilient and is making it less possible for people to live here.\u201d\nSo-called \u201cmom and pop\u201d landlords with smaller properties will be especially affected after dealing with pandemic-era rent freezes and the post-wildfire rent moratorium. Those owners of properties with two to 10 units will receive support for repairs and rehabilitation, Los Angeles Magazine\nreported\n. The changes could stand in the way of apartment owners keeping up with maintenance costs, opponents of the bill say. Developers might also shy away from proposing new multifamily projects.\n\u201cWe always argue that we don\u2019t want more corporate ownership [of residences]. What we\u2019re driving by doing these policies is for that to increase in the city of L.A.,\u201d Councilmember John Lee, who voted against the change, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be the cause of why people are not building here, because they can see that with a stroke of the pen, [the] council can do whatever it wants\u2026 This is just another example of how we\u2019re going to disincentivize building here in the City of L.A. and push more ownership into corporate ownership.\u201d\nThe rent stabilization changes expire next summer.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Gov. JB Pritzker is reviving his campaign to put homeowners\u2019 insurance rates under state scrutiny, weeks after a rate-review bill unexpectedly collapsed in the Illinois House.\nThe governor is leaning on a familiar example \u2014 State Farm\u2019s more than 27 percent spike in home insurance premiums this summer \u2014 to argue that Illinois is an outlier in leaving insurers unchecked, as homeowners shoulder some of the steepest increases in years, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nHomeowners insurance rates are ballooning across the country. But Illinois\u2019 home insurance premiums increased by\n50 percent\nbetween 2021 and 2024, the second-highest increase in the U.S.\nIllinois\u2019 regulatory void has become a political liability.\nPritzker\n, speaking Thursday in Chicago, framed the\nState Farm hike\nas exactly the kind of move that should trigger state oversight. The Bloomington-based giant blamed extreme weather and rising repair costs, but the governor said that explanation wasn\u2019t enough.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if homeowners are being gouged,\u201d he said, adding that a nearly 30 percent jump \u201cought to be reviewed by a state regulator.\u201d\nThe stalled bill would have allowed the Illinois Department of Insurance to vet and challenge rate increases deemed excessive or \u201cunfairly discriminatory.\u201d\nIt cleared the Senate 41-15 \u2014 with a small handful of Republicans joining Democrats \u2014 but fell four votes short in the House as the fall session closed. Several Democrats broke ranks, delivering Pritzker one of his few legislative setbacks in a chamber firmly controlled by his party.\nThe defeat was surprising given the public pressure campaign from Pritzker and legislative leaders.\nIn July, the governor co-authored an op-ed with\nHouse Speaker Emanuel \u201cChris\u201d Welch\nand Senate President Don Harmon urging State Farm to be more transparent. Welch\u2019s office told the outlet that leadership believed they had the votes, but \u201ca few people must have changed their minds after debate.\u201d\nOne of the Democratic holdouts was Rep. Thaddeus Jones, chair of the House Insurance Committee and mayor of Calumet City, who argued the bill ignored auto insurance \u2014 a bigger pain point for consumers, he said.\nJones didn\u2019t vote \u201cno\u201d but encouraged colleagues to tank the measure, calling for a more comprehensive overhaul. Campaign disclosures show he received about $20,000 in contributions from insurance interests this year, including $4,000 from a State Farm-aligned PAC, a common dynamic for committee chairs overseeing major industries.\nThe veto-session version of the bill had been scaled back from earlier drafts that paired oversight of home and auto coverage. It also would have required insurers to warn policyholders and state regulators 60 days before any premium increase above 10 percent. House Majority Leader Robyn Gabel, the bill\u2019s lead sponsor, said that window would give homeowners a realistic chance to shop for alternatives.\nState Farm countered that more oversight would backfire by making the market less competitive. The company cited inflation, costly weather events and major wildfire losses outside Illinois. It said it paid out $1.26 for every $1 of homeowner premium collected in the state last year, including $638 million in hail damage alone.\nRepublicans framed the proposal as overreach. Rep. Jeff Keicher, a State Farm agent, said it would \u201cturn the industry on its head\u201d without addressing litigation and other cost drivers.\nHarmon said Thursday he expects the House to take another run at the bill this spring.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The Goel entity then secured a $28 million loan for the property from Timberlake Mortgage.\nGoel applied to build 314 apartments with 7,100 square feet of retail space at the corner of Main and A streets. Nineteen of the units were to be set aside for\nlow-income and very-low-income income\nresidents.\nHayward officials approved the project in 2022, lauded as a development to increase housing supply, but construction never started.\nThe City of Hayward is mandated by the state to plan for 4,624 total new housing units by 2031 as part of its\nhousing element\n.\nOther housing developments in the pipeline in Hayward include a four-story, 30-unit complex proposed by Zibasara. That project was\napproved\nlast year for a 1-acre site at 22422 Rockaway Lane.\nEarlier this month, Namdar Realty Group\nbought the Southland Mall\nin Hayward from\nBrookfield Properties\nfor $70 million cash. The purchase price worked out to $64 per square foot for the 1.1 million-square-foot retail complex anchored by Macy\u2019s, JCPenney, Ross Dress for Less, Hobby Lobby and Cinemark.\nHouston-based Goel took a spin in the Chicago multifamily market\u2019s wild ride to recovery recently. The landlord was struggling to turn a profit on a\nhigh-interest, $130 million loan from MF1\nahead of its May 2024 maturity. But Goel landed $130 million refinancing from Bridge Investment Group in July for the property, at 500 Station Boulevard in Aurora, as Chicago\u2019s market bounced back.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Anthropic is diving deeper into the data center development game.\nThe company has laid out a $50 billion plan to build its own AI campuses across the United States, Bloomberg\nreported\n. The move underscores how quickly tech giants are swallowing land and power in pursuit of computational heft.\nThe OpenAI rival detailed the build-out this week; the first sites are expected to come online next year. Unlike its past reliance on cloud titans Amazon and Google, Anthropic is taking the lead on this round of infrastructure, partnering with U.K.-based \u201cneocloud\u201d startup Fluidstack to deliver gigawatts of capacity.\nAnthropic framed the spending as aligned with the Trump administration\u2019s pitch for \u201cAmerican AI leadership,\u201d and it comes with the usual jobs pledge: roughly 2,400 construction roles and 800 permanent positions across future campuses in markets including Texas and New York.\nCEO Dario Amodei cast the expansion as table stakes for accelerating scientific breakthroughs and building \u201cmore capable AI systems.\u201d\nThe plan vaults Anthropic into the same arena as its larger competitors, all of which are racing to secure land, power and political goodwill.\nEarlier this year, OpenAI floated a $500 billion U.S. data center program known as Stargate before\nexpanding it abroad\n. Meta, meanwhile, is pushing a 2-gigawatt\nLouisiana facility\nand recently telegraphed plans to deploy $600 billion in domestic infrastructure over the next several years.\nGoogle, Microsoft and Nvidia are running similar plays, stirring investor questions about whether the industry is scaling faster than its revenue models can justify.\nThose doubts haven\u2019t slowed the capital pouring into AI development. Anthropic \u2014 founded in 2021 by former OpenAI staffers \u2014 raised $13 billion this year at a $183 billion valuation and now counts about 300,000 business users of its Claude model.\nTwo months ago, the company leased several floors of office space at the Foundry Square III building in downtown San Francisco, totaling\n100,000 square feet\n. Anthropic had already subleased more than 230,000 square feet across the street from Slack.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Tequila scion Juan Beckmann Vidal appears to have weighed an ambitious exit from 432 Park Avenue, the poster tower of Billionaires\u2019 Row\u2019s boom and bust.\nThe Jose Cuervo owner recently listed his three-bedroom condominium for $90 million before the offering was abruptly pulled this week, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. The listing vanished after the Journal asked questions about the unit\u2019s ownership.\nVidal couldn\u2019t be reached for comment, and it\u2019s unclear whether he still plans to try his luck in a building where luck has been in short supply.\nThe tower has been plagued with drama related to its defects, laid bare in 2021 litigation. This battle has continued to drag on prices and turnover. Nine units are publicly listed, all discounted from their original asks, StreetEasy data shows. One six-bedroom unit on the 71st floor is seeking $32 million after trading for nearly $35 million in 2018.\nVidal\u2019s unit isn\u2019t the typical stark-white, sky-high minimalism that made 432 Park famous. Instead, he tapped Mexican architect Jorge Loyzaga and design firm Redd Kaihoi to build out a classical European fantasia: boiserie walls crafted by artisans in Mexico, tented ceilings, frescoes, heavy drapery and chandeliers.\nFurnishings available for an additional cost reportedly included an antique Persian Mahal rug and a bookcase by French designer Henri Samuel.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Richard Nassimi and Sotheby International Realty\u2019s Mercedes Menocal Gregoire were set to market the unit.\nVidal bought in during the frothier days of 2017,\npaying $44.6 million\nthrough an entity tied to his family. But the relationship soured early. Before closing, Vidal\nsued\nthe developers \u2014 a partnership between CIM Group and Harry Macklowe \u2014 alleging a burst water pipe flooded and damaged the apartment and that the developers refused to repair it to his satisfaction.\nHis complaint was dropped months later, but it foreshadowed the wave of claims that followed. The condo board accused developers of cutting corners and ignoring risks, prompting the developers to counter that the board created a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d that unfairly maligned the project.\nA New York Times investigation recently added\noxygen\n, reporting that exterior cracking is so extensive the building could eventually become uninhabitable unless significant fixes are made.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Citing negative impacts from climate change, Miami-Dade officials may grant a rent break to a politically connected restaurant tenant leasing a county owned waterfront venue.\nHammock Marine Corporation \u2014 a company owned by\nRodney Barreto\n, chairman of the Florida Fish &amp; Wildlife Commission, and Brian May, a lobbyist for several big name developers including billionaires\nKen Griffin\nand\nSteve Ross\n\u2014 owns and operates Noma Beach at Redfish Grill, as well as a bait and tackle shop, at Matheson Hammock Park at 9610 Old Cutler Road in Coral Gables.\nHammock Marine leases the land underneath Noma Beach and the bait and tackle shop from the county for a base monthly rent of $4,500, plus 8 percent of monthly gross receipts, county records show.\nThe county commission\u2019s appropriations committee on Thursday was set to vote on a resolution to no longer require Hammock Marine to pay 8 percent of monthly gross receipts.\nAccording to the resolution, Hammock Marine\u2019s \u201coperations are routinely adversely impacted by a variety of unpredictable factors such as king tides and flooded parking lots.\u201d Eliminating the percentage rent requirement would \u201coffer relief to [Hammock Marine] from the impact of the unpredictable factors,\u201d the resolution states.\nHowever, the legislation was withdrawn by its sponsor, county commissioner\nRaquel Regalado\n, whose district includes Matheson Hammock Park. In a text message, Regalado said the resolution \u201cneeds more work.\u201d She did not provide further comment.\nBarreto did not respond to requests for comment, and May declined to comment.\nThe duo bought Hammock Marine from its previous owner, Charles Hauser, shortly after Hurricane Irma hit South Florida in 2017, state corporate records show. The storm caused extensive damage to the restaurant, at the time known as Redfish Grill, as well as the bait and tackle shop. Hammock Marine\u2019s lease with the county dates back to 1992, according to county documents.\nWhen the county commission approved a lease amendment in 2018, Hammock Marine did not have to pay rent for two years while the company repaired and renovated the restaurant and bait and tackle shop.\nThe spots reopened in 2020 and two years later, Hammock Marine partnered with Italian chef Donatella Arpaia to open Noma Beach at Redfish Grill, a seafood restaurant that has three dollar signs and a 3.3 star rating on Yelp. Appetizers include\u00a0 a charcuterie board for $42; salads priced between $25 to $37; fish dishes priced between $50 to $57 and pasta dishes priced from $37 to $58.\nAccording to a source familiar with the lease negotiations, the restaurant is struggling, and Hammock Marine\u2019s owners and county staff are in dispute about the monthly revenue threshold that would require the percentage rent to kick in. The source said both sides may negotiate an agreement that provides Hammock Marine with a rent credit based on the percentage of the gross receipts the company has already paid Miami-Dade. If that happens, Regalado\u2019s resolution would not come back for a county commission vote, the source said.\nBarreto\n, a developer who is also a lobbyist, and May have long political ties at County Hall. In the 1990s, the pair aligned themselves with then-Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas, fundraising for his successful campaigns. Both men also raised campaign cash for numerous elected officials who have been county commissioners throughout the years.\nFor the past 13 years, Barreto has served as chairman of the Florida Fish &amp; Wildlife Commission. He was reappointed to the post by three governors, most recently by Gov. Ron DeSantis. In addition to Griffin and Ross,\nMay\u2019s client roster\nalso includes 13th Floor Investments, Related Group, Terra, Hyatt Hotel Corporation and Coconut Grove-based Grass River Properties.",

Ravi bought the penthouse in 2021 for $6 million. He originally planned to spend approximately $4 million on updating the residence but ran into hurdles like one million pounds of debris in the walls that needed removal and uneven concrete floors, leading to the budget \u201cfar exceeding\u201d original expectations, Ravi told Mansion Global.\nThe renovation endeavor at the 5,180-square-foot residence was completed last December.\n\u201cThe upside of all the work is I got exactly what I wanted,\u201d Ravi said. The 10th-floor penthouse is one of two units in the building that take up an entire floor. \u201cThe views are spectacular \u2014 everything from the Golden Gate Bridge to Alcatraz, the Salesforce Tower and the\nTransamerica building\nto the Bay Bridge and out to the ocean to the west,\u201d Ravi said.\nThe penthouse is on the top floor of the building, which allowed Ravi to raise the ceilings up to 11 feet. The apartment has three bedrooms and three and a half bathrooms, as well as a dressing room and one bathroom with heated marble floors. A home office, gym and breakfast nook are also available to a buyer.\nPacific Heights has seen a number of high-ticket sales in recent months.\nLast month, a mansion on the neighborhood\u2019s famed Billionaires\u2019 Row\nsold for $42 million\n, making it the priciest sale in San Francisco this year. In August, a Pac Heights mansion featured in this year\u2019s\nSan Francisco Decorator Showcase\nsold for $16.2 million. And in May, a home at\n2750 Vallejo Street sold\nfor $20.6 million, down from a 2023 sale price of $23.5 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Two Austin Community College parcels could be folded in later, giving future bidders room to shape a sizable development.\nThe plan makes Lockhart the latest satellite community in Austin\u2019s orbit to establish or redevelop downtowns before private projects leapfrog ahead of them.\nSan Antonio-based TBA Douglas is leading community engagement, with feedback set to feed into requests for proposals. Development teams will be asked to submit concepts for a district that balances Lockhart\u2019s small-town character with newfound economic momentum.\nMayor Lew White cast the initiative as a chance to define the city\u2019s future rather than react to it.\nThe city plans to\npost materials\nand updates online as planning advances.\nAustin\u2019s suburban boom has already reshaped places like Georgetown, Kyle and Hutto. Lockhart \u2014 famed for smoked meat but increasingly on developers\u2019 radar \u2014 is a town of about 15,000 residents, according to the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 5-year estimates.\nPerry Homes started construction on\nJuniper Springs\nthis summer, a 400-acre master-planned development in Lockhart, which is expected to include 1,400 homes.\nA few miles north of Lockhart, along State Highway 130 in Mustang Ridge, is where plans are rolling out for a $1.5 billion, 211-acre master-planned community called\nPura Vida\n. The Austin-based SonWest Company project includes a potential surf park.\nLockhart\u2019s reputation rests on barbecue royalty \u2014 Kreuz Market, Smitty\u2019s Market and The Original Black\u2019s BBQ \u2014 but newcomers like Barbs B Q and Terry Black\u2019s are even diversifying the low-and-slow market.\nManufacturers tied to food production have planted flags, including Larry Ellison-backed Sensei Farms, pickling outfit Hill Country Foodworks and frozen treat maker Ziegenfelder.\nRelated Companies\u2019 cold-storage arm\nRealCold\nis also building a major facility, as Lockhart\u2019s industrial corridor grows.\nOther industrial and technology-driven developments are in the works as well. Ashton Gray and\nEarthship\nreceived approval in August to build a \u201cproto-town innovation hub\u201d on 538 acres at 1307 Westwood Road, just outside of Lockhart. The project is described as a manufacturing company town, aiming to create a work-life ecosystem around advanced manufacturing, robotics, space and energy research.\nEarlier this year, Denver-based developer\nTract\nacquired more than 1,500 acres in Caldwell County just outside of Lockhart, with plans for a data center campus.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The numbers reveal a diversifying sector proliferating throughout global markets, expanding outward from its American origins.\nA similar report published in September by\nKnight Frank\nfound that the Middle East accounts for 15.9 percent of active branded residences globally, and 26.7 percent of all pipeline projects. Combined, U.S. markets make up 32.7 percent of branded residences, and 26.2 percent of pipeline projects, the report showed.\nThe branded residences sector has exploded in recent years, fueled by ballooning wealth and a pandemic-catalyzed real estate boom. According to the Savills report, there were just 323 branded residences in 2015, a figure that has nearly tripled to 910 as of this year.\nDevelopers are drawn to the branded residence model as a mode of attracting and building trust with buyers, who in turn pay a premium for the logo on the door. Globally, branded residences command an average 33 percent premium, the report found.\nFollowing Dubai and Miami in branded market rankings were New York, with 32 completed projects and four projects in the pipeline, S\u00e3o Paulo with 15 completed projects and 15 in the pipeline, and Cairo with two completed projects and 26 in the pipeline.\nThe report also identified the hospitality groups leading the market with the most branded projects. Marriott dominated with more than 300 branded residences globally. Marriott, which is the parent company for\nRitz-Carlton\n,\nSt. Regis Hotels &amp; Resorts\n,\nW Hotels\nand\nEdition\n, has numerous branded projects in South Florida, alone. Following Marriott are Accor, Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts, Banyan Group and Hyatt Hotels &amp; Resorts.\nThe report also identified the growing share of non-hotel brands in the branded residence sector. It has expanded to include design houses like\nDolce &amp; Gabbana\n, car brands like\nPagani\nand\nBentley\n, and big names in dining like\nMajor Food Group\n, best known for its Italian restaurant chain Carbone. At\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nMiami Real Estate Forum earlier this month, developer Carlos Rosso discussed the danger of stretching the relationship between brands and condominiums, pointing to non-hospitality brands.\n\u201cA brand helps us sell because we don\u2019t have to explain [what we\u2019re selling],\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to be careful not to exaggerate the concept of branding.\u201d",

The building was built in 2000, less than a block away from the beach and the Worth Avenue clock tower.\nGriffin\u2019s other Palm Beach holdings include the adjacent office building at 125 Worth Avenue, which he bought for\n$83 million\nin 2023, and a 17.7-acre residential assemblage on South Ocean Boulevard that he spent\nat least $350 million\nto acquire. He is building a residential compound on the property that will include\na 20,000-plus-square-foot mansion for his mother\n.\nThe trade follows Palm Beach\u2019s last department store, Saks Fifth Avenue, closing its doors across the street at the Esplanade at 150 Worth Avenue in April. Records show O\u2019Connor Capital Partners bought the 2-acre complex for $104 million in 2014. In April, the firm announced plans to redevelop the 50,000-square-foot Saks space with design firm Fairfax &amp; Sammons Architecture, according to a press release.",

        "content": "A Miami-Dade County committee gave David Martin\u2019s Terra the green light to take over the troubled Miami Seaquarium in Virginia Key. Now the Coconut Grove-based firm will seek approval from the full county commission next month.\nOn Thursday, the Miami-Dade appropriations committee advanced Terra\u2019s proposal to acquire Miami Seaquarium\u2019s lease from the bankrupt company that owned the longtime attraction. A Terra affiliate is buying the lease and Miami Seaquarium for\n$22.5 million\n.\nA\nDelaware bankruptcy court\napproved the deal, but it needs the county\u2019s approval because Miami-Dade owns the property at 4400 Rickenbacker Causeway.\nMartin aims to reimagine the aging Virginia Key landmark into a vibrant waterfront destination. His plan entails a new marina, baywalk, retail and restaurant row, plus an accredited aquarium that will not house any marine mammals.\n\u201cOur team is excited to advance on a plan that will see at least $100 million invested in restoring the site as a destination for locals and visitors,\u201d Martin said in a statement. \u201cThe redeveloped seaquarium will also generate significant community benefits, including more than $750 million in revenue for the county and hundreds of jobs.\u201d\nThe appropriations committee\u2019s vote was a key step in reshaping the fate of the 38-acre property, said county commissioner Raquel Regalado, whose district includes\nMiami Seaquarium\nand who is the county\u2019s representative in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy case by the current owner, MS Leisure Company.\n\u201cWe really wanted to send a clear message to the bankruptcy court that we are moving forward,\u201d Regalado said at the committee meeting. \u201cWe can\u2019t move the marine mammals until we get the green light from the county commissioners.\u201d\nTerra\nintends to modernize the site by adding new event spaces in the iconic Buckminster Fuller dome, a fisherman\u2019s village, wellness facilities and a conservation research center.\nThe county\u2019s involvement was triggered after MS Leisure Company \u2014 a subsidiary of The Dolphin Company \u2014 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April. Miami-Dade first threatened eviction in 2023, alleging the operator violated animal welfare laws and failed to maintain Miami Seaquarium. The same year, the death of Tokitae, better known as Lolita the orca, intensified public scrutiny. Last year, county officials followed through on their threat and filed an eviction lawsuit against\nMS Leisure Company.",

        "content": "Tiffany &amp; Co. is gearing up for a major glow-up on Rodeo Drive, securing city approval to swap a dormant five-story building with a sleek new flagship.\nThe Beverly Hills Planning Commission on Thursday approved plans from Bernard Arnault\u2019s luxury conglomerate, LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, for a new\nTiffany &amp; Co. flagship\nat 360 North Rodeo Drive. The approval allows the company to move ahead with permit applications.\nPlans call for tearing down the 62,513-square-foot, five-story vacant building on site that had retail at the base of a four-story Luxe Rodeo Drive Hotel that\u2019s been closed since September 2020. In its place, LVMH will erect a 30,468-square-foot, three-story commercial building for TIffany &amp; Co., according to a\nPlanning Commission report\n.\nNew York City-based Peter Marino was tapped as the design architect, and Gruen Associates in Los Angeles is the architect of record. Marino designed the interior of the Tiffany &amp; Co. flagship store in New York City, which is the only one of the brand\u2019s retail stores in the U.S. bigger than the one planned for 360 North Rodeo Drive. Gruen designed the Ralph Lauren boutique at 444 North Rodeo Drive.\nLVMH\npreviously submitted plans\nto build a large new Louis Vuitton store and adjacent campus designed by architect Frank Gehry, a project that\u2019s pending.\nThe company bought the 80-room Luxe Rodeo Drive Hotel that sits between Brighton and Dayton ways \u2014 the only hotel on the high-end street \u2014 in 2021 for $200 million.\nTopping out at 60 feet, including 15 feet for a rooftop structure and outdoor terrace, the new Tiffany &amp; Co. will be constructed out of anodized aluminum, polished nickel frame, tall glass walls, glass entry doors and metal awnings, per planning documents. Included will be an overhead skylight to illuminate the stairway from floors one to three, and outdoor terraces. On one side there will be a three-story atrium, which may be used to exhibit historical Tiffany jewelry, Sean Devine, vice president of store planning and construction for Tiffany &amp; Co., said at the Planning Commission meeting.\nOn top of two levels of retail, the third floor will be home to a restaurant with up to 53 seats, serving American French cuisine. The eatery, dubbed Blue Box Cafe, has \u201cnot yet been named,\u201d documents indicate.\nThe rooftop will have an outdoor terrace area reserved for invitation-only appointments and 60-person-maximum catered events for \u201cvery important clients,\u201d plans reveal. The rooftop will be outfitted with 1,252 square feet of ornamental landscaping.\nTiffany &amp; Co. will have a three-person valet service. On-site parking will include one level below grade for nine vehicles and a surface parking lot for five vehicles, which the company believes is sufficient on a daily basis. For big events, LVMH will make additional parking arrangements.\nConstruction is anticipated to take 28 months, with work expected to begin in February.\nOnce the flagship opens, LVMH will shutter its store at 210 North Rodeo Drive, Devine said.\n",

The asking price for the eight-bedroom home is $1,252 per square foot.\nThe seller is Mary McNaughton, beneficiary of a trust established for her and her late husband, Bill, longtime Hinsdale residents. The home was built in 2020 with a wall-of-glass fa\u00e7ade and European white oak finishes framing wide-open lake views.\nDemand at the high end in\nNew Buffalo\n, Michigan, roughly 71 miles from downtown Chicago, has been fierce. Three multimillion-dollar homes near the McNaughton property went under contract recently almost immediately after listing.\nThe home of former Illinois House GOP leader Lee Daniels, priced just under $7 million, found a buyer in\nsix days\nlast month. A lakefront property a few doors down on the coveted Marquette Drive listed at just below $7 million went under contract in three days.\nAn inland home on Prospect Drive overlooking the Galien River \u2014 the green-roofed retreat owned by\nMal\u00f6rt-maker\nTremaine Atkinson \u2014 listed at about $6 million in late August and was under contract within two weeks.

Interior photos show rough-hewn ceiling beams, crisp white finishes and a peak-roofed sitting room wrapped in glass. The trust paid $1.85 million for the site in 2019 and completed construction the following year.\nNew Buffalo\u2019s pricing ceiling rose last spring when another Marquette Drive property closed at $8.25 million, in the town\u2019s most-expensive sale of all time.

The Pleasanton Planning Commission voted to approve the project on Wednesday.\nThe developer first proposed the development in 2023. It submitted a preliminary application at the time under Senate Bill 330, which freezes development and zoning standards at the time of application submission. As part of the recently passed Assembly Bill 130, the project secured a\nCEQA exemption\nthat will allow it to progress more quickly.\nTrue Life\u2019s plan calls for demolishing a 22,000-square-foot office building to make way for 59 three-story condominium townhome units and seven accessory dwelling units. Of the new homes, nine will be deed-restricted affordable homes for lower-income tenants.\nThe site is within a housing opportunity zone in the city\u2019s\nhousing element\n. Pleasanton is mandated by the state to plan to build 5,965 new housing units by 2031.\nThe Black Avenue property is currently owned by the neighboring Quarry Lane School, a private school which has its Pleasanton West Campus location next door. Quarry Lane bought the site in 2020 from developer\nOverton Moore Properties\nfor $5.3 million; documents filed with the city in 2023 said the private school was interested in converting the property for residential use, according to the Business Times, though True Life said at the time wasn\u2019t working with the school on the project. The 4400 Black Avenue commercial building was built in the early 1970s and was once leased by AT&amp;T, though it\u2019s since moved out after the expiration of its lease.\nPleasanton was\nfound\nto be one of the cleanest cities in the country and earlier this year was\nranked\nthe number-two best city in the country for quality of life; coincidentally, nearby\nSan Ramon\nwas voted number one.\nElsewhere in the East Bay, last month,\nTrue Life filed an application\nto redevelop another commercial property. That proposal calls for building 300 residential units on the site of the Harbor Bay Landing shopping center.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Another unit sold to Keith and Sandra Moore in late July, according to county records.\n\u201cI\u2019m starting to see more of an uptick of out-of-town or out-of-state buyers that are used to the condo life, the high-rise, mid-rise lifestyle.

        "content": "New York City\u2019s luxury market has been on a hot streak \u2014 but only time will tell\nwhether that tear will survive Zohran Mamdani\nmoving into Gracie Mansion.\nEven as political spin swirled over what the 34-year-old Assembly member\u2019s successful campaign would bring, much of which\ncame from the industry itself\n, buyers with deep pockets\nkept snapping up some of the city\u2019s priciest properties\n.\n\u201cThere is absolutely no sign of a reckoning or discount or fear in the market,\u201d said Leslie Garfield\u2019s Matthew Lesser. \u201cThe reality is that we\u2019re seeing a lot of activity here.\u201d\nIn the two weeks leading up to the election, nearly 70 homes in Manhattan asking $4 million or more landed signed contracts, per Olshan Realty\u2019s weekly reports. In Brooklyn, a home in Gravesend owned by the Gindi real estate family\nset a new record\nin the borough when it sold for $32 million in late October.\nEven once the results were announced, the luxury market showed few signs of slowing down. Olshan reported\nanother banner week\nfor deals in Manhattan, with more than 40 inked deals for luxury properties \u2014 24 of which were signed after the results were announced on Nov. 4.\nLesser, who specializes in selling townhouses, said that most of the predictions about the incoming mayor \u2014 including theories about a so-called Mamdani discount \u2014 are all hype.\n\u201cNo one knows what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Lesser said. \u201cThings will slow down inevitably because of the holidays, but then you\u2019ll see reports saying, \u2018Oh wow, contracts are down. It\u2019s the Mamdani effect.\u201d\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Michelle Griffith echoed a similar refrain about the speculation, though she wasn\u2019t quick to dismiss the possibility of a \u201cMamdani discount.\u201d\nShe said it was likely too soon to tell whether fears over the mayor-elect had an impact on those sales, considering most of the reported activity has so far been about contracts signed, not done deals. She added that some of her seller clients, skittish over the results, are starting to accept offers they would have said no to just a few months ago.\n\u201cYes, there\u2019s movement,\u201d Griffith said. \u201cOnce those [deals] close, we might see that sellers had to be significantly more flexible and come off those asking prices.\u201d\nGriffith said that because Mamdani has focused much of his campaign on tenants\u2019 rights, some sellers who would have previously considered backing down from offers and renting their homes may opt to sell for a lower price instead.\n\u201cIf sellers don\u2019t get the right price, they may say, \u2018Maybe I\u2019ll rent this for a year or two and ride out the market,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat conversation is more complicated now.\u201d\nNot so fast\u2026\nGary Barnett is trying to offload one of the priciest units at Central Park Tower \u2014 again.\nThe developer this week re-listed a duplex at the Billionaires\u2019 Row tower, asking $128 million, after pulling it from the market in March, according to StreetEasy. The price tag is significantly less than the $150 million the Extell Development CEO had been seeking for it since he first put it on the market in 2021.\nThe condo, which spans the 127th and 128th floors, is the priciest home on the market in New York City, followed by a quadplex at 111 West 57th Street that\u2019s been asking $110 million since it was listed in April.\nCompass\u2019 Carl Gambino has the listing for the 11,500-square-foot apartment, which was previously represented by Shlomi Reuveni of Reuveni Development Market.\nNow that the duplex is back on the market, some may be wondering about the fate of the\nsupertall\u2019s crown jewel\npenthouse \u2014 a sprawling 17,500-square-foot triplex that was one of the main backdrops of Ryan Serhant\u2019s Netflix series, \u201cOwning Manhattan.\u201d\nThe pinnacle penthouse at 217 West 57th Street hit the market in 2022 asking a whopping $250 million, which would have broken the record for the priciest deal in the U.S. if it had sold for that price.\nHowever, a year later, Barnett\nslashed the price\non the penthouse to $195 million and chalked the move up to an effort to \u201cget serious about selling.\u201d\nBy the following summer, shortly after Serhant\u2019s show premiered on the streaming service, the developer pulled the penthouse off the market.\nIt has yet to resurface.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe priciest sale to land in the city register this week was a condo at Extell Development\u2019s Central Park Tower, which traded in an all-cash deal for\n$47.5 million\n, or $7,100 per square foot. The full-floor unit sold to an unknown buyer for significantly less than its last asking price of just under $55 million.\nUnit 121 spans 7,000 square feet and has five bedrooms and five bathrooms. It also features 11-foot-tall floor-to-ceiling windows, private foyer and an eat-in kitchen.\nSales at 217 West 57th Street are headed by an in-house team at Extell and another with Corcoran Sunshine, including Kane Manera, Janet Wang, Tim Rizzo and Gabriele Tonini.\n",

        "content": "\u201cHow would you feel about being called Peaches?\u201d\nThat\u2019s what Mary Ann Tighe asked MaryAnne Gilmartin after brokering Forest City Ratner\u2019s deal to develop The New York Times headquarters in 2000. The idea came mid-pitch, after Tighe realized Gilmartin\u2019s firm would get the job, meaning two women with the same name (different spellings) would be leading the project.\n\u201cI said to the assembled group, \u2018Oh no, we\u2019ll have two Mary Anns,\u2019\u201d Tighe recalled at a recent Commercial Real Estate Women (CREW) Network event. \u201cI\u2019ll always remember them looking at me in horror. I said maybe we should do what they do in hair salons \u2014 if you have a second identical name, you take a different one.\u201d\nTwo of the top women in commercial real estate sharing a name is rare. What\u2019s even rarer is how far they\u2019ve come. Both stumbled into the industry by chance, yet each carved a path to the top in a field dominated by men.\nTigue was 34 and had a glamorous job in television when she first heard the term \u2018commercial real estate.\u2019 She experienced a hard landing in brokerage, but with the guidance of mentors who showed her how to navigate the predominantly male environment, she began to rise. Her ascent never stopped.\nGilmartin\u2019s entry into real estate was similarly serendipitous. A professor suggested she apply for an urban fellowship, a unique opportunity to work with city agencies during Ed Koch\u2019s administration. She began managing complex projects, like negotiating with an 82-year-old squatter with four pit bulls and a shotgun over a site where the city wanted to build a police department tow pound.\n\u201cI solved his problem and I said to myself, \u2018if this is what real estate is about, it\u2019s about human relationships and connection, and I thought, \u2018this is sort of fun,\u2019\u201d Gilmartin said.\nTheir paths crossed years later, after Gilmartin cold-called Tighe and invited her to lunch at the Four Seasons. That eventually led to their partnership on the New York Times building, and ultimately a decades-long friendship and mentorship. Both women rose to the top of their field, Tighe as CEO of CBRE\u2019s Tri-State region and Gilmartin as founder and CEO of her own firm, MAG Partners.\nThis week, the ranks of women in the commercial real estate C-suite got smaller. Kathleen McCarthy Baldwin, global co-head of real estate at Blackstone, announced she will leave the firm at the end of the year. McCarthy Baldwin, one of the firm\u2019s highest-ranking female executives, joined Blackstone in 2010 and became COO three years later, eventually rising to global co-head of its $320 billion real estate business.\nWhat comes next for McCarthy Baldwin is unknown. She could take a senior role elsewhere or start her own venture. Her announcement comes at a time when women\u2019s representation in CRE leadership remains stubbornly low. Women comprise 38 percent of the CRE workforce and only about 9 percent of C\u2011suite positions, according to a recent CREW study. Only 31 percent of women under 40 say they aspire to a C-suite position, compared to 36 percent in 2020, signaling that the path to executive leadership remains unusually steep.\nThe number of women at the top could be shrinking, making trailblazers like Tighe, Gilmartin and McCarthy Baldwin all the more remarkable.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nSC Hospitality and East Gate Investors are partnering on a project to turn an old Eastern Athletic Club in Brooklyn Heights into an urban country club, per\nCurbed\n. They signed a 49-year lease for the entire 52,000-square-foot club space and plan to open\nKings Athletic Club\n, a racquet and wellness club that will have a pool, two tennis courts, a squash court, pickleball and golf simulators, along with wellness amenities and a bar and restaurant. Will more urban country clubs continue to pop up in the city, and is there a market for them? Send a note to\nelizabeth.cryan@therealdeal.com\nwith your thoughts.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nQueens native Joe Macken built a 50-by-30-foot model of New York City\u2019s five boroughs from his basement in Clifton Park, New York. He used an X-Acto knife, balsa wood, Styrofoam and Elmer\u2019s glue to carve nearly a million tiny buildings to scale. The model went viral after his daughter posted it on TikTok and will go on display in February at the\nMuseum of the City of New York\n. Take that, Bob Knakal!\nElsewhere\u2026\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced that a ride on the PATH train would rise to $4 \u2014 a 33 percent increase,\nThe New York Times\nreported. The fare hike would go into effect by early 2029 as part of a plan to improve service between Manhattan and northern New Jersey\nJPMorgan Chase has been billed $74 million in legal fees for Charlie Javice\u2019s criminal defense, following the startup founder\u2019s arrest for defrauding the bank, the\nWall Street Journal\nreported. Javice\u2019s legal expenses include luxury hotel upgrades, personal hygiene products like cellulite butter and lawyers who billed 24 hours in a single day. JPMorgan is attempting to overturn a judge\u2019s order requiring it to pick up the legal bills.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$28 million\nfor 18 East 71st Street. The Lenox Hill mansion is 13,000 square feet.\nCorcoran Group\u2019s\nAdam Schneider has the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$32 million\nfor 131-02 40th Street. Jade Century Properties\u2019\nXiaorong Zhai\nsold part of the mixed-use, 20-story complex in Flushing.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $30 million for 9 Jay Street. The Tribeca townhome is 8,200 square feet and listed by\nCompass\u2019\nThe Hudson Advisory Team.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 15,930-square-foot, five-story building with 29 residential units at 950 Glenmore Avenue in the East New York City Line area of Brooklyn.

        "content": "Bridge Logistics Properties is continuing its Southern California shopping spree with one of the biggest single-asset industrial deals in the region this year.\nIts Bridge Investment Group industrial entity bought a 1.1 million-square-foot warehouse at 10681 Production Avenue in Fontana for $174 million, Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The price works out to $158 per square foot.\nThe seller\u2019s identity was hidden behind an LLC.\nIt was one of the most-expensive transactions for an Inland Empire facility so far this year. The record is held by Burlington Distribution\u2019s purchase of a 900,000-square-foot Riverside distribution center\nfrom BlackRock\nin April for $257 million, or $286 per square foot.\nCubework, a flex industrial space provider, occupies the Bridge Logistics building, though the property is expected to become vacant in the first quarter of next year. Bridge plans to revamp the office space and dock loading wells.\n\u201cAssets of this scale, quality and location are scarce,\u201d Bridge Logistics managing director Paul Jones said. \u201cThe recovery in tenant demand for large, high-quality assets is outpacing available supply.\u201d\nBridge Logistics is looking to grow its holdings in Greater Los Angeles\u2019 industrial hotspots, and the latest acquisition adds to its collection in Fontana. In July, it\nbought three industrial buildings\nin the San Bernardino County enclave for $83.5 million; the deal for the 332,800-square-foot industrial portfolio included a 100,000-square-foot building at 14074 Rancho Court, a 57,650-square-foot building at 14019 Rose Avenue and a 175,100-square-foot building at 14928 Washington Drive.\nLast month, Bridge\npaid $109 million\nfor two adjacent warehouse properties in City of Industry. One building, at 18501 San Jose Avenue, spans 199,200 square feet and sold for $49 million, or $246 per square foot, and the other, at 18385 San Jose Avenue, spans 250,000 square feet and sold for $60 million, or $240 per square foot.\nThis week, Morgan Stanley Real Estate sought to get a piece of the Fontana pie. The banking giant\u2019s real estate investment arm\npurchased a 26-acre industrial outdoor storage parcel\nat 10650 Hemlock Avenue for $92 million, or $3.5 million per acre.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Plans for a large-scale development near the Southern Dallas campus of the University of North Texas at Dallas won a $23.5 million economic development grant from the City of Dallas.\nRussell Glen Company, led by\nTerrence Maiden\n, is behind the $47 million mixed-use development planned for a 90-acre tract at University Hills Boulevard and Camp Wisdom Road, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe project, called the Rivulet, calls for 300 single-family homes, 240 apartments and 20 acres of future retail \u2014 a program city officials hope will help fill longtime gaps in attainable housing and essential services.\nA grocery store and a public library are among the possible tenants, signaling the city\u2019s intent to use the grant to catalyze private investment in\nSouth Oak Cliff\n.\nThe deal requires Russell Glen to execute a formal grant agreement by the end of next year, start site work by late 2028, and invest at least $30 million by 2029.\nCity funds are earmarked for the infrastructure that has historically held back development in this part of Dallas: roadway upgrades, utilities and site prep that can make or break a project of this scale. Construction is expected to begin next year, with Republic Property Group serving as construction manager.\nRussell Glen acquired the property in 2022 from the late Pettis Norman, the former Dallas Cowboys tight end whose business and civic work made him a prominent figure in Southern\nDallas\n.\nMaiden said the team approached the design \u201cmethodically\u201d to reflect Norman\u2019s vision and deliver \u201chigh-quality residences that remain attainable,\u201d positioning Rivulet as a catalyst for the city\u2019s Education Corridor surrounding UNT Dallas.\nPhase one will focus on 70 acres, setting up pad sites for housing and early trail connections to the city\u2019s network. Phase two turns to the commercial component, where securing a grocer is a priority \u2014 a familiar hurdle in neighborhoods that have struggled to attract full-service supermarkets.\nFounded in 2019, Russell Glen has roughly $450 million in projects completed or underway, including its partnership in the Shops at RedBird, the high-profile remake of the former Red Bird Mall into a\nmixed-use hub\n.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "North Texas keeps rewriting the playbook for master-planned megaprojects, and a Hillwood venture is the latest of rarities: the 11-figure development.\nRoss Perot Jr.\u2019s firm unveiled plans this week for a 3,200-acre community along Interstate 35W and Robson Ranch Road in Denton that\u2019s expected to bring thousands of residences and a $10 billion price tag, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nThe project, called Landmark, was\npreviewed\nlast year as\nDenton\u2019s\nfirst true master-planned community, though its cost was not available at the time.\nPerot called the project \u201cthe best product that we\u2019ve done,\u201d framing it as a blueprint for the region\u2019s next generation of large-scale development.\nThe land \u2014 on the historic Hunter Ranch \u2014 has been held by the Perot family since 1987 and is being activated as Hillwood\u2019s first combined residential and mixed-use development of this magnitude.\nThe numbers reflect the ambition.\nLandmark is planned for 6,000 single-family homes and 3,000 apartments. About 900 acres will be reserved for commercial development, including Denton\u2019s first H-E-B, which will anchor the initial retail phase.\nThe first 120 commercial acres are already being marketed for retail, dining and entertainment tenants.\nThe initial construction phase includes 747 single-family lots served by nine builders \u2014 American Legend, Coventry, David Weekley, Drees, Highland, M/I Homes, Perry, Toll Brothers and Tri Pointe \u2014 with model homes slated for next spring.\nThe grocery store and 600 apartments will rise in the same phase, and\nHillwood\nexpects the grocery-anchored retail to open in 2027.\nThe community\u2019s outline also includes 1,100 acres of parkland, which Hillwood says will form one of Texas\u2019 largest natural preserves. That space includes Pilot Knob, an 830-foot rock outcrop long used as a lookout and signal point, from Caddo tribes to Spanish explorers to outlaw Sam Bass.\nLandmark\u2019s civic layer is notable as well: three Denton ISD schools and a network of STEAM-focused learning parks are planned, part of Hillwood\u2019s pitch that this is not merely housing but long-term community infrastructure.\nHillwood president Mike Berry called the site \u201ca huge clean sheet of paper\u201d that will become a \u201csignificant economic engine.\u201d Denton Mayor Gerard Hudspeth said the project answers a high-end housing shortage identified in a recent study. Hillwood\u2019s Andrew Pieper said the firm sees Denton\u2019s growth trajectory paralleling Frisco\u2019s \u2014 just a few years behind, but on the same arc.\nMaster-planned communities are popping up all over the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, but rarely do they reach such an expense.\nOne exception is\nFrisco\u2019s\n$10 billion\nFields\ndevelopment, which started construction in 2019. It offers more than 2,500 acres of development, including 8,500 multifamily units, 14,000 single-family homes and 1 million square feet of office space. Fields is home to PGA of America\u2019s headquarters and the $520 million Omni PGA Resort, as well as a 97-acre Universal Kids Resort theme park opening next year.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

A trust dropped $9.6 million on a penthouse at\n30 East 29th Street\n. The seller,\nKFO Property NYC GMBH\n, had owned the condo since 2023, when the entity purchased the pad for $12.7 million. The unit, a duplex, spans 2,600 square feet and has three bedrooms and three bathrooms. It also has two fireplaces and more than 600 square feet of outdoor space. The seller put the residence on the market in February 2024, seeking $13.2 million.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nFlushing had the priciest recorded commercial transaction in the Big Apple, with the sale of what appears to be part of a mixed-use complex at\n131-02 40th Road\nfor $32 million.

The seller was the real estate arm of the Gindi family, which founded the discount retailer. The buyer was the\nAbed family\n. A JLL Capital Markets team of\nEthan Stanton, Jeffrey Julien, Brendan Maddigan\nand\nMichael Mazzara\nrepresented the seller, and Specialized Realty Group\u2019s\nMichael Feratovic\nrepresented the buyer.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nOn the Upper East Side,\nIsis and Christopher Louw\n\u2014 he is a financier \u2014 dropped $9.4 million on a full-floor sponsor unit at\n201 East 74th Street\n, which was developed by\nElad Group\n.

Opponents of the legislation predicted it would trigger rents to increase as landlords worked to fold these fees into rents.\nCitywide, the median rent grew by 8.2 percent in October compared to the same time last year, and the median rent in each borough also increased, according to an analysis by The Real Deal of rental data from listings platform StreetEasy.\nBut Staten Island\u2019s median rent grew the most, surging by 16.4 percent year over year in October to $3,200 a month, per TRD\u2019s analysis.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "This week saw the major blowup of one of the country\u2019s largest apartment landlords.\nFairstead has about\n$7.8 billion in assets\nand projects in the pipeline and 24,000 housing units across 28 states with a goal to grow even bigger.\nBut internal disputes sparked multiple legal fights, including one that saw a\nlengthy opinion\ncome down late last month. The trial involved 10 witnesses and nearly 2,600 exhibits, providing a play-by-play of the drama and negotiation at Fairstead, as well as showing an example of what happens when a business takes off at lightning speed.\nSlower to take off are significant office projects in Manhattan.\nBut after the opening of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s shining office tower, all eyes are on the next big skyscraper set to reshape Manhattan\u2019s office skyline.\nVornado Realty Trust\nfiled a construction permit application\nfor a high-rise at 350 Park Avenue. Vornado is partnering with Rudin Management and hedge fund Citadel on the development of the tower located between East 50th and 51st streets.\nThe permit application describes a 62-story building totaling more than 2 million square feet. Citadel, in addition to being a partner on the project, agreed to rent 850,000 square feet in the tower.\nIn Brooklyn, a townhouse\nset the record\nfor priciest sale in the borough.\nEli Gindi, a member of the acclaimed\nGindi real estate family\n, sold his home at 2126 East Fourth Street in South Brooklyn\u2019s Gravesend neighborhood for $32 million, according to property records. The buyer was identified as Victor Hakim, chief executive officer and founder of Choice Home Warranty.\nThe deal easily surpassed the borough\u2019s previous record for a single-family sale, set at 8 Montague Terrace in Brooklyn Heights, which sold for $25.5 million in 2020.\nAndrew Farkas is big-dealing hunting, too. His Island Capital put the Lexington Hotel in Midtown East\nup for sale\n, eyeing a price of about $275 million for the 725-key property.\nFarkas\u2019 joint venture\nacquired it in 2021 for $185 million\n. The hotel had been closed due to the pandemic and renovated by its previous owner, DiamondRock Hospitality. It reopened under the Marriott International Autograph Collection brand shortly after the trade.\nThe Lexington is the last major \u201cbig-box\u201d hotel in the neighborhood, meaning it could benefit from nearby developments such as the aforementioned JPMorgan HQ.\nFinally, we take a breath and look back, for it was one year ago this week that the City Council\napproved\nthe Fairness in Apartment Rental Expenses (FARE) Act, which banned forcing tenants to pay fees for rental brokers they did not hire.\nProponents of the measure argued that the previous dynamic gave landlords more leverage to raise rents at lease renewal, knowing tenants likely wanted to avoid upfront costs.\nBut opponents, such as the Real Estate Board of New York,\nblamed the law\nfor rising rents and the disappearance of public listings. REBNY is even awaiting an appeal for a legal challenge.\nSo with one year since passage \u2014 and five months since enactment \u2014 our residential and politics team\nlooked\nat how the FARE Act has actually affected the city\u2019s residential market. Time to separate fact from fiction.\n",

        "content": "Zillow is picking fights with not only what\u2019s still a fairly new brokerage in\nCompass\n, but also the traditional and established infrastructure of residential real estate.\nMultiple listing service operators in major markets, including\nChicago\nand\nSan Antonio\n, are under fire from Zillow for giving agents platforms to list homes where fellow brokers can see offerings without blasting them to the broader public through online portals like Zillow\u2019s.\nThe Chicago MLS operator Midwest Real Estate Data\u2019s perspective, that every member\u2011broker should have equal access, is under pressure \u2014 especially from Compass\u2019 push for brokerage exclusives. MRED\u2019s own recent defense of its private listing system emphasized its commitment to ensuring \u201call\u202four\u202fbrokerages and brokers have access to all listings within your market.\u201d\nYet MRED described its private\u2011listing network as an \u201calternative to a one\u2011size\u2011fits\u2011all model,\u201d and Zillow\u2019s demand that its brokers ditch it as \u201cdevoid of compassion and understanding.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a problem with that logic. While MRED is defending itself against Zillow\u2019s crackdown on private listings \u2014 which the real estate tech company says could start leading to listings being blocked from its website \u2014 the MLS is also taking a stand against office exclusives like those\nCompass is pushing its brokers to use\n.\nOffice exclusives offer a shade of privacy even beyond private listing networks, by ensuring that only agents from within a particular brokerage have access to them before the rest of the industry.\nHomes marketed on the MLS-owned private listing network, on the other hand, are still visible to all agents subscribed to MRED\u2019s operation. There are 45,000 real estate professionals in Chicagoland, southeast Wisconsin and northwest Indiana who subscribe to MRED. That\u2019s a lot of people.\nWithout judging the economics of whether private or exclusive listings benefit sellers, buyers or nobody in comparison to the standard MLS, can\u2019t MRED\u2019s argument that there\u2019s a need for privacy in the marketplace also be applied to the Compass stance? For sellers seeking discretion during sensitive life events such as death, divorce or a recently incurred disability, wouldn\u2019t limiting their listing\u2019s exposure to a single brokerage rather than every broker in the region offer more shelter?\nYes, Compass has more agents than that overall throughout the nation. But you could argue that a smaller slice of a seller\u2019s local peers would be likely to catch wind of a listing marketed as an office exclusive rather than to every real estate agent in a region.\nOne notable point is that MRED\u2019s \u201ccompassionate privacy\u201d argument is internally consistent: the listings are still shared among all MLS participants (via private listing networks) and eventually enter the public domain. But MRED needs to be careful with its line of defense, if it doesn\u2019t want to lose ground over the listing flow to Compass. Without caution, the \u201cprivacy\u201d logic becomes a shelter for brokerage exclusivity.\nThe same line of thinking invoked for protecting sellers\u2019 privacy can, and arguably should, be applied to scrutinize brokerage practices that limit buyer or agent access. If MRED is right to say that \u201cone\u2011size\u2011fits\u2011all\u201d transparency are inconsiderate to seller circumstance, then the converse\u00a0 could also be argued: brokerage access models that favor some agents and buyers over others risk being insensitive to the broader buyer community and to the premise of market fairness.\nThe implication for the industry is real. As listing controls evolve \u2014 via private networks, coming\u2011soon phases or brokerage\u2011only platforms \u2014 the MLS ideal of open cooperation becomes harder to sustain. Brokerages will need to defend both their marketing strategies and the impact they have on the exclusivity of markets; MLS operators will need to decide whether to uphold broad access or tolerate tiered systems masked as \u201cseller choice.\u201d\nThe discussion invites inquiry: when does seller privacy slide into buyer disadvantage? And when does brokerage exclusivity masquerade as choice? That challenge goes beyond Illinois and Chicago\u2011area MLSs; it\u2019s central to how the brokerage\u2011portal\u2011MLS ecosystem will be defined in the next chapter of U.S. residential real\u2011estate.",

It could be related to a distressed office portfolio that has made headlines recently. But there is some good news to share: the landlord landed a tenant.\nEcrypt announced it inked a long-term, off-market lease for 23,000 square feet at Kravetz\u2019 29899 Agoura Road, once home to the Los Angeles Rams. The deal is valued at more than $7 million, according to a\nrelease\n.\nEarlier, Kravetz-connected entities defaulted on the commercial mortgage-backed securities debt secured by a five-office-property portfolio located throughout the San Fernando Valley \u2014 and faced calls to\ncede control\nto a court-appointed receiver; 29899 Agoura Road is part of that portfolio.\nA Wells Fargo Bank unit, on behalf of the securities holders, and the special servicer claim the entities owe about $72 million. That\u2019s more than the Kravetz portfolio is worth. According to Morningstar Credit, the offices are valued at $50 million, half of their underwriting, months before the pandemic. The offices are only 71 percent occupied, compared to 98 percent at issuance, per Morningstar, but the latest lease amounts to 7 percent of the rentable space.\nIt\u2019ll provide a boost. But enough to save Kravetz? Who knows.\nThe court hasn\u2019t ruled on whether to appoint a receiver to take control of the five-office-property portfolio or not \u2014 but according to the lender, the borrowers, entities connected to Kravetz and his Realty Bancorp, consented in the loan documents to the appointment of a receiver in the event of a default with or without notice of a hearing.\nKravetz and attorneys for the plaintiff and defendants did not respond to a request for comment.\nBad Robot sells\nIf you\u2019ve ever binge-watched\nLost,\nyou probably remember the red robot that appeared on your screen after every episode. It was the logo for J.J. Abrams\u2019 Bad Robot. Well, Abrams\nsold\nthe brick building that housed the production company for about $31 million. The buyer is a mystery \u2014 but could be a client of HCVT chief executive Vicken Haleblian.\nThe deal for the 18,000 square-foot creative office space located in Santa Monica, near the pier, comes out to around $1,700 per square foot. The building has a big sign on the outside that says the National Typewriter Company, not Bad Robots\u2026if you know, you know.\nChrome Hearts buys\nEveryone wants a beach house, so it\u2019s no surprise that one of California\u2019s priciest per-key deals ever and priciest all year was a small, stunning Malibu hotel that calls itself \u201cyour California beach house.\u201d\nChrome Hearts, owned by Richard and Laurie Stark,\npurchased\nthe Surfrider for $37.5 million. That comes out to about $1.9 million a room. The luxe 20-room oceanfront property was owned by Dauntless Capital Partners, and the Marella Group brokered the deal.\nExceptions\nThe two deals mentioned above are anomalies in Los Angeles commercial real estate.\nCreative offices are unlike other spaces that haven\u2019t recovered post-pandemic \u2014 which are not typically connected to J.J. Abrams and his famed production company or locations of star-studded cocktail parties, so the general rules don\u2019t apply. Santa Monica, for example, has a 26 percent vacancy rate in its office sector, and properties aren\u2019t trading for more than a thousand dollars a square foot.\nWhen it comes to hotels, many are defaulting on debt, facing foreclosure and a challenging sales environment, in part because of the so-called mansion tax that has resulted in fewer commercial trades. Homelessness is believed to have contributed to a dip in tourism that\u2019s hurt revenues, and a $30 minimum wage for hotel workers is also spooking investors.\nThe exception, of course, is the one-of-a-kind Surfrider in Malibu, where David Beckham and Margot Robbie have stayed and there is a guest-only rooftop bar and restaurant that overlooks the Pacific.\n",

        "content": "If Merriam-Webster had to choose a Word of the Year for San Francisco, it might go with \u201cup.\u201d As in\nrents\n,\nhome values\n,\nventure capital funding\n,\noffice leases\n, and a\ngeneral sense of optimism\nthat just a few years ago seemed to evaporate like the marine layer in late morning.\nHowever, this week, one filled with prominent names and properties, \u201cdown\u201d might be a more apt characterization.\nDown, as in, the San Francisco Centre\u2019s value after the property foreclosed and\nwas sold back to bank lenders this week\n. JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank bought the roughly 800,000-square-foot Market Street property for just $133 million, a steep fall from its 2016 valuation of $1.2 billion. Of course, maintaining value often requires maintaining active leases, which the San Francisco Centre has failed to do. Over the last few years, 95% of the property\u2019s tenants, including anchors such as Bloomingdale\u2019s and Nordstrom, have left, relegating the city\u2019s largest shopping mall into a dead mall.\nThe property represents a sort of paradox for the city\u2019s latest and ascendant chapter. It\u2019s a major commercial space in a major commercial corridor, yet no one has presented a meaningful vision for what the prominently located retail center could add to San Francisco\u2019s future. Conversion to housing appears to be out of the question due to the center\u2019s\nbig mall bones \u2014 large floor plates and few interior windows \u2014 that make a residential retrofit prohibitively expensive. Keeping the mall as a shopping center also raises questions, considering the general uncertainty around the viability of retail.\nCBRE, the broker for the property, is actively courting buyers in any case.\n\u201cDown\u201d also applies to takedowns, which is what the owner of the TransAmerica Pyramid is attempting to fight off this week as he faces a lawsuit from business partners and dissatisfied condo owners.\nMichael Shvo, chairman and CEO of the SHVO real estate development company,\nwas accused of participating in a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) conspiracy\n. As The Real Deal\u2019s Jake Indursky reports, the lawsuit was filed by the Core Club and its CEO Jennie Enterprise, and two residents at Shvo\u2019s Mandarin Oriental condo project in Manhattan. The suit alleges that Shvo lured \u201cinvestors, condo purchasers, tenants, and business partners into multi-million dollar transactions, the proceeds of which were diverted to enrich Shvo and his associates, and to fund their lavish lifestyles.\u201d\nAfter inking a deal in 2021, Core Club, the elite, members-only social organization was set to lease the first three floors of the TransAmerica Pyramid after inking a deal in 2021. However, those plans were interrupted by a series of legal issues that boiled over into this week\u2019s RICO allegations.\n\u201cDown\u201d also pertains to a step down, as in Christine Pelosi\u2019s political ambitions. As talk around Rep. Nancy Pelosi\u2019s retirement had picked up in recent years, so, too, did the notion that her daughter, Christine, would step up when her mother stepped down. Yet, a few days after the elder Pelosi announced her retirement, the younger Pelosi said she wouldn\u2019t be seeking the seat either. Instead, Christine\nannounced her intent\nto represent San Francisco in the state senate.\nThat state senate post is held by Sen. Scott Wiener, who is leaving the senate to run for Pelosi\u2019s congressional seat. Wiener, the housing policy guru whose legislation has reshaped the state\u2019s approach to housing production, launched his congressional campaign last month. Without\u00a0 a Pelosi on the ticket for the first time in 40 years, Wiener\u2019s chances to bring his housing momentum to Washington\nhave improved by orders of magnitude.\n",

        "content": "Hospitality is supposed to be about comfort, leisure and service, not guests using words like \u201cstranded\u201d or \u201chomeless.\u201d Yet those were the terms popping up in headlines this week as Sonder\u2019s collapse rippled through buildings around the world.\nThe short-term rental operator, once a proptech darling and a $2 billion public company, announced it\u2019s preparing to file for\nChapter 7 liquidation\nin the U.S., with parallel insolvency proceedings abroad. Operations ceased almost immediately.\nThe collapse didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. By the time interim CEO Janice Sears stepped in\nearlier this year\n, the company was juggling $1.5 billion in liabilities against $1 billion in assets, negotiating with creditors and watching its cash position shrink to fumes. Still, the speed of the unraveling has caught a lot of landlords and guests off guard.\nThe final blow came last weekend, when Marriott\nabruptly terminated\nits year-old licensing agreement, pulling roughly 9,000 \u201cSonder by Marriott Bonvoy\u201d units out of its system overnight. For Marriott, the move barely dents projected net room growth. For Sonder, it was catastrophic.\nThe\n20-year deal\nwas supposed to be a lifeline, delivering $126 million in financing and the credibility of a global brand. Instead, integration tensions, reporting errors, investor lawsuits and an already-shaky balance sheet pushed Sonder past the point of recovery.\nAnd once operations stopped, the fallout began immediately. In New York, the Moinian family\nsued Sonder\nfor at least $10 million, alleging the company abandoned two properties \u2014 2 Washington Street and 37 West 24th Street \u2014 mid-crisis. Guests reportedly refused to vacate or found themselves locked out altogether, unable to access their rooms or belongings. Similar scenes played out across other owners\u2019 buildings, from Silverstein to BLDG Management, all suddenly left to figure out stranded occupants and unclear lease obligations. Even employees said they were left without any meaningful direction.\nIt\u2019s a messy, very public end to a company that sold itself as a sleek alternative to Airbnb. And it leaves the industry with two questions: what happens to these master-leased properties, and what happens to the model Sonder helped popularize?\nIn the near term, landlords with Sonder exposure are likely staring down months of legal wrangling. Chapter 7 means a court-appointed trustee will liquidate assets rather than restructure them, so owners may be waiting a while before they fully regain control of their units. Operators that competed with Sonder for inventory may see short-term opportunity as units come back to market, but that also depends on how many need work before they can be repositioned. Longer-term, the sector is likely to rethink how much risk it wants to take on from operators with aggressive growth plans and thin margins.\nDemand for flexible, hotel-style apartments isn\u2019t going away, but owners and lenders may push harder for management agreements or hybrid structures that don\u2019t leave them holding the bag when an operator stumbles.\nThere was plenty of other real estate news this week. The Alexander brothers dealt with a legal setback, Michael Shvo faced RICO conspiracy accusations and record-breaking listings hit the market in South Florida. These stories and more below.\nJudge denies Alexander brothers\u2019 motions to dismiss sex trafficking charges\nA federal judge has ruled that\nsex trafficking charges\nagainst the Alexander brothers will move forward to trial in January, denying most of the defense\u2019s motions to dismiss. Judge Valerie Caproni of the Southern District of New York said prosecutors had sufficiently alleged that the brothers \u201cconspired to entice women and girls to travel\u201d for sex using \u201cforce and drugs.\u201d\nShvo foes unite to accuse embattled developer of civil RICO conspiracy\nA new lawsuit accuses\ndeveloper Michael Shvo\n, who made a dramatic exit from a trophy Miami project and fended off lawsuits at a number of his developments, of being engaged in a yearslong Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) conspiracy. The lawsuit was filed by some familiar foes for Shvo, including the Core Club and its founder and CEO Jennie Enterprise, and two disgruntled residents at Shvo\u2019s troubled Mandarin Oriental condo project at 685 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.\nTrophy properties for sale: Record-breaking listings hit market as South Florida\u2019s busy season revs up\nNine single-family homes are on the market in South Florida asking\n$100 million or more\n, with some ranging as high as $285 million. Sellers are seeking unprecedented prices for sprawling compounds that include amenities like shooting ranges, bowling alleys, jazz lounges, theaters, spas, gyms and massive garages for storing and displaying car collections.\nBlackstone Real Estate co-head Kathleen McCarthy to depart after 15 years\nBlackstone\u2019s Kathleen McCarthy, who helped grow the firm\u2019s property arm into a $320 billion behemoth,\nwill depart\nby year\u2019s end after 15 years with the company. McCarthy, 47, has served since 2018 as global co-head of Blackstone Real Estate \u2014 the world\u2019s largest private property investor \u2014 and will step down to \u201cexplore new opportunities,\u201d the company said.\nFARE Act, one year later: Here\u2019s how the broker fee law has played out\nOne year after New York City passed the\nFairness in Apartment Rental Expenses\n(FARE) Act, the rental market is still adjusting to a rule that flipped who pays brokers\u2019 fees. The law, which bars landlords from forcing tenants to cover brokers they didn\u2019t hire, immediately caused listings to vanish from StreetEasy and REBNY\u2019s platform as landlords scrambled to comply.\nMalibu exception: Boutique hotel deal among priciest in California history\nLuxury fashion brand Chrome Hearts, owned by Richard and Laurie Stark, purchased a small Malibu hotel called the Surfrider for\n$37.5 million\nto notch one of California\u2019s priciest per-key deals ever. It\u2019s an exception to the general rule of the hotel market these days in Los Angeles, where numerous properties are facing foreclosure and a tough sales environment.\nFannie Mae sues Jon Venetos\u2019 Lurin Capital over $77M default\nFannie Mae slapped Jon Venetos\u2019 Lurin Capital with a lawsuit accusing the firm of defaulting on a\n$77.2 million loan\ntied to a Houston apartment complex. Fannie Mae further accuses Lurin of failing to keep the property in good condition. In addition to mold, roof leaks and cracked stairs, Fannie alleges some residents at the Houston apartments don\u2019t have access to running water.\nVornado, Rudin\u2019s 350 Park office tower files for construction\nVornado Realty Trust has filed a construction permit application for a high-rise at\n350 Park Avenue\n. Vornado is partnering with Rudin Management and hedge fund Citadel on the development of the tower located between East 50th and 51st streets.\nHere\u2019s what you missed at The Real Deal\u2019s Miami Forum\nMiami\u2019s status as a top destination for real estate developers, brokers, foreign investors and New Yorkers was on full display at\nThe Real Deal\u2019s Miami Real Estate Forum\nlast week. The two-day conference attracted thousands of attendees and dozens of developers, brokers, lenders, architects and other vendors who featured their products and projects at the showcase component.\n",

        "content": "Interest rates brought a stubborn chill to the\nhousing market\n, and for a while, luxury sales seemed immune.\nThat\u2019s no longer the case.\nToday, multimillion-dollar estates throughout the Texas Triangle languish on the market \u2014 to the extent that this sluggishness is disrupting the way luxury buyers, sellers and brokers\ndo business in Austin\n.\nHigh property taxes incentivize privacy in the Texas capital, and the local real estate board has long looked the other way, allowing a robust network for private sales to flourish. The market\u2019s high inventory and decreasing prices, however, are eroding this system.\nSellers who can no longer afford privacy are ditching private platforms like Clubhouse and the Austin Luxury Network in favor of the broad exposure provided by the MLS.\nEven though the luxury segment is suffering from the same ailment that\u2019s spread through the wider market, there are still a few stalwart pockets of strength, namely,\nhistoric luxury homes\nand branded luxury condos.\nHistoric homes are proving to be insulated from market swings, said Douglas Elliman agent Emily Waldmann, who works in Austin. Plus, historic homes are rare in Texas metros, where it\u2019s abundantly popular to tear down an old home when renovation is costly. Dallas is the biggest offender.\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum, the housing market doesn\u2019t appear to have dampened\ndemand for the state\u2019s first branded condo projects\n.\nSatya is building Texas\u2019 first standalone St. Regis condo project in Houston\u2019s Rice Military neighborhood. Since opening the sales gallery in mid-September, the developer has logged $100 million in contracts. The most recent deal tops $2,000 per square foot. The rate outpaces luxury single-family homes in Houston, which usually fetch between $500 and $1,000 per square foot..\nHere\u2019s what else is going on in Texas real estate news:\nJon Venetos\u2019\nmultifamily distress\n, which\nstarted in Florida\n, is permeating the Texas Triangle. Fannie Mae slapped Venetos\u2019 Lurin Capital with a lawsuit accusing the firm of\ndefaulting on a $77.2 million loan\ntied to Latitude 2976, a Houston apartment complex. The latest legal challenge for the firm comes two weeks after a Collin County judge granted the city of Plano a\ntemporary restraining order against Lurin\nand ordered residents of Evana Grove Apartments to vacate due to unsafe conditions.\nHarwood International\u2019s financial unraveling has\nclaimed another piece of its Dallas empire\n. The Uptown landlord handed back the keys to\nHarwood No. 1\nat a foreclosure sale earlier this month. Oklahoma-based First United Bank took control of Harwood\u2019s first development, a seven-story, 106,000-square-foot building at 2651 North Harwood Street, in a $27.2 million credit bid. It\u2019s Harwood\u2019s third building foreclosure this year and the second it\u2019s handed back to a lender. As the firm struggles to stabilize its portfolio, it\u2019s been\noffloading properties to San Francisco-based hedge fund TPG\n.\nAfter narrowly surviving the last legislative session,\nTexas\u2019 hemp industry\nhas been dealt a potentially fatal blow in the bill to reopen the federal government.

        "content": "Now that most Dodgers critics are done (sort of) blowing a fuse and claiming the team paid for its World Series win, some interesting food for thought has emerged with the start of the offseason.\nA caller into television broadcaster\nBrodie Brazil\n\u2019s YouTube show wondered whether a mixed-use entertainment complex around Dodger Stadium would ever be in the cards. Brazil\u2019s take was that an entertainment district is not likely considering the dual ownership (Guggenheim Baseball Management and former team owner Frank McCourt) of the parking lots surrounding the facility and the lack of transit options for moving people in and out of the stadium, which is on a graded hilltop in Elysian Park, and has its hands full with traffic on game days.\nStill, the question about an entertainment district stoked an additional one: Could\nhigh-rise condo living\n\u2014 often one component to stadium-anchored, mixed-use projects \u2014 thrive in Elysian Park.\nMaybe, but no one should expect anything in the heart of L.A. to be comparable to the luxury high-rise development taking place on the Westside \u2014 with or without a world champion baseball team as an anchor.\nIn particular, Cain International\u2019s One Beverly Hills development and the incoming ultra-luxe\nAman Residences\nare being closely watched for their impact on the market. We reported earlier this year local agents have said the ultra-luxury segment can command as much as $3,000 to $5,000 per square foot locally.\nThat\u2019s really not a figure that pencils out in the central or eastern part of Los Angeles.\nLook no further than Downtown L.A., which is less than two miles south of Dodger Stadium. The Ritz Carlton Residences luxury condos, which opened in 2010, were the final puzzle piece of the L.A. Live mixed-use project anchored by Crypto.com Arena. There are currently 19 units available at the Ritz with the average price per square foot of those units $924 and a median ask of $1.8 million, according to data from RubyHome Luxury Real Estate.\nThe largest condo deal so far this year in downtown was at 1155 South Grand Avenue, which traded for $1.8 million, or $766 per square foot, based on Zillow data. That\u2019s a sliver of the $39.1 million paid in January for a Century City penthouse at 1 West Century Drive, which came out to $4,153 per square foot.\nSo, would building a condo tower work even near the stadium? Probably not, but it\u2019s fun to think about.\nThe strong get stronger\u2026\nThere is some significant shuffling afoot across Southern California brokerages.\nLuis Carrion picked up and moved his business\u2019 franchise affiliate license from Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices California Properties to Coldwell Banker Real Estate to become\nColdwell Banker Envision\n.\nThe operation has 14 offices and more than 1,300 agents that counted $2.4 billion in volume from over 1,000 deals to\nrank sixth\nin this year\u2019s list of Los Angeles County\u2019s top brokerages.\nCarrion positioned the move as a \u201ccustomer service and sustained growth\u201d play.\nBerkshire Hathaway HomeServices California Properties\u2019 company-owned brokerage business remains with over 2,000 people across nearly 50 offices, in addition to three franchises in Sierra Madre, Palos Verdes, Redondo Beach and San Luis Obispo. The company-owned business did not rank in this year\u2019s list of top brokerages by\nTRD Research\n.\nElsewhere, two Keller Williams franchisees filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Wednesday.\nThe Pismo Beach brokerage listed 0 to $50,000 in assets, with between $1 million to $10 million in liabilities, according to documents filed in bankruptcy court for the southern district of California. Meanwhile, the Oxnard business posted the same amount in assets, with liabilities amounting to anywhere from $10 million to $50 million.\nBeverly Hills Estates parks it in the Palisades\nSpeaking of the business of brokerages, the Beverly Hills Estates is moving into the\nPacific Palisades\n.\nThe West Hollywood-headquartered brokerage revealed a new division called Palisades Estates, led by Jacqueline Chernov. The new business will start from an Airstream\u00a0 parked on an Alphabet Streets lot owned by Chernov until they find permanent space, potentially on Sunset \u00a0 Boulevard.\n\u201cWe started [Beverly Hills Estates] with just Rayni and I and our small team, and we\u2019ve grown this into a really great, small-big operation,\u201d said Beverly Hills Estates co-founder and President Branden Williams.\nChernov is already putting out the call for \u201cexperienced agents, particularly in the Palisades and in Malibu\u201d to further build out the office, which already has about half of the 20 agents she\u2019s targeting.\nNext up, Beverly Hills Estates is eyeing similar moves in the Valley, Malibu, Montecito and the Eastside.\n",

        "content": "Sometimes foreclosure is a family affair.\nThe Ostad brothers,\na trio of New York real estate investors\n, have been named as defendants in nine foreclosure suits related to loans totaling more than $70 million. Edward and Michael Ostad are named in all the cases, while Steven Ostad is named in three of them.\nThe lender is trying to recover some money out of the Ostads personally, pointing to guaranty agreements they signed. The brothers stopped making payments on the loans in April, according to the plaintiff.\nThat\u2019s the same month that\nMichael and Edward sued Steven\n, hoping to dissolve their family partnerships.\nThe two older Ostad brothers lead fix-and-flip lender Flatiron Realty Capital, which does not appear to be involved in the properties or foreclosure cases. The pair describe themselves as \u201csuccessful urologists,\u201d in addition to investors.\nIn court filings earlier this year, the two painted Steven as the black sheep of the family. They claimed the youngest Ostad \u201chas never had a job\u201d and \u201chas a lifelong history of serious personal issues and self-destructive behaviors.\u201d Michael and Edward accused Steven of standing in the way of their effort to dissolve the partnerships. The youngest brother had racked up millions in judgements and debts, they alleged.\nSteven is the founder of residential brokerage Empire City Realty and lender Real Quick Capital, although both appear to be closed. The case is still pending.\nSteven\u2019s attorney said the youngest Ostad is a passive investor in the properties named in the recent foreclosure suits and was \u201cshocked\u201d to learn payments weren\u2019t made.\n\u201cWe find it more than coincidental that debt service payments allegedly stopped in April of 2025 \u2013 just as Steven\u2019s brothers sued him on April 14, 2025,\u201d Christopher Milito of Morrison Cohen said via email.\nMichael and Edward did not immediately respond to requests to comment.\nSteven\u2019s investments were located in the Highbridge and Woodstock neighborhoods of the Bronx, as well as in Manhattan\u2019s Hamilton Heights. The properties controlled by Michael and Edward without Steven were located in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, East Harlem, Hamilton Heights and the Fordham neighborhood of the Bronx.\nThe plaintiff took over the loans after the\ncollapse of the original lender, Signature Bank\n. It\u2019s now trying to recoup at least some of the investment from the Ostad brothers personally. In letters to the brothers included in court documents, the lender accuses the investors of breaching guaranty agreements they signed by not turning over rental income after the default. That entitles the lender to collect those funds from the brothers personally, it argued.\nMilito, an attorney for Steven, noted the complaint does allege misappropriation of rent but makes no specific allegations of misconduct against Steven specifically.\n\u201cIt could not, as Steven\u2019s brothers were in exclusive control of the properties\u2019 finances,\u201d he wrote.\n",

        "content": "As homeowners begin to receive this year\u2019s property tax bills, Cook County\u2019s poorest communities are once again bearing the bulk of the county\u2019s rising\ntax burden\n.\nThe hardest hit neighborhood this year is West Garfield Park, where the median homeowners saw their bill jump by $2,000 or about 133 percent, a study from Cook County Treasurer Maria Pappas found.\nThe higher tax bills will likely strain\nmany homeowners\nin the West Chicago neighborhood where the median household income is $38,000, according to Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning.\nSimilarly, in the South Side neighborhoods of North Lawndale and Englewood, the median tax bill jumped by over 80 percent.\nPappas\u2019 study noted a sharp\ndecline in property values\nin the Loop since the pandemic is pushing the county\u2019s property tax burden elsewhere.\n\u201cWhen the Loop gets a cold, the rest of the city gets pneumonia,\u201d Pappas said in a news release accompanying the findings. \u201cI\u2019m particularly concerned how lower-income homeowners in struggling communities are going to be able to pay their bills.\u201d\nFor the 2024 tax year, the amount of taxes imposed on all commercial properties in the Loop fell by nearly $130 million.\nHow that burden gets shared is determined by the Cook County Assessor, a position currently held by\nFritz Kaegi\n. But Kaegi\u2019s office has also published its own reports in prior years criticizing commercial property owners\u2019\nvarious efforts to repeal their assessed values\nand reduce their overall tax burden.\nHe has said the practice of appealing commercial property values through various channels has led to a \u201csystemic undervaluation\u201d of the county\u2019s commercial properties.\nIllinois also requires local government bodies such as city councils and school districts to set their budgets before property values are assessed. That means rather than the assessor giving budget makers a target of available property tax revenue to aim for, local agencies give property owners a total dollar amount they\u2019ll need to generate via taxation, and the assessor determines how to distribute the bill.\nDespite ongoing efforts to\nreform the property tax system\nin Cook County, the median residential tax bill saw its largest percentage city increase in at least 30 years for the 2024 tax year, Pappas\u2019 study found.\nThe median residential tax bill in the city rose 16.7 percent to $4,457, according to the study.\nIn the northern and northwest suburbs, where incomes and median home values are higher, the typical bill rose by 15.7 percent, to $7,008.\nThose increases feel more severe in areas of the county that are losing population like the south suburbs. For the 2024 tax year, the median tax bill in south and southwest suburbs rose by 19.9 percent, to $6,117, Pappas found.\nAs a result, many homeowners fail to pay their property taxes in full. A prior study from Pappas\u2019 office found that for the 2023 tax year, the southern suburb of Harvey billed $57.9 million in taxes but collected only $33.75 million \u2014 a 58.29 percent collection rate \u2014 leaving more than $24 million unpaid. It was the lowest collection rate in the county.\nWhen taxes go unpaid and municipal services decline, more residents may choose to move elsewhere, leaving an even higher tax burden for those who stay behind.\n",

        "content": "After I wrote about\nthe agony\nof dealing with the Landmarks Preservation Commission, I received a request from\nVital City\n.\nThe civic group wanted other examples of ways Zohran Mamdani could make the city more functional and affordable \u2014 not fantastical ideas that cost billions of dollars, but simple \u201cblocking and tackling,\u201d to use a football term for the basics.\nHere is one that speaks to a larger problem of bureaucratic sludge.\nEvery two years, I help my father-in-law, who is 88, renew his\nsenior citizen homeowners\u2019 exemption\n, or SCHE. Like many government programs for seniors, it involves a process that most elderly people cannot possibly figure out, even if English were their first language, which is often not the case in New York City.\nReal estate people who deal with government programs and regulations know exactly what I\u2019m talking about. Completing the forms, assembling the documents and submitting them is rarely a simple task. Often it\u2019s maddening. Sometimes it\u2019s totally useless.\nFor example, condos and co-ops with no employees must file a notarized affidavit each year promising to pay their non-existent employees a prevailing wage. Total waste of time.\nReal estate firms have staff to deal with such matters, but mom-and-pops are on their own. They can certainly empathize with senior citizens faced with these confounding tasks.\nOne solution is to award benefits automatically based on tax returns. Some programs already do that. But low-income households are not required to file tax returns. People who don\u2019t file miss out on these benefits without even realizing they exist.\nThe SCHE is not awarded based on tax returns, even though that seems possible. Why can\u2019t the government use tax returns and property tax records to figure out who qualifies? Instead, seniors have to submit paperwork \u2014 not just once to get the exemption, but every two years after that to renew it.\nFortunately, the city created an online renewal process that is a lot easier than the paper version \u2014 not easier for seniors, who struggle with technology, but for their children or grandchildren who help them with such tasks.\nUnfortunately, this year\u2019s SCHE online renewal website is broken.\nThe box for \u201cincome\u201d is grayed out, so income cannot be entered and the application cannot be submitted. I informed the Department of Finance of this problem in October, giving the city five months to fix the bug before the submission deadline of March 15, 2026.\nIt turns out that five months is not enough time for the city to un-gray a box. This week, the Finance Department informed me that the city\u2019s\ntechnology agency\nwould not fix the problem this fiscal year.\nIts exact message was, \u201cThe DOITT Team is not going to be able to correct the box that is gray shaded for the property account in inquiry for filing period TY 202627.\u201d\nMamdani got elected by running on big ideas. But there\u2019s a long list of small, more achievable things he can do to make the city work better. Real estate people should have their trade groups let him know where the bottlenecks are.\nVital City\nis also interested. Feel free to\nloop me in\ntoo.\n",

Though the total was significantly less than 41 contracts in the\nprevious period\n, the number of pending deals was on par with last year\u2019s weekly average.\nEven with the dip, 2025 is shaping up to be the second-best year for the borough\u2019s luxury market since Olshan began tracking deals nearly two decades ago. So far this year, buyers have signed contracts for more than 1,320 luxury homes, up from under 1,300 in all of 2024.\nThe most expensive home to land an inked deal was a penthouse at the Naftali Group\u2019s\n255 East 77th Street\n, asking $24 million. The 5,500-square-foot condo, which hit the market in August, has six bedrooms and six bathrooms.\nUnit PHC also features a formal dining room, views of Central Park and two loggias. It\u2019s one of 62 units in the Upper East Side development, 51 of which have found buyers with asking prices averaging roughly $2,800 per square foot.\nAmenities in the Robert A.M. Stern-designed building include a fitness center, sauna, pool and porte-cochere. Sales at the development, which launched last year, are headed by a team with Compass\u2019 development marketing arm, including Alexa Lambert, Alison Black and Shelton Smith.\nThe second priciest home to find a buyer was a condo at\n160 West 12th Street\n, asking $15 million. The apartment, which hit the market in September, last traded for $10 million in 2016.\nUnit 104 spans 2,900 square feet and has three bedrooms and three bathrooms. It also features a landscaped terrace, wood-paneled library and windowed chef\u2019s kitchen. Amenities in the building, known as the Greenwich Lane, include a pool, hot tub, fitness center and golf simulator.\nCompass\u2019 Michael Johnson and Hayim Nommaz of the Johnson &amp; Nommaz Team had the listing.\nOf the 25 properties, 17 were condos, four were co-ops, one was a condop and three were townhouses.\nThe homes asked a combined $197 million, which works out to an average price of $7.9 million and a median of $6.9 million. The typical home was on the market for nearly two years and had a discount of 4 percent.\n",

The sale marks an exit for the Carlyle Group, which took over the site in 2014 for $21.4 million, before the building existed.\nThe deal breaks down to $810,000 per unit.\nMegalith Capital assembled the parcel a year before Carlyle acquired it as part of a larger deal with the Witnesses, who spent decades unloading their vast Dumbo and Brooklyn Heights holdings after shifting headquarters upstate. Megalith is listed as the developer of the project, but the status of the firm and its partnership with Carlyle is unclear.\nAufgang Architects designed the rental, which broke ground in 2015 and wrapped in 2018, one of several developments that helped cement Dumbo\u2019s transition from industrial district to full-fledged luxury enclave.\nAvailabilities include a one-bedroom asking $4,381 a month, according to StreetEasy.\nCarlyle and Hubb both did not comment to the publication about the sale.\nPrivate equity giant Carlyle quietly\nput together\na half-billion-dollar portfolio of small apartment buildings in Brooklyn in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic. Over a one-year period, the company bought more than 130 properties in hot neighborhoods such as Bushwick, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Park Slope and Cobble Hill.\nThe spree represented one of Wall Street\u2019s biggest moves into the world of mom-and-pop landlords and an unusual approach for such a large company, buying up apartment buildings one by one.\nHubb, founded in 2011, bills itself as an all-cash buyer with more than 80 properties in its portfolio. An affiliate of the company recently\npaid $20.3 million\nfor an apartment building at 254 Water Street; the seller of the 26-unit property was Michael Alvandi\u2019s City Urban Realty, which purchased the property in 2019 for $15 million.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The public sale of the 1.8-million-square-foot property at 825 Eighth Avenue is slated for Jan. 15.\nThe entity that controls the building received a default notice last September from the owner of $190 million in mezzanine debt, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing from New York REIT Liquidating. Ownership is in default of both senior and mezzanine debt as of July, per the filing.\nGoldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank originated $260 million in mezzanine debt. The property is backed\nby $940 million in CMBS debt\noriginated by the two institutions, plus the mezzanine financing.\nProceeds from the auction will go towards paying off the mezzanine debt and funding unpaid interest payments.\nRXR and SL Green did not respond to the publication\u2019s requests for comment.\nThe debt\nwent to special servicing\nin September 2024, after law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore vacated its 617,000-square-foot space for Brookfield\u2019s Two Manhattan West, leaving Worldwide Plaza about 40 percent vacant. That space remains unfilled, and the building was only 63 percent occupied as of March, according to Morningstar, down from 91 percent in 2023.\nThat could soon worsen as Nomura Holdings \u2014 the largest tenant \u2014 plans to slash 75,000 square feet from its footprint by the beginning of 2027. The remaining 630,000 square feet is due to expire in 2033.\nThe property was appraised at $345 million in April, an\n80 percent decline\nfrom its $1.7 billion valuation in 2017, according to CMBS loan documents. That appraisal drop is expected to bring nearly $500M of losses to the property\u2019s CMBS bondholders.\nSL Green and RXR acquired a roughly 49 percent stake in 2015; the since-liquidating New York REIT holds the majority.\nLast month, DBRS Morningstar downgraded the rating to junk on the CMBS trust holding $705M of the building\u2019s debt.

The properties spent 121 days on the market, on average.\nFifty-seven luxury listings were added to the market, for a total of 1,262 listings.\nThe\nprevious week\n, buyers signed contracts for 12 properties in Miami-Dade, asking a combined $120 million.\nThe asking dollar volume for the nine single-family homes and six condos under contract last week totals $100.2 million, according to the report published by the Douglas Elliman team led by Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes.\nThe single-family homes that entered into contract last week have an average asking price of $7.8 million and spent an average of 96 days on the market. They total $30.3 million in asking dollar volume.\nThe pending sale of the waterfront home at 4042 Island Estates Drive in Aventura topped the report last week. The nearly 7,800-square-foot house, built in 2001, has five bedrooms, six bathrooms and two half-bathrooms. Compass agent Chad Carroll has the listing for the 0.4-acre property, which is asking nearly $15 million. Records show a company owned by Hillel Shohet paid $11.9 million for the home in 2022. The property includes a pool, spa, outdoor kitchen and 251 feet of water frontage.\nThe second priciest contract signed was for the non-waterfront Coral Gables house at 506 Sunset Drive, which is on the market with Compass\u2019 Ben Moss and Eric Torrente for nearly $9 million. The six-bedroom, six-and-a-half-bathroom home spans 7,354 square feet. It was built in 2008 on a 0.7-acre lot. Property records show Geidy Leon, co-founder of Doral-based Miura Cigars, owns the home. Winslow\nsold the house\nto Leon and her husband, Jorge Leon, in 2022 for $5.5 million.\nThe condos that secured buyers last week have an average asking price of $5 million and spent 96 days on the market, on average. They total $30.3 million in asking dollar volume, or an average of $1,979 per square foot.\nA condo at the\nRitz-Carlton\nBal Harbour marked the most expensive to enter into contract. Unit 1008 at 10295 Collins Avenue is asking $6.5 million or $2,350 per square foot. It is on the market with Keller Williams Realty Premier agent Fritz Wagor. Property records show a company led by private equity investor Jim Lim paid $4.5 million for the three-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bathroom condo in 2020. It spans 2,763 square feet.\nLast week in New York, buyers signed contracts for 25 homes, according to the\nlatest Olshan report\n. Their combined asking price is nearly $197.4 million, and the typical home spent 621 days on the market.\n",

        "content": "Hines is angling for one of the most recognizable office towers on the\nChicago River\n, opening negotiations to buy Boeing\u2019s former headquarters after another suitor walked away.\nThe Houston-based developer is in early talks to acquire the 36-story building at 100 North Riverside Plaza, Costar\nreported\n.\nSterling Bay\nhad the tower under contract over the summer, reportedly for $25 million to $30 million. That would\u2019ve been $32 to $39 per square foot for the 777,400-square-foot building, a price that reflected the distressed state of downtown offices.\nThat\ndeal\ncollapsed, however. A Sterling Bay spokesperson said in a statement to\nThe Real Deal\nthat the firm\u2019s due diligence \u201cdid not support advancing a transaction in the current market conditions.\u201d\nBoeing\n, which decamped for\nNorthern Virginia\nin 2022, is selling only the building\u2019s leasehold interest. The land underneath is owned separately by the New York-based Stahl Organization under a 99-year ground lease that runs until 2084. Stahl refinanced its ground position with a $40 million loan in 2021, layering on another complication for any buyer hoping to make the numbers work.\nPeople familiar with the negotiations told the outlet that Hines could try to partner with Stahl or strike a buyout to reunify the building and land, an approach that would make financing easier. Without that, the developer would need to generate enough rental income to cover escalating ground-lease payments on top of building operations and any upgrades.\nHere Technologies\nanchors the building with nearly 118,000 square feet, and Boeing still uses space in the building.\nIn a sign that Boeing is preparing for a sale, the company recently executed a memorandum of lease for three mid-rise floors spanning about 70,000 square feet, securing expansion rights, signage controls and restrictions on leasing to certain competitors or foreign government entities. Its lease runs from 2026 through 2032 with extension options.\nHines has spent decades shaping the riverfront, most recently with the 60-story\nSalesforce Tower\njust down the river. Although 100 North Riverside is more than 30 years old, brokers are betting a deep-pocketed owner willing to renovate could still capture tenants hunting for high-end space in a market short on true Class A properties.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Sixth Street completed the acquisition in partnership with Riller Capital.\nThe deal works out to $280,487 per key, making it the\nmost-expensive hotel transaction\nof the year so far, outdoing Park Hotels &amp; Resorts\u2019 sale of the 315-room Hyatt Centric Fisherman\u2019s Wharf in May for $80 million, or $253,000 per key.\nThe hotel sits in the middle of South of Market and features 8,700 square feet of flexible meeting space, two food and beverage spots and parking spaces for 140 vehicles. The rooms underwent renovations in 2020.\nSixth Street bought the hotel in anticipation of a comeback in the San Francisco lodging market, especially with the increasing presence of artificial intelligence and tech firms moving in. The\ngrowth of AI firms\nhas helped create \u201cstrong tenant demand\u201d for lodging in downtown, said Marcos Alvarado, partner and head of U.S. real estate at Sixth Street.\nAnother deal is expected to take the top spot soon.\nNewbond and Conversant are nearing completion of their court-approved purchase of the nearly 3,000-room\nHilton San Francisco Union Square and Parc 55 hotel complex\nfor about $415 million, or $140,917 per key.

        "content": "One of the biggest land listings in the Adirondacks is back on the market after a Texas developer backed out of an eye-popping deal for the property.\nTodd Interests walked away from its\n$125 million contract\nfor the 36,600-acre Whitney Park estate, citing a hard stop in the late owner\u2019s will that forbids selling the land to New York State, the Adirondack Explorer\nreported\n. The collapse ends what had briefly looked like a breakthrough.\nIn recent weeks, the Dallas-based developer floated a 200-year lease of roughly 32,000 acres to the state as a workaround to the terms put forth by John Hendrickson\u2019s estate. Hendrickson barred state ownership after blaming Albany\u2019s management of a previous land sale for wiping out native trout in Little Tupper Lake.\nTodd Interests said Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s administration rejected the lease, insisting instead on\noutright acquisition\n. That impasse killed the deal.\n\u201cThis seems to be an unsolvable challenge,\u201d Shawn Todd told the outlet, saying the company couldn\u2019t deliver the state a fee-simple purchase without violating the seller\u2019s instructions. Trustee Edward Hendrickson confirmed that the developer had pulled out, putting the coveted tract back on the market at its full asking price.\nThe breakdown marks Todd Interests\u2019 second retreat in a deal tied to the Whitney estate. Weeks earlier, the firm abandoned its $12.9 million option on Cady Hill, the Saratoga Springs mansion owned by John Hendrickson and his late wife, socialite Marylou Whitney. At the time, Todd said Whitney Park remained the firm\u2019s priority.\nThe will\u2019s prohibition on selling to the state \u2014 long seen as the likeliest steward for a parcel that includes more than 6,000 acres of ponds and lakes and nearly 5,000 acres of wetlands \u2014 set up a difficult dance.\nConservation groups told Todd they oppose long-term leasing, arguing only state or nonprofit ownership ensures permanent protections. Meanwhile, the developer learned late in the process that some lawyers viewed the restriction as binding only on the trustees, not future buyers, an interpretation the estate disputes.\nFor Long Lake, a town of fewer than 800 residents, the stakes are high. Net proceeds from a sale are earmarked entirely for the municipality, potentially delivering a windfall several times its annual budget.\nThe trustees say they remain committed to maximizing value while protecting the property\u2019s legacy, but that the ban on state acquisition is non-negotiable.\nThat leaves one of the Adirondacks\u2019 crown jewels \u2014 larger than Manhattan and anchored by the historic, 17-bedroom Camp Deerlands \u2014 in search of a deep-pocketed buyer willing to navigate a conservation minefield.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The building will have about 18,841 square feet of ground-floor retail space.\nThe project, called Portico, represents the first phase of Mosaic, the 14-acre redevelopment of the defunct City Place mall. The property\u2019s previous owner, Shooshani Developers, defaulted on a $63 million linked to the property in 2020. Turnbridge Equities, Waterford Property Company and Monument Square Investment Group took ownership the following year.\nThe three entities still plan to move forward with most of the\nMosaic redevelopment\n. The project calls for 900 multifamily units and 38,000 square feet of commercial space. The group\nsold the Portico parcel of the property to JPI\nlast year for $14.7 million. JPI previously referred to the location as Jefferson Long Beach. Construction on Portico is expected to be completed in 2028.\nRetail repositioning abounds in Long Beach.\nLast month, CenterCal Properties and DRA Properties\nbought Long Beach Towne Center\nfor $145 million. The 870,000-square-foot mall is located about 10 miles northeast of the Mosaic site. The seller, Vestar, developed the center in 1999.

Newmark\u2019s Jared Horowitz and Hal Stein represented GFI.\nThe building has been home to several big lease deals this year. In April, telecommunications service provider MetTel expanded to 69,000 square feet. Two months later, engineering consultancy firm Jaros, Baum &amp; Bolles signed on for 68,000 square feet. In October, transportation technology firm Verra Mobility signed a 57,000-square-foot sublease from EmblemHealth.\nDowntown is slowly clawing its way back from the pandemic, well behind the surging Midtown and Midtown South markets.

        "content": "Russell Galbut footed the bill for digital ads that recently popped in New York City\u2019s Time Square, aimed at New Yorkers seeking to flee the upcoming mayoral reign of Zohran Mamdani.\nGalbut, co-founder of Miami-based\nCrescent Heights\n, paid for the billboards that featured a Miami Beach lifeguard stand with a message from the city\u2019s reelected mayor, Steven Meiner, the\nMiami Herald\nreported.\nThe ad said: \u201cMiami Beach is open for business. Everyone welcomed! Mayor\nSteven Meiner\n.\u201d\nOn Thursday, Meiner posted images of the ads on his Instagram account with the following caption, \u201cNew Yorkers: look up \u2026 Miami Beach is open for business. A world-class destination to live, work, and invest capital!\u201d\nGalbut told the Miami Herald that he suggested the ad campaign to Meiner in response to\nMamdani\u2019s\nNov. 4 victory over Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa. That same day,\nMeiner\nwon a second term as mayor, beating city commissioner Kristen Rosen Gonzalez.\n\u201cIt cost a little bit of money, but it\u2019s worth it because it\u2019s ridiculous what\u2019s happening in New York,\u201d Galbut said. \u201cI just think that this is such a unique opportunity for South Florida.\u201d\nGalbut said the ads flashed in Times Square over the course of two days last week, but he declined to say how much the billboards cost.\nGalbut joins other South Florida developers who are swooning over the possibility that Mamdani, a Democratic socialist who campaigned on enacting rent freezes for rent-stabilized buildings and other progressive ideas, is going to drive an exodus of wealthy New Yorkers to South Florida.\nDuring a panel at\nThe Real Deal Miami Real Estate Forum\nthis month, developer Kevin Maloney said, \u201cMamdani, I think, is probably going to end the city.\u201d Fellow panelists Ugo Colombo and Camilo Miguel Jr. said Mamdani\u2019s win has already sparked a fresh wave of interest from New York buyers, but they do not think South Florida will experience a Covid-level migration because of Mamdani.\nOther prominent real estate players have offered a more tepid reaction to Mamdani\u2019s victory, including Galbut\u2019s Crescent Heights partner and Manhattan resident, Bruce Menin. During the Miami forum\u2019s multifamily panel,\nMenin\nsaid, \u201cI think we have to take a little bit of a wait and see.\u201d\nAnd in another panel discussion at the event, about foreign buyers, ISG World\u2019s\nCraig Studnicky\nalso downplayed any significant impact of another potential New York-to-Miami migration. \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot of people say we\u2019re going to get this huge wave of people from New York, and I think the comparable in their heads or in their hearts is what happened five years ago during Covid,\u201d Studnicky said. \u201cSlow down. You\u2019re going to get a bump. But I think you\u2019re exaggerating the bump.\u201d\n\u2013 Francisco Alvarado",

        "content": "When the city began its search for developers of a site in the Meatpacking District, the request for proposals encouraged inclusion of an \u201cemerging developer.\u201d\nSuch a developer, the RFP described, had completed fewer than 10 projects in the past decade, each with fewer than 150 residential units, no more than 100,000 square feet and a cost below $30 million.\nStill, the developer couldn\u2019t be completely green; they needed some experience finishing projects in New York City or other urban areas.\nAn emerging developer wasn\u2019t a requirement of the project application, but prioritizing a more diverse applicant pool was part of the city\u2019s commitment, according to the RFP, to \u201creduce the barriers to entry into the real estate community.\u201d More than 10 teams applied for the project, part of a development dubbed Gansevoort Square, according to the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation.\nThe EDC\nselected\nKinwood Partners alongside Douglaston Development to build 590 housing units on a city-owned site. Kinwood would seem to fit the bill. The firm hasn\u2019t developed anything, but it is led by someone who spent a decade working for a major real estate investment trust as well as on projects in the neighborhood.\nDavid Himmel, former chief operating officer at Jamestown and son of Leslie Wohlman Himmel, co-founder of investment firm Himmel &amp; Meringoff Properties, is Kinwood\u2019s founder. His firm\u2019s selection has raised questions about the intent of designations like \u201cemerging developer\u201d in public-private endeavors\nThat\u2019s because while Himmel fits the criteria on paper, he\u2019s also a real estate scion who already held an executive role at a multi-billion-dollar REIT.\n\u201cIt makes a mockery of the whole thing,\u201d said Alicia Glen, founder of the development firm MSquared, which did not bid on the project.\nGlen, who served as deputy mayor for housing and economic development under Mayor Bill de Blasio, called the decision \u201cappalling and disgraceful.\u201d She said this classification is intended to support companies that wouldn\u2019t otherwise have access to the types of resources necessary to take on a major development project.\nThe timing also troubles Glen, given the federal government\u2019s\ncrackdown\non diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. She said New York City should be doing everything it can to be a counterweight to those efforts.\n\u201cAs a former government official and a feminist, this is disgusting,\u201d she said.\nHimmel formed \u201cDavid Himmel Development\u201d in April but changed the name and registered with the state in October as Kinwood. It\u2019s unclear if the company was formed expressly for bidding on the project, though the firm launched the same month the bid was due.\n\u201cDavid and Kinwood bring exactly what we need in partners for projects like Gansevoort Square,\u201d Steven Charno, president of Douglaston, said in a statement. He pointed to Himmel\u2019s experience at Jamestown and his previous work in the Meatpacking District.\n\u201cHis expertise with local community organizations made our proposal stronger, and we\u2019re excited about what we\u2019re building together for New Yorkers,\u201d he said.\nAs a firm just starting out, getting development work can be a catch-22: You need experience to get work, but you can\u2019t get work because you don\u2019t have experience. Even an \u201cemerging developer,\u201d by the city\u2019s definition, needs to have some experience. The criteria for this designation, though, doesn\u2019t factor in existing industry connections and to what extent having them can break down barriers to entry.\nAnother affordable housing developer, who also did not respond to the RFP, said Himmel\u2019s company \u201cfits the letter of the emergent developer guidelines but not the spirit.\u201d The developer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said designations are intended to lift up a developer from an underrepresented background, a nonprofit and/or a minority- or women-owned business.\n\u201cThis is the equivalent of Eric Trump leaving the family firm and forming a new company and calling it an emerging developer,\u201d the developer said.\n(Himmel has never worked for his mother\u2019s firm. Through a spokesperson, Leslie Himmel declined to comment.)\nEDC in January issued an RFP seeking developers for a 10,000-square-foot lot at the corner of Little West 12th Street and 10th Avenue in the Meatpacking District. The agency announced last month that Douglaston and Kinwood would build the residential building at the site, formerly home to the Gansevoort Meat Market. Up to 55 percent of the apartments will be set aside as affordable, and the developers have indicated that they will not require city funds, though they intend to apply for the property tax break 485x.\n\u201cThe proposal not only meets but exceeds the number of permanently affordable homes targeted in the RFP as well as other critical criteria laid out from the very beginning \u2014 all without public subsidy,\u201d an EDC spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cAt a time when Manhattan needs more affordable housing, this proposal will deliver it and further cement Meatpacking as a vibrant economic and cultural corridor.\u201d\nThe project is part of a broader redevelopment plan that includes expanding the Whitney Museum. EDC estimates that the plan will create 3,700 construction jobs, 160 permanent positions and have a $1.1 billion economic impact.\nDouglaston is a veteran affordable housing developer and brought on Kinwood, in part, because of its leader\u2019s experience in the neighborhood. Himmel worked on the Chelsea Market, Milk Studios and Pier 57 while at Jamestown, where he started as an analyst and worked his way up to the C-suite. He also overlapped for some years with Andrew Kimball, who now heads the EDC, though it doesn\u2019t appear that they worked together.\nThough the Gansevoort Square RFP did not require an emerging developer, the inclusion of one could give bidders an edge. Separately, the RFP included goals for hiring minority- and women-owned businesses: At least 25 percent of the project\u2019s hard and soft costs should go toward paying M/WBE contractors, subcontractors and suppliers.\nAs is\ntypical\nwith city and state projects, the goals are not mandates, but project teams have to show that they\u2019ve made a \u201cgood faith effort\u201d to meet the minimums. Such goals are, in part, an acknowledgement of the barriers to entry in real estate development, an industry that is capital-intensive, high-risk, reliant on relationships and traditionally white and male-dominated.\nThe \u201cemerging developer\u201d designation in the RFP is separate from EDC\u2019s emerging developer loan fund, which is not being used by Kinwood.\nMonadnock Development\u2019s Kirk Goodrich, who was unfamiliar with the city\u2019s selection on the Meatpacking project, said that, generally speaking, emerging developers should be those who have some level of experience but need institutional support. In other words, someone who would be a developer on their own \u201cbut for opportunity and capital.\u201d\n\u201cThe perfect situation, in my estimation, is: an individual who has toiled in the world of development,\u201d he said. \u201cCould be a lawyer, could be working for a bank, could be working for a nonprofit or nonprofit\ndeveloper, who never really had the family money or personal capital but has a solid knowledge base and has executed some of these things.\u201d\nSomeone with no related experience, by contrast, won\u2019t be able to learn and grow as effectively, he said.\n\u201cYou also don\u2019t want a situation where someone says they are a developer, but have no ability to carry out the core functions of the thing they say they are.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Another bank has joined the hunt for\nembattled multifamily investor\nJon Venetos.\nVista Bank sued the founder of Dallas-based Lurin Capital, claiming he personally guaranteed a $10.3 million loan Vista provided for the purchase of a Fort Worth apartment complex, according to a Nov. 7 filing in Dallas County District Court.\nVista took control of The Nolan, a 100-unit property at 6629 South Hulen Street, at a foreclosure sale via a $6.7 million credit bid after Lurin defaulted on the loan, Vista claims. Lurin still owes Vista $3 million \u2014 the remaining debt plus property taxes, interest, foreclosure costs and attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 the bank alleges.\nVista is the second bank to take legal action against Venetos for debt remaining after the foreclosure process.\nAcore claims Venetos personally guaranteed a $394.4 million loan tied to properties in Florida and Texas. The 12 Florida properties\nheaded to foreclosure\nauction in April. The lender filed six lawsuits in October\nasking for judgments totaling $80.7 million\n, Venetos\u2019 payment guaranties, plus other default-related expenses, court records show.\nVenetos is also fighting\nlawsuits from Fannie Mae\naccusing him of defaulting on a $77.2 million loan tied to a Houston apartment complex and from\nSelect Securities Europe\n, a lender from Luxembourg that claims he defaulted on 15 loans totaling $40.5 million.\nThe properties remaining in Lurin\u2019s portfolio are in trouble, too.\nJudge Bryan Gantt granted the city of Plano a temporary restraining order against Lurin on Oct. 27 and\nordered residents of Evana Grove Apartments to vacate\ndue to unsafe conditions.\nAccording to the filing, residents of the complex at 3500 Hillridge Drive didn\u2019t have access to water, sewer or gas \u2014 even though the property had racked up 1,459 code violations and ownership and management of Evana Grove was on the receiving end of nearly 100 lawsuits over conditions at the property.\nVenetos and his wife Ashley launched Lurin Capital in 2016 amid a wave of upstart real estate operators who planned to make money by purchasing Class B apartment complexes, updating them, raising rents and selling them at a profit.\nLurin\u2019s website says the firm owns 46 properties across five states, but the list includes assets that were handed back to lenders\nInterest rates complicated the strategy for many of them, increasing debt service on their floating-rate loans and raising construction costs. At the same time, Texas, a hotspot for value-add multifamily operators, was absorbing a historic wave of apartment development, causing rental rates and occupancy levels to fall.\nAs a result, experts anticipate\na wave of multifamily distress in Texas\n, where about $19 billion in CMBS loans tied to multifamily is set to mature in the next five years.\n",

The second is a proposed 13-story building containing 268 units across 249,000 square feet at 15 Oak Street. The two projects are located on the same lot, according to city records. The project will also include 82 enclosed parking spaces, according to the filing.\nSLCE Architects filed the permit applications. TF Cornerstone executive vice president Bruce Weill was listed as the owner on the documentation.\nTF Cornerstone didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. The firm, run by the Elghanayan family, is known as one of the largest luxury\nresidential developers in Long Island City\n.\nIt\u2019s unclear if the project plans to deliver condos or rentals.\nThe firm\npurchased the site for $175 million\nfrom entities connected to Jack Guttman in August of 2024,\nThe Real Deal\nreported at the time. Guttman\u2019s Pearl Realty Management purchased the site for $24 million in 2001, when it was the home of a twine manufacturing facility. The property was significantly damaged by what authorities determined to be arson in 2006.\nThe neighborhood has seen a crush of residential development in recent years. The largest currently underway is\nGreenpoint Landing\n, where the Domain Companies, LMXD and Park Tower have proposed 1,000 units, 20,000 square feet of retail and a public park.

Previous tax abatement programs had no wage requirement for multifamily rental construction.\nThe smaller building is targeting a zoning program that allows for a slight increase in density for energy-efficient developments.

        "content": "Riviera Beach approved a deal with New York-based Exact Capital to enable it to build 280 apartments in the city, most of which will be workforce and affordable housing.\nThe development agreement, which includes the sale of a half-acre property owned by the Riviera Beach Community Redevelopment Agency for $2 million, was approved by a vote of 4 to 1 during the CRA\u2019s meeting last week. Vice Council Chairperson KaShamba Miller-Anderson was the lone dissenting vote.\nAccording to the agreement, an affiliate of Exact Capital plans to build an 18-story, 192-unit mixed-income building with 7,000 square feet of commercial space at 2600 Broadway, and an eight-story, 88-unit affordable housing building for senior citizens, plus 2,000 square feet of commercial space, across the street at 2601 Broadway. Both projects would be managed by the Riviera Beach Housing Authority, a partner in the project.\nExact Capital\u2019s project, called The Riviera Gateway, will be built on properties that Riviera Beach\u2019s CRA paid nearly $2.8 million to acquire. Records show the CRA bought the 2600 Broadway parcel from Broadway &amp; Blue Heron Realty LLC, managed by Robert Sullivan, for nearly $2.3 million in 2018, and it bought the 2601 Broadway property for $500,000 in 2013.\nExact Capital will get the property at 2601 Broadway property for no cost, and will get a 100 percent property tax exemption in exchange for building affordable housing for seniors.\nThe developer will pay $500,000 upfront for the property at 2600 Broadway, and will pay $1.5 million once the project receives financing, including a $250,000 contribution to North Technical Education Center to support vocational training, Craig Livingston, managing partner of Exact Capital, told council members. There would also be a 50 percent tax exemption on the land for the first five years, which would decrease by 2.5 percent each for the next 30 years.\nThe terms of the deal initially concerned some council members. Council Chairperson Shirley Lanier said she didn\u2019t like the idea of the developer gaining control of the property before gaining financing, while council member Bruce Guyton wanted to make sure the city would get a return on the land.\n\u201cWe are not in the business of giving away properties to developers, even in P3s. We need something coming back to us,\u201d Guyton said.\nLivingston replied that even with the tax abatement, Riviera Gateway would pay $5 million in property taxes in the first years and a total of $25 million over 30 years. \u201cWe\u2019re going to produce affordable housing. We are creating a tremendous [number] of jobs. We are going to invest almost $200 million in this location that will, particularly on the east side, be generating a tremendous amount of tax revenue for the city,\u201d Livingston added.\nWorkforce housing developer Terry Booty, who called himself an unpaid consultant for Exact Capital and the Housing Authority, said that if they don\u2019t go forward with the project as promised, the CRA can take back the land through the agreement\u2019s \u201ccall back provisions.\u201d\nRiviera Beach has attracted increased attention from developers in recent months. An analysis by\nThe Real Deal\nrevealed nearly 2,000 condos and apartments are in Riviera Beach\u2019s\nresidential development pipeline\n.\nSeveral of these future developments are slated to be built on or near the U.S. 1/Broadway corridor, such as Boca Raton-based\nSobelCo\u2019s 508-unit, 1.2 million-square-foot 1117 Broadway\nproject, and North Palm Beach-based Forest Development\u2019s two\n25-story Oculina condo towers\nat 3700 Broadway. Forest Development, headed by Peter Baytarian, has also recently inked a deal to acquire 2.2 acres of Riviera Beach-owned property at 1851 Broadway for a\n$325 million project near Riveria Beach\u2019s waterfront\n.\nAnd the Related Group recently obtained $100 million in financing to build a 149-unit workforce housing development called\nResidences at Riviera Beach\nat 57 East 12th Street, which will be built next door\nto Related\u2019s joint venture 20-story development\n, Gallery at Riviera Beach, at 1300 Broadway.",

Estate sites have drawn early interest prompting a targeted release next spring, Craig told the outlet.\nLot deliveries to builders are expected before the end of next year, and Craig estimates Preston Harbor could ultimately support up to 10,000 homes. Apartments will play a supporting role with fewer than 1,500 planned.\nThe lake is the star attraction \u2014 Preston Harbor controls 9.5 miles of shoreline \u2014 but the northward push isn\u2019t just about water views.\nMoayedi pointed to billions of dollars in semiconductor investment from\nTexas Instruments\nand\nGlobalWafers\nin nearby Sherman, which has pulled residential demand into far-flung pockets of Grayson County.\nCenturion is already active nearby, including its massive\nCottonwood\nmixed-use community outside Dorchester. Production homebuilders like Lennar and D.R. Horton are following suit, he said.\nInfrastructure is lining up to match the ambition. A key arterial road funded through escrow is slated to start construction shortly after Thanksgiving, taking roughly a year to complete.\nThat roadway unlocks the project\u2019s two anchors: a planned\nMargaritaville\nresort and a 900-slip marina. Phoenix Hospitality is leading the resort, whose first phase \u2014 a 150-room hotel paired with restaurants, entertainment and 50 bungalows \u2014 would take 12 to 18 months to build once the road is finished, the developer said.\nCraig added that Waterfall Partners is in talks with a major marina operator for a ground lease and is exploring a medical clinic with Texoma Medical and Community Hospital Corporation.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Houston\u2019s most-expensive home sale last month was a Memorial Villages house that went to local restaurateur Kelly Barnhart.\nThe proprietor of Vibrant, a trendy Montrose-area eatery, bought 302 Timberwilde Lane on Oct. 31, according to county records. With an asking price of $8.25 million, the 7,400-square-foot house was the city\u2019s most expensive listing to go under contract in October, according to the Houston Association of Realtors. The asking price amounted to $1,115 per square foot.\nThe property sold in just a month, almost two weeks faster than the average days on market for Houston luxury, according to\nRedfin\n. William Wheless of Wheless Realty had the listing.\nThe 2.7-acre lot has a tennis court, a golfing green and a pool alongside a 1956-built home with five bedrooms and six bathrooms. The listing beckoned investors with the home\u2019s teardown potential, but Barnhart may prefer to keep it; her restaurant is in a\nrenovated building\n.\nThe home wasn\u2019t just the most expensive sale in October; it was also the\noldest\nof the top 10, beating out two spec mansions.\nThe youngest home on the list, 46 Aria Isle Drive in The Woodlands, was finished earlier this year by custom luxury builder John Post Homes, which was asking $5.5 million when John Wisenbaker bought it on Oct. 17, or about $600 for each of the home\u2019s 9,100 square feet.\nAnother spec mansion, 606 Pinehaven Drive in Houston, sold to a trust connected to\nHouston Rockets\nplayer Jabari Smith Jr. Rich Strike Holdings, a company owned by local luxury builder Justin Talasek, sold 606 Pinehaven to the King Family Trust, a legal entity managed by Taneskia Purnell, Smith\u2019s mother. The 7,700-square-foot-home home was asking $5.2 million when it sold, about $680 per square foot.\nFinal sales prices aren\u2019t available, but the spec mansions cut their asking prices before selling, according to Zillow.\nJohn Post Homes originally listed 46 Aria Isle last August for $5.75 million, and Rich Strike Holdings asked $5.35 million for 606 Pinehaven after construction was finished.\nThe luxury market is slowing across the Sun Belt, but Houston is experiencing a K-shaped market, with top-tier homes growing in value while lower-tier homes depreciate.\nThe median sale price of Houston luxury grew 4 percent year over year in September, according to\nRedfin\n. The average luxury home sold in 43 days in Houston, significantly faster than the national luxury average of 52 days.\nAs luxury homes appreciated, the overall Houston median home price decreased by 1.5 percent in the same period, according to\nHomes.com\n, the widest drop in the country, tied with Austin.\nIn addition, the mean asking price of last month\u2019s top 10 sales was $6.1 million, up from $5.8 million last October and $4.3 million in October 2023, according to HAR.\nEven so, luxury sellers are still adjusting to the reality of reduced negotiating power compared to previous years. Six of the top 10 luxury sales last month had price cuts.\n",

        "content": "In two weeks, possibly sooner, we will know where new casinos will rise in New York City. It seems one proposal just dodged a speedbump.\nOn Friday, a state Supreme Court judge temporarily barred the city from inking a new lease with Steve Cohen that would allow his development to be built on Citi Field\u2019s parking lots. Such a deal would be necessary to pave the way for his $8 billion casino complex next to Citi Field, dubbed Metropolitan Park, if the state decides to award him a license.\nThe order specified that an agreement with the city and Steve Cohen couldn\u2019t move forward until the city established that the deal would maintain the rights of the U.S. Tennis Association National Tennis Center under its lease with the city. More specifically, the USTA wanted to ensure that its rights would take precedent \u2014\u00a0through a \u201csuperiority clause\u201d \u2014\u00a0over the new agreement.\nThe judge\u2019s decision came after the USTA filed a lawsuit last week, alleging that the city \u201crefused\u201d to guarantee that the superiority clause would be included in the new agreement with Cohen and that it would respect the association\u2019s lease rights. Those rights, according to the lawsuit, include ensuring that competing events (aside from baseball) are not held during the three weeks of the U.S. Open and that at least 2,920 parking spaces are available for the tennis tournament\u2019s spectators at Citi Field.\nBut the city and Queens Future (the entity tied to Cohen and the rest of the casino team) reached a new agreement on Monday. A spokesperson for the casino team confirmed that the deal complied with Friday\u2019s order because it included the superiority clause.\n\u201cAfter months of discussion, the city and Queens Future have reached an agreement with respect to the Metropolitan Park project that complies with a recent court order and reflects the U.S. Tennis Association\u2019s rights,\u201d a City Hall spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to the advancement of a world-class casino that would create thousands of union-paying jobs, billions of dollars in economic impact, and improvements to local communities.\u201d\nThe casino, if ultimately approved, will take the place of 50 acres of underutilized parking lots next to Citi Field. The project will ultimately have more parking than the current facility, so that appears to be less of an issue with USTA than the \u201ccompeting events\u201d held during the U.S. Open. The casino complex is expected to include a 5,650-seat entertainment venue. A rep for Metropolitan Park indicated that the development team was still exploring options related to events held during the U.S. Open. So, this may be an ongoing issue.\nOn Monday, though, USTA seemed content with the city\u2019s agreement.\n\u201cWe are thankful that the court honored our request and that the city has complied by adding the required language to its lease with Queens Future, which now acknowledges protections during the three weeks of the US Open,\u201d a spokesperson for USTA said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to welcoming the casino as our newest neighbor in Flushing Meadow-Corona Park.\u201d\nMembers of the state\u2019s Gaming Facility Location Board on Monday toured the three sites that are competing for state licenses. The board is expected to award up to three licenses before Dec. 1.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWho will lead the city\u2019s housing-related agencies under the Mamdani administration? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: New Rochelle just released two new tools for tracking storefronts and key metrics, such as the number of residential units downtown.\nThe\nLiveXYZ Storefront Map &amp; Directory\nfeatures an interactive map that shows what businesses occupy storefronts downtown, as well as which locations are vacant. The\nNew Rochelle Downtown Vanguard Dashboard\nshows downtown\u2019s population growth since 2016, the number of residential units built in that time and the number of businesses that have opened in the past few years.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Council member Chi Oss\u00e9 on Monday created a campaign committee to challenge House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries next year,\nPolitico New York reports\n. This is his first official step toward challenging Jeffries, though he maintained Monday that he is still \u201cexploring\u201d a run. \u201cThe Democratic Party\u2019s leadership is not only failing to effectively fight back against Donald Trump, they have also failed to deliver a vision that we can all believe in. These failures are some of the many reasons why I am currently exploring a potential run for New York\u2019s 8th Congressional District,\u201d Oss\u00e9 said in a statement Monday. Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has tried to dissuade Oss\u00e9 from primarying Jeffries.\n\u2014 Gov. Kathy Hochul hopes that business leaders can convince President Donald Trump not to deploy National Guard troops in New York,\nGothamist reports\n. \u201cI\u2019ve had conversations with a lot of business leaders saying, \u2018When the time comes, make sure that you also convey your concerns about what this would do to destabilize New York City and the outsize impact that this would have across America,\u2019\u201d Hochul told reporters on Monday. \u201cIt would have an effect that other cities do not have because we are the financial center. And you cannot disturb that without consequences.\u201d\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$44.9 million\nfor a condominium unit at 50 West 66th Street on the Upper West Side.

The total was down from the previous week, which saw\n27 contracts signed for $80 million\n.\nThe priciest property to snag a signed contract was a historic mansion on a sprawling plot of land south of Prospect Park.\nBuilt in 1904, the 5,000-square-foot home on 1221\nAlbemarle Road\nscored a contract with a last asking price of $6 million, according to Compass\u2019 weekly report. The house sits on a corner parcel of land with a 67-foot-wide front yard, a private driveway and a two-car garage.\nThe six-bedroom and three-bathroom home has been restored and renovated to keep original details like its parquet floors, decorative moldings, central staircase and stained-glass windows.\nThe chef\u2019s kitchen features custom oak cabinetry, Calacatta marble countertops and a farm sink with unlacquered brass fixtures. The primary suite holds a seating area, walk-in closet and a skylit bathroom with marble double vanity, windowed shower clad in handmade tile, a soaking and a custom sauna.\nThere is also an irrigated side yard with fruit, vegetable and herb beds. The home was last sold for $2.4 million in 2019.\nCompass\u2019 Laura Rozos had the listing.\nThe second priciest contract signed was for a townhouse at 532 Clinton Street in Carroll Gardens, asking $5.25 million.\nThe gut-renovated home spans 3,600 square feet and features four beds and four full bathrooms.\nThe garden floor has a windowed den with full-height glass sliding doors that lead into the back garden. The primary suite fills the entire top floor, with floor-to-ceiling windows, a walk-in closet and an ensuite bathroom with dual vanities, a freestanding soaking tub and a glass-enclosed shower.\nThe home also has a finished roof deck with views of the Statue of Liberty.\nReal estate investor Jawad Lakhani bought the home for $2.4 million last year, according to public records.\nCompass\u2019 Tamara Abir, Noah Plener and Sarah Slavin of the Tamara and Noah Team had the listing.\n",

The homes that went pending last week total $235 million in asking dollar volume and averaged 105 days on the market.\nThe previous week\n, buyers signed 10 contracts totaling $67.7 million in asking dollar volume.\nThe report tracks signed contracts for single-family homes and condos asking $3 million or more in the Beaches MLS. It identified 63 new listings, and a total of 1,181 active listings on the market.\nOf the properties that went pending last week, 23 were single-family homes and six were condos. The average asking price for the condos is $3.8 million, or $1,260 per square foot. They spent an average of 136 days on the market.\nThe average asking price for the single-family homes is $9.2 million, and they spent an average of 74 days on the market.\nThe most expensive home to find a buyer last week is the 17,100-square-foot megamansion at 16101 Quiet Vista Circle, asking $47.5 million. It is in the gated Stone Creek Ranch community, where\nMark Wahlberg\nrecently bought a mansion for $32.6 million. Records show the seller is car dealer Dan Dagesse, the chairman of Norwood, Massachusetts-based DCD Automotive Holdings, which is the parent company of Nucar, a car dealership network with more than 30 locations across New England, the Mid-Atlantic region and Pennsylvania.\nDagesse bought the 2.5-acre property for $2 million in 2018, records show. He completed the compound in 2023 with a team that included AK Build &amp; Design, Brenner Architectural Group and Michael Gray Interiors. It includes a main house with seven bedrooms, nine bathrooms, two half-bathrooms, spa facilities, a gym, a putting green, a tennis court, a club room with storage and a two-lane bowling alley and a two-level pool, the listing shows.\nDagesse listed the home for $47.5 million in May, Zillow shows. Colleen Nouhan with Premier Estate Properties has the listing.\nThe next most expensive listing to go under contract last week was the 6,800-square-foot waterfront home at 631 Island Drive in Palm Beach, asking $37.5 million. Records show the sellers are Richard and Linda Schaps, who bought the home for $7.9 million in 2012. Richard Schaps is the founder of Van Wagner Group, one of the largest billboard and aerial advertising firms in the country. In 2014, he sold the billboard component of the business to\nCBS Outdoor for $690 million\n. The firm now focuses on sports and entertainment advertising, primarily at major sporting events like the Olympics, Super Bowl and college football playoffs.\nThe Schaps\u2019 home was built on half an acre in 1961, according to property records. The home has seven bedrooms, seven bathrooms, three half-bathrooms, 130 feet of direct water frontage and a dock, records and the listing show.\nIt hit the market for $40 million in February, Zillow shows.

        "content": "Los Angeles has emerged as one of the nation\u2019s hottest hubs for\nadaptive reuse\n, with 5,640 apartments in the pipeline \u2014 second only to\nManhattan\u2019s\n11,000, according to a recent analysis.\nOffice buildings comprise 50 percent of the main target for conversion in L.A., with 11 such projects in development as of July, RentCafe.com\ndetermined\nusing its Yardi Matrix data. They account for 2,843 apartments, roughly 50 percent of the city\u2019s adaptive reuse housing pipeline.\nL.A.-based\nJamison Services\nis responsible for the three largest\noffice-to-residential\nprojects:\n1055 West 7th Street\n, a 33-story office building downtown being redeveloped into 691 apartments; the L.A. Superior Court Tower at\n600 South Commonwealth\nAvenue, a 19-story building at the edge of Lafayette Park being converted into 428 live/work apartments; and an 18-story high-rise at 695 South Vermont Avenue in Koreatown, which will yield 255 apartments.\n\u201cThe beauty of adaptive reuse is you can build on it by right in Downtown L.A., and you don\u2019t have to deal with the affordable and some of the other stuff new development has to do,\u201d said CBRE\u2019s Phillip Sample, who is marketing for residential conversion Jamison\u2019s 811 Wilshire Boulevard, which is\nfacing foreclosure\n.\n\u201cSo if you can buy a building and get to the bones of the building without a whole bunch of tenant mix issues, in a year you could break ground on the building with full permits.\u201d\nBuilding out the interiors instead of erecting a ground-up development can cut costs and construction time.\nGround-up construction takes 18 to 24 months, said Kelly Farrell, a principal and head of the residential practice at Gensler. Conversions allow developers to \u201cbring buildings to market faster,\u201d she said.\nThe property at 811 Wilshire Boulevard is on the market with an asking price of $43 million, or $130 per square foot, Sample said. It includes a parking structure at 616 South Figueroa Street.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t build a building for $130 a foot,\u201d he said.\nThe landlord\ndefaulted\non debt connected to the 25-story, 337,000-square-foot building and a deal to sell it fell apart,\nThe Real Deal\nreported.\n\u201cThey are in a maturity default,\u201d Sample, a specialist in adaptive reuse, said. \u201cTheir loan came due. The owner has never missed any mortgage payment.\u201d\nJamison has converted seven Adaptive Reuse Ordinance projects totaling 1,500 units.\nJaime Lee, CEO of Jamison,\ntold The Real Deal\nin June that ground-up construction \u201cjust isn\u2019t penciling because of a myriad of factors, but the conversion still works really well.\u201d\nBefore the pandemic, developers built so much new office space that many older buildings are now underused and in need of repurposing, she said.\nConversions have become increasingly popular in L.A. since the city adopted its 1999 Adaptive Reuse Ordinance, which eased the process of turning historic or underused buildings into new uses, especially housing, followed by a revised version in 2024. And local leaders have promoted adaptive reuse as a means to help address L.A.\u2019s housing crisis.\nNationwide, there were 24,735 units developed from adaptive reuse projects last year, per\nRentCafe.com\n. Today there are roughly 181,000 apartments from adaptive reuse projects in various stages of development.\n\u201cJamison historically has a large office portfolio, a lot of it here in Los Angeles, so we\u2019ve been using the adaptive reuse ordinance to convert a lot of those now vacant or close-to-vacant buildings to residential apartments, because we all know housing is needed and office is not needed as much anymore,\u201d Lee\u2019s brother Garrett Lee, president of Jamison Properties, said on a July panel sponsored by\nTRD\n.\nAt the time, the firm had four such projects under construction with two slated for completion by the end of the year.\nFrom a financing standpoint, debt isn\u2019t a problem, Garrett Lee said \u2014 \u201cthere definitely are loans to be made.\u201d The real challenge, he added, is raising equity.\nNot all buildings are viable for conversion.\nA good candidate should have a floor-to-ceiling height of at least 9 feet for finished units and rectangular floor plates of about 8,000 square feet \u201cto ensure adequate efficiency,\u201d per information provided by CBRE. \u201cAdditionally, walkability and available on-site parking are significant advantages.\u201d\nAnjac Fashion Buildings, a real estate investment firm with a large downtown presence,\nconverted the upper floors\nof the historic Singer Building into luxury residences in 2021. With the garment business on the wane, the owner thought it made sense to convert the former sewing machine company warehouse into seven lofts of 6,000 square feet each.\n\u201cThe only reason why I was able to make it make sense is because it was something my father purchased back probably in the late 1960s,\u201d said Steve Needleman, chairman of Anjac Fashion Buildings, who is pessimistic about development in L.A. today.\nWhile it may not make sense financially to acquire office buildings \u201cfor the purpose of converting,\u201d Jaime Lee said, \u201cif you\u2019re an existing office holder\u201d it could be a good option.\n",

        "content": "A proposal to temporarily pause the mansion tax for property owners in the Pacific Palisades has new legs a month after Mayor Karen Bass first\nfloated the idea\nin a letter to the city council.\nOn Monday, the Ad Hoc Committee for LA Recovery approved a motion asking the City Attorney to report back in 30 days on the feasibility of the one-time carveout of the\nMeasure United to House L.A. tax\n. The update effectively pushes the issue into 2026, the earliest property owners could have clarity on the matter.\nThe proposal \u2014 if passed in any form \u2014 would be the first time a swing at getting the\ntax modified\nhas landed, and could spell implications for real estate dealmaking more broadly.\nVoters passed Measure ULA as a November 2022 ballot measure that applies a 4 percent tax on property sales starting at $5.3 million and 5.5 percent on trades of $10.6 million or more.\nSo far, the more than $880 million generated by the tax has been funneled to programs aimed at homelessness prevention, including eviction defense services and rental assistance, in addition to building affordable housing.\nWhile the commercial and residential industries have blamed the tiered tax for casting a pall on deal flow and development, ULA has more recently been singled out as a hurdle to getting the Palisades \u2014 a community that\u2019s part of the City of Los Angeles \u2014 rebuilt following January\u2019s Palisades Fire in which 5,500 residential buildings were destroyed in the community.\nCouncilmember and Ad Hoc Committee on LA Recovery chair Traci Park said during Monday\u2019s meeting she looked for possible ULA exemptions \u201cgiven that there were hundreds of millions of dollars in ULA revenue going unspent earlier this year.\u201d\n\u201cWe had had hoped to see some of those funds be made available to renters from the Pacific Palisades who lost their homes as a result of the fire as well as to workers who lost jobs as a result of the fire, but sadly and infuriatingly, really, we were advised on each of those occasions that citizen-driven initiatives like ULA can only be amended at the ballot box and not by council ordinance,\u201d Park said.\nThe expected revenue from ULA\u00a0 for the current fiscal year is about\n$425 million\n, with commercial properties\u2013which does not include multifamily or mixed-use properties,\u00a0 by the city\u2019s classifications\u2013generating the biggest slice of funding so far. The commercial sector generated $88.6 million in the current fiscal year, according to Los Angeles Housing Department data as of Nov. 12. Single-family homes brought in the next largest bucket of revenue with $58.2 million.\nBass\u2019 Oct. 9 request for a carveout would apply to\u00a0 single-family homes, condos and other residential properties affected\u00a0 by the fire. It\u2019s a one-time exemption, across three years that Bass is pushing in a bid to \u201ccreate more housing citywide,\u201d she said in her October letter to the city council.\nAmong the properties hit by January\u2019s fires, the city has so far issued permits for 526 unique addresses as of Monday, according to the Department of Building and Safety. Another 1,106 addresses have applications filed, while a little over 1,000 are in review.\n",

The lease has been extended through 2033 and is valued at approximately $15 million.\nThe building\u2019s landlord,\nBLT Enterprises\n, bought the property in 2022 from Montana Avenue Capital for $27.3 million.

The seller was Equity Residential; Berkadia issued a $19 million note.\nThe deal comes out to $365,000 per apartment for the 208-unit building.\nThe property, called the Eleve, includes about 14,000 square feet of fully leased ground floor retail and a 26,000 square foot skydeck. It is near billionaire Rick Caruso\u2019s Americana at Brand.\nEquity Residential purchased the seven-story property for $70.5 million, according to a 2014 annual report.\nBerkadia marketing materials pitched the property as a value-add investment opportunity, as the rents are lower than typical for downtown Glendale.\nThe buyer declined to comment; the seller and Berkadia did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe Glendale, Burbank and Pasadena multifamily submarket has a 95 percent occupancy rate, according to a Colliers analysis. The average rent is about $2,400 a month, and the average sale price per apartment is $390,000.\nThe \u200b\u200bMichael H. Saperstein Family Trust recently sold a Glendale multifamily property at 700 North Palm Drive for more than $6 million to an unknown buyer, and that deal came out to $450,000 per apartment,\naccording to\nKidder Mathews. It was one of the priciest-per-apartment trades in Glendale this year.\nThis summer, Amidi Group\nsold\na mid-rise apartment community in Glendale, at 111 North Louise Street, for $33.5 million, or about $508,000 an apartment, to Regent Properties.\nMultifamily owner Pacific Urban Investors has made a couple buys recently.\nThe company\npurchased\na rent-stabilized apartment building in Brooklyn, New York, for $83 million in July, marking its eighth purchase in the New York metropolitan area.\nPublicly traded Equity Residential has been selling.\nIn August, it\nsold\nan apartment complex in a Boston suburb for $97 million; in May, it\nsold\na Seattle multifamily property for $121 million.\n",

The home\u2019s\ncurrent owner, art collector Tina Trahan\n, is seeking historic designation for the property from the city with the support of preservationists.\nThe exterior of the house at 11222 Dilling Street was used in establishing shots during the iconic sitcom\u2019s run from 1969 to 1974. Tourists drive by today to take pictures and reminisce on the memories associated with the show.\nThe home was built in 1959 and chosen by producers for its location not far away from the studio where interior shots were filmed, as well as its classic midcentury look outside.\nIn 2019, HGTV bought the house for the series \u201cA Very Brady Renovation,\u201d which invited cast members from the show to help rebuild the inside of the house to resemble the studio sets that interior shots were filmed on. Show-accurate touches include an open, split-level staircase to the kitchen and orange Formica countertops.\nOnce the renovation series wrapped,\nHGTV sold\nthe house in 2023 to superfan Tina Trahan for $3.2 million. At the time, Trahan described the house as a must-buy, even if it might not make sense from an outside financial expert\u2019s perspective.\n\u201cWhen I was buying it, I wasn\u2019t thinking, \u2018Oh, it was a great investment,'\u201d Trahan\ntold\nPeople in 2023. \u201cWhen I buy art, it\u2019s because I love the art. It\u2019s not because, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to make money on this.\u2019 Because\u2026 if you\u2019re going to make money in art, you have to sell it. I buy art, and then I don\u2019t sell it.\u201d\nLos Angeles\u2019 Cultural Heritage Commission will send members to the property in the coming vote and later vote whether to recommend to the\nCity Council\nthat the property would be eligible for monument status. After that, the City Council will vote on whether to grant the designation. If approved, any major exterior alteration or proposal for demolition would trigger a review by city staff and the Cultural Heritage Commission.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9nde\n",

        "content": "A Colorado investor making big moves on the Magnificent Mile is zeroing in on a major Loop office tower that\u2019s staring down a ticking mortgage clock.\nReal Capital Solutions is in advanced talks to buy 311 West Monroe Street, the 390,000-square-foot building Chicago developer Sterling Bay has been shopping for months amid a fast-approaching payoff date on its debt, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n, citing sources familiar with the negotiations.\nReal Capital is already under contract to buy\n401 North Michigan\nafter offering more than $130 million.\nIts bid for the West Monroe building would deepen the bet that Chicago\u2019s office market is near a low point. Real Capital\u2019s bid is not a done-deal, as the firm recently agreed to buy\n190 South LaSalle\nbefore abandoning the offer.\nSterling Bay\u2019s urgency is clear.\nIt\nrefinanced\n311 West Monroe in early 2020 with an $82.5 million senior loan later sliced into Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities bonds. The maturity date was pushed from March to July this year, then to this month as Eastdil Secured\u2019s Bryan Rosenberg worked to find a buyer.\nComplicating matters is a $10 million guaranty tied to Sterling Bay Capital Partners II fund. If the building sells for less than the loan balance or defaults, the fund\u2019s investors are on the hook.\nThe scenario marks a dramatic reversal from\nSterling Bay\u2019s\npre-pandemic success with the property.\nThe firm bought the mostly vacant tower for $60 million in 2017, then poured $43.4 million into upgrades \u2014 new elevators, amenities and a lobby overhaul \u2014 setting off a leasing streak.\nHospitality firm Convene took 90,000 square feet in 2018, followed by Mayer Brown with 56,000. West Monroe Partners signed on for nearly 180,000 square feet in 2019, filling the last of the tower\u2019s vacancy and helping underpin a 2020 appraisal of $169 million.\nRising rates and the pandemic upended that equation, however. Even though the building is fully leased, Sterling Bay\u2019s floating-rate senior loan drove annual debt service above the building\u2019s cash flow in 2023 and 2024, according to Bloomberg. Last year the tower generated $7.4 million in net cash flow against $8.6 million in debt service.\nThat\u2019s where Real Capital sees opportunity. Long known for scooping up\ndistressed commercial properties\n, the firm has publicly committed $3.5 billion to office acquisitions over the next three years. With lengthy lease terms secured for West Monroe (through 2032) and Mayer Brown (through 2030), 311 West Monroe offers the kind of income durability sought after in a shaky market.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Marcus Lemonis\ntook a loss on his Streeterville condo, highlighting prolonged value erosion at the\nBloomingdale\u2019s building\n.\nThe Camping World co-founder and former CNBC personality sold his 4,800-square-foot, 21st-floor unit in September for $3.3 million, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. The deal works out to $689 per square foot.\nThe sale price is just below the $3.39 million he paid in 2020 but far off the nearly $5 million he sought when he first listed the condo two years ago.\nThe three-bedroom residence occupies part of a 200,000-square-foot slice of the Bloomingdale\u2019s building that\nJMB Realty\nbegan converting to residences from offices in the mid-2000s after advertising giant J. Walter Thompson exited.\nThe unit features floor-to-ceiling windows, dual dining areas, a split floorplan separating primary and guest wings, five distinct living areas as well as a kitchen stocked with high-end appliances. The home is on the southeast corner of the building and has lake views, as well as city views of Michigan Avenue and the river.\nLemonis\n, a reality TV star whose shows include \u201cThe Renovator,\u2019\u2019 first tried to sell in spring 2022, asking almost $5 million, but the listing fizzled.\nIt returned to market in August at $3.45 million, and less than two weeks later it was under contract.\nCity &amp; Field Real Estate\u2019s Joe Wright was the listing agent. Public filings show the recorded price at $3.3 million, with another $300,000 in personal property \u2014 probably furniture \u2014 tacked on. MLS records reflect a combined $3.6 million deal value. The buyer was identified only as a Miami Beach philanthropist.\nEven at the higher figure, the price continues a downward trajectory for the building. The condo\nfetched\n$4.75 million in 2010, meaning its former owners took a seven-figure loss when they sold to\nLemonis\nin 2020. The broader pattern at\n900 North Michigan\nis unmistakable: multiple units are trading at or below values last seen decades ago.\nThe tower\u2019s monthly HOA dues run $5,856, and the unit\u2019s tax bill came in at $58,990 last year \u2014 heavy carrying costs that may be contributing to the building\u2019s price compression as luxury buyers seek newer products along the Mag Mile and in nearby Gold Coast towers.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A mansion in Atherton just hit the market for the highest asking price in the tony Peninsula enclave so far this year.\nThe newly completed Villa Anahid at 349 Walsh Road is for sale for $57.5 million, the San Francisco Standard\nreported\n. The property spans a 13,000-square-foot residence and is named after the Persian goddess of water and light \u2014 fitting for a home complete with a waterfall and infinity pool.\nThe seller of the property is an unnamed LLC that bought the site in 2020 for $4.5 million, per PropertyShark records cited by the Standard. The owner bulldozed a smaller midcentury home on the property to erect the recently finished mansion. The new home is designed by Mike Khalesi of Beverly Hills One.\nThe house is listed for sale by Mary and Brent Gullixson of Compass, who earlier this year worked with billionaire tech investor Marc Andreessen to\nsell his 12,000-square-foot home\nin Atherton for $27 million, or 10 percent under listing price. Other high-profile Atherton residents both past and present include Golden State Warriors star Steph Curry,\nformer Google CEO Eric Schmidt\nand former Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg.\nAtherton has been home to the country\u2019s most expensive ZIP code for nearly a decade, but the Peninsula town recently lost its top spot to Miami Beach\u2019s Fisher Island. The median home sale price in Atherton for the first nine months of the year hit a record high of more than $8.3 million, compared with $9.5 million for Fisher Island.\nThe priciest sale in Atherton so far this year was a\n$52 million transaction\nfor the home of tech executive Stephen Luczo and his wife Agatha, founder of the Furtuna skincare company.\nEarlier this month, another luxury home in Atherton spanning 17,000 square feet\nhit the market for just shy of $50 million\n. The 1.4-acre estate at 88 Tuscaloosa Avenue, listed by Joe Piazza at Coldwell Banker Realty, is available for $49.9 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The average share of homes that have depreciated in the Texas Triangle \u2014 Dallas, Houston, Austin and San Antonio \u2014 is over 85 percent.\nAustin had the greatest drop in average home value among the top metros in the country since the last market peak. The former\ntech boomtown\n, which had meteoric growth during the pandemic, has suffered a 20 percent decline in home values, according to Zillow\u2019s Zestimate function.\nAustin, San Antonio and Dallas are also three of the top five cities with the largest share of listings priced below their last sale. San Francisco ranks first with 14 percent of homes valued below their most recent sale price, but Austin is close behind with 13 percent of homes. Eight percent of homes in San Antonio and 7 percent in Dallas have depreciated since their last sale.\nThe change in the market doesn\u2019t undo the growth of the last six years. In the context of the value surge that homeowners have enjoyed, this year\u2019s decline \u201cis a normalization, not a crash,\u201d Zillow analyst Treh Manhertz said.\n\u201cThe vast majority of homeowners still have significant equity,\u201d Manhertz said.\nThat\u2019s not the case for single-family investors who bought homes during or after the pandemic boom \u2014 sellers who make up a substantial share of the Texas market.\nThanks in large part to DFW,\nTexas had the highest rate of homes sold to institutional investors in 2021\n, drawing Wall Street attention to Tarrant and Rockwall Counties.\nIn Austin, where the share of investor-owned homes generally hovered under 20 percent,\ninvestors swelled to almost a third of the market\nduring the pandemic.\nSingle-family homes aren\u2019t the\ngolden goose they used to be\n. The market downturn is pitting professional landlords against \u201c\naccidental landlords,\n\u201d homeowners who are renting out their homes rather than attempting to sell.

        "content": "President Donald Trump, unsurprisingly, is picking a MAGA Republican to be the next Miami mayor. But real estate industry titans are circling the wagons for the moderate Democrat for the supposedly\nnon-partisan runoff\non Dec. 9.\nOver the weekend,\nTrump\n, whose presidential library could be built in downtown Miami, posted on Truth Social that he\u2019s endorsing Emilio Gonzalez, the former Miami city manager who successfully sued the city to keep this year\u2019s election on track.\nDespite misspelling Gonzalez\u2019s last name twice in his post, Trump lauded the ex-city top bureaucrat:\n\u201cAs Miami\u2019s next mayor, he will fight tirelessly to Grow the Economy, Cut Taxes and Regulations, Advance MADE IN THE U.S.A., Unleash American Energy DOMINANCE, Keep our now very secure border SECURE, Stop Migrant Crime and Defend our always under siege Second Amendment,\u201d Trump wrote.\nWhile none of those issues may be top of mind for most Miami residents, Trump\u2019s endorsement could help Gonzalez close the gap with voters, as he attempts to gain ground against Eileen Higgins, the former Miami-Dade County commissioner. She landed in first place in the Nov. 4 election that featured a crowded field of 13 candidates, which forced a runoff because no one got more than 50 percent of the votes. Higgins picked up 36 percent of the votes, while Gonzalez nabbed 19.5 percent for second place.\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis and congressman Byron Donalds, another MAGA Republican who is running for governor next year, also endorsed Gonzalez. Whether the president\u2019s seal of approval helps Gonzalez pick up financial support from\nSouth Florida\u2019s real estate industry\nremains to be seen.\nIn a statement, Higgins\u2019 campaign said she still has momentum based on \u201cthe broad, diverse coalition of support she has built.\u201d\n\u201cEileen has been elected three times by Democrats, Republicans, and independents alike because she shows up, solves problems and delivers for everyone,\u201d the statement said.\nGonzalez did not immediately respond to a request for comment. His Mission Miami political action committee raised $651,215 for the Nov. 4 election, despite a lack of donations from prominent developers, land use attorneys and real estate investors. Gonzalez\u2019s PAC did receive a combined $20,000 from six entities tied to business partners Bill Fuller and Martin Pinilla. The duo are developers and landlords primarily focused in Little Havana who won a\n$63 million\nverdict against ex-Miami city commissioner Joe Carollo in 2023.\nGonzalez testified on behalf of\nFuller\nand Pinilla that Carollo pressured him and other city staffers to target businesses the developers owned for code violations. Carollo also ran for mayor, and came in fourth place, despite collecting nearly $1 million for his Miami First PAC.\nCarollo and Higgins were the two mayoral candidates who garnered the most donations from real estate interests, campaign finance reports show. In some cases, high-profile donors gave to both Carollo and Higgins.\nFor instance, land use law firm Bercow Radell Fernandez Larkin &amp; Tapanes donated $10,000 each to Carollo\u2019s Miami First PAC and Higgins\u2019 Ethical Leadership for Miami committee. On Monday, the law firm also co-hosted a runoff fundraiser for Higgins at Brightline Station in downtown Miami.\nThe invitation shows the other co-hosts included Jose Gonzalez, executive vice-president of\nFlorida East Coast Industries\n, Brightline\u2019s parent company; Nelson Stabile, principal of\nIntegra Investments\n; Jonathan Raiffe, CEO of\nAdler Properties\n; and Sara Adler, principal of Adler Properties.\nDonors were asked to contribute the maximum $1,000 allowed by state law to Higgins\u2019 individual campaign, or \u201cunlimited funds\u201d to Ethical Leadership for Miami. Under state law, no limit exists on how much money PACs can receive from a single donor.\nHiggins is also receiving support from the Florida Democratic Party, which is paying for mailers trashing Gonzalez\u2019s tenure as city manager from 2017 to 2020. Yet, her campaign denied she\u2019s making it a left versus right affair.\n\u201cThe only person trying to inject partisan politics into this race is her opponent, who continues to chase out-of-town endorsements instead of focusing on the issues Miami residents face every day,\u201d the campaign said in its statement. \u201cEileen\u2019s campaign is powered by the people who know this city best \u2014 Miamians who want affordability, safer neighborhoods and a City Hall they can trust.\u201d",

        "content": "Opponents of Austin\u2019s convention center overhaul suffered a major blow after the city clerk ruled their petition short of the 20,000 valid signatures needed to force a ballot vote.\nThe decision effectively removed the most serious procedural threat to the $1.6 billion redevelopment, which kicked off in April and has already advanced deep into demolition and preconstruction, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nAustin United PAC\nsubmitted more than 20,000 signatures last month in an effort to delay or derail the project. But an independent review commissioned by the city found the\npetition\nfell well below the threshold of valid signatures needed, City Clerk Erika Brady said.\nThe PAC\u2019s proposal would have blocked work for up to seven years unless voters approved the project and would have redirected tourism revenue toward cultural and outdoor initiatives rather than conventions.\nActivist Bill Bunch, a leader in the PAC and head of the\nSave Our Springs Alliance\n, said the group disputes the city\u2019s determination and is reviewing the validation process. He signaled the PAC hopes to resolve the issue \u201camicably\u201d but may sue if necessary. The PAC argues the true cost of the redevelopment is $5.6 billion over its financing period, $4 billion above the city\u2019s estimate.\nCity officials maintain that the $1.6 billion figure, funded entirely through hotel occupancy taxes and convention center revenue rather than property taxes, is accurate to the cost of the project.\nThey argue the expansion is critical to\nAustin\u2019s tourism economy\nand cultural ecosystem. The old center is already demolished, and construction of a larger, 620,000-square-foot facility is scheduled to wrap in 2029.\nThe new version will boost rentable space by 70 percent and is expected to generate $750 million in annual economic impact \u2014 roughly a 60 percent increase from the old center \u2014 with bookings underway.\nCity Manager T.C. Broadnax said the previous center was turning away nearly half of prospective events due to space constraints, costing millions in lost tax revenue and undermining programs supported by hotel taxes, including arts and live music funds.\nTourism leaders echoed the message. Visit Austin CEO Tom Noonan said delays would hurt the local hospitality workforce of roughly 148,000 residents and stall growth in hotel taxes that sustain the city\u2019s cultural sector.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The campus aligns with Serpa\u2019s focus on \u201cdifferentiated assets in growth markets,\u201d pointing to a hands-on repositioning strategy the joint venture plans to deploy, Serpa Managing Partner Michael Provost told the outlet.\nInterior common areas and outdoor amenities are first up for renovation, with Aquila\u2019s team \u2014 Barrett, Max McDonald and Cody Schneider \u2014 taking over leasing.\nThe venture is buying into one of Austin\u2019s healthiest pockets for office space. Located off South Capital of Texas Highway near the\nSouth MoPac corridor\n, Cielo Center sits in the Southwest submarket, where vacancy was just 13.2 percent in the third quarter, well below the metro\u2019s 17.1 percent rate, according to Aquila. That stability has made the area a standout amid a broader office market still recalibrating to hybrid work and elevated borrowing costs.\nWhile institutional investors spent the last decade piling into Austin office deals, many are now pruning portfolios or offloading stabilized assets to refocus on sectors with more predictable returns.\nBuyers of Starwood\u2019s other Austin properties included Los Angeles-based BH Partners, which bought\nThe Park on Barton Creek\nin April.

        "content": "Brinshore Development\nis shopping one of the largest affordable housing portfolios Chicago has seen in years, a move set to reshuffle ownership across some of the city\u2019s most prominent mixed-income communities.\nThe developer put 2,435 Chicago units on the market last week, according to a listing from Berkadia, the Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\n. The asking price wasn\u2019t disclosed.\nThe package spans 20 properties and includes 695 public housing units tied to the\nChicago Housing Authority\n. All but one of the sites are\nCHA\npartnerships, underscoring how deeply\nBrinshore\nhas been embedded in the agency\u2019s rebuilding efforts since the early 2000s.\nBrinshore is one of the CHA\u2019s most prolific collaborators, helping carry out the housing authority\u2019s Plan for Transformation \u2014 the sweeping, often\ndelayed\npromise to replace aging high-rises with modern mixed-income communities.\nThe firm, founded in 1994 by Richard Sciortino and David Brint, ranks as the nation\u2019s 16th-largest affordable housing developer, with roughly 12,000 units across 16 states. Its Chicago holdings include some of the most visible examples of the city\u2019s redevelopment ambitions.\nThe sale comes as Brinshore continues to build.\nIn July, the firm and longtime partner the Michaels Organization started construction on another phase of Legends South \u2014 the decades-long overhaul of the former Robert Taylor Homes site in\nBronzeville\n. That latest stage features 52 units, mixing affordable and market-rate housing along with commercial space. Earlier phases at Legends South, already completed, are included in the offering now on the market.\nBrinshore is also wrapping the final phase of its redevelopment at the CHA\u2019s Horner-Westhaven site on the Near West Side, with a ribbon cutting for Westhaven Park Station scheduled this week. That property is part of the sale as well, signaling that the portfolio includes some of the most mature chapters of the\nCHA\npartnership.\nThe listing marks a significant moment for Chicago\u2019s affordable housing landscape. Bulk trades of stabilized mixed-income properties are rare, and the buyer pool is typically thin, given regulatory layers and long-term affordability covenants. But the size and location of Brinshore\u2019s package could draw national interest.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Sapir Corp has placed its Nomo Soho hotel into Chapter 11, the latest development in the ongoing collapse and liquidation of Alex Sapir\u2019s Israeli-backed real estate company.\nAlex Sapir\u2019s firm filed a petition Tuesday in bankruptcy court in Manhattan, seeking to run a court-supervised auction for the 26-story boutique hotel at 9 Crosby Street. The move is designed to cement a sale and pay down Sapir Corp\u2019s $155 million in bond debt across two Israeli bond series.\nThe filing comes three weeks after Sapir Corp\nentered insolvency proceedings\nin Israel, where the company told the Tel Aviv-Jaffa District Court that it could no longer meet bond payments or cover operating costs. All of its directors resigned and a trustee is now overseeing the company as it winds down.\n\u201cFacing the ongoing challenges in the market and slow recovery from two years of Covid, during which the operation was supported with significant equity, we chose to support a process that is the most likely to result in the full payment of the debt to the bond holders,\u201d a Sapir spokesperson said.\nAmidst the turmoil, Sapir has lined up a buyer for the 264-key hotel. Dan Hotels, one of Israel\u2019s largest hospitality chains, is in contract to acquire the property for $125 million. Bondholders approved the stalking-horse contract and now Sapir Corp will hold an auction, setting an initial overbid of $129.25 million, according to the bankruptcy filing. If no higher bidder materializes, Dan Hotels\u2019 $125 million offer will prevail.\nThe sale represents a long-awaited exit from a property that has faced a years-long debt struggle. Sapir and partner Gerard Guez bought Nomo Soho in 2015 for $208 million after a foreclosure sale by Deutsche Bank. Sapir later bought out most of Guez\u2019s stake and refinanced the property multiple times, including an $89 million Israeli bond-market loan in 2022 that replaced a Goldman Sachs mortgage.\nBut by 2024, the company was seeking maturity extensions and higher-cost fixes as debts came due. In July, Sapir failed to make a $3 million payment, triggering default.\nThe stylish, vine-covered hotel was hit hard during the pandemic, with occupancy plunging to 1.9 percent in April 2020. Sapir Corp put the property on the market last year, cut management fees and explored strategic options. The hotel currently employs 133 workers and is operating at a loss of about $1.3 million for the current year, per the bankruptcy filing, which was first reported by\nPincusCo\n.\nNomo Soho is one of only two assets left in Sapir Corp\u2019s portfolio. The other \u2014 an undeveloped site near Miami\u2019s Wynwood district \u2014 is listed for $41 million and in active sale talks, according to a filing with the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.\n",

The judge, for one, pointed NYCHA to housing court, which could create more delays.\nA vast majority of the residents at the public housing complexes are able to stay in place while work is done to build the forthcoming properties. But some are being asked to temporarily relocate and not all are willing, leading to multiple lawsuits filed by NYCHA.\nResidents at the complex have the right to an apartment at the rebuilt complex. Those relocating are also entitled to a \u201ccomparable\u201d unit nearby on a temporary basis with moving and packing expenses provided.\nResidents were told to move out by Oct. 26 as demolition is expected to start in the fall or winter. NYCHA and Related Companies\nfiled plans\nfor a 12-story, 217-unit building at 401 West 19th Street over the summer.\nThe development team, which also includes Essence Development, is tasked with replacing more than 2,000 public housing units. They will also build retail and commercial space, as well as 3,500 mixed-income apartments, 1,000 of which will be put aside at affordable rates.\nAs of 2023, the project was expected to cost $1.5 billion.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

It\u2019s on the market for nearly $22 million.\nWeiner is also\nin contract to buy\nthe 11,500-square-foot mansion on 2.6 acres at 16071 Quiet Vista Circle, asking $20.9 million.\nStone Creek Ranch is an ultra wealthy private neighborhood in unincorporated Palm Beach County, where actor, musician and entrepreneur Mark Wahlberg recently paid\n$32.6 million\nto acquire a mansion.\nWeiner said he\u2019s buying the two properties furnished. He hasn\u2019t decided yet what he plans to do with both mansions.\nThe house on Hawk Shadow Lane is on the market with Douglas Elliman\u2019s Senada Ad\u017eem. Ad\u017eem declined to comment. The property includes a nine-car air conditioned garage that can fit 18 cars using lifts; a club room with a 150-inch projection screen; a pool and 660 feet of lake frontage, according to the listing. It has six bedrooms and 10 bathrooms.\nA company managed by life coach and author Mari Vasan paid $7 million for the home in 2018, a year after it was completed, property records show. Vasan is a former Wall Street research analyst and Deutsche Bank managing director.\nWeiner compared the gated community to Beverly Park in Los Angeles, where he said most homes are on 2.5 acres each and have tennis courts, and the neighborhood has armed guards. But Weiner has fully set his sights on Florida, which he said is \u201cthe new Golden State.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no better place to invest money in real estate than South Florida,\u201d he said. \u201cCalifornia turned to rust, and New York turned to mold.\u201d\nWeiner made his fortune with the $3.9 billion sale of Rockstar Energy to PepsiCo in 2020, the same year he\nbegan investing\nin South Florida luxury real estate. He also\nowns mansions in Miami Beach\n. Forbes pegs his net worth at $5.4 billion.\nWeiner said Stone Creek Ranch, which is across the street from the Mizner Country Club, has \u201cfar more upside to go.\u201d He said his purchases are a \u201csteal\u201d and that prospective buyers have approached him to flip the homes for millions more.\n\u201cThe teardowns in Palm Beach are $200 million, and this has more land,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s gated and armed and no one can drive by. What is that worth? You can be in Miami in an hour, Palm Beach in 30 minutes.\u201d\n",

Many joint venture agreements gave partners sweeping control over operations \u2014 including the ability to remove StoryBuilt as manager \u2014 which chilled outside interest. Those arrangements, the receiver noted, were \u201cunfavorable\u201d and left the firm with minority positions buyers don\u2019t want to inherit.\nAs of Aug. 31,\nStoryBuilt\nheld stakes in just two active developments, down from 13 when the portfolio first hit the market in late 2023. One is North Bluff in South Austin, where construction restarted and all condos had sold by the end of August. The other is Jolene, a West Dallas mixed-use project once envisioned to hold 800 homes and retail; that site still carries more than $46 million in secured debt. No update was provided on its progress.\nThe\nreceivership\nhas generated about $18.7 million in revenue from sales, paying off nearly $14 million in secured debt tied to completed projects. Altogether, roughly $21.1 million has been returned to creditors since late 2023, though the total amount owed is murky.\nWith 14 joint ventures still tied up in long development timelines, Stapleton is now in the second phase of a receivership that could stretch for years. The final outcome hinges on whether those stakes can be sold, bought out or simply held until the projects eventually deliver.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The seven-story residence traded hands less than two months after it\nhit the market\nand for only $1 million below the\n$29 million asking price\n.\nThe identity of the buyer was not disclosed. The deal, which works out to $2,154 per square foot, was first reported by\nRealtor.com\n.\nCosby put the property on the market in September, about nine months after lender First Foundation Bank accused Cosby of defaulting on a $17.5 million loan tied to the 13,000-square-foot home. The bank alleged he stopped making payments on the debt and owes more than $300,000 in property taxes.\nThe sale staves off the foreclosure proceedings initiated against Cosby.\nCosby and his wife, Camille, bought the limestone mansion in 1990 for $6.3 million. Known as the Luyster Mansion, the residence was built in 1899 and is full of period flourishes, such as mahogany floors and an original elevator that connects nearly every level.\nThe six-bedroom property features a dining room that seats 30, multiple suites, a roof garden and a parlor level for entertaining.\nCorcoran\u2019s Adam Schneider had the\nlisting\n, which marked the first time the property hit the market in more than 35 years.\nIn April, Cosby listed another townhouse, a four-story property at 243 East 61st Street, once used by his late son Ennis, for $7 million. That asking price was reduced to $6.75 million in July.\nCitiMortgage accused Cosby and his wife of defaulting on a $4.2 million loan tied to that home and is\npursuing foreclosure\nthere, too.\nCosby\u2019s sexual assault conviction was overturned in 2021, but he continues to face claims, including one in January accusing the actor of drugging and sexually assaulting a 15-year-old in Las Vegas in the 1980s.\nBill and Camille stay out of the spotlight and primarily live outside Philadelphia, where they paid $225,000 for a suburban estate in the 1980s before \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d exploded the comedian\u2019s profile.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Developers John and Raelynn Hickey took steps to move forward with their controversial\nOuter Sunset\nbehemoth despite losing the development site to foreclosure recently.\nThe couple submitted a new application to build a 50-story apartment tower in the heart of the neighborhood, the San Francisco Standard\nreported\n. The plans call for 100 percent affordable apartments with 682 units.\nTheir ambition doesn\u2019t line up with reality, however. Last month, the Hickeys\u2019 lender, Loan Oak Fund, seized control of the lots at 2700 and 2750 Sloat Boulevard through a judicial foreclosure. The Hickeys no longer have any connection to the site, a spokesperson for the lender said.\nThe Hickeys bought the property in 2020 for $8.5 million and framed their plan as a density-boosting, state-law-enabled workaround to Outer Sunset\u2019s height limits. City planners rejected previous applications, including a smaller two-building concept.\nBehind the scenes, the couple was trying to fend off lenders, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy this year in an attempt to stall foreclosure. A U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge tossed the case two weeks before the auction, siding with Lone Oak\u2019s claim that the bankruptcy was a delay tactic rather than an effort to restructure. When the lots came up for public auction last month, the Hickeys had\nracked up more than $12 million in unpaid debt\n; Lone Oak seized control by submitting a credit bid of $11.1 million.\nJohn Hickey has a criminal history in California real estate.\nThe developer proposed building one of the biggest residential towers in the state in San Francisco\u2019s India Basin in 2004. The plans collapsed when he was prosecuted and sentenced to\neight years in prison\nin connection with a Ponzi scheme regarding land development in Napa and Sonoma Counties.\nHickey and an associate were found to have scammed more than 700 investors out of $20 million by falsifying property records, using the money to pay off early investors and personal purchases rather than to acquire real estate for redevelopment. The accusations were reminiscent of that of\nembattled Sonoma developer Ken Mattson\n, who is\nfacing prison time for similar allegations\n.\nHickey had paid just $5,150 of the more than $17 million he owed in restitution by 2016, three years after his release from prison.\nRaelynn Hickey intended to sell 2700 Sloat Boulevard this year to a joint venture of developers that reportedly were prepared to move forward if the redevelopment was entitled, she\ntold\nthe San Francisco Business Times earlier this year.\nA Planning Department spokesperson said the Hickeys\u2019 newest proposal is active but not complete or code-compliant. Architecture firm SCB, which submitted the application on behalf of the couple, said it is \u201cnot currently actively working on progressing the design documents.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The landlord has already extended its CMBS debt five times since 2020, according to Fitch, leaving no extensions left.\nBrookfield has seen an exodus of tenants in recent years, including law firms Goodwin Proctor, Osler Hoskin &amp; Harcourt and asset manager ClearBridge Investments (both those vacancies, however, were filled).\nIn September, law firm Covington &amp; Burling announced a plan to leave 200,000 square feet behind as it moves to Hudson Yards, leaving a large hole for Brookfield to fill, though the building is fully occupied at the moment.\nCash flow at the building hit $42.3 million last year, approximately 14 percent below the levels underwritten five years earlier.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The sales gallery officially opened this spring and buyers started signing contracts in the summer, following an initial \u201cwhisper\u201d marketing campaign targeting friends and family, according to Defortuna.\nDefortuna\u2019s Brickell-based Fortune International Group and Karmely\u2019s New York-based KAR Properties are partnering with Faena on\nFaena Residences\n. The Miami River project will consist of a pair of 68-story towers with 440 condos, combined, connected by a roughly 50,000-square-foot bridge with amenities, Defortuna and Karmely said.\nCondos will range from one-bedroom to four-bedroom units, plus penthouses. Asking prices are $1.4 million to $4 million, with penthouses asking as much as $35 million.\nNearly 100 units have been presold so far for a combined $300 million, Defortuna said. The demand is nearly 60 percent foreign and 40 percent domestic, he added.\nThe Saturday celebration was held on the 1.8-acre riverfront vacant site at 24 Southwest Fourth Street, where the towers will rise. About 250 people attended the party, according to Defortuna.\nFaena Residences is the second Faena-branded project in Miami-Dade County, after the\nFaena District in Miami Beach\nthat includes condos, a hotel, bazaar, and an event and show venue. Faena also has projects in New York and Buenos Aires, with plans to expand to Tulum and the Middle East.\nThe goal is to bring the brand\u2019s style and cultural offerings to the Miami River, Faena told\nThe Real Deal\non Saturday after his speech on stage, describing the brand.\n\u201cFaena is Faena. Faena is a place like no other,\u201d he said. It\u2019s \u201ca place of fantasy, a place of entertainment, a place for fun.\u201d\nFaena Residences will be the first part of KAR and Fortune\u2019s three-phase project spanning over 5 acres in the Miami River District. Faena will be a partner in the future phases. The three lots are adjacent to the Wind, Ivy and Mint condo towers that were completed from 2008 to 2010.\nThe developers stayed mum about plans for the additional phases. Karmely cited interconnectivity among the phases, creating a shared space partly through the landscaping and a hub for education. Faena Residences\u2019 sky bridge will be home to a movie theater, event space underneath a cathedral-like dome, library, demonstration kitchen, recording studio and other features that create a \u201ccommunity,\u201d he said.\nFaena Residences is one of the last projects by the late architect Rafael Vi\u00f1oly, Karmely said. Vi\u00f1oly died in 2023.\nConstruction is expected to start mid or late next year, Defortuna said. The towers are expected to be completed in 2029.\nMarried couple Raphaella and Christian Sigel, jewelers and real estate developers from Brazil, are among those who already reserved a unit. They said they are buying a two-bedroom vacation home for about $2 million.\n\u201cWe discovered Faena when we went to Buenos Aires, and we stayed in the Faena hotel,\u201d Christian Sigel said, adding that they looked at other branded condos in South Florida and settled on Faena.\nDr. Ash Beharrie, a kidney specialist who lives in Sunrise, is buying a 24th-floor condo for his family that they may use as a primary home in the future.\n\u201cThis is something I want to keep forever,\u201d said Beharri, who also looked at other branded projects in Miami. \u201cFaena is an amazing name.\u2026 It spares no expense.\u201d\nIn fact, waiting a few years until it\u2019s completed is not an issue, Beharrie added. \u201cThat\u2019s actually good. It gives me some time to pay for it,\u201d he joked, declining to disclose the unit\u2019s price.\nSanjeev Raman, a technology executive who lives at Elser Hotel &amp; Residences in downtown Miami, is buying an 18th-floor, two-bedroom condo with his wife, as an investment. They may use it as a primary home in the future. \u201cWe may end up living in Faena just because we like the brand and the lifestyle it\u2019s offering and the Rose membership,\u201d he said, referring to the Faena Rose exclusive membership club.\nGenerally, Miami\u2019s new condo buyer profile has shifted in recent years from primarily foreigners to more domestic buyers, as the city became a magnet for New Yorkers and other out-of-staters during the pandemic.\nNow, more New Yorkers are expected to head south due to\nZohran Mamdani\u2019s\nmayoral election win, Defortuna and Karmely said. Mamdani\u2019s calls for higher income and corporate taxes, his promise to freeze rents on rent-stabilized apartments and views on Israel have stirred anxiety among some New Yorkers.\n\u201cI think inevitably we will get\u201d New York buyers, Karmely said, adding that some of his friends have recently called him to inquire about speaking with Faena Residences sales representatives. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want people to come here because they are escaping something. I want them to come here because this has become the city of the Western Hemisphere.\u201d\nMamdani\u2019s election also is prompting foreign buyers to question whether they should rush to make a presale to avoid a repeat of the pandemic, when condo prices skyrocketed amid high demand, Defortuna said.\n\u201cI think that the feeling is they [foreigners] better act now. The urgency is back into the market,\u201d he said, adding that he just came back from a trip to Argentina and Brazil. \u201cForeign buyers are used to buying preconstruction, paying in installments \u2026. It\u2019s a very natural process for them. But they feel if the New Yorkers come, prices are going to be increasing.\u201d\nFaena Residences is expected to be particularly popular among buyers from Argentina, the home country for both Defortuna and Faena, as well as Brazil and Mexico, among other countries, Defortuna said.\nThe Miami River project will add another branded condo to an already saturated market, as South Florida is the\nepicenter\nof branded condo development in North America, according to Knight Frank. Miami has 48 completed projects and 55 planned, trailing only Dubai, according to Savills.\nAmong planned projects are a\nRitz-Carlton in North Bay Village,\na\nWaldorf Astoria under construction in downtown Miami\nand a\nNobu in Brickell\n.\nBut the developers aren\u2019t fazed by competition. \u201cAny time is the right time,\u201d to launch Faena Residences, Karmely said.\n\u201cThere are a lot of people selling burgers: McDonald\u2019s, Burger King, Wendy\u2019s. They can keep selling. What we have here is such a completely different approach,\u201d Karmely said. \u201cThere is no other competition because frankly, you cannot pick another project that brings the combination of talent, location, execution, capability and design we have here.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The future of SL Green and RXR\u2019s Worldwide Plaza was uncertain. But a big name in New York City real estate appears to hold the key: Gary Barnett.\nThe Extell Development leader purchased the mezzanine debt backing the Midtown office building, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. It\u2019s unclear when Extell came into control of the debt \u2014 the company declined to comment to the publication \u2014 but it puts Barnett in prime position to take control of the building at its\nUCC foreclosure auction\n, scheduled for Jan. 15.\nThe previously undisclosed mezzanine lender scheduled a foreclosure auction for the controlling entity of 825 Eighth Avenue. The entity that controls the building received a default notice last September from the owner of $190 million in mezzanine debt, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing from New York REIT Liquidating (the LLC in charge of New York REIT\u2019s\nliquidation\n), which is also an owner of the property. Ownership is in default of both senior and mezzanine debt as of July, according to the filing.\nGoldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank originated $260 million in mezzanine debt. The property is backed\nby $940 million in CMBS debt\noriginated by the two institutions, plus the mezzanine financing. Proceeds from the auction will go towards paying off the mezzanine debt and funding unpaid interest payments.\nThe debt\nwent to special servicing\nin September 2024 after law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore vacated 617,000 square feet for Brookfield\u2019s Two Manhattan West, leaving Worldwide Plaza about 40 percent vacant. That space remains empty and the building was only 63 percent occupied as of March, according to Morningstar, down from 91 percent in 2023.\nThat could worsen as Nomura Holdings \u2014 the largest tenant remaining \u2014 plans to slash 75,000 square feet from its footprint by the beginning of 2027. The leftover 630,000 square feet is due to expire in 2033.\nThe property was appraised at $345 million in April, down\n80 percent\nfrom its $1.7 billion valuation in 2017, according to CMBS loan documents. That appraisal drop is expected to cause $500 million of losses to the property\u2019s CMBS bondholders.\nSL Green and RXR acquired a roughly 49 percent stake in 2015; the since-liquidated New York REIT holds the majority.\nLast month, DBRS Morningstar downgraded the rating to junk on the CMBS trust holding $705M of the building\u2019s debt. The special servicer is reportedly negotiating with the borrower regarding a loan modification, according to Morningstar.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A clash between the founders of the New York City-based brokerage\nCasa Blanca\nand its investors has landed in court.\nCEO Hannah Bomze sued two of its investors, Samuel Ben-Avraham and Christian Visdomini, in October over allegations that they\u2019re withholding $1.2 million in commissions owed to her, according to a motion for summary judgment filed in New York Supreme Court.\nNow those same investors are firing back with their own lawsuit accusing Bomze and her husband, chief operating officer Erez Zarur, of misappropriating the firm\u2019s funds to pay for personal expenses, such as luxury vacations.\nIn their complaint, Ben-Avraham and Visdomini accuse Bomze and Zarur of \u201cdishonest and disloyal acts,\u201d including refusing them access to the company\u2019s financials, investing more than $900,000 of the firm\u2019s money into cryptocurrency and generating \u201cphony documents to support [Bomze\u2019s] fabricated claims for commission.\u201d\nBomze denied the allegations, describing the lawsuit in a statement as retaliatory and \u201cfilled with slander and distractions.\u201d She added that she expects the judge to dismiss the case as it lacks merit.\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent five years building Casa Blanca into one of the fastest-growing and most respected brokerages in New York,\u201d said Bomze in the statement. \u201cI will continue to protect the company I built and the work that made it successful.\u201d\nJim Kennedy, an attorney for Ben-Avraham and Visdomini, billed the investors\u2019 case as \u201cstraightforward,\u201d adding, \u201cwe have faith in the court\u2019s ability to resolve it.\u201d\nCourt documents reveal that what began as a legal action to collect unpaid commissions has since morphed into a messy falling out between Casa Blanca\u2019s leadership and financial backers.\n\u201cCasa Blanca is not only at a crossroads, but also at a stalemate,\u201d the investors state in their complaint. \u201cThrough their deliberate and knowing misconduct, Hannah and Erez are preventing Sam and Chris from protecting their interests \u2014 and those of our investors \u2014 in the Company.\u201d\nInside the dispute\nBomze and Zarur launched Casa Blanca in 2019, backed by a $1.8 million investment from Ben-Avraham, also an early investor in WeWork and Ronnie Fieg\u2019s streetwear brand, Kith. The firm, which marketed itself as the \u201cTinder of real estate\u201d with its app-focused approach, now has\nroughly 200 agents\n.\nIn the lawsuit, Ben-Avraham and Visdomini allege Bomze and Zarur didn\u2019t contribute any capital to start the brokerage, and that they together own 43 percent of the company, while Ben-Avraham owns 41 percent. (Visdomini owns just under 3 percent, while the rest is controlled by other investors.)\nBomze claims in her motion that between 2021 and 2025, she earned roughly $2.5 million in commissions\nfrom transactions\nwhere she personally represented the buyer or seller, though so far, she\u2019d only received about $1.3 million. She alleges that under the terms of an independent broker agreement, she\u2019s allowed to keep all of the fees associated with those deals.\nHowever, Ben-Avraham and Visdomini pushed back on those claims, arguing that Bomze\u2019s compensation agreement, which consists of a salary and 0.5 percent of the company\u2019s commissions, doesn\u2019t include a provision about personal deals.\nThe investors further allege that Bomze created fake documents to support her claims, and that even if the broker agreement existed before her request for commission payment, it was never shown to the board. The investors claim Bomze should have to pay back the commissions she\u2019s already received.\n\u201cThe Company could not operate if one officer received 100 percent of commissions on her own deals, and no investor would have agreed to fund the venture on that basis,\u201d the complaint states. The board \u201chas never discussed or approved any addendum or side agreement providing a personal commission entitlement to any Manager.\u201d\nBut Bomze dismissed the investors\u2019 claims, instead arguing that since she \u201cpersonally procured and closed those transactions,\u201d she\u2019s entitled to the commissions.\n\u201cUnder New York law, these commissions belong to me,\u201d Bomze said in the statement. \u201cI intentionally postponed collecting them and left the money in the company for years to support the business, strengthen cash flow, and fuel its growth.\u201d\nIn addition to the commission dispute, Ben-Avraham and Visdomini also accused Bomze and Zarur of \u201cpaying hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal expenses with the Company\u2019s credit cards.\u201d\nAmong the expenses were \u201chigh-end restaurant charges, luxury vacations, charges related to the Bomzes\u2019 children\u2019s summer camp, gifts given to individuals unrelated to the Company or its business, and memberships to private tennis clubs, restaurants, and nightclubs in New York City.\u201d The complaint also stated that Zarur used $900,000 of the firm\u2019s funds to buy Bitcoin.\nLouis Buckworth, who\npreviously worked with Casa Blanca\n, allegedly reported his concerns about the alleged misappropriation of funds to Ben-Avraham in July, after he and his wife met Bomze and Zarur for drinks at Le Bilboquet in the Hamptons following the couple\u2019s dinner at the restaurant.\nBuckworth told Ben-Avraham that Bomze and Zarur paid for their entire one-on-one dinner with the corporate credit card even though it was a \u201cpurely social (and very expensive) dinner,\u201d according to the complaint.\nBen-Avraham and Visdomini filed their lawsuit after negotiations with Bomze to withdraw her earlier action broke down, according to the complaint, which seeks damages related to what they describe as \u201cegregious acts of betrayal.\u201d\nThey\u2019re also requesting the judge order Bomze and Zarur to provide them access to all of the company\u2019s financials, including \u201cbanking statements, related software platforms, passwords and logins necessary to access the Company\u2019s financial information.\u201d\nThey\u2019re also seeking declaratory judgment stating that Bomze is not owed any of the $1.2 million in alleged outstanding commissions and that she has no right to keep the $1.3 million she\u2019s already been paid.\n",

The namesake coffee chain of Ralph Lauren is seeking to relocate from 160 Fifth Avenue.\nRestaurants are barred from taking the retail space on the building\u2019s ground floor, a commercial condominium owned by Ascot Properties NYC.\nResidents had a bad experience with a Russian restaurant years ago, when Nasha Rasha\u2019s presence led to \u201cdisastrous results\u201d according to an affidavit from the co-op board president, who complained of odors, noise, trash and vermin, all of which were \u201ctotally unbearable\u201d to the residents above.\nBut Ascot\u2019s lawyer claimed in court documents that Ralph\u2019s is not a restaurant, but an eating and drinking establishment, which the attorney claims sidesteps the issue.\nA lawyer for the residents disagrees.\n\u201cA restaurant is defined in Merriam Webster as a business establishment where meals or refreshments may be purchased,\u201d read the complaint from the residents.\nResidents are wary of what they see two blocks north at the Ralph\u2019s location in operation. The complaint references \u201cmobs of people on the sidewalk, loud noise and garbage.\u201d But the lawyer for Ascot objected to the complainants\u2019 concerns and instead suggested that if there are problems with the business after it opens, they \u201ccan seek injunctive relief then.\u201d\nShould Ralph\u2019s sign on the dotted line, the shop plans to renovate the 739-square-foot retail space, moving around walls and adding finishes, fixtures and a ramp. Buildout would take eight to nine months and Ascot would benefit to the tune of $20,000 a month in rent; it acquired the unit in 2016 for $6.4 million.\nThere are 19 residences at 140 Fifth Avenue, which doesn\u2019t see a frequent amount of turnover. The most recent sale took place more than a year ago when a two-bedroom unit traded for $2.4 million.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The Riviera Beach City Council unanimously voted to forge a deal with a team led by Sonnenblick Development that will include the construction of a new city hall and library, sports complexes, and residential units on about 72 acres of publicly owned land.\nThe 5 to 0 vote took place during Riviera Beach City Council\u2019s Monday meeting. Should negotiations fail with Pacific Palisades, California-based Sonnenblick, the city would then arrange a deal with its competitor, Peter Bayatarian\u2019s North Palm Beach-based Forest Development.\nSonnenblick Development\u2019s partners include Clearwater-based Sports Facilities Companies, Washington, D.C.-based Gragg Cardona Souadi, and West Palm Beach-based RDG Development Group.\nBoth Sonnenblick Development, led by Robert Sonnenblick, and Forest Development answered an invitation-to-negotiate that centers on redeveloping 40.8 acres of city-owned land at 600 and 601 West Blue Heron Boulevard where Riviera Beach\u2019s current city hall now stands; 29 acres of vacant Palm Beach County School District-owned land near Inlet Grove Community High School; and 2 acres of city-owned land at 2215 Broadway, according to a summary presented by the city\u2019s consultant, PFM Group Consulting.\nSonnenblick\u2019s $480.6 proposal, which will be designed by Omaha-based architecture firm Leo A. Daly, received a slightly higher score from the city\u2019s selection committee than Forest Development\u2019s phased $635 million redevelopment plan.\nSonnenblick\u2019s concept includes a $100 million city hall, a $59.5 million sports complex with indoor and outdoor facilities, and a pair of $237 million mixed-use residential developments that would target teachers and first responders as residents.\nSonnenblick\u2019s proposal has two options for a new city hall. The firm could build a new 150,000-square-foot city hall with a 600-space parking garage somewhere within the ITN area, or it can build a 150,000-square-foot city hall and library complex with 1,000 spaces on what is now the water tank at C Street within Marina Village, a waterfront area at 200 East 13th Street that the city of Riviera Beach\nis also intent on redeveloping\n.\nSonnenblick\u2019s athletic facility proposal, spearheaded by Sports Facilities Companies, includes an indoor sports facility with four basketball and eight volleyball courts, 10,000 square feet of meeting space and a 16,000-square-foot fitness center, as well as an outdoor complex with four fields, eight tennis/pickleball courts, four outdoor basketball courts and other features.\nFor housing, Sonnenblick proposed building The Flats at Blue Heron, a 488-unit project by West Blue Heron Boulevard that will include a rail transit station and a broadband telecommunications network, and the 170-unit The Commons at Broadway and West 23rd Street.\nRiviera Beach issued an invitation to negotiate in 2024 as a means of replacing the city\u2019s crumbling 1970s-era city hall and attracting more investment in the city.\nSince then, a slew of projects have been proposed in Riviera Beach with\nabout 2,000 apartments and condos in the pipeline.\nAmong the new projects are Forest Development\u2019s\nOculina\n, a pair of 25-story condo towers at 3700 Broadway that will be built next door to the nearly completed\nNautilus 220\nproject that Forest and Daniel Kodski\u2019s Royal Palm Companies are developing in neighboring Lake Park.\nLast week, Forest Development also beat four other contenders for the right to negotiate the purchase of a 2.2-acre parcel from Riviera Beach\u2019s Community Redevelopment Agency for a future\n$325 million project near the waterfront\nat 1851 Broadway.\nSonnenblick emphasized his track record of building public facilities all over the country.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t build $400 million condo projects. What we do is build government tenanted buildings like city halls, federal government offices, state and county buildings, things like that,\u201d Sonnenblick told council members.\nSports Facilities Companies, meanwhile, has built and programmed sports and recreational facilities all over the country. While Gragg Cardona Souadi has built affordable housing and mixed-income projects in the Washington, D.C. metro area.\nSonnenblick has also made a bid to construct a\nMargaritaville Hotel in Riviera Beach\u2019s Marina Village",

        "content": "Pantzer Properties bought a 393-unit apartment building in Miramar for $161 million.\nThe purchase comes on the heels of New York-based Pantzer closing its $1 billion Panco Strategic Real Estate Fund VI that will target multifamily properties on the East Coast.\nBoston-based Rockpoint and Coconut Grove-based Related Group sold the eight-story building at 1-3 Main Street to Pantzer, according to records. The buyer borrowed a $102.4 million Fannie Mae loan for the purchase.\nThe purchase price breaks down to $409,700 per apartment.\nRelated, led by the P\u00e9rez family, and Rockpoint, led by Bill Walton and Keith Gelb, completed development of the building last year. They had paid $3.2 million for the 3.8-acre development site in 2021, records show.\nThe building, which Pantzer renamed The Point at Miramar, offers studios and one-bedroom to three-bedroom units. Monthly rents range from $1,489 to $4,835, according to Apartments.com.\nPantzer, led by Jason and Jordan Pantzer, closed its $1 billion Panco Strategic Real Estate Fund VI last month, according to a company news release According to an affidavit Jordan Pantzer signed and filed in Broward County, Panco Fund VI Holdings is the sole member of the purchasing entity that bought the Miramar apartments.\nPantzer has been a frequent investor in South Florida apartments. Last year, it paid\n$83.5 million\nfor the 245-unit The Point at Palm Beach Grove complex at 7130 Okeechobee Boulevard in West Palm Beach. Also last year, Pantzer bought the 352-unit The Point at Lakeside complex at 11481 Northwest 41st Street in Doral for\n$139.2 million.\nSouth Florida multifamily investment sales have experienced an uptick in recent months, despite higher interest rates, slower in-migration by out-of-staters and other headwinds. Many of the buyers are relying on Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae loans, as Pantzer did for its Miramar purchase, or are turning to insurance companies for loans.\nThis month, West Shore paid\n$117.9 million\nfor the 542-unit Palm Beach Gardens Apartments complex at 4120 Union Square Boulevard in Palm Beach Gardens. Last month, Tishman Speyer bought the 270-unit Bell at Broken Sound Apartments at 5500 Broken Sound Boulevard Northwest and 950 Northwest Broken Sound Parkway in Boca Raton for\n$124.5 million\n.\n",

CBRE\u2019s Anthony DeLorenzo, Greg Sullivan, Sammy Cemo and Bryan Johnson represented the seller.\nThe plan calls for detached two-story single-family homes and four-story stacked flats. Two-bedroom, two-bathroom units will span 1,000 square feet, while four-bedroom, three-bathroom homes will span 2,400 square feet.\nThe development is expected to take about two years.\nTrinity built its former Bear Street headquarters in 1976. The site has been in flux since the broadcaster vacated it in 2017, leaving behind\nfilm studios\n, a theater and parking facilities that sparked multiple reinvention and redevelopment attempts.\nEducation First Properties floated an international language school before the pandemic scuttled the plan.\nAfter Khoshbin Company bought the property in 2021, the firm reimagined the grounds as \u201cThe Palazzo by Khoshbin,\u201d leaning into the property\u2019s European-inspired design in opening an event venue.\nMeritage Homes has been active in the area.

        "content": "As Chicago\u2019s suburbs reel in multifamily investors, outer-ring communities that were once overlooked are gaining momentum.\nMultifamily sales in the suburbs were up 40 percent year-over-year in the third quarter, Chicago-based brokerage\nInterra Realty\nfound, and a few counties stood out in the competitive field.\nOut of the metro area\u2019s total multifamily sales, the share of sales that took place in Kendall County was up 300 percent, and a whopping 550 percent in Will County, compared to the same time period last year, according to new analysis from Interra.\n\u201cAs renters migrate to these areas in search of space and affordability, investors are following suit to capture that steady demand,\u201d said Patrick Kennelly, Interra\u2019s managing partner for suburban multifamily.\nUntil recently the multifamily market in these western and southwest suburbs had been outshined by areas closer to downtown Chicago like DuPage and Lake counties.\nChicago\u2019s steady job market and measured supply has made it a strong base for multifamily investors. The\nMidwest\nas a whole has surged to the top of rent growth charts, bringing in a wave of institutional buyers this year betting that limited development pipelines in the region will let landlords keep pushing rents. Meanwhile, markets like Denver and others are slowing price hikes as a glut of new supply comes online.\nIn the Chicago area, Interra recorded 155 apartment building sales between $1 million and $50 million during the first three quarters of 2025 compared to 115 in all of 2024. Cook County still dominated, despite its chaotic property tax conditions, with 94 deals made so far this year.\nBut interest is spreading to farther flung communities.\nIn the first three quarters, there were 24 transactions in DuPage County, 11 each in Lake and Will counties, seven in Kane County and four each in Kendall and McHenry counties.\nThe boost in Will and Kendall counties is particularly notable as rents continue to jump in the urban core and its surrounding suburbs.\nWill County\u2019s largest transaction last quarter was the sale of the\nLincoln Station Apartments\n. After a decade-long construction quest and an ensuing legal dispute, rescue capital lender 7 Acre Investments gave developer Richard Gammonley the green light to sell his newly built complex in New Lenox. Miami-based\nJSB Capital\nbought the 220-unit property from Gammonley and 7 Acre for $65 million.\nThere\u2019s also been a growing crop of major developments stretching west into Kendall County, where two multifamily sales of more than $80 million took place this year.\nIn June, the Emblem Apartments in Oswego were sold by their developer, homebuilding giant Lennar\u2019s multifamily arm Quarterra, for $84 million to an affiliate of a J.P. Morgan real estate investment trust, public records show. That was followed with an Oct. 1 purchase by\nNew York-based DRA Advisors\nof the 368-unit Aurora at Summerfield Apartments within Kendall County for $88 million.\n",

The money would cover a shared-use path, new street lighting and upgraded crosswalks and signals at Algonquin and Linneman roads, according to village documents.\nAnother $2 million would go to the\nMount Prospect Park\nDistrict for recreational upgrades, anchored by a new splash pad at the RecPlex. The contribution gives the village a visible, near-term community benefit as it greenlights a project designed to churn out substantial tax revenues for decades.\nThe agreement follows trustees\u2019 approval last month of revisions to Cloud HQ\u2019s site plan. What was once a three-building campus approved in 2022 has been reworked into two larger structures. The shift streamlines construction and maintains the project\u2019s revenue potential, village staff say.\nOnce both buildings are running, officials estimate the campus will generate more than $7 million a year in electricity tax revenue alone \u2014 a lucrative line item for municipalities courting data center operators.\nThe\ndata center\nis also expected to be a major engine for\nMount Prospect\u2019s\ntax increment financing district, with staff projecting more than $100 million in future TIF revenue. That pool would give the village ample room to fund infrastructure upgrades and redevelopment efforts in its long-overlooked southern corridor.\nCloud HQ aims to deliver its first building in 2027, with the second slated for late 2030. Construction would reactivate a site that has sat largely dormant since United decamped, a point Mayor Paul Hoefert leaned on in voicing support for the deal at a board meeting last month. He called the project\u2019s long-term financial impact \u201chuge\u201d and said it could help the village avoid raising property taxes.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The development near Levi\u2019s Stadium will replace an office complex.\nThe plans call for 272 beds, an emergency department, intensive care unit, labor and delivery department and other services for patients. The hospital is projected to open in 2031, and some of the buildings on the campus will open in 2027.\nThe hospital is one part of Sutter Health\u2019s larger multi-site expansion in\nSanta Clara\n. The proposed medical center will be one component of Sutter West Santa Clara Campus, a five-building, 700,000-square-foot campus that will also offer care units for cancer, orthopedic and sports medicine, women\u2019s health, heart and vascular health.\nSutter Health already has a presence in Santa Clara. Last month, the health care system opened the nearby Sutter East Santa Clara Campus at 2441 Mission College Boulevard. That complex spans about 300,000 square feet and includes primary care, speciality care, ambulatory surgery and urgent care.\nSutter Health\u2019s East and West Santa Clara campuses\ncost an estimated $2.8 billion.\nSutter Health, which owns more than 20 hospitals in Northern California, has been expanding in the Bay Area this year.\nIt bought a 12-acre life sciences campus in Emeryville for $450 million in February. The health care firm\nbought the two-building, 530,000-square-foot campus\nand a handful of vacant lots at 53rd and Horton Streets. It plans to redevelop them into a 1.3 million-square-foot hospital and medical center as part of its $1 billion Sutter Emeryville Campus expansion in the East Bay.\nThe purchase from Blackstone\u2019s BioMed Realty worked out to $615 per square foot. The firm has made seven real estate purchases to assemble the forthcoming Sutter Emeryville Campus.

The project, 635 Exchange, is rising on a 36-acre plot that used to be a City of Dallas landfill. It\u2019s expected to be delivered next fall.\nDallas-based developer Creation and PGIM, the asset management arm of Prudential Financial, landed a $65.5 million construction loan for the project in recent months, D Magazine\nreported\n. JLL Capital Markets arranged the financing.\nThe three-building hub will be at the nexus of Interstates 35 and 635 in northwest Dallas. The old landfill was at 11535 Newberry Street. The location offers easy access to DFW International Airport.\nAt the groundbreaking celebration, Creation made a $25,000 donation to vocational school CLC Inc.\u2019s YouthBuild project, which provides education and job training to at-risk youth.\nPGIM\u2019s Soultana Reigle expects the timing of the project to allow it to \u201cbenefit from structural tailwinds in supply-chain optimization and e-commerce demand.\u201d\nThough its vacancy rate ticked up in the third quarter, Dallas-Fort Worth\u2019s industrial market is strong. The region logged its 60th consecutive quarter of positive industrial space absorption, according to CBRE.\nLess than 3 percent of third-quarter deliveries were pre-leased, which caused the vacancy rate to rise 20 basis points in the third quarter to 9 percent. But that figure is expected to drop again, since the percentage of pre-leased products in the pipeline increased from 18.4 to 40 percent by the end of the third quarter.\nManufacturing drove most of the quarter\u2019s leasing demand. The most in-demand industrial submarkets in the region are South Dallas and Northwest Fort Worth, which is home to AllianceTexas, Hillwood\u2019s 27,000-acre mixed-use development and logistics hub.",

        "content": "Development buzz is growing on the Greenpoint waterfront.\nThe Jay Group has secured a $320 million construction loan for a 590-unit rental project at 97 West Street in Brooklyn. G4 Capital Partners provided the financing. Henry Bodek of Galaxy Capital brokered the transaction.\nIt\u2019s the third deal between The Jay Group and G4, according to the lender\u2019s co-managing partner Jason Behfarin. \u201cIt demonstrates our commitment to our experienced and capable sponsors,\u201d he said.\nThe neighborhood, at the northern tip of Brooklyn, has seen a spate of high-density residential development. The area was rezoned in 2005, allowing for residential construction in an area once dedicated to industrial activity.\nThe rental project at No. 97 is one of several planned developments along West Street. Down the street,\nTF Cornerstone is planning a 1,000-unit project\nat No. 45. And about 10 blocks north at Greenpoint Landing, Domain Companies, LMXD and Park Tower have proposed 1,000 units, 20,000 square feet of retail and a public park. About 300 units are set to be affordable.\nThe Jay Group has been active on the Greenpoint waterfront, with help from G4 Capital. The developer bought 101 Fleet Place in 2021 for $42.8 million, with a $130 million construction loan from G4, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. A 21-story residential tower is complete at the site.\nG4 also provided a $55 million loan to The Jay Group last year to buy six lots in the same area, 102-110 Fleet Place, 165 Willoughby and 275 Flatbush Extension, for $75 million, according to the Observer.\nThose lots were purchased from entities connected to Jack Guttman of Pearl Realty, who is currently connected to the most recent site, according to public records.\nIt\u2019s unclear if a sale has closed on the property; neither Guttman nor the Jay Group immediately responded to a request for comment. The ownership entity purchased the site for $7 million in 2001, when Jack\u2019s father Joshua Guttman was running the business.\nThe Guttmans were also behind the sale of No. 45 to TF Cornerstone for\n$175 million\n.\nJoshua Guttman\u2019s name gained notoriety in the 2000s after a multiple-day fire at the Greenpoint Warehouse Terminal, which he owned. Guttman weathered\nmedia suspicion\nthat he was connected to the blaze, as well as other fires at his properties. But another man, a homeless Polish immigrant named\nLeszek Kuczera\n, was charged with accidentally starting the fire when harvesting copper wire.\nIt\u2019s not yet clear if the Jay Group is targeting a tax abatement for the development. The city\u2019s current program,\n485x\n, makes building large-scale projects like a 590-unit development more difficult than previous tax abatement programs. In Greenpoint, developers need to pay their construction workers nearly $75 per hour for projects exceeding 150 units to be able to nab the abatement. That increases costs by about 29 percent over previous tax programs, according to calculations from the Real Estate Board of New York.\nG4 has elsewhere provided Rabsky Group with\n$320 million\nin construction financing for a Tribeca condo project and\n$286 million\nfor a Gowanus multifamily development.\n",

        "content": "My colleague Kathryn Brenzel wrote an\nintriguing article\nabout the Meatpacking District RFP, in which the city sought an \u201cemerging developer\u201d but did not choose one.\nInstead, the Economic Development Corporation selected a bid by Douglaston Development \u2014 a very experienced firm \u2014 and \u201cemerging developer\u201d David Himmel, a former COO at the big real estate company Jamestown and scion of a prominent real estate family.\nAlicia Glen, the former deputy mayor, said as a feminist she found the decision \u201cappalling and disgraceful.\u201d\nGlen is absolutely right that this was a missed opportunity for the city to help a female developer. But it\u2019s worth mentioning that the city had another priority: to create as much affordable housing as possible. For that, it tapped a proposal from an experienced team with ample access to capital.\nThe city and state often have various goals for their projects \u2014 low rent, community benefits, MWBE firms, union labor and more. Some are at odds with each other, and it\u2019s impossible to fulfill them all while also choosing a viable bid. The Meatpacking RFP for the former Gansevoort Meat Market site was a classic example.\nOne real estate professional told me soon after the RFP was issued that it looked like a challenging project, because of the affordability required and other factors, even though the city was offering a free 99-year lease for the land.\nThe winning bid will set aside up to 55 percent of the apartments as affordable and use no subsidy beyond the standard 485x, which requires high wages for construction workers. And it comes from Jeff Levine\u2019s Douglaston, which has 40 years of experience, and the well-credentialed Himmel.\nNothing in development is guaranteed, but Douglaston and Himmel are more likely to be able to raise the necessary capital and bring the project to fruition than a less experienced, less connected builder, and probably offer more affordability, too.\nHimmel obviously doesn\u2019t look like an emerging developer. And it\u2019s not great optics that EDC president and CEO Andrew Kimball also worked at Jamestown. But the families who win housing lotteries for the affordable units are not going to care.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhere will Andrew Kimball go when Zohran Mamdani becomes mayor? Whom will Mamdani pick to run the Economic Development Corporation? Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Under a\nlaw\njust signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul, landlords can no longer make a profit on a bounced-check fee passed on to a tenant. There is one exception: A landlord can still charge at least $20, even if the bank fee is less than that amount.\nElsewhere\u2026\nLast week, we were thinking about how Blackstone could be taking a heavy loss on a $1.8 billion portfolio of senior housing, an asset class experiencing a \u201cstrong rebound,\u201d according to Baker Tilly, and the population is aging.\nA reader responded by pointing out three factors that can make senior housing complicated to operate:\nIt has a lot of move-outs (including deaths)\nIn recessions or other times when it\u2019s hard for seniors to sell their homes, fewer can afford to move into senior housing\nPeople are staying in their homes longer than they used to, in part because of property tax discounts, and thus moving into senior housing later, which means shorter stays\nOne thing I know from experience is that even if moving into senior housing (or a doorman building) makes perfect sense, many older people will remain in houses and communities not conducive to aging in place. But that has always been true.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$13 million\nfor a four-bedroom co-op at 1050 Fifth Avenue in Carnegie Hill. Anne Z Easton with Douglas Elliman had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was $160 million for\n346 Madison Avenue\nand\n11 East 44th Street\nnear Grand Central Terminal. Claudio Del Vecchio sold the two properties to SL Green.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$12.25 million\nfor a 3,161-square-foot condominium unit at The Westbury, 15 East 69th Street in Lenox Hill. Anthony Pike of Douglas Elliman has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 37,360-square-foot, 12-story, 48-unit residential project at 2790 Creston Avenue in Fordham. Anthony Ng filed the permit on behalf of Long G Lin.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

The price works out to $68 per square foot.\nNew York-based\n601W\nturned to Sheridan to finance the acquisition, tapping the lender\u2019s appetite for complex deals with tight timelines. Aaron Kurlansky and Michael Yassky led the origination for Sheridan, which also announced two additional loans that same week, including an $18 million multifamily deal in Baton Rouge and a $4 million healthcare facility loan in Minnesota.\nThe Van Buren property is 36 percent leased, with Tropicana and the federal government\u2019s GSA as tenants in the high-vacancy asset. It sits directly across from 601W\u2019s flagship redevelopment of the\nOld Post Office\nand a block away from transit hub Union Station \u2014 a key selling point in a sluggish office leasing environment.\n601W has a track record of taking on large, distressed or underperforming buildings and repositioning them, often with an eye toward modern amenities or conversions.\nDetails on 601W\u2019s plans for the West Loop building weren\u2019t disclosed, but the firm had explored repositioning the nearby former Northern Trust office building just to the south at\n801 South Canal Street\nas an upgraded office building. But the landlord later backed away from those plans and is toying with converting it\ninto a data center asset\n.\nThe submarket in the southwest portion of the Loop and just over the river to the southern portion of the West Loop has struggled with vacancy, but the Van Buren Street building\u2019s proximity to 601W\u2019s existing holdings may offer cost and operational synergies.\n601W is also in talks to buy the severely distressed\n175 West Jackson Boulevard\njust to the east, after landlord Brookfield defaulted on a massive loan tied to the property amid the depths of the pandemic.\nSheridan, meanwhile, is positioning itself as a go-to bridge lender in a market still plagued by high interest rates and valuation resets. Its bet on 601W signals confidence not just in the borrower\u2019s execution but in the long-term viability of well-located office assets, even those with leasing challenges.\nThe transaction comes amid a wave of distressed office sales in Chicago, as institutional owners look to cut losses or exit troubled assets. For 601W, the Van Buren pickup is a discounted play next to one of its crown jewels \u2014 and now, another shot at a turnaround.\n",

Pappas\u2019 office published two reports that found that Illinois property tax law was negatively affecting\nhomeowners\nwho got behind on their tax bills.\nThe law allowed tax buyers to avoid paying based on\ntypos\nor other small errors regarding how the property is described on government websites, and Pappas\u2019 office sent legislation to Springfield to remedy the situation in 2023.\nEarlier this summer, a federal judge just gave hundreds of homeowners the green light to\nsue Cook County\nover tax lien sales, granting class-action status to a lawsuit filed in 2022 by former homeowners and housing groups alleging the county\u2019s embattled tax sale process\nstrips property owners of their equity\n, in violation of the U.S. Constitution, allowing the case to move forward on behalf of as many as 1,700 Cook County homeowners.\nThe\nlawsuit\nalleges that Cook County\u2019s tax sale process violates the U.S. Constitution by stripping property owners of their equity, citing the 2023 Supreme Court decision in Tyler v. Hennepin County.\nPappas\nargued the county was simply following state law and that any pocketed excess value was going to those private tax buyers, and Illinois is the only state affected by the Tyler ruling that\nhasn\u2019t changed its laws\n. Around the same time Pappas postponed this year\u2019s tax sale to 2026 in hopes lawmakers would act.\nAnd a\ntax study\nfrom her office this month warned taxpayers that their incoming delayed bills will once again show increases, partly due to a sharp decline in Loop commercial property values.\n",

Talonvest Capital\u2019s Kim Bishop arranged the deal.\nThe development will span 175,000 square feet across five stories. The ground floor will have light industrial space, while the top four stories will have self-storage. National\nself-storage\ncompany Extra Space will manage the property.\nThe project, in San Francisco\u2019s Produce Market neighborhood, is one of just two self-storage developments approved in San Francisco since 2002, Multi-Housing News\nreported\n. The city banned the development of new purpose-built self-storage facilities in 2006 after the city eliminated storage as a permitted use in most districts.\nDECA got its foot in the door by finding a zoning technicality in San Francisco\u2019s southern industrial area, which includes the Produce Market district.\nIt secured entitlements for the project through this loophole. San Francisco\nremoved\nthe city\u2019s Industrial Protection Zone designation for the area three years ago, closing off any future development opportunities. As such, DECA\u2019s project will be the last self-storage development in the city for the foreseeable future.\nThe San Francisco metro has a limited supply of self-storage space, relatively speaking. There are about 24.1 million square feet of rentable space across 405 facilities in the region. That works out to about 2.8 square feet per person of rentable space. Nearly half of San Francisco\u2019s 4.7 million residents are renters.\nThe\nself-storage sector has added 547 million square feet\nover the past decade across the country.\nThe growth is largely concentrated in cities high in multifamily construction, and specifically in regions where the share of residents living in apartments grew while home ownership decreased.\nAs San Francisco sees an\ninflux of renters in the ongoing artificial intelligence boom\n, the city must wrestle with its anti-development sentiments among residents and officials while working to meet its\nstate-mandated goal\nof 82,069 new housing units by 2030.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Graham Development\u2019s high-profile plan to remake a stretch of\nSouth Congress\nAvenue may hinge on an old East Austin landfill that Travis County is aiming to seize.\nCounty commissioners voted this week to use eminent domain to acquire the 150-acre site at 9500 East Highway 290, a move that could derail Graham\u2019s mixed-use project nearly 15 miles away, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe landfill is the lynchpin because Graham needs it to house a scrapyard \u2014\nLKQ Auto Salvage\n\u2014 that sits on its development site, at 7900 South Congress.\nThe scrapyard holds a lease through 2036, making redevelopment impossible unless it moves. Graham Development and the landowner, Moo Moo Meadows, sued Travis County in July, alleging the county illegally blocked the scrapyard\u2019s relocation while failing to address long-standing contamination at the landfill.\nCounty officials say the East Austin tract is needed for landfill maintenance, repair and potential parkland, though no cost estimate was disclosed. A spokesperson declined to elaborate on why the acquisition is necessary. An unsigned resolution in the meeting packet shows the parties failed to agree on voluntary acquisition terms.\nIf the county takes the site,\nGraham Development\npartner Corbin Graham said he will lose his only viable landing spot for LKQ. He told the outlet that scrapyards require ultra-low-cost land \u2014 under $4 per square foot \u2014 which simply doesn\u2019t exist along\nSouth Congress\nor Highway 290.\nA closed landfill fits the bill, in his view, because the use relies mostly on storing cars on compacted gravel rather than building structures that would demand costly engineering on unstable ground.\nEnvironmental issues at the landfill are well documented.\nThe site stopped accepting waste in 1982, and tests earlier this year found unsafe levels of arsenic, barium and lead in leachate and groundwater, according to the lawsuit. Graham and Moo Moo Meadows argue the county ignored years of directives from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to close and remediate the site and overstepped its authority in blocking the scrapyard move.\nGraham\u2019s proposed\nSouth Congress\ndevelopment is substantial: 1,218 apartments, 210,000 square feet of office space, 136,000 square feet of retail and an affordable housing component.\nTo salvage it, he\u2019s pitching a tax increment reinvestment zone that could generate roughly $20 million toward cleanup, alongside $10 million the county has budgeted. But until the eminent-domain fight is resolved, the future of one of South Austin\u2019s biggest potential redevelopments remains stuck behind a scrapyard.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Deed records show the deal closed in late August. The three-story building covers 1.24 acres just outside downtown and a few blocks from the\nStockyards\n.\nCHC has already kicked off a round of improvements, targeting restrooms, common areas and exterior lighting, as well as a new conference and break room. Ground-floor space is being marketed for retail and restaurants. The upgrades are expected to wrap next year.\nBlueAlpha founder Sanjay Chandra said the building\u2019s newer construction, vintage character and strong frontage on North Main Street made the deal appealing.\nThe sale marks the property\u2019s first local ownership since it was built in 2006, CHC\u2019s Rory Maguire said. His firm owns the Vinnedge Building a block away, which is about 95 percent leased, and he\u2019s aiming for a similar outcome at the Mercado.\nMaguire said demand for Northside office space is surging, drawing global tenants and luring companies out of downtown.\nThe\nNorth Main corridor\nis also getting attention through Main Street America, a $650,000 pilot program backed by the\nFort Worth\nLocal Development Corporation aimed at revitalizing underserved areas.\nLocal developers are plotting new uses for empty buildings nearby, while the Fort Worth Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and the Urban Land Institute have been studying tools to curb displacement in the predominantly Hispanic Historic Northside.\nBlueAlpha and CHC say they\u2019re working with the Hispanic Chamber as they lease the building, framing the project as an effort to elevate the corridor without pushing out legacy businesses. The Northside sees an estimated 300,000 visitors annually and has a 3.7 percent retail vacancy rate, but no meaningful construction in more than a decade.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The firm financed the purchase with a $117 million loan from San Francisco-based Acore Capital.\nThe seller, New York-based Morgan Stanley, acquired the assemblage in 2014 as part of a larger portfolio deal valued at\n$342 million\n, records show. At the time, Morgan Stanley bought the properties from Coral Gables-based Terranova, which retained a stake.\nCurrent tenants include The Cheesecake Factory, Salt &amp; Straw, It\u2019Sugar and Lincoln Eatery.\nComras\nplans to transform the properties into a 150,000-square-foot boutique shopping district called NoLi, which is short for North Lincoln Road, the release states. The district will entail Via NoLi, an 18-foot-wide paseo carved through the 700 block of\nLincoln Road\n, connecting to North Lincoln Lane. Via NoLi will be lined with boutique storefronts and culinary destinations.\nThe project will also have NoLi Plaza, which will consist of caf\u00e9 seating, a central fountain and greenery, and North Lincoln Lane will be transformed from a service alley into a pedestrian walkway featuring storefronts, expanded sidewalks with cafes and outdoor seating, the release states. Retail spaces will range from about 400 square feet to 4,000 square feet.\nThe portfolio was set to be sold to another buyer. Duane Reade drugstore\u2019s Cohen family was under contract to buy the buildings for more than $150 million, but the deal fell apart when the Cohens were unable to land an equity partner or secure a loan, published reports state.\nFounded in 1992, Comras also has a leasing brokerage division and owns other properties on Lincoln Road, including 635-639, 701 and 734-744 Lincoln Road, according to the company\u2019s website. Comras\u2019 Lincoln Road tenants include Aldo, Swarovski and Hoka.\nIn 2015, Comras sold the block at 1001-1035 Lincoln Road to Pontegadea, the family office of Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega, for\n$370 million\n.\nLincoln Road\nhas gone through a downturn in recent years as the outdoor pedestrian shopping street has lost national tenants to newer competing retail and dining destinations such as the Miami Design District and Wynwood. Many storefronts are currently vacant, and the Regal South Beach movie theater is shuttered. But landlords and brokers say Lincoln Road is averaging an occupancy rate of 77 percent, and a new influx of tenants are building out some of the empty spaces.",

Instead, the administration cut a deal with local Council member Chris Marte, who agreed to support the rezoning of three other sites that would net 620 affordable units, more than 400 apartments than were planned for the garden site.\nThe reversal drew criticism from City Council leaders, housing advocates, developers and other elected officials. The decision came after years of\nlitigation\n, in which the city eventually\nsecured\nits ability to evict the nonprofit that leases the Nolita garden.\nIn the lawsuit, the development team points out that the administration abandoned a \u201cshovel-ready\u201d project for ones that are far from certain. It also questions the relationship between Mastro and attorney Norman Siegel, who had represented the nonprofit, and Adams\u2019 former chief of staff, Frank Carone, who has supported opponents of Haven Green. The administration\u2019s reversal came after Mastro was made first deputy mayor in March and announced he was \u201creviewing the project.\u201d\nAhead of the November election, Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani\nindicated\nthat he would move forward with Haven Green and evict the garden. After the Adams administration declared the land a park, Mamdani told reporters that pursuing the project would be \u201c\nnearly impossible\n.\u201d Using city parkland for other uses would require action by the state legislature.\nThe lawsuit argues that allowing the mayor to declare the site parkland outside the legal process will have far-reaching implications.\n\u201cIf allowed to stand, Respondents\u2019 actions would establish dangerous precedents: that the Mayor, or any mayoral agency, could unilaterally overturn a completed ULURP by executive fiat; that a land-use decision duly vetted, debated, and approved by the City Council may be silently reversed without public process; and that the rule of law governing New York City\u2019s land-use system can be disregarded and displaced by political convenience and preference,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cThat is not what the City Charter mandates, and it is not how a lawful government functions.\u201d\nRepresentatives for the mayor did not immediately return requests seeking comment.\n",

The acquisition was part of a larger\n$155 million\nacquisition of South Florida senior living facilities the same year.\nNew York-based\nBlackstone\n, led by Stephen Schwarzman, is in the midst of offloading a national portfolio of senior living properties that resulted in heavy losses for the institutional investment giant.\nAventura-based\nBH Group\n, led by Isaac and Liat Toledano, and Fort Lauderdale-based\nGold Standard of Care\n, partnered to acquire Blackstone\u2019s senior living assets in South Florida, the release states.

        "content": "Tensions over the lack of transparency in \u201cwho\u2019s calling the shots\u201d on the fire recovery boiled over this week as a contractor sought approval of $8 million for rebuilding work.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of false starts from the beginning of this, from the mayor appointing someone to be the director of this recovery to that [person] abandoning ship, to then [disaster recovery firm]\nHagerty\n\u2014 we are 10 months [post-fires] \u2026. This is bullshit,\u201d Councilwoman Monica Rodriguez said during the\nAd Hoc Committee for LA Recovery\nspecial meeting on Monday. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that we\u2019re in a situation where we\u2019re still here. It feels like we\u2019re circling the drain, and I don\u2019t know who\u2019s calling the shots from the mayor\u2019s office.\u201d\nRodriguez, who is a member of the ad hoc committee, was responding to a request made to her and her peers to approve moving $8 million from the city budget to the Bureau of Engineering. That money would be used to pay for work\nAECOM\non current rebuilding efforts and map out the long-term recovery.\nThe requested $8 million won\u2019t be\u00a0 paid to AECOM immediately. Rather, the allocation, which was ultimately approved with stipulations, will make the money available for the Bureau of Engineering to pay the firm as work is delivered.\nWith little to show since AECOM\u2019s contract was announced in June, Rodriguez voiced frustration over the money request.\n\u201cWhy are we continuing to play with all these other things [related to the long-term] when all it\u2019s doing is delaying the implementation of an actual plan to get shovels into the ground immediately?\u201d Rodriguez asked.\nTraci Park, who chairs the ad hoc committee, expressed concern about whether there was a less costly option, considering \u201cI can\u2019t even find funding for the Department of Building and Safety to hire an outside contractor to clear the toxic debris and rubble out of the Palisades Bowl.\u201d\nThe Pacific Palisades Bowl Mobile Estates community on Pacific Coast Highway remains uncleared, preventing tenants from returning and also creating what Park called a \u201ctoxic soup.\u201d\nRepresentatives for Rodriguez did not respond to a request for comment on the councilmember\u2019s statements.\nThe mayor\u2019s office responded to the critiques generally instead of directly addressing Rodriguez or Park.\n\u201cWhile some in the city criticize without providing solutions, Mayor Bass remains focused on leading the fastest disaster recovery effort in modern California history and on getting families home \u2014 full stop,\u201d a spokesperson from the mayor\u2019s office said in a statement provided to\nThe Real Deal\non Tuesday. \u201cMayor Bass recognizes that recovering from a disaster of this magnitude requires working with all levels of government, philanthropic partners and experts in the private sector to get families home. She will continue to do that.\u201d\nApproved with contingencies\nThe contract with AECOM, which has headquarters in Dallas and an office in Downtown Los Angeles, was a follow-on move to a work solicitation first released by the city in January. That solicitation ultimately led to AECOM being tapped in May for work that included overarching management of the recovery plan, infrastructure restoration and fire protection planning and logistics and traffic management.\nThe total cost of that work was $5 million and due in 120 days. Additional work on longer-term planning was then added by Mayor Karen Bass\u2019 office, tacking on another $3 million.\nAECOM began work earlier this year meeting with residents and city departments, in addition to working on three plans that are viewed as key to supporting the massive construction zone that\u2019s expected in the Palisades in the coming years. Those three outlines address infrastructure restoration, fire protection and logistics and operations.\nThe three reports have not been presented to the ad hoc recovery committee, prompting the three members present at Monday\u2019s meeting to approve paying AECOM an amount not to exceed $5 million for the work that\u2019s been done. Any additional payments are subject to review and approval by the committee, once they see the three reports within the next month.\n\u201cBotched\u201d job\nRodriguez\u2019s comments come as the one-year anniversary of the\nPalisades and Eaton fires\nlooms, with much of the public communication on the recovery being spearheaded by Bass\u2019 office.\nHow decisions are being made within the mayor\u2019s office was\u00a0 a key question asked Monday, given several key decisions being made without full council approval.\nIn July, Rodriguez confirmed to\nTRD\nshe had learned of the contracts with Hagerty and AECOM at the same time as the public, when Bass\u2019 office issued press releases.\n\u201cThe challenge I have \u2014 and this is not about AECOM \u2014 it\u2019s just procedurally how things are being authorized is we\u2019re being forced to be pot committed,\u201d Rodriguez said during Monday\u2019s meeting. \u201cThat is, you\u2019ve gone ahead, and you started doing all of this [community] engagement and work and now they come to us and say, \u2018Oh, by the way, you\u2019re not going to get the final product until you approve an $8 million transfer\u2019\u2026. That\u2019s just not how business should be done.\u201d\nRodriguez said Bass\u2019 office \u201ctotally botched the first few months of this recovery.\u201d\nTo date, the mayor has tapped developer Steve Soboroff in January to serve as chief recovery officer. Well publicized disputes related to pay and Soboroff\u2019s scope of authority led to the severing of ties after 90 days in the position. That was followed up with the mayor\u2019s office announcing in February a contract struck with Illinois-based disaster recovery firm\nHagerty Consulting\nfor what a spokesperson in the mayor\u2019s office described earlier this year as \u201cplanning, response, recovery, financial management and operations.\u201d\nThe Hagerty contract was not to exceed $10 million, according to the contract. The deal was criticized from the time it was announced for the lack of transparency around the approval process as some wondered about the qualifications of an out-of-state firm.\nA late October report from the City Administrative Officer confirmed similarities in the work of Hagerty and AECOM, indicating the \u201cphasing out of Hagerty\u2019s support\u201d last month.\n",

The sublease runs through CNA\u2019s existing term, which marketing materials show stretches to May 2035.\nShamrock, which operates a collection of logistics, finance and tech-related businesses serving shippers, is chasing the same recruiting edge that\u2019s brought other suburban companies downtown.\nThe dual-office setup is meant to help the firm court recent grads who want an urban address, while still appealing to experienced professionals eyeing suburban commutes, the company\u2019s Vice President of Real Estate Matt Huderski told the outlet. The Chicago office will be Shamrock\u2019s 11th nationwide.\nShamrock plans to hire 100 people downtown and 30 more in Lombard by the end of next year, doubling its Chicago-area headcount.\nThat growth puts Shamrock in line with a broader surge of logistics-related companies bulking up Chicago offices since 2020.\nArrive Logistics\n, MoLo Solutions, Loadsmart, Spot Logistics and Total Quality Logistics have all expanded in the city, reinforcing Chicago\u2019s long-running status as a freight and supply-chain hub.\nThe move lands squarely against the prevailing tide of companies cutting space or abandoning the city\u2019s core. Downtown vacancy is near record highs as hybrid work thins demand.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The eight-bedroom estate was built last year by\ndeveloper Joe Farrell\n.\nThe 1.24-acre property initially asked just under $80 million when it hit the market in April 2024.

The estate is no longer being offered for sale, though it has hit the market for rent several times, asking $1 million for about a month-long stay.\nFarrell, CEO of the eponymous development firm, announced last week that he bought an oceanfront home at 42 Deforest Road in Montauk for $17 million, a record-high price for the neighborhood of Ditch Plains Beach,\nBehind the Hedges\nreported.

Grousbeck, who bought the team in 2002 for $360 million, ceded his seat as governor of the team as part of the deal, though he is remaining on board until Chisholm takes over the rest of the company in 2028.\nAmong the investors\nin Chisholm\u2019s group is Bruce Beal, Jr., the president of Related Companies.

        "content": "Los Angeles\u2019 Executive Directive 1\nhas made all-affordable housing the most competitive development play in the city.\nDevelopers are increasingly opting to build 100 percent affordable apartments as a way of getting projects through the approval pipeline faster, as entitlement timelines shrink from about a year for market-rate projects to 60 days for fully affordable endeavors, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n.\nSince the city rolled out ED1 in late 2022, developers have filed plans for about 42,300 income-restricted units, with roughly 31,700, or 75 percent approved so far. That\u2019s more than double the city\u2019s affordable approvals in the three years before ED1. The directive allows applicants to bypass public hearings and council votes for projects restricted to tenants earning no more than 80 percent of\narea median income\n; in Los Angeles County, that\u2019s $84,850 for one person.\n\u201cEfforts like ED1 show that there\u2019s plenty of appetite to build nonluxury apartments by market-rate developers,\u201d said Jason Ward, co-director of the RAND Center on Housing and Homelessness. \u201cYou just have to create the circumstances to do that.\u201d\nLast year, five developers from across the country joined forces to create Passo, a Los Angeles-based entity designed to take advantage of ED1. So far, the venture has finished one project totaling 15 units, and it has more than 600 more units in construction and planning phases. Passo shaved months off the entitlement timeline and tens of thousands of dollars in fees by tapping ED1.\n\u201cED1 is the only reason we came out here,\u201d Passo principal Daniel Glimcher said. \u201cMarket-rate multifamily just really doesn\u2019t pencil out in L.A.\u201d\nStill, developers face hurdles in getting their projects across the finish line \u2014 namely, when it comes to paying for them. Higher interest rates and slower lending, combined with the city\u2019s Housing Authority\u2019s recent cut to\nSection 8\nsubsidies, present challenges in advancing fully affordable projects. The controversial Measure ULA transfer tax is also repelling some investors.\nAt the same time, Mayor Karen Bass has imposed new limits, such as removing single-family areas from ED1 eligibility and tightening\nincentives\nand fee waivers. Some developers who jumped in early are now trying to flip their entitled sites rather than build, SoLa Impact CEO Martin Muoto told the outlet.\n\u201cMarket-rate housing [construction] has been essentially canceled at this point,\u201d Chris Aiello, founding partner at Six Peak,\ntold\nCoStar. \u201cVirtually no land makes sense from an investment perspective to build market rate.\u201d\nCalifornia has been working to cut red tape to build affordable housing in an effort to stamp out chronic housing shortages.\nOver the summer, Gov. Gavin Newsom\nrolled back provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act\n, which frequently bogged down developments in the review process. The City of Los Angeles must\npermit\n456,643 new homes by 2029, though even with the boost in building thanks to ED1, the city remains far off from that goal.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The price wasn\u2019t disclosed.\nThe sellers were Spencer Hough, Tommy Le of 3 Real Estate Group, and George Giannukos. JLL\u2019s investment sales team, led by John Indelli and Ryan West, represented the sellers, with analytical support from Dawson Hastings and Max Myers.\nAnchored by Seiwa Market, an 11,000-square-foot Japanese grocer, Ashford Village sits at 1801 South Dairy Ashford Road and is 100 percent leased. Other tenants include Dollar Tree, Book Off, Goldfish Swim School, Giggles and Fun and Salon Village. Seven of the center\u2019s 15 tenants cater to Asian consumers, a demographic that has surged 23.6 percent in the surrounding area since 2010, JLL noted.\nThat population trend is central to\nWhitestone\u2019s\nthesis. The Memorial\u2013Briar Forest pocket just north of Bellaire\u2019s Asiatown has been drawing upwardly mobile households seeking more space without straying far from established cultural hubs. Tim Ng, Whitestone\u2019s VP of acquisitions, told the Chronicle that Asian families often migrate outward from Asiatown as incomes rise, with Memorial emerging as a preferred destination.\nThe 1979-built center, last renovated in 2014, also checks broader location boxes. It\u2019s near major employment hubs in the Westchase District and\nEnergy Corridor\nand fronts a busy stretch of Dairy Ashford that sees roughly 32,500 vehicles a day.\nHouston\u2019s chronic westward population growth and the tight supply of new retail \u2014 constrained by construction costs and high occupancy \u2014 have made stabilized centers like Ashford Village increasingly competitive. JLL said the property drew multiple offers even before formally hitting the market.\nThe deal lands amid a flurry of Houston\nretail trades\n. On the same day Whitestone closed, Baker Katz snapped up the 108,000-square-foot Lakewood Forest Shopping Center, its biggest buy in three years. Days later, Baltimore-based Continental Realty entered the market with its purchase of the 442,000-square-foot Commons at Willowbrook, its first Houston acquisition.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Developers on Tuesday laid out the \u201ccontours of a plan\u201d for seven remaining sites at Pacific Park in Brooklyn, describing a development that would add thousands of housing units to what was previously approved.\nDuring a public workshop, executives from Cirrus Real Estate Partners and LCOR, the project\u2019s new development team, pitched a plan that would result in taller, but fewer towers, and ultimately net 9,000 housing units for the megadevelopment (including those already built). The previous plan called for a total of 6,430 units.\nIf this version is pursued, the development would include five towers, instead of six, on sites that will require a platform to be built over active train tracks between Pacific Street and Atlantic Avenue. Density from the eliminated tower, dubbed B8 and located at the corner of Carlton and Atlantic avenues, would be shifted to the other sites. Meanwhile, B8 would become green space.\nThe total development, formerly called Atlantic Yards and first proposed over two decades ago, would result in 9.6 million square feet, compared to the previously planned 8 million. The average height of the project\u2019s buildings would be 550 feet, instead of 350 feet.\nThe proposals are not final, and any changes will require amendments to the state\u2019s general project plan, a method outside the city\u2019s land use process that lays out the parameters of a project. That will be a separate process from the public workshops.\nIt remains to be seen how community members and elected officials, long critical of how the project has been carried out, will feel about the final framework as it takes shape.\nA taller, more feasible vision\n\u201cWe\u2019re here tonight to present a feasible plan, not the final plan,\u201d said LCOR\u2019s Anthony Tortora.\nThe changes, according to the developers, would speed up construction of housing, while also ensuring that more open space is part of the plan.\nCirrus\u2019 Joseph McDonnell explained that shifting residential density from B8, which presented logistical challenges, would lead to faster housing construction. Most of that square footage would be moved to solid ground, rather than atop a platform. In other words, to areas where it is easier to build.\n\u201cThis is a very constrained site. We\u2019re not here to sugarcoat it,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to take what we\u2019ve been given, and it\u2019s imperfect, it\u2019s an imperfect plan from a very imperfect development, and try to achieve more affordability and more open space.\u201d\nThe development team, he said, is guided by wanting to build \u201cmore affordable housing sooner,\u201d to add more contiguous open space and to ensure the affordable housing is available to a range of income levels. Given those concepts, he said it may make sense not to build on B8.\n\u201cI think what separates us is the thought around restraint,\u201d he said,\nThe team also proposed shifting development rights from a public plaza in front of Barclays \u2014\u00a0once envisioned as a Frank Gehry-designed office tower called \u201cMiss Brooklyn\u201d \u2014\u00a0to build two towers on what is known as\nsite 5\n, across the street from Barclays and currently home to a\u00a0 P.C. Richard &amp; Son and a former Modell\u2019s that was recently\nconverted\ninto a youth basketball training facility. Tuesday\u2019s workshop was held at the latter.\nThe towers on site 5 would rise a maximum of 775 feet, higher than the previously approved 620 feet, though even taller towers were previously\ncontemplated\n. The developers are thinking of focusing the income levels of the affordable units on moderate- to middle-income tenants, with rents capped at levels affordable to those earning at most 130 percent of the area median income. The previously approved rents were affordable to those earning between 40 percent and 160 percent of the AMI.\nDecades of delays\nEven the presentation of a rough draft of a new plan for Pacific Park represents a step forward for the long-delayed project. The project was first\nannounced\nin 2003, and in the two decades since, it has faced various legal and economic challenges, in addition to the individual financial troubles of the developers who have come and gone from the project.\nNine buildings (including the Barclays Center) have been completed as part of the project, with more than 3,200 apartments built, by original developers Forest City Ratner, Greenland USA and other developers who, over the years, have taken over individual sites.\nA joint venture led by Cirrus and LCOR\ntook over\nthe remaining seven sites (eight when including the plaza\u2019s development rights) through a foreclosure auction last month, after Greenland USA defaulted on nearly $350 million in loans tied to the properties. Greenland, as well as the U.S. Immigration Fund and Fortress, are also part of the joint venture, but won\u2019t have an active role in managing the development\nEmpire State Development, the state agency overseeing the project, held the workshop on Tuesday to solicit general feedback from the community about what they would like to see accomplished by the project. This was the first of four workshops planned, and the first time the development team publicly provided information about their visions for the sites.\nAt one table during the workshop, attendees said they wanted to see \u201ctruly affordable housing,\u201d more oversight of the project and, ultimately, they wanted the project to be completed.\nThe workshop got off to a bumpy start when the venue\u2019s microphone broke and ESD tried to move forward with the presentation without one. That didn\u2019t go over well with some attendees who declared that they couldn\u2019t hear the first speaker.\nAfter a brief delay, ESD procured a replacement microphone from P.C. Richards next door.\nSome elected officials attended the workshop, including Assembly member Jo Anne Simon, Council member Shahana Hanif and Sen. Jabari Brisport. Several attendees were also wearing shirts with union logos, including from the Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America. Construction union pension funds will help finance Pacific Park, as part of a deal Cirrus reached with the city and the Building and Construction Trades Council last year.\nHanif, whose district includes site 5, said she viewed the workshop as a \u201cfresh start.\u201d She noted her concern with penalties that Greenland was supposed to pay for failing to meet a May 2025 deadline.\nUnder a 2014 agreement, the developer was required to finish the project\u2019s 2,250 affordable apartments (at this point, 876 are left) by the end of May, or pay $2,000 per unfinished unit for every month that the apartments went without a temporary certificate of occupancy.\nBut when Greenland failed to meet the deadline, ESD declined to enforce the penalties, citing concerns that the developer would sue and further delay the project. Instead, the new development team will pay $12 million toward an affordable housing fund, which will be paid in installments. The state has emphasized, however, that it retains the right to collect penalties if future benchmarks are not met.\n\u201cThey sort of got away with it,\u201d Hanif said of the fines, while acknowledging that she understood the state\u2019s concerns over litigation. \u201cI think it is going to be important if things mess up, that the penalties that are in place, the accountability measures that are in place, really do get implemented and are adhered to by the developer management team.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A condo was one of\nAustin\u2019s top sales\nlast week, disrupting a long streak of single-family dominance.\nUnit 48Y in the Austonian was the second-priciest public residential sale in the city, according to the Eklund Gomes Team. The sale price is undisclosed, but the sellers, E. Dale and Nancy Lowe, were asking $3.75 million, or $1,442 per square foot, when the condo sold.\nThe 2,600-square-foot condo has three bedrooms, four bathrooms and \u201cthe signature view\u201d of the capitol and the University of Texas campus, said listing agent Trey Phillips of Eric Moreland Group.\nIts layout is unique to the building, he said. It was designed by local architect Ryan Street.\nFor the past few weeks, homes in Barton Creek and other\nwestern neighborhoods\nhave led sales. Last week, though, both of the top two sales were centrally located, with a single-family home about a mile from the Austonian taking the top spot.\nAgents tend to list downtown properties\npublicly\nbecause there\u2019s less of a discrepancy between property tax appraisals and actual market values compared to West Austin homes, Phillips said.\nBuilt in 2010 by Benchmark Development and Grupo Villar Mir\n, the Austonian is\none of Austin\u2019s first condo towers\n. Prices declined after 2022, but downtown Austin condos are seeing demand from downsizing seniors, traveling executives who need second homes, and young professionals.\n\u201cThe buyer that is buying it is local. He splits time between here and the East Coast, but his primary residence is Austin. And, life phase-wise, he\u2019s an empty nester, so he doesn\u2019t need a big house any longer,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThat\u2019s our number-one buyer profile, folks coming from big, beautiful homes in West Austin.\u201d\nIt\u2019s been weeks since a condo landed in the top two sales, but a\nW Residences\ncondo asking $4.75 million sold at the end of September. A\n$5 million unit at Independent\nsold in February, and there were\ntwo condo sales over $2 million in one week\nin March. A\n$6.75 million home at the Four Seasons Residences\nsold in April.\n",

That works out to $1,031 per square foot.\nThe seller was Teachers Insurance &amp; Annuity Association of America, which had owned it since 2012.

In August, MacMahon\nbought the seven-story One Union Square building\nfor $42.5 million.

Alaska-based Fountainhead Development\nbought 800 Market Street\n, dubbed the \u201cflatiron\u201d of San Francisco, for $17.2 million last month.

The expansion of the relevant zone, notably, is not the same as Related receiving its desired tax break.\nThe 15-person board \u2014 partially stacked with mayoral appointees \u2014 almost unanimously approved the change to the Uniform Tax Exemption Policy. The exception was Comptroller Brad Lander, who supports the project, but not its use of city funds.\n\u201cWe are concerned that in its current configuration, the economics of the project appear to rely too heavily on the city\u2019s intervention to the benefit of the private developer and the MTA,\u201d Lander said in a statement.\nRelated did not comment on the vote to the outlet.\nJeff Blau\u2019s firm is seeking a $2 billion tax break from the city to fund the construction of a platform over the open rail tracks. Critics of the proposed tax break view it as a bailout for the developer to build a large project on the taxpayer dime.\nUltimately, Related is looking to build four mixed-use towers on the site that will deliver approximately 4,000 residential units, green space and a school.\nThe City Council\napproved\nthe rezoning of the site back in June, a month after Related dropped its bid to put a casino on the site. The changes to the 2009 rezoning of the site also allowed for an office building and a hotel.\nRelated previously indicated that the housing units will primarily be rentals. The Adams administration announced the developer had committed to a\nminimum of 625 affordable apartments\n, up from 400. The pledge is likely driven by affordability requirements of\nthe 485x property tax break\n.\nTo score its IDA tax break, Related will still need to complete the IDA application and review process, which could take roughly three months. That means Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani\u2019s administration \u2014 which\nBlau reportedly sought to prevent\nby rallying fellow business bigwigs \u2014 will likely have a say in whether or not Related actually lands the financing.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner",

The city\u2019s Planning, Zoning and Appeals Board approved the proposal in October, and the commission will vote on it on Thursday on first reading. The measure requires a second reading vote.\nThe proposal would target high demand areas, but only two have been identified, and both are in Edgewater, stretching from the Julia Tuttle Causeway south to Northeast Eighth Street, according to Spotlight. It would also include\nWatson Island\n, where a pair of new projects are planned.\nCommissioner Damian Pardo is sponsoring the legislation.\nThe fund would pay for projects like raising streets, replacing\nseawalls\nand installing pump stations. The money collected by the city would generally have to stay in the same area, and any development that costs more than $100,000 would require commission approval.\nIncreasing density could put further strain on infrastructure and accelerate gentrification even more, critics said.\nEdgewater\u2019s streets will flood during a rainstorm, damaging cars and homes. The neighborhood is also experiencing a huge increase in new developments. Last month, the Miami Urban Development Review Board approved\nthe design\nfor a 47-story mixed-use high-rise with nearly 500 apartments for the site at 3350 Biscayne Boulevard, which is for sale. Black Salmon, the Boschetti Group and Constellation Group also recently announced they are partnering with hospitality mogul Sam Nazarian to launch a\nbranded condo tower\nat 422 Northeast 29th Street.\nAaron DeMayo, who chairs the city\u2019s Climate Resilience Committee, supports the proposal, but said he found it \u201csomewhat ironic that we\u2019re incentivizing additional development capacity in an area that obviously is already flooding significantly.\u201d\n\u2014 Katherine Kallergis\n",

Their firm specializes in restoring Hollywood Regency, Mid-Century Modern and Victorian properties.\nThe Hollywood Regency-style residence on Blue Jay Way boasts glass doors with views of the city and ocean.\nThe five-bedroom, seven-bathroom home spans 9,800 square feet. Amenities include a 14-seat screening room, 500-bottle wine cellar and spa. On the roof is a garden with more than 80 fruit trees. Also growing are vegetables, strawberries and herbs.\nNot far behind the Bird Streets home was last week\u2019s second-largest signed contract based on asking price. That would be a lower Bel-Air home at 10820 Ambazac Way, asking nearly $14 million, or $3,654 per square foot.\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\u2019s Weston Littlefield and Aaron Kirman have the listing.\nThe seller is a family trust managed by Jerry Ivery, according to records in PropertyShark.\nThe 1954-built home has three bedrooms and five baths across 3,839 square feet, plus views of the Bel-Air Country Club\u2019s 17th hole.\nIt\u2019s big on outdoor entertainment with a tiki hut bar, pool and three hot tubs.\nIn Los Angeles County, 12 homes went into contract, good for $112.1 million in asking volume, which was up about 38 percent year over year, according to the Eklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles.\nThe team\u2019s weekly roundup counts only properties listed in the Multiple Listing Service with an asking price of at least $4 million.\nSigned contracts\noffer one view of the market\u2019s health, but they\u2019re not necessarily guarantees of closings.\nClosed L.A. County residential deals of $4 million or more increased 10.4 percent over the 90-day period ended Nov. 12, compared to a year ago, according to MLS data pulled by Westside Estate Agency.

But if it sells for its asking price, it would be the record sale for New Buffalo, beating an off-market deal for $8.5 million in 2023.\nAt 11781 Marquette Drive, the home has eight bedrooms and seven-and-a-half bathrooms. It sits on a half-acre lot on the Lake Michigan shoreline and has 7,200 square-feet of living space.\nThe home, built in 2020, has large windows that look out over Lake Michigan.

Mcnaughton bought the land in 2019 for $1.85 million and the house was constructed in 2020.\nThe potential sale follows other big deals in New Buffalo this fall that have put demand for luxury waterfront homes in the area on vivid display. The town is a popular vacation spot for Chicagoans and a sought-after second home location.\nTwo homes that both asked nearly $7 million, also on Marquette Drive and also listed by Roch, found buyers after only a few days on the market last month.\nOne of those homes, at 11561 Marquette Drive, went on the market Oct. 2 and went under contract with a buyer Oct. 5. The other, a home owned by former Illinois\nRepublican House Speaker Lee Daniels\n, went on the market Oct. 16 asking $7 million and went under contract Oct. 22.\nEarlier this year,\nMalort Maker Tremaine Atkinson\nfound a buyer for his 8,500-square-foot New Buffalo home listed at $6 million. And in the nearby town of Union Pier,\nDRW Holdings founder and CEO Don Wilson\noffloaded his lakeshore home for $7 million in March.\nThe second home market near Chicago has been red-hot this year, with\nWisconsin\u2019s Lake Geneva\nseeing a string of $8 million-plus home sales this fall with its ceiling hitting $20 million, and luxury sales along the North Shore fetching record-breaking sale prices.\n",

        "content": "A puzzling redevelopment site in one of Chicago\u2019s western suburbs is back in play, and this time the pitch is far simpler.\nD.R. Horton floated a plan to turn the former Northern Baptist Theological Seminary campus in\nLombard\nnear Yorktown Center into a 159-unit townhouse community, putting a strictly residential concept on a property that has defied more ambitious visions for nearly a decade, the Daily Herald\nreported\n.\nThe seminary decamped for Lisle in 2017, leaving behind a 27-acre parcel east of the mall. Initial redevelopment concepts \u2014 anchored by a golf driving range, a Moretti\u2019s restaurant and an apartment component \u2014 never advanced beyond planning.\nNow\nD.R. Horton\n, which built the Summit at Yorktown townhomes along the mall\u2019s ring road, is looking to send its trajectory west.\nEarly reactions from\nLombard\u2019s\nplan commission suggest the more modest proposal may finally fit the site\u2019s realities.\nThe parcel is oddly shaped, constrained by wetlands and a large detention pond along its southern edge. Most of the buildable land is tucked away from major thoroughfares like Butterfield Road and 22nd Street, limiting commercial potential. Several commissioners said a residential focus makes sense given those limitations and the momentum of nearby multifamily development.\nThe previous master plan would have added convenience retail, a gas station and up to 400 apartments. None materialized. Campus structures have since been demolished, and the village has acquired a sliver of the land for a new water tower, now moving into construction. Everything else remains untouched.\nD.R. Horton\u2019s\nconcept is still early and would require rezoning and an amendment to Lombard\u2019s comprehensive plan. Village staff and the plan commission have given informal feedback, but no application has been submitted. If the deal moves ahead, the builder would be required to provide preliminary engineering and architectural plans.\nThe project is an extension of a broader strategy by Horton to deepen its presence in Chicago\u2019s western suburbs. Cole Tyrell, the company\u2019s regional vice president, said in a statement that the company has been aware of the site for a couple years now, and while the plan is intended as for-sale housing, D.R. Horton wants to maintain flexibility as the entitlement process unfolds and market conditions shift.\nThe Texas-based builder, the largest in the country, hopes to secure approvals and start construction in late 2026 and begin sales in 2027.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

That project would turn a recently closed\nSafeway store in the Fillmore District at 1335 Webster Street\ninto 1,800 apartments. The real estate firm has a deal to buy the property from Safeway.\nThe Bernal Heights proposal could run into opposition from neighborhood residents. Two\naffordable housing projects\nnear the Safeway site are under development but faced pushback from neighbors along the way.\nAlign can skirt the 40-foot height limit for a building that rises 75 feet and skip over a lengthy local public review process by setting aside a portion of the units as affordable housing.\nOf the 370 proposed units, 51 would be set aside as income-restricted for low-income and very-low-income households. The plan would add more than seven times as many affordable homes as have been built in Bernal Heights over the past two decades.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "HKS is trading its downtown Houston address for a taller one.\nThe Dallas-based architecture heavyweight, known locally for its work on Baylor St. Luke\u2019s O\u2019Quinn Medical Tower and an\nNRG Park\ndesign study, signed a lease for 11,200 square feet at JPMorgan Chase Tower, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe deal shifts\nHKS\nfrom the Jones on Main complex, at 712 Main Street, into 600 Travis Street, the 75-story flagship owned by Hines, the Houston developer with a long history of reinvesting in its skyline-defining properties.\nCresa\u2019s Christopher Schafer and Dustin Cruz represented\nHKS\n, while\nHines\ntapped a Partners Real Estate team of Michael Anderson, Brad Beasley and Diana Bridger \u2014 part of the high-profile brokerage practice now led by Chip Colvill \u2014 to secure the tenant.\nA $25 million renovation in 2021 repositioned the 1980s tower as a more contemporary workplace.\nThe project revamped the first- and second-floor lobbies, enhanced tunnel access and modernized the exterior plaza. A new conference center spans two floors and can host up to 150 people, while the former 60th-floor Sky Lobby has been reimagined as a tenants-only \u201cSky Lounge.\u201d\nThe aesthetic centerpiece is a glass pyramid entry inspired by the Louvre \u2014 a subtle nod to I.M. Pei &amp; Partners, which designed the tower. Restaurant tenants and outdoor seating areas aimed at creating pedestrian engagement have also helped the building stand out in a downtown still battling post-pandemic foot traffic challenges. The refresh has been key to Hines retaining existing tenants and winning new ones, Beasley said.\nHKS is active in Houston\u2019s civic and institutional planning. Earlier this year, it was among several architecture groups that submitted concepts for a potential overhaul of\nNRG Park\n. HKS\u2019 contributions centered on layouts for NRG Arena, though broader master planning is in progress, and no redesigns have been approved.\nBeasley\u2019s team has stayed busy elsewhere, recently brokering a 4,000-square-foot lease for Trammell P.C. at San Felipe Place in River Oaks. The deal brought the boutique Class A building to more than 95 percent leased, a notable benchmark in a market where newer trophy-level space is scarce. JLL\u2019s Anya Marmuscak, who represented the law firm, said the group prioritized newer construction and room to grow.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The six-bedroom, 10-bathroom home sits on a 0.8-acre lot.

        "content": "As we near the end of Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 first and final term, several projects, rezonings and other real estate-related issues will stretch into the next administration.\nThat includes, of course, the Elizabeth Street Garden drama. The site\u2019s selected developers\nfiled a lawsuit\nWednesday, alleging that the administration unlawfully designated the property city parkland. The complaint alleges that such a change needs to go through the city\u2019s land-use review process.\nSo, this issue will continue to play out in court and then in the next administration.\nThe trajectory of another approved project may also depend on the new mayor. In July, the City Council\napproved\nOne45, a three-building project with 1,000 units, of which 338 will be permanently affordable. Before approval, developer Bruce Teitelbaum signed an agreement with Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, pledging to negotiate with city officials and nonprofits to possibly increase the number of affordable units. Such a move would require public subsidy, which has not materialized.\nOn Thursday, the New York Interfaith Commission on Housing Equality\u2019s Defend Harlem campaign is hosting a rally near the development site, at 145th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard, to call on the city and state to provide public subsidy to increase affordable housing on the site. Kai Cogsville, a representative for Defend Harlem, said he wants to see units affordable to those earning between $34,000 and $65,0000 a year, or roughly between 30 and 60 percent of the area median income.\n\u201cThose are the people who have been excluded the most,\u201d he said.\nTeitelbaum said in a statement that he is \u201cnot unmindful\u201d of the concerns raised by Defend Harlem, but\nadded, \u201cwe cannot do it alone.\u201d\n\u201cWe are on record in support of building as much genuinely affordable housing as possible, but that requires the cooperation of City Hall,\u201d he said.\nHe said he\u2019s spoken to current administration officials several times to no avail.\n\u201cIt is a conversation we are willing to have with the Mayor-elect, but time is of the essence,\u201d he said.\nOf course, the city has other projects in its pipeline. During fiscal year 2025, the city financed the creation or preservation of 28,281 units of affordable housing, which is 11 percent more than the previous year. Of that, 13,361 were new and 14,920 were preservation units.\nUnfortunately, there isn\u2019t a public database where I can see what projects are in that pipeline and where exactly they stand. But many of those projects will likely also stretch into the next administration.\nKeep an eye out for more coverage of issues and projects that may be taken up by the next mayor.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nCity Hall says it has the authority to declare city-owned land a park without going through Ulurp to map a use change. Does it? Send a note (and examples) to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nICYMI, the Department of Buildings on Tuesday unveiled six new sidewalk shed designs \u2014 three by Practice for Architecture and Urbanism and three by Arup. Contractors will be able to pull permits for these designs once DOB finishes the rulemaking process for applying the new shed types.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\nNYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch says she is ready to be part of the Mamdani administration\n,\nPolitico New York reports\n. The Mayor-elect said in October that he planned to ask Tisch to stay on as commissioner, and on Wednesday, she confirmed that she would accept the position.\n\u2014\nMohamed Bahi, former aide to Mayor Eric Adams, was sentenced to three years of probation Tuesday for arranging illegal straw donations to the mayor\u2019s campaigns,\nthe City reports\n. \u201cThere\u2019s a notable absence here of the person at the apex of the pyramid,\u201d Manhattan Federal Judge Dale Ho said, referring to Adams. (Ho dismissed the\nfederal charges\nagainst Adams at the behest of the Department of Justice but was critical of the request.)\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$5.5 million\nfor a 10,500-square-foot home at 3 Point Crescent in Whitestone. Helen Keit and Ross Keit with Keller Williams Realty Landmark\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was for\n$30 million\nfor 425 Seventh Avenue in Penn Plaza. United Pacific Development Corp sold the property to the Oved Group.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$25 million\nfor a 5,264-square-foot condominium unit at 201 East 74th Street in Lenox Hill. Barbara Russo, Christopher Salierno, Elena Sarkissian and MariaElena Scotto with Douglas Elliman have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 284,340-square-foot, 17-story, 300-unit project at 332 Beach 52nd Street in Far Rockaway. Ariel Aufgang filed the permit on behalf of Tishman Speyer.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "Infamous Manhattan landlord Steve Croman is dealing with more than 28 active foreclosure lawsuits targeting properties he controls. In total, lenders allege Croman\u2019s entities have defaulted on more than $231 million in loan principals.\nIt\u2019s just the latest legal challenge for Croman, one of the few New York landlords to see the inside of a prison cell.\nTwenty-one of the foreclosure suits were filed in the last week by lender Orange Owner LLC. The principal of those associated loans totals more than $189 million, according to a tally by\nThe Real Deal\n. Orange Owner LLC took over the notes after the collapse of New York Community Bank, where Croman had originally gone for financing.\nBut Orange Owner isn\u2019t the only lender seeking payback from Croman. Delaware Trust Company, acting as a trustee for another lender, has\nfiled seven suits\nagainst Croman\u2019s entities, going back to this summer. Principal on those loans totals $42.4 million.\nDelaware Trust accused Croman of failing to pay insurance and water bills for those properties. In a court filing, Croman denied many of the allegations. However, neither he nor lawyers representing him at Goldberg Weprin Finkel Goldstein LLP immediately responded to a request for comment.\nThe properties facing foreclosure span much of Manhattan, from Nolita and Chinatown to Yorkville and the Upper East Side.\nCroman, once\ndubbed\none of the city\u2019s worst multifamily landlords, is perhaps used to the hot seat. After years of accusations that he defrauded and harassed tenants, Croman entered a settlement with the New York attorney general\u2019s office in 2017 to pay $8 million in tenant restitution and hand over management of his properties for five years. That same year, he completed an eight-month prison stint for mortgage and tax fraud.\nSeparately, Croman was\nsued this summer by his father\n, Edward. The elder Croman is hoping to dissolve 63 limited companies he is part of with his son, alleging that he hasn\u2019t received disbursements, loans haven\u2019t been repaid and the deterioration of his relationship with Steve has made running the companies impractical.\nThe past weeks\u2019 foreclosures were previously reported by\nCrain\u2019s\nand the\nNew York Post\n, but the number of suits has since increased.\nKelly Schneid of Moritt Hock &amp; Hamroff, representing Orange Owner LLC in the suits, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Christopher Gorman of Rosenberg &amp; Estis, representing Delaware Trust Company, declined to comment.\n",

        "content": "Zillow is pointing out the racial makeup of neighborhoods for homes sold without being publicly listed in its latest attack on Chicago\u2019s MLS over its\nPrivate Listing Network\n.\nChicago-area homes in majority white neighborhoods are more than twice as likely to be listed on the private platform compared to homes in majority non-white areas, Zillow highlighted in an analysis published Thursday morning.\nZillow claims exclusive marketing practices like the Private Listing Network threaten fair housing standards and reinforce segregated neighborhoods. Chicago\u2019s MLS operator, Midwest Real Estate Data (MRED), created the network in 2016 as a listing option for Chicago-area brokers that displays offerings to all other agents subscribed to MRED, but keeps them off public platforms like Zillow.\n\u201cThe data show clear disparities, and good intentions are no longer an excuse for expanding digital redlining,\u201d Zillow Senior Economist Orphe Divounguy said.\nThe critique comes as Zillow this year rolled out\nListing Access Standards\nthat require listings to be made available on public portals within one business day of being publicly marketed. The rules, largely a reaction to office-exclusive listings like the marketing strategy\nchampioned by Compass\n, would also limit how Chicago-area brokers can use the Private Listing Network.\nChicago is one of the few markets where Zillow hasn\u2019t begun enforcing the standards, but under the rules, listings that start on the private network and then move to the standard MLS would be blocked from showing up on Zillow after their transitions.\nAccording to Zillow, it examined more than 40,000 listings available on Chicago\u2019s MLS on Oct. 21, controlling for factors like price, home type, location and broker activity. The study found that 7.9 percent of homes in majority-white neighborhoods were on the Private Listing Network, compared to 3.4 percent in majority-non-white neighborhoods.\nThe data is a \u201ccautionary example as some large brokerages are pushing to expand private marketing of homes nationwide \u2014 a trend poised to amplify inequity if it spreads,\u201d Zillow said.\nIn a March essay detailing the Private Listing Network, MRED acknowledged the fair housing concerns that private listings present. It argued the MLS-wide platform, which shows listings to all brokers in the MLS, limits those concerns by spreading beyond a single agent or brokerage\u2019s network.\n\u201cRequiring listings to be visible to all MLS subscribers helps ensure transparency, broad access, and reduces the risk of discriminatory steering, whether intentional or inadvertent,\u201d the MRED paper said.\nMRED has\ndug in on defending\nits private network, suggesting Zillow\u2019s standards are a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d policy that ignores sensitive life events \u2014 like divorce, death or illness \u2014 that could cause a homeowner to want more privacy in listings.\nPractically, the Private Listing Network is used often by sellers who want to test their home price and limit the number of days on the market before going public.\nZillow has bashed the Private Listing Network and reached out to managing brokers warning that offerings that use the system would violate its standards, but it has not said when it will start enforcing its rules. MRED previously said blocking certain listings may be a violation of its agreement with Zillow that allows the site to display MRED offerings.\nMRED also published its own data in the March essay, highlighting stats it said prove the benefits of the private network. According to the paper, the average private listing closed for 90.7 percent of its list price compared to 86.9 percent for public offerings in 2024. Private listings also spent less time on the market on average, at 29 days in 2024, compared to 44 days for public listings.\nZillow\u2019s data, though, reinforces the home search giant\u2019s argument that private listings distort the housing market and lead to unequal access for consumers. The company pointed to 2018 research that found pocket listings can unintentionally contribute to segregation, by limiting private listings to an agent\u2019s network. White agents are more likely to work with white clients, the study said, while Black and Latino agents are more likely to work with non-white clients.\nThe spat over the Private Listing Network \u2014 a feature that among MLSes at large is relatively unique to MRED \u2014 is playing out as a\ntrial is underway\nin the lawsuit Compass brought against Zillow over its listing rules. Compass has alleged Zillow is unfairly leveraging monopoly power to stifle competition.\n",

        "content": "Another downtown Chicago\napartment tower\nis up for grabs, adding to a growing list of landlords looking to cash in on a rental market that keeps defying gravity.\nTexas-based 3L Real Estate hired JLL to market Astoria Tower, a 30-story, 248-unit property at 8 East 9th Street in the\nSouth Loop\n, according to a marketing flyer, first\nreported\nby Crain\u2019s.\nThe timing isn\u2019t subtle. Downtown Chicago\nrents jumped\nmore than 8 percent year over year in the third quarter, the biggest annual increase in three years, according to Integra Realty Resources.\nWith little new construction in the pipeline and\ndemand holding firm\n, the supply squeeze is pushing rents higher and coaxing owners to the sales market after several years defined by interest-rate volatility.\n3L\nacquired Astoria Tower in 2022 for $82.5 million, or roughly $333,000 a unit, per CoStar. The building\u2019s backstory mirrors the arc of the last condo cycle: originally delivered as for-sale units in 2009, the tower struggled during the post-crash downturn.\nCrescent Heights\nscooped up 205 condos in 2010, operated them as rentals and began buying out remaining owners in 2019 to execute a full condo deconversion into rental units.\nToday Astoria Tower is 97 percent occupied, JLL\u2019s materials show. Brokers David Gaines and Bill Baumann are positioning the property as having value-added potential \u2014 the kind of asset investors often chase when rent growth is strong but new inventory is limited. The pitch: refresh the units, modernize amenities and capture even higher rents in a neighborhood where renter demand is resilient.\nThe building offers studios through three-bedrooms with monthly rents ranging from $1,832 to $4,600.\n3L didn\u2019t comment on the listing, but the firm has been an active player in Chicago\u2019s middle-market multifamily sector. Its local holdings include the converted former\nEbony and Jet\nmagazine building at 820 South Michigan Avenue and other South Loop and Hyde Park properties. Across its portfolio, 3L said it controls more than 1,700 units, with another 1,000-plus in development.\nAstoria\u2019s appearance on the market underscores a broader shift: after years of stalled transaction volume, more downtown owners see an opening. With fundamentals this tight and pricing momentum back, investor interest \u2014 at least for well-located, cash-flowing buildings \u2014 may have room to climb.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The announcement is the latest sign the company isn\u2019t rushing to shutter the landmark.\nSaks\n, which acquired\nNeiman Marcus Group\nlate last year in a $2.7 billion deal, said in a statement that it is \u201ccommitting to serving its loyal customer base in Dallas\u201d while planning unfolds into next year.\nThat reassurance follows a whiplash-inducing end to last year, when Saks targeted a January closure before bumping the date to March.\nThe prospect of losing a pillar of Dallas retail \u2014 the store opened in 1907 and helped cement the city\u2019s fashion credentials \u2014 triggered a civic pushback rare for the department-store sector. City officials, business leaders and even developers stepped in, arguing that the flagship is essential to Main Street\u2019s identity and\ndowntown\u2019s momentum\n.\nThose efforts paid off. Dallas City Manager Kim Tolbert said the city \u201ccelebrates\u201d the extension and will continue working with Saks Global Executive Chairman Richard Baker on a long-term path to keep Neiman\u2019s downtown. Tolbert noted the store\u2019s role in elevating Dallas as a global retail destination and said its presence remains woven into the neighborhood\u2019s cultural fabric.\nStill, questions linger about what to do with the real estate. At more than 100,000 square feet and nine floors, the building offers flexibility.\nConcepts floated in recent years include an events venue and a fashion museum honoring Neiman\u2019s legacy.\nMeanwhile, Saks is planning roughly $100 million in renovations at the Neiman\u2019s store in NorthPark Center, underscoring a broader reinvestment strategy even as the future of downtown\u2019s location is unresolved.\nThe timing adds a layer of urgency.\nDallas\nis preparing for the 2026 FIFA\nWorld Cup\nand reassessing aging real estate across downtown.

        "content": "The classic example of old, energy-wasting buildings in New York is residents opening their windows in winter to let the heat out. Landlords must set the thermostat high enough to keep the coldest apartment warm, which makes the warmest units hot.\nSome folks call this the \u201clowest common denominator problem.\u201d\nMany newer apartment buildings, however, have a different energy-wasting issue that\u2019s not so obvious: Their HVAC systems are running all the time, even when they are not needed.\nThese systems have various features that prevent units from getting too hot or too cold, so nobody\u2019s opening windows. But energy is being wasted nonetheless \u2014 behind the walls and out of sight.\nStartup founder Brad Pilgrim offered an analogy:\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you drink coffee once or twice a day. What if the coffeemaker runs 24-7-365? That\u2019s kind of how a building runs.\u201d\nPilgrim launched a Toronto company called Parity in 2017 to fix this problem. Then he looked for cities with cold winters and hot summers, high energy costs and many of the buildings in which Parity\u2019s product would work best.\nNew York, with its pricey utility rates and bounty of high-rise rentals, co-ops, condos and hotels, was the motherlode. The city added a third factor when it passed Local Law 97, creating an emissions cap for large buildings. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like a triple threat,\u201d Pilgrim said.\nToday, Parity does more than half of its business in New York. It also operates in Boston, New Jersey, California, Toronto and the Washington, D.C., metro area.\nThe company targets mid-rise multifamily to high-rise luxury buildings of roughly 75,000 square feet where the equipment is not working together to efficiently control the temperature. Its platform reads what that equipment is doing and then constantly sends back new operating instructions to reduce (or increase) production to meet demand.\nEssentially, it aims to ensure the HVAC system\nuses as little power as possible\nto maintain comfort. If a piece of equipment cannot be controlled by Parity\u2019s platform, the company finds something off-the-shelf to make that happen, rather than sell buildings a custom product.\n\u201cOur typical customers see a payback of 2 to 2.5 years,\u201d Pilgrim claimed, pointing to case studies on Parity\u2019s website. The company charges a fee for installation and for monthly service.\nTo reassure skeptical building owners, it guarantees energy savings and cuts them a check if it falls short. But even that is not enough to convince some of them.\nI asked Pilgrim why.\n\u201cEnergy is invisible, it\u2019s not tangible. It\u2019s not like a lobby retrofit,\u201d he said. \u201cHVAC optimization and energy management is complicated, and you don\u2019t see it. So it\u2019s more difficult for someone to tie value to it.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cReal estate tends to be a very pragmatist vertical,\u201d where people invest in the familiar. To some, his product \u2014 which only became possible with the advent of cloud computing \u2014 \u201csounds too good to be true.\u201d\nVenture capitalists have bet on Parity, which\nraised $19 million\nlast year in a Series B funding round led by Idealist Capital. It has fewer than 50 employees and a customer portfolio of nearly 100 million square feet.\nExtreme weather is not the company\u2019s sweet spot, because it doesn\u2019t deliver savings when an HVAC system is firing on all cylinders, such as during a heat wave. However, it does pre-condition buildings in anticipation of peak consumption hours, to reduce a building\u2019s consumption when the grid is stretched to its limit.\nLast June, when a blackout was narrowly avoided, Parity helped about 30 buildings reduce their electricity consumption by about 1 megawatt as part of a \u201cdemand response\u201d program, Pilgrim said, adding that Parity is not a\ndemand response aggregator\n. It can also tailor usage to reduce consumption when rates are highest.\nMany proptech firms, consultants and contractors are marketing ways for buildings to reduce their power use. Their selling point is to save property owners money, but effective products and projects also help the state meet its\nclimate goals\nand, perhaps more urgently, reduce demand on a grid that is getting closer to being unreliable during peak-use periods.\nIn fact, the New York Independent Systems Operator recently warned that the city\u2019s grid might not be reliable\nas soon as next year\n. \u201cStrain on the grid,\u201d Pilgrim said, \u201cis becoming a real problem.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The Upper East Side townhouse at 7 East 81st Street, owned by Sotheby\u2019s chief executive officer Charles Stewart and his wife Caterina, was described by\nArchitectural Digest\nas \u201celegantly eclectic\u201d in November 2023.\nThese days, their next-door neighbors might call it something else.\nA lawsuit filed by a trust apparently representing Jill Davis, a long-time comedy writer and author, and Edward Conrad, a former Bain Capital managing partner, who live at 5 East 81st Street, claims the pair has been unlawfully renovating their home for over four years.\nA complaint filed on Wednesday outlines grievances with the construction and accuses the Stewarts of doing work \u201cwith an utter disregard for the safety of [Davis and Conrad\u2019s] home, and in a manner repugnant to all reasonable standards of professional conduct and communal civility.\u201d\nCharles declined a request for comment through a spokesperson for Sotheby\u2019s.\nThe Stewarts tore off the rear facade of their home and undertook excavation and ground-up development that led to a construction beam shattering the roof of a glass atrium at Davis and Conrad\u2019s home, according to the complaint.\nDavis and Conrad\u2019s home allegedly suffered water damage from alterations made to the shared wall between the townhouses and an improperly installed sidewalk shed in the front of the properties.\nThe neighbors have allegedly tried to negotiate an access agreement for years, which is generally required for construction being done that will encroach on neighboring properties. But Davis and Conrad claim they entered into a limited agreement with a fictional entity, CAHS Construction, which the complaint says was created by the Stewarts to protect themselves legally.\nThe conditions of that agreement were not followed, according to the complaint, and subsequent attempts to negotiate additional terms were used as \u201ca front to buy them time\u201d without needing to pay license or professional fees.\nThe Stewarts currently have a partial stop-work order from the Department of Buildings and 10 open violations on their property, according to public records. The partial stop-work order states that supported pipe scaffolding was installed \u201ccontrary to approved plans\u201d with \u201cmultiple make-shift components\u201d that have created \u201chazardous and unsafe\u201d conditions for the property at 5 East 81st Street.\nConard and Davis are seeking monetary damages and an injunction on the work.\nStewart bought the home, which had previously served as a rental building, in November 2019 for $9.9 million, one month after taking over as Sotheby\u2019s CEO.\n",

        "content": "The Boca Raton City Council unanimously approved plans by the city\u2019s housing authority and Miami-based Atlantic Pacific Companies to add 105 apartments to a decades-old affordable housing complex.\nThe zoning changes will enable Atlantic Pacific and the Boca Raton Housing Authority to build two new three-story apartment buildings with 54 one-bedroom units, 42 two-bedroom units and nine three-bedroom units in the southern portion of the Residences at Martin Manor, a 10-acre affordable apartment community at 1350 North Dixie Highway.\nOriginally known as Dixie Manor, what was once a 95-unit complex will be redeveloped by Atlantic Pacific into a modern complex with a total of 200 apartments. As part of its transformation, most of the original buildings are being demolished.\n\u201cDixie Manor was developed many moons ago, between the 1940s and 1980s, and [the buildings] were in disrepair,\u201d Ele Zachariades, Atlantic Pacific\u2019s lobbyist, told the council at its meeting on Tuesday.\nBut one 1940s-era, 4,650-square-foot building will be preserved with half the space transformed into a museum for Pearl City, a once segregated neighborhood for African Americans that was founded in 1915 and predated the existence of Boca Raton.\nAtlantic Pacific, led by CEO Howard Cohen, and the Housing Authority opted to expand the number of units due to the large waiting list for affordable apartments in Boca Raton, Zachariades added.\nThe new apartments built on site will be reserved for households earning between 30 percent and 80 percent of area median income, said Ashley Whidby, executive director of the Boca Raton Housing Authority. As of 2025, for a one-person household, 30 percent of Palm Beach County\u2019s AMI is $24,570, while 80 percent of AMI is $65,520, according to the Florida Housing Finance Corporation.\nA real estate development and management company, Atlantic Pacific Communities won a bid to redevelop Dixie Manor in 2024.\nAtlantic Pacific is also planning other affordable housing projects in South Florida, including\na 600-unit affordable apartment complex\nnear St. Martin de Porres Catholic Church in Leisure City; a\n71-unit affordable housing\nbuilding near the shuttered Carver Theater in Liberty City; and an eight-story\naffordable and workforce housing project with 375 apartments\nin Miami\u2019s Overtown. Atlantic Pacific and Casa Familia will also\ncollaborate to build 124 apartments for disabled adults in Kendall\n.Among other projects in Boca Raton planned to include affordable housing, 900 Broken Sound Acquisition, LLC and an affiliate of Atlanta-based Peachtree Group won approval in June to develop\na 289-unit, mixed-unit apartment building\nat 900 Northwest Broken Sound Parkway that will include 44 workforce and affordable housing units. And investment firm Oak Lane Partners plans a\n243-unit Live Local Act apartment project\nnear its office building at 791 Park of Commerce Boulevard that will include 38 affordable and workforce apartments and townhouses.",
