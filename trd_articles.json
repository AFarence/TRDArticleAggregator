        "content": "A small\nMarin County\npost office is at the center of a back-and-forth over housing, but a new development proposal looks to keep the building in the same place.\nPaul Thompson, founder and president of Novato-based\nThompson Builders\n, bought the 34,720-square-foot lot at 15 Calle Del Mar in Stinson Beach for an undisclosed price and filed a preliminary application to build six residences at the site, the Marin Independent Journal\nreported\n.\nThe property is currently home to a 9,000-square-foot parking lot and a 3,392-square-foot commercial building, which houses the Stinson Beach post office, a catering company and a cleaning company. Thompson is looking to demolish the building and replace it with a mixed-use residential and commercial building on one corner of the property and four two-story detached condominiums in another. The post office would move to a new 1,250-square-foot space on the ground floor of the mixed-use building.\nThe four proposed condos would be sold at market-rate prices and range in size from about 1,700 square feet to 2,200 square feet with two- and three-bedroom floorplans. Another two residences would each span about 775 square feet on the second floor of the commercial building for a total of six units on site.\nMarin County might be known as a\nNIMBY stronghold\n, but officials are \u201chappy to see an increase to the housing supply\u201d at the site, Sarah Jones, director of the Marin County Community Development Agency, said.\nThompson\u2019s team is preparing to lean on California\u2019s density bonus law, not in order to build more units than zoning would allow, but to secure setback waivers tied to the surrounding wetlands and Eskoot Creek. Because the parcel sits in a coastal zone, the development would need a coastal permit and sign-off that it complies with Marin\u2019s local coastal program. That includes meeting creek and riparian setbacks that can exceed 100 feet. Septic will be another hurdle, as\nStinson Beach\nisn\u2019t under county authority for wastewater, and its water district requires a 100-foot buffer from waterways unless a variance is granted.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A lender is aiming to deliver a knockout blow against boxing promoter Don King over a distressed 52-acre redevelopment site in Palm Beach County.\nA foreclosure auction for the former jai alai fronton at 1415 45th Street in Mangonia Park is set for May 18 after Palm Beach County Circuit Court Judge Scott Kerner last month awarded a $42.5 million judgment in favor of an affiliate of\nTaylor Made Lending\n, a Pompano Beach-based hard money lender, court records show.\nKing\nand Taylor Made Lending\u2019s attorneys did not respond to requests for comment.\nTwo entities managed by King that own the property listed the site for sale in April without an asking price, but sources said the boxing legend was seeking offers in the\n$100 million\nrange.\nThe same month, Taylor Made Lending sued the entities for allegedly defaulting on three loans totaling\n$38 million\nthat were obtained between 2023 and last year. Taylor Made is the special servicer, representing a consortium of investors that own the mortgages, including Miami-based Winston Capital Management.\nThe lawsuit alleges King is a personal guarantor of the loans, but he is not named as a defendant in the complaint. King has a pending motion to dismiss the foreclosure case.\nThe property includes a shuttered 282,800-square-foot jai alai fronton built in 1973, and a lot that is used for parking for a neighboring Tri-Rail passenger rail station, according to an online offering memorandum. King, who\norganized\nsome of boxing\u2019s greatest all-time matches, bought the site for $6.3 million in 1999, records show.\nKing took out the first loan for $22.3 million at a 13.9 percent annual interest rate in 2023, court records show. A year later, he took out the second loan for $9 million at an 18.5 percent annual interest rate, and the third loan for $800,000 with a 2 percent annual interest rate, according to the two mortgages, which were attached to the foreclosure complaint.\nTaylor Made alleges King stopped making the monthly $138,750 interest-only payments on the $9 million loan in September and failed to repay the $800,000 loan when it matured in December.\nKing last attempted to sell the Mangonia Park site a decade ago, but a deal with West Palm Beach-based FRI Investors fell apart.\nThe property is approved for primarily office, governmental, medical outpatient, educational and manufacturing uses, but 25 percent of the site could be developed into some retail such as pharmacies, gift shops, restaurants and gyms, the offering states.\u00a0In July, King sold another distressed property facing foreclosure. An affiliate of Straticon, a Boca Raton-based construction firm, paid\n$11 million\nfor King\u2019s warehouse in Deerfield Beach that served as the boxing promoter\u2019s headquarters. Proceeds from the sale satisfied an allegedly delinquent $5.1 million mortgage King took out on the property in 2023.",

Of that, $5 million would be pulled from special taxes paid by homeowners in the area. The columbarium proposal arose after veterans failed to get their wish for a service member cemetery in Irvine and took their plans to Anaheim for state backing.\nCity officials are looking to build a transit-oriented development that would link the Great Park and Irvine Spectrum neighborhoods at the Crescent site.\n\u201cThe area is particularly well-suited for higher-density residential and mixed-use formats, sidewalk-activated retail and creative commercial spaces, walkable urban blocks and a lifestyle environment attractive to young professionals and knowledge-sector employees,\u201d according to a city staff report cited by LAist.\nThe City of Irvine is required by the state to plan for 23,610 new residential units by 2029 as part of its\nhousing element\n. Affordable housing must make up 14,939 of those units.\nGreat Park Neighborhoods spans 2,100 acres and opened its first community in 2013. Since then, it\u2019s become one of the country\u2019s top-selling master-planned projects, with builders reporting more than 7,000 home sales, the Orange County Business Journal\nreported\n. FivePoint has already\nsold more than 9,000 lots\nin Great Park, averaging about $790,000 each.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Z&amp;L previously secured approval from the city of San Jose to\nbuild a 708-unit residential high-rise\n. Prior to the\nforeclosure seizure\n, Z&amp;L sought to stave off losing the property through various legal proceedings, including a bankruptcy filing.\nThe $23 million financing package is below what would typically be required to pay for construction of a major residential development such as the one plotted by Z&amp;L. Still, Xu, who signed the mortgage, is seemingly well-positioned to bring in more financing from other insurance companies, judging by the size of the financing deal, according to the Mercury News. Plans for the site are unclear.\nThe United Construction &amp; Development Group founder has developed several large projects in the New York City area, including\nSkyline Tower\n, the second-tallest skyscraper in Queens, as well as other residential towers in the city.\nThe site\u2019s new owners indicated in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court filing during proceedings with Z&amp;L that they were prepared to build a large residential project on the bus station site.\n\u201cThe vacant land at issue is a rotting, empty former Greyhound station,\u201d the owner group said. \u201cIf allowed to proceed [with a foreclosure], [we have] the resources to develop this piece of property as originally entitled.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The project, referred to as Sharka Data Center \u2013 Building 5, will include the core, shell, interior finishes and site improvements.\nConstruction is scheduled to begin in January and be completed by February 2027, though details remain preliminary.\nMidlothian Mayor Justin Coffman cited Google\u2019s local contributions to water conservation, job creation and economic growth. The Mountain View, California-based company first established a presence in Midlothian in 2019 through its Alamo Mission shell company, purchasing 375 acres in Ellis County, and later acquiring another 165 acres for future development, according to data center research firm Baxtel. In 2023, the company announced plans for another data center in the greater Dallas-Fort Worth metro market on 165 acres in nearby Red Oak.\nThe region south of Dallas has\ngained interest\nfrom data center builders because two major power lines run through it.\nCompass Datacenters\nand\nDataBank\nhave both invested in the market, and entrepreneur Ross Perot Jr.\nhas opined\nthat Texas is a good fit for data centers because they consume enormous amounts of energy.\nThe Midlothian expansion is part of Google\u2019s larger strategy in Texas. The company has pledged $40 billion in investments statewide through 2027, including projects in Midlothian, Red Oak and three additional data centers planned for West Texas and the Panhandle.\nThe surge in data center development reflects rising demand driven by artificial intelligence and cloud computing. Cushman &amp; Wakefield reported that in 2025, data centers and related industries accounted for 21 percent of new demand in warehouse and distribution properties in the Dallas-Fort Worth market.

Fort Worth-based Panther FW Investments was PHP\u2019s partner in the purchase. The sale price was not disclosed.\nGateway Business Center, at 6005 Commerce Drive, 6015 Commerce Drive, 6000 Campus Circle Drive and 6012 Campus Circle Drive, was constructed in 1981.

It focuses on acquisitions between $3 million and $30 million in Dallas-Fort Worth, San Antonio, El Paso, Houston and Austin.

All four purchases closed this year.\nDallas-Fort Worth\u2019s\nindustrial market\nremains strong, even though its vacancy rate ticked up in the third quarter. The region logged its 60th consecutive quarter of positive industrial space absorption, according to a recent report from CBRE.\nLess than 3 percent of third-quarter completions were pre-leased, which caused the vacancy rate to rise 20 basis points in the third quarter to 9 percent, CBRE found. But that figure is expected to drop again in the near future, since the percentage of pre-leased\nbuildings in the pipeline\nincreased from 18.4 percent to 40 percent by the end of the third quarter.\nManufacturing drove most of the quarter\u2019s leasing demand, according to CBRE.

        "content": "New York City\u2019s luxury market closed out 2025 on a high note\u00a0 \u2014 and with a more diverse slate of trophy trades than usual.\nTony Upper East Side co-ops, a Gilded Age townhouse and condos in Downtown Manhattan and on the Upper West Side topped this year\u2019s list of the 10 priciest deals in the Big Apple, alongside the Billionaires\u2019 Row supertalls that have spent recent years\ndominating the rankings\n.\nVornado Realty Trust\u2019s 220 Central Park South reclaimed the No. 1 spot after two deals over $100 million unseated the skyscraper in 2024. The addresses of those sales \u2014 Vlad Doronin\u2019s 730 Fifth Avenue and Gary Barnett\u2019s Central Park Tower \u2014 still landed among the priciest trades, even though no deals there, or anywhere else, cracked the nine-figure mark in 2025.\nTogether, the city\u2019s leading deals totaled $540 million, down significantly from more than $720 million last year.\nDespite the lower total, New York\u2019s luxury market hardly felt sluggish, as both deals and prices\nrose in the first quarter\n. Despite fears over the impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies began early in the year, the city\u2019s wealthiest buyers still kept the deals coming and were even undeterred by the November mayoral election, which some had warned could send rich New Yorkers in search of greener pastures.\nHere\u2019s a closer look at the deals that powered the city\u2019s luxury market in 2025:\n220 Central Park South | $83 million\nMedia magnate Byron Allen sold his 45th-floor condo at 220 Central Park South for\n$82.5 million\n, securing its No. 1 slot on the list in just the third month of the year. Allen, founder of Allen Media Group, bought the 6,000-square-foot condo for $75 million just two years earlier.\nCorcoran\u2019s Deborah Kern represented Allen in the off-market deal. A previous listing for the apartment described it as having five bedrooms, six bathrooms and two balconies.\n730 Fifth Avenue | $66 million\nThe second most expensive deal to close last year was the final condo at Vlad Doronin\u2019s Aman New York. Unit 25A traded for\n$66 million\nin January to a buyer whose identity is shielded by an LLC.\nThe final apartment at OKO Group\u2019s hotel-condo conversion spans 5,800 square feet and has four bedrooms and a terrace.\nThe Modlin Group\u2019s Adam Modlin represented the buyer, while the developer\u2019s in-house team led sales, which launched in 2018.\n150 Charles Street | $60 million\nComing in at No. 3 is the new record holder for the priciest condo deal ever in Downtown Manhattan. Financier Harsh Padia and his wife, interior designer Purvi Padia, sold their apartment at 150 Charles in March for a whopping\n$60 million\n\u2014 double what they paid for it in 2016.\nThe duplex, which sold to an anonymous buyer in an off-market deal, has five bedrooms, five bathrooms and a terrace overlooking the Hudson River.\nCompass\u2019 Jim St. Andr\u00e9 and Serhant\u2019s Peter Zaitzeff, whose new development dealmaking was featured on the new season of \u201cOwning Manhattan,\u201d represented the sellers. Compass\u2019 Eric Brown and Zeve Salman brought the buyer.\n960 Fifth Avenue | $54 million\nIn a list typically dominated by condos and townhouse sales, an apartment at one of Manhattan\u2019s esteemed co-ops managed to land in the top five priciest sales.\nThe 12th-floor unit at 960 Fifth Avenue sold in January for\n$53.5 million\n, a far cry from its 2023 listing price of $70 million. The co-op was sold by the estate of the late oil heiress Anne Hendricks Bass, who died in 2020, to a buyer whose identity is shielded by a trust.\nCompass\u2019 Alexa Lambert had the listing.\n217 West 57th Street | $47 million\nUnit 121 at Gary Barnett\u2019s Central Park Tower sold last month for\n$47.5 million\n, down from its last asking price of just under $55 million. The buyer\u2019s identity was hidden by an LLC known as The Locker Room 121.\nThe full-floor condo, which spans 7,000 square feet and has five bedrooms and five bathrooms, traded in an all-cash deal.\nAn in-house team with Extell Development is heading sales at the BIllionaires\u2019 Row tower alongside a team with Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, led by Kane Manera, Janet Wang, Gabriele Tonini and Tim Rizzo. Compass\u2019 Maurice Mizrahi brought the buyer.\n111 West 57th Street | $47 million\nThis year marked a turnaround for 111 West 57th Street, which was struggling to find buyers before JDS Development and Property Markets Group swapped sales teams. With Sotheby\u2019s International\u2019s Nikki Field Team at the helm, the developers offloaded penthouse No. 72 in April for just under $47 million.\nThe triplex condo traded for significantly less than the initial $66 million price listed in the developers\u2019 offering plan and came in under its\nlast ask of $56 million\n. But a deal is a deal, and the Billionaires\u2019 Row tower is now almost across the finish line with 95 percent of its units sold.\n50 West 66th Street | $47 million\nThe 47th-floor apartment at Extell Development\u2019s Lincoln Square project closed for $46.8 million in October, earning it the title of the most expensive sale on the Upper West Side this year. An anonymous buyer purchased the 6,900-square-foot condo, which features a terrace overlooking Central Park.\nThe developer\u2019s in-house team is heading sales at the 70-story tall project.\n973 Fifth Avenue | $46 million\nGoldman Sachs partner David Leuschen finally traded his Gilded Age mansion on the Upper East Side, though the final sale price was nowhere close to what he once sought for it in 2021.\nAn entity tied to the financier bought the 11-bedroom home at 973 Fifth Avenue in 2012 for $42 million. He listed the property almost a decade later for $80 million, though he didn\u2019t find a buyer until May, when he sold it for\n$46 million\nafter dropping the price under $50 million.\nCorcoran\u2019s Carrie Chiang, Andres Perea-Garzon and Lesley Schulhof had the listing. Modlin brought the buyer.\n217 West 57th Street | $46 million\nCentral Park Tower continued to log discount after discount in 2025, but this deal still managed to land among the year\u2019s 10 most expensive trades. The supertall\u2019s 116th floor sold for just under\n$46 million\n, down $7 million from its last asking price and $20 million from the price specified in the developer\u2019s offering plan.\nThe condo spans 7,100 square feet and has five bedrooms and five bathrooms. Extell Development\u2019s in-house team and a team with Corcoran Sunshine head sales at the building.\n740 Park Avenue | $45 million\nAnother co-op topped the priciest deals list this year, this one a sprawling Park Avenue pad sold by the late wife of billionaire David Koch, Julia Koch. Billionaire hedge funder Ken Griffin bought the 8,500-square-foot apartment in February for\n$45 million\n.\nKoch and her late husband bought the 18-room apartment in 2004 for $17 million. She started attempting to offload the unit, which was recently renovated, in 2022.\nCorcoran\u2019s Leighton Candler had the listing.\n",

        "content": "Manhattan rents are higher than ever as the year comes to a close.\nMedian rent in Manhattan reached $4,750 last month, according to the monthly report from Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel, which is based on new, brokered, market-rate leases. The boost spelled a 13 percent increase in prices year over year and the highest Manhattan rent ever recorded by the report.\nThe numbers bookend a banner year for Manhattan rents, which hit new all-time records five times in 2025. A combination of elevated mortgage rates, affluent new residents and tight supply has bolstered rents in the city\u2019s wealthiest borough, according to Jonathan Miller, the report\u2019s author.\n\u201cIt has all the makings of a tight market,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of deals to be had.\u201d\nManhattan median rents set their first record of the year in February, when they reached $4,500, and then kept climbing. Even though rents usually decline as both the temperature and demand cools, November came in $50 higher than the previous record, set in July ($4,700).\nThe higher end of the market has seen prices grow even faster than the borough-wide average. The median rent for the top 10 percent of apartments has grown more than 17 percent year over year, compared to the 13 percent city-wide growth rate.\nThat mirrors trends in the Manhattan sales market, Miller said, suggesting that instead of the same wealthy residents moving between renting and buying, the city is seeing an influx of affluent tenants. Meanwhile, Wall Street, responsible for more than 17 percent of the city\u2019s economy, continues to bring in record profits, according to a\nrecent report from the state comptroller\n. That puts money in the pockets of wealthier workers.\nBrooklyn and Northwest Queens have seen robust rent growth, but not to the same extent as Manhattan, consistent with the growing bifurcation of the market.\nMedian rent in Brooklyn came in at $3,804 while Northwest Queens fell just slightly to $3,510. Rent in Brooklyn has increased nearly 9 percent year over year, compared to just 1.5 percent in the Queens neighborhoods of Astoria, Long Island City, Woodside and Sunnyside.\nThe local trend runs in contrast to the national picture, where rents have been mostly flat or slipping.\nThe rent numbers are sourced from residential brokers and don\u2019t include unbrokered apartments, lease renewals, or rent-stabilized apartments.\n",

        "content": "With one week to go, the City Council is considering a number of bills feared by multifamily owners and developers.\nAs of this writing, a newly amended version of the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act is expected to drop Wednesday. Keep an eye out for our coverage on what that entails.\nA version of the measure\nreleased\nlast week gave nonprofits or private firms that team up with nonprofits first dibs on buying distressed multifamily properties with four or more units. Those changes did not win over the bill\u2019s critics.\nWednesday was the last day for bills to be finalized (the bills need to age before coming to a vote at the final City Council meeting of the year, Dec. 18).\nHousing groups have warned against four bills that would add new restrictions to city-funded housing, including setting a minimum for the percentage of two- to three- units built in these projects, capping the percentage of studio apartments in senior projects and requiring deeper affordability.\nI asked Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani about these bills during a press conference on Tuesday, but he didn\u2019t take a position. But the New York State Tenant Bloc, headed by Cea Weaver, who has advised Mamdani on housing policy, has come out against the bills.\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical that the incoming administration has the capacity to write a housing plan that can deliver on the affordability agenda that the Mayor-Elect ran on,\u201d said Ritti Singh, spokesperson for the Tenant Bloc. \u201cWhile these Council term-sheet bills are well-intentioned, they will limit Mamdani\u2019s ability to deliver on the agenda tenants across the city overwhelmingly voted for. In particular, they will slow down the development pipeline significantly and create new delays and new costs to produce the affordable housing New Yorkers desperately need.\u201d\nAnother measure would create a $40 per hour minimum wage and benefit rate for construction workers on projects that receive $1 million or more in city financing. The latest version of the bill excluded projects where 90 percent or more of the units are affordable to those earning at or below 60 percent of the area media income. The laborers\u2019 union, which has been pushing for the bill\u2019s passage, was not happy about the exclusions. I was told just before 5 p.m. that a new version will be released later Wednesday.\nLandlords have also been watching\na bill\nthat would require landlords to maintain a maximum indoor temperature in their buildings, either by providing central air or individual air conditioning units.\nWe\u2019ll keep you posted on where everything lands!\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat issues would you like to see\nTRD\ncover in the new year? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nA new report by HR&amp;A found that eliminating New York\u2019s Scaffold Law (which holds property owners liable when construction workers are injured in height-related falls) could result in savings that would support 8 to 10 percent more affordable housing units per project in NYC. The report was commissioned by the Building Trades Employers\u2019 Association, which has long been critical of the law. The report found that insurance costs in New York are two to five times higher than in other states.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Comptroller Brad Lander on Wednesday launched his campaign for New York\u2019s 10th Congressional District seat,\nthe New York Times reports\n. Lander is challenging incumbent Rep. Dan Goldman, with the support of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. Council member Alexa Avil\u00e9s, who was considering a run and secured the backing of the Democratic Socialists of America, also announced Wednesday that she will not throw her hat in the ring. She said she didn\u2019t want to split voters in challenging Goldman.\n\u2014 The New School is trying to close a $48 million budget gap by making steep staffing, faculty and program cuts,\nGothamist reports\n. The university has offered 40 percent, or 169, full-time faculty members voluntary separation or early retirement packages. Some view the cuts as an attack on the school\u2019s liberal arts divisions. \u201cIt does seem to be designed to minimize the power of the divisions that have historically been more politically motivated,\u201d Rachel Sherman, sociology professor at the New School\u2019s Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts, told the publication.\n\u2014 ICYMI, Kathryn Garcia is taking over for Rick Cotton at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey,\nPolitico New York reports\n. Garcia most recently served as Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s director of state operations.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$22.7 million\nfor a 3,409-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at Extell\u2019s 50 West 66th Street in Lincoln Square. Janice Chang and Timothy Hsu with Douglas Elliman\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$273 million\nfor a 629,323-square-foot office building at 147 East 44th Street in Grand Central. Rockwood Capital sold the 43-story property to Sovereign Partners.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$5.5 million\nfor a 3,920-square-foot multi-family at 120 East 10th Street in the East Village. Yoav Blat with Compass has the listing. The property last sold for\n$5 million\nin 2018.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 152,860-square-foot, eight-story school at 4261 Broadway in Hudson Heights. Matthew McChesney filed the permit on behalf of Lloyd Goldman of BLDG Management.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "As South Florida has become one of the most expensive places for dining out and for food and beverage tenants paying close to $100 a square foot for prime spaces, more local restaurants made an annual ranking of the 100 top grossing dining establishments in the country.\nFifteen South Florida restaurants are ranked in the 2025 Restaurant Business Top 100 Independents\nlist\n.\nMila, a pricey Mediterranean restaurant with a private members club in Miami Beach, claimed first place with $51.1 million in revenue this year, supplanting last year\u2019s No. 1 restaurant, Joe\u2019s Stone Crab, another South Florida dining institution. Mila occupies a 13,000-square-foot rooftop space at 1636 Meridian Avenue owned by David Edelstein\u2019s New York-based Tricap.\nThe restaurant, owned by\nGregory Galy\nand Marine Giron-Galy, ranked second last year with $49 million in revenue. Galy is a restaurant and hospitality developer.\nJoe\u2019s, which has been around for 110 years in the same spot in Miami Beach\u2019s\nSouth of Fifth\nneighborhood, dropped to third place in the latest Top 100 Independents list with $47.6 million in revenue. Last year, Joe\u2019s generated $49.4 million to claim the top spot. The restaurant is part of a two-story building owned by Stephen Sawitz, Joe\u2019s CEO.\nThe 13 other restaurants are ranked between 21 and 94 in the Top 100 Independents.\nFour more restaurants made the Top 100 Independents than last year, when 11 South Florida dining establishments were on the list. Still,\nSouth Florida\u2019s restaurant industry\nis going through some upheaval, Felix Bendersky with F+B Hospitality told\nThe Real Deal\n.\n\u201cIt was a tough year,\u201d Bendersky said. \u201cWe saw a lot of restaurants close. The biggest misconception [that restaurateurs] have is what it takes to hit those numbers, even for the best of the best. When a landlord says. \u2018I need a [tenant] that can do $30 million,\u2019 you can count the number of people who can do it with one hand.\u201d\nThe South Florida restaurants on the Top 100 Independents represent the top 1 percent of the tri-county region\u2019s dining scene, Bendersky added. \u201cMiami has become a place where there is no inbetween,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ones that made the list are all part of fantastic groups that are the best at what they do.\u201d\nOther restaurants that made this year\u2019s list include Komodo Miami at 26 with $23.1 million in revenue, Gekko Miami at 52 with $17.3 million in revenue and\nPapi Steak Miami\nat 64 with $15 million in revenue.\nDavid Grutman\u2019s\nMiami Beach-based Groot Hospitality owns the three venues. Although Komodo Miami tumbled from sixth place last year, and Papi Steak Miami fell from 27th place in 2024. Gekko Miami was not on last year\u2019s list.\nKomodo Miami occupies a ground-floor space in an office tower at\n801 Brickell Avenue\nowned by Miami-based Gatsby Enterprises. Papi Steak leases a space at 736 First Street in Miami Beach owned by Bernard Klepach, a North Miami business man who owns duty free shops at Miami International Airport. And Gekko Miami is in a ground-floor commercial unit of the SLS Lux Brickell condominium at Eight Southwest Eighth Street owned by a Delaware entity.\nDining out in Miami is more expensive than other U.S. metros such as Dallas, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, according to Chef\u2019s Pencil, which analyzed the cost of a mid-range three-course meal in a city and compared it to the average monthly net wage there.\nA mid-range three-course meal in Miami costs an average of $60. At Mila and Joe\u2019s Stone Crab, an average meal can cost $188 and $120, respectively, according to the Top 100 Independents list.",

        "content": "Dozens of Chicago homeowners attended a meeting hosted by Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi\u2019s office in West Garfield Park to learn why their property tax assessments skyrocketed.\nAmong them: Tonya Reed of Maywood, who saw her property tax bill more than double this year, rising from about $5,100 to $11,000. The county mailed almost 1.4 million tax bills on Nov. 14, with payment due Dec. 15, the\nChicago Sun Times reported\n.\nFor Reed, the tax increase pushed her monthly mortgage payment from $1,600 to $2,400, leaving her family struggling to balance household expenses. The hikes are concentrated in predominantly Black neighborhoods on Chicago\u2019s South and West sides, according to a Cook County treasurer\u2019s office report cited at the meeting.\nThe\nreport\nattributes the burden shift to reductions granted by the Board of Review to large commercial properties, including retail and data centers. As property values in the Loop have declined since the pandemic, residential values in lower-income neighborhoods have rebounded to pre\u2013Great Recession levels, accelerating tax increases. Other critics have pointed to the assessor\u2019s\nzero-sum tax system\n.\nOverall, Cook County\u2019s tax levy has risen, while businesses in the central district contribute less. The Board of Review recently reopened appeals for 24 townships, with a Friday deadline. Many attendees at the meeting came to seek exemptions and file appeals with the Board of Review.\nWest Garfield Park experienced the steepest increases, with median homeowner bills up nearly $2,000, or 133 percent. Longtime resident Dorothy Rosenthal questioned the accuracy of such assessments, noting her property suffered severe flooding in 2023 and remains partially unusable. Despite neighborhood improvements, she argued values could not have risen so dramatically.\nAt the meeting, residents voiced frustration that sympathy from officials does not offset the financial impact, according to the Sun Times. Kaegi has presented himself as an assessor tough on\ncommercial landlords\n, claiming that the decline in Downtown Chicago\noffice values\nwas exaggerated.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

Newport Beach, California-based Irvine Company has owned the property since 2010.\nThe Benesch deal follows a lease Irvine inked with Mayer Brown, an international law firm and the building\u2019s anchor tenant, which secured 272,000 square feet in an extension about a year ago.\nPrior to Benesch\u2019s expansion, the property was already 94 percent leased, according to data from CoStar Group, reflecting strong occupancy levels in a market where many office landlords face challenges. In the post-pandemic market, some law firms have been shrinking their space, while others are growing. For example, ArentFox Schiff recently vacated more than half of its space at\nWillis Tower\nwith a long-term lease extension. But earlier this year, Rope &amp; Gray expanded by 33 percent at a\nWacker Drive skyscraper\n.\nIrvine has positioned the tower at 71 South Wacker as a workplace designed with modern amenities and thoughtful layouts that foster collaboration, a good fit for\nlegal tenants\n.\nCleveland-based Benesch, which planted its flag in Chicago in 2015, is growing its space \u201cto keep pace with our sustained growth in attorney and staff headcount,\u201d managing partner Gregg Eisenberg said in a statement to Crain\u2019s. The firm originally moved into two floors at the 1.7 million-square-foot building, added a third floor during the pandemic, and now has a fourth floor. It had an attorney headcount of 145 in Chicago as of June, or 20 more than a year prior, according to Crain\u2019s data.\nCushman &amp; Wakefield brokers Ari Klein, Scott Shelbourne and Jeff Skender represented Benesch in the lease negotiations.

        "content": "When you think Gary Barnett, you think Billionaires\u2019 Row penthouses, not run-down rental buildings.\nBut Barnett\u2019s Fifth Avenue air rights deal offers a solution for rent-stabilized properties\nin crisis\n.\nBarnett\u2019s Extell Development is acquiring 135,000 square feet of air rights from the Metropolitan Club on Fifth Avenue for his mixed-use\nproject\nat 655 Madison Avenue \u2014 a deal made possible by the City of Yes.\nThe club\u2019s 790 Fifth Avenue is a landmark. Before City of Yes, it could sell air rights to a very limited number of properties next to it, but because the market was microscopic, a deal never happened. The club is only using 42 percent of its theoretical square footage, according to PropertyScout.\nThe City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, passed in 2023, allowed landmarks to\ntransfer air rights\nto sites farther away. Barnett\u2019s development site is a full avenue from the Metropolitan Club, but now it can acquire the club\u2019s rights.\nIf Extell uses the 135,000 extra square feet to build more apartments, it would mean homes for hundreds more people and millions of dollars of additional tax revenue. I think we can all agree those are good things.\nAnother plus: The Metropolitan Club will get money from the sale. Landmarks are expensive to maintain, and the sale proceeds will be used to fund continuing maintenance under a plan filed with the Landmarks Preservation Commission.\nGiven the extra costs that the commission imposes on buildings when it makes them landmarks, expanding their ability to sell air rights was the least the city could do.\nWhy not help rent-stabilized buildings in the same way?\nThey, too, have been burdened by the government: The state\nstrangled\ntheir revenues by\npassing the HSTPA\nin 2019. It also made the law permanent, removing landlords\u2019 leverage to negotiate changes. Demolition of these buildings is extremely difficult because tenants have a right to perpetual lease renewals.\nEven if an owner can buy out enough tenants to reach 80 or 100 percent vacancy, the state\u2019s Division of Homes and Community Renewal sometimes\nrefuses\npermission to substantially rehabilitate the building and remove it from rent regulation. HCR has become\nincreasingly stingy\nabout this.\nFor many owners, there is\nno escape\nfrom this\nfinancial vise\n. All they can do is buy time by deferring maintenance.\nMayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is looking for ways to help landlords keep up their rent-stabilized buildings\nwithout raising rents\n. Giving them the ability to sell air rights to a broad range of buyers is one way to do that \u2014 and would also allow developers to build more housing, which is also\ndesperately needed\n.\nNIMBY groups such as Village Preservation and people in Queens who voted for Andrew Cuomo would voice hysterical opposition to the prospect of more apartments, but Mamdani doesn\u2019t owe them anything.\nTenant groups, meanwhile, would likely support a measure that raises money from developers and ensures it can only be spent to upgrade rental buildings. YIMBY groups would welcome the creation of housing.\nDevelopers hate Mamdani\u2019s plan to raise taxes, but they willingly pay for air rights. And unlike a tax hike, the city could liberalize air rights transfers without a new state law.\nThe housing shortage is crushing New Yorkers, and rent-stabilized buildings are falling apart. Mamdani and Julie Menin, the next City Council speaker, could get their tenures off to a strong start by creating revenue literally out of thin air for two of the city\u2019s most pressing needs.\n",

The seller, Branford Med Properties, had previously intended to develop the land for doctors before the plan fell through.\nMajestic intends to break ground in early 2026 on a four-story office building spanning 45,000 square feet to 48,000 square feet. Construction is expected to take 12 to 18 months, with Majestic managing the $10 million-plus project entirely in-house, including design and construction.\nThe building will feature a distinctive design inspired by nearby offices and highlighted by a giant \u201cM.\u201d Planned amenities include a gym, full kitchen and bar for events.\nMajestic\u2019s current headquarters spans less than 10,000 square feet at 1650 Highway 6, about two miles away, with its lease expiring at the end of next year. The company currently employs 50 to 60 people, but aims to surpass 100 employees by the end of 2026, primarily expanding its engineering team. The growth stems from plans to break ground on eight projects next year, in addition to contracting to handle projects for other firms.\nFounded in 2021 by CEO Santosh Cividi, Majestic focuses on single-family development and smaller residential projects in the Houston metro market. It recently launched its first major project, Majestic at Harvest Green, a 12-acre commercial center within Johnson Development\u2019s\nHarvest Green\n\u201cagrihood,\u201d offering retail, restaurant, office and event space. While the company initially considered building its headquarters at Harvest Green, it decided to quickly secure the Sugar Land site once it became available.\nThe new site sits across I-69 from the Smart Financial Centre and near a planned 50-acre\nmixed-use development\nby Dhanani Private Equity Group, as well as Sugar Land\u2019s new Trader Joe\u2019s, which opened in October 2024.\nSugar Land, which\ncompetes with Houston\nfor office tenants, has landed some marquee corporate names, including\nFrazer\n, Sysco and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\nRe/Max represented Majestic in the purchase of the property. Partners Real Estate represented the seller.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

        "content": "The shrinking supply of unsold new development units caught up to the market in November.\nThere were 187 contracts signed at new development projects last month, down 22 percent from the same time last year, according to Marketproof\u2019s monthly\nreport\n. That drop mirrors the market segment\u2019s\nfall performance\n, which is down roughly 21 percent year-over-year since the start of September.\nContract activity for new development pales in comparison to the city\u2019s performance as a whole, which has\nsurged in the last few months\ndespite concerns over how the November election of\nZohran Mamdani might deter wealthy buyers\n. In November, overall contracts in Manhattan rose by over 20 percent from last year, according to\ndata\nfrom Miller Samuel.\nThe culprit? A\ncontracting pool of available new units\n. \u201cIt\u2019s tempting to blame muted purchase volume on the Mamdani election, but there\u2019s no evidence for that,\u201d Marketproof Kael Goodman said in a statement. \u201cThe simpler explanation is, inventory is low and new launches are scarce, so fewer buyers are finding what they want.\u201d\nIn the second quarter of this year, Manhattan\u2019s supply of new development condos reached a 10-year low at fewer than 3,600 unsold units, according to data previously shared with\nThe Real Deal\nby Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group.\nProject launches in Manhattan have been under the 10-year average for the last three years, but 2025 is shaping up to be the year when dwindling supply rears its head as buyers burn through the backlog of projects that built up around Covid.\nIn November, Manhattan saw 88 signed contracts, down from 125 last year. Nearly double the new units hit the market this fall compared to one year ago, but that rush followed few buildings coming to market during the spring \u2014 only 225 units, down from 511 last year, according to Marketproof.\nThe top-selling building in the borough has been Izaki Group\u2019s Village West project at 525 Sixth Avenue, which scored 16 contracts in November and has already put more than half of its 68 units in contract since launching sales in September.\nThe borough has seen a number of notable launches in the fall, including MRR Development\u2019s Malabar Residences at 126 East 57th Street, Related Companies\u2019 144-unit Upper East Side project called the Strathmore and the Flatiron Building\u2019s hotly-anticipated conversion into 38 ultra-luxury units. But none of them has yet contributed meaningfully to the contract tally.\nThe metrics also continue to suffer from 80 Clarkson, the largest launch of the year, not reporting any contracts despite\nevidence of off-market sales\n.\n\u201cEverything I\u2019ve said this year has been with an asterisk with 80 Clarkson next to it,\u201d Goodman\ntold The Real Deal last week\n.\nIn Brooklyn, there were 79 new development contracts signed in November, down from 110 last year.\nFall sales launches this year in Brooklyn have accounted for 172 new units entering the market, down 50 percent from last year, according to Marketproof.\nIn 2024, the borough launched a number of large developments, including One Domino Square and Williamsburg Wharf in North Brooklyn, which combined for a collective 249 units. The Bergen in Boerum Hill also launched its 105 units in 2024. Those buildings have often alternated among the top-performing developments in the borough through much of their early sales cycles.\nBy comparison, the top-selling development in November was an eight-unit converted brownstone at 503 Clinton Ave, which signed six contracts last month.\nQueens also slowed in November, with 20 contracts signed compared to 30 last year. The borough had no new development launches through October, when Flushing\u2019s Northern Center Condominium released 11 of its 135 sponsor units. In November, two boutique projects launched 13 combined units.\nLast fall, Queens saw 361 new development units enter the market.\n",

The firm is considering handing the keys to the property back to the lenders, though Bistricer believes he can resolve the issue with the lenders and duck foreclosure proceedings, tapping IronHound Management to assist Clipper through negotiations.\nStill, in a filing, Clipper said it \u201cdoes not plan to continue to support the ongoing operating and debt service shortfall related to\u201d the building, and would look to sell.\nIn March, the lenders notified lawyers for Bistricer that he was in default because Clipper did not deposit all of the requisite rental revenue into a designated account. They threatened to foreclose if Clipper didn\u2019t pay off the mortgage in full, according to filings, but have yet to do so.\nThe building was\ndealt a catastrophic blow\na few months ago when the city\u2019s Human Resources Administration exited 350,000 square feet, decamping for 2440 Fulton Street. Bistricer claims the firm is in negotiations with a tenant for a portion of that space, though he did not identify the tenant or how much they would take.\nThis isn\u2019t the first financial issue Bristricer has braced for in the Brooklyn office market.\nLast year, a Morningstar Credit report identified a delinquent loan behind 141 Livingston Street.

        "content": "JDL Development and Kayne Anderson Real Estate, the two developers involved in the troubled Lincoln Yards megaproject, want the Chicago City Council to approve a slate of high-rise apartments and residential units, according to a new zoning application submitted to the city.\nThe proposal covers roughly 34 acres between Lincoln Park and Bucktown,\nCrain\u2019s Chicago Business reported\n. Lincoln Yards is the overall name for a massive 53-acre mixed\u2011use redevelopment along the North Branch of the Chicago River. The\nnorthern section\nof the megaproject is called Foundry Park, with an estimated cost of more than $1 billion.\nThe apartment towers would exceed 450 feet, and in total Foundry Park would feature up to 3,737 housing units. Although less dense than Sterling Bay\u2019s original 14 million\u2011square\u2011foot version of the project, the plan still features large\u2011scale buildings that would significantly reshape the area.\nChicago-based Sterling Bay was the original developer that\nbacked out after the project stalled\n. The joint venture of Chicago-based JDL and Los Angeles-based Kayne Anderson bought most of\nthe site\nfrom\nBank OZK\n, which seized\u00a0 it from Sterling. The land was previously tied to the former Finkl steel mill and General Iron operations.\nJDL, led by CEO Jim Letchinger, is the developer on the project, with Kanye Anderson, led by CEO Albert Rabil as the equity partner.\nThe zoning application outlines a program combining single\u2011family homes, townhomes, condos and rental units, along with 350,000 square feet of office space, 420,000 square feet of retail and commercial space, plus 250,000 square feet of hospitality. The developers intend to build 3,207 units initially \u2014 305 for-sale homes and 2,902 rentals \u2014 including 641 affordable units for households earning an average of 60 percent of area median income.\nThe plan incorporates 12 acres of open space, six parks and a walk spanning most of the site\u2019s 3,000 feet of river frontage. Southport Avenue would serve as the project\u2019s primary corridor, lined with mid\u2011rise and high\u2011rise residential buildings and a hotel.\nThe first phase would rise on a triangular parcel bounded by Southport Avenue, West Cortland Street and North Kingsbury Street.\nA key complication is Sterling Bay\u2019s continued ownership of a northern parcel within the existing planned development. Sterling Bay consented to the rezoning only on the condition that it retains rights to build 400 units on its property.\nCity planning officials have emphasized the need for new infrastructure to manage traffic and improve site access. Negotiations continue over revisions to the existing redevelopment agreement, originally crafted for Lincoln Yards, which envisioned up to $490 million in infrastructure reimbursable with tax increment financing. Foundry Park\u2019s lower density may reduce the need for large infrastructure, though improvements to Dominick Street, Southport and a potential Southport\u2011Throop bridge remain under discussion.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

        "content": "San Francisco\u2019s beleaguered Oceanwide Center site is closer to coming under new ownership, five years after development stopped and left a gaping hole in the ground in South of Market.\nThe San Francisco Recovery Fund put down a nonrefundable deposit on the Oceanwide site at 50 First Street in a deal expected to value the parcel at about $100 million, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n, citing sources close to the deal. The deal is expected to close within the next two months. The exact deposit amount has not been disclosed.\nThe Recovery Fund, led by SKS Partners veteran Dan Kingsley and private equity alum Jay Yang, first entered a\ncontract to buy\nthe development site in September. With the deposit handed down, the Fund is nearing official ownership of the site.\nOceanwide Center\u2019s history dates back a decade when Chinese developer Oceanwide Holdings acquired the site in 2015 for nearly $300 million. At the time, the developer plotted to build a 2-million-square-foot mixed-use project with one 605-foot tower with hotel and residences and another 910-foot tower with offices and residential units. Groundbreaking was held the following year.\nIn 2019, Oceanwide Holdings started looking for new capital funding for the project. The firm sought development partners or buyers who would completely take over the project. Meanwhile, the Beijing-based company paused work on its mixed-use\nOceanwide Plaza project in Los Angeles\n, which sits abandoned and\ncovered in graffiti\ntoday.\nOceanwide Holdings stopped construction on Oceanwide Center\u2019s shorter building in 2019 and similarly paused work on the taller tower in the fall of 2020. The project came to a halt as the complex\u2019s ground-floor concrete structure was completed.\nOceanwide subsequently entered various possible deals with development and capital partners, but none of them ever came to fruition.\nCreditors seized the project site\nin 2021 after missed payments on $321.5 million of debt, and stakeholders are still involved in litigation over unpaid bills. Those companies still have about $21 million in liens on the Oceanwide site, the Business Times reported.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "John Novak is rapidly ascending the ranks of Chicago developers by striking a deal to buy the troubled southern portion of Lincoln Yards from JP Morgan Asset Management and Sterling Bay, following the sellers\u2019 failure to bring a massive commercial real estate plan to fruition.\nAn affiliate of Novak\u2019s contracting firm,\nNovak Construction\n, is moving forward with the acquisition of 18.4 acres of vacant riverfront land where Chicago-based Sterling Bay had proposed a huge mixed-use campus. It\u2019s just west of the empty life sciences building Sterling built at 1229 West Concord Place, John Novak and his firm\u2019s executive vice president of development, Jake Paschen, told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nWhile they declined to comment on the price of the acquisition, they confirmed it\u2019s well below the roughly $200 million Sterling and JP Morgan spent to assemble the parcels during the 2010s, as well as to prepare the parcels for development and carry them since then, according to people familiar with the project.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if this is at the bottom of the bottom, but I think there is more room for upside here than downside,\u201d Novak said. \u201cWe just need to figure out what will be the best value and use of the land.\u201d\nNovak expects to close before the end of 2025.\nThe deal brings a new face to a site that has become synonymous with development struggles in Chicago. Real estate insiders frame the acquisition as a distress sale, reflecting the difficulty the current owners have had in moving forward with the large redevelopment plan. The land, part of the larger, ambitious $6 billion mixed-use Lincoln Yards development, has been the subject of intense scrutiny and is changing hands as the original vision dissipated over the last two years.\nThe planned purchase marks the second time this year that a deal for the southern portion of the site has been put together, underscoring the urgency with which JP Morgan and Sterling Bay are now offloading the property. The first attempt to sell the site earlier this year to developers\nJDL and Kayne Anderson\n, at a price Chicago real estate sources pegged at about $60 million, ultimately fell apart.\nThat deal disintegrated after\nJP Morgan balked\non completing the transaction, leaving the future of the parcel uncertain until the recent emergence of Novak. Kayne and JDL this year formed a development team to buy the northern 30-plus acres of Lincoln Yards from\nBank OZK, which stripped that assemblage\nfrom Sterling Bay and its other partner, Dallas-based Lone Star Funds, through a deed in lieu of foreclosure. JDL and Kayne have since sought Chicago City Council approval to build\nmore than 3,700 residential units\non that stretch, which sits on the other side of the Chicago River from Novak\u2019s planned purchase.\n\u201cThe Lincoln Yards south property remains a huge opportunity, and we are interested in seeing it succeed,\u201d a spokesperson for Sterling Bay said.\nA spokesperson for JP Morgan declined to comment.\nFor Novak, the acquisition is a calculated risk and a major expansion of his development portfolio. The site along the Chicago River is considered a prime, albeit challenging, development opportunity. He has yet to decide what kind of buildings he will ultimately pursue for the site.\nThe overall Lincoln Yards project has been plagued by a number of issues, including initial political opposition to the massive public subsidies granted for the development, market volatility and a slowdown in commercial real estate demand that has hit large-scale office and retail projects particularly hard. The development was initially pitched as a comprehensive neighborhood with residential, commercial and entertainment components, transforming a former industrial area into a vibrant new section of Chicago.\nThe latest deal, led by an affiliate of Novak\u2019s firm, signals a renewed attempt to capitalize on the riverfront location and unlock the value of the land.\nNovak\u2019s firm was founded in 1980 as a general contractor, which remains its main business. But in the last five years it has accelerated its development efforts, Paschen and Novak said. Its development projects include the Whole Foods on West Belmont and Ashland avenues in Lakeview, as well as a 206-unit multifamily project with a 50,000-square-foot Target store in the Portage Park neighborhood, among other properties.\nNovak said the Lincoln Yards deal will mark the biggest amount of land his firm has purchased for development, but it isn\u2019t the largest in terms of the dollar amount of his other projects. He has also developed a $70 million medical office facility for the\nRush University\nhealth care system at 1630 North Harlem Avenue.\n",

        "content": "Pro-development organization YIMBY Law is taking\nGov. Gavin Newsom\nto court for his executive order banning Senate Bill 9\u2019s application in Los Angeles neighborhoods burned by the Palisades and Eaton fires.\nYIMBY Law\u2019s lawsuit\n, filed Wednesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleges that Newsom unlawfully restricted homeowners\u2019 ability to rebuild by giving local governments the green light to shelve SB 9, the 2021 state law that permits duplex construction and lot-splitting on parcels zoned for single-family homes, Politico\nreported\n.\nResidents in the Pacific Palisades appealed to Newsom over the summer to stop SB 9\u2019s implementation, fearing that allowing duplexes and split lots would diminish the neighborhood\u2019s character and make evacuation efforts in future fires worse.\nMayor Karen Bass\nand City Council member Traci Park similarly\nexpressed their opposition\nto SB 9\u2019s use in the Palisades.\nNewsom issued his order in July in response to the lobbying, from people including reality TV star and Palisades resident\nSpencer Pratt\n.\n\u201cMy parents survived the Eaton fire, but our home didn\u2019t,\u201d Altadena resident Andrew Post said in a news release from YIMBY Law. \u201cNow, as we want to rebuild and come back to the community we love, we\u2019re staring down costs we can\u2019t meet. SB 9 isn\u2019t a danger, it\u2019s a lifeline. It gives people like us a real chance to rebuild by creating rental income or making space for multiple generations and families to live on the same land. Taking that option away means pushing out the very people who are trying hardest to come back.\u201d\nAfter the governor handed down his order, the city governments of Los Angeles, Malibu and Pasadena, as well as Los Angeles County, put the kibosh on SB 9 rebuilds in areas prone to fires. YIMBY Law\u2019s suit includes each local jurisdiction as a defendant. The nonprofit claims SB 9 provides cash-strapped property owners the opportunity to earn rental income or sell a portion of their lot to pay for their rebuilding efforts.\nThe San Francisco-based group was in talks with Newsom\u2019s team last week about standing down on its lawsuit if the governor agreed to allow duplex construction after a year, YIMBY Law executive director Sonja Trauss told Politico. The Newsom camp didn\u2019t act, prompting the organization to pursue legal action.\nMost homeowners were under-insured, and now rents are spiking, land values are falling, and rebuilding costs are astronomical,\u201d Trauss said in a statement. \u201cMaking it harder for families to use the single most impactful tool they have left \u2014 their land \u2014 doesn\u2019t make recovery safer. It raises the barrier of who gets to come back at all.\u201d\nNewsom\u2019s team swiftly rebuked the lawsuit.\n\u201cWe will not allow outside groups \u2014 even longstanding allies \u2014 to attack the Palisades, and communities in the highest fire risk areas throughout L.A. County, or undermine local flexibility to rebuild after the horror of these fires,\u201d Newsom spokesperson Tara Gallegos told Politico. \u201cOur obligation is to survivors, full stop. We will not negotiate that away. If defending them requires drawing firm lines, we will draw them.\u201d\nPark, who represents the Palisades, also shared her disappointment with YIMBY Law\u2019s complaint.\n\u201cAfter what this community just lived through, the idea of forcing more density into a high-fire-severity zone demonstrates this isn\u2019t about sound housing policy, but ideological extremism,\u201d Park told Politico.\nWhether the banning of SB 9 in these neighborhoods was legal remains a question to be answered by the court as part of YIMBY Law\u2019s case.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Indicted attorney Mark Nussbaum revealed the list of all his creditors and debtors, providing more clues of where the missing money from his firm\u2019s escrow accounts went.\nThe lion\u2019s share of missing cash appears to stem from funds transferred to the late real estate investor Mendel Steiner, who Nussbaum claims owes over $306 million. Other notable names are: Shaya Prager, Eli Puretz, Boruch Drillman and Yanky Tauber.\nThe new filings provide a window into what went wrong for the once high-flying lawyer, whose law firm has about $400 million in unpaid creditors. Nussbaum provided the list of all the people who allegedly owe him money as part of an alternative to bankruptcy.\nNussbaum, who ran Manhattan-based Nussbaum Lowinger, used his law firm\u2019s escrow fund accounts to make bridge loans to real estate dealmakers, according to sources familiar with the situation. Often, his firm would provide money for one day so that the dealmaker could show a seller they were capitalized.\nBut Nussbaum started running a deficit, and investors and high-interest lenders who provided the funds for Nussbaum\u2019s escrow business started filing lawsuits seeking to recoup their money. Nussbaum\u2019s law firm shut down. In May, the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office charged Nussbaum with grand larceny, alleging he stole over $15 million in client escrow funds. Nussbaum has pleaded not guilty.\nCreditors allege in a new lawsuit that much of the funds were diverted to Steiner through phony escrow accounts.\nThe new information comes to light as Nussbaum started an alternative bankruptcy process, known as an assignment for the benefit of creditors (ABC), as a way to try to pay back his law firm\u2019s many creditors. As part of that process, Nussbaum had to provide a list of creditors along with the assets of his estate to the assignee of the ABC.\n\u201cAs he has from the outset, Mr. Nussbaum continues to provide exceptional assistance to the assignee. This includes providing information and troves of documents, as well as meeting with the assignee and its representatives on dozens of occasions for countless hours,\u201d said an attorney for Nussbaum in a statement. \u201cMr. Nussbaum fully supports the assignee\u2019s efforts to marshal assets from bona fide sources, including the Steiner estate, and he will continue to assist the assignee to the best of his ability to ensure maximum recovery for the creditors.\u201d\nNussbaum\u2019s assets included jewelry, wine and cryptocurrency, but his largest asset is his accounts receivables. Nussbaum has hundreds of millions of dollars on the street and borrowers who had not paid him back.\nSome of Nussbaum\u2019s notable debtors include participants in mortgage fraud schemes that led to charges by the Department of Justice. Others include nursing home investors and syndicators, according to Nussbaum\u2019s filing.\nBoruch Drillman\n, a co-conspirator who played a minor role in a $165 million mortgage fraud scheme and was not sentenced to any jail time, owes $4.7 million.\nEli Puretz, a co-conspirator in a $54.5 million mortgage fraud scheme involving an office complex in Troy, Michigan, owes $4.1 million.\nOpal Holdings head\nShaya Prager\n, a controversial investor who has come under pressure from lenders over his ground lease-structures within a multi-billion-dollar office portfolio, owes $1.1 million.\nYanky Tauber\n, Nussbaum\u2019s deal partner on Chicago real estate, owes $1.5 million.\nMike Silber, the brother of Moshe Silber, who pleaded guilty in a $119 million mortgage fraud scheme involving an apartment complex in Cincinnati, Ohio, owes $2.25 million.\nSteve Chopp, a nursing home owner tied to Indigo Manner and Opal Healthcare, owes $3 million.\nThe filings also reveal more about the scale of Nussbaum\u2019s real estate operations. In addition to lending to real estate dealmakers, Nussbaum acquired real estate properties. His assets consisted of properties scattered throughout the country, including in Chicago; Brooklyn; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and Long Island, according to his filings.\nHe listed a 346,000-square-foot office park in Lake Success, New York as his most valuable real estate asset at $33 million. Other real estate interests include walk-ups at 1596 and 1474 Pacific Street in Brooklyn, as well as 1049 Bergen Street in Brooklyn.\nNussbaum\u2019s assets include: $2 million in crypto; $91,000 in wine and alcohol, including a $1,000 bottle of Glendronach scotch. He also reported that he sold over $200,000 in watches and jewelry.\nNussbaum provided a long list of creditors who he or his firms owe money to, including Jacob Sod \u2014 the nursing home owner who initiated the litigation against Nussbaum\u2019s law firm \u2014 who has a claim of $14.2 million.\nSomeone named S. Zafir is the largest creditor, with a $148 million claim. Miriam Nussbaum, Nussbaum\u2019s mother, is owed over $1 million, according to Nussbaum\u2019s filings.\nWhile some of Nussbaum\u2019s creditors\u2019 claims stretch into the millions, there are dozens for smaller amounts, including over $500,000 owed to Lazer Preizler of the hard money lender Cashable.\nNussbaum\u2019s ability to collect on the many loans he made has proven to be difficult because of the indictment and charges brought by the Manhattan D.A.\nSimilarly, calculating the value of Nussbaum\u2019s existing real estate has been a challenge.\nMark Nussbaum\nand his deal partner, Eli Tauber, have been hit with a combined 29 foreclosure lawsuits for real estate across the South and West sides of Chicago.\nNussbaum does not appear to know the exact state of his properties with Eli\u2019s son Yanky Tauber. In Nussbaum\u2019s filings, he mentioned that some of his real estate with Tauber has been sold or transferred.\n",

        "content": "Despite efforts to stop the sale, Meyer Chetrit\u2019s ownership interests in four property-holding companies have been sold at auction to pay off a lender.\nThe buyers were Meyer\u2019s brother, Juda Chetrit, and an entity associated with lender Maverick Real Estate Partners.\nThe sale, held on Tuesday, was the\nlatest episode\nin the legal saga between Meyer Chetrit and Maverick Real Estate Partners, which is trying to collect on a $132 million judgment from the prominent developer connected to a now-foreclosed Manhattan hotel property. Chetrit served as a guarantor on the loan. Now that he hasn\u2019t paid a judgment ordered in June, his interests have been garnished and are being auctioned off to pay for the judgment.\nThe public sale held on Tuesday didn\u2019t draw any new faces. In a conference room at the offices of law firm Fox Rothschild, Juda Chetrit and Thomas Hooker, a representative for Maverick, traded bids on Meyer\u2019s ownership interests.\nJuda Chetrit was flanked by his son Michael, who now heads the Chetrit Organization. The two sat on the other end of a conference table from Meyer, separated by attorneys. Juda and Michael bid, seemingly reluctantly, on Meyer\u2019s interests in a company that owns several industrial lots in Maspeth, Queens. That includes a warehouse at 57-18 Flushing Avenue.\nBut Maverick\u2019s deeper pockets won out. The firm\u2019s representative agreed to pay $9.8 million for the interest.\nThe Maverick associate also agreed to pay $1 million for a pair of LLCs associated with a largely undeveloped lot in Woodside at 70-50 Queens Boulevard. The lot was previously home to an Entemann\u2019s bakery outlet. According to court documents from Meyer Chetrit, the developer effectively has a 16.5 percent interest in the property, which he says is worth between $12 million and $15 million, but has no income. Chetrit\u2019s lawyers say the value of his interest in the property is negative or negligible, given that the property is encumbered by a $5 million mortgage and owes other funds to a managing member.\nJuda Chetrit won a bidding exchange to pay $750,000 for Meyer\u2019s interests in an LLC tied to two condo units at 49-51 Chambers Street in Manhattan. The units are worth about $6.5 million, according to an affidavit from Meyer. They have been cross-collateralized with other assets for a $9.5 million mortgage. Juda is already a member of the company owning the condos, according to an affidavit he filed in court. The two are unsold sponsor units from an office-to-condo conversion that opened in 2017.\nMeyer and Juda Chetrit head different organizations, the Chetrit Group and Chetrit Organization, respectively, but still conduct some deals together. The two, with their brother Joseph and\nlate brother Jacob\n, together comprised the patriarchs of the influential development family.\nLawyers for Meyer Chetrit, including\nattorney Leo Jacobs\n, attempted to stop the sale. They petitioned the court to pause the auction, arguing that the sale would depress Chetrit\u2019s ability to pay the $132 million judgment and fail to generate maximum value. Chetrit is \u201cwilling to consider\u201d a sale marketed by a broker, according to the petition.\n\u201cChetrit has even been compelled to consider filing for personal bankruptcy,\u201d the petition says. Personal bankruptcy would potentially put a pause on litigation and collection efforts.\nA lower court judge declined to put a temporary restraining order on the sale. Chetrit\u2019s lawyers appealed that decision, but the case is still pending. Jacobs said he objected to how the sale was conducted, saying the terms of sale needed to be distributed prior to the auction and bidders needed to be registered.\n\u201cToday\u2019s auction is a textbook definition of how not to conduct an auction,\u201d Jacobs said in a statement.\nTwo rounds of the auction were conducted before the terms of sale were distributed. Jacobs objected, prompting a do-over of the sales.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Maverick and Chetrit have found themselves in court over the $132 million judgment, which originated from a default on a loan connected to a yet-to-open hotel tower at 255 West 34th Street.\nThe lender previously tried to halt payments between Chetrit and business associates, claiming they were\nfraudulent attempts to shield his assets\n.\nThe courtroom drama is just one of the problems facing Chetrit. The developer and his brother Joseph were\nindicted earlier this year\nfor allegedly harassing septuagenarians in a rent-regulated loft unit. The Chetrits, through attorneys, have denied the allegations and pleaded not guilty.\n",

Katz\u2019s family run firm is a prolific investor in South Florida shopping centers, buying and selling properties that consistently trade at competitive prices. A former professional basketball player,\nKatz\nis also a minority owner of the Miami Heat.\nRK paid $391 a square foot for the 92,007-square-foot retail facility. That\u2019s about $8.6 million above the previous sale price six years ago.\nThe seller, an affiliate of Toronto-based Northbridge Capital, led by Stuart, Michael and Adam Lazier, paid $27.4 million for the\n10.2-acre site\nin 2019, records show. The property is adjacent to a Walmart Supercenter that was built by the same developer,\nGatlin Development Co\n. The big box store and the shopping center were completed between 2017 and 2019.\nRiverbend Marketplace\u2019s tenants include Marshalls, Planet Fitness, Five Below, Wells Fargo and Chipotle.\nRiverbend is the second Broward shopping center that RK bought this year. In April, an RK affiliate paid\n$16.4 million\nfor Shoppes at Monarch Lakes, a Miramar shopping center anchored by a Publix supermarket. Other tenants include Dunkin\u2019, Subway and Banfield Pet Hospital. Katz\u2019s company also bought a furniture showroom in Pembroke Pines for\n$15.2 million\nin January.\nA flurry of shopping center deals have closed recently in Broward.\nIn Coral Springs, four such properties traded last month.

In the third quarter, the county\u2019s retail landlords experienced a vacancy rate of 3.9 percent, relatively unchanged from the same period last year when it was 3.7 percent, according to Colliers.

The deal was financed with $113 million in senior secured debt from Northwind Group and $100 million in equity, including $25 million in preferred equity from Atlas Capital Group.\nThe financing covers the acquisition and predevelopment phase of the project, according to the release.\nThe closing comes almost two years after Landau, the former CEO of Fortis Property Group,\nfiled plans\nwith the Department of Buildings for a 47-story tower.\nThe mixed-use project will include 46 condo units, 90 rental apartments and 40,000 square feet of retail space. Construction is expected to begin early next year.\nThe release indicates that the Cayre family\u2019s Midtown Equities, which had bought the site for $33 million in 2010, is staying on as one of the project\u2019s sponsors. The family had put the site up\nfor sale in 2015, seeking $200 million\n.\nThe release does not indicate what plans exist, if any, for the neighboring 195 Montague Street, which had been included as part of the initial building application filed by Landau last year.\nThe site sits at the intersection of Brooklyn Heights and Downtown Brooklyn. If completed, the 672-foot tower will be one of the neighborhood\u2019s tallest properties, and a marked divergence from the brownstone-lined streets that have drawn\nrecord townhouse deals.\nEstreich\u2019s Raffi Landau represented Northwind and Rosewood Realty Group\u2019s Aaron Jungreis represented Atlas in the deal.\nThe project \u201cis well positioned to benefit from sustained demand in this supply-stricken neighborhood,\u201d Ran Eliasaf, Northwind founder and managing partner, said in a statement.\nLandau is making good on his forecast issued during a panel at\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s New York Forum,\nwhen he said\nit\u2019s a \u201cdamn good time to be building in New York City.\u201d\nThe developer\u2019s other projects since leaving Fortis have been in South Florida.

Turnbridge is planning to develop a luxury hotel, branded condominiums and estates. Phase one of the development is estimated to cost $735 million. Lionheart Strategic Management provided pre-development financing.\nThe unfinished resort\u2019s prior developer, Robert Green, defaulted on debt and later filed for bankruptcy \u2014 $270.5 million in claims, all told, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Robert Green Company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nPrior estimates put the property\u2019s value at $300 million to $400 million, the Desert Sun\nreported\n.\nThe 130-acre purchase comes after years of delays and about a year in bankruptcy court. The deal works out to $500,000 per acre and was approved by the court in October.\nTurnbridge\nwanted to purchase the development as soon as it entered bankruptcy, founder and managing principal Andrew Joblon said. Turnbridge West Coast managing director Michael Gazzano is on the project.\nGreen, who was sued by the city over delays before declaring bankruptcy, led the project for a decade. He had plans to develop residential, commercial and two hotels on the land. The hotels were supposed to have Montage and Pendry flags.\nTurnbridge plans to develop one five-star hotel, not two \u2014 although it hasn\u2019t struck a deal yet. Estates and branded condominiums are part of the plan as well. The acreage is entitled for hotel rooms, condos and estates, and the company has options to buy another 200 acres. Once the hotel opens, the 165-acre SilverRock Golf Course, owned by the city but set to be transferred, would follow.\nThe property, at 79179 Ahmanson Lane, isn\u2019t far from where the annual Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and Stagecoach Music Festival are held.\nThe site is within the greater Palm Springs\narea\n. It is near the Hideaway and the Madison Club, two ultra-exclusive golf and residential communities. The latter is\nhome\nto some\nA-list celebrities and executives\n.\n",

        "content": "NexPoint Diversified Real Estate Trust is advancing its $445 million plan to transform Dallas\u2019 Cityplace Tower into a large mixed\u2011use development.\nDuring an investor call on Tuesday, the firm reported significant progress on financing, design and hotel logistics for repositioning the 42\u2011story, 560\u2011foot tower along U.S. 75, the\nDallas Business Journal reported\n. NexPoint,\nbased in Dallas\n, acquired the property in 2018.\nThe redevelopment gained momentum after Neiman Marcus announced\nearlier this year\nthat it would vacate its headquarters in the building after only two years. NexPoint \u2019s plan calls for converting portions of the existing office tower into residential units and hotel rooms, while adding eight six\u2011story apartment buildings across the largely underdeveloped land surrounding 2711 North Haskell Avenue.\nThe redevelopment is structured in four phases, with the first major component \u2014 known as \u201cThe Apron\u201d \u2014 focused on building 465 apartments on 5.6 acres adjacent to the tower.\nNexPoint Executive Vice President Matt McGraner said the company has received \u201caccretive financing proposals\u201d for The Apron and expects to select a lender within 30 to 60 days.\nGroundbreaking is anticipated within six to nine months.\nOn the hospitality side, NexPoint is working with Marriott International, which has proposed two lifestyle hotel brands aimed at complementing the project\u2019s upscale residences. Marriott previously pitched a business\u2011oriented hotel concept, but has since shifted direction to better align with the project. NexPoint also worked with the company on the\nMarriott Dallas Uptown\nproperty.\nMcGraner also discussed broader multifamily market dynamics, noting that the national supply cycle is peaking. CoStar projects annual completions across the U.S. of 695,000 units \u2014 about 3.5 percent of inventory \u2014 over the next year, followed by sharp declines: a 27 percent year\u2011over\u2011year drop in 2026, and a further 20 percent decline in 2027. This slowdown is expected to push the market from today\u2019s\ncompetitive lease\u2011up environment\ninto a supply\u2011constrained period characterized by renewed rent growth.\nNexPoint believes the timing will prove advantageous for Cityplace, positioning the project to have its new units completed as national supply tightens. The building, built in 1988 and originally envisioned as part of a two\u2011tower complex connected by a sky bridge, remains the tallest building in Dallas outside the Downtown core.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

The video was posted by a user with the name St. Tropez on the Bay II on the Sunny Isles Beach Insider Facebook page.\nGary Mars, the association attorney, told officers that the association president was trying to cancel the election, \u201cwhich prompted Mr. Gold to obstruct entry,\u201d the police report says.\nGold, who said he was at the meeting \u201cas the president\u2019s assistant,\u201d didn\u2019t deny he stepped in at the meeting and said he had reason to.\nHe alleges the meeting was the culmination of weeks of infighting between association president Boris Benjaminov and its property management firm, KW Property Management. Gold alleges that KW had \u201chijacked\u201d the election process and organized it as \u201can outsider,\u201d even though the board or the president have to vote on and have final say on election procedures. KW acted without permission from the board, Gold said. He also said some unit owners reported issues with the online voting system.\nBenjaminov couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. KW didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\u201cThat basic prerequisite of having a board or the proper officer acting on behalf of the board calling for an annual meeting for the election never happened,\u201d Gold said. \u201cI may not be the most popular guy for stepping in but at least in helping the president, we are going to have a proper election.\u201d\nNow, they will seek a court order to have an independent monitor oversee the election, Gold said. He said that if he hadn\u2019t acted, then St. Tropez residents would today have \u201ctwo boards, two presidents and a referee for the next year.\u201d\nCriminal charges weren\u2019t pressed against Gold, according to the police report.\nMars said the election will be held at a future meeting. He declined to comment further.\nThe St. Tropez on the Bay II Facebook user alleged Gold isn\u2019t a unit owner at the building but a guest of his wife. Gold declined to address whether he owns a St. Tropez condo. He said he won\u2019t be \u201cdiscussing personal issues.\u201d\nGold is not listed in property records as a unit owner.\n\u201cWhether or not I live there is irrelevant,\u201d he added.\nBoard elections are a common source of issues at South Florida condo associations. After months of litigation at the two-tower\n1060 Brickell\ncondo in Miami\u2019s Brickell, a judge sided with unit owners seeking to oust former president Jacob Kessler. In September, the judge\nordered\na new board to replace the former directors and also ordered the former directors to turn over all records and control of the association.\nSouth Florida\u2019s largest homeowners association, The Hammocks, was at the center of the\nbiggest alleged board fraud scheme\nin recent memory in which ex-leaders allegedly siphoned millions of dollars from HOA coffers. The Hammocks also had issues with elections: At the 2022 election, before police arrested four former board members and the husband of one of the ex-board members, voting polls closed early, infuriating homeowners. The former board cited a bomb threat for the early closure, but investigators said the HOA never provided\nproof of this\n.\nThe former Hammocks president, another ex-board member and the third person arrested have pleaded not guilty, and are awaiting trial. Two other board members arrested pleaded guilty and are cooperating with investigators.\n",

Monument originally purchased the property for $68 million in 2017.\nThe Element is classified as workforce housing, offering rents affordable to tenants who earn too much to qualify for subsidies, but struggle with full market\u2011rate pricing. The complex\u2019s average asking rent is $1,658 per month, or $1.69 per square foot, according to CoStar.

In January, the two companies jointly acquired a Hoffman Estates\napartment complex\nfor $75.8 million.\nBoth Bender and Eastham have experience in the Chicago suburban multifamily market, where projects\ngenerally trade\nat higher valuations as people avoid homebuying due to high interest rates, Crain\u2019s noted, with Mount Prospect a particularly\nactive market\n.\nChicago-based Bender Companies is an owner-operator of multifamily properties in Nebraska, Wisconsin, Illinois and Michigan, according to its website. Principal Kurt Bender founded the company in 2011. Earlier this year the company sold a suburban\napartment property\nin Carol Stream for $54 million.\nBender told Crain\u2019s in an email that suburban Chicago is the company\u2019s strongest market for occupancy.\nBoca Raton, Florida-based Eastham Capital is a private equity firm specializing in multifamily and working with both market-rate apartments and affordable housing.

The fund was created to provide developers with low-cost financing to aid in paying construction costs for affordable housing projects. The new round of funding includes commitments from Valhalla Impact, the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation, philanthropists Leah and Ben Spero and congressional candidate Saikat Chakrabarti.\nFlush with $100 million, SFHAF\u2019s Bay Area Housing Innovation Fund will reportedly help to finance and build more than 1,000 affordable homes in the next two years.\nThe Bay Area Housing Innovation Fund offers traditional first mortgage loans as well as second mortgage loans repayable from projects\u2019 residual cash flow. The fund centers around developments that \u201cutilize innovative design, construction and financing approaches to deliver homes faster and at lower cost compared to traditionally financed projects, targeting completion twice as fast and at cost savings of 25 percent or more,\u201d the Housing Accelerator Fund said, per the Chronicle.\nCase in point: SFHAF\u2019s first project, a 145-unit residential property in San Francisco for formerly homeless seniors, cost $525,000 per unit \u2014 a deal considering 17 of the last 23 affordable housing projects in San Francisco that received state tax credit funding in recent years cost more than $900,000 per unit. That development at 1633 Valencia Street is set to complete later this month.\nAnother project, dubbed Harvey West Studios, is underway in Santa Cruz. When completed next year, it will be Santa Cruz County\u2019s largest permanent supportive housing development.\nWith a beefed-up Bay Area Housing Innovation Fund, the Housing Accelerator Fund is looking to invest in several new endeavors, already committing to\nAffirmed Housing\u2019s transit-oriented development\nplan next to the Berryessa BART station in north San Jose. That 195-unit project will consist entirely of affordable residences and is expected to cost less than $750,000 per unit.\nOther affordable projects tied to the Housing Innovation Fund are reportedly being considered in Alameda, San Mateo and San Francisco Counties, according to the Chronicle. Those developments are expected to be announced early next year.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

With a listing price of $3.5 million, the top contract was for a six-bedroom, six-bathroom spec home about 40 minutes west of Downtown Austin at 16114 Cool Breeze Cove.\nThe final sale price is unavailable, but the asking price amounts to about $600 per square foot for 5,700-square-foot home.\nA husband-and-wife team constructed and sold the property. Terra Builders, a local custom homebuilding company owned by Jim and Julie Lavender, completed the house this year. Julie Lavender is the listing agent.\nThe cul-de-sac property sits on 2.6 acres near Little Barton Creek, and the lot has already been pre-approved for a 900-square-foot guest house, according to the listing. Amenities include a pool, an outdoor kitchen and a secret room.\nThe second-most expensive luxury home to go under contract last week was also recently built, in 2024, though not apparently as a spec project. The 4,500-square-foot house, at 4107 North Hills Drive in the Northwest Hills neighborhood, has five bedrooms and six bathrooms. It was initially meant to be the sellers\u2019 \u201cforever home,\u201d according to Moreland Properties agent Greg Walling. The sellers, Tamir and Marina Hardof, had priced the home at $3.46 million when the contract was signed, or about $770 per square foot. The tech-packed property is pure Austin with Tesla Poweralls, solar panels and a full smart-home system.\nNotably, the\nspec home held fast to its original $3.5 million listing price\n. The resale home\u00a0 originally listed for $3.75 million in September. Its price was cut in October and November, representing a\ncommon struggle\nfor luxury resale inventory in\nAustin\n, especially for\nsellers who bought their homes during the mid- and post-pandemic boom\n.\n",

        "content": "City Council members have several housing-related bills on their desks, including a new version of the\nCommunity Opportunity to Purchase Act\n, or COPA, and measures that some groups estimate will drive up the cost of city-funded housing by millions of dollars.\nCouncil members worked to finalize these bills on Wednesday to ensure they could be voted on at their final meeting of the year \u2014 and under the Adams administration \u2014 next week. Bills must age seven days (not including Sundays) before they can be called to a vote.\nAging doesn\u2019t guarantee a bill will be placed on the next agenda, but several measures closely watched, and in many cases feared, by property owners and developers are eligible.\n\u201cIf the most recent legislation aged by the City Council is approved next week, the real-world effect is simple: we will build less housing,\u201d Real Estate Board of New York President Jim Whelan said in a statement.\nCOPA, amended\nIn preparation for next week, the Council released a new version of COPA that applies to a smaller universe of multifamily buildings and would further reduce the time that nonprofits (and, if applicable, their private partners) are given first dibs to buy these properties. The basic principle, however, is the same: When the owner of certain multifamily buildings decides to sell, they have to first allow nonprofits approved by the city (or private companies, also approved by the city, that partner with nonprofits) the first chance to bid on the buildings.\nThe latest version of the measure, sponsored by Council member Sandy Nurse, still applies to multifamily buildings with four or more units that have a certain level of unpaid tax liens, unresolved violations or that have affordability requirements expiring within the next two years.\nThe amended bill tweaked some of these qualifications.\nThe bill would no longer apply to buildings that had affordability requirements expire in the past two years, nor to those with unpaid municipal charges totaling $1,500 or more per unit, as was the case in the bill introduced\nlast week\n.\nBuildings enrolled in the city\u2019s alternative enforcement program would still be subject to COPA, but this requirement would kick in if the building has been part of the program for at least a year. The new version also no longer includes vacant properties zoned for housing.\nThe bill still applies to buildings that were denied a certification of no harassment from the city (a process where owners must demonstrate to the city that they haven\u2019t harassed their tenants) within the past year.\nThe measure further limits the exclusivity window for these deals. After receiving notice of an owner\u2019s intent to sell, nonprofits and qualifying joint ventures (dubbed qualified entities) have 25 days to notify an owner that they are interested in bidding on a property.\nOnce that time runs out, the qualified entities have 80 days to submit an offer. The previous version of the bill created a 135-day window, while the latest measure calls for 105 days. As was the case previously, qualified entities have 15 days after a competing bid comes in to match it.\nThese changes are not likely to assuage the bill\u2019s fiercest critics, who objected to the idea of having HPD act as a middleman in these deals. Landlords and brokers\nargued\nthat the measure will disrupt the residential market and scare away would-be investors, while proponents see COPA as leveling the playing field for nonprofits and community land trusts.\nMore controversial bills\nPro-housing groups are particularly concerned that the Council will pass a package of bills that would add new restrictions to city-funded housing.\nIn a letter sent to the Council last week, the New York Housing Conference and other groups urged against the passage of five measures that, together, they estimated would increase the Department of Housing Preservation and Development\u2019s budgetary needs by $1.3 billion.\nOne of the\nbills\nrequires that, of the housing units built or preserved using city funding, at least 50 percent must be affordable for extremely and very low-income households, and at least 30 percent for very low-income households (both are\nfederally defined\nterms). The latest iteration limits the universe of buildings that would count toward that overall percentage, excluding buildings with fewer than 75 units.\nAnother would set minimum percentages for the amount of city-funded units that have two- to three-bedrooms. An amended version of the bill adds a number of carveouts to the pool of projects that would count toward those overall percentages, excluding projects where at least 50 percent of the units are reserved for seniors, that have fewer than 20 units, where more than 30 percent are supportive housing units and projects that have received key approvals by a certain date.\nUnder the bill, starting July 1, 2027, HPD must ensure that, over a five-year period, at least 25 percent of the dwelling units financed by the city are two-bedroom units and at least 15 percent have three bedrooms or more. The amended bill also specifies that HPD can adjust these percentages if federal housing funding is cut by 50 percent or more, compared to the prior four years, or if the city sees a \u201ccomplete loss of availability of such resources to fund newly constructed affordable housing.\u201d\nEmily Eisner, an economist at the Fiscal Policy Institute who is also on Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani\u2019s housing transition committee, warned in a report released Thursday that applying these rules to city-funded special needs and supportive housing would lead to fewer units being built for these vulnerable populations (larger units are more expensive to build).\nIn an interview, she said that while the changes to limit the scope of these measures were welcome, the newer versions of the bills still don\u2019t address the time and cost of adding new restrictions.\n\u201cLegislating these size requirements puts major new requirements into HPD\u2019s funding pipeline, which will slow the development of affordable housing units,\u201d she said.\nThrough a spokesperson, Council leadership pushed back on this criticism.\n\u201cThe city\u2019s public dollars should be used to support the development of affordable housing that best meets New Yorkers\u2019 affordability needs,\u201d a City Council spokesperson said in a statement.\u00a0 \u201cThese bills prioritize a use of public dollars for maximum affordability and serving the needs of families and residents with the greatest housing needs, rather than to just build a higher number of less affordable apartments that fail to serve them.\u201d\nAnother bill would set a minimum percentage of city-funded homeownership units, but a separate measure that would limit the percentage of city-funded studio apartments in senior housing projects did not make the aging list.\nThe union-backed Construction Justice Act, which would set $40 per hour minimum wages and benefits for construction workers on housing projects that are funded by $1.5 million or more in city financing, also advanced Wednesday. The New York Housing Conference has estimated that the measure would add $750 million to HPD\u2019s production costs, a figure supporters have disputed.\nAfter expressing disappointment about a previous version of the bill that carved out certain affordable housing projects, the Mason Tenders\u2019 District Council said Thursday that it is satisfied with where the measure landed.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been proud to champion this effort from the start and believe the CJA will help deliver our city\u2019s construction workforce the standards they deserve,\u201d David Bolger, business manager for the district council, said in a statement. \u201cPassing it would be a monumental achievement for this Council.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Happy holidays, here are half a dozen new versions of City Council bills you hate.\n\u201cYou\u201d refers to landlords, brokers, developers and others who have been closely tracking and\ndreading bills\nlike the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act.\nNext week is the City Council\u2019s final meeting, and COPA, along with a package of controversial housing regulation bills, managed to squeak through to the aging list. That means they could be called for a vote on Thursday. Bill aging could also refer to the years shaved off my life today as I tried to figure out when the latest versions of these bills would be made public and what they included.\nHere\u2019s a cheat sheet of the bills that aged and some of the most notable changes included in the latest versions:\nCOPA\n\u2014 No longer applies to vacant properties zoned for residential.\n\u2014 No longer applies to buildings that had affordability requirements expire in the past two years, nor to those with unpaid municipal charges totaling $1,500 or more per unit.\n\u2014 New version specifies that properties enrolled in the alternative enforcement program qualify if they have been part of the program for at least a year.\n\u2014 Shortens the exclusivity timeframe to 105 days (25 plus 80), down from 135 and 180 before that.\nConstruction Justice Act\n\u2014 Applies to housing projects receiving $1.5 million or more in city financing, up from previously proposed $1 million.\n\u2014 Excludes supportive housing.\n\u2014 Applies to projects that create or preserve 150 units or more, instead of 100 units.\nAir conditioning law\n\u2014\nRequires landlords to provide cooling systems (between June 15 and Sept. 12) that keep \u201ccovered rooms\u201d at a maximum air temperature of 78 degrees Fahrenheit. \u201cCovered rooms\u201d apply to a tenant\u2019s primary sleeping space, rather than the whole unit.\n\u2014\u00a0Rent-regulated tenants elect to have their apartment covered by the law. The new version specifies that rent-regulated tenants must consent to improvements to comply with the law and the charges associated with it (as permitted by state law, which only allows the landlord to recoup a portion of the cost of individual apartment improvements through rent increases). This is a win for rent-stabilized owners.\nHPD termsheet bills:\nMinimum percentage of two- and three-unit apartments funded by city\n\u2014\nCarves out projects where 50 percent of the units are reserved for seniors, those that have fewer than 20 units, projects where more than 30 percent are supportive housing units and projects that have received key approvals by a certain date.\n\u2014 Specifies that HPD can adjust these percentages if federal housing funding is cut by 50 percent or more, compared to the prior four years, or if the city sees a \u201ccomplete loss of availability of such resources to fund newly constructed affordable housing.\u201d\nMinimum affordability for city-funded housing units\n\u2014\u00a0Limits the universe of buildings that would count toward that overall percentage, excluding buildings with fewer than 75 units and those that have secured key approvals by certain dates.\nMinimum homeownership units in city-funded projects:\nNo amended version posted yet.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: If you read the above and thought, \u201cHey, she forgot about this change!\u201d or \u201cActually, I have no fear of that passing because I think this bill won\u2019t pass or even come to a vote because I know something,\u201d please send details to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n. This was my first crack at these bills, some of which weren\u2019t posted until late Thursday.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Newark International Airport was built in 1928 on 68 acres of marshland, which was filled in with things you would expect, like mud dredged from Newark Bay and dry dirt, as well as some more surprising items, like 7,000 discarded Christmas trees and 200 bank safes donated by a junk dealer, according to the 2009 book \u201cNewark Airport,\u201d by Henry Holden. (H/T to my husband, who passed along this tidbit.)\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Gov. Kathy Hochul has more than 150 bills waiting on her desk,\nGothamist reports\n. One of those bills would increase cameras and oversight at the state\u2019s prisons, and another would add safety requirements to artificial intelligence models. President Donald Trump has pledged to preempt states from passing such measures.\n\u2014 Soon after his win in November, Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani tried to pump the brakes on the race for the next City Council speaker by asking unions, party leaders and individual Council members to hold off on endorsing a candidate,\nPolitico New York reports\n. He and his team then tried to figure out how to influence the competition, but Politico reports that these efforts came too late. Council member Julie Menin declared victory in late November.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$12.5 million\nfor a 3,541-square-foot condominium at 11 North Moore Street in Tribeca.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$7 million\nfor a\n6,750-square-foot multi-family townhouse at 198 Sixth Avenue in Soho. Paul Murphy and Edward Svec with Compass\nhad the listing\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$16 million\nfor a 4,400-square-foot condominium at 92 Laight Street in Tribeca. The Leonard Steinberg Team at Compass has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new project filing for 6 individual new building permits for a total of 360 affordable units in East New York. Permits were filed by Michael Gelfand, AIA, on behalf of Rona Reodica, Assistant Commissioner for the Division of Building and Land Development Services.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "The Miami City Commission approved a Watson Island land sale that will allow the Motwani family\u2019s Merrimac Ventures and BH3 to develop a plot on the southwest side of the island into a mixed-use project with a condo component.\nThe proposal drew criticism from residents, who called it a \u201cbad deal\u201d and urged commissioners not to rush the vote.\n\u201cResidents have sued the city because of the issue with Watson Island before, and have taken a vote to ensure the sale of Watson Island is of fair market value,\u201d Miami resident Gilbert Palacios said. \u201cWe can use responsible and good development in our city like we have done in the past. \u2026 This is a bad deal for the city, a bad deal for residents, a bad deal for workers.\u201d\nCommissioner Ralph Rosado was the sole no vote. Rosado wanted the city to hire Cushman &amp; Wakefield to complete an independent appraisal of the property.\n\u201cAt this time, I would like to be confident that we\u2019ve negotiated the best possible deal for the city, and I\u2019m not there at the moment,\u201d Rosado said. \u201cI do think that there is room to make this a better deal that\u2019s more responsive to our residents and our taxpayers. \u2026 Not only do I think that there\u2019s room for additional public benefits, but I have concerns about the fact that the purchaser could, in fact \u2026 turn around and flip the property, and that has major consequences.\u201d\nBut Rosado\u2019s motion failed to pass, and instead commissioners approved the sale resolution. The commission had deferred taking action, most recently at a November meeting.\nThe controversy stems from an appraisal that found the land could be worth between $257 million and $342 million, the\nMiami Herald\nreported. But the developers say that the existing long-term lease devalues the land.\nIt\u2019s been\nmore than a year since\n64 percent of Miami voters approved the sale of about 3.2 acres at 888 MacArthur Causeway to IG Luxury, the BH3-Merrimac venture.\nThe price of the land is now pegged at $29 million. As part of the deal, the developers will provide $9 million that\u2019s to be used for affordable housing and infrastructure improvements. The city will also negotiate the release of deed restrictions on the land with the state for $4 million. (Voters also approved a referendum to sell land on the east side of the island\nto Terra and ESJ\nCapital Partners.)\nThe change will allow the developers to build about 100 condos instead of previously approved timeshare units. The developers will continue to lease the remaining 7-plus acres of land that the city is retaining ownership of.\nBH3 and Merrimac formed a joint venture in 2023 to\ntake over the lease\nfrom the former developer, Mehmet Bayraktar\u2019s Flagstone Property Group. Flagstone was tangled in years of delays and litigation with the city of Miami. Voters approved Bayraktar\u2019s deal via a referendum in 2001, but his firm only completed a portion of the then-planned project.\nAt Thursday\u2019s meeting, commissioners deferred a final vote on\na proposal that would allow\ndevelopers to double their density in specific neighborhoods, starting with Edgewater.\n",

Renderings depict a walkable layout with restaurants, entertainment venues and retail connected by meandering paths with parking integrated close to activity areas.\nThe lawn is designed to host concerts, seasonal markets, games or even ice skating in winter, aiming to capture the nostalgia of the Stratford Square Mall but in a contemporary format.\nCoStar News reported\nthe whole center will have more than 400,000 square feet and will take five to seven years for construction.\nThe Grove at Bloomingdale signed its first tenant.\nHB Investments, led by CEO Bill Gust, will operate a 100,000-square-foot indoor sports complex called Bloomingdale Yard, built on the model of the company\u2019s other operations at Naperville Yard and Milwaukee Yard. The complex, slated to open in 2027 near a free-standing Kohl\u2019s, will offer indoor fields, childcare, youth programs and adult recreation. Gust said he had eyed the location for years.\nThe Daily Herald also reported regional restaurateurs are looking at the venue, and an unnamed developer may build a 280-unit apartment complex as part of the project.\nAs for financing, the village is preparing to sell $52 million in bonds to fund infrastructure improvements, including the lake and public spaces set to break ground next year.\nBloomingdale Village President\nFranco Coladipietro\nsaid the project will try to replace the old mall concept with an \u201cexperience-first\u201d appeal in the context of the\nBloomingdale retail market\n.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

        "content": "For sellers of condos in downtown Chicago, success may be based on how much of a loss they can stomach.\nLuxury condos have been slow movers over the last few years, as the\nmarket slipped\nand money moved to the suburbs and the North Side neighborhoods. Sellers have had to make deep cuts to find buyers,\nsometimes slashing millions\nfrom their asking price and\nselling for less than they paid\nyears ago.\nMany luxury condos still on the market have made similar price chops: The price for a 63rd floor penthouse at\n800 North Michigan Avenue\nhas dropped by $8 million since it was first shopped around privately in 2022. A\n31st-floor condo\nat the Palmolive building has had its asking price reduced by close to $5 million in the five years that it\u2019s been on the market.\nSome sellers resisted lowering their prices over the last few years, hoping the market would recover, said Compass agent Jeff Lowe. But more sellers are starting to cut their expectations and lower their asking prices, and buyers are starting to come to the table.\n\u201cSellers are definitely taking it on the chin, but at least if they\u2019re willing to take it on the chin there are buyers,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cI would say three or four years ago, that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d\nStill, other sellers are often slow to accept the realities of the market and take a loss on their sale.\n\u201cSometimes because the owners paid so much money pre-Covid, they\u2019re having a difficulty taking a loss of a million or two million,\u201d said Chezi Rafaeli, a Coldwell Banker Realty agent who specializes in downtown condos.\nRafaeli has a listing on the 86th floor of Trump Tower at 401 North Wabash Avenue that\u2019s asking $6 million, a $2 million drop from its asking price in 2021. The seller received a recent offer close to the asking price, he said, but they are holding out in the hopes of a market recovery.\nHere\u2019s a rundown of some of the properties that have had the biggest drops in asking price since they were listed.\n800 North Michigan Avenue\nOf the condos currently listed above $4 million downtown, the biggest price drop has been at Bob Levy\u2019s 63rd-floor penthouse at 800 North Michigan Avenue.\nThe former Art Institute of Chicago chair is currently asking nearly $7 million for the Park Tower unit, according to listing services. That\u2019s less than half the original asking price when the condo was first shopped on a private agents\u2019 network for $15 million.\nIt was listed publicly for $13.5 million in July 2022, and by September 2024 the price had been knocked down to $9 million, based on listing data. In January, the asking price dropped to $7.7 million and fell to just under $7 million in July. Levy paid $3.5 million for the penthouse in 2000, according to property records.\nLowe, the listing agent for the condo, said he thinks the current price is attractive. He expects it to sell early next year.\n\u201cWe\u2019re priced to sell there as soon as we find somebody that\u2019s ready for a full floor in that building,\u201d Lowe said.\nCitadel founder Ken Griffin\nfound a buyer this month\nfor his penthouse at the building, with a $12.5 million asking price. The final asking price was more than $3 million less than he first asked for the unit, but a good sign for the market that has rarely seen eight-figure deals in the last three years.\nAlso at 800 North Michigan, listing services show unit 3501 has cut its asking price by $1.35 million, from an initial $5.65 million, since it was listed in January 2024. Its most recent asking price, at $4.3 million, was set in September.\n159 East Walton Place\nTwo for-sale units with the biggest price chops are at the Palmolive Building at 159 East Walton Place. A condo owned by Chicago financier David Herro has been on the market since 2020, when it first asked for $10.9 million, based on listing data. The 5,500-square-foot unit now is asking just under $6 million. That would be a loss for Herro, who bought the condo in 2013 for $6.75 million, property records show.\nAnother condo, owned by former Navteq CEO Judson Green, is asking $4.25 million. It\u2019s a nearly 5,000-square-foot unit on the building\u2019s 18th floor. The current price, set in August, is a 42 percent drop from its initial asking price of $7.35 million in February 2020, according to listing services. Green bought the condo for $6.3 million in 2007, property records show.\nAlso at the building, a duplex covering the top two floors \u2014 once owned by Vince Vaughn \u2014 has had $3 million cut off its asking price from 2021. The 7,900-square-foot penthouse was listed for $11.9 million and is now asking $8.9 million, according to listing services.\nThe Palmolive Building, built in 1929, has been particularly hit by dropping values over the last few years, Rafaeli said. The building lacks the new amenities that luxury buyers are after, and it has seen property taxes rise because of recent special assessments.\n\u201cToday it all comes down to amenities,\u201d he said, \u201cand people are more attracted to amenities versus just living in a condo with a doorman.\u201d\n",

        "content": "In breadth and name, a developer\u2019s early vision for a pair of downtown\nSan Jose\nblocks reflected the ambition and optimism that coursed through the neighborhood just a few years ago.\nProposed in 2021, amid the settling haze of the pandemic,\nUrban Catalyst\u2019s\n\u201cIcon\u201d would feature more than half-a-million square feet of office space, held within a modern-looking 21 stories of glass and steel. Then, in 2023, after the project had already been approved, the developer floated a pivot away from office, suggesting the tower could instead hold 650 housing units.\nDirectly across East Santa Clara Street, the developer\u2019s \u201cEcho\u201d proposal was set to be a multifamily tower of a similar aesthetic, reaching 27 stories with 415 residences.\nDriven in part by a creeping acceptance that not enough workers are returning to the office, that sense of trajectory for Silicon Valley\u2019s central business district has since dwindled. So, too, has the willingness of the capital markets to take ambitious bets on the neighborhood.\nNow, Urban Catalyst\u2019s plans to add to the city skyline have been condensed into a pair of eight-story, mixed-use buildings, according to permit applications filed with the city of San Jose\u2019s planning department last week. The buildings will include 626 units and ground-floor commercial space.\nUrban Catalyst COO Joshua Burroughs blamed the change primarily on macroeconomic factors, from the cost of construction and tariffs, to conservative capital markets. Still, he has maintained a positive tone behind the estimated $300 million housing project, emphasizing that the revamped Icon and Echo will provide downtown San Jose with housing, a crucial element for the resilient, 20-hour neighborhood city leaders are trying to create.\nHowever, some see the contracted vision as a broader recognition of, and perhaps resignation to, the city\u2019s track since the pandemic.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take 600 units downtown, but to go from 20 stories to eight is uninspiring,\u201d a local economic development analyst told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe analyst, who was not authorized to speak publicly, has tracked downtown developments for a decade. Although it\u2019s common for ambitious early renderings to materialize into something more mild, Urban Catalyst has been among the rare local developers to get cranes in the sky, which adds to the \u201cdisheartening\u201d signals sent by the project\u2019s downsizing, he said.\nFifty miles to the north, downtown San Francisco has enjoyed a return of office workers and\nincreased demand for space,\nparticularly high-class, quality offices. While commercial leasing has surged in the broader Silicon Valley, workers have not returned to downtown San Jose at the same pace, one city hall staffer told\nThe Real Deal\n.\n\u201cWe think we\u2019ve peaked in terms of office space,\u201d the staffer, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said. \u201cThe only way we\u2019re going to get more people downtown is by building housing.\u201d\nSome of downtown San Jose\u2019s office ills can be placed on the nature of Silicon Valley, where startups can quickly grow from a garage into multi-million-dollar valuations. Because of that, Burroughs said \u201cone unique thing about Silicon Valley\u201d is that about 90 percent of the office space here is built speculatively, with no specific tenant in mind.\n\u201cStart-ups get funding, and suddenly they need 500,000 square feet of office space in a month, so you need a certain supply of office space sitting there, given the velocity at which these companies grow,\u201d Burroughs said. \u201cThat means you\u2019re speculatively building and needing to find investors who are comfortable with that approach.\u201d\nOne recent example is\nJay Paul Company\u2019s 200 Park\n. The 19-story, 1 million-square-foot development has sat vacant since its completion in 2023.\u201d.\nThen there is Google\u2019s\nstalled gigaproject, Downtown West\n. Approved in 2021, the tech titan envisioned bringing 4,000 homes, 7.3 million square feet of office space, and an estimated economic impact of $19 billion with its new neighborhood. However, the project hasn\u2019t moved since approval.\nLocals see both projects as tea leaves for when downtown San Jose\u2019s office market rises out of its prolonged distress.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not no hope,\u201d the city hall staffer said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t fill 200 Park, and we can\u2019t get the Google project going, then I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see the office market move.\u201d\n",

        "content": "SLS Properties is relaunching the I.M. Pei-designed office building at 2425 West Loop South in Houston, aiming to move past years of turmoil under former owner Ali Choudhri.\nThe vacant 285,00-square-foot 11-story building, formerly home to Stage Stores\u2019 headquarters, became mired in legal and financial distress, including attempted foreclosure and an involuntary bankruptcy tied to Choudhri\u2019s Jetall Companies,\nBisNow reported\n. National Bank of Kuwait, which lent $60.2 million\non the building\nin 2018, remains a creditor in the bankruptcy case, and Choudhri was\nbriefly jailed\nin April for contempt after failing to submit required financial documents.\nAfter acquiring the building through a receivership sale, Houston-based SLS Properties opted to reject all prior leases through bankruptcy proceedings, choosing instead to completely revamp the property.\nSLS Properties founder Danny Sheena said the building was in severe disrepair upon takeover \u2014 only one elevator functioned, the cooling system and roof had failed, garage lighting was outdated and interior floors needed structural attention. SLS has since modernized elevators, replaced mechanical systems and the roof, upgraded lighting and restored interior spaces.\nThe building is now intentionally 100 percent empty and ready for immediate tenant occupancy.\nTranswestern\u2019s Kelli Gault, Jack Scharnberg and Doug Little will handle leasing. Gault emphasized the rarity of such large, contiguous blocks of space in Houston\u2019s Galleria submarket. With expansive floor plates, opportunities for prominent signage and its site directly across from The Galleria Mall, the property could appeal to tenants seeking high visibility.\nIts architectural pedigree also enhances its appeal \u2013 few office buildings can claim the same designer as the Louvre Pyramid in Paris, Gault said.\nSheena said nearby investments could impact the building\u2019s future. It sits next to land purchased by billionaire Tilman Fertitta, who also owns the River Oaks District development across the street and is\nexploring expansion concepts\n. Fertitta recently stepped down as CEO of his holding company to serve as\nU.S. ambassador to Italy\n. The property also neighbors The Greenleigh, a Marriott-affiliated hotel rising from the former Hotel Derek site.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

        "content": "Sonder\u2019s sudden implosion last month\nhas left a trail of vacant buildings and frustrated landlords across Los Angeles.\nOwners who bought properties to be occupied by the defunct short-term rental company are now scrambling to plug holes in their income statements, Bisnow\nreported\n. Those owners now either have to find new operators for their properties or sell them off. That\u2019s easier said than done, as they\u2019ll be harder to backfill than they were three to four years ago, when many property owners signed leases with Sonder, as the hotel market in Los Angeles remains depressed.\n\u201cFrom a buyer standpoint, this is going to be a good opportunity,\u201d Alan Reay, president of Los Angeles-based Atlas Hospitality Group, told Bisnow. \u201cFrom an owner-slash-seller standpoint, it\u2019s going to be extremely difficult.\u201d\nLos Angeles landlords\nthat were operating Sonder locations this year claim in pending lawsuits that Sonder owes them a sum of more than $18.9 million in unpaid rent and other fees, according to court records cited by Bisnow. Similar suits have been filed in New York after Sonder\u2019s abrupt shutdown and subsequent eviction of tenants from their living quarters.\nSonder\n\u2019s high lease rates will be difficult to match for any potential new operators. \u201cFirst and foremost, they\u2019re not going to find anyone to replicate the income that was promised to them by Sonder, which is why Sonder collapsed, right?\u201d Reay said. \u201cIt\u2019s WeWork applied to the hotel industry.\u201d\nFor owners thinking of pivoting out of hospitality, multifamily conversions could be possible, though they might only offer theoretical relief. Sonder units typically lack kitchens, and in Los Angeles, building out residential infrastructure is costly and slow.\nSelling also could be an issue thanks to the\noften reviled Measure ULA\ntransfer tax affecting any deals above $5 million.\n\u201cI have a vacant hotel where the only operating history could be years old, from before Sonder,\u201d Rod Apodaca, president of RJA Hotels, said. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to rely on that, and they\u2019re going to want some type of discount if they\u2019re going to buy a property based on a future income stream that is untested.\u201d\nThe Los Angeles hotel market is struggling as international travelers \u2014 usually a significant portion of L.A.\u2019s hotel guests \u2014 are visiting in lower numbers, per Bisnow. Still,\u00a0 some hotel management companies have started to swoop in on former Sonder properties and offer their operating experience, Reay said.\nSonder remains in the midst of\nChapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings\n, which has stymied the lawsuits it faces from landlords across the country.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Seaport Entertainment Group announced in March that\nMeow Wolf will open\nits seventh permanent exhibition \u2014 first on the East Coast \u2014 on several floors of Pier 17, technically 89 South Street.\nCBRE was the dual leasing agent. Mary Ann Tighe, Gerry Miovski and Evan Haskel represented the landlord, while Cassie Durand, Sacha Zarba and Aylin Gucalp represented the tenant.\nOld Navy | Garment District | 55,000 sq feet\nOld Navy has been on the move. The Gap-owned apparel brand announced its exit from its flagship space at Vornado Realty Trust\u2019s 150 West 34th Street last year, leaving the Herald Square lot open for Primark to swoop in on the biggest lease of 2024. This year, however, Old Navy\ninked a 15-year lease\nat JEMB Realty\u2019s Herald Towers, at 50 West 34th Street.\nGap Inc.\u2019s real estate team and Newmark\u2019s Ariel Schuster represented Old Navy in the deal. JEMB subsidiary LMJ Realty represented the landlord in-house.\nLife Time | Grand Central | 52,000 sq feet\nLife Time signed a 20-year lease\nat PBC\u2019s 10 Bryant Park. The space will include \u201cco-ed wet suite, a steam room, a sauna, a cold-plunge pool, fitness studios, training spaces, spas, a coworking space and a library,\u201d\nTRD\nreported earlier this year.\nAtlantic Retail\u2019s Joe Mastromonaco brokered the deal on behalf of the tenant. JLL brokers Patrick Smith and Paul Glickman represented the landlord.\nEquinox | Chelsea | 50,000 sq feet\nKeeping up with the competition, Equinox, an OG luxury New York gym, signed a long-term lease across\nthree floors of Terminal Warehouse\n, at 261 11th Avenue. It was among the first tenants at the redeveloped 19th-century warehouse, which is being converted to office and retail space by L&amp;L Holding Company and Columbia Property Trust. L&amp;L purchased the 12-story building with a company since acquired by Columbia in 2018 for $880 million.\nNewmark\u2019s Jeff Roseman represented Equinox. A Cushman &amp; Wakefield team including Alan Schmerzler, Catherine Merck and Sean Moran represented the landlord.\nConvene Hospitality | Chelsea | 50,000 sq feet\nAlso in Terminal Warehouse, Convene Hospitality Group\nsigned a deal for 50,000 square feet\nfrom L&amp;L and Columbia. The group is planning to open an event space called The Mallory on the same three floors as Equinox, although in a different section of the historic building.\nCBRE\u2019s Rocco Laginestra represented CHG. The same Cushman &amp; Wakefield team as above,\u00a0 Alan Schmerzler, Catherine Merck and Sean Moran, represented the landlord.\nChelsea Piers | Hudson Square | 48,833 sq feet\nChelsea Piers Management, once a creative re-use of industrial waterfront space, is expanding its profile as a premier fitness location. Expansion is part of this push. In its biggest of two leases signed this year, the company plans to take 48,833 square feet at the base of\nGFP Real Estate\u2019s 200 Varick Street\n. The deal was reported in CBRE\u2019s third-quarter retail report but brokerage details were not disclosed.\nChelsea Piers | Billionaire\u2019s Row | 47,000 sq feet\nChelsea Piers Management\u2019s second-biggest lease of the year was at the ground floor of 135 East 57th Street on Billionaires\u2019 Row. TF Cornerstone, the landlord, is planning to redevelop the 32-story office tower into a 350-unit residential building.\nThe story was\nfirst reported\nby the New York Post and brokerage details were not disclosed.\nOld Navy | Chelsea | 45,000 sq feet\nOld Navy renewed its lease at 610 Sixth Avenue this year, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s first-quarter report. The store there has been open since at least 1997, according to WWD.\nThe building is owned by a trust connected to the family of Sol Goldman, according to city records.\nNeko Health | Upper West Side | 42,151 sq feet\nNeko Health is planning for 42,000 square feet at 15 Central Park West. The lease was disclosed in Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s third-quarter Manhattan retail report. The company, which offers full-body health scans, was started by Spotify co-founder Daniel Ek. 15 Central Park West is a 35-story condo building developed by Arthur and William Lie Zeckendorf.\nNeither Neko Health nor the brokerage team at 15 Central Park West immediately responded to a request for comment.\nAritzia | Soho | 30,000 sq feet\nCanadian clothier Aritzia extended its lease at 560 Broadway, with GFP Real Estate, the Commercial Observer reported. The womenswear company signed its original lease in the former Dean &amp; Deluca\u2019s spot in 2020, initially using it as a pop-up.\nNeith Stone, Donna Vogel and Jeffrey Gural represented GFP in-house, the Observer reported. Ariel Schuster and Jason Wecker brokered the deal for Aritzia.\n",

        "content": "During the height of Miami\u2019s high season, between November and January, folks line up around the block outside Zak the Baker to pick up loaves of freshly baked sourdough bread or to sit down for a cup of coffee.\nBut for the seven other months of the year, on any given weekday, \u201cyou can stand outside and not see a single person walk by for 20 minutes,\u201d Zak Stern, owner of the 11-year-old bakery in\nWynwood\n, told\nThe Real Deal\n.\n\u201cIt can be extremely quiet in the off season,\u201d Stern said. \u201cAnd then we have peaks when we are\u00a0 very busy like during\nArt Basel\nor the holidays. But there\u2019s no consistent, all day flow of people.\u201d\nThe inconsistency in foot traffic fuels Stern\u2019s belief that asking retail rents on Wynwood\u2019s most popular streets, where landlords are seeking $100 or more a square foot, are not justified, and are pricing out homegrown tenants.\n\u201cThe foot traffic needs to be reliable,\u201d Stern said. \u201cThere needs to be morning commuters, lunchtime crowds, afternoon shoppers, early evening diners and weekenders. You can\u2019t [rely on paying] your rent during the peaks. It\u2019s going to take some time, and it\u2019s going to take some work.\u201d\nStern recalled when Wynwood felt like it was on an upward trajectory, with buses of tourists shuttled from Miami Beach and year\u2011over\u2011year momentum for the arts-and-food scene. In his view, that climb stalled because the basics never got built: tree canopy, shade, plazas and calmer streets that make walking appealing in Miami\u2019s heat.\nNewly built mixed-use projects with ground-floor retail spaces sparked a spike in Wynwood\u2019s retail and restaurant rents, but small business owners like Stern say the neighborhood\u2019s uneven, event\u2011driven foot traffic and harsh pedestrian environment make paying triple digits hard to pencil out. Yet, landlords and brokers don\u2019t want to hear it. They argue that surging visitor counts, record condo pricing and limited walkable districts in Miami justify today\u2019s rents.\u200b\nLast year, J. Wakefield Brewing, a craft beer joint that had been in Wynwood for a decade, closed shop. Owner Jonathan Wakefield told\nEater\nat the time that \u201crising rents, coupled with reduced foot traffic and street closures due to construction, made it nearly impossible\u201d to stay in business. Another longtime watering hole casualty of rising rents: Brick, an outdoor venue that opened in 2013, shuttered in November.\nYet, commercial property owners say Wynwood rents are where they\u2019re supposed to be.\n\u201cI think rents are predominantly in line with any other Miami walkable neighborhood,\u201d said\nAlex Karakhanian\n, a landlord for a handful of Wynwood projects. Wynwood gets 6 to 9 million visitors a year, he said. \u201cYou\u2019re getting a ton of people from all over the place coming to Wynwood \u2026 I go to Zak the Baker at least once a week, and I\u2019ve never gotten a table without having to wait on a normal work day.\u201d\nFrom $20 to $100 a foot in a decade\nStern\u2019s bakery is insulated by a legacy lease that\u2019s below the $100 per-square-foot mark, which is the only reason his business can still operate in Wynwood\u2019s current market conditions, he said. Over the past 10 years, pricing for neighboring storefronts shot up from the $20s a square foot to $100\u2011plus per square foot on prime blocks, Stern said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve still got another seven, eight years left [on the lease],\u201d Stern said. \u201cBut in order for an independent, local craftsman like myself to succeed, [landlords are] going to need to be much more reasonable than $100 a square foot. It\u2019s just that the barrier to entry is too tall.\u201d\nThe\nWynwood\nretail market, including less desirable streets, is more expensive than the overall Miami retail market, data show. Between 2023 and 2025, the average asking rent for retail and restaurants is between the high $60s to low $80s per square foot compared to low-to-mid $50s per square foot citywide, according to CoStar.\nVacancies are rising.\nIn the third quarter, the vacancy rate in the Wynwood/Design District submarket hit 9.7 percent compared to 3.2 percent for Miami-Dade County overall, according to a Colliers report. During the same period last year, Miami-Dade\u2019s vacancy rate was 2.8 percent compared to 6.5 percent for the Wynwood/Design District submarket.\nMetro 1\u2019s Andres Nava agreed that certain Wynwood corridors have blasted past $100 a square foot, but stressed \u201cthat\u2019s not the entire neighborhood.\u201d For instance, a fitness tenant typically tops out at about $70 to $80 per square foot, triple\u2011net, for a roughly 2,000\u2011square\u2011foot space. Food and beverage operators, depending on whether they can serve liquor, tend to land in the $60- to $70\u2011per\u2011square\u2011foot range, Nava said.\n\u201cFoot traffic is obviously mostly on Northwest Second Avenue and Northwest Third Avenue,\u201d Nava said. \u201cThose are the two main pedestrian corridors. When you start going to the residential projects that don\u2019t attract as much foot traffic, you see rents that are more sustainable.\u201d\nSome developers recognize this reality, Nava said. For instance, he recently brokered leases for Hot Body Pilates and coffee bar Chrome Cafe at Amara Wynwood, a mixed-use project at 45 Northeast 27th Street developed by Chicago-based\nFitfield Companies\n.\n\u201cThe rents need to be a lot more palatable and attainable to create a sustainable future for Wynwood,\u201d Nava said. \u201cSome developers like Fitfield will be more lenient on reducing the rent to get the right operators in the neighborhood.\u201d\nThe foot traffic flipside\nWhen Wynwood\u2019s early pioneers were buying warehouses to redevelop a decade ago, the neighborhood was drawing fewer than 50,000 visitors a year, Karakhanian said. In his view, the same way rents were $15 to $20 per square foot back when there was \u201cno foot traffic,\u201d the combination of millions of visitors and a limited supply of walkable streets now supports today\u2019s rent growth.\nKarakhanian noted that some Wynwood retailers, restaurateurs and bar owners are racking up north of $10 million in annual sales.\n\u201cRecently, one of our tenants bought the space they were leasing for $140 a square foot, triple net. They did the math on their expenses and decided to purchase the space for close to $2,800 a square foot,\u201d he said.\nKarakhanian\u2019s Miami-based Lndmrk Development, Scott Sherman\u2019s Miami-based Torose Equities and Michael Simkins\u2019 Miami Beach-based Lion Development Group sold a retail condo at\nSociety Wynwood\nfor $3.7 million to the owners of I Scream Gelato. When the sale closed, he was approached by other tenants throughout Lndmrk\u2019s Wynwood portfolio about possibly buying their spaces, Karakhanian said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not a one-off scenario,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a tenant is approaching you to buy their space, it is very hard for me to believe that a tenant is doing poorly.\u201d\nSome leasing brokers say the foot traffic in Wynwood makes it a better value than other walkable commercial districts in Miami. The neighborhood has \u201c10 times\u201d the foot traffic than Brickell, Coconut Grove, the Design District, Miami Beach\u2019s Lincoln Road and Giralda Avenue in Gables, Tony Arellano with Dwntwn Realty Advisors told\nTRD\n.\nAverage asking rents in Coconut Grove are 10 to 15 percent higher, 30 percent higher in Lincoln Road and five times more in the Design District compared to Wynwood, Arellano added.\n\u201cWhoever claims that Wynwood rents don\u2019t match the foot traffic, let\u2019s do the comparison,\u201d Arellano said. \u201cYou\u2019ll find Wynwood is still a very good value.\u201d\nThe view from the ground\nOn the ground, however, even successful operators are hitting a wall. Gramps, one of Wynwood\u2019s early and best\u2011known bars, is closing in January after more than a decade in the neighborhood. Pizza Tropical, an Italian pie joint within Gramps, shut down this week. Owner\nAdam Gersten\ntold\nTRD\n\u201cit\u2019s not just the rent.\u201d But his decision also reflects seven days a week of wear and tear, mounting repair bills and the cost of upgrading a space that has seen heavy use.\n\u201cHaving to pay a little more [rent] is not the end of the world because, thankfully, people still go there,\u201d Gersten said. \u201cWe got all these people moving into the neighborhood. But they\u2019re Ubering to one place, staying there and then leaving. They\u2019re not necessarily bar hopping.\u201d\nGersten traces part of the pressure to landlords who acquired buildings at aggressive prices and now must start rent at $75 a square foot, then layer on passthrough expenses such as maintenance and property taxes.\n\u201cI used to think paying $40 square foot in rent was a good number because you can make money,\u201d Gersten said. \u201cWith triple net, today you\u2019re looking at paying in the $80s, $90s and $100s.\u00a0 When you have a sizable space that needs to make money, you are just churning tenants.\u201d\nFor Stern, developers and brokers who insist Wynwood\u2019s foot traffic is doing well are refusing to see reality.\n\u201cI think they\u2019re dreaming,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re comparing it to some of these peaks that we have, sure. But [to achieve] that every day, all day consistency, we\u2019ve got to remain humble and honest about who we are.\u201d",

        "content": "Blackstone locked in a ten-figure loan to refinance its largest rental property in New York City.\nWells Fargo provided $3.15 billion in debt to refinance Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. A $3 billion debt from Fannie Mae backing Manhattan\u2019s largest apartment complex was nearing maturity.\nSince purchasing the complex alongside a Canadian pension fund for $5.5 billion in 2015, Blackstone has invested $460 million into the property. That includes renovations, expansions and the installation of 9,600 solar panels. Blackstone also added a Whole Foods and a restaurant to the retail portfolio.\nNotably, all of the units in Stuy Town are rent-stabilized. At the time of its acquisition, Stephen Schwarzman\u2019s firm planned to lift more than half of the complex\u2019s 11,200 apartments out of stabilization in a deal brokered by the city.\nStuy Town\u2019s apartments were slated to become unstabilized by June 2020, but tenants sued Blackstone under the protections afforded to them by changes made to the rent laws the prior year.\nIn early 2023, a state court judge\nruled in favor of the complex\u2019s tenants\n, saying the changes in the rent law meant Blackstone couldn\u2019t deregulate roughly 6,200 apartments in a decision with major\nimplications\nfor other properties that received J-51 tax benefits.\nBlackstone appealed the ruling, but ultimately\nended its attempts\nto challenge a decision on the status of the portfolio last winter.\nBlackstone has been busy in the Big Apple lately. Last week, a joint venture between TPG and Acadia Realty Trust agreed to purchase The Shops at Skyview in Flushing from Blackstone for\nroughly $425 million\n. The shopping center at 40-24 College Point Boulevard is anchored by a grocery store, spans 550,000 square feet and is almost fully leased.\nOutside of city limits, Blackstone is nearing the acquisition of the 277-room Four Seasons hotel in downtown San Francisco for\napproximately $130 million\n.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner",

        "content": "The legal battle between the University of California, Los Angeles, the City of Pasadena and the Rose Bowl Operating Company continues as the school mulls potentially abandoning its lease to play football at the\nRose Bowl\n. The school is\nreportedly\nlooking to decamp to SoFi Stadium in Inglewood to take advantage of its proximity to the university campus as well as increased revenue generation opportunities with more premium seating and luxury suites.\nNeither the Rose Bowl Operating Company nor the City of Pasadena violated the Rose Bowl\u2019s long-term lease agreement before the university began considering a move to SoFi Stadium earlier this year, Pasadena Now\nreported\n, citing a new document filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court.\nUCLA\n\u2019s lease states that the school can abandon its agreement early only in the case of a \u201cgame-threatening default,\u201d or an immediate issue that would keep the team from playing at the stadium, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n. Under its current lease, the UCLA Bruins cannot play its home football games in another stadium in Los Angeles or Orange Counties through June 2044,\naccording\nto the New York Times.\nThe\nCity of Pasadena\nand Rose Bowl Operating Company filed its lawsuit against UCLA in October, adding SoFi Stadium and SoFi site owner\nKroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment\n\u2014 to the lawsuit last month. The plaintiffs sued the Regents of the University of California to compel UCLA to honor its contract.\nA breach notice from UCLA as required under its contract could have given the City of Pasadena a chance to address any alleged deficiencies or operational concerns. The latest legal document filed describes UCLA\u2019s purported intentions dating back to early this year and claims that the university never alleged any contractual default by the City or Rose Bowl.\n\u201cAt no time has UCLA ever asserted that any \u2018game-threatening default\u2019 exists [or any default by the RBOC or the City for that matter] under the agreement or otherwise,\u201d Jens Weiden, general manager of the Rose Bowl, says in the documents, per Pasadena Now.\nThe lack of a breach claim is notable because UCLA representatives were reportedly involved in private discussions in late 2024 and early 2025, Weiden says, claiming that he became aware from multiple credible sources that UCLA was looking into an \u201cimminent relocation\u201d to SoFi Stadium. Soon thereafter, reports from UCLA athletics personnel indicated that the university was in talks with SoFi Stadium executives, including Kevin Demoff, president of Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment, over revenue-sharing models among other topics.\nAt the same time, the suit says, UCLA continued with business as usual in its planning with the Rose Bowl as if their long-term agreement wasn\u2019t going anywhere. UCLA purportedly led the Rose Bowl on as they discussed field renovations and design work for premium seating, suggesting to the city and the Rose Bowl Operating Company that UCLA would honor its lease and stay in the historic sports venue.\nPart of the lease includes a dispute-resolution clause that allows a judge to pick a neutral third party during the dispute process. UCLA has filed a motion to compel the two sides to enter arbitration, but the city has yet to agree to enter into the dispute-resolution process.\nAs for whether UCLA is actually moving its football games to SoFi Stadium, the university said nothing is set in stone yet.\n\u201cNo decision has been made,\u201d the school said, per the New York Times.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The Archdiocese of New York is cashing in one of its crown-jewel sites as it scrambles to cover mounting payouts to survivors of clergy sexual abuse.\nCardinal Timothy Dolan told parishioners this week that the Church would keep liquidating real estate to fill a widening financial hole tied to settlements, according to the\nCommercial Observer\n. The latest move is a big one: selling the ground lease under the Lotte New York Palace for $490 million to the luxury hotel operator.\nLotte already owns the building but has long leased the ground.\nRoughly $200 million of the proceeds will go toward the next disbursement under the Church\u2019s Independent Reconciliation and Compensation Program, launched in 2016. The remaining $290 million is earmarked to repay loans the Archdiocese took out to fund earlier IRCP agreements and claims filed under the state\u2019s Child Victims Act.\nA spokesperson said the deal is part of a broader global settlement effort brokered with the help of a mediator.\nFor Lotte, the transaction is a chance to lock up full control of one of Manhattan\u2019s highest-profile hospitality assets. The Korean conglomerate\nbought the 55-story Palace\nin 2015.\nA spokesperson called the land buy a \u201cpivotal milestone\u201d for the brand, which still needs sign-off from the New York State Supreme Court before closing.\nThe sale is the latest in a two-year sell-down of the Church\u2019s Manhattan holdings.\nIn July, it unloaded its longtime headquarters at 1011 First Avenue to Vanbarton Group for $103 million; Vanbarton plans to\nconvert\nthe office tower to residential. An Archdiocese spokesperson said the 1011 First Avenue proceeds could also be routed toward the global settlement as the Church continues to mine its portfolio to meet obligations.\nEarlier this year, the Archdiocese sold three buildings on West 25th Street in Chelsea\nfor $48 million\nand in 2024, it shed a vacant East Village lot for up to $68 million to a team planning 570 units of housing.\nThose deals followed a late-2023 air-rights transaction in which Ken Griffin, Vornado and Rudin agreed to pay as much as $164 million for 525,000 square feet above St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The price represents a decline from the $84.3 million purchase price seller Sedco Capital, a Saudi Arabia\u2013based investment manager, paid in 2019.\nThe deal adds to a rebound of activity in Chicago\u2019s\nindustrial market\n. Investors have deployed $4 billion into the sector over the past 12 months, a 15 percent increase, year-over-year, based on CoStar data.\nThe facility is a mission\u2011critical hub for FedEx because of its strategic location one mile from I-94 and eight miles from O\u2019Hare International Airport.\nMemphis, Tennessee-based FedEx has occupied the property since its completion in 2015, and JLL noted that more than 11 acres of excess land on the site offer future development potential.\nKurt Sarbaugh, one of the JLL executives who brokered the deal, said \u201cIt is incredibly difficult to assemble a site in North Cook County large enough to accommodate a facility of this size with all of the additional car and trailer parking space required for an operation like this.\u201d\nThe buyers have longstanding Blackstone lineage. Centaur Capital Partners, based in Lake Forest, serves as the family office of John Schreiber, co-founder of Blackstone Real Estate Advisors. Schreiber recently invested roughly $180 million in Chicago multifamily projects, including the Parker Fulton Market\ntower\nand\nCobbler Square Lofts\n, in partnership with JDL Development.\nTalos Capital, based in Westchester, Illinois and led by Brian Townsend, previously served as Blackstone\u2019s industrial investment arm beginning in 2017 and prior to the creation of Link Logistics in 2019.\nThe company served as lender on the failed HFZ\ncondo project\nin Chicago. Townsend also partnered with Centaur in 2018 to assemble a 5 million\u2011square\u2011foot industrial portfolio across Chicago, Milwaukee, Minneapolis and El Paso, Texas.\nThe seller of the Niles property, Sedco Capital, traces its origins to the Saudi Economic Development Company, founded in 1976. It evolved into a family office for the Bin Mahfouz family in 1996 and later expanded into a multi\u2011investor firm in 2009.\nJLL\u2019s Sarbaugh, Sean Devaney and John Huguenard represented the seller in the deal.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

        "content": "Embattled Sonoma developer\nKen Mattson\ncontinues to face the prospect of losing his properties as part of his ongoing legal troubles.\nA court hearing on the terms of Mattson\u2019s bail on Wednesday centered around a disputed piece of collateral: a home at 210 La Salle Avenue in\nPiedmont\nowned by his wife Stacy that helped secure his $4 million bail package, the Press Democrat\nreported\n. The magistrate judge, Alex G. Tse, sided with prosecutors and ordered the deed to the house into bond.\nIn July, Mattson\u2019s legal team\nasked the court\nto allow him to sell two of his properties \u2014 including the one in Piedmont \u2014 in order to fund his legal bills. Assistant U.S. Attorney Nikhil Bhagat argued that the home was viable to be included as bail, while Mattson\u2019s criminal defense attorney said it wasn\u2019t because a foreclosure order is set to take effect Dec. 30. Mattson\u2019s lawyers said he should be able to sell the Piedmont home as part of his 6th Amendment rights.\nThe criminal defense attorney, Randy Sue Pollock, asked Tse, the judge overseeing Mattson\u2019s bail agreement, to wait until the trial judge\nruled on related issues as part of the handling of the majority of the government\u2019s case against Mattson. Tse rejected the appeal. Pollock agreed to hand over the deed to the Piedmont house by the end of the day on Friday, placing the estate with equity valued at $2 million into Mattson\u2019s bond package.\nBhagat confirmed the house is to secure Mattson\u2019s appearance at trial, as he was deemed a flight risk earlier this year, and that the money wouldn\u2019t go toward restitution for his victims. If the property ends up being sold out of foreclosure, the home\u2019s equity will go to the court clerk. Creditors for the home, valued at more than $6 million, sought to wrest control of the property by any means necessary, including eviction, the Press Democrat previously\nreported\n.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we finally have that lien,\u201d Risa Meyer, who invested her money with Mattson, told the Press Democrat after the hearing. \u201cIt has been a bone of contention, and a point of fear. People have been afraid that [Mattson] would be able to remain free without ever posting bail.\u201d\nMattson was\narrested and indicted in May\non nine felony counts including wire fraud, money laundering and obstruction of justice. The Sonoma developer, who currently lives in San Francisco, stands accused by prosecutors of running a Ponzi scheme that took at least $46 million from potentially hundreds of investor clients over a period of at least 15 years.\nMattson allegedly offered and sold fake ownership interests to investors, promising legitimate investments in commercial and residential real estate. As he amassed his fortune throughout that time, he purchased more than two dozen properties in the Sonoma region worth $80 million, the Press Democrat\nreported\n. He was released on $4 million bond in late May.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Outdoors will be grilling stations, a catering kitchen and a bar.\nAdditional lifestyle amenities will include a pet spa, a dog run and park, a card room, a children\u2019s activity center, a gaming lounge, a media room, a theater and an event space.

        "content": "Attorney General Ken Paxton and the Texas State Securities Board are at odds over a lawsuit Paxton filed targeting a large Muslim\u2011centric residential development in the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth market, formerly known as Epic City and\nnow called\nThe Meadow.\nThe project, led by the East Plano Islamic Center and Community Capital Partners, would build more than 1,000 homes, a mosque, a K\u201112 faith\u2011based school, senior living facilities, apartments, clinics, retail, a community college and sports fields across 402 acres in Collin and Hunt counties,\nThe Dallas Morning News\nreported.\nThe lawsuit alleges that Community Capital Partners, led by\nImran Chaudhary\n, and affiliated entities engaged in an illegal development scheme by selling unregistered securities in violation of the Texas Securities Act.\nAccording to the attorney general, investors were required to purchase an $80,000 limited partnership share in CCP to reserve a lot, and the group failed to properly register these offerings or verify that buyers qualified as accredited investors under SEC Regulation D. Paxton argues that CCP should not qualify for exemptions typically available for private offerings.\nHowever, the Texas State Securities Board publicly contradicted Paxton\u2019s claims. After conducting a months\u2011long investigation, the agency concluded that the limited partnership interests did not constitute securities under Texas law, even though they were marketed to investors in a manner resembling investment contracts.\nThe agency did not explain its reasoning, but stated that it had informed Paxton\u2019s office of its findings before the lawsuit was filed. It also advised that any potential claims might be more viable under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act rather than securities law.\nCommunity Capital Partners said in a statement that \u201cThe fact that multiple reviews were completed, and that these findings were known before litigation was filed, raises serious and unavoidable questions about why this matter is now being framed as a securities case, and why this project continues to be targeted despite repeated reviews finding no securities violations.\u201d\nSam Edwards, a Texas-based fraud and securities attorney, said he\u2019s not sure how the state board determined the investments didn\u2019t qualify as securities because \u201cthe Texas Securities Act specifically lists certain investments that are considered a security, and the first one listed is a limited partner interest.\u201d On the other hand, the agency \u201cis the authority on securities in this state,\u201d he added.\nGov. Greg Abbott has separately directed state agencies to investigate The Meadow and signed a transparency law\nrelated to the project\n. Some inquiries have already been resolved, including a Fair Housing Act\ncomplaint\nand a federal civil rights probe, while others remain ongoing.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

Hochman asserted that unlicensed contractors might promise to rebuild burned homes faster and cheaper, but in hiring them, homeowners could face faulty workmanship, liability for worker injuries and sometimes even theft.\n\u201cThis increases the likelihood of fraud,\u201d Hochman said in a news conference after the charges were filed. \u201cYou\u2019re going to give them a whole bunch of money upfront, and you may never see them again.\u201d\nFour separate complaints from the district attorney allege that Daniel Escarzaga, Andrew Escarzaga, Edgar Geovanni Lopez Revolorio, Melvin Hairon Mejia Ordonez and Guillermo Ramirez were contracting without licenses during a natural disaster \u2014 a felony violation of California\u2019s business and professions code. Hochman said an investigation found that the men knew they were operating without a license but offered their services to fire victims anyway.\n\u201cGet the heck out of our community, unlicensed contractors,\u201d Hochman said,\nper\nNBC Los Angeles. \u201cThese folks are not insured\u2026 If something goes wrong during this construction process and you want to go after their insurance, they have no insurance to go after.\u201d\nL.A. County Supervisor Kathryn Barger, who represents Altadena, urged homeowners to use vetted lists of licensed contractors as they plan their\nrebuilding efforts\n. \u201cHiring unlicensed contractors often ends up costing more in the long run,\u201d she said.\nDuring a wildfire state of emergency, unlicensed contractors and contractor fraud could result in three years in prison or a $10,000 fine, according to Hochman. The five men are expected to be arraigned in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Jan. 8.\nJan. 7 marks one year since the deadly Eaton and Palisades fires ripped across both eastern and western portions of Los Angeles County. Unincorporated portions of the county, which include Altadena, have had 990 building permits issued,\naccording\nto the state\u2019s permitting progress dashboard, while the City of Pasadena has issued 15 so far. The City of Los Angeles, which includes the Pacific Palisades, has handed out 1,222 rebuild permits, and the neighboring\nCity of Malibu has issued\n20.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The stack features Low-Income Housing Tax Credit financing, as well as an additional $120 million in debt and preferred equity from a pair of unnamed institutional lenders.\nA Walker &amp; Dunlop team including Aaron Appel, Keith Kurland and Jonathan Schwartz arranged the financing.\nThe debt is going to a joint venture of SK Development and the Berger Organization, which is leading the charge at 22 Fulton.

The development will also include 4,700 square feet of retail space.\nConstruction is expected to begin in the coming months and close by the end of 2028.\nSK Development has kept busy this year.

Other ongoing projects include the Firemen\u2019s Building Apartments.\nThis is the second time in a couple of weeks Goldman Sachs\u2019 Urban Investment Group has financed a large project in New Jersey.\nGoldman Sachs also provided\nthe $200 million financing\nfor a 34-story development spearheaded by Lions Group NYC at 701 Newark Avenue in Jersey City\u2019s Journal Square neighborhood.

The study concluded that the system has become opaque, fragmented and overly reliant on specialized attorneys, with a cumbersome approval process involving multiple public bodies, high fees and timelines that can stretch up to three years.\nIn 2022, more than 90 municipalities in the county granted business tax breaks that removed $7.58 billion in assessed value from the tax rolls, shifting $343 million in tax burden onto\nother property owners\n. Local officials defend the incentives as essential to retain employers, attract industrial investment and compete with lower\u2011tax jurisdictions such as adjacent Will County and Indiana, according to the report.\nThe report highlights structural weaknesses such as incomplete records, inconsistent municipal reporting and the suspension of triennial affidavits during the pandemic. Incentives cover new industrial development, commercial projects, grocery stores in food deserts, brownfield redevelopment and Class 8 incentives in designated townships, but are granted largely by right, with little scrutiny of whether businesses truly need them, according to the study.\nFor example, industrial areas near the county\u2019s borders rely heavily on incentives to prevent tenant flight, yet without better data, it remains unclear whether these incentives change business behavior or simply shift or\nreduce tax revenue\n.\nThe report recommends 30 reforms, including negotiated incentive agreements, performance\u2011based standards, streamlined applications and improved data collection. A similar\nstudy in 2024\nalso suggested systemic reforms.\nPreckwinkle aims to use these changes to create a more equitable, targeted system that\nsupports disinvested suburbs\nwhile reducing unnecessary giveaways.\nBecause Cook County can reform incentives without state approval, officials see this as a rare opportunity to modernize economic development policy and strengthen commercial investment, according to the Tribune.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

Of the 145 homes, 19 of them will be for households making 60 percent of the area median income. In Santa Clara County, that\namounts\nto $81,960 for one person or $117,120 for a household of four.\nThe site is owned by ARE San Francisco No. 69 LLC, an entity managed by Pasadena-based\nAlexandria Real Estate Equities\n. Alexandria bought the Geng Road property, located between Highway 101 and the Baylands Athletic Center, from Hudson Pacific Properties in 2018 for $136 million.\nFlexible office provider Regus occupies one of the buildings at 2100-2400 Geng Road. Other tenants include Workday Adaptive Planning, Contemporary Technology University and software company Actian Corporation.\nThe project is the latest case of Strada betting on residential instead of offices amid a slumping office market across the Bay Area.\nAt\nanother Alexandria-owned site\n, Strada has proposed building 1,500 units across two towers at 88 Bluxome Street in San Francisco\u2019s South of Market district, becoming the first firm to take advantage of new regulations allowing large-scale development projects in Central SoMa to shift from commercial to residential use. Alexandria Real Estate and\nTMG Partners\nwere previously entitled to deliver a 1.1-million-square-foot mixed-use development including 775,000 square feet of offices. Strada\u2019s plans for the 2.6-acre site call for 785 units in one 599-foot tower and 715 units in a smaller 528-foot building.\nIn July, the company received approval from the San Francisco Port Commission to modify its proposal to build housing and office space on the Embarcadero. The developer will be allowed to build 618 units of\nhousing at Seawall Lot 330\n, currently a parking lot, while pausing to reevaluate the construction of a 375,000-square-foot office building on a 13-acre site at Piers 30 through 32 across the street. That office development will be placed on hold until at least early 2027.

Similar sales include entertainment agent\nGary Osier\u2019s 10,300-square-foot contemporary mansion in Old Preston Hollow\n, which took a 5 percent price cut before selling with an $11.7 million asking price;\nentrepreneur Mark Haidar\u2019s White Rock Lake estate\n, which gradually cut its asking price by $5 million before selling at $10.9 million; and\nMehrdad Moayedi\u2019s spec project at 10006 Hollow Way Road\n, which sold at its original $15.9 million listing price.\n",

        "content": "The Chraibi brothers scored rezoning approval this week for a complex with 224 townhomes in Miami Gardens.\nBluenest Development\n, led by Salim and Kamil Chraibi, is under contract to buy the 21-acre site for about $14 million, with the deal expected to close by year\u2019s end, according to sources familiar with the matter.\nThe Chraibis declined to comment on the price for the land at 20700 Northwest 42nd Avenue. Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s Scott O\u2019Donnell, who marketed the site on behalf of the seller, an affiliate of media company iHeart Media, also declined to disclose the price.\nThe majority of homes will be sold at market-rate rents, a deviation from Bluenest\u2019s traditional focus on developing workforce housing. The project will have some workforce townhomes for city employees, though the exact number is yet to be determined, Salim and Kamil Chraibi said.\nBluenest generally caps prices for its workforce homes at $451,000.\nDesigned by Pascual, Perez, Kiliddjian, Starr &amp; Associates, the complex will consist of primarily three-bedroom townhomes averaging at about 1,900 square feet, though Bluenest is considering including some four-bedroom homes spanning from 2,000 square feet to 2,200 square feet, according to the Chraibis.\nThe complex would have six buildings with three townhomes, 13 buildings with four townhomes, 20 buildings with five townhomes and nine buildings with six townhomes.\nThe project still needs site plan approval, which will be done administratively, Kamil Chraibi said.\nConstruction is expected to start in the summer or fall of next year and be completed by the end of 2028, the brothers said.\nSalim founded Bluenest in 2018, and younger brother Kamil joined about a year later. The firm has become a powerhouse in workforce housing development in\nsouth Miami-Dade\n.\nThe brothers started out building individual homes across the county and carved out their niche by seizing on South Florida\u2019s\naffordability crisi\ns and plentiful land supply in the\nsouth county area\n, the last frontier for housing construction in otherwise land-constrained Miami-Dade.\nBluenest\nhas completed 1,000 homes and has roughly 3,000 in various stages of approval and development, the Chraibis have said. The majority of homes are in South Dade, where Bluenest is one of the largest non-institutional workforce housing developers.\nIts planned projects include the 90-acre Krome, with roughly 500 townhomes and 76 large single-family homes lining the perimeter of the property and about 10 acres of commercial space, including a grocery store, in south Miami-Dade. Also in south Dade, Bluenest plans K Legacy with 57 townhomes on a 4-acre lot in Princeton.\nMiami Gardens, a city in northwest Miami-Dade, has caught developers\u2019 eyes in recent years. Cymbal DLT, led by Asi Cymbal and Hector Torres, completed the 341-unit\nLaguna Gardens\napartment complex last year at 20775 Northwest 17th Avenue. It retroactively converted it to workforce rentals, allowing it to tap into the\nLive Local Act\u2019s tax breaks\nfor below-market rentals.\nFlorida Memorial University, a historically Black university, and Redwood Dev Co have partnered on a 52.6-acre project in Miami Gardens, with the\n$500 million-plus\nfirst phase consisting of a pair of eight-story buildings with 500 student beds, 500 workforce units, and basketball courts, a turf field and academic facilities.\n",

        "content": "Miami commissioners granted two developers free land and up to $8 million in forgivable city loans for the construction of affordable and workforce housing rental projects in\nLittle Havana\n.\nThe vote in favor of the sweeteners came amid rising criticism against the city and other South Florida governments for catering to developers by awarding them perks, including land for allegedly below-market rate prices.\nPublic officials have countered that some of these carrots are a way to incentivize the construction of affordable and workforce rentals, a housing type that\u2019s acutely needed in South Florida, where many residents are\ncost burdened\n.\nIn the Little Havana deals, Miami will transfer the half-acre-plus site at 1340 Southwest Eighth Street and 825 Southwest 13th Court to N.R. Investments, which plans an 11-story mixed-income building with about 114 apartments under the\nLive Local Act\n.\nThe city also will transfer a 0.6-acre site at 1251 Southwest Seventh Street to Mabruk USA, which wants to build a 12-story building with 105 units, according to documents attached to the commission agenda. Miami will grant up to $4 million in loans to each developer.\nCity commissioners approved the land transfers and loans at their meeting on Thursday without discussion.\nThe loan to N.R. Investments will come from the city\u2019s District 3 capital reserve and affordable housing public benefits fund, and affordable housing and/or rental assistance program funds tapped from the city\u2019s MiamiCoin cryptocurrency\u200b, the agenda documents say. (Miami\u2019s District 3 includes Little Havana.)\nMabruk USA\u2019s loan will come from the HOME Investment Partnership Funds, which are allocated from the federal government.\nFor N.R. Investments\u2019 project, the city will purchase the development site for $5.9 million and transfer it to the developer, according to the South Florida Business Journal.\nThe lot at 1340 Southwest Eighth Street, home to a retail plaza, is owned by Lopez Optical; and the one at 825 Southwest 13th Court, home to a two-story office building, is owned by Ray Optical, records show.\nMiami-based\nN.R. Investments\n\u2013\u2013 led by Ron Gottesmann and\nNir Shoshani\n\u2013\u2013 proposes about 41 studios, 52 one-bedroom apartments and 21 two-bedroom apartments, about 7,000 square feet of ground-floor retail and a three-story, 90-space garage, the firm told the city in an October letter.\nAbout 80 of the apartments will be at below-market rents, designated for households earning 60, 100 and 120 percent of the area median income.\nMiami-Dade\u2019s annual AMI is $87,200, according to the Florida Housing Finance Corporation, though it\u2019s expected to be updated in the spring.\nMiami owns the vacant development site it plans to transfer to Mabruk USA. The firm, led by Nuri Dorra and Dr. Ingrid E. Dorra of North Miami Beach, proposes a project with 30 one-bedroom apartments and 75 two-bedroom apartments, ground-floor retail and a four-story garage, agenda documents show.\nAll units in the building will be at below-market rents, targeting households earning up to 80 percent of the AMI.\nThe city\u2019s approval comes with a caveat that if the developers fail to build, the properties will revert back to the city.\nThose items sailed through at the Thursday commission meeting, but a Watson Island deal was the subject of criticism.\nThe city\napproved the sale\nof 3.2 acres on Watson Island to BH3 and Merrimac Ventures for $29 million. At issue: An appraisal determined the land could be worth between $257 million and $342 million, according to the Miami Herald.\nMiami-Dade County has a\nrecord\nof giving away land it deems as \u201csurplus\u201d for below-market value in no-bid sales or leases to developers. The deals are sanctioned under a county rule that allows a commissioner to back a developer\u2019s proposal as long as the project is planned for a site the county has deemed as underutilized.\n",

Prudential Financial issued a $42.9 million acquisition loan to Space Investment for the purchase, and Eastdil Secured brokered the transaction on behalf of both parties.\nTopanga Gateway\u2019s location, high occupancy rate and tenant sales performance at the shopping center were factors in Space Investment\u2019s move to buy the development, firm co-founder Ryan Gallagher told Commercial Property Executive. It was 97 percent occupied at the time of sale with occupants like Ralphs, The Container Store and Petco as well as anchor tenant Sprouts Farmers Market. The mall, consisting of four single-story buildings on an 8-acre site, completed a renovation last year.\nIn July, Space Investment\nbought the Fullerton Metrocenter\nmall in Fullerton for $118.5 million. Seller Kite Realty Group bought the 395,703-square-foot retail property in 2021 for $103 million. A month prior, Space Investment trimmed its Orange County portfolio with the sale of the 39,300-square-foot Westport Plaza &amp; Square in Costa Mesa to Asana Partners for $25.7 million, up from the\n$18.4 million\nSpace Investment acquired it for in 2019.\nInvestor confidence in local retail\nis growing.\nIn the first 11 months of the year, the Los Angeles regional retail market saw nearly $1.5 billion in investment sales of 52 assets. Investment volume in the area in the same period in 2024 amounted to $816 million for 44 properties.

        "content": "A deal between two Chicago-based firms likely marks the first large-scale multifamily sale under the city\u2019s new\ncontroversial right of first refusal ordinance\n.\nCRG sold the 134-unit AM1980 Apartments in Logan Square to CedarSt this week in a transaction that CRG\u2019s Tom Shanabruch called a \u201cfrustrating process,\u201d due to Chicago\u2019s new set of constraints on sales under the Northwest Side Housing Preservation Ordinance.\n\u201cBeing the guinea pig in the process for this large-scale sale was interesting and sometimes a frustrating process, but we got through it,\u201d said Shanabruch, CRG\u2019s vice president of investments and capital markets.\nThough he declined to disclose a sale price, it likely fell between $30 million to $40 million because a prior sale of the property that ultimately fell through was set to close at $38 million.\nThe purchase was an opportunity to \u201cacquire one of Chicago\u2019s top multifamily assets in a supply-constrained market,\u201d CedarSt CEO Will Murphy said in a press statement.\nCedarSt is rebranding the property as The Weyland.\nThe Northwest Side Housing Preservation Ordinance, passed by the city council in late 2024, created a pilot area in parts of Logan Square, Avondale, Hermosa, Humboldt Park, West Town and Pilsen. In it, tenants are given the right of first refusal if a landlord sells a building, and existing demolition fees are increased for developers seeking to replace multiunit buildings with single-family homes.\nThe program was designed to protect tenants in gentrifying areas, especially neighborhoods like Bucktown or Logan Square. The area lost 6 percent of its two-flat to six-flat buildings between 2013 and 2018, according to the DePaul Institute for Housing Studies.\nBut after an\noutcry from longtime property owners\n, the city council later\nvoted to remove\nparts of the 31st and 36th wards from the pilot area.\nThe AM1980 Apartments, at 1980 North Milwaukee Avenue, were still subject to the new regulations.\nCRG developed the 7-story building with ground floor retail with the help of a construction loan of more than $23 million from Iowa-based Principal Life Insurance, originated in 2017, public records show. CRG retired the construction debt in 2021, replacing it with a new $24 million mortgage loan, also from Principal.\nThe firm signed off on maturity date extensions with the lender twice in the years since then, first to buy another year until April 2025, and again a few months ago to push the due date to April 2026, public records show.\nBut offloading the property was not a simple process. CRG listed it before the right of first refusal ordinance passed, but did not close a deal before it took effect.\nTo get the deal with CedarSt across the finish line, Shanabruch said CRG worked with attorney Kate Duncan at Quarles &amp; Brady to ensure the sale process complied with city regulations. Proving that tenants had been notified of the sale and given the opportunity to form a tenant\u2019s union was no simple task, he said.\nCRG sent certified mail to tenants of all 134 apartments notifying them that the building was being sold, which was an expensive process, he said. But getting a response proved even more difficult.\n\u201cWe had to get a certain percentage of them to agree that they weren\u2019t going to form a tenant union, and they did not want to purchase the building,\u201d Shanabruch said. \u201cBut we did not get enough written responses from them. So we ended up sending it via Docusign, and it really took a persistent DocuSign effort to get the signatures we needed.\u201d\nShanabruch credits CedarSt\u2019s understanding of the local market for the ultimate success of the sale.\n\u201cThey were fully understanding of the ordinance because they\u2019re in the neighborhood already,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bottom line is patience is required.\u201d\nInitially another Chicago-based firm, Bradford Allen, put in a $38 million offer on the property in November 2024. But\nthat deal fell through and wound up in court.\nRepresentatives of Bradford filed a lawsuit against CRG in July, after Bradford pulled out of the deal in March. Bradford claimed that the CRG affiliate that owned the property misrepresented its operating expenses, as well as lease terms. After the deal fell through, Bradford sued to retrieve $1.9 million it deposited into escrow.\nBut CRG so far has stood firm that it has the right to keep the money, alleging Bradford Allen didn\u2019t live up to its contractual obligations as part of the sale of the property, court filings show.\nBradford also noted in court filings that the right of first refusal ordinance played a role in the deal going south because it added another complicating factor to the process, legal records show. The case is still pending in Cook County Circuit Court.\nShanabruch declined to comment on the litigation.",

The development, dubbed Platform Moffett Park, will have 294,000 square feet of office and research space, 800 parking stalls, a shuttle bus stop and 43,000 square feet of private open space.\nThe developer said it expects to spend six to 12 months securing building permits and another two years on construction.\nThe firm furthered its push into Sunnyvale earlier this year with the purchase of Mathilda Tech Park. It acquired two buildings at 755 North Mathilda Avenue and 680 Vaqueros Avenue spanning 105,000 square feet across 5 acres. Iowa Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System sold the property for an undisclosed amount, but the Santa Clara County Clerk Recorder registered the sale at $15.5 million, the outlet\nreported\n.\nElsewhere in the South Bay, in August, Ellis Partners bought the three-building\nCampus at Scott office park\nin Santa Clara.

        "content": "When Mark Nussbaum\u2019s law firm collapsed last year, it left clients scrambling to recoup missing escrow funds \u2013 and wondering where their money had gone.\nA newly filed lawsuit now points to a dead Brooklyn real estate investor as the alleged linchpin of a sprawling scheme in which hundreds of millions of dollars were siphoned from client escrow accounts.\nThe lawsuit, filed by the lawyer handling the liquidation of Nussbaum\u2019s former law firms, seeks to recover about $330 million from two entities formerly tied to the late Borough Park-based real estate investor Mendel Steiner. It alleges that Steiner ran a \u201cponzi scheme\u201d through Nussbaum Lowinger\u2019s escrow accounts to funnel client funds \u2013 a practice that the filings suggest led to the firm\u2019s demise.\nNussbaum Lowinger abruptly shuttered in January. Months later, the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office charged Mark Nussbaum with grand larceny for stealing $15 million from client escrow funds. Nussbaum has pleaded not guilty.\nThe lawsuit alleges that Steiner lured Nussbaum Lowinger clients and prospective clients into two investment schemes which escrow funds were supposedly used to \u201cshow capital\u201d for real estate deals, and another involving fabricated joint ventures tied to property acquisitions.\nSteiner\u2019s estate has not responded to the lawsuit and could not be reached for comment.\nIn a statement, Nussbaum\u2019s attorney said \u201cMr. Nussbaum fully supports the assignee\u2019s efforts to marshal assets from bona fide sources, including the Steiner estate, and he will continue to assist the assignee to the best of his ability to ensure maximum recovery for the creditors.\u201d\nScheme 1: \u201cShow capital\u201d\nUnder the first alleged scheme, Steiner pitched Nussbaum Lowinger clients on what he described as a risk-free way to earn higher monthly returns.\nClients were told to deposit millions of dollars into the firm\u2019s escrow accounts, where the money would remain untouched and be used only to \u201cshow capital\u201d to potential property sellers as proof Steiner could close a deal.\nBut the lawsuit alleges that those promises were false.\nInstead of sitting safely in escrow, the funds were transferred to Steiner-controlled entities, including Real Green Management or Aven Realty.\nTo obscure Steiner\u2019s role, Nussbaum also allegedly replaced Steiner\u2019s name in transaction documents with a purported \u201claw firm client\u201d for whom Steiner supposedly acted as an intermediary. In some cases, the lawsuit claims, that client didn\u2019t exist, or the individual was not involved in the transaction.\nSteiner would pay some of the higher returns early on to build investor confidence, the lawsuit alleges.\nScheme 2: Phantom joint ventures\nIn a second scheme, Steiner allegedly convinced clients to invest in joint ventures on property acquisitions.\nSteiner provided Nussbaum Lowinger clients a description of the property he claimed to be buying and the name of the seller. Client money was supposed to fund deposits or acquisitions and remain in escrow until closing. Steiner allegedly promised investors a fixed return plus equity in the deal. He also allegedly told clients that he had an arrangement with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development allowing him to purchase multifamily projects at auction.\nThe lawsuit alleges the deals were fabricated.\nIn some instances, the sellers did not own the properties. In others, no sales agreement existed at all. And Steiner never had an arrangement with HUD.\nInstead, Steiner allegedly used the fake transactions as another way to convince clients to put money in the Nussbaum Lowinger escrow accounts, ultimately to be transferred to Steiner\u2019s accounts, Real Green or Aven Realty.\n\u201cIn order to induce the clients to make the investments, Mendel Steiner and MJN [Mark J. Nussbaum] prepared fraudulent contracts, emails and other documents containing fictitious names and other false information,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.\nMoney transfers\nThe lawsuit sheds light on how much money was moving into Nussbaum\u2019s accounts. Eight Nussbaum Lowinger clients wired a combined $380 million to the escrow account between 2022 and 2025.\nBut Steiner\u2019s companies returned only $51.6 million to clients.\nThe lawsuit was filed as part of an alternative to bankruptcy process known as an assignment for the benefit of creditors. The lawyer handling the process, known as an assignee, is seeking to recover money to pay back creditors of Nussbaum Lowinger.\nSteiner, who died by suicide in January in a Manhattan hotel, is the largest debtor to Nussbaum\u2019s estate.\nNussbaum used his law firm as a pass-through to make bridge loans to real estate dealmakers, but many of those loans have not been paid back.\nThe lawsuit also does not provide any details about where Steiner transferred the funds after it went into his accounts. Steiner\u2019s properties have faced foreclosures and requests for receivers to be appointed, further raising questions about the value of his estate.\n",

        "content": "The MTA is taking offers for more than 300,000 square feet of development rights in Lower Manhattan.\nThe agency released a request for proposals Friday, seeking a buyer of up to 350,000 square feet of landmarked air rights tied to the Fulton Center.\nThe transit center shares a zoning lot with the Corbin Building, a terra cotta-clad office building built in 1889, which was\nlandmarked\nin 2015. Together, the two buildings are underbuilt on the lot by 358,000 square feet, of which the agency is keeping 8,000 for \u201cfuture flexibility,\u201d according to the RFP.\nThe potential pool of buyers will be limited to those who can acquire the rights through a City Planning Commission certification or through a zoning lot merger with an adjacent site. The RFP specifies that it will not accept offers from buyers whose plans would require a special permit or other land-use approval.\nMore potential buyers, however, are eligible thanks to the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity. The text amendment eased the rules around where landmarked air rights can be transferred and freed many of these deals from the special permit process. Because of those changes, the square footage can be applied to sites across the street and within the same block of the Fulton Center, without triggering the need for a special permit, as long as such a deal doesn\u2019t increase the allowable square footage of the receiving site by more than 30 percent.\nTransfers resulting in larger projects still require a special permit and, therefore, must go through the city\u2019s land-use review process.\nAir rights transfers have been on the rise since the passage of City of Yes.\nThe Real Deal\npreviously\nreported\nthat landmarked development rights have been trading for between $180 and 400 per square foot.\nBidders on the Fulton air rights must offer at least fair market value (as determined by the MTA\u2019s independent appraiser) to be considered. The RFP is due March 16, 2026.\n",

The seller was a trust tied to\nDaniel Grollo\n, an Australian real estate developer, that had upped the mortgage on the units to $18.9 million in 2016. The trust purchased two units in 2013 for $14.3 million, then purchased the remaining three over the next several years.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nIn Brooklyn Heights, a trust sold a townhouse at\n19 Cranberry Street\nfor $11 million. The buyer was an LLC managed by\nMichael Saltzman.\nThe trust had owned the home since 2022, purchasing it for $12.3 million. The five-bedroom home spans roughly 5,600 square feet and dates to 1829.\nAdam Modlin\nwith the Modlin Group and Corcoran\u2019s\nKaren Talbott, Kyle Talbott\nand\nScott Sternberg\nhad the listing.

        "content": "Access agreements are the bane of many New Yorkers trying to renovate a home.\nThese sign-offs are almost unavoidable in a city where buildings sit shoulder-to-shoulder and most apartments share walls, floors and ceilings. Both routine upgrades and ground-up construction often require workers to temporarily intrude on a neighbor\u2019s property.\nBut getting permission can be a tall order. A reluctant neighbor can send owners into months of back-and-forth. If the dispute lands in court, and many of them do, coming to a resolution can delay projects even further.\nJust last month, a trust tied to comedy writer Jill Davis and former Bain Capital managing partner Edward Conrad\nsued their neighbors\n, Sotheby\u2019s CEO Charles Stewart and his wife Catarina, over the couple\u2019s renovation of their Upper East Side townhouse. The lawsuit alleges that the parties spent years negotiating an access agreement, and that even once one was in place, the couple didn\u2019t comply with the terms.\nTo cut down on the headaches, lawmakers in Albany\nproposed legislation\naimed at establishing guidelines for the agreements and streamlining the process. Gov. Kathy Hochul signed the bill into law last week.\nThe new law only kicks in when the quest for an access agreement ends up in court. Instead of allowing judges full discretion over the terms, it outlines some standards, including requiring those seeking the agreement to ensure their neighbors have access to their insurance policies if their properties sustain any damages.\nThe statute also establishes some guardrails around the amount of compensation adjoining property owners can demand \u2014 a piece of the puzzle that often becomes contentious. The law states that while neighbors are entitled to compensation, it should be reasonable.\nStill, the law isn\u2019t exactly a catch-all fix for the strife created by obtaining these agreements, though supporters say the existence of a standard at all could encourage some parties to settle disputes out of court.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: The Durst Organization is\nlooking for a buyer\nfor two of its Theater District buildings, one of which houses Jimmy\u2019s Corner, a beloved dive bar founded by the late boxer, Jimmy Glenn. A listing for the properties at 136-140 West 44th Street bills the site as a \u201cprime development\u201d opportunity \u2014 what could replace the Midtown institution? Send thoughts to\nsheridan.wall@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nMoMA PS1, the Long Island City-based affiliate of the Museum of Modern Art, will be free for the public starting in January. The museum\u2019s latest admission numbers estimate about 200,000 people visit each year.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 A new study from Cornell University researchers found that air pollution has decreased in Manhattan since congestion pricing took effect in January,\nGothamist\nreported. Before the implementation of the controversial policy, the borough\u2019s air contained about 14 micrograms of fine particulate matter. That measure has fallen to 11.\n\u2014 The Department of Transportation threatened to cancel $73 million in federal funding for highways in New York if the state continued to allow international drivers to obtain trucking licenses,\nABC News 10\nreported. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the agency\u2019s warning came after a review found a large number of licenses issued illegally.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$10.4 million\nfor 200 Amsterdam Avenue, 32B. The Upper West Side condo is 2,700 square feet and last sold in 2021 for $9.2 million.\nBrown Harris Stevens\nLisa Lippman has the transaction.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$4.37 million\nfor an apartment building at 1643 Popham Avenue. The Morris Heights building has nine units, is four stories and 7,400 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $23.5 million for 432 Park Avenue, Unit 69B. The Midtown East condo is 4,000 square feet.\nSerhant\nhas the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 276,985-square-foot, 21-story building with 350 units at 743 East 12th Street in the East Village.

It turns out that figure is more than half a billion dollars higher than the cost of a typical retrofit for a building of that size, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n.\nA recent analysis by experts cited by the Times estimates that the Hahn building could be brought up to code for less than $150 million using common techniques applied in retrofitting other historic Los Angeles structures. Dan Rosenfeld, a developer and preservationist who is leading a campaign to halt what some see as a quiet setup for the Hahn Hall\u2019s eventual demolition, told the Times that the $700 million estimate relied on one of the most expensive methods of earthquake retrofitting.\nOfficials \u201cdidn\u2019t just put their thumb on the scale\u201d to show retrofitting was too costly and that buying the\nGas Company Tower\nwas the best option, Rosenfeld said. \u201cThey jumped on it with both feet.\u201d\nIn response, Joseph Nicchitta, acting chief executive of Los Angeles County, said \u201cthe county considered a comprehensive range of seismic options\u201d besides the most expensive ones, claiming the $700 million estimate was \u201cthe result of a competitively procured process.\u201d County officials \u201cconferred with the Department of Public Works on the various approaches [for retrofitting]\u201d that critics like Rosenfeld suggested, but the department \u201cmaintains its assessments regarding the cost, scope and budget of the retrofit project.\u201d\nLos Angeles County says there are no current plans to demolish the Hahn Hall, though L.A. County supervisor Janice Hahn \u2014 the daughter of the building\u2019s namesake \u2014 confirmed that razing much of the structure has been suggested in multiple staff meetings.\n\u201cWe are convinced that any outside, independent review would arrive at the same conclusions that we did: The building can and should be saved,\u201d Rosenfeld said. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want to move from the third floor to the 50th floor of the best building in town? But who benefits? Not the public.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Ed Okpa, head of real estate consultancy Okpa Company, is challenging the Dallas City Planning Commission\u2019s rejection of his rezoning request for Winners Tower, a proposed high\u2011rise in South Dallas.\nThe commission\nvoted against the proposal\nin October, citing concerns about potential displacement, the\nDallas Business Journal\nreported. Okpa has since filed an appeal that will send the project directly to the Dallas City Council, which could vote on it as early as January and has the authority to override the commission with a simple majority.\nThe current project plan includes a 150 to 160\u2011room hotel and 60 to 65 condos on a site that now houses a pharmacy, event center, offices and the Winners Assembly Christian Church.\nThe church is the property owner, with Okpa functioning as development adviser.\nCity staff previously recommended rezoning the site for buildings up to five stories, far below Okpa\u2019s original 25\u2011story vision. He argued that South Dallas has long been overlooked and that a signature tower could help the area compete with more affluent parts of the city.\nWhile Okpa, who ran unsuccessfully for Dallas mayor in 2003, disputes claims of displacement of residents \u2014 emphasizing that no additional land acquisition is planned \u2014 he has indicated a willingness to scale the project down to roughly 20 stories.\nEconomic impact studies commissioned by the developer estimate the project would cost $240 million, create about 200 jobs, and generate roughly $9 million in annual tax revenue. Okpa has pledged to allocate $90 million in construction spending to minority\u2011owned firms. He also told commissioners that C\u2011PACE financing could cover about $70 million of the cost, supported by the tower\u2019s planned solar\u2011energy components.\nOkpa insists on condos rather than rental housing to promote long\u2011term ownership and stability. He also argued that South Dallas lacks quality hotels, despite its proximity to Fair Park, a major regional events hub, he told the Business Journal.\nHe believes skepticism from commissioners stems partly from doubts about financing, and partly from bias related to his Nigerian background and\nimmigrant business partners\n, according to the Business Journal. Other minority entrepreneurs who have projects in the South Dallas market include Terrence Maiden\u2019s\nRussell Glen Company\nand Rev. T.D. Jakes\u2019\nnamesake firm,\nReverend T.D. Jakes Real Estate Ventures.\nMeanwhile, alternative visions for the site exist: Pastor Austin Anetekhai of Winners Assembly has floated an affordable housing tower with five to 13 stories.\nSouth Dallas has seen limited high\u2011rise development. The only comparable tower to Okpa\u2019s project is the 13\u2011story Park Manor, built in 1970, according to the Business Journal.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

        "content": "As the Alexander brothers\u2019\nsex trafficking trial\napproaches next month, details about the proceedings are beginning to take shape.\nSeveral of the alleged victims will be allowed to testify under pseudonyms at trial, Judge Valerie Caproni of the Southern District of New York ruled at a Thursday hearing.\nThe women are among other accusers tapped by prosecutors to share their experiences with one or more of the brothers, who are facing charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking, among other crimes. Former top brokers Tal and Oren Alexander, along with their brother Alon, were arrested in Miami last December.\nDuring the hearing, Caproni sided with prosecutors, who requested the court protect the identities of 17 alleged victims whose names have not yet been made public through litigation filed against one or more of the brothers.\nOren\u2019s attorney, Marc Agnifilo\n, pushed back against the use of pseudonyms, arguing that introducing too many fake names would confuse jurors and other witnesses, and block those outside of the courtroom from coming forward with potentially significant information about the alleged victims that could aid the defense.\n\u201cWhat the government is asking here is truly unprecedented,\u201d Agnifilo said.\nAgnifilo referred to a saying among toxicologists, \u201cthe dose makes the poison.\u201d He added, \u201cThe dose here is tremendous.\u201d\nThough Caproni largely agreed with the government\u2019s position, her decision came with a few caveats. Women with common names will take the stand using their real first names and a pseudonymous last name, while women who were minors at the time of the alleged attacks and those with easily recognizable first names will be allowed to use a pseudonym for both their first and last names.\nThough their identities will be shielded from the public, defense attorneys for the brothers know the real names of the alleged victims. The court will also inform the jury and any attendees of the trial that the alleged victims called to the stand are testifying under fake names.\nAgnifilo said that the defense would prefer the victims use their real first names only if the court was inclined to grant prosecutors\u2019 request. But Caproni shot down his appeal, arguing that it would be \u201cdemeaning and infantilizing\u201d to refer to alleged rape victims by their first name while other witnesses are called by their last name.\nAll three of the Alexanders have pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\u201cThis case is being framed by the government as a sex-trafficking prosecution despite the absence of evidence of force or coercion, and the defense maintains that the government\u2019s theory relies on recharacterizing consensual conduct as criminal activity,\u201d a spokesperson for the brothers wrote in a statement. \u201cThose issues, the defense expects, will be tested at trial.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear how many alleged victims prosecutors plan to introduce during the trial, though based on discussions in court, it appears they\u2019re working with more than 20. The latest version of the indictment, which was\nfiled last month\n, noted seven victims associated with substantive counts, while in a hearing shortly after, prosecutors mentioned another 17 alleged victims associated with the conspiracy charge.\nCaproni previously said that while she won\u2019t limit the number of victims prosecutors can call to the stand ahead of trial, she will not allow the entirety of its roster to testify in support of the conspiracy.\nAt another hearing last week, Caproni\nagreed to delay\nthe trial from Jan. 5 to Jan. 26. By the time proceedings begin next year, the Alexander brothers, who are being held at Brooklyn\u2019s Metropolitan Detention Center, will have been in custody for more than a year.\nNot so fast\u2026\nCould 2026 be the year interest rates lose their rep as residential real estate\u2019s boogeyman?\nEarlier this week, the Federal Reserve\nvoted to cut\ninterest rates by a quarter of a point, marking the third such move this year. While not directly tied to the federal funds rate, the central bank\u2019s decision often influences fluctuations in mortgage rates, which have remained elevated over the past few years.\nThough mortgage rates dropped in anticipation of the Fed\u2019s announcement, they\u2019re still above 6 percent, significantly higher than the historically low rates many homeowners secured during the pandemic. That discrepancy created a \u201clock-in\u201d effect, where owners who may have already sold their homes by now are staying put to hold on to their mortgages.\nIf the last year is any indication, it appears mortgage rates will hover around 6 percent for the foreseeable future. It\u2019s likely that for many sellers, time will start to outweigh a favorable rate, so in the absence of any drastic macroeconomic changes, we can finally put the hand-wringing over rates to bed.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe most expensive deal to hit the city rolls this week was a condo at Extell Development\u2019s 50 West 66th Street. The apartment traded for $22.7 million, or $6,700 per square foot, to an anonymous entity known as Little Tiger Love. Unit 43N spans 3,400 square feet and has four bedrooms and four bathrooms.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Janice Chang and Timothy Hsu had the listing.\n",

        "content": "Ever wonder why city workers are not answering your calls, returning your emails or processing your applications?\nThey might be working on one of the hundreds of meaningless reports required by city laws. There\u2019s even a law requiring the city to report how many reports are required. As of 2019, according to a 57-page analysis,\nthere were 842\n.\nThe City Council is trying hard to get to 1,000. Last week, by overriding Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 vetoes, it added another, and compounded the error by forcing businesses as well to file annual reports that will accomplish absolutely nothing.\nUnder Intro\n982-A\n, employers with more than 200 employees in the city must now submit annual pay data reports broken down by race or ethnicity and also by sex.\nA second law,\n984-A\n, requires the city to turn these reports into an analysis to identify disparities by industry. This must be done every single year, even though the numbers barely change from one year to the next.\nMike Bloomberg liked to say, \u201cYou can\u2019t fix what you can\u2019t measure.\u201d But wage disparities have been measured a thousand times. All the studies show that men make more than women and white people make more than people of color.\nBut few show why. And these two new laws are no different.\nLike most of the others, the city study required by 984-A will not show how much of the disparities stems from racism or sexism and how much is attributable to other factors, including employees\u2019 job responsibilities, hours, experience, seniority, commissions, etc.\nAs a result, it will be totally useless, except for grandstanding purposes.\nWe\u2019ve all heard the statistic that\nwomen earn 82 cents\nfor every dollar that men make. Twenty years earlier, in 2002, it was 80 cents. It barely changed because the discrepancy is caused by factors that are not affected by publicizing it.\nPoliticians like to chalk up the male-female pay gap to sexism, but economists have figured out that\nchoices by women\n\u2014 usually related to child care and working in lower-paying fields, such as teaching \u2014 are the primary reason. Discrimination is a factor, but it\u2019s small.\nReality check: If you work more hours, generally you make more money. Become a journalist and interrupt your career to raise kids, as I did, and you make less.\nIn 1982, women made 65 cents for every dollar earned by men. The big jump to 80 cents in 2002 was largely because women began going to college in greater numbers, giving birth later and spending less time at home with children.\nNo single factor explains pay gaps. But the reports newly required by the Council won\u2019t identify any factors. They will just create work for employers and agencies, making them tally numbers that have no practical value and will not change anything.\nActually, Intro 982-A could change one thing \u2014 it could deter businesses from hiring a 201st employee and subjecting themselves to this madness.\n",

        "content": "Lincoln Yards finally has a full slate of new players, and that alone marks the end of what Sterling Bay once promised would be Chicago\u2019s next great mega-development, nestled between wealthy Lincoln Park and gentrifying Bucktown.\nWith\nJDL and Kayne Anderson\nnow controlling the land north of the Chicago River and\nThe Real Deal\nbreaking the news this week that\nJohn Novak is buying the similarly stalled\nsouthern portion, the project has been rebooted. Sterling Bay\u2019s $6 billion, 14.5 million-square-foot vision isn\u2019t just being revised \u2014 it\u2019s being replaced.\nThe shift didn\u2019t happen overnight.\nSterling spent years pushing\nan audacious plan to turn former industrial land along the North Branch into a dense hub of offices, apartments, labs and entertainment. The firm deserves real credit for taking on a wildly ambitious assignment and getting as far as it did. It secured the zoning, convinced City Hall to create a tax increment finance plan and lined up heavyweight financial partners.\nBut Sterling made\nsome crucial errors\nas well. Its bet got too big, and the commercial real estate market dropped too much, for the firm to cash in. Infrastructure demands of the project multiplied, as the requirements the city thrust onto the development team\nproved too heavy to lift\n. Public support for footing a large share of those costs never fully materialized. At a certain point, the capital stack couldn\u2019t carry the vision anymore.\nNow the baton has been passed. On the north side of the Chicago River,\nJim Letchinger\u2019s JDL\nand Kayne Anderson stepped in this fall to buy former Lincoln Yards land after\nBank OZK seized the parcels\nfrom Sterling and Dallas-based Lone Star funds, setting the table for a more residential-driven plan than previously contemplated. On the south, Novak is taking control of the parcel\nJP Morgan Asset Management had been reluctant\nto take away from Sterling for over a year. Between the new owners, Lincoln Yards is no longer one coordinated megaproject but two distinct sides of the river run by unrelated teams.\nFragmentation was part of Sterling Bay\u2019s original challenge. It controlled both sides only through separate partnerships \u2014 Lone Star Funds and Bank OZK to the north, JP Morgan to the south \u2014 each with its own priorities and tolerance for risk.\nJDL and Kayne\u2019s failed effort to also buy the southern block showed the issue hasn\u2019t gone away. Chicago real estate insiders have said JP Morgan\u2019s refusal to indemnify the\nJDL-led team\nfrom loss tied to litigation that Sterling had flirted with bringing in the event the southern parcels were sold killed that transaction, though the firm hasn\u2019t commented on the matter.\nSo\nNovak\u2019s arrival\nsolves ownership on the south but introduces yet another independent operator. Whether this constellation works better the second time will depend on how closely the city corrals the groups.\nWhich brings the whole effort back to City Hall. The\nagreement Sterling Bay struck\nwith the Department of Planning and Development will almost certainly be rewritten. The previous infrastructure obligations were massive and, in hindsight, financially unrealistic without deeper public participation. Because the new developers are planning far less density, the need \u2014 and cost \u2014 for bridges, roads, utilities and transit upgrades should shrink. But the city will still have to define how much each developer pays and how much, if any, taxpayers should cover.\nThat makes the next phase simpler in some ways and more complicated in others. Easier because the ambitions are scaled back, more complex because the coordination burden shifts to the city, which must referee three owners with different business plans.\nThe Planning and Development Department declined to comment for now, other than to say that any proposed changes to past approvals and agreements would get reviewed as they\u2019re shared with city officials.\nFor Chicago residents, the hope is that any renegotiated deal improves transparency, right-sizes public exposure and finally unlocks development on one of the most valuable stretches of the river.\nLincoln Yards isn\u2019t dead but instead reincarnated. The question now is whether this new cast can do what Sterling Bay couldn\u2019t: turn land into progress rather than promise.\n",

        "content": "Downtown Los Angeles isn\u2019t what it used to be \u2014 and it seems no one knows that better than Brookfield, which now is looking to dispose of four distressed office buildings that account for nearly one-fifth of the Class A space in the Financial District.\nThe commercial giant has ceded control of some ailing offices to a court-appointed receiver, sold some at steep discounts \u2014 and it still has plenty in play. Brookfield and its lenders (and receivers and special servicers) are peddling four active offerings that totals about 4.9 million square feet of Class A office space in the submarket, roughly 18 percent of the total inventory.\nThe Financial District has a total of around 26.5 million square feet of Class A space, according to the most recent data from brokerage Avison Young (Bunker Hill is commonly considered part of the Financial District, although Avison Young breaks out the data).\nInvestors with deep pockets and hearty appetites for risk can consider:\nEY Plaza: Colliers is\nmarketing\nthe $275 million, non-preforming note tied to the property at 725 South Figueroa Street, in receivership. That note is expected to trade at a massive discount. Last the publication heard, Colliers was calling for offers. It is unclear whether it found a lucky buyer. If the brokerage did, who knows if the deal would hold \u2014 Carolwood\u2019s prior $130 million deal collapsed.\nBank of America Plaza: Colliers is\nshopping\nthe defaulted commercial mortgage-backed securities loan connected to the skyscraper at 333 South Hope Street, in receivership. The debt balance is $400 million, and the brokerage anticipates substantially discounted bids.\nWells Fargo Center\u2019s North Tower: Eastdil Secured is\nmarketing\nthe mortgage loan on 333 South Grand Avenue, which includes an office tower and a retail asset. The roughly $506 million debt on the property is in default, though it is not in the hands of a receiver. Bids are anticipated around $196 million, according to data and analytics provider Green Street.\nWells Fargo Center\u2019s South Tower: Newmark is\nshopping\nthe skyscraper \u2014 a sister to its sibling to the north \u2014 at 355 South Grand Avenue. Bids are anticipated to come in around $157 million, per Green Street, not enough to cover the $263 million debt balance that came due.\nWhat happens now?\nA truism seems to be in the works, according to an informed industry source who said the buildings will find buyers, it\u2019s just a matter of pricing.\nSounds as though downtown\u2019s office market is still bouncing along a soft bottom. Now to see if Brookfield\u2019s latest offerings set a firm floor.\nTurnbridge turns up in desert\nTurnbridge Equities\nclosed\non a long-delayed, debt-laden development in a Palm Springs-area resort city, getting the SilverRock Resort project in La Quinta out of bankruptcy for a haircut price of $65 million, or $500,000 an acre.\nThe unfinished resort\u2019s prior developer, Robert Green, defaulted on debt and later filed for bankruptcy \u2014 $270.5 million in claims. Prior estimates put the property\u2019s value at $300 million to $400 million.\nTurnbridge has a single luxe hotel with branded condominiums and estate-sized single-family homes on its mind for the 130 acres it got. The new owner anticipates that as an initial phase that will cost $735 million to build out.\nThe SilverRock Golf Course, owned and operated by the city, is set to be transferred to Turnbridge once the hotel is completed.\nThe property, at 79179 Ahmanson Lane, isn\u2019t far from where the Coachella and Stagecoach music festivals are held, ultra-exclusive Madison Club, where Apple\u2019s Tim Cook and Grammy-winning singer Adele are among the list of bold-faced names who own vacation homes there.\nUnmatch\nTinder and Hinge parent company Match Group\ndumped\na West Hollywood office building. The property at 8800 West Sunset Boulevard traded hands for $35.5 million, or around $480 per square foot.\nThe buyers appear to be Omega Law Group founding partners Edwin Saghian, Robin Saghian and Shahab Mossavar-Rahmani, who signed a loan document and are members of the limited liability company named as grantee. It could be the partners were representing a client, but their accident and injury firm is located at the purchased property, so it seems more likely they are the buyers.\n",

        "content": "The story of San Francisco has largely been one of return. The artificial intelligence industry has\nprovided the latest lick\nfor the boom or bust town, and Mayor Daniel Lurie has been hailed in his first year as the right person to steer a city now bursting with cash, investment and optimism. San Francisco, as they say, is back.\nWhat could possibly slow this fiery momentum? Well, bad press seems to be a headwind everyone wants to avoid. Remember\nthe so-called Doom Loop?\nIn human nature, persistently negative narratives have a way of becoming self-fulfilling prophecies. This fact is apparently top of mind for the powers that be in San Francisco.\nLaurie Thomas, executive director of Golden Gate Restaurant Association, said as much during a Thursday panel focused on the state of retail in San Francisco. She urged the business community to refrain from the temptation to talk to news reporters \u201cwho want the gotcha story.\u201d\n\u201cYou just have to consciously remember that we kind of build our own future,\u201d Thomas said during the event, hosted by BisNow. She encouraged those speaking with reporters to remain factual, but positive, so that \u201cthe ball rolls down the hill in the right direction. \u2026 One of the things that\u2019s been helpful is working closely with [Mayor Lurie\u2019s] administration and their comms so that we all understand everything and can reposition it. The message has to stay positive.\u201d\nJoshua Callahan, managing director at private equity firm Roxborough Group, pushed back, saying that narrative and reality in San Francisco have recently diverged. Callahan acknowledged that the city enjoyed more investment than just a couple years ago, and debt was increasingly available for new projects, but the reality for business and owners and developers remains more challenging than the \u201cSan Francisco is back\u201d narrative portrays. The costs are high and margins are thin, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still not obvious that good ideas are easy projects to do,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cIt\u2019s still really tough to believe in that growth story. It\u2019s tougher than some of the narratives are starting to make it seem.\u201d\nFifty miles to the south,\ndowntown San Jose is dealing with its own narrative vs reality.\nThe Silicon Valley office market has long subsisted on hype. According to Joshua Burroughs, COO of local developer Urban Catalyst, 90 percent of office space is built on speculation. In a region where startups can quickly grow from a garage into a Unicorn that soaks up hundreds of thousands of square feet of office space, it\u2019s critical for cities to have a healthy stock of ready-to-go offices.\nYet, for downtown San Jose, much of the office space is now empty, and developers like Urban Catalyst are scaling back their ambitious visions for the skyline. Building permits submitted to the city\u2019s planning department last week showed Urban Catalyst had revised its proposal for a 21-story office tower and a 27-story mixed-use tower into a pair of eight-story apartment buildings with 626 total new housing units.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take 600 units downtown, but to go from 20 stories to eight is uninspiring,\u201d a local economic development analyst told The Real Deal.\nThis comes as the Jay Paul Company is still searching for a tenant for its 19-story, million-square-foot\n200 Park project,\ncompleted in 2023. And Google\u2019s ambitious vision for its Downtown West neighborhood\u00a0 with 4,000 homes, 7.3 million square feet of office space, and an estimated economic impact of $19 billion, has been on hold for years.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not no hope,\u201d one city hall staffer told The Real Deal. \u201cIf we can\u2019t fill 200 Park, and we can\u2019t get the Google project going, then I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see the office market move.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Kenny Wolfe\n\u2014 now that\u2019s a name you haven\u2019t heard in a while.\nThe Dallas-based syndicator\u2019s spectacular flame-out matched his hubris \u2014 a quality that separated him from his peers who were also using the pooled-equity model of multifamily investing.\nThe student of\nmultifamily mentor Brad Sumrok\ntried to make the jump from operating a string of dollar stores across the Midwest and shabby apartment complexes in Texas to executing one of the most challenging types of projects in the world of real estate development: An office to residential conversion.\nIt may not come as a surprise that\nhe didn\u2019t stick the landing\n.\nHe set his sights on conversion projects in iconic downtown buildings in Dallas, Fort Worth and Cleveland, but bit off more than he could chew. His portfolio was wiped out almost as quickly as it was built.\nHis story might be over (for now at least), but the buildings he owned are still in play.\nA downtown Dallas property he planned to convert to apartments\nhit the market\nalmost two years after Wolfe\u2019s lender took the keys back at a foreclosure auction. The capital stack for 211 North Ervay, an iconic mid-century office tower built in 1958, included a $13 million loan from Thistle Creek Capital, which bought the building back in an $8 million credit bid, or $43 per square foot.\nIf you\u2019ve ever walked around downtown Dallas, you\u2019ve seen this building. It\u2019s covered in turquoise porcelain panels, sticking out like a modernist sore thumb among the glass facades and brick exteriors that populate the urban core.\nWolfe may not have displayed much sense in taking on 211 N Ervay, but he wasn\u2019t completely off the mark on his plans. Experts agree the building has potential.\nA 2023 paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in coordination with New York University and Columbia University identified the property as one of 50 North Texas buildings structurally ripe for conversion. Arpit Gupta, the New York University professor who authored the report, said the building \u201cmet all the criteria\u201d for a conversion candidate.\nFeeling as ambitious as Kenny Wolfe? This mid-century gem could be yours. Avison Young has the listing and is marketing the nearly vacant property as a redevelopment play. The listing has no asking price.\nRemembering a pioneer of the mixed-use sports venue\nDallas investor Tom Hicks,\nwho died on Saturday\nat the age of 79, didn\u2019t just own sports teams \u2014 the Dallas Stars, Texas Rangers and Liverpool Football Club \u2014 he helped usher in a new era of sports real estate. Hicks foresaw the success of districts that integrate sports complexes with other uses, like offices, retail and multifamily. As owner of the Stars, Hicks partnered with Ross Perot Jr. to usher in the development of Victory Park, the entertainment district across Woodall Rogers Freeway from downtown. The pair developed American Airlines Center, which opened in 2001. It\u2019s the home arena for the Stars and the Dallas Mavericks.\nHighland Park home sets 2025 record\nGuinn and Betsy Crousen\u2019s mansion at 4000 Euclid Avenue in Highland Park\nsold with an asking price of $32.5 million\n, making it the most expensive residential sale in Texas this year.\nThe 19,000-square-foot home, built in 2015, features imported French materials, a gold-leafed dome, a courtyard with a pool, and one of the largest lots in Highland Park. The asking price amounts to about $1,700 per square foot.\nRefi! At The Quad\nStream Realty Partners scored a\nrefi deal for The Quad\n, a newly redeveloped office and retail campus in Uptown Dallas. KREF Capital, the real estate investment arm of KKR, provided the $228.2 million loan, which will replace a prior $181 million construction loan for the site\u2019s redevelopment. JLL arranged the deal, which further proves investors\u2019 interest in Uptown office properties.\n",

        "content": "Anyone who thought the final nail had been hammered in the dispute between cities and the state over builder\u2019s remedy might want to think again.\nLet\u2019s revisit the latest in the saga involving\nHuntington Beach\n, starting with the observation that there was some presumptive PR at play when Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta issued a joint declaration of \u201cvictory\u201d on Thursday. The win they claimed came when the California Supreme Court declined to review a lower-court decision on whether charter city status could be a loophole in challenges to builder\u2019s remedy.\nThe lower court waived off any such special status. It more specifically put legal clamps on\nHuntington Beach\n\u2019s fight against state law requiring local jurisdictions to create a \u201chousing element\u201d as a plan to meet mandated levels of housing production.\nSure, there was room for the governor and AG to claim a win in the latest legal round \u2014 but Huntington Beach still has a hand to play\nIn a lawsuit separate from the state\u2019s, Huntington Beach headed to U.S. District Court to challenge the\u00a0 housing mandates based on their constitutionality. Charter cities \u2014 such as Huntington Beach, Los Angeles and San Francisco \u2014 are called that for a reason. They have charters that function as municipal constitutions of sorts.\u00a0 In some cases, a charter can shield a city from state regulation. Election laws and prevailing wage are areas where courts have found the city charter and ordinances to have the final say on a local matter.\nHuntington Beach\u2019s federal lawsuit is now at the U.S. Supreme Court, where a petition from the city seeks a review of lower-court rulings.\nThat\u2019s partly what allowed the city to waive off the state-level denial for review Newsom and Bonta touted as a win.\n\u201cThe city will continue to vigorously defend its environmental stewardship, its charter-city authority and its right to fair and evenhanded enforcement of state housing laws in the superior court,\u201d Huntington Beach said in a statement Thursday.\nWhat\u2019s CEQA got to do with it?\nA lot, actually.\nIf one looks at how Huntington Beach is arguing its case legally, the California Environmental Quality Act has plenty to do with the city\u2019s legal posturing.\nWhen CEQA went into effect in 1970, it set into motion a series of rules that have been pieced together over the decades, leaving the mess of interpretation and enforcement up to local government.\nHuntington Beach asserts that the housing element puts it in a precarious situation with CEQA. That, the city said, opens it up to \u201cpenalties unless it adopts a housing element, even though CEQA prohibits adoption until environmental review is completed and lawful findings can be made.\u201d\nUltimately, the question of how builder\u2019s remedy plays with existing state regulations is only just getting started.\nLawsuit seeks no change on SB 9\nNewsom\u2019s carveout from a law allowing for\nsplit lots\nto build more density in Los Angeles\u2019 burn areas is also facing a legal challenge now that YIMBY Law has filed suit against Newsom, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Los Angeles County, along with the cities of Los Angeles, Pasadena and Malibu.\nThe challenge comes to Senate Bill 9, which went into effect at the start of 2022, allows owners to split single-family lots for the purpose of building another home or adding an accessory dwelling unit.\nThe housing advocacy group contends that suspending SB 9 will make the rebuilding process harder on property owners who might need to sell a portion of their lot or use part of their property for generating rental income.\nTurnover and retention\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty landed a big get when the\nWalters | Plaxen Group\nannounced it was parting ways with the Beverly Hills Estates this past week.\nThe seven-person group is led by Nicole Plaxen and Shauna Walters, with the two closing over $1 billion in career sales.\nThe change of scenery comes after former Beverly Hills Estates broker of record and general manager Matthew Clayman left to lead Coldwell Banker Realty\u2019s Beverly Hills and Hancock Park offices. Clayman recently recruited Severin Braham, former director of operations for the Williams and Williams Estates Group at the Beverly Hills Estates.\nOther departures from the brokerage include Shana and Emila Tavangarian, the daughters of luxury spec developer Ardie Tavangarian, who left for Carolwood Estates; Mick Partridge, who also left for Carolwood; and Greg LaPlant, who is also now with Coldwell Banker, per Department of Real Estate records.\n",

        "content": "The real estate industry rallied behind Eileen Higgins, who was elected to be Miami\u2019s next mayor in last week\u2019s runoff election.\nHiggins\u2019 win was a major upset for the Democrats. She is the first female mayor of Miami and the first Democrat in the position since 1997. The former Miami-Dade County commissioner was running against ex-City Manager Emilio Gonzalez, who scored President Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement. Higgins is also taking over from Republican Francis Suarez, a longtime favorite among developers and brokers, who has been mayor of Miami since 2017 and who helped push through major projects, including the Miami Freedom Park mixed-use stadium development.\nHiggins and Gonzalez both promised to fix the city\u2019s ineffective permitting process, improve housing affordability and clean up corruption at City Hall.\nBut Higgins has a\ntrack record with developers\n. As a county commissioner, she approved projects with nearly 7,000 affordable and workforce housing units.\nShe also raised nearly 10 times more campaign donations from real estate professionals, corporations and land use attorneys than Gonzalez, according to finance reports for their campaigns released after the Nov. 4 election. The prominent land use law firm Bercow Radell Fernandez Larkin &amp; Tapanes co-hosted a fundraiser for Higgins at Brightline Station in downtown Miami last month, where other hosts named on the invitation included Integra Investments developer Nelson Stabile, Adler Properties CEO Jonathan Raiffe and Florida East Coast Industries\u2019 exec Jose Gonzalez.\nJeff Berkowitz and his wife Yolanda, zoning lawyers Iris Escarra and Melissa Tapanes Llahues, Cervera Real Estate\u2019s Alicia Cervera Lamadrid, land use attorney Anthony De Yurre and more LLCs tied to Integra and Adler also contributed to her campaign.\nIt\u2019s unknown yet if Higgins will accomplish her campaign promises of building more housing and fixing the permitting process, but developers, brokers, lenders and their attorneys will be watching.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nAt the Sunny Isles condo association meeting last week, someone tried to block people from entering and then\nripped up ballots\n.

If you know of any that should be featured, send me an email.\nTrial lawyer Stephen Zack sold his eight-bedroom, nine-bathroom and two-half bathroom unit on the 54th floor of the Four Seasons condo-hotel at 1425 and 1435 Brickell Avenue to a land trust. The trust is owned by Santo Politi, co-founder of Spark Capital, and Eleanor Gray. The trust paid $9 million for the unit, in a deal brokered by Compass\u2019 Audrey Ross and Douglas Elliman\u2019s Devin Kay.\nFund manager Peter Hochfelder, president of the La Gorce Country Club, paid $9 million for the non-waterfront home at 450 West 62nd Street in Miami Beach. Nelson Gonzalez with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty represented the seller, Priority Payments Local CEO Sal Didonato, while Compass\u2019 Chad Carroll brought the buyer. Hochfelder is moving from his Park Grove condo in Coconut Grove.\nElsewhere in Florida\nFlorida cut nearly 20 percent of its environmental protection jobs and reduced environmental spending by 7 percent over the past 15 years, the most of any state, according to the\nOrlando Sentinel\n. The cuts, enacted under governors Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis, come as climate threats intensify.\nFlorida health officials moved to drop four school vaccine requirements without legislative or gubernatorial approval, the\nMiami Herald\nreports. It advances Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo\u2019s push to end vaccine mandates.\nMost Citizens Property Insurance customers could see lower premiums next year. South Florida homeowners would see the biggest drops, with more than three-quarters of policyholders in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties facing proposed cuts of roughly 12 to 13 percent, according to the\nSun Sentinel\n.",

        "content": "The Village of Schaumburg\u2019s zoning board recommended approval of a residential redevelopment of the 33\u2011acre Loeber Farm property, despite objections from neighboring Rolling Meadows residents.\nUnder a proposal from Nitti Development, the farm at 2014 North Meacham Road would turn into 43 single\u2011family homes, 37 row houses across eight buildings and 42 townhouses in 16 buildings, the\nDaily Herald reported\n. The village board is scheduled to vote on final approval Jan. 13.\nTo support the project, Schaumburg has begun the process of extending a nearby tax increment financing district north to include the farm. The extension would help fund public improvements required for the development, tying the project into larger redevelopment around Algonquin and Meacham roads.\nThe farm represents the village\u2019s last large undeveloped parcel, and\nplans have floated\nfor more than 20 years.\nAt the zoning board meeting on Wednesday, nine Rolling Meadows residents raised concerns about drainage impacts along Salt Creek, which already experiences flooding, and traffic congestion on Meacham Road, the sole access point to the site. While some residents acknowledged that development is inevitable, they argued that the proposal lacked firm guarantees to mitigate environmental and traffic impacts.\nResident Mike Bryskier criticized the plan as \u201cwishful thinking dressed up as a plan.\u201d\nIn response, the zoning board added new conditions to the project. These include appointing a construction liaison to keep neighbors informed throughout the building process, and restricting outdoor construction hours to 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., with no Sunday work allowed.\nZoning board Chairman Harry Raimondi emphasized that the village would closely monitor the developer\u2019s performance, stressing that Schaumburg aims to ensure neighbors are not adversely affected. The project sits\nnear the Schaumburg border\nwith Rolling Meadows.\nNitti Development, headed by Frank Nitti, originally proposed 357 housing units on the farm,\na mix\nof apartments and townhomes. In response to the objections, the developer\nscaled back plans\nfor the site.\nThe Loeber Farm redevelopment represents one of the area\u2019s larger infill housing proposals, and its approval would advance Schaumburg\u2019s broader strategy to add residential density and support infrastructure upgrades through tax increment financing.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

It also marks the lowest median listing price in Fort Worth all year, according to GFWAR.\nUp to the summer, Fort Worth\u2019s median home listing price remained above 2024 levels by a comfortable margin. In July, though, it fell 2.3 percent, year-over-year, to about $337,000, while the median price rose in Dallas by 1.6 percent to $452,000. Since then, the median home listing price in Fort Worth has lagged, year-over-year, every month except October, when it equaled the median listing price of October 2024.\nThe shift represents a\ncoming-to-grips moment\nfor Fort Worth sellers, who have long enjoyed the upper hand in negotiations.\n\u201cEverybody who\u2019s in the game \u2014 economists, lenders, realtors \u2014 we all understand that what we saw three or four years ago is not sustainable,\u201d said GFWAR President Paul Epperley.\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually pretty happy with the stability of the market,\u201d he said. \u201cHomes are still selling, buyers are still buying; maybe not at the fever pitch that they were.\u201d\nThe Dallas/Fort Worth area hit a market value peak in the summer of 2022, according to Zillow data.\nWhile Dallas sellers consider their homes more expensive this year, the market disagrees.\nSale prices declined 3.3 percent in November\n, according to Redfin \u2014 putting Dallas right next to Fort Worth, with a decline of 3.9 percent, at the top of the national leaderboard.\nOther cities in the Texas Triangle are also adjusting to the buyer\u2019s market.

King Street Capital Management and Blue Owl Capital originated the floating-rate loan.\nAn Eastdil Secured team including Rob Turner, Grant Frankel and Ethan Pond arranged the deal, which was first reported last month by PERE Credit.\nThe refinancing retires a $463 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan.\nThe real estate investment firm previously missed a required balloon payment on the debt, which matured in June, according to CRED iQ.

Savanna was then hoping to land a refinancing deal within 90 days, according to service commentary.\nIn addition to retiring the old debt, Savanna plans to use proceeds from the refinancing to build an amenity center and improve tenant spaces. The building is 80 percent leased today, but the landlord has its sights set on occupancy north of 95 percent next year.\nSavanna\u2019s been coping with its own distress while simultaneously continuing to make more bets on the office market.\nIn February, the company bought the leasehold on 430 West 15th Street in the Meatpacking District for\n$85 million\n, a sharp discount to the $159 million that Invesco had paid for the property in 2018.\nAnd last November, Savanna bought the newly constructed office building at 799 Broadway for\n$255 million\n, after owner Columbia Property Trust had defaulted on its $270 million mortgage.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The last building to do so was CBSK Irongate\u2019s new development co-op at 1228 Madison Avenue.\nThe two apartments were among 33 properties asking $4 million to find a buyer last week. The total was up from 29 in the\nprevious period\n.\nThe most expensive was Unit 12C, with an asking price of $26.8 million. Wall Street executive Richard Cantor and his wife, psychiatrist Pamela Cantor, bought the 3,300-square-foot condo from the developer in 2007 for $14.2 million.\nThe three-bedroom, three-bathroom home, which hit the market in September, features a terrace, a formal dining room and a study with views of Central Park.\nThe Mercedes Berk Team with Engel &amp; V\u00f6lkers New York City had the listing.\nThe second most expensive was Unit 14B, which last asked $25 million. The condo, which hit the market in May asking $27.5 million, last traded for $14.5 million in 2008, when a buyer whose identity is shielded by an anonymous entity purchased it from the developer.\nThe apartment spans 3,400 square feet and has four bedrooms and three bathrooms. The deal also includes a 6th-floor studio, which the seller bought for roughly $1 million.\nCorcoran\u2019s Cathy Franklin, Alexis Bodenheimer and Shannon Suydam had the listing.\nThe Robert A.M. Stern-designed tower pushed condo pricing in Manhattan to new heights when sales launched in the early 2000s. It\u2019s since drawn a number of top-dollar deals and big-name buyers, including Hyundai CEO Euisun Chung, who bought a unit from infamous Italian cosmetics mogul Piofrancesco Borgetti for\n$16.5 million\n.\nAmenities in the building include a fitness center, pool, private restaurant and terrace.\nOf the 33 properties, 25 were condos, five were co-ops, one was a condop and two were townhouses.\nThe homes asked a combined $282 million, which works out to an average price of $8.5 million and a median of $6 million. The typical home was on the market for roughly a year and a half and had a discount of 6 percent.",

        "content": "After inking the biggest new downtown office lease Chicago has seen in three years, Sargent &amp; Lundy decided it still isn\u2019t enough.\nThe Chicago-based energy engineering firm leased three additional floors at the 51-story tower at 77 West Wacker Drive, expanding its commitment that it made a year ago by roughly 66,000 square feet, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The move boosts Sargent &amp; Lundy\u2019s total space in the tower to nearly 448,000 square feet, about 60 percent more than it occupies currently at its longtime home at\n55 East Monroe Street\n.\nThe expansion sweetens what was already one of the most consequential leasing wins for the Loop office market since the pandemic. When Sargent &amp; Lundy signed its initial deal at 77 West Wacker late last year, it marked the largest new downtown office lease since Kirkland &amp; Ellis\u2019 2021 commitment at Salesforce Tower.\nSavills brokers Joe Learner and Robert Sevim represented Sargent &amp; Lundy. CBRE\u2019s Michael Kazmierczak, Kelsey Scheive and Aaron Schuster handle leasing at the tower.\nInstead of following the prevailing post-pandemic trend of shrinking office space, Sargent &amp; Lundy is going the other way. The company\u2019s growing appetite for space cements its status as one of the largest tenants in Chicago\u2019s urban core and adds momentum in the Loop, as the market looks ahead to Google opening its revamped\nThompson Center campus\nnext year.\nThe need for more space is tied directly to headcount. When Sargent &amp; Lundy announced its initial Wacker Drive lease in December 2024, the firm said it planned to add 300 Chicago jobs. Those roles have since been filled, and the company now expects to hire another 200 local employees, spokeswoman Brenda Romero told the publication.\nThe biggest beneficiary of the firm\u2019s growth is the building\u2019s owner, the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio.\nSTRS Ohio\nhas owned the 960,000-square-foot tower\nsince 2008\n, but occupancy slid sharply over the years as major law firms including Jones Day, Morgan Lewis &amp; Bockius and Greenberg Traurig moved out.\nSargent &amp; Lundy\u2019s anchor lease reversed that erosion. The pension fund had already signaled confidence in the building by paying off a\n$150 million mortgage in 2023\nand investing in a new amenity floor. With the latest expansion, the property is now nearly full, according to Costar.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher",

Gotham locked in a 99-year lease with a base rent of $500,000 annually, which will jump 12.5 percent every five years.\nThe $100 million development will be built on the site of a former MTA-owned parking lot. Notable aspects of the project include 10 percent of units being income-restricted, 15,000 square feet of retail space and a public plaza.\nThere will also be residential amenities, such as a co-working space, a fitness center, a roof terrace with barbecue grills and a multisport simulator.\nWhile the necessary applications have yet to be submitted, Gotham anticipates starting a 20-month construction process in 2027.\nThe site has been in play multiple times over the years. In 2022, Florida-based Mill Creek Residential earned the blessing of the MTA to develop the site. But Mill Creek failed to make progress on a development, leading the MTA to reopen its Request for Proposals last May.\nA stop away on the morning train to Manhattan, Farmingdale-based Terwilliger &amp; Bartone Properties is\nplanning a $61 million project\non Jerusalem Avenue near Hicksville\u2019s high-trafficked train station.

        "content": "It\u2019s official: New York City is getting three casinos.\nThe state\u2019s Gaming Commission on Monday conditionally approved granting casino licenses to the three proposals that cleared a key board this month, bringing to a close a years-long competition that once included a dozen visions for facilities throughout the city.\nThe winners are Steve Cohen\u2019s Metropolitan Park, an $8 billion facility planned near Citi Field; the proposed $4 billion complex at Bally\u2019s Golf Links at Ferry Point; and Resorts World\u2019s $7.5 billion expansion of the Queens Aqueduct. The Commission, however, only approved the facilities on the condition that the companies agree to have an independent monitor to ensure that they adhere to the various promises they made to their respective communities.\nAfter the meeting, Commission Chair Brian O\u2019Dwyer said the independent monitor will track pledges made by the casino teams, both within and outside their formal applications.\n\u201c[If] the monitor tells us that there has not been substantial compliance with every single thing that they have promised, {it] comes back to us for further consideration, up to and including the revocation of the license,\u201d\nO\u2019Dwyer said. \u201cWe\u2019re holding their feet to the fire.\u201d\nHe said the state will hear from the monitor on a quarterly basis for at least five years, and will be watching how the teams ensure that the projects benefit their surrounding communities. He said diversity is important to the commission, a nod to concerns previously raised by officials that none of the proposals made binding commitments to hire a diverse workforce.\nThe Commission\u2019s decision was largely expected, though leaders have emphasized that the process wasn\u2019t simply a rubber stamp. The Commission was tasked with ensuring the proposals met statutory licensing requirements, following\napproval\nby the five-member Gaming Facility Location Board this month.\nBally\u2019s and Resorts World will have an initial licensing term of 15 years, while Metropolitan Park\nYears-long process\nMonday\u2019s approval was more than a decade in the making. Voters approved a change to the state constitution in 2013, allowing for up to seven casinos to open throughout New York, with four upstate and three downstate.\nThe state awarded the four licenses upstate within a few years. In 2022, the state legislature added a new feature to the downstate approvals, requiring proposals to receive two-thirds support from Community Advisory Committees, a body of five to six members appointed by city, state and local officials.\nBefore reaching that stage, some competitors\ndropped out\nwhen it became clear that they couldn\u2019t secure the necessary local support. Eight bids ultimately competed, and the CACs only approved half, eliminating\nevery Manhattan\nand Brooklyn proposal. In October, MGM Resorts\nquit\nthe race, citing shifting \u201ccompetitive and economic assumptions\u201d underpinning its bid to turn its Yonkers facility into a full-fledged casino.\nThat left three teams to potentially each snag a license.\nThe state\u2019s consultants estimate that the trio could generate $7 billion in incremental gaming tax revenue from 2027 to 2036, as well as $5.9 billion in other local and state taxes. Critics, however, have pointed out that the upstate casinos\nhave not\nmet their initial revenue and tax targets.\nIn its\nreport\n, the Gaming Facility Location Board expressed concern that teams would backtrack or otherwise fail to keep the promises they made to advance in the casino competition. The board also pointed out that Resorts World overestimated its annual tax revenue projections, pegging them at more than $1 billion in revenue each year. The board\u2019s consultants projected revenue would total more than $4 billion over a decade.\nThe winners\nAt Metropolitan Park, Cohen and Hard Rock International plan to turn 50 acres worth of parking lots next to Citi Field into a casino complex with nearly 300,000 square feet of gaming space, a 1,000-room hotel, a 5,650-person live music venue, restaurants and 25 acres of green space.\nThe team also\npledged\n, in partnership with Slate Property Group, to build 450 affordable housing units at 54-19 100th Street in Corona, roughly two miles away from the casino.\nThe Bally\u2019s casino will be built on 16 acres of parking lots and practice green at Bally\u2019s Golf Links at Ferry Point. The project is expected to include 3,500 gaming machines, 250 table games, 500 hotel rooms and a 2,000-seat entertainment venue.\nAs a result of Bally\u2019s securing a license, the Trump Organization is also a winner. When it acquired the golf course\u2019s lease from the Trump Organization in 2023, Bally\u2019s\nagreed\nto pay Trump $115 million if it won a license.\nAt the Queens Aqueduct, Resorts World plans to add 6,000 slot machines and 800 table games, as well as 2,000 hotel rooms and a 7,000-seat arena. The company has also agreed, through an agreement with\nCirrus Real Estate\n, to invest in 50,000 workforce housing units citywide.\nResorts World estimates it will open a full-fledged gaming facility in March 2026, and then complete the expanded complex in 2031. Bally\u2019s and Metropark are expected to open in mid-2030. In its report, however, the state board noted that these projections seemed ambitious and might be overly optimistic, given various regulatory and construction challenges.\n",

        "content": "The Los Angeles City Council voted in favor of expanding the citywide adaptive reuse ordinance in an effort to stimulate housing growth by making it easier for developers to convert vacant offices into housing.\nThe new ordinance repeals Los Angeles\u2019 existing Adaptive Reuse Incentive Areas Specific Plan, which limited conversions to certain parts of the city including downtown, Chinatown, Hollywood and Koreatown, opening all areas within city limits to adaptive reuse projects, Bisnow\nreported\n. The new legal framework also lowers the age of the buildings that can be considered for adaptive reuse to structures that are at least 15 years old, broadening the pool of potential targets beyond buildings built before 1974. More projects will also be able to receive approval by right under the new law, the Los Angeles Daily News\nreported\n.\nThe city has been working to update the adaptive reuse rules since 2023. Across the city, office-to-residential conversions could create approximately 4,400 homes, according to a RentCafe\nreport\nfrom earlier this year.\nLos Angeles\u2019 existing adaptive reuse rules date back to 1999. That legislation helped kick off the construction of more than 12,000 housing units downtown, helping turn the area from a strictly business district into a residential and commercial hub for residents.\nLos Angeles\nranks second nationwide\nin adaptive reuse projects. L.A. has 5,640 apartments in the works, following behind Manhattan with 11,000 such units.\nOffice buildings are the hottest target for conversion in the City of Los Angeles, with 11 adaptive reuse projects in development as of July, RentCafe reported, citing Yardi Matrix data. Those office-to-resi pursuits combine for a total of 2,843 apartments or about 50 percent of the city\u2019s adaptive reuse housing pipeline.\nJamison Services leads the adaptive reuse race\nin the city, building the three largest office-to-residential projects to date. Those include the conversion of a 33-story office building at\n1055 West 7th Street\ndowntown into 691 apartments; the 19-story L.A. Superior Court Tower at\n600 South Commonwealth Avenue\nbecoming 428 units; and an 18-story building at 695 Vermont Avenue in Koreatown transforming into 255 apartments.\nThe City of Los Angeles is\nrequired\nby the state to plan for 456,643 new housing units by 2029.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

BXP bought the site in 2016 for $78 million. Its assessed value at the top of this year was $89.1 million, the Mercury News\nreported\n.\nThe property was home to a 218,366-square-foot office building that has since been demolished. A BXP affiliate previously submitted plans to build nearly 700,000 square feet of offices and parking facilities on the property. That proposal called for two eight-story office buildings connected by bridges and an accompanying four-level parking garage. The buildings under that plan each totaled 338,155 square feet for a combined 676,300 square feet, per Santa Clara records cited by the Mercury News.\nThe city approved architectural permits in 2022, as well as a permit extension earlier this year, though BXP\u2019s extension request noted that market conditions could make the project infeasible. The request also claimed that the timeline for\nSilicon Valley Power to provide sufficient power\nto the site \u201cexceeds a reasonable timeline to develop the site and attract tenants.\u201d\nIn July, Bay Area-based\nSummerHill Homes\nsubmitted a preliminary application with the City of Santa Clara to build 292 townhome-style condominiums at the site. The City of Santa Clara is\nmandated\nby the state to plan for 11,632 new housing units by 2031.\nPalo Alto Networks could pursue BXP\u2019s proposal for offices, as the cybersecurity company\u2019s headquarters are located adjacent to the 3625 Peterson Way site. Its exact plans for the former BXP property have not been disclosed. With BXP\u2019s offices blueprint, the development location could be large enough to accommodate between 2,700 to 3,400 workers, according to the Mercury News.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The University of Austin is planting a physical flag in Elon Musk country.\nThe upstart institution said it is well into construction on an applied engineering lab adjacent to The Boring Company\u2019s headquarters in Bastrop County east of Austin, deepening a link between the university and Musk\u2019s expanding network of companies, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n. A social media post on Friday from the school showed the building nearing completion, close to the intersection of Walker Watson Road and FM 1209, about 30 miles east of Downtown Austin, with the caption \u201ccoming soon.\u201d\nThe social media post landed alongside a separate post from\nBoring\n, which said it recently completed a two-week co-op program with the University of Austin. Ten students worked \u201caround the clock on real-world underground detection and communication technologies,\u201d the tunneling firm said in the post. Neither the university nor Boring provided additional details about the facility, and representatives for the school, the company and Bastrop County did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the publication.\nThe lab appears to be the latest piece of development tied to Musk along a rapidly transforming stretch of land near the Colorado River. Since 2021, Musk-linked entities have assembled close to 700 acres in\nBastrop County\n, creating a campus-like environment that now includes headquarters for\nBoring and X\n, a growing SpaceX manufacturing operation, housing, a private school, retail amenities and other infrastructure. Much of what\u2019s happening there has emerged through social media breadcrumbs, public filings and piecemeal reporting.\nRumors have circulated for months that the University of Austin was aligning itself with Musk\u2019s companies and planning a Bastrop presence. The university, founded in 2021 and currently operating out of the Scarborough Building downtown, is not accredited, but has leaned heavily into applied sciences, free speech branding and high-profile partnerships.\nProperty records suggest the new lab is being built on land tied to Musk\u2019s orbit. An Austin-based entity called Bastrop Property Trust acquired a 29-acre site across Walker Watson Road from Boring\u2019s headquarters in 2024. While ownership details are obscured, the deed traces back to a\nBoca Chica\nlaw firm known for representing Musk-affiliated entities in both Cameron and Bastrop counties.\nThe University of Austin was founded by a roster of prominent conservative thinkers and media figures, including CBS News\u2019 editor-in-chief Bari Weiss, venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale and historian Niall Ferguson, all of whom remain on its board. The school recently announced a $100 million donation from billionaire trader Jeffrey Yass as part of a $300 million fundraising push.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

That\u2019s a 56 percent decline from the property\u2019s 2015 valuation of $770 million.\nRudin declined to comment.\nThe reappraisal comes a month after the company landed a\nfour-year extension\non its $425 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan at the property. The debt\nhit special servicing\nin September due to \u201cimminent maturity default\u201d after a representative for Rudin requested the transfer to allow for negotiations to kick off for a loan modification.\nThose negotiations resulted in a four-year extension, which includes two one-year renewal options, pushing the debt maturity as far back as November 2029. Rudin will also invest $100 million in capital improvements, renovating the lobby, adding an on-site leasing center and elevating the street-level retail.\nRudin bought the former AT&amp;T headquarters in 1999 for $150 million and invested $100 million into the building, which was near full occupancy a decade ago. Rudin borrowed $425 million to refinance the property in 2015 with a CMBS-backed loan underwritten by JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank.\nBut occupancy\ndropped sharply\nduring the pandemic and was at only 57 percent as of June, according to Fitch Ratings. CenturyLink Communications downsized significantly in 2021; Dentsu Holdings USA also downsized and ultimately relocated; and iHeartMedia division AMFM Operating also moved locations when its lease expired in 2022.\nThe largest tenant at the 28-story, 1.2-million-square-foot building is tech company Telx, whose 146,000-square-foot lease expires in 2033, per Morningstar. Remaining tenants also include Cedar Cares and MCI Communications Services. Dorilton and Industrious\nsigned a 52,000-square-foot lease\nfor the 13th floor back in 2021.\n",

They total $183.2 million in asking dollar volume.\nFain and his wife, Colleen, own the 10,840-square-foot mansion at 700 Arvida Parkway, which topped the report.

The 7,635-square-foot house is asking nearly $30 million with Douglas Elliman\u2019s Dina Goldentayer and Joel Lusky of The Brokerage South Florida.

        "content": "Even in Chicago\u2019s hot multifamily market, some buyers are scoring discounts.\nIn a deal that signals caution to condo deconversion specialists, Laramar Group bought the Wave Lakeview apartments from Strategic Properties of North America for $57 million. The seller last refinanced the property for $62 million in 2019, public records show. .\nSPNA converted the nearly 60-year-old building from condos to apartments in 2017 and took out a $46 million loan from Ladder Capital to help fund the deconversion, according to public records.\nSPNA, based in Lakewood, New Jersey and Skokie, and led by Saul Kupperwasser and Yitzy Klor, has had a consistent presence in downtown Chicago real estate for more than a decade. Many of the company\u2019s biggest deals in the city have been condo deconversions.\nIt\u2019s unclear how much total capital SPNA put into the deconversion of the Wave Lakeview at 420 West Belmont, or if the company paid down the principal on its latest $62 million note from MF1 before selling the property to Laramar this month.\nFor Chicago-based Laramar, led by CEO Jeffrey Elowe, the discounted purchase could spell a win. Chicago\u2019s multifamily market has\nbeen heating up throughout this year\n, topping national rent growth charts.\nWave Lakeview, in the upscale northside neighborhood of Lakeview, consists of 88 studios, 98 one-bedroom/one-bathroom apartments, and 20 two-bedroom/one-bathroom units. It also includes ground-floor retail space and an indoor pool.\nStill, the building has faced its share of challenges. Loan records indicate Wave Lakeview struggled to generate income for SPNA while it owned and operated it.\nWhen SPNA refinanced the 30-story, 207-unit property with MF1 in 2019, the lender bundled the $62 million debt into a collateralized loan obligation package, public records show. Doing so made some of the loan\u2019s details public.\nThe loan was watchlisted by its servicer in May 2021 for having a debt-to-service coverage ratio under 1, meaning the building\u2019s income was not covering its operating costs, according to commercial debt tracker MorningStar Credit.\nIt was later removed from the watchlist in August 2021 when SPNA secured an extension on the loan.\nThe current health of the loan is harder to determine because MF1 appears to have taken the debt off the public market at some point in 2022.\nRepresentatives of MF1 and SPNA did not respond to requests for comment. A representative of Laramar declined to comment.\nThe sale follows SPNA\u2019s attempts and failures to initiate two new condo deconversion deals in Chicago.\nThe company bought dozens of condos at the 467-unit Ontario Place in River North, but after three years of negotiations,\nfailed to close a $190 million purchase of the remaining units\n. The deal imploded in June 2023 when SPNA failed to put up $700,000 as a show of good faith to the remaining sellers.\nIn 2024, SPNA\nfumbled a second condo deconversion deal at the building at 200 North Dearborn\n. The condo board voted to terminate an agreement with SPNA to sell the remaining units for $90 million, after the company failed repeatedly to secure the financing needed to close the deal.\nSPNA\u2019s sale of the Wave is likely part of\na broader strategy to sell off existing properties\n.\nIn October, the company also\nlisted the K Square Apartments\nin Lincoln Park. SPNA converted the 22-story, 268-unit property from condos to rentals in 2018, and listed the building for sale in 2023 with CBRE, before eventually taking it off the market. It is now listed with Berkadia brokers Nick Harris, Pete Evans and Richard Evans.",

        "content": "Selling an Upper East Side townhouse can be a lot like turning around a supertanker.\nThe palatial homes often sit on the market for years as listing agents nudge them into shape: replace the turn-of-the-century finishes, modernize appliances, and of course, whittle away at the price.\nWhen one sells, it is no small feat.\nThe home at 4 East 79th Street achieved such a victory in September 2024, selling for $56 million, the seventh-highest price fetched for a townhouse in the city\u2019s history. But the property reappeared on the market in November, seeking another peak price.\nThe home, listed by\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Serena Boardman\n, is now asking $68 million, making it one of the most expensive townhouses on the market in the city. Spanning over 15,000 square feet, the 35-foot-wide limestone mansion is again being marketed as a single-family residence, according to a new listing for the property.\nThe seller is American-Irish billionaire John Grayken, who founded distressed debt investor Lone Star Funds and\nserves as chairman of the board\n, sources familiar with the original sale told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe reasons for the re-listing aren\u2019t entirely clear. Grayken, who reportedly\nrenounced his American citizenship\nin 1999 for tax purposes and spends most of his time in London, had bought the home with plans to move in before changing course, sources told\nTRD\n.\nGrayken did not respond to a request for comment and a spokesperson for Lone Star declined to comment.\nBoardman did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe first three floors hold entertaining spaces, including a reception room, living room and formal dining room, and the building features solid mahogany doors and windows, bespoke marble paneling and floors, English brown oak paneling, and parquet de Versailles and herringbone white oak floors, according to the listing.\nThe home is also one of the few in the area with triple exposures due to a small strip of land on its western edge, which allows it to look out onto Central Park through a set of large western windows.\nThe previous owner, the late business magnate Aso Tavitian, bought the home in 1997 and commissioned a gut renovation from architects Peter Pennoyer and Theodore Prudon that was finished in 2004.\nAfter Tavitian died in 2020, his estate listed the home at $65 million in 2023. Boardman had the listing as well.\nThe latest $68 million asking price has raised some eyebrows, given the short turnaround time from when it last sold for $12 million less.\nThe listing states that the house has been \u201cupdated to include all new systems\u201d as of 2025, including \u201csecurity, temperature/humidity, audio, lighting, and AV, as well as a new kitchen, bathrooms, and other changes.\u201d\nBut some brokers expressed skepticism at the new price. \u201cAnybody who can afford that home knows how long that takes,\u201d one agent said of a potential $12 million renovation.\nAnother summed up the name of the game when it comes to finding a buyer and moving a trophy townhouse: \u201call you need is one.\u201d\nTricky trades in the neighborhood\nThe Upper East Side townhouse market has been relatively active this year, driven by a number of homes that cut asking prices before finding a buyer. There have been 63 sales recorded through the end of September this year, up 37 percent from last year, according to a market report from Leslie Garfield.\nBut the average sale price has fallen 23 percent to roughly $9 million, and the average price per square foot has fallen 10 percent to $1,582.\nOne of the other few Gilded Age mansions set up as a single-family at 973 Fifth Avenue\nclosed for $46 million in May\nafter initially asking $80 million in 2021. The home underwent a series of price drops until it found a buyer at its\nfinal asking price of $49.9 million\nin February.\nThe Woolworth Mansion at 4 East 80th Street endured an even longer waiting period, initially hitting the market in 2011 for $90 million. It\nfound a buyer in October\nafter chopping the asking price down to\n$50 million in March\nof this year, closing for $38 million in November.\nAnother Gilded Age manse at 10 East 67th\nsold for $36 million\nin October after originally asking $50 million in 2024.\nBut Grayken can\u2019t be faulted for trying to turn a profit: A\nTRD\nanalysis found that of the 18 houses on the Upper East Side, only three have sold for less than their previous purchase price.\nIn addition to his Upper East Side purchase, Grayken bought a\n$35 million penthouse\nin Boston in 2016, setting a record at the time for the most expensive condo sold in the city.\nGrayken\u2019s firm, Lonestar, has remained active as well,\nraising a $2.7 billion fund in 2024\n. It recently bought a downtown Denver tower for $132.5 million and partnered on the purchase of Fort Lauderdale\u2019s\nBank of America Plaza\nfor $221 million. The firm is also\nreportedly circling a 20-story San Francisco tower\nonce owned by WeWork.",

The grocery chain paid $616 per square foot for the 134,800-square-foot retail plaza, and $32 million above the previous sale price a decade ago.\nAn affiliate of Atlanta-based Jamestown, led by Matt Bronfman, was the buyer. Jamestown paid\n$50.6 million\na decade ago for Polo Club Shops, which was completed in 1988 on 14.2 acres, records show. A Cushman &amp; Wakefield team led by Mark Gilbert and Adam Feinstein represented the seller.\nJamestown completed a major overhaul of the shopping center in 2022, including demolition and reconstruction of the Publix supermarket, which expanded to 48,400 square feet under a 20-year lease.\nPolo Club Shops is 97 percent leased with other tenants including Bolay, AT&amp;T, Chase Bank and The UPS Store.\nThe deal underscores Publix\u2019s strategy in acquiring shopping centers anchored by its supermarkets, giving the company more control over its sites and rental income from neighboring tenants.\nThe Polo Club Shops purchase comes just two months after Publix paid\n$71.9 million\nfor Hammocks Town Center in Kendall, an unincorporated neighborhood in southwest Miami-Dade County. The 207,500-square-foot shopping center is anchored by a Publix store. That acquisition did not include five outparcels separately owned by other entities such as Bank of America and McDonald\u2019s.\nIncluding Polo Club Shops, Publix has spent nearly $428 million since May of last year acquiring a standalone store and eight Publix-anchored shopping centers across South Florida. Previous purchases include retail sites in Coral Springs, Davie, Lake Worth Beach and Royal Palm Beach, as well as $40 million for a\nNorth Miami strip mall\nand $25 million for a property adjacent to the\nGaleria Fort Lauderdale\nmall.",

        "content": "Dalian Wanda Group, an early co-developer of the St. Regis Chicago, sold a group of condos at the downtown high-rise.\nProperty records show the Chinese conglomerate sold the units at the 101-story skyscraper at 363 East Wacker Drive for $47.5 million. Completed in 2020, the building has 393 units, along with a 192-key hotel operated by Marriott International.\nWang Jianlin\u2019s Wanda Group owned 37 condos in the building and had previously\nmarketed them as a bulk sale\n. It\u2019s not clear whether the sale included all 37 units or only a portion of them. For the full group, the sale price would come out to $1.3 million per unit.\nThe sale price and the buyer and seller were recorded in a state database of property transfers, but\nThe Real Deal\nwas not able to obtain the deed with additional details. Wanda Group could not be reached for comment.\nThe buyer of the condos is listed as CPE Stage Investments in state records. CPE is the name of a Chinese investment firm, previously known as CITIC Private Equity, but\nTRD\nwas not able to confirm the buyer\u2019s identity.\nWanda Group put up the group of condos for sale in March, originally tapping Newmark to market the properties. Chuck Johanns of Newmark said the firm was not involved in the final sale.\nThe bulk offering included five one-bedroom units, five two-bedrooms, 18 three-bedrooms, five four-bedrooms and four penthouses. The condos were never listed for sale individually before being put up as a group.\nWanda originally invested in the Jeanne Gang-designed skyscraper in 2016 alongside Chicago-based Magellan Development Group, intending to use the building for its first U.S.-based hotel under the Wanda Vista brand. After China\ntightened regulations on overseas investments\n, Wanda sold its 90 percent stake in the building to Magellan in 2020 for $270 million.\nThe bulk sale comes a year after Magellan\nsold its remaining 84 units\nto Denver-based GD Holdings, the real estate arm of Mexican clothing company Grupo Denim. Those condos sold for $117 million, about $3.2 million per unit.\nThe St. Regis has picked up momentum this year after a long slump in the downtown condo market. A\n79th-floor penthouse sold\nfor $7.5 million in September. In October, Siri co-founder Dag Kittlaus bought an 84th-floor penthouse there for $9.25 million, property records show.\nBoth purchases came from GD Holdings\u2019 portfolio, and at least five more GD Holdings units have sold for more than $5 million each this year, property records show.\nIn 2022, Mexican mining CEO German Larrea purchased a two-story, 10,000-square-foot penthouse spanning the 71st and 72nd floors\nfor $20 million\n, the priciest sale on record at the building. Other notable sales include the 76th-floor unit that sold for\n$8.3 million in 2025\n, the\n91st floor that sold for $9.2\nmillion and the\n87th floor that sold for $9 million\n, both in 2022.\nThe 78th floor penthouse\nsold for $7 million in 2024\n, a loss for the sellers who purchased it at $8.2 million.\n",

        "content": "A major Chicago-based apartment owner just made one of the city\u2019s biggest real estate bets of the year.\nAmli Residential paid more than $134 million for\nMilieu\n, a 19-story, 275-unit apartment tower at 205 South Peoria Street in the West Loop, according to property records. The deal ranks among the four largest transactions in Chicago so far this year, Costar\nreported\n.\nPacific Life Insurance sold the tower that was built in 2019. Pacific Life developed the project along with White Oak Realty Partners and Crayton Advisors. Pacific Life later bought out its partners and financed the property with an $86 million loan in 2021, Cook County records show.\nThe purchase adds to an already active year for Chicago\u2019s apartment investment market. After a pandemic-era lull, landlords have been testing the waters as construction completions slow and rents in Chicago\ncontinue to outperform\nmost major U.S. markets that were hit harder by overbuilding. Before the Milieu deal, investors had already poured roughly $4.5 billion into Chicago-area multifamily properties in 2025, according to Costar data, more than any full-year total since 2022.\nMilieu sits in a West Loop neighborhood that has become one of the city\u2019s most competitive submarkets, buoyed by office conversions, uptick in the dining scene and proximity to Fulton Market. The building includes 215 parking spaces, a rooftop pool and deck and a full slate of amenities. When JLL brought the property to market in July, occupancy stood at 96 percent, with new leases signed att 5 percent rent increases, year-to-date, according to marketing materials.\nThe Milieu sale trails only a handful of blockbuster deals this year. The largest was the $175 million sale of the 398-unit\nNorth Water Apartments\nin November, the city\u2019s priciest transaction since 2023. Other notable trades include the $170 million sale of the 375-unit\nFulbrix tower\nin Fulton Market, and the $151 million deal for the 451-unit\nLeft Bank apartments\nat 300 North Canal Street.\nAmli was founded in 1980 by Denver-based real estate executive Bob Mutz and Chicago attorney John Allen. It went public in the 1990s and was taken private in a $2.1 billion deal by Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investing in 2006. Today, Amli remains a Morgan Stanley subsidiary with more than 25,000 units across eight U.S. markets.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

An affiliate of Pacific Realty Associates sold the 7-acre property.\nThe business park, known as Pactrust Business Center South, totals 95,000 square feet of offices across seven buildings. Tenants at the site include software company Hawk Ridge Systems, laser makers Lighthouse Photonics and 3D-Micromac America, and medical technology manufacturers Cephasonics and EchoPixel.\nKayne Anderson\u2019s purchase marks the latest property acquisition in the region for the alternative investment management firm.

Earlier this month, an affiliate of Menlo Park Equities proposed turning an office and research building at 300 Holger Way into a 97,800-square-foot data center. The structure has been\nleased by Nvidia\nsince late last year.\nIn October, a\nGoodman Group affiliate bought\na site in north San Jose with plans for a data center.

LBA floated building a tech village with offices, shops, restaurants and a hotel there in 2019, changing course three years later with a proposal for an advanced manufacturing facility, though that project never got off the ground. It submitted a development permit to the city of San Jose earlier this year to build a 207,950-square-foot data center instead.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "Get your bids ready.\nCharles Cohen\u2019s 750 Lexington Avenue\nis set to be auctioned off next month.\nThe auction is the\nresult of a foreclosure lawsuit\nfacing the billionaire behind Cohen Brothers Realty. In a judgment entered earlier this month, a state court ordered the 31-story office building to be foreclosed upon and sold to pay off a $155.9 million loan balance.\nThe sale is scheduled for January 21 at 2:15 pm at the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, according to Joshua Stein, the referee for the auction. The buyer will be entitled to the leasehold on the property as well as the borrower\u2019s interest in the underlying land.\nThe building at 750 Lexington is one of Cohen Brothers\u2019 legacy properties, developed by the family in the 1980s and the site of the company\u2019s office. A borrower connected to Cohen took out $130 million on the leasehold in 2015.\nBut trouble began just a few years later. Tenants began vacating during the pandemic as Cohen fell behind on payments, according to information from Morningstar Credit. In 2023, beleaguered coworking company WeWork stopped paying rent. When the company declared bankruptcy, Cohen negotiated a lease amendment.\nBut the most recent net operating income reported by the property was just $1.8 million in 12 months, a drop of about 86 percent since the loan was underwritten. The appraised value of the property has fallen by a similar percentage in that time, from\n$300 million to $41 million\n, according to Morningstar. Debt service has been more than annual net operating income since 2021.\nIn 2024, the loan\u2019s special servicer launched a foreclosure suit, accusing the borrower of falling behind on taxes and financial statements. The lender also accused Cohen, who served as a limited guarantor on the loan, of failing to submit documents showing his net worth and liquidity.\nIn July, a judge\nawarded the lender a summary judgment\n. The borrower now owes $155.9 million, according to court documents, nearly $25 million more than the original loan.\nAttorneys for the borrower and for Cohen Brothers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe office tower is the latest to be lost or sold by Cohen\u2019s entities. Last year he was ordered to pay lender Fortress Credit $187 million after a down-and-out court battle related to loan defaults. In an effort to pay off that judgment, Cohen has been\nmarketing his buildings\n. In August, Vornado Realty Trust announced it would\nbuy 623 Fifth Avenue\nfor $218 million. Cohen also agreed to sell\n3 East 54th Street\nto a mystery buyer for $188 million.\n",

But today the building is about half empty, making it a strong candidate for a residential conversion.\nBushburg is already at work on one of the city\u2019s largest conversion projects nearby at 80 Pine Street, which the developer is turning into\nmore than 700 apartments\n.\nRepresentatives for Bushburg and Manulife could not be immediately reached for comment. An Eastdil Secured team led by Will Silverman and Gary Phillips negotiated the sale.\nManulife, Canada\u2019s largest insurer, bought the Emery Roth-designed building in 2013 from Japanese property developer Mitsui Fudosan.\nIt was a time when, similar to today, many office buildings in the Financial District were being converted into residential, which helped improve fundamentals for the remaining commercial properties in the area.\n\u201cThere\u2019s quite a bit of activity right now converting Class-A offices in the financial district into residential,\u201d Manulife chief investment officer\nWarren Thomson\ntold Bloomberg at the time of the purchase. \u201cThose conversions start to reduce the supply. We think it\u2019s going to be an interesting market for commercial rates. There should be some good pricing over time.\u201d\nIndeed, Lower Manhattan\u2019s office market improved through the 2010s and much of the conversion activity ceased.\nBut in the wake of the pandemic, many office buildings have struggled, and enterprising developers have snapped up properties at bargain prices for conversions.\nBushburg last year bought the 1.2 million-square-foot building at 80 Pine Street from Rudin for $160 million. The 40-story office tower was about half empty, and Hoffman\u2019s company quickly got started working on converting floors 2 through 17 into 713 rental apartments.\nBushburg this summer landed a $320 million construction loan for the project from\nBridge City Capital\nand Deutsche Bank.\n",

Each monitor will report to the Commission every three months, providing updates on the teams\u2019 progress in delivering on the various pledges they made to secure approval.\nCommission Chair Brian O\u2019Dwyer confirmed that this includes promises that the teams made both formally in their applications, as well as those made publicly but left out of official paperwork. He said failing to live up to these promises could result in a team losing its license.\nWith that in mind, here\u2019s a refresher on some of the promises the casino teams made:\nMetropolitan Park ($5.3 billion capital investment)\n\u2014\n$1 billion in community benefits, which includes a $163 million community impact fund and $50 million for local health, youth and senior services\n\u2014 25 acres of new park space\n\u2014 450 affordable apartments offsite on a parking lot in Corona (in\npartnership\nwith Slate Property Group)\n\u2014 Development of the Flushing SkyPark and a new pedestrian bridge (which were\ncritical\nin gaining key legislative support)\n\u2014 $60 million for a Taste of Queens food hall as part of one of the facility\u2019s parking garages\nBally\u2019s ($2.3 billion capital investment)\n\u2014 70 percent of construction and facility jobs will go to Bronx residents (the company is projecting 15,000 construction jobs, nearly 4,000 permanent positions)\n\u2014 Annual contribution of 1 percent of gross gaming revenue (minimum of $15 million) to a community benefits fund, starting when the gaming facility opens\n\u2014 Overall pledge of $625 million in community benefits, including $100 million for parkland improvements and the revitalization of Ferry Point Park, $75 million for transportation upgrades and\u00a0$10 million for new NYPD substations and increased police presence in the area\n\u2014\u00a0An equity ownership initiative where local residents can buy an equity interest in the project, creating an up to 9 percent community ownership stake\nResorts World ($3.3 billion capital investment)\n\u2014 For the duration of its license, annual contributions of the lesser of: 2 percent of incremental gross gaming revenue above 2025 levels, or $25 million per year, for a workforce housing fund (this is part of a partnership with Cirrus Real Estate, which is projected to result in up to 50,000 workforce housing units being built citywide)\n\u2014\u00a0An initial $25 million for its Resorts World Gives program, with up to $5 million each year after that\n\u2014\u00a0An initial $50 million investment in the \u201cdesign and preconstruction programming\u201d of an \u201cInnovation Campus\u201d on Rockaway Boulevard (annual contributions after that will be the lesser of 2 percent of incremental gross gaming revenue above 2025 levels or $25 million)\n\u2014\u00a0$100 million for infrastructure improvements\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat do you think about the\nhousing-related\nCity Council bills potentially heading to a vote this week?

My colleague Emma Whalen\nbroke down\nwhat the ordinance meant for the deal (which did not result in tenants buying the building).\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\nThe MTA plans to spend $7.3 million on installing turnstile paddles and spikes at nearly every subway station,\nGothamist reports\n.

The City of Los Angeles pays for these efforts using\nFederal Emergency Management Agency\nand Office of Emergency Services funds managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\u201cNearly a year after the fire, 99.8 percent of the Palisades burn zone has been cleared, yet these remaining properties are still sitting in toxic limbo, and that is unacceptable,\u201d Park said. \u201cThe community did everything right, the city did everything it could within its authority, and yet a handful of owners have allowed hazardous debris to remain despite repeated notices and a formal nuisance abatement.\u201d\nThe goal, Park said, is to \u201cidentify funding so we can step in, clean these sites ourselves, and finally move recovery forward.\u201d\nThe properties in question were abated and declared public nuisances in October. Those sites include the\nPacific Palisades Bowl Mobile Home Park\nand the remains of a\nmansion featured on HBO\u2019s \u201cSuccession\u201d\ncontaining hazardous waste. As of mid-October 2025, debris removal had been completed on 4,487 of the parcels charred by the fire, leaving 11 sites uncleared.\nOn the other side of town, cleanup efforts following the Eaton fire wrapped several months ago. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\ncompleted debris removal\nin Altadena and the surrounding area in August.\nIf the motion is approved in committee, it would advance to the full city council for a final greenlight.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A multifamily mega-sale is taking shape in Chicago.\nDenver-based Apartment Investment and Management Company, better known as Aimco, is selling its portfolio of seven rental complexes across the Chicago area for $455 million.\nLaTerra Capital, based in Marina Del Ray, California, and Respark Residential, based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, are buying the properties, Aimco announced Monday. The deal amounts to a sale of all Aimco\u2019s Chicago-area apartment buildings as the company looks to wind down entirely.\nThe transaction would be among the largest in Chicago this year.\nThe buyers have completed due diligence and agreed to provide a non-refundable deposit that will total $20 million by January 15. Closing is scheduled for the first quarter of 2026, according to Aimco.\nLaTerra and Respark plan to assume the properties\u2019 current loans, a news release said.\nThe sale is part of Aimco\u2019s\nliquidation process\nwhich began in November. As of last month, the operator had 15 properties left to sell while it ceased operations.\nThe $455 million transaction will come out to about $304,000 per unit. The buyers are coming to the market at an advantageous time. The Chicago area has notched\nsome of the strongest rent growth in the country\nthis year.\nFactoring in debt and transaction costs, net proceeds for Aimco from the Chicago portfolio sale are expected to land at $160 million, the release stated.\nThe seven Chicago-area properties included in the sale to LaTerra and Respark are the following:\nHyde Park Tower\n5140 South Hyde Park Boulevard, Chicago\nElm Creek Apartments\n1 Elm Creek Drive, Elmhurst\nEldridge Townhomes\n1 Elm Creek Drive, Elmhurst\nWillow Bend Apartment Homes\n2850 Southampton Drive, Rolling Meadows\nEvanston Place Apartments\n1715 Chicago Avenue, Evanston,\nYorktown Apartment Homes\n2233 South Highland Avenue, Lombard\n2200 Grace Apartments\n2200 South Grace Street, Lombard\nAimco finalized plans to sell off all of its assets across the country last month. The decision was the conclusion of a nearly year-long saga that began after the firm started a strategic review of options in January.\nThe review process involved Aimco speaking with more than 100 firms, including financial sponsors, investment managers, public real estate investment trusts and private real estate firms. This year alone, the company saw a 1.9 percent decline in property net operating income compared to last year; at the same time, property expenses increased 1.1 percent and average occupancy fell from the prior quarter to 94.8 percent.\nAimco has lost more than 30 percent of its stock value this year. The decline in stock price matches up with the value distributed via dividends of $2.83 per share.\nAt the end of September, it had $404 million in cash on hand and $748M in debt, including mortgages backing properties.\nRecent Aimco sales include a deal in August\nto sell five New England residential communities\nto Harbor Group International for $740 million. It\u2019s also under contract to sell\na multifamily and office assemblage on the Miami waterfront\nfor $520 million; that deal is set to close next month in what would be a record sale for the seaside city.\n",

        "content": "Fannie Mae\u2019s move to foreclose on a nine-property portfolio on the South Side of Chicago is shedding light on real estate deals with ties to an\nEast Coast hotspot\nfor commercial mortgage fraud.\nThe government-backed mortgage company alleges in Cook County Circuit Court that the property sales are linked to investor Israel Bialostozky, and his company is in default on an $18 million loan tied to the buildings in the Chatham, Englewood, South Chicago and Brainerd neighborhoods.\nThe Fannie Mae foreclosure follows Bialostozky\u2019s 2023 purchase of the underlying real estate from a Lakewood, New Jersey-based investor named Chaim Joseph Bialostozky, public records show.\nFannie\u2019s foreclosure suit involves a total of 291 apartments across the nine-property portfolio.\nTwo companies, Gray Portfolio Investment 1 and Gray Portfolio Holdings, both tied to investors with the last names of Bialostozky, were involved in the building sales in 2023 that preceded the foreclosure, records show.\nThe latter company is linked to\nChaim Bialostozky\nof Lakewood, New Jersey. The firm sold the nine-building portfolio to the current owner, the company managed by Israel Bialostozky, for $24 million in 2023, according to public property records.\nThat sale came after Chaim Bialostozky purchased the real estate in 2022 through a series of deals. The sellers in those deals were Lakewood-based LLCs, almost all of which were managed by people (or perhaps the same person) named Avraham Levin, Yaakov Levin, or Avraham Yaakov Levin, for a total of more than $22 million, records show. (Several other Lakewood-based investors who have faced distress have interchangeably used first and middle names on Chicago property documents.)\nChaim Bialostozky\u2019s LLC soon racked up building code violation complaints from the city of Chicago on the properties. As of July, the city of Chicago was still claiming that a Joseph Bialostozky \u2014 a name Chaim also appears to be called, according to public records showing his ties to the same\nLakewood\naddress \u2014 still owed over $34,000 for failure to pay debts owed to the city stemming from building code violation court orders. According to public records, those issues, tied to 7851 South Avalon Avenue and 1234 East 79th Street, remain unresolved.\nThe portfolio\u2019s current owner, the LLC managed by Israel Bialostozky, triggered Fannie\u2019s foreclosure lawsuit by allegedly \u201cfailing to maintain and repair the property, failing to keep the property in good repair and marketable condition, and failing to promptly repair damaged parts of the property,\u201d the lender\u2019s complaint said. The fact the city is pursuing code enforcement violations against the landlord constitutes another default of the loan agreement, the records show.\nIt\u2019s unusual for building code violations to trigger lender foreclosure actions, though such lawsuits tend to be filed when property conditions are particularly dire. Furthermore, Israel Bialostozky has been accused of failing to deposit more than $3.8 million into a lender-controlled account meant to address \u201csubstantial deficiencies in the physical conditions of the property.\u201d He was supposed to deposit the funds in February, the lawsuit shows.\nAside from Fannie Mae\u2019s foreclosure lawsuit against the Gray Portfolio properties, nearly 300 additional Chicago apartments are still owned by LLCs held by Chaim Bialostozky that he purchased from Levin, property records show. Chaim Bialostozky\u2019s portfolio once totaled nearly 600 units, before he sold the buildings now facing foreclosure to Israel Bialostozky.\nChaim Bialostozky used a $17.6 million Fannie-backed loan provided by New York-based\nArbor Realty\nto buy the nine properties from Levin for $22 million in 2022 that are now facing foreclosure. Then the next year, Israel Bialostozky used a $17.8 million Fannie loan provided by Greystone to support his purchase of the same nine buildings from Chaim Bialostozky, which was recorded as a $24 million sale, records show.\nIsrael Bialostozky paid a higher price, despite building code violations also emerging at his buildings shortly after buying them, records show.\nIt\u2019s unclear if the Bialostozkys are related, though public record databases show they have shared the same Lakewood address.\nIsrael Bialostozky didn\u2019t return multiple emails requesting comment, and Fannie Mae didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\nRegardless, the transfers and their rising valuations, despite the emergence of city building code enforcement action \u2014\u00a0and an apparent lack of building permit and construction activity in between the sales \u2014 combine to raise concerns about the nature of the relationships between the recent buyers and sellers of these properties.\nLawsuits follow Bialostozky\nLakewood has become a nexus for investors who bought commercial properties in\nChicago and throughout the Midwest\n, and then rapidly flipped them, sometimes between related parties, allegedly in order to load up buildings with loans well above assessed values and own real estate with no money down. Neither Bialostozky has been accused of criminal wrongdoing.\nChaim Bialostozky appears to have been in the same orbit as\nMark Nussbaum\n\u2014 the New York real estate attorney now under indictment for suspected grand larceny tied to allegedly missing escrow funds. Deals tied to Nussbaum and his Chicago partners used\nrapid flips and unusual financing\nto extract outsized loans against modest buildings, records show.\nIn an alternative bankruptcy proceeding, Nussbaum recently listed a\nJ. Bialostozky as a debtor\nwho owes the indicted lawyer over $1.2 million (Chaim Bialostozky is also known as Joseph, according to active litigation involving the Lakewood-based investor). Other borrowers with Lakewood ties who have faced pressure from lenders \u2014 such as\nShaya Prager\n, who has been plagued by commercial property distress across the nation, including suburban Chicago\u00a0\u2014 were also listed by Nussbaum as debtors.\nEarlier this year, an entity called Mount Dora sued Nussbaum\u2019s former firm, Nussbaum Lowinger \u2014 which has since been shut down \u2014 claiming the firm executed fraudulent transfers involving Chaim Bialostozky to avoid paying a judgment.\nThe dispute was over a $6.15 million judgment Mount Dora was awarded in 2022 against Timothy Majors and Hobart Investments in Florida. The Mount Dora entity was seeking to collect $2.9 million. Furthermore, the lawsuit alleged that Majors was involved in the 2022 sale of properties in Bradenton and Daytona Beach, Florida, to Dr. Harry Nyanteh and an affiliate of Lakewood investor Chaim Bialostozky.\nA Majors-controlled company has since filed a separate lawsuit against Chaim Bialostozky and an entity called Gray Portfolio 2 LLC over Florida real estate disputes. Bialostozky is seeking to have the case dismissed and has denied that he improperly took funds that Majors is seeking. That case is still pending in a Delaware court.\nBack in Chicago, Fannie Mae is seeking to have the court appoint\nMatthew Tarshis of Frontline Real Estate Partners\nas a receiver for the nine-property portfolio. Fannie has said it doesn\u2019t offer to accept title to the real estate to satisfy Israel Bialostozky\u2019s firm\u2019s debt.\n",

The concept leans heavily on Jordan\u2019s legacy of excellence without using his name, inviting visitors to \u201cexperience greatness\u201d through programming centered on mindset, action and service, according to the application.\nCooper\u2019s new proposal follows a\nSeptember setback\n, when the Highland Park City Council blocked his initial plan to sell million-dollar shares in the property through a\nfractional ownership\nsetup. Officials amended the zoning code to ban timeshares in single-family homes, a move aimed squarely at Cooper\u2019s idea. The estate is also listed as a conventional rental for $89,000 a month with a nine-month minimum.\nThe revised vision still requires zoning relief. City staff said Cooper is requesting \u201ca new type of land use\u201d that would allow the home to operate as a tourist destination, offering tours and access to amenities like the indoor basketball court and pool. The discussion is scheduled before the council as a committee of the whole, meaning no vote is expected.\nA key piece is a proposed partnership with the neighboring\nHeller Nature Center\n, a 97-acre park district property that borders the estate. Cooper\u2019s plan would shuttle visitors to Heller\u2019s parking lot and funnel them along existing trails to the house, a move aimed at reducing traffic on Point Lane, a quiet cul-de-sac with just seven homes.\nThe proposal also calls for moving the iconic No. 23 displayed on the front gate to an interior spot, another nod to neighbors\u2019 concerns. Cooper said he also wants to launch a nonprofit, Champions Legacy, focused on youth programming, though it\u2019s unclear how that would affect the property\u2019s tax status. The estate\u2019s annual tax bill is about $138,000.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A stalled\nEast Austin mixed-use project\nis back in business.\nLV Collective, an Austin-based multifamily developer with a specialty in student housing, plans to start construction on the 476-unit project at 2700 East Fifth Street in June, according to a Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation filing.\nNewly named The Right Angle, the wedge-shaped building will occupy a triangular plot between Fifth Street, Pleasant Valley Road and the Austin Area Terminal Railroad. The project has an estimated cost of $106 million and is slated for completion in September 2028, the filing shows.\nLV Collective, formerly known as Lincoln Ventures, previously planned a mixed-use project with more units and a higher construction cost at the same site.\nThe company acquired the 4.3-acre plot in 2021, according to county records, and soon thereafter\nannounced plans for a mixed-use community\nthat would include townhouses, duplexes, two levels of co-working space, a grocery store and 625 residential rental units. Billed amenities included a pet spa and a catering kitchen. The original construction cost was almost $134 million. LV had hoped to finish the project by the summer of 2024.\nThe updated project will still be mixed-use, according to Colby Wallis, the firm\u2019s construction and development vice president. The number of townhomes and duplexes hasn\u2019t been specified.\nLV Collective is best known for\nMoontower\n, Waterloo and other student housing developments in Austin. LV also built the\nPaseo\n, a high-rise at 80 Rainey Street.\nDallas firm WDG Architecture will design The Right Angle project, according to the TDLR filing.\nAustin is recovering from a\nmultifamily building spree\nthat drove occupancy and rents down. Multifamily developers completed about 16,000 units last year, suppressing rents by about 5 percent compared to 2023.\nLV Collective CEO David Kanne couldn\u2019t be reached to elaborate on the reduced plan for The Right Angle, but he said\nearlier this year\nthat grocery, retail and office developments would meet a stronger demand than a strictly residential rental development.",

        "content": "Two prime redevelopment sites on the eastern edge of downtown Austin are stirring fresh speculation about what could rise next \u2014 and how dramatically they could reshape a fast-changing stretch near I-35.\nThe most visible question mark sits where the Frank Erwin Center once stood. Bulldozers wiped the drum-shaped arena from Austin\u2019s skyline last year, leaving a fenced-off, 19-acre site north of 15th Street on Red River at 1701 Red River Street. The land was long expected to host the future UT Medical Center, a joint effort between the University of Texas at Austin and MD Anderson Cancer Center,\naccording\nto the Austin Business Journal.\nThat plan is no longer a lock. The UT System\u2019s board of regents is now weighing an alternative site near\nThe Domain\nin North Austin, raising the prospect that the\nErwin Center\nparcel could be redeployed for something else entirely. UT System\u2019s board chairman, Kevin Eltife, said in November that the system is looking for a larger canvas to build \u201ca district for the future,\u201d language that has only amplified uncertainty about the downtown site\u2019s fate.\nWith the hospital no longer guaranteed, sources say the Erwin Center land could accommodate a range of uses, from academic and research facilities to civic or cultural projects. The site\u2019s scale, proximity to downtown and to I-35 make it one of the most consequential redevelopment opportunities in the urban core, even as highway expansion and infrastructure constraints complicate development.\nJust south of the Erwin site, another major property is quietly being teed up. Austin City Council approved a rezoning this month for the former Teacher Retirement System of Texas headquarters at 1000 Red River Street, clearing the way for a uniform downtown mixed-use designation across the 4-acre block, the Journal\nreported\n. City documents say the change allows office, residential, commercial and life sciences uses and removes regulatory friction that had limited redevelopment.\nAustin Real Estate Acquisitions LLC, which shares an address with life sciences-focused developer\nAlexandria Real Estate Equities\n, a Pasadena-based REIT, acquired the property in 2022 for $108 million. While the owner has not disclosed specific plans, local business groups have been told the site could support medical or life sciences uses that complement Dell Medical School and the nearby Innovation Tower.\nTogether, the two sites sit at the nexus of multiple megaprojects: the I-35 expansion, the planned redevelopment of the\nAustin Convention Center\n, the buildout of Waterloo Greenway and UT\u2019s forthcoming multipurpose arena north of Erwin Center.\nMarket realities will matter. Office development remains a tough sell in Austin, where vacancy hovered above 26 percent in the third quarter, and millions of square feet remain available. UT\u2019s own Innovation Tower, completed in 2022, is still largely unleased, highlighting the challenge of launching new office buildings without surrounding amenities.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "\u201cSometimes I get the urge to exercise,\u201d the famously rotund basketball coach Frank Layden once said, \u201cbut I lie down and it passes.\u201d\nSometimes I get the urge to write about good things happening in real estate. But I think for a moment and it passes. There is just too much foolishness going on.\nToday\u2019s example comes from Long Island\u2019s North Fork.\nWe\u2019ll start with the good news. Nearly every hospitality site on this bucolic peninsula has been upgraded in recent years.\nLongtime owners and\nnew investors\n\u2014 mom-and-pops, private equity funds, even the magnate\nStefan Soloviev\n\u2014 are capitalizing on strong demand to visit the North Fork, which stretches from Riverhead to Orient Point, opposite the Hamptons.\nThe supply of hotel rooms, however, is still tight enough that some venues can charge more than $1,000 a night during the summer. Investors are trying to add more. The problem is, locals make it exceedingly difficult.\nBetween an open space preservation tax and residential zoning, good sites for commercial development are hard to find. And when you do find one, community opposition is a given. Fears of\nHamptonization\n, traffic and changes in the North Fork\u2019s character often prevail.\nAmid this dynamic, a large, potentially glorious piece of land on the Gardiners Bay waterfront has sat moribund for decades. The 18-acre \u201cOki-Do\u201d site in East Marion is perhaps the worst eyesore on the North Fork, thanks to an abandoned oyster processing plant \u2014 a hulking, hideous mass of crumbling concrete surrounded by an ugly fence.\nAn old smokestack completes the pathetic picture.\nVarious plans to redevelop it have not come to fruition. One called for 114 hotel rooms, two dozen rental cottages, two restaurants, an amphitheater and a marina.\nThe latest was from homebuilder Paramount Hamptons and Sal DeLorenzo, who snapped up the land in October 2021 for $6 million and\nannounced plans\nfor 80 condominium units.\nParamount tapped Steven Losquadro, whom Newsday recently described as a \u201c\nconnected Suffolk lawyer\n,\u201d to pitch this plan for quiet Shipyard Lane.\nAs if to make his task even more challenging, Losquadro mentioned workforce housing. Reality check: That is something Long Islanders support in the abstract but rarely in an actual project.\nAn East Marion civic group polled residents and reported that more than 80 percent opposed affordable housing at the Oki-Do site. The town supervisor persuaded the town board in 2022 to change the zoning to attract a hotel and restaurant, but Paramount\u2019s Bill Locantro said he builds homes,\nnot eateries and hotels\n.\nShipyard Lane residents, for their part, said traffic from either project would damage their quality of life. Mind you, this is a dead-end street with more deer than vehicles on most days.\nPut all these ingredients together and you have a recipe for inertia.\nFrom what I can tell, Paramount Homes has not been heard from since. Unfortunately, while the cat was away, the mice came out to play: Southold Town is in the process of changing the site\u2019s zoning from marine to large-lot residential, as the NIMBY neighbors wanted.\nInstead of a classy waterfront hotel and restaurant, the rezoning would allow for a few McMansions, rendering this stretch of waterfront the private domain of second-home owners.\nThat\u2019s the best-case scenario. The worst case is that large-lot zoning so devalues the site that clearing it, remediating any pollution and building houses wouldn\u2019t pencil out. The eyesore would remain for another generation.\n",

        "content": "A long-shuttered legacy hotel in Addison is getting a second life, aiming to appeal to the small town\u2019s businesses and tourists.\nA top-to-bottom renovation by Mehrdad Moayedi\u2019s Centurion American Development Group is nearly complete at the former Crowne Plaza at 14315 Midway Road, rebranding the 426-room property as Hotel Dax. The project will have nearly 32,000 square feet of redesigned meeting space, four new dining concepts, a resort-style pool and a TopGolf Swing Suite, positioning the hotel as a business-and-leisure hybrid aimed at both visitors and locals, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nAn LLC affiliated with\nCenturion\nacquired the property in August, and the hotel is expected to open early next year. The investment marks one of the more significant hospitality upgrades in\nAddison\n, a town of roughly 18,000 known for its dense concentration of restaurants and steady corporate traffic.\nMoayedi\nsaid in a statement that there is demand for higher-quality meeting and event space in Addison, and that Hotel Dax is meant to add options to the town.\nWhile Centurion is best known for master-planned residential communities \u2014 including massive developments underway in Fort Worth, Gunter and Denison \u2014 the firm has a track record with high-profile hotel redevelopments. Most notably, it spearheaded the $255 million restoration of downtown Dallas\u2019 Statler Hotel, reopening the 1950s landmark in 2017 as a luxury, midcentury-inspired destination.\nThe Addison project required a similarly heavy lift. The Crowne Plaza closed in April 2020 amid financial strain and mounting repair costs tied to weather damage. Built in 1984 and renovated as recently as 2013, the hotel previously earned InterContinental Hotels Group\u2019s \u201crenovation of the year\u201d award prior to its decline. Before its Crowne Plaza branding, the property operated as a Harvey Hotel.\nThis time, Centurion gutted the interior entirely, according to a company spokesperson, while keeping the building\u2019s exterior structure largely intact, including its signature glass ceiling. Dallas-based\nMerriman Anderson Architects\nled the interior redesign, and Dreamscape Hospitality will manage the hotel.\nThe new food-and-beverage lineup is central to the repositioning. Concepts include Top Brass, an American bistro with Southern influences; Bar Dax, a social and sports bar; an outdoor pool lounge open to locals as well as for private events; and Brewed, a coffee shop and grab-and-go market. The hotel is also participating in Marriott Bonvoy, tying it into the brand\u2019s global loyalty network.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Three developers with plans to add 1,600 multifamily units to Miami, including some workforce apartments through the Live Local Act, are headed to a city projects review board.\nNamdar Group and Helm Equities each propose a\nLive Local Act\nproject, and Crescent Heights wants to continue its development in Edgewater. Miami\u2019s Urban Development Review Board will vote on the projects on Wednesday.\nThe proposals show an\nunceasing bet\non the Magic City\u2019s rental market, despite a\nsupply overhang\nthat\u2019s gripped South Florida over the past two years following record completions and a slowdown of the influx of out-of-staters. This has all led to slower lease-ups and increased concessions, casting doubt about how the hefty pipeline will fare once it\u2019s completed.\nDevelopers have countered that demand will catch up once they finish their towers, and that they are carefully picking their submarkets to ensure the areas aren\u2019t over-supplied.\nHere\u2019s what the board will consider this week.\nNamdar\u2019s second Magic City bet\nIn the biggest project on the agenda, Great Neck, New York-based\nNamdar Group\nproposes a 42-story Live Local Act tower with 1,011 units in Brickell. It would mark Namdar\u2019s second multifamily project in Miami.\nDesigned by Behar Font &amp; Partners, the tower will include 405 apartments reserved for households earning no more than 120 percent of the area median income. That\u2019s in line with the Live Local Act\u2019s requirement that 40 percent of units are at workforce or affordable rents.\nIt would rise on the vacant 1.03-acre site at 250 and 296 Southwest Seventh Street.\nNamdar, led by Ephraim and Joel Namdar, is asking the city to allow 599 micro-units, which under the city code are to range from 275 square feet to up to 400 square feet.\nThe Live Local Act, a state law approved in 2023 and tweaked in the subsequent two years, allows developers to build up to the biggest density allowed in a jurisdiction and up to the tallest height permitted within a mile as long as they designate 40 percent of units for households earning 120 percent of the AMI or less.\nNamdar isn\u2019t maximizing its development potential, as its project is smaller than the 48 stories and 1,030 units the act allows on its site, according to the firm\u2019s application.\nBaywood Hotels owns the site, records show.\nElsewhere in Brickell, Namdar is developing a pair of multifamily towers with\n1,400 units\ncombined. The firm is expected to complete Phase I with a 43-story, 680-unit tower at 55 Northeast Second Street early next year. In September, Namdar started construction of Phase II\u00a0 with a 43-story, 714-unit tower at 50 Northeast Third Street, which is expected to be completed in 2028.\nHelm plans workforce rentals in lux district\nHelm Equities, an affiliate of New York-based JEMB Realty, tweaked its proposal for a\nLive Local Act\nproject in the Miami Design District.\nThe district, largely developed by Miami Design District Associates, has a reputation as Miami\u2019s top destination for luxury retailers.\nThe firm proposes a 36-story, 278-unit multifamily tower and an adjacent eight-story building with about 101,400 square feet of office space, according to its application.\nDesigned by Cube 3, the project also will have more than 56,400 square feet of retail; a 613-space underground garage; 6,200 square feet of open space; and 13,700 square feet of civic space.\nThe proposal is for the 1.9-acre property at 220 Northeast 43rd Street, a site Helm has owned since 2014. It\u2019s tweaked its proposal several times, most recently planning a six-story, 80,000-square-foot office building. Its\nrecent plan\nalso was for a Live Local Act project.\nThe Gindhi family is a limited partner in the project.\nCrescent\u2019s big bet on Edgewater\nCrescent Heights is making good on its promise to develop its 9-acre holdings in Miami\u2019s\nEdgewater\n.\nThe Miami-based firm \u2013\u2013 led by Sonny Kahn, Russell Galbut and Bruce Menin \u2013\u2013 proposes a 42-story, 360-unit multifamily building and an adjacent six-story commercial building with retail and office uses. The development site at 200 Northeast 30th Street is next to Crescent\u2019s 40-story, 588-unit\nForma\napartment tower, which the firm completed last year.\nForma, which offers one-bedroom and two-bedroom units, commands monthly rents ranging from $3,565 to $7,515, its website shows. It was 97 percent leased as of October, Galbut said at the time.\nDesigned by Arquitectonica, the project is essentially the second phase of Forma and will include two pedestrian bridges connecting the 42-story tower to Forma and to the six-story commercial building, the plans show.\n",

        "content": "The standoff between Chicago\u2019s MLS and Zillow is escalating, as Zillow looks prepared to move forward with\nblocking private listings\nfrom its websites.\nIn an email to subscribers on Saturday, the Chicago area\u2019s MLS operator Midwest Real Estate Data (MRED) said that Zillow has been contacting brokerages asking for direct listing feeds and warning that Zillow\u2019s access to local listings could be disrupted in early January. Zillow is also \u201callegedly threatening to contact sellers\u201d about the potential disruption, the email said.\nZillow is asking brokerages to sign multi-year agreements for direct listing feeds, MRED claimed, which would eliminate the need for Zillow to receive listing data in the region from the MLS.\nTension is rising in the monthslong stalemate between MRED and the national home search giant over MRED\u2019s\nPrivate Listing Network\n, which allows sellers to show listings to agents in MRED\u2019s market and their clients but not the broader public. Under Zillow\u2019s\nlisting access standards\n, rolled out earlier this year, listings that appear first on the private network and then move to public channels would be blocked from appearing on Zillow.\nMRED has previously stated Zillow blocking certain listings would be a violation of its licensing agreement with the MLS, suggesting Zillow could lose access to MLS data if it enforces its standards. MRED did not respond to a request for comment.\nWhile Zillow hasn\u2019t started enforcing its listing rules in Chicago, its direct appeal to brokerages shows it\u2019s preparing for the possibility of losing access to MRED\u2019s listings. The frequently asked questions section of Zillow\u2019s listing access standards states it will accept a direct broker feed of listings \u201cin the event the MLS doesn\u2019t send an IDX or VOW feed with all coming soon/delayed marketing or active listings.\u201d\nIn its email to subscribers, MRED said it had not given Zillow any notices of policy violations that would merit losing access to MLS listing data.\n\u201cUnless Zillow anticipates violating MRED policy, we do not understand why they claim service will be interrupted in January,\u201d MRED\u2019s email said. \u201cMRED has asked Zillow for an explanation and has yet to receive an answer.\u201d\nIn the email, MRED directed brokers to ask Zillow why the company expects its access to listings to be interrupted, and asked brokers to share those conversations with MRED. The MLS also directed subscribers to contact Illinois regulators and local real estate associations if they feel that Zillow\u2019s requests violate state law or Realtor ethics.\nZillow declined to comment. The company hasn\u2019t said when it will begin enforcing its listing standards in the Chicago market.\nZillow, which has been sued by Compass over the same listing standards at issue in Chicago, has criticized the Private Listing Network for distorting the market and putting consumers at a disadvantage.\nZillow also argued Chicago\u2019s Private Listing Network\ndeepens segregation in Chicago\n. The company released an analysis in November that showed private listings were twice as common in white neighborhoods as they are in non-white neighborhoods, but MRED pushed back against the methodology and narrative.\n",

        "content": "Virgin Hotels is asking a Dallas court to publicly name three women who claim they were sexually assaulted by disgraced\ndeveloper Bill Hutchinson\n.\nHutchinson, the reality television star known for developing the Virgin Hotel Dallas, was accused by three women of sexual assault and battery in a 2021 lawsuit \u2014 the same year he was twice arrested in connection with sexual assault claims by a minor.\nThe suit also accuses Hutchinson\u2019s firm, Dunhill Partners, and Virgin Hotels of negligence, claiming both companies were aware that Hutchinson would use the hotel and nearby Dunhill-owned apartments to meet and prey upon young women.\nHutchinson has denied the allegations, calling the matter \u201ca frivolous \u2018shakedown\u2019 lawsuit filed by two former girlfriends and another woman who seek to turn consensual relationships and actions into payday\u201d in a 2024 filing.\nVirgin Hotels in a 2025 filing denied having a duty to the accusers and said the company had knowledge of the risk posed by Hutchinson.\nIn a filing last week,\nVirgin Hotels\nasked the court to change the protective order in place, claiming the accusers\u2019 use of pseudonyms allows them to \u201canonymously prosecute salacious claims.\u201d It also asserts that the use of numbered pseudonyms (Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4) implies that additional accusers exist in the case.\nThere are no additional accusers in the case, but Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 are three of the at least five women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, according to a source familiar with the matter.\nMichelle Simpson Tuegel, the attorney for the accusers, called the filing \u201ca desperate late-stage tactic from a powerful corporation to scare and further traumatize our clients.\u201d\n\u201cDefendants have known these plaintiffs\u2019 names for years and have been provided with their extensive personal records,\u201d she said in a statement\nJane Doe 1 is described in the suit as a college student when she said Hutchinson sexually assaulted her by getting her intoxicated at Virgin Hotel Dallas, taking her across the street to the apartment complex he owned and forcibly touching her. She reached out to him for career advice, the lawsuit claims.\nJane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 were in their late 20s when they became connected with Hutchinson, who they both claim raped them multiple times, according to the complaint.\n\u201cVirgin Hotels\u2019 leadership knew that Hutchinson was a problem, having received direct reports from Virgin Hotels Dallas\u2019 employees and others about Hutchinson\u2019s behavior with women,\u201d the initial lawsuit claimed.\nIt said Virgin Hotels\u2019 CEO was aware of the reports before Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 met Hutchinson, but \u201cVirgin Hotels Dallas, VirginServices, Virgin North America, and Virgin Hotels did nothing.\u201d\nHutchinson, who founded Dunhill Partners in 1984, starred on the TLC reality show \u201cMarrying Millions.\u201d The show featured him and his 23-year-old girlfriend, a woman he met when she was 18 and working at a restaurant.\nHutchinson was arrested in 2021 in Dallas and Orange County and charged with one felony count of rape of an unconscious person and five misdemeanor counts of sexual battery. A 17-year-old girl claimed he assaulted her at his Highland Park home. The same girl and a second teenager also accused him of assaulting them at his Laguna Beach home, also in 2021.\nA Dallas grand jury\ndeclined to indict him\non charges related to the Dallas claims. He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor sexual battery in the California case, which required him to register as a sex offender. Three of his accusers filed a civil suit in Dallas \u2014 that\u2019s the ongoing suit in which Virgin Hotels is looking to identify them.\nHutchinson stepped down from his role as CEO of Dunhill Partners after his arrest, but he has resumed the role. The firm has also been\noffloading apartment complexes\nin the wake of the allegations. His reputation has suffered from the allegations, but not to the extent that he\u2019s shunned by the real estate community. As recently as November, he delivered an address to the Cornell Real Estate Council in Dallas.\nThe next hearing in the case \u2014 to hear Virgin Hotels\u2019 request to change the protective order \u2014 is scheduled for Feb. 2. The case is set to go to trial on June 8.\n",

        "content": "South Florida\u2019s most expensive residential sales this year show a bifurcated market: one for the billionaires, and one for the rest.\nIt\u2019s a sign of how the wealth migration that began in the pandemic is shaping the region. For the first time in recent years, though, Florida\u2019s most expensive home sale of the year closed on the west coast, not the east.\nIn April, the billionaire DeGroote family sold their waterfront Naples estate for\n$225 million\n, making it the second-most expensive ever home sale in the U.S. It is also a price record for the state of Florida, topping Larry Ellison\u2019s $173 million purchase of a Manalapan estate in 2022.\nThe deal that took the top spot within the tri-county region is indicative of the deep investment by the nation\u2019s wealthiest individuals. Billionaire cosmetics mogul William Lauder sold an oceanfront lot in Palm Beach to a buyer sources say is billionaire Microsoft Excel creator Charles Simonyi, as part of a $350 million assemblage on the island.\nWhile South Florida\u2019s\nnon-luxury housing market stumbled this year\n, the market for homes over $10 million flourished. Economic uncertainty in the spring, mainly credited to tariff concerns, delayed but did not prevent pricey sales.\nHere are the most expensive sales in South Florida in 2025, based on\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nresearch.\n\u2265$160M | 1063 and 1071 North Ocean Boulevard, Palm Beach\nThe single most expensive sale in South Florida this year closed off-market and did not record publicly. Sources say the final sale price for the 2.3 oceanfront acres was more than $160 million. Lauder bought the land for $66.3 million in 2019 and 2020, and listed them for $177.8 million. They have 360 feet of beachfront.\nChristian Angle with Christian Angle Real Estate had the listing, and Ryan Serhant with Serhant brought the buyer.\nOther deals tied to the assemblage are the\n$18 million\nsale of 1066 North Ocean Boulevard and $30 million deal for 1072 North Ocean Boulevard.\n$120M | 26 Star Island Drive, Miami Beach\nBillionaire developer Vlad Doronin sold his 2.5-acre Star Island estate in Miami Beach for a record $120 million to Merrick Ventures\u2019 Michael Ferro in March. Doronin bought the 22,000-square-foot estate from Shaquille O\u2019Neal for $16 million in 2009. The six-bedroom, seven-bathroom home has a tennis court, a pool and a dock.\nTIE | $105M |\n9 West Indian Creek Island Road, Indian Creek Village\n&amp;\n5940 North Bay Road, Miami Beach\nTwo residential properties sold for $105 million in Miami-Dade County this year, tying for third-most expensive home sale in the tri-county region.\nIn June, an entity managed by Mikhail and Mariana Peleg sold the 1.8-acre waterfront lot at 9 Indian Creek Island Road for $105 million. It last sold for\n$27.5 million\nin 2018, records show. The estate is adjacent to two of the lots Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos bought last year.\nIn July, spec developer Todd Glaser and the Posner Group paid $105 million for the 2.3-acre waterfront estate at 5940 North Bay Road. The sellers were developer Sonny Kahn and his wife Suzanne Kohn. They bought the home for $2.4 million in 1991. It was built in 1936 and includes a 19,000-square-foot mansion with eight bedrooms, 13 bathrooms and three half-bathrooms. It has 290 feet of waterfront. Glaser and his partner will either\nflip the compound for $169 million\nor redevelop the estate and list it for $300 million.\nNelson Gonzalez with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty and Zachary Vichinsky and Brett Harris from Bespoke Real Estate have the listing.\n\u2265$100M | 4055 Southwest 37th Avenue, Coral Gables\nBillionaire Jorge Mas sold the 7.3-acre compound at 4055 Southwest 37th Avenue in Coral Gables in an off-market deal this year. Adjacent to the Kampong Botanical Garden, the land last sold for $9 million in 2000, according to property records, but sources told\u00a0 TRD that Mas bought the estate this year and is flipping it. The deal has yet to appear in city records.\nDeveloper Alex Pirez of Mocca Realty represented the seller, and Bespoke Real Estate\u2019s Brett Harris represented the buyer.\n$97.5M | 11465 and 11472 Old Harbour Road, North Palm Beach\nWilliam Wrigley Jr., an heir to the Wrigley chewing gum fortune, sold the waterfront compound at 11465 and 11472 Old Harbour Road in North Palm Beach for $97.5 million. Wrigley sold the 2.5-acre assemblage to an undisclosed buyer. The off-market deal was the most-expensive ever recorded in Lost Tree Village, a private golf community, and may be the priciest in North Palm Beach.\nSerhant\u2019s Gary Pohrer represented Wrigley, while Douglas Elliman\u2019s Donna Hutchins represented the buyer.\n$86.5M | 203 South Lake Trail, Palm Beach\nHellman Jordan founder Jerry Jordan and his wife, Darlene Jordan, sold their lakefront estate at 20203 South Lake Trail in Palm Beach for $86.5 million. It was the most expensive single-family home sale on the island this year, topped only by Lauder\u2019s land sale. Records show the couple paid $14 million for the 1.7-acre estate in 2000. Built in 1938, it includes a 13,400-square-foot main house with five bedrooms, eight bathrooms and one half-bathroom, a pool and a dock.\nIn 2024, the Jordans hired\nRobert A.M. Stern Architects\nto design a new mansion on the property with a pool house and padel court.\n$86M | 9149 Collins Avenue, PH-11, Surfside\nFort Partners, led by Nadim Ashi, sold a penthouse at its Seaway at the Surf Club for $86 million to a hidden buyer. It is the most expensive condo ever sold in Miami-Dade County. It spans 16,000 square feet, with the sale equating to $5,358 per square foot. Ashi completed the two-building, 34-unit, 11-story Seaway last year. Designed by Joseph Dirand and landscape designer Peter Wirtz, it is part of the Four Seasons Residences at the Surf Club complex. Seaway residents have access to the Surf Club amenities, which includes four pools, a private club and Thomas Keller restaurant.\n$74.3M | 88 La Gorce Circle, Miami Beach\nHedge fund manager Nick Maounis, head of Veriton Fund Management, bought the 1-acre waterfront estate at 88 La Gorce Circle for $74.3 million in March. Maounis previously founded Amaranth Advisors, which collapsed in 2006 after losing more than $6 billion on natural gas futures in one of the biggest hedge fund collapses in history.\nThe sellers were the Kollmans, a wealthy German family, who bought it for $15.7 million in 2010, records show. The 21,700-square-foot, nine-bedroom mansion was built in 2008 by Todd Michael Glaser, and includes a pool and 260 feet of waterfront.\nNelson Gonzalez with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty had the listing, and Ryan Mendell of Maxwelle Real Estate Group brought the buyer.\n$73M | 530 South Ocean Boulevard, Palm Beach\nBillionaire Red Ventures co-founder and CEO Ric Elias sold the oceanfront mansion at 530 South Ocean Boulevard in Palm Beach in an off-market deal. Elias and his wife Brenda Elias bought the 0.7-acre property for $37.5 million in 2020. Built in 2018, the\u00a0 12,900-square-foot mansion has eight bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, four half-bathrooms and a pool. It sold fully furnished, including art.\nJack Rooney with Douglas Elliman represented the buyer and the seller.\n$69.5M | 276 Bal Bay Drive, Bal Harbour\nBillionaire Patrick Dovigi, a former hockey player and founder of Canadian waste management company Green For Life Environmental, sold a waterfront house in Bal Harbour for $69.5 million in March. He bought the 1-acre estate at 276 Bal Bay Drive in 2022 from billionaire Shari Arison, whose family owns Carnival Cruise Lines, for\n$41.5 million\n.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Dina Goldentayer brokered the deal.\n",

        "content": "Kering\nmade good\non its goal to sell a massive stake in the Fifth Avenue property it bought roughly two years ago.\nPrivate equity firm Ardian bought a 60 percent stake in 715-717 Fifth Avenue from Gucci\u2019s parent company, the two firms\nannounced\non Tuesday morning. The deal values the 115,000-square-foot property at $900 million and will see Kering score $690 million in proceeds.\nKering is hanging on to a 40 percent stake in the Plaza District property, which it bought early last year from Jeff Sutton and SL Green\nfor $963 million\n. The acquisition was part of a strategy to buy prime assets in strong markets across the globe.\nIt was also part of a trend of retailers acquiring their own spaces in Manhattan rather than leasing them. Around the time of the Kering deal, Prada paid $835 million for 724 and 720 Fifth Avenue, which was also sold by Wharton Properties boss Sutton.\nIn recent months, however, Kering has been looking to offload properties to improve its balance sheet. By the end of last year, Kering\u2019s debt soared to approximately $12 billion, leading it to start cutting costs and sell stakes in real estate across the globe.\nEarlier this year, Ardian and Kering entered into a similar joint venture centered on a three-property portfolio in Paris. Kering has also been exploring disposition options in Milan\u2019s Via Montenapoleone and in Tokyo. The mission is to raise at least 2 billion Euros through real estate transactions over a two-year period.\nNotably, France-based Ardian never made a real estate investment in the United States prior to this deal.\n\u201cWe are truly committed to acquiring and managing ultra prime assets in the most sought-after locations,\u201d Ardian executive Omar Fjer said in a statement.\nElsewhere in the Plaza District, Louis Vuitton\nfiled an application\nwith the Department of City Planning for a 25-story building at 1 East 57th Street, which would span 148,000 square feet alongside Fifth Avenue.\n",

        "content": "The head of next year\u2019s FIFA World Cup host committee just dropped $20.7 million on an Upper West Side penthouse.\nAlex Lasry, the son of former Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry, shelled out roughly $2,500 per square foot for an apartment at\n535 West End Avenue\n, according to public records.\nThe 8,400-square-foot condo was sold by a trust tied to Tamar Wolchok and Simona Ganz, the daughters of the late Slim-Fast mogul S. Daniel Abraham. Abraham died earlier this year at the\nage of 100\n.\nIt\u2019s unclear when Wolchok and Ganz purchased the property, as the only other deed recorded in city rolls shows an LLC by the same name as the trust, 4M Holdings, transferring ownership to the entity in 2023. The trust appears to have listed the home in 2011 with an asking price of $37.5 million, according to StreetEasy.\nThe six-bedroom, six-bathroom penthouse hit the market in January asking $26 million, though it later endured a series of price cuts. Its last asking price was just under $19 million, suggesting the condo may have sold in a bidding war.\nThe apartment also features a staff room, private elevator landing and rooftop terrace with an outdoor kitchen and fireplace. Amenities in the building, developed by Gary Barnett\u2019s Extell Development and completed in 2010, include a pool, gym and parking garage.\nCorcoran\u2019s Steven Cohen, who represented the seller, declined to comment on the deal.\nEarlier this year, developer Leon Melohn sold his full-floor condo at the building for\n$15.9 million\n, roughly six years after he and his wife purchased it for $15.7 million.\nLasry was tapped to serve as the CEO of the FIFA 2026 World Cup Host Committee for New York and New Jersey in February. The tournament is scheduled to begin in the area on June 13, 2026, and continue until July 19.\nLasry was previously the deputy assistant secretary for travel and tourism at the U.S. Department of Commerce. He also campaigned for a Wisconsin Senate seat as a Democrat in 2022, though he later dropped out of the race.\nLasry\u2019s father, also a co-founder of the hedge fund Avenue Capital Group, in October listed his duplex co-op on West 66th Street for $42 million. The move came more than a decade after he and his wife Cathy, an interior designer, purchased it for $33 million.",

The primary suite spans the entire second floor with a private terrace, dressing room and an ensuite bath with a freestanding soaking tub and double rain shower.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Nadia Bartolucci and Alex Tsao had the listing.\nLast week\u2019s other top contract went to a unit at a boutique new development in Cobble Hill at 323 Clinton Street, also asking nearly $7 million. Unit 1 is a triplex in the four-unit building developed by Eckstrom NYC, referred to as the \u201ctownhouse unit,\u201d according to StreetEasy.\nSpanning over 4,200 square feet, the home features four bedrooms, four bathrooms, a private garden, a terrace and a dedicated street entrance. The finished cellar level includes a 25-foot-wide media room with a working fireplace, a fitness area and a dry sauna.\nBuilt in 1910, Eckstrom converted the former rental building while preserving the brownstone facade and maintaining original details like a stained-glass transom and pier mirror.\nEckstrom co-founder Carlos Saavedra said the townhouse-style condo units appeal to buyers who want a townhouse but can\u2019t afford an entire renovated building.\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough for buyers of townhouses to find us as they typically are not searching for condos,\u201d he said.\nSaavedra had the listing through his brokerage, Park Property Advisors, along with Jorge Murillo.\nThere were 18 contracts signed last week \u2014 seven condos, one co-op and 10 townhouses \u2014 for almost $66 million. That follows\n23 contracts signed for $73 million\nin the previous period.\nHomes put into contract last week had a median asking price of almost $3 million, an average discount of 3 percent and spent an average of 104 days on the market.\n",

        "content": "Blue Star Properties is buying out its own lender on a West Loop building at a steep discount. It\u2019s resetting the clock on a long-term bet many landlords have abandoned in Chicago\u2019s battered office market.\nThe Chicago-based firm purchased a $38.9 million mortgage backed by the 10-story office building it owns at 328 South Jefferson Street, according to Blue Star principal\nCraig Golden\n. The move recapitalized the 293,037-square-foot property about five months after Blue Star and Wells Fargo quietly put it up for sale in an effort to resolve the overdue debt, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nGolden declined to disclose the price paid for the loan, but a source familiar with the deal said\nBlue Star\nshelled out roughly $50 per square foot, or just over $14 million, according to the publication. That kind of haircut has become common, as downtown office values crater under the weight of remote work and higher interest rates. What\u2019s less common is an owner stepping in to buy the paper rather than handing over the keys.\nThe transaction marks an escape from a long stalemate for Blue Star. With the loan past maturity, the firm had been effectively sidelined from pursuing new leases for nearly two years, Golden told the outlet.\nWells Fargo, which inherited the loan through its 2008 acquisition of Wachovia, increased the debt multiple times as Blue Star leased up the building, according to Cook County records. The buyout locked in a loss for the bank, but cleared the way for Blue Star to move forward.\nThe firm financed the debt purchase with a new loan from Aurora-based Old Second National Bank. Golden said Blue Star plans to refresh the lobby and common areas as it ramps up leasing efforts.\nThe building was 61 percent leased when it hit the market over the summer, according to a Cushman &amp; Wakefield marketing flyer. It has 27 tenants, a weighted average lease term of 3.1 years and space to accommodate a tenant of up to about 30,000 square feet following the departure of third-party logistics firm Total Quality Logistics.\nBlue Star\nalso recently bought 2 North Riverside Plaza for a fraction of its pre-pandemic value. It\u2019s betting on nearby momentum, including The Chicago School\u2019s medical campus at\n400 South Jefferson\nand a planned 198-unit apartment project Blue Star is developing across the street.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "An office tower in Dallas\u2019 Arts District has a new, local owner.\nAn affiliate of TRT Holdings purchased St. Paul Place, a 22-story office building at\n750 North Saint Paul Street\n, from Pacific Elm Properties, according to Dallas County deed records. The deal closed Dec. 2. Pricing was not disclosed, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nTRT Holdings is a Dallas-based investment firm founded by billionaire Robert Rowling and his father, Reese Rowling. The company is best known as the owner of Omni Hotels &amp; Resorts, but it also has a long history of investing in office, residential and mixed-use properties in Texas and beyond.\nBuilt in 1983, the green-glass tower spans nearly 275,000 square feet and sits in the heart of the Arts District, a pocket of downtown that has generally fared better than older office submarkets. The Dallas Central Appraisal District valued the property at just over $47 million for tax purposes this year.\nTenants at St. Paul Place include real estate information giant Costar Group, law firm Mayer and a mix of professional service businesses. More than 23,500 square feet are being marketed for sublease, according to a current listing, reflecting the ongoing reshuffling of space needs across downtown.\nThe property also comes with some recent baggage. St. Paul Place underwent months of renovation following a flood in April, according to the publication, work that likely factored into both the timing and underwriting of the sale.\nPacific Elm\nbought the building in 2023 from Dallas-based Quadrant Investment Properties, financing the acquisition with a $66.7 million loan from MetLife Commercial Mortgage. Pacific Elm has been an active downtown investor, with stakes in properties such as 2100 Ross, Bryan Tower and\nSantander Tower\n. How the St. Paul Place exit pencils out for the firm remains unclear without a disclosed sales price.\nQuadrant acquired the tower in 2016 and poured millions into a major overhaul, including a redesigned ground-floor lobby and new outdoor patio spaces aimed at making the building more competitive.\nThe latest deal lands amid a modest but notable run of office trades in Dallas\u2019 urban core this year. While volumes remain well below pre-pandemic norms, buyers are stepping in. The largest office sale of 2025 so far was Crescent Real Estate\u2019s acquisition of the Texas Capital Center at\n2000 McKinney Avenue\n, a deal backed by Fort Worth billionaire John Goff. Like St. Paul Place, that sale came without a disclosed price.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The revelation came in a recent investor presentation, where Chief Financial Officer Matthew DiLiberto said the company was \u201cselling assets [and] losing [income] to fight against interest rates that are too high.\u201d\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean SL Green is done buying. Though it is seeking to unload roughly $2.5 billion of property, the company also plans to make $1 billion worth of acquisitions, according to executives.\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready to deploy our $1.3 billion debt fund, have a goal of more than $1 billion in acquisitions and are even considering share buybacks,\u201d the company said in a statement.\nAmong the properties SL Green is putting up for sale:\n1350 Sixth Avenue, a 600,000-square-foot office building in the Plaza District.\n245 Park Avenue\n, a 1.7-million-square-foot property within a famed corridor. SL Green acquired the property out of bankruptcy in 2022 and sold 50 percent of the equity in 2023 to Japanese developer Mori Trust in a deal that valued the tower at $2 billion. This time, SL Green is eyeing a 25 percent stake sale.\n750 Third Avenue, which is in the process of being converted into 680 apartments. SL Green would look to hand off a 65 percent stake in the redevelopment.\nThe timing for SL Green could prove bountiful as Manhattan\u2019s office market stands above the rest of the country. The office vacancy rate in Manhattan is 13.1 percent, according to Moody\u2019s, compared to 19.3 percent across the nation.\nBut SL Green, which reportedly carries $7 billion in liabilities, has seen its stock price dip by a third this year. There are concerns the real estate investment trust could\ncut its dividend\nnext year as cash flow diminishes for the landlord.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

That edges past Surfside\u2019s previous record set with the 2023 sale of 99A Surfside Avenue, which traded for an even $6.4 million, or $1,829 per square foot.\nIt also makes for the third Surfside deal in the first two weeks of the month, with the other two trades also located in the A row.\nColdwell Banker Realty\n\u2019s Kimia Vakili represented the seller. The brokerage\u2019s Ash Rizk brought the buyer, a Los Angeles County family that was looking for a coastal property, according to a Coldwell Banker spokesperson.\nThe\nOrange County\nproperty last traded about a year ago for $4.5 million, or $1,140 per square foot, to a\nCorona del Mar\nlimited liability company called Pelican Real Estate Group, property and state records indicate.\nThe four-bedroom, six-bathroom home was rebuilt in 2000 and saw a full renovation completed earlier this year. The 3,948-square-foot property has two primary suites, an office, European oakwood flooring and chef\u2019s kitchen with custom cabinetry.\nSometimes referred to by agents as Malibu South, Surfside is spread across less than 1 acre of land and is governed by a five-member board of directors. The nonprofit corporation was created in 1930 with a community designed in three rows, labeled A, B and C. Row A consists of oceanfront properties, while C homes most commonly do not have ocean views. B offers a mix.\nColdwell Banker\u2019s been on a tear in Seal Beach this year, which is seeing home prices across the city rise. The median home price in October was $488,500, which was up 18.4 percent year-over-year, according to Redfin data.\nColdwell Banker\u2019s Garrett Weston held the listing on 308 Ocean Avenue, which sold for $12.5 million, or $1,446 per square foot, in July to mark the city\u2019s highest-priced deal this year.\nPut into a broader context, the latest Surfside deal is Seal Beach\u2019s third-priciest residential closing in 2025.\n",

        "content": "The Chicago Housing Authority is under the microscope, as federal watchdogs dig into how the agency vets tenants for immigration status and criminal backgrounds, adding another layer of scrutiny to one of the city\u2019s most powerful real estate institutions.\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Office of Inspector General has launched an audit of the\nCHA\nto examine whether it is properly verifying who qualifies for federally assisted housing, according to documents obtained and first\nreported\nby the Chicago Sun-Times. The review also aims to assess how the authority prevents and addresses criminal activity in its properties.\nThe audit notice states that its objective is to determine whether CHA complied with HUD\u2019s requirements for verifying eligibility for assisted housing, based on disqualifying factors such as criminal activity, citizenship and immigration status, as well as to assess the agency\u2019s practices in regards to addressing and preventing criminal activity.\nThe letter, dated Sept. 15, was sent to CHA Interim Operating Chairman\nMatthew Brewer\nby Kilah White, HUD\u2019s assistant inspector general for audit. HUD said the work would begin immediately and will cover the period from Sept. 1, 2022 through Aug. 31, 2025.\nHUD spokesperson Matthew Maley said the audit is part of a broader national push ordered by HUD Secretary Scott Turner. Earlier this\nyear\n, Turner told public housing authorities the agency intended to \u201cfully carry out the law\u201d and ensure that no \u201cillegals or ineligibles\u201d are receiving HUD assistance. HUD is auditing housing authorities across the country, Maley said, including through on the ground investigations like the one in Chicago.\nThe CHA did not respond to requests for comment from the publication.\nChicago is not alone. A HUD official familiar with the process said the CHA is one of a handful of housing authorities currently being audited, alongside the District of Columbia Housing Authority. In August, Turner publicly said HUD had given the D.C. agency 30 days to turn over information about residents\u2019 citizenship status, adding that similar demands were being made of more than 3,000 public housing authorities nationwide.\nThe CHA audit lands against a charged political backdrop. The Trump administration has intensified its focus on immigration enforcement and crime in Democratic-led cities, and HUD has increasingly framed housing oversight around \u201claw and order.\u201d The agency last week notified Boston Mayor Michelle Wu that it was opening an investigation into the city\u2019s\nhousing policies\n, accusing her administration of violating the Fair Housing Act through its equity initiatives.\nCloser to home, the CHA has already been navigating federal pressure tied to Trump-era executive orders, including bans on diversity, equity and inclusion programs. The authority sued HUD over those requirements in October, before dropping the case after receiving a filing extension.\nThe CHA is the third-largest housing authority in the country, with a budget exceeding $1 billion. It serves more than 65,000 households and is the city\u2019s largest single landlord. Any findings from the audit could ripple through how public housing is managed, funded and policed in Chicago\u2019s neighborhoods.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Two long-struggling office towers in\nArlington\nare inching closer to the sale block, offering an example of older suburban office buildings experiencing distress across North Texas.\nCopeland Tower and Stadium Place, adjacent properties at 1250 and 1200 East Copeland Road totaling just over 210,000 square feet, are now expected to be marketed for sale in early 2026, according to a Nov. 15 notice tied to their commercial mortgage-backed securities loan. The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat the update comes as the buildings\u2019 appraised value keeps sinking and leasing momentum remains elusive.\nThe 12-story Copeland Tower at 1250 East Copeland Road spans 126,628 square feet, while the neighboring five-story Stadium Place at 1200 East Copeland totals 84,653 square feet. Built in 1987 and renovated in 2017, the towers sit just over a mile from Arlington\u2019s\nEntertainment District\nand are familiar fixtures to drivers along\nI-30\n.\nIn 2022, a commercial mortgage-backed securities trust arranged by\nSwiss bank UBS\ntook title to both buildings from Houston-based Aqua Investment Group following a foreclosure auction. Since then, the trust has focused on stabilizing the properties through leasing and renewals, while weighing longer-term options.\nEarlier notices indicated plans to market the buildings this year. The latest filing pushes that timeline out, stating the \u201cnote holder anticipates marketing the collateral for sale\u201d in the first quarter of 2026. Chris Hamilton was recently appointed as substitute trustee to oversee the properties on behalf of the loan servicer.\nLeasing conditions have done little to bolster the outlook. According to recent CMBS investor reports, Copeland Tower\u2019s occupancy has been stuck at 40 percent since the start of the year. Stadium Place slipped to 68 percent occupied, down from 77 percent in February.\nMajor tenants include the Texas Department of Family &amp; Protective Services and Meyer Distributing. Northstar Energy Services\u2019 roughly 10,900-square-foot lease expired in November. The state agency\u2019s 46,239-square-foot lease at Stadium Place runs through 2027.\nValuations tell a harsher story. The combined appraised value of the towers fell to $9.4 million as of Sept. 24, down roughly 67 percent from a $29 million valuation in 2018. The properties are saddled with at least $18.6 million in outstanding mortgage debt, according to servicer reports.\nThe decline marks a sharp reversal from pre-pandemic highs. After years of stagnant leasing, occupancy climbed to about 92 percent in 2018 and 2019 following a push by Bradford Commercial. That progress unraveled during the pandemic, as tenants downsized and ownership sought repeated loan relief. Several large leases rolled in 2023 and 2024, including health care firm Multiplan\u2019s 59,153 square feet.\nThe Arlington-Mansfield Class B office market totals about 3.8 million square feet, according to JLL, and has logged negative absorption this year with vacancy hovering above 13 percent.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A landlord battered by the pandemic-era collapse in tourism is scrambling to hang on to a boutique Nolita hotel as a long-running foreclosure inches forward.\nVeracity Equities, the lower Manhattan-focused firm run by Edmond Li, is facing a $35.3 million judgment tied to a defaulted mortgage at the Nolitan, a 55-key hotel at 153 Elizabeth Street. The nine-story building on the corner of Kenmare Street had been slated to go up for auction this week, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nInstead, the auction has been pushed \u2014 again. Li and lender Silverpeak Real Estate Finance agreed Monday to delay the sale until Feb. 4, a move that appears aimed at buying the borrower more time to secure a refinancing and pay off the debt.\nThe delay marks the third time the court postponed an auction of the property, underscoring how messy and drawn-out pandemic-era hotel workouts can be.\nLi bought the Elizabeth Street site in 2006 for $5.4 million and redeveloped it into the Nolitan, which opened in 2011. Today, rooms start at around $300 a night. The property is also home to the Japanese-Italian restaurant Kimika on the ground floor.\nSilverpeak, a Midtown-based lender, issued a $24 million loan on the property in 2016 that was later securitized and sold to investors. After Covid shutdowns destroyed hotel revenue, Li stopped making payments in 2021, prompting the lender to launch foreclosure proceedings later that year, according to court records.\nLi has argued that the lender and a court-appointed receiver undercut his efforts to stabilize the asset, including blocking plans for a rooftop bar that could have generated roughly $68,000 a month in rent and preventing repairs to address water leaks.\nManhattan Supreme Court Justice Francis Kahn ultimately sided with Silverpeak, ruling that Li remains liable for roughly $35 million, including principal, interest and fees.\nIf the foreclosure goes through, it would be the latest blow to Veracity\u2019s downtown portfolio.\nThe firm is also facing foreclosure on a $32 million loan tied to three nearby rental buildings at 137 Thompson Street and 26 and 29 Prince Street. Last year, Li sold a mixed-use walkup at 146 Mulberry Street for $12.7 million, below the $13.3 million he paid in 2015.\nSilverpeak\u2019s attorney declined to comment. Li and his counsel did not return calls.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The loan will help support the multifamily development, expected to wrap in the fall of 2027.\nAffinius Capital provided the loan for the 21-story, 276-unit project at the corner of Douglass and Bond streets. The development is expected to include 20,000 square feet of retail space on the ground floor.\nUnits in the building will range from studio to three-bedroom layouts.

Several months ago, it teamed up with 3650 Capital to\nprovide $156 million\nin debt to Prime Holdings Group, which refinanced a trio of self-storage properties in the outer boroughs.\nMidwood\u2019s portfolio spans more than 100 properties nationwide. Among its prominent New York developments are the Candela Tower in Manhattan, 800 Union Street in Brooklyn and The Williams, also in Brooklyn.\nDevelopers began flocking to Gowanus several years ago when the neighborhood was rezoned in 2021, a move expected to add more than 8,000 apartments to the area over the span of a decade.\nIn a statement, Usdan referred to Gowanus as \u201cone of Brooklyn\u2019s most dynamic and rapidly evolving neighborhoods.\u201d\nLast month, David Tabak\nacquired\na development site at 563 Sackett Street in Gowanus for $58.5 million.

The parcel is owned by Del Mar Property, an entity managed by local developer Gerard Ngo.\nWhen complete, Prospect Villa will deliver 75 one-, two-, three- and four-bedroom apartments atop roughly 6,350 square feet of ground-floor retail, \u201caddressing the housing needs of Rosemead\u201d while \u201ctransforming [the] underutilized site into a vibrant community hub,\u201d Wong said. The location is currently a vacant lot.\nThe financing arrives amid an uncertain capital markets environment as higher interest rates and elevated construction costs present obstacles to development. At the same time, developers and institutional investors have been\nturning their attention outside Los Angeles\ncity limits to communities like Rosemead to avoid hurdles like\nMeasure ULA\n. \u201cSecuring construction financing in today\u2019s capital markets requires a compelling sponsor and a project that truly fits the local demographic,\u201d Wong said.\nSite owner Ngo is no stranger to Rosemead, and this stretch of Garvey Avenue in particular. In 2023, Ngo, acting through his Green Park Property firm,\nfiled plans to build\n93 apartments with 5,400 square feet ground-floor retail and restaurants at 7849-7857 Garvey Avenue and 7900-7916 Virginia Street. The project would replace a row of small commercial buildings at Garvey and Del Mar avenues and boast one, two- and three-bedroom units.\nThe average rent in the San Gabriel Valley is $2,039 a month, well below the overall L.A. County average of $2,336, according to a third-quarter market report from Lee &amp; Associates cited by CO. Compared to a year ago, there are also more apartment buildings on the market as owners face strict rent control laws, rising cost of ownership and higher utility costs and insurance premiums.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Adi Chugh\u2019s Tyko Capital delivered.\nExtell Development landed $1.13 billion in construction financing for its 74-story project in Midtown Manhattan, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The deal, done without brokers, represents the largest construction financing package in New York City this year.\nThe financing closed on Monday. Tyko declined to comment to the Observer, while Extell did not return a request for comment.\nExtell in July filed a rezoning application with the Department of City Planning for the site, doubling the number of stories Barnett had in mind when the firm initially filed plans last fall.\nThe rezoning application described a 765,000-square-foot project that would stand 1,162 feet tall and include 154 residential units. The residential space would span 476,000 square feet, while 233,000 square feet of commercial space would be split between office and retail, mostly the former.\nBarnett offered to improve the Fifth Avenue/59th Street N/R/W subway station in exchange for 130,000 square feet of space. Extell also wants to transfer 135,000 square feet of development rights from the Metropolitan Club at 790 Fifth Avenue.\nWithout the rezoning, Extell was last considering a plan for an even taller, 84-story property, though it would have less residential and office space. That project would span 600,000 square feet with 158 residential units, which could be adjusted in either direction depending on unit size.\nThe estimated completion date would be in 2031.\nExtell bought the property between East 60th and East 61st streets last October for\nnearly $160 million\nfrom Williams Equities. The 24-story building was last renovated in 2005 and charged office rents between $54 and $66 per square foot, according to CoStar estimates.\nIn the spring, luxury fashion brand Chanel was reported to be\nin discussions\nto purchase the retail space at the development, potentially paying in the mid-$400 millions for the 65,000 square feet.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The developers of Miami Beach\u2019s Goodtime Hotel are in for a not-so-good time over a payment guarantee tied to an allegedly defaulted $149.3 million mortgage.\nEric Birnbaum and Michael Fascitelli allege CIM Group is seeking to illegally collect at least $10 million via the payment guarantee, even if they turn over the 266-key hotel at\n601 Washington Avenue\nvia a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. That\u2019s according to a counterclaim filed in New York Supreme Court this week against an affiliate of the Sacramento-based lender.\nIn July, the CIM affiliate sued Birnbaum and Fascitelli, who lead New York-based Imperial Companies, for allegedly breaching the payment guarantee by failing to make the $10 million payment and giving up the property, which is part of Marriott\u2019s Tribute Portfolio division.\nThe CIM affiliate alleges the Imperial Companies affiliate that owns Goodtime Hotel failed to repay roughly $149.3 million when the loan matured last year.\nAttorneys for Birnbaum, Fascitelli and CIM declined comment.\nGoodtime Hotel\nopened in 2021 with a lot of fanfare. At the time, Birnbaum and Fascitelli touted\u00a0 celebrity Pharrell Williams, hospitality mogul David Grutman and designer Ken Fulk as partners in the project. They developed the hotel with a\n$45 million\nconstruction loan after acquiring the property for\n$36 million\nin 2015.\nA lawyer\u2019s costly mistake\nAccording to court filings, Goodtime Hotel\u2019s owners signed the payment guarantee agreement in 2021, when they obtained a\n$164 million\nfinancing from CIM that was subsequently reduced to $152 million. Birnbaum and Fascitelli allege the agreement was supposed to state that they would pay for three months of carrying costs in the event the lender foreclosed on the property or the hotel owners relinquished the property in a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.\nBut their lawyer, Gary Axelrod with Chicago-based law firm Lathan &amp; Watkins, allegedly missed an error in the agreement that did not explicitly state Birnbaum and Fascitelli would only cover costs for three months, the counterclaim states. As a result, their obligation for the hotel\u2019s operating costs, taxes and debt service could be interpreted as a potentially perpetual obligation until the Goodtime Hotel was in the black.\nAxelrod allegedly did not realize the mistake until 2023 when Birnbaum and Fascitelli initially decided to go ahead with a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure because Goodtime Hotel was not profitable, the counterclaim states. The attorney allegedly advised the hotel owners to \u201ckick the can\u201d until the property was stabilized. Axelrod did not respond to requests for comment.\nBirnbaum\nand Fascitelli allege the CIM affiliate has sought to capitalize on the error by refusing to correct the agreement, asserting that the hotel owners could be liable in perpetuity. The lender allegedly leveraged the erroneous payment guarantee agreement to force Birnbaum and Fascitelli into forbearance in 2023 and a $10 million supplemental guarantee, per the counterclaim.\nThe alleged mortgage default\nBirnbaum and Fascitelli accuse the CIM affiliate of repeatedly stalling their efforts to do a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure deal and initiating a UCC foreclosure action that the lender did not follow through on. The CIM affiliate also allegedly torpedoed their attempts to refinance the mortgage debt with a new lender by increasing the payoff quote by more than $20 million, the counterclaim states.\nThe CIM affiliate alleges in its lawsuit that it sent the Goodtime Hotel entity a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure notice in January, but that the owners failed to deliver closing documents and fulfill other requirements for transferring the property. A month later, after demanding the $10 million payment, the lender provided Birnbaum and Fascitelli extensions to complete the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, which they failed to meet.\nBirnbaum and Fascitelli are seeking a court order to rescind the payment guarantee agreement or allow it to be amended to include the three month requirement for the carrying costs.",

        "content": "Bridge Industrial\nis looking for a buyer for one of the largest industrial developments built in the Bay Area in the past two decades.\nThe Chicago-based logistics real estate firm is marketing Bridge Point Oakland, a 534,242-square-foot industrial park in Oakland, for sale by Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nBridge bought the Class A industrial property at 5441 International Boulevard, once a\nGeneral Electric\ntransformer manufacturing plant, in 2019 for $37.8 million. Prior to that sale, General Electric had owned the site for 70 years, though it shut down operations there in 2005. The facility sits on 24 acres and includes nearly 10,000 square feet of office space with 85 dock positions.\nBridge spent $91.6 million to redevelop the property, demolishing a majority of the former structure while maintaining its original brick facade to make way for a new industrial facility. The company broke ground on Bridge Point in 2020 to create \u201ca critical piece of infrastructure in a rapidly growing city and region that is in need of new industrial supply,\u201d Greg Woolway, a vice president at Bridge,\nsaid\nin a statement at the time. Bridge completed construction on Bridge Point Oakland in 2023.\nDemand for industrial space is on the rise, as leasing activity across the market increased 45 percent in the third quarter to 2.3 million square feet from 1.6 million square feet in the prior three months. The difference year-over-year was even more pronounced with a 97 percent jump. Of the deals signed, 74 percent were new leases. The vacancy rate for industrial space in the Bay Area was 6.4 percent in the third quarter, according to a CBRE\nreport\n,\ndown\nfrom 6.6 percent the prior quarter.\nBridge Industrial is\u00a0 building a 714,491-square-foot\nindustrial\ncampus at 2350 Qume Drive in San Jose, known as Bridge Point San Jose. That project is expected to be completed in March.\nThe company acquires, develops and operates logistics real estate in supply-constrained markets across the country and Europe, according to its website. Its only completed facility in the Bay Area at the moment is Bridge Point Silicon Valley, a 388,240-square-foot property in\nMilpitas\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "Hours after publication of my\nAug. 11 article\nabout the substantial rehabilitation of a Williamsburg rental building, I got a frantic email from a reader.\nThe building had been taken out of rent stabilization following the sub rehab and had been charging market-rate rents \u2014 a perfectly legal strategy \u2014 only for a state regulator to retroactively deny the deregulation. This would devalue the building, for which the owner had paid Jeff Sutton $9.75 million in 2023, and likely trigger a rent-overcharge lawsuit.\nThis sequence of events would wipe out the investment and lead to foreclosure, with the lender selling the property for pennies on the dollar. A real estate disaster by any definition.\nBack to the reader\u2019s email. Without revealing his specific request, to which I did not agree, I will share my takeaway from the message: Lots of real estate investors have done this and could be royally screwed.\nIf the state\u2019s regulator of rent-stabilized housing, Homes and Community Renewal, starts systematically undoing deregulations of sub-rehabbed buildings, many owners and lenders would be crushed.\nThe reader who emailed me was a longtime owner of rental buildings and was not connected to the Williamsburg building, which led me to believe he knew what he was talking about.\nTurns out, he did. On Nov. 26, my colleague Kathryn Brenzel\ncovered a lawsuit\nby the owners of 31 sub-rehabbed buildings. They want the courts to protect these investments from getting hosed by HCR the way the Williamsburg building sold by Sutton did.\nThe lawsuit didn\u2019t specify the 31 buildings; the owners want to remain anonymous to avoid retaliation. But that strategy appears to have failed: Days later Attorney General Letitia James sued Peak Capital Advisors for deregulating 159 units in\n31 buildings\nthrough sub rehabs.\nPeak hasn\u2019t acknowledged filing the November lawsuit, whose plaintiffs call themselves Balanced Housing Solutions, or BHS. (They should have picked a different name, because BHS to most real estate people means Brown Harris Stevens.) The plaintiffs say the attorney general\u2019s separate suit doesn\u2019t even acknowledge that HCR changed its policy on sub rehabs, thus unfairly portraying owners as lawbreakers.\nAt this point, only a fool would finance a sub rehab without getting a written guarantee from HCR that deregulation is allowed. But what about all the folks who have already done these projects with the assumption that the rules were the same as they had been for ages? How many hundreds of buildings are at risk?\nGiven HCR\u2019s history under Commissioner RuthAnne Visnauskas, the agency seems unlikely to give landlords the benefit of the doubt. Fortunately for owners, Visnauskas has a boss. Her name is Gov. Kathy Hochul. And she\u2019s up for re-election next year.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill owners of old apartment buildings replace gas stoves \u2014 which produce emissions that\ndamage tenants\u2019 lungs\nand also pose a fire risk \u2014 with 120-volt, battery-powered electric appliances? Because they store energy, they don\u2019t draw a lot of power at once and thus don\u2019t require electrical system upgrades. But they can still cook two Thanksgiving dinners on a single charge. Electra brags that its 120-volt induction stove costs only $3,999, versus\nCopper\u2019s $5,999 model\n. Send thoughts to eengquist@therealdeal.com.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Having employees with political differences work together might be a bad idea, based on a study of golfers. An\nanalysis\nof PGA players\u2019 results from 1997 to 2022 found that when golfers in a group were all Republicans or all Democrats, they played better. Golfers in politically mixed groups took 0.2 more strokes, on average, to finish a round. PGA group assignments are random, allowing for what economists call a natural experiment.\nElsewhere\u2026\nGood news for real estate interests who thought they were stuck with HSTPA apologist Linda Rosenthal as chair of the Assembly Housing Committee for the rest of her career: She is considering jumping to the state Senate.\nAccording to\nCity and State\n, the seat being vacated mid-term by Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal is Rosenthal\u2019s if she wants it. She wouldn\u2019t even have to win a competitive race, because in a special election such as this one, Democratic insiders can name the party\u2019s candidate.\n\u201cRosenthal has privately thought about what to do for months, but she still has not come to a decision on whether she\u2019d like to run, or stick with the Assembly, where she has worked her way up over two decades to become chair of the powerful Housing Committee,\u201d the publication wrote.\nThe Senate, which has 63 seats, is more prestigious than the Assembly, which has 150. But Rosenthal would have less say over rent stabilization, and her successor as Assembly housing chair might be more receptive to changing the HSTPA before it bankrupts and degrades more buildings.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$20.7 million\nfor a 6,500-square-foot condominium unit at 535 West End Avenue on the Upper West Side. Steven A Cohen with Corcoran had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$218.6 million\nfor the InterContinental New York Times Square at 300 West 44th Street. Tishman Realty sold the 670-room hotel to\nGencom, Highgate and Argent Ventures\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$4.8 million\nfor a 2,006-square-foot condominium unit at 250 West 96th Street on the Upper West Side. Pamela S. D\u2019Arc with Compass has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nTwo permits for a combined 400 units and 386,000 square feet were filed at 161-09 and 161-10 Hillside Avenue in Jamaica Hills. Matthew Melody with Curtis + Ginsberg Architects filed the permits on behalf of Mural Real Estate Partners.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

Weirtheim\u2019s purchase was the first home sale in Manalapan to trade above $60 million since Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison\u2019s\n$173 million acquisition\nin 2022.\nThe deed was recorded for $61.8 million, and the additional $3 million spent included furniture and other credits, according to a Corcoran Group spokesperson. Corcoran\u2019s Phil and Candace Friis represented the seller.\nThe 2-acre property includes two swimming pools, an air-conditioned garage that fits more than 13 cars, a cabana, gate house and dock with boat lifts, according to the listing agents.\nIt\u2019s one of about 60 properties in Manalapan that includes access to the ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway, connected by an underground tunnel. The house has eight bedrooms, eight bathrooms and six half-bathrooms. The property includes 160 feet of water frontage.\nThe trust previously paid $28 million for the property in 2021, which means it more than doubled in value in four years.\nLast year, Wertheim\npaid $38 million\nfor the waterfront house at 305 Indian Road in Palm Beach. Developer Todd Glaser sold him the property. Wertheim founded and leads Brain Power, the largest producer of optical tints for eyeglasses, and has a net worth of $3.9 billion, according to Forbes, down about $2 billion since last year.\nBuyers like Manalapan because the properties are larger than Palm Beach but still close to landmarks such as President Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club, agents say. Ellison, one of the richest people in the world, is doubling down on his investment in Manalapan: Last year, he paid\n$277.4 million\nfor the Eau Palm Beach Resort &amp; Spa.\u00a0Earlier this year, WeatherTech founder David MacNeil spent an additional\n$55.5 million\non oceanfront property in Manalapan.

        "content": "The area surrounding the Metro A Line\u2019s Lake station in\nPasadena\ncould look different if the city signs off on a proposal from 4D Development.\nThe Pasadena Design Commission is set to review a plan from a\n4D Development &amp; Investment\naffiliate to build a mixed-use apartment building at 490 North Lake Avenue, Urbanize Los Angeles\nreported\n.\n4D Development\u2019s plan calls for the construction of a seven-story building with 149 studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments above 9,298 square feet of ground-floor retail and parking for 135 vehicles. The Kevin Tsai Architecture-designed building would span 129,953 square feet.\nOf the 149 units, 23 would be set aside for low- and moderate-income households. In Los Angeles County, this is generally defined as making a maximum of between $84,850 and $89,550 for one person annually, or between $121,150 and $127,900 for a household of four. By including the affordable units, the project is eligible for density bonus incentives, permitting the developer to build more units than zoning regulations would typically allow.\nThe project will be presented to the Pasadena Design Commission for a preliminary consultation. A final vote on the development has not been scheduled.\n4D Development has been active with other\nmultifamily\nprojects in the Los Angeles area. In 2023 the firm completed the E on Adams mixed-use development at\n5181 West Adams Boulevard\n. That project comprises a six-story building with 115 studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments above about 16,600 square feet of ground-floor retail and a 46-car garage.\nIn October, the Los Angeles City Council upheld the City Planning Commission\u2019s approval of 4D Development\u2019s proposed mixed-use residential project in\nBeverly Grove\n. 4D\u2019s endeavor will replace a stretch of commercial buildings at 8251-8271 West Melrose Avenue with a six-story building featuring 90 one- and two-bedroom apartments atop 15,271 square feet of ground-floor retail and a 96-car parking garage. That project, similar to its plans in Pasadena, will include affordable housing set aside for very-low-income residents in exchange for density bonus incentives.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Just months after buying the retail portion of\nTribune Tower\n, North American Real Estate is expanding into Chicago neighborhood shopping, snapping up a three-building portfolio on the North Side.\nThe Chicago-based investor last week acquired three single-tenant retail properties along Southport Avenue in Lakeview, principal Savas Er told CoStar, which first\nreported\nthe deal. The buildings, at 3337, 3358 and 3435 North Southport Avenue, sit a few blocks southwest of Wrigley Field in a bustling stretch of shops and restaurants.\nThe price was not disclosed and has not yet appeared in public records. The seller was Newcastle Investors, another Chicago firm, which was represented by Mid-America Real Estate brokers Joe Girardi, Emily Gadomski and Patrick Corrigan.\nThe deal gives North American a foothold on a corridor that landlords covet for one simple reason: It\u2019s fully leased. CoStar reported that Southport Avenue between Addison and Roscoe streets has so far recorded zero vacant retail spaces in each of the past two years, according to Stone Real Estate\u2019s annual survey.\nThe three Southport Avenue buildings total about 20,000 square feet and are fully leased. The 8,692-square-foot property at 3435 North Southport is occupied by Capital One Caf\u00e9, while Tuco &amp; Blondie leases the 8,200-square-foot building at 3358 North Southport. Indira Salon &amp; Spa occupies the 3,350-square-foot building at 3337 North Southport, according to a Mid-America marketing brochure.\nThe Southport acquisition follows North American\u2019s purchase earlier this year of the retail component of Tribune Tower, as well as its purchase of the fully leased, multi-tenant Point at Clark property in Lakeview. Together, the moves highlight a strategy focused on dense neighborhoods and high-traffic retail strips.\nEr told CoStar that the timing reflects a broader shift in tenant sentiment, even in parts of Chicago that have struggled in recent years. He pointed to conversations with retailers at last week\u2019s International Council of Shopping Centers conference in\nNew York\n, where interest in the city appeared to be heating up.\nThe sale also continues a gradual pruning of Newcastle\u2019s\nportfolio\n. The firm bought the three Southport properties in separate deals in 2004, 2005 and 2015 for a combined $9 million, according to CoStar data. In recent years, it has been an active seller, including a $39 million disposition of retail at 1120 and 1130 North State Street in the\nGold Coast\n, where buyer Convexity Properties is expected to pursue a residential tower with new retail. Newcastle last year also sold adjacent apartment buildings in Rogers Park for nearly $17 million.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The sellers of the 173-unit property at 2131 Crestview Lane were James Busby and Irwin Deutscher, records show.\nLido Square was at risk of losing its affordable status if state agencies didn\u2019t step in, according to a report from a meeting\no\nf the\nCalifornia Debt Limit Allocation Committee and California Tax Credit Allocation Committee\nearlier this year.\nThey recommended tax credits that will preserve affordability for another 55 years.\nThe 173 units at Lido Square consist of 171 affordable units and two manager\u2019s units.

In Contra Costa County, that\napplies\nto individuals making between $33,600 and $87,550, or $47,950 and $125,050 for a household of four.\nThe deal to keep the apartments affordable is contingent on a budget set by the California Debt Limit Allocation Committee. That $149.1 million budget includes the $90 million purchase price, $23.1 million in renovation and rehabilitation costs and a $17.4 million developer fee.\nReliant Group Management secured $11 million in financing from the California Housing Finance Agency to help fund the acquisition. Reliant Group plans to take on renovation and rehabilitation work at Lido Square.\nThe California Debt Limit Allocation Committee and\nother state agencies provide funding\nor other favorable tax vehicles to support affordable residential projects across the state.

        "content": "Construction is officially underway on the first phase of Haggard Farm, a long-planned $750 million mixed-use development that aims to remake one of the largest undeveloped tracts left in\nPlano\n.\nWork began last week on the initial phase of the project at the southeast corner of Parkwood Boulevard and Spring Creek Parkway, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The opening salvo will include about 100,000 square feet of retail, 350 multifamily units, 188 townhomes, hike-and-bike trails and a 3-acre park. Vertical construction on the retail buildings is expected to take roughly 14 months, with residential pre-leasing slated to begin about the same time. Phase one is expected to take about two years to complete.\nDallas-based\nStillwater Capital Investments\nis developing the 142-acre site along the Dallas North Tollway, and broke ground on early infrastructure in 2023. The project has been in the works for years and finally brings large-scale development to land that remained mostly untouched for more than a century.\nPlano, the largest city in Collin County, has a population north of 290,000 and is already packed with corporate campuses and mixed-use projects. Median home values hover at about $410,000.\nStillwater\nmanaging director Clay Roby said in a statement that Haggard family\u2019s homestead existed on the development site for 170 years.\n\u201cThe seeds for this development were planted generations ago,\u201d Roby said.\nWhen fully built out, Haggard Farm\u2019s plans include roughly 200,000 square feet of retail, 700 apartments, 650,000 square feet of office space, a boutique hotel with a private social club and about 10 acres of green space. Retail anchors will include The Almanac 1856, an 8,000-square-foot farm-to-table restaurant and bar, and Haggard Hall, a 16,000-square-foot event barn. Both are expected to open in fall 2027.\nStillwater is partnering with Dallas-based Woodhouse on experiential elements, and with The Retail Connection on leasing. About 40 percent of the retail mix is slated for food and beverage, with an emphasis on vendors that sell what they produce. Plans call for gardens attached to restaurants, along with nods to the site\u2019s agricultural past, including orchards, a fishing pond and even livestock.\nOffices will come later, with build-to-suit opportunities planned for corporate users. Roby said designs and permits are already in hand, with marketing expected to begin in early 2026.\nThe Haggard family, which has owned the land since the mid-1800s, secured city approval in 2021 after discussions dating back to 2019. Historic structures on the property, including a mid-1850s home and a relocated schoolhouse, will be preserved and folded into the project \u2014 a nod to Plano\u2019s past meeting its next wave of\ngrowth\n.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "New York office leasing finally\nshook out\nof its pandemic-era rut in 2025.\nIn the year that JP Morgan opened its new\n$3 billion headquarters\nat 270 Park Avenue as the ne plus ultra of the workplace, tenants showed that the office is not, in fact, dead.\nThe kinds of mega-deals that epitomized office leasing\u2019s boom years (we\u2019re looking at you, NYU, taking 1 million square feet) are back, and they\u2019re helping drive the market to record numbers.\nManhattan was on track in December to top 40 million square feet worth of deals for the year, which would be the first time it crossed that number since 2019.\nAll that activity is helping take a bite out of the glut of space left in the wake of the shutdown: Manhattan availability came down to 14.2 percent in December, according to Colliers. That\u2019s the lowest level since late 2020.\nHere are the biggest office leasing deals of 2025.\n1) New York University | 770 Broadway | 1,067,383 sf\nSteve Roth\u2019s Vornado Realty Trust set the tone for the year in the spring, when\nit signed\nNYU to a 1.1 million-square-foot master lease at its 770 Broadway building in Greenwich Village.\nThe school said the space will be a hub for engineering, science and technology, converting the vacant floors to laboratories, classrooms and workstations. NYU has plans to eventually move some departments from rented space elsewhere as existing leases expire.\nFor its part, Vornado used some of the $935 million upfront payment NYU made to repay the property\u2019s $700 million mortgage. The lease has a 70-year term with options for NYU to buy the office portion of the building in 2055 and at the end of the lease.\nIt was the biggest lease in Manhattan since 2018 when WarnerMedia (formerly known as Time Warner) inked a deal for 1.5 million square feet in Related Companies and Oxford Properties Group\u2019s 30 Hudson Yards.\n2) Jane Street Capital | 250 Vesey Street | 1,000,000 sf\nJane Street Capital inked a new megalease at Brookfield Properties\u2019 250 Vesey Street, where the quant trading firm has been growing for the past decade.\nThe firm\nsigned\na new long-term lease for 1 million square feet at the Brookfield Place building in a 400,000-square-foot expansion. The company had originally relocated to the property in 2014 when it signed on for about 117,000 square feet, growing over the years to 600,000 before the recent deal.\nJane Street\u2019s expansion was so big that Brookfield had to relocate its own corporate offices in the building in order to make way for the trading firm\u2019s growing space.\n3) Deloitte | 70 Hudson Yards | 807,000 sf\nRelated Companies\nsigned\nthe accounting and consulting firm Deloitte as the anchor tenant for its latest Hudson Yards tower.\nDeloitte agreed to lease 800,000 square feet at 70 Hudson Yards, the 47-story, 1.1-million-square-foot building Related broke ground on in June. The new tower will include a large event space, private dining, a media-podcast studio and \u201cred eye\u201d suites for use after flights.\nDeloitte\u2019s big lease is a sign that major companies want to occupy high-quality spaces as they bring workers back to the office, and it\u2019s one of a handful of deals in 2025 that helped kick off new office developments.\n4) Citadel | 660 Fifth Avenue | 502,528 sf\nSpeaking of development-driving tenants, Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel (which in 2022 partnered with Vornado and Rudin to kick off 350 Park Avenue) is still hungry for more space.\nThe market-making securities firm\nsigned on\nfor 504,000 square feet at Brookfield Properties\u2019 660 Fifth Avenue. The owner recently completed a $400 million redevelopment and modernization of the 1.25 million-square-foot building formerly known as 666 Fifth.\nCitadel is expected to move from one of its current locations at 350 Park Avenue, which will be torn down (along with 40 E. 52nd Street) and redeveloped by Vornado and Rudin as a 1.8 million-square-foot, 1,600-foot-tall tower designed by Foster + Partners.\nCitadel signed on as the anchor tenant, agreeing to take about 850,000 square feet.\n5) United Nations Association | Two United Nations Plaza | 425,190 sf\nThe United Nations consolidated its office space as part of a $500 million development plan for One and Two United Nations Plaza.\nThe U.N. signed a lease for 425,190 square feet of space across 26 stories at 2 United Nations Plaza, in addition to two stories of retail at 1 United Nations Plaza.\nThe landlord is the United Nations Development Corporation, a public benefit corporation established by New York State.

        "content": "Texas is still waiting for snow, but the data center cascade doesn\u2019t show signs of stopping.\nIn December alone, the combined construction budget for new data centers in Texas exceeds $1.4 billion, according to Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation filings. That\u2019s over 40 percent of the total $3.4 billion cost of new data center construction projects registered in 2025.\nWhile data center speculators are\nbullish\non the\nPermian Basin\n\u2014 an energy-rich, sparsely populated region in Far West Texas \u2014 this month\u2019s projects are more centrally located in the state, with two in the Texas Triangle.\nFacebook is spending $197 million to add a 145,00-square-foot, single-story data center to its\ncomplex in Temple\n, a city between Austin and Waco on the I-35 corridor, according to a filing that scheduled the project\u2019s start date as Monday of this week. The building at 2230 Eberhardt Road is slated for completion in September.\nThe most expensive of these projects all year is in Midlothian, just south of Dallas/Fort Worth, where Google has budgeted $880 million for a one-story, 288,000-square-foot data center. Demand for data centers put\nDFW in second place nationally among data center markets\nin 2024, according to CBRE.\nAnd in Haskell, a Panhandle Plains town more than two hours west of Fort Worth, Google began work on a $350 million, 350,000-square-foot project this month. It\u2019s the company\u2019s second data center project in the area, following plans for a 280,000-square-foot building filed earlier this year. The facilities are going up near a new solar and battery storage plant, according to Google.\nHaskell is West Texas, but it\u2019s not Far West Texas, where cloud computing company CoreWeave and Poolside, a Nvidia-backed startup, are planning a\n500-acre data center named Horizon\n. Capitalizing on the promise of cheap power offered by the Permian Basin\u2019s oil and natural gas reserves, Horizon will generate its own electricity.\n",

The interests in the hospitality properties are located in 17 states across the country, including more than a dozen in New York City.\nThe portfolio is derived from Sonder\u2019s business model, which saw it sign long-term leases with apartment and hotel owners, then turning around and renting out units as short-term rentals.\nInterested parties can put in bids for as many or as few leasehold interests as they\u2019d like. But they need to act quickly, as the first round of bids is due by Dec. 30.\n\u201cGordon Brothers has been fully engaged in this process and we are confident that their team will provide valuable assistance to maximize value for the estates,\u201d said the trustee managing Sonder\u2019s wind-down.\nSonder bit the dust a little more than a month ago, announcing plans for an immediate end to operations and the pursuit of Chapter 7 liquidation of its United States business.\nThe announcement came one day after Sonder\u2019s partnership with Marriott International\ncollapsed\n; Marriott terminated its licensing agreement with Sonder, alleging the short-term operator was in default on an agreement signed last year.\n\u201cWe are devastated to reach a point where a liquidation is the only viable path forward,\u201d interim chief executive officer Janice Sears said in a statement at the time.\nThe company\u2019s market value before the shutdown announcement was $6.79 million, according to LSEG, a far drop from the $2.2 billion valuation at the time of its initial public offering in 2021.\nIn its final quarterly report, Sonder noted \u201csubstantial doubt\u201d about its ability to remain as a going concern. As of the end of June, Sonder counted $1 billion of assets and $1.5 billion in liabilities.\nThe U.S. Bankruptcy Court\napproved\nthe sale of Sonder\u2019s assets last week.

        "content": "More than three dozen owners of marquee commercial properties are suing Broward County Property Appraiser Marty Kiar, alleging his office improperly calculated market and assessed values, saddling them with inflated tax bills.\nThe lawsuits, filed between November and this month in Broward County Circuit Court, involve some of the county\u2019s best-known hotels, office towers and retail complexes.\nThe properties are in\nFort Lauderdale\n, Hallandale Beach, Hollywood, Pompano Beach and other major Broward cities.\nThe cases challenge how Kiar\u2019s office valued high-profile commercial real estate assets across sectors, from hospitality and gaming to Class A office and regional retail.\nThe property owners allege the appraiser\u2019s methodologies overstate real market value, which in turn drove up their property taxes.\nMany of the complaints were filed during a narrow legal window tied to the certification of the tax roll, after challenges to the county\u2019s value adjustment board. The timing of the litigation reflects the certification deadline rather than an unusual spike in controversy, said Mila Schwartzreich, general counsel for the Broward property appraiser.\nProperty owners have 60 days from the date the value adjustment board certifies the tax rolls to file lawsuits. They are prohibited from doing so once the 60-day deadline expires, Schwartzreich said.\nEach county certifies its tax roll on a different schedule, so litigation waves often track those calendars rather than broader market shifts, she said.\nBroward processes significantly more parcels than some entire states, but relatively few assessments end up in court compared to other Florida counties, including Miami-Dade, she said.\nMost of the plaintiffs are represented by Samuel Brandan Lynch, a shareholder with the Orlando-based law firm Lowndes. He told\nThe Real Deal\nhe is not authorized to comment on the cases.\nAmong the owners suing Kiar\u2019s office are Trinity Investments, led by Sean Hehir, and Credit Suisse, which own the Diplomat Beach Resort Hollywood. The property appraiser determined the oceanfront, 1,000-room hotel at 3555 Ocean Drive in Hollywood had a market and assessed value of $589.9 million in 2024, court records show. The owners paid roughly $12.3 million in property taxes.\nIn 2023, Trinity and Credit Suisse paid roughly\n$850 million\nfor the resort and two adjacent parcels that the partnership subsequently sold to Aventura-based BH Group and Coconut Grove-based Related Group.\nOther notable plaintiffs include:\nAn affiliate of New York-based Brookfield, led by Bruce Fiatt, which owns the\nHilton Fort Lauderdale Marina\n, a 595-room hotel at 181 Southeast 17th Street. Kiar\u2019s office determined the property had a market value of $140.3 million and an assessed value of $139.9 million in 2024. The owner paid $2.6 million in property taxes. In 2018, Brookfield paid $170.6 million for the hotel.\nAn affiliate of Russell Galbut\u2019s Miami-based GFO Investments, Fort Lauderdale-based InSite Group, Atlas Hill Real Estate and Prime Finance. The joint venture owns Galleria Fort Lauderdale, an indoor mall at 2414 East Sunrise Boulevard that Kiar\u2019s office determined had a market value $74.4 million and an assessed value $74.3 million in 2024. The partnership paid $101,215 in property taxes. The joint venture acquired the mall for\n$73 million\nin September.\nAn affiliate of The Stronach Group, led by Belinda Stronach, which owns\nGulfstream Park\nat 901 South Federal Highway in Hallandale Beach. The property appraiser determined the gambling, retail and entertainment site has a market value of $87.4 million and an assessed value of $85.7 million in 2024. Stronach\u2019s affiliate paid $1.3 million in property taxes.\nAn affiliate of Fort Lauderdale-based Stiles Corporation, led by Kenneth Stiles. The development firm owns the\nAutoNation office building\nat 200 Southwest First Avenue in Fort Lauderdale. Kiar\u2019s office determined the property had a market value of $78.6 million and an assessed value of $72.8 million in 2024. The Stiles affiliate paid $1.4 million in property taxes.",

Air quality, access to open space and potential displacement of residents and businesses are top concerns.\n\u201cThe rezoning represents a wholescale departure from longstanding public policy that respects air quality, health concerns, open space, air and light, stress on sensitive historical sites, socioeconomic displacement and priorities for affordable housing,\u201d the lawsuit states.\nMudd faces an uphill battle. Jack Lester, an attorney who\nfiled unsuccessful lawsuits\ncontesting City of Yes and the recent charter revision ballot questions, is arguing the nonprofit\u2019s case on similar grounds to those dismissed cases.\nIn August, the City Council unanimously approved the Midtown South Mixed-Use Plan, rezoning 42 blocks in the Midtown neighborhood for housing development. It\u2019s expected to result in 9,535 housing units \u2014 2,842 set aside as affordable \u2014 representing the city\u2019s largest residential rezoning in 20 years.\nThe rezoning created two new high-density residential\ndistricts\nthat require Mandatory Inclusionary Housing and also allowed for the construction of housing projects up to 15 and 18 times the size of their lots. It was the first time that these districts were used after the state lifted the city\u2019s long-standing cap on residential floor area ratio of 12.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A long-dormant Gold Coast development site could finally get moving again.\nConvexity Properties wants to build a 28-story apartment tower at the corner of State and Elm streets in Chicago, reviving a prominent parcel where a previous owner\u2019s high-rise plan stalled for four years. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat the developer unveiled its proposal during an online community meeting Monday hosted by 2nd Ward Alderman Brian Hopkins\u2019 office.\nConvexity\n, the real estate arm of Chicago-based trading firm DRW Holdings, is planning a 307-unit apartment tower at 1120 and 1130 North State Street. The firm bought the site for $39 million\nin August\nfrom\nNewcastle Investors\n, which had secured Chicago City Council approval in 2021 for a slightly taller project, but never broke ground.\nNewcastle\u2019s approved plan called for a 304-unit, 345-foot tower. Convexity\u2019s version would top out at about 312 feet and feature a different design: two interlocking L-shaped towers rising from a multi-story podium containing nearly 24,000 square feet of retail space.\nWhy Newcastle walked away remains unclear, but interest rates, surging construction costs and a tougher capital markets environment have knocked out numerous Chicago proposals since the pandemic. The result has been a thin development pipeline, with fewer than 600 new rental units expected to deliver across downtown in 2026, the outlet reported.\nConvexity is now shopping for financing, director Chris Oakley told the publication, though he declined to disclose estimated development costs, adding that the\nGold Coast\nsite is in a prominent locale.\nThe site is currently occupied by a vacant two-story former Barnes &amp; Noble that has sat dark for years, along with a Lou Malnati\u2019s restaurant at 1120 North State Street. That lease expires in summer 2026 without an extension option, though Oakley said the pizza chain could reappear in the new retail space.\nThe apartment mix would include studios, one-, two- and three-bedroom units. Convexity plans to designate eight apartments as affordable and pay roughly $4.5 million in in-lieu fees under the city\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance, rather than providing more on-site affordable housing.\nBecause the zoning was already approved for Newcastle\u2019s project, Convexity does not need a new City Council vote. The plan still requires administrative approval from the Department of Planning and Development to confirm zoning compliance.\nHopkins said the earlier proposal faced some neighborhood resistance, forcing a height reduction, but there\u2019s broad agreement that the long-languishing vacant retail site has become a problem.\nIf approved, Convexity aims to start construction in June and complete the tower in spring 2028. The firm has a track record nearby, including the Viceroy Hotel next door and the condo building at 4 East Elm Street.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The project is being developed in a nod toward Allapattah\u2019s growth as an arts and culture district.\nThe project marks a new partnership between\nCalderon\nand the\nRubells\n, both powerhouses in the Allapattah neighborhood. It also comes amid a South Florida multifamily\nslowdown\ndue to hefty deliveries of new units in the past two years, and a calmer influx of out-of-staters, leading to slower lease-ups and more concessions.\nDevelopers have argued the market will\npick up\nby the time they finish their apartment projects in the coming years.\nThe Rubell family owns the 1-acre development site where the first highrise is planned, property records show. The land also is near the\nRubell Museum\n, a 100,000-square-foot art campus with 33 galleries in several interconnected warehouses. The museum is at 1100 Northwest 23rd Street.\nThe Rubells, who have been Miami Beach developers for years, opened their collection to the public in 1993 in Miami\u2019s Wynwood. Over the past decade, Wynwood was supercharged as an arts district and real estate market, and the Rubells moved their collection to Allapattah in 2019, where they\u2019ve also been amassing properties.\nSimkins\u2019 Lion has partnered on projects elsewhere in Miami, including the 659-unit\n38 West Eleventh Residences Miami\ncondo tower with PMG and Marc Roberts, one of a slew of towers the trio plans.\nAllapattah, traditionally a Dominican enclave where the primary industry once was fruitpacking, has attracted developers\u2019 and gallerists\u2019 eyes.\nIn Allapattah, Calderon\u2019s completed apartment projects in recent years include the 192-unit\nNo. 17 Residences\n, finished in 2021; the 323-unit\nThe Julia Residences\n, which was finished this year; and the 237-unit\nFourteen Main Street Residences\n, also completed this year.\n",

        "content": "Just as one lawsuit clears up for Ruben Espinoza, another one takes its place.\nThe Florida-based real estate investor is currently involved in at least six ongoing lawsuits related to his business dealings in the Chicago area while facing default judgments in two others.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of his active and recently resolved legal disputes related to Chicago-area commercial property deals.\nPartners turn on each other at 300 West Adams\nEspinoza and Chicago-based investor Igor Gabal scored the deal of a lifetime in late 2023 when they bought a struggling office building at 300 West Adams\nfor $4 million or $17 a foot\n.\nBut after\nsuccessfully fighting off a legal challenge\nfrom\na pair of investors\nwho claimed they were cut out of a deal to buy the building, Espinoza and Gabal\nturned on each other\n.\nEspinoza filed a lawsuit against Gabal in May, claiming he had mishandled a $6.2 million insurance payout and should no longer have access to their shared bank accounts.\nAs the legal drama dragged on over the past year, Gabal\u2019s defense requested that a judge dismiss the lawsuit altogether because he claimed that Espinoza has been exhibiting the same behavior that he is accusing Gabal of engaging in.\nGabal claimed in a filing last month that Espinoza should not be granted sole access to their shared bank accounts because he has allegedly siphoned off $1.5 million without Gabal\u2019s consent.\nThe lawsuit is still pending in Cook County Circuit Court.\nEspinoza didn\u2019t return a request for comment and neither did his attorneys regarding this dispute or any others mentioned in this story.\nLender wins receiver request amid a $68M foreclosure dispute\nIf Espinoza has any hope of hanging onto a portfolio of Southwest Side commercial buildings, it is likely dwindling.\nLast month, a judge appointed receiver Scott Shefman of Friedman Real Estate Management to take control of Espinoza\u2019s portfolio of two commercial buildings amid an ongoing foreclosure dispute filed by Wilmington National Trust.\nEspinoza\nhas defaulted on $68 million in mortgage debts\nhe took on for commercial complexes on Chicago\u2019s Southwest Side, according to Wilmington.\nHe allegedly owes more than $43 million, including interest and fees, for the Chicago Business Center, a 661,000-square-foot mixed-use building with office space and a distribution facility at 2600 West 35th Street.\nThe remaining $24 million he owes is tied to a 110,000-square-foot distribution center just across the Chicago River to the northwest, at 2455 South Damen Avenue.\nIndian Lakes Hotel heads to court for a second time\nEspinoza\u2019s plans to revive a storied suburban hotel along with hospitality magnate Robert Habeeb quickly went south last year when lender CRE Bridge Capital foreclosed on the property, alleging that the pair of investors had\ndefaulted on a $3.5 million bridge loan\non the property known as The Indian Lakes Hotel.\nSoon after, the lender sold the vacant hotel to the village of Bloomingdale for $5 million.\nBut Espinoza and Habeeb\u2019s involvement with the hotel didn\u2019t end there.\nThe pair are suing CRE Bridge Capital, led by Daniel Sobelman, in a complaint filed last month alleging that the lender never had the legal standing to file the foreclosure and ultimately sell the property.\nEspinoza and Habeeb allege payment statements CRE Bridge Capital issued to the borrowers were \u201cuntimely, inaccurate and in some cases, incomprehensible.\u201d\nAs a result, CRE Bridge Capital \u201cmanufactured a breach of loan agreement \u2026 to seize Plaintiff\u2019s real estate in a collusive UCC sale for a pittance,\u201d Espinoza and Habeeb argue.\nThe lawsuit claims the property could have been worth up to $70 million after Espinoza and Habeeb completed their redevelopment plans.\nA hearing on the matter is scheduled for January 14.\nA state senator\u2019s property tax law firm scores a win\nEspinoza\u2019s legal troubles entered the political realm earlier this year.\nState Sen. Robert F. Martwick Jr., who represents Illinois\u2019 10th Senate District\nfiled a lawsuit against Espinoza earlier\nin July for failing to pay Martwick\u2019s law firm, Finkel, Martwick &amp; Colson.\nMartwick\u2019s firm claimed it was owed more than $1 million by Espinoza and his real estate ventures.\nThe law firm netted property tax savings for the landlord at big Chicago buildings, all of which are now subject to foreclosure proceedings. Finkel\u2019s contracts with Espinoza, which were signed by Martwick, pertain to its tax work for each of the last four years, according to the complaint filed in Cook County court in July.\nIn October, a judge issued a default order, requiring Espinoza to pay the law firm $631,000 in damages.\nAnother portfolio faces foreclosure\nIn another foreclosure case, Espinoza is fighting back.\nHe is\nfacing a foreclosure lawsuit\nover a $9.6 million loan he took on for a set of River North loft office buildings at 215-223 West Ohio Street.\nRialto Capital filed the foreclosure in March, but rather than give up the keys, Espinoza is disputing the foreclosure.\nThe case is still pending.\nA commercial tenant claims fraud\nFor the second time, a commercial tenant is claiming Espinoza took a deposit and first month\u2019s rent but never allowed them to move in.\nProduce wholesaler Galfresh Produce signed a lease with Espinoza to move into one of his commercial spaces but, the company alleges in a June lawsuit, it was never granted access to the space.\nThe Damen avenue commercial building is the same property currently being foreclosed on by Wilmington Trust.\nGalfresh is suing Espinoza in an effort to recoup its $98,000 deposit and the $49,000 the company put down as first month\u2019s rent.\nThe dispute mirrors\na similar lawsuit filed by a local soccer club\nlast year that claimed Espinoza also took a deposit and first month of rent for a space that was occupied by another tenant who had no plans to move out. That case was dismissed without prejudice but re-filed in October 2025 with the soccer club\u2019s lawyer alleging it still hadn\u2019t been paid back.\nIn October, a judge ordered Espinoza pay Galfresh back but Espinoza is fighting that order, claiming he was never properly served.\nA personal loan goes unpaid\nAs Espinoza forged ahead in his other legal battles, he was hit with another filing December 5.\nAn entity known as Ohio Street Investments claims that Espinoza has failed to pay back a $350,000 personal loan that Ohio Street Investments issued to him in late 2022.\nThe case is pending.\n",

        "content": "A long-vacant office tower in downtown Galveston is finally poised for a comeback, with plans to reopen as a boutique hotel after sitting empty for decades.\nPort Arthur-based Itex Group expects to kick off construction in February on the historic Medical Arts Building at 302 Moody Avenue, redeveloping the 11-story structure into a 120-room hotel dubbed The Quay,\naccording\nto the Houston Business Journal. The project hinges on recently secured city permits and would mark the closest the property has come to redevelopment since the 1980s.\nThe hotel will join Hilton\u2019s Tapestry Collection, a brand aimed at locally styled, independent properties, with Florida-based\nDriftwood Hospitality Management\ntapped to operate it, the outlet reported. Plans call for a mix of suites and rooms, along with a ground-floor restaurant and bar. Itex is targeting a January 2028 opening.\nThe building\u2019s site is part of the bet. Sitting at the edge of The Strand district and within a few blocks of Galveston\u2019s cruise terminals and Pier 21, the property is aimed to capture leisure travelers and event-driven demand, as well as business tied to nearby corporations and the\nUniversity of Texas Medical Branch\n.\nItex bought the property in 2016 intending to convert it into apartments, an idea previously floated by former owner Andy Vickery, who also explored a timeshare concept, according to the Galveston County Daily News. The pandemic ultimately pushed Itex to abandon the residential plan in favor of hospitality, which CEO Chris Akbari said now pencils out better, given Galveston\u2019s tourism and cruise traffic.\nThe Medical Arts Building dates to 1929 and was developed by William L. Moody Jr.\u2019s American National Insurance Company as an annex to its nearby headquarters. Once home to medical offices, the tower has been vacant since the 1980s and has deteriorated significantly. Parts of the exterior have fallen away, windows are missing and the interior was fully gutted years ago.\nItex plans to tackle the exterior first before rebuilding the interior, balancing historic preservation with modern hotel layouts.\nHouston-based MCS Architects\nis designing the project, while a general contractor has yet to be selected.\nThe redevelopment would land amid a broader refresh of Galveston\u2019s hotel stock. Several marquee properties have recently undergone renovations, including Tremont House and Grand Galvez, while Hotel Lucine reopened in 2023 after decades as a roadside motel, according to the publication. On the island\u2019s East Beach, Dallas-based\nRREAF Holdings\nis pushing ahead with a $700 million Margaritaville resort and residential project.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The fresh financing replaces a $170 million loan from real estate finance and investment management firm PCCP.\nA Walker &amp; Dunlop team including Aaron Appel, Jonathan Schwartz and Keith Kurland arranged the loan on behalf of the landlord.\nThe refinancing follows a $107 million capital improvement program that transformed the landmarked 278,000-square-foot property into a loft-style Class A office building.

        "content": "As Netflix and Paramount fight to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, Hackman Capital Partners is bracing for impact.\nLos Angeles-based Hackman, the largest independent owner and operator of soundstages, is facing high studio vacancy rates and depressed rents, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. The firm owns more than 60 soundstages at six studio properties in the L.A. region but has seen occupancy shift as more productions move outside the city.\nRegardless of whether Netflix or Paramount emerges as the buyer of Warner Bros. Discovery, demand for soundstage space will likely drop as Warner Bros. owns a large amount of\nits own studio real estate\n, leading the new buyer to shift production from leased stages to its owned facilities.\n\u201cThe whole ecosystem is really under distress,\u201d Michael Hackman, CEO of Hackman Capital, told the Journal.\nFilm and TV productions are pursuing cheaper labor and filming costs overseas as countries like Canada,\nAustralia\nand some European nations offer incentives to work there instead.\nHackman is hopeful that the\nTrump\nadministration will back the U.S. entertainment business with tariffs on countries offering these incentives and tax breaks for productions that stay local for filming. \u201cA lot is going to depend on support from the government helping to offset some of these advantages they have outside the U.S.,\u201d Hackman said.\nHackman began investing heavily in\nstudio ownership\na decade ago with its acquisition of Culver Studios in 2014. Since then, the firm has bought more than 2 million square feet of production space worldwide, most of it in the Los Angeles region. The 2023 writers\u2019 and actors\u2019 strikes led to increased studio cost-cutting, reflected in the exodus to other filming locations today.\nLast year saw nearly 30 percent fewer big-budget U.S. film and TV projects begin shooting compared to 2022, per ProdProp data cited by the Journal. This year continued the downward trend with an additional 12 percent drop through November compared with the same period in 2024.\n\u201cWe all thought that when the strikes ended, there would be all this pent-up demand for Hollywood production,\u201d John Kim, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, told the Journal. \u201cBut it\u2019s spread out. Even though [content companies] are based in Los Angeles, they can produce anywhere globally.\u201d\nFor now, Hackman is tightening up its finances, which includes scaling back the construction of a major campus planned in the Dublin, Ireland, area. If local production in Los Angeles doesn\u2019t return to its former heights, studio landlords like Hackman may have to\nfind other uses for their soundstage campuses\n, such as live events and themed attractions based on movies.\n\u201cThe industry is evolving,\u201d Hackman said. \u201cWe can\u2019t stay passive.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Citadel is quietly pulling back further from Chicago, downsizing its remaining local operations and vacating the downtown tower that once bore its name.\nThe hedge fund is relocating what\u2019s left of its Chicago staff into roughly 50,000 square feet north of the Chicago River to 353 North Clark Street, according to people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg News\nreported\n. The new office amounts to about 10 percent of the space Citadel occupied in 2020, when it was the main tenant at the 37-story Citadel Center at\n131 South Dearborn Street\n. The Loop tower is now\non the market\nand no longer carries the firm\u2019s branding.\nThe move highlights how thoroughly billionaire founder\nKen Griffin\nhas unwound Citadel\u2019s Chicago presence since decamping to Florida. Citadel shifted its headquarters to Miami in 2022 and has steadily relocated staff to Miami and New York. The firm once employed roughly 1,100 people in Chicago. That number has dropped to about 200, according to the publication.\nGriffin\u2019s high-profile exit, driven by public complaints over taxes, crime and governance, has become a touchstone in Chicago\u2019s ongoing debate over its business climate. Mayor Brandon Johnson is now pushing a revived version of the city\u2019s controversial \u201chead tax,\u201d proposing a\n$33-per-employee levy\non companies with at least 500 workers to fund public safety. Business groups and much of the City Council oppose the idea. Former mayor Rahm Emanuel once dubbed the tax a \u201cjob killer.\u201d\nCitadel\u2019s pullback adds to a list of corporate departures that includes Boeing, Caterpillar and Tyson Foods. But Griffin\u2019s move carries outsized symbolic and economic weight, stripping the city of some of its highest-paid finance jobs and a major philanthropic benefactor. The outlet reported that Griffin donated more than $600 million to Chicago institutions, including a $125 million gift to the city\u2019s science museum, now named for him. Since relocating, he has directed hundreds of millions of dollars to Florida causes.\nThe retrenchment has rippled through real estate as well. Griffin reportedly took a roughly $30 million loss unloading six luxury condos in the Gold Coast. His final Chicago property remains unsold.\nChicago\u2019s finance sector has also felt the sting. State data show finance employment in Illinois is down nearly 3 percent since Griffin left, a blow to a city that helped invent the modern futures market and remains home to CME Group and Cboe Global Markets.\nCity Hall has pushed back on the narrative that Chicago is hostile to business. A spokesperson for Johnson told Bloomberg that Griffin left for political reasons, not economic ones, and pointed to recent large downtown leases as evidence of resilience. Still, Johnson\u2019s approval ratings have sagged, voters rejected his proposed hike to the real estate transfer tax on high-end sales, and Governor JB Pritzker vowed to veto a financial transaction tax.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",
