        "content": "On the surface, 789 MacDonough Street is a glowing example of tenants becoming owners of their neglected building.\nThe 41-unit, Bedford-Stuyvesant apartment house, built in 1930, began falling apart in the 1970s as the landlord essentially abandoned what was once a \u201cbeautiful, gorgeous building,\u201d as longtime resident Lisa Lanier\ndescribed it\n.\nThe building was aging, its regulated rents were about $200 a month, and Bed-Stuy had become something of a war zone. \u201cDo-or-die Bed-Stuy,\u201d locals called it.\n\u201cIt was like living at the OK Corral. At any given moment, shots would ring out from the corners, and people would scream and scatter,\u201d Lanier recalled in an article about Habitat for Humanity\u2019s recent repainting of the building.\nThe city foreclosed on the six-story building in 1982 for unpaid taxes and\nsold it to the tenants\nin 1989 for $10,250 \u2014 exactly $250 per unit, about the same as their monthly rent.\n\u201cHad it not been for this program, I would not have been able to purchase my own home,\u201d one of the original buyers, Emma Oliver, told Habitat magazine in a\n2008 story\nabout HDFC low-income co-ops. \u201cAnd this is a home, a place where most everyone knows everyone else. Most of my neighbors have lived here 30, 40 years. The HDFC gave us a chance to live in an affordable place that\u2019s comfortable.\u201d\nBut co-op ownership, which is often touted as a solution for neglected rentals, has not been easy for the shareholders of 789 MacDonough.\n\u201cThose were a rocky first couple of years, from \u201989 to \u201991, as we navigated the learning curve to successfully manage a 41-unit building,\u201d another resident, Corinne Douglas, said in the article. \u201cIt was a struggle to keep this building operating and in the black, and now, 30 years later, we still own it.\u201d\nIts financial struggles continue, however, in part because of Oliver, the board president from 1998 to 2016. Her reign ended when she was caught embezzling and convicted of grand larceny. In 2018, she was ordered to pay restitution of $122,680, but never did. The next year, she stopped paying maintenance fees for her unit, 1C, and has run up tens of thousands of dollars in arrears.\nWhen the co-op board asks other shareholders to catch up on their maintenance, they inevitably mention that Oliver hasn\u2019t paid, said John Thomas, who became board president last year.\n\u201cThe woman just continued to not only be here, but not pay a single cent after the theft, and just go about her business like it was nothing,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cWe wound up being almost in default. It drained most of the accounts.\u201d\nBiting the hand that fed her\nOliver, now 91 years old, extolled the virtues of her affordable building in Habitat\u2019s\n2008 story\n.\n\u201cWe have income limits we have to abide by,\u201d said Oliver, who was described as a retired nurse on disability. \u201cWe also set a limit on what shareholders can sell for\u201d \u2014 $3,000 per room to an inside buyer, $6,000 to outsiders.\nPrices are higher now, but still cheap: Unit 4G, a one-bedroom, was\nlisted last year\nfor $185,000, with maintenance of $580 per month.\nAs president, Oliver controlled the board\u2019s finances with no oversight, Thomas said, and her looting reached six figures before it was discovered. In the Habitat story, real estate lawyer Larry McGaughey had warned that the city has no enforcement mechanism for HDFCs. \u201cEach individual co-op is on its own,\u201d he said.\nBut the city did have leverage to keep 789 MacDonough affordable for future buyers. The board in 2003 signed a 30-year regulatory agreement with the city that limits shareholders\u2019 profit potential in exchange for suspension of its pre-2001 tax arrears. Among the restrictions: buyers cannot earn more than 120 percent of the area median income.\n\nThe co-op, which needed the deal to get a loan for repairs and operating expenses, also consented to financial transparency measures, such as getting city approval for every withdrawal from its reserve fund. But the embezzlement scandal happened despite the agreement, which, ironically, was signed by Emma Oliver. Now the board is fighting the city as it tries to get her out.\nCiting Oliver\u2019s unpaid maintenance, the board foreclosed on her shares and went to housing court to evict her. The case dragged on until September 2024, when it was awarded possession of Unit 1C and a judgment of $46,169 plus interest.\nThat same day, a city marshal applied for a warrant of eviction. Nearly five months passed before it was granted.\nThe process had taken years, but the co-op was about to put the embarrassing, painful episode behind it. Then, at the 11th hour, an unlikely party intervened: the city of New York.\nRather than helping 789 MacDonough Street through its crisis, as it did in the 1980s, the city went all-out to keep Oliver in the apartment she no longer owns.\nThe board is now suing the city and Oliver, alleging that shareholders of 789 MacDonough \u201care being forced to house their abuser, Ms. Oliver, at their own costs.\u201d\n\u201c[We] are not a homeless shelter,\u201d the board argued in its complaint. \u201cThe government cannot force a private cooperative \u2014 itself composed of elderly, low-income shareholders \u2014 to solve a housing problem by forfeiting its own property rights.\u201d\nFor much of this year, the Adams administration has done exactly that.\nAn elusive eviction\nThe Department of Social Services, which has been trying to find housing for Oliver, persuaded a judge this spring to appoint a guardian and issue a temporary restraining order prohibiting her eviction. A housing court judge twice postponed her removal, but on May 15 declined to do so again. The marshal scheduled her eviction for the next day.\nWhat happened next, according to the lawsuit, was extraordinary: The Department of Investigation ordered the marshal to stand down. Without court approval, the agency granted a stay of eviction to Adult Protective Services, a DSS program that landlord attorneys say is increasingly being used to stall evictions.\nOliver\u2019s ouster was rescheduled for May 21, then for May 29 and again for June 3 as the Department of Investigation kept extending the eviction \u2014 a power typically reserved for judges. DSS, meanwhile, went back to court, seeking another restraining order, which Supreme Court Justice Maria Aragona granted. Outraged, the co-op board named the judge in its lawsuit.\nThe city\u2019s Law Department and DSS did not respond to requests for comment. Text messages and a call to a number listed for Oliver were not returned.\nThe city has argued that Oliver should not have to post a bond in the case because she cannot afford it, despite her withholding maintenance fees and receiving a monthly pension and Social Security payments totaling $3,989, according to the lawsuit.\nAs for the $122,000 that Oliver pilfered, Thomas, the board president, believes she distributed much of it to relatives. Interest on her restitution to the building\u2019s insurance provider \u2014 which covered $100,000 of the co-op\u2019s loss \u2014 and to the co-op is accruing at 9 percent and has swelled her arrears to nearly $200,000.\nThe board did receive 12 months\u2019 worth of Oliver\u2019s arrears from the state\u2019s pandemic-era Emergency Rental Assistance Program before ERAP ran out of money and\nshut down\n. But the remaining arrears, restitution and interest owed to the board add up to about $90,000.\n\u201cThis is an unfair situation to us, and it\u2019s costing us a lot of money,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWe can\u2019t sell the apartment, we can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A joint venture between Beztak and Wexford Real Estate secured approval from Boca Raton\u2019s Planning and Zoning Board to expand their previously approved apartment project.\nThe approval allows Farmington Hills, Michigan-based Beztak and West Palm Beach-based Wexford to add 21 additional apartments, a fitness center and a private school to the development, which will be built inside the 21.4-acre Amtec Center business park at 6401 to 6421 Congress Avenue in\nBoca Raton\n.\nThe\nproject\n, called Bocora, was previously approved as an eight-story, 277-unit building. The Boca Raton City Council will next vote on the expansion, which the planning and zoning board greenlit at its meeting on Thursday.\nIn exchange for the extra units, the developers offered to reserve four apartments for affordable housing and include a 2,086-square-foot fitness facility. The city\u2019s commercial industrial multifamily development (CIMD) ordinance allows developers to ask for additional residential units to be built in light-industrial areas such as the Amtec Center in exchange for attainable housing and new retail.\nAmtec Center\u2019s owners also want conditional use approval for a 2,000-square-foot school for 100 students within an existing office building on site. The request would allow Xceed Preparatory Academy, which operates a hybrid tutoring facility in an Amtec Center office building, to accept school vouchers, said the project\u2019s attorney, Ele Zachariades.\nJon Ounjian, owner of an office building just north of the Amtec Center, opposed the additional units. Ounjian pointed out that the apartments will be built on a 4-acre portion of the office park. Ounjian said Bocora\u2019s vehicular traffic will adversely affect his property unless a turn lane is added.\nBoard members and planning staff were concerned that the project\u2019s planned fitness center was an amenity for Bocora residents that is being used to \u201ccheck a box\u201d for the CMID retail requirement. Board member Timothy Dornblaser said this is part of a larger pattern where developers prefer to build more residential without retail or restaurant space.\n\n\u201cAll these apartments that are going up [have] no retail, so every time someone wants a cup of coffee or breakfast or something, they are leaving the site,\u201d Dornblaser said.\nDevelopment services director Brandon Schaad said the fitness center will be required to be open to the public and staffed at least 60 hours a week. An independent business separate from the developers will operate the gym, as required by CIMD, otherwise the developers may be fined or sued by the city.\nZachariades said there will not be any need for staff since members will have a key pass to get in. \u201cIt\u2019s a small boutique gym. Most of them don\u2019t have staff at all,\u201d she said.\nSchaad said that will be determined by the time the zoning item reaches the city council. \u201cUnstaffed commercial gyms are a real thing in the world, but I\u2019m not familiar with them,\u201d he said.\nBeztak, led by Sam Beznos, and Wexford, led by Joseph Jacobs and Philip Braunstein,\nannounced plans for Bocora\nin late 2021, soon after an affiliate of Beztak acquired the northwestern portion of the Amtec Center for $12.7 million. Jupiter-based Catexor, led by Stig and Britt Wennerstrom, sold the 4-acre site. Catexor still owns the remaining 17.3 acres at the Amtec Center, including its mid-1980s office buildings.\nBoca Raton has become a hot spot for development and land investment.\nIn July,\nthe Related Group paid $50 million for a 10-acre piece of the Office Depot Campus\nwhere Related, PEBB Enterprises and BH Group are redeveloping part of the office complex into a mixed-use community with 500 apartments, 43,000 square feet of retail and a 36,400-square-foot fitness center. That same month,\nGroup P6 and Mill Creek Residential won approval to build a 306-unit apartment building\nin the downtown area from Boca Raton\u2019s Community Redevelopment Agency. In August, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints\npaid $152.5 million for the 384-unit\nDel Ola apartment complex, and that month the Boca Raton planning board\nbacked James and Marta Batmasians\u2019 plans to build a 12-story, 242-room hotel near Mizner Park\n.\nSome residents are opposing new projects. Late last month, residents collected thousands of signatures\ndemanding a referendum on a proposed 1.5-million square foot project by Terra Group and Frisbie Group\non 31 acres of public land.\n",

        "content": "A 23-story office tower on Wacker Drive in Chicago\u2019s Loop hit the market in hopes of finding an investor keen to buy at a discount through a distressed loan sale.\nBoise-based lender A10 Capital is seeking a buyer for the $27.5 million loan tied to 205 West Wacker Drive, the outstanding principal on a $35 million mortgage the property\u2019s owner, Alvarez &amp; Marsal Property Investments, took out on the building in 2015, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nA10 Capital hired JLL brokers Tom Hall, Jaime Fink and Kyle Kaminski to market the loan, providing a path for investors to acquire the building through a \u201cconsensual deed-in-lieu,\u201d in which Alvarez would surrender the property provided the loan is sold. The landlord has been in default on the mortgage since June 2024, according to JLL.\nThe 271,000-square-foot office tower was originally built in 1928 and last sold for just under $23 million in 2013, or less than $84 per square foot. At the time it was sold to Chicago-based investor Ameritus through an ownership venture, according to Cook County records. Alvarez became the manager of that venture in 2015 and refinanced the property through A10.\nAssuming a buyer for the loan note emerges and finds a way to seize the keys from Alvarez, the Wacker Drive building will mark the landlord\u2019s third Chicago property lost amid financial distress in the post-pandemic office rout.\n\nAlvarez faced a\n$22 million foreclosure lawsuit initiated last year\nby a group of bondholders in the mortgage debt for 205 West Randolph Street. The lender is set to become the owner of that 23-story, 199,000-square-foot building in coming weeks when a court finalizes a foreclosure sale that occurred this summer, according to public loan data.\nAnd earlier this year,\nAlvarez\nsold off 303 West Erie Street in River North to a joint venture of Cubed Real Estate and developer R2 for $7.5 million, half of what Alvarez paid to buy it in 2017.\nThe Wacker Drive property was last renovated in 2014 and has struggled like many\ndowntown\noffice buildings through the rise of remote work since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The building is currently 43 percent leased, according to JLL.\nIt would be a prime candidate for other uses, as existing zoning on the property would allow for multifamily or hotel conversions, according to JLL. If a developer takes on such a transformation, the property would join the slew of office-to-residential projects currently underway or proposed in the Loop and surrounding areas, some of which have snagged taxpayer subsidies.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The plan aims to breathe life into the neighborhood after restaurants closed and tourism declined during the pandemic.\nThe Fisherman\u2019s Wharf Forward project would use public investment amid growing business momentum to speed up the area\u2019s recovery. The comeback is already in motion, as visitor spending and hotel bookings are notably higher than a year ago, convention reservations are up 65 percent, and the city\u2019s Ferry Building is seeing record crowds, according to a\nstatement\nfrom Mayor Daniel Lurie\u2019s office.\nAs the\nartificial intelligence sector grows its foothold in the city\nand attracts new workers from around the world, city officials are hopeful that the Fisherman\u2019s Wharf Forward plan, in tandem with organic growth, will revitalize the neighborhood.\nPart of the plan includes turning the former site of Alioto\u2019s Restaurant on Taylor Street into a public plaza facing the lagoon that abuts Jefferson Street. The space will include picnic tables, benches facing the Bay, new-and-improved lighting and landscaping and a pop-up space for retail or beverage services.\n\nAlioto\u2019s shuttered in 2022 and the Port of San Francisco attempted to re-lease the space, with more than 20 potential tenants expressing interest. The restaurant\u2019s three-story layout and the costs of repairs and necessary code upgrades put the kibosh on leasing in any capacity, including partial or temporary uses.\nInstead, Port officials settled on creating public space to attract people to the site and boost nearby businesses.\nThe Fisherman\u2019s Wharf Forward endeavor adds to other recent efforts to revive activity in the tourist hotspot, including new leases on Jefferson Street, various pop-up activations and improvements to fishing operations at Pier 45, according to the mayor\u2019s office. The project purportedly will also support safer streets and more active public spaces.\nStructural improvements are also coming to the wharf as part of the Forward plan. This includes strengthening or replacing the seawall, flood-proofing buildings, modernizing dock space for fishing boats and upgrading public spaces. The goal with these moves is to protect the waterfront from sea level rise and earthquakes while maintaining its character for residents, fishers and tourists.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

Chalfant ruled in favor of Los Angeles officials and rejected a request from Brinah Milstein and TV producer Roy Bank to demolish Monroe\u2019s Brentwood residence, the New York Post\nreported\n. The move aligns with a City Council vote last year that protected the Spanish-style house from demolition.\nIt all started in September 2023 when Milstein and Bank\nfiled demolition plans\nfor the home at 12305 Fifth Helena Drive. The couple bought the home in July of that year for nearly $8.4 million and was able to receive a demolition permit with plans to destroy the historic home to expand its own current residence next door, Deadline\nreported\n.\nCommunity pushback was swift. Court papers from the City Attorney\u2019s Office cited by Deadline said the public overwhelmed city officials with calls and emails to \u201cexpress their dismay\u201d with the demolition plan.\nCity Council member Traci Park threw a wrench into the mix by moving to designate the home as a historic cultural landmark.

Not in the least.\u201d The lawsuit claimed \u201cthere is not a single piece of the house that includes any physical evidence that Ms. Monroe ever spent a day at the house \u2014 not a piece of furniture, not a paint chip, not a carpet, nothing.\u201d\nMonroe bought the 2,900-square-foot, four-bedroom house in February 1962 for $77,500, or the equivalent of nearly $832,000 today. The\nSome Like It Hot\nstar lived on the property for only six months before dying at the home that August at the age of 36. Milstein and Bank bought the adjoining parcel in 2016.\nThe home will remain intact for now, though it remains to be seen if it will be relocated so Milstein and Bank can move forward with their property expansion.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Estate Companies\nsecured a $60 million construction loan for a 255-unit apartment complex in Riviera Beach.\nThe deal comes amid steady lending flow in South Florida, despite elevated interest rates, skyrocketing insurance, slower lease-ups and other economic headwinds.\nSouth Miami-based Estate plans the four-story Soleste on the Trail garden-style complex with a 2-acre man-made lake in the middle of the community, according to the developer\u2019s news release. BB Americas Bank is the lender.\nJim Fried of Sandstone Realty Advisors represented Estate in the financing.\nSoleste on the Trail will consist of one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments, ranging from 700 square feet to 1,000 square feet.\nEstate, led by Robert Suris and Jeffrey Ardizon, bought the 15.8-acre development site for $8 million in 2021, records show.\nThe firm\u2019s South Florida pipeline includes around 5,000 units and 153,000 square feet of commercial space, according to the release.\n\nIn North Miami Beach, Estate is developing the 28-story, 363-unit\nSoleste on the Bay\ntower at 16375 Biscayne Boulevard. The tower is immediately south of Estate\u2019s 23-story, 367-unit\nSoleste NoMi Beach\napartment tower, which the firm completed last year.\nEstate also is developing the eight-story, 347-unit Soleste Reserve 1 apartment building with some workforce units at 5079 Southwest 48th Street in Davie, after landing a\n$78 million\nconstruction loan for the project in December. Adjacent to the building, Estate also plans the eight-story\nSoleste Reserve 2\nwith more than 300 units at 5081 Southwest 48th Street.\nLast year, Estate also scored a\n$72.5 million\nconstruction loan for the 321-unit Soleste Palm Station apartment complex with a pair of eight-story buildings 520 North Rosemary Avenue in downtown West Palm Beach.\nSouth Florida\u2019s multifamily market has slowed compared to the boom during the first three years after the pandemic\u2019s onset. More recently, developers completed a\nrecord number of units\n, which led to slower lease-ups, more concessions and a flatlining \u2013\u2013 and even a decline \u2013\u2013 in rents.\nYet, developers have continued to start apartment projects and score\nconstruction loans\n, saying that the supply overhang will be absorbed and demand will come back by the time they finish their new buildings.\nTrammell Crow Residential landed\n$66.4 million\nlast month to develop a 338-unit Alexan-branded apartment complex with five five-story buildings at 785-795 South State Road 7 and an adjacent empty lot in Margate.\nIn West Palm Beach, Immocorp Ventures is developing a 382-unit apartment complex with three buildings at 2484 Pinewood Avenue in the Northwood District, after scoring a\n$117 million\nconstruction loan in June.\n",

        "content": "Ken Mattson, the Sonoma County real estate developer at the center of a high-profile Ponzi scheme lawsuit, was involved in a terrifying car crash near his home in Sonoma.\nMattson was driving a 2025 GMC Sierra last Friday at around 2:15 p.m. when he plowed through a gate and fence, then drove through a horse pasture and crashed into a tree, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n.\nThe accident happened near Mattson\u2019s home in Sonoma on Vineyard Lane at Bartholomew Road, near the historic Haraszthy Villa and Bartholomew Estate Winery. Mattson was\nout on $4 million bail\nwith pending federal charges at the time of the crash.\nThe embattled developer walked away with \u201cvirtually no injuries,\u201d according to California Highway Patrol. Still, he was airlifted by helicopter to the Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital regional trauma center to be evaluated.\nCalifornia Highway Patrol spokesperson Marc Renspurger said the report on the accident hadn\u2019t been completed yet and wasn\u2019t able to offer further details such as the suspected speed or whether any drunk driving tests were conducted at the scene.\n\nMattson\u2019s gated Castle Rock home was raided by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents last year. Mattson stands accused by his former business partner Timothy LeFever of siphoning money out of their business accounts into his own personal ones. Investors have accused the developer of taking their money, saying the life savings they invested with him are seemingly gone.\nIn May, federal authorities arrested Mattson and accused him of participating in \u201ca classic Ponzi scheme\u201d to steal tens of millions of dollars from hundreds of retirees and others who trusted him to invest their life savings, according to the Chronicle. Mattson pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges that month, including wire fraud and money laundering. He continues to maintain his innocence.\nAt their peak, Mattson and LeFever had amassed a portfolio of properties across Sonoma County worth more than $146 million, which included historic homes and businesses in California\u2019s wine country. They also held properties in the Sacramento area and Southern California with an estimated value of about $413 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Plans to redevelop Miami Marine Stadium were derailed by an indictment brought against the former CEO of the company tapped to oversee the restoration.\nThe City of Miami was set to vote Friday, Sept. 5 to send a referendum on the proposal to the November election, the\nMiami Herald\nreported. The city had chosen the firm Global Spectrum, doing business as Oak View Group (OVG)\u00a0 to take the reins as the operator of the historic venue.\nIn July, the Department of Justice indicted OVG\u2019s co-founder and CEO Timothy Leiweke, alleging he had conspired to rig the bidding process for \u201cthe development, management and use of a multi-purpose arena,\u201d planned for a public university campus in Austin, Texas, according to a\npress release\n. He stepped down as CEO of the firm and pleaded not guilty to the charges. OVG reached a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ and agreed to pay $15 million in penalties in July,\nBillboard\nreported.\nThat month a spokesperson for Leiweke offered this statement to\nVariety\n:\n\u201cMr. Leiweke has done nothing wrong and will vigorously defend himself and his well-deserved reputation for fairness and integrity,\u201d the spokesperson told the outlet. \u201cThe Antitrust Division\u2019s allegations are wrong on the law and the facts, and the case should never have been brought. The law is clear: vertical, complementary business partnerships, like the one contemplated between OVG and Legends, are legal. These allegations blatantly ignore established legal precedent and seek to criminalize common teaming efforts that are proven to enhance competition and benefit the public. The Moody Center is a perfect example, as it has resulted in substantial and sustained benefits to the University of Texas and the City of Austin.\u201d\nCity Manager Art Noriega told the Herald he did not learn of the indictment until Sept. 4, the night before the scheduled vote, when the outlet emailed him a request for comment. An internal memo reviewed by the outlet showed the city met with OVG four times between the indictment and the scheduled vote.\n\nThe memo read: \u201cDue diligence was conducted, including verifying corporate status,\u201d the outlet reported. \u201cThere were no adverse findings related to [the company\u2019s] responsibility.\u201d\nNoriega told the outlet the city needed to do more due diligence regarding the\nMarine Stadium\noperator selection.\n\u201cIt was other stuff beyond the indictment that was a little more concerning,\u201d Noriega told the outlet. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m not comfortable with the set of circumstances with the vendor and the continued role of the former CEO.\u201d\nWhile the OVG indictment has disrupted the plans, Noriega said the project is not dead in the water.\n\u201cWe are 100 percent committed to still moving forward with the stadium renovation, and hopefully we\u2019ll have an operational partner, whether it\u2019s this particular group or another group,\u201d he told the outlet.\n\u2013\u2013\nKate Hinsche",

        "content": "A beloved Malibu institution has been blocked from rebuilding after January\u2019s deadly Palisades fire.\nThe Reel Inn, an iconic seafood shack on Pacific Coast Highway that stood for nearly four decades, is forbidden from renewing its lease with the California Department of Parks and Recreation, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n.\nThe parks department acquired the parcel of then-private land where the restaurant was located in the early 2000s as part of an expansion of Topanga State Park,\naccording\nto Time Out Los Angeles. Reel Inn owners Teddy Seraphine-Leonard and Andy Leonard had been leasing the land from the state ever since.\nThat lease expired a month after the fires. Last month, the parks department notified them that their lease would not be renewed.\nThe owners don\u2019t want to give up, though it would be a difficult path to reopening in a smaller capacity. The Reel Inn could compete for a two- to three-year lease on the site to operate a food truck, but rebuilding any sort of permanent structure is off-limits,\nper\nthe Santa Monica Mirror.\n\u201cWould we like to revive it? Yes, we would,\u201d Seraphine-Leonard told WSJ. \u201cIt would be a Herculean task to bring it back.\u201d\n\nBecause the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has set up a staging ground on the site as part of its effort to restore the neighborhood\u2019s power grid, the Parks Department is requiring a competitive bidding process for any businesses interested in signing a short-term lease on the land.\nThough most of The Reel Inn\u2019s 18 former kitchen workers have found new jobs, the Leonards were able to assist them financially via a GoFundMe campaign that has raised more than $200,000 for the staff.\nThe couple has been offered to join other restaurants or open a new Reel Inn location in Marina del Rey. But they aren\u2019t interested and have turned down the offers. For now they\u2019re focusing on other business ventures \u2014 namely, working with two of the restaurant\u2019s former chefs on a cookbook and bottling the Reel Inn\u2019s chipotle sauce.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not the same,\u201d Seraphine-Leonard said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if this will be retirement.\u201d\nIt remains to be seen what sprouts up on the site in both the short and long term. The city of Malibu\nissued its first rebuild permit\nlast month.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The sign, which was dated Sept. 1, says the owners can get a new key when the debt is settled.\nBefore terminating the lease and locking the doors, the landlord notified the restaurant of its lease violations Aug. 21.\nMidtown Scouts Square Property also filed a lawsuit against Harden and the hospitality group, claiming at least $1 million in damages. In the lawsuit, the landlord claims the lease ended in July and both parties agreed to extend it through October.

The couple bought the four-bedroom, 4,800-square-foot spread in 2022 for a little more than $5.7 million \u2014 or about $1,188 per square foot \u2014 setting their ask about 20 percent higher than what they paid three years ago.\nSuch appreciation would be a\nfar cry from the broader market\n. Condo values in Streeterville have been mostly flat over the same stretch \u2014 up about 2 percent, according to Redfin, while Zillow data shows a 5 percent dip. Downtown condo sellers have been facing an uphill battle since the pandemic, as demand trails supply and many units sit on the market longer.\nFor high-end sellers like the Lucianos, the bet is that luxury buyers remain insulated from broader market weakness. But their pricing also tests just how much appetite remains for trophy condos in a downtown market still trying to regain its footing.\nStill, Luciano\u2019s listing leans on finishes fit for a CEO. The condo features 11-foot Venetian plaster ceilings, herringbone wood floors, horsehair wall coverings, cashmere blackout drapes in the primary bedroom and a bronze fireplace mantel. Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Brant Booker has the listing.\nLast year a Streeterville\npenthouse\nlisted for $4 million at 415 East North Water Street, and a whole lot less by the foot, asking $430 per square foot. The latest listing for that unit came down from a nearly $13 million ask when the sellers first put it on the market in 2015.\n\nLuciano, who joined ADM in 2011 and took the reins as CEO in 2015, bought the Bennett Park unit about a year before he and his wife picked up another in the same tower 15 stories below, paying $1.85 million. That second unit hit the rental market last year at $10,500 a month, but isn\u2019t listed for sale.\nADM, one of the world\u2019s largest food processors, moved its global headquarters to Chicago in 2014. Luciano has overseen the company\u2019s expansion and transition from its downstate Decatur base.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Bobby Cayre and Ben Ashkenazy are locked in on the\nMagnificent Mile\nafter paying down a big chunk of debt to their lender.\nA joint venture of the New York-based real estate titans is keeping one of Chicago\u2019s most recognizable retail spots at\n700 North Michigan Avenue\n, known as the Chicago Place Mall. To do so, the venture had to cough up $65 million to lender Aareal Capital Corporation, property records show.\nAs part of the loan paydown, Aareal extended a new $33 million senior mortgage loan against the 300,000-square-foot property, which currently houses Saks Fifth Avenue and Zara in its two ground-floor corner spaces. There is a vacancy in the spot between those stores, and T-Mobile vacated 11,000 square feet in 2023. Ashkenazy has previously toyed with the idea of turning the upper floors of vacant former shopping space into offices.\nAareal in 2021 extended the loan term for the borrowers after they paid down $6.7 million of principal on a $105 million loan originally issued in 2016. After Aareal agreed to allow the borrowers more time to pay off the $33 million in new debt, an entity linked to Cayre\u2019s firm Aurora Capital Associates at 1407 Broadway in New York provided a $65 million junior loan to the property with a maturity date of 2040.\nHow the landlords sourced the junior loan is unclear.\nBut together, the sum could amount to payoff for most of the Aareal debt, signalling Cayre\u2019s and Ashkenazy\u2019s confidence in the Magnificent Mile, despite its struggles in recent years.\n\nAareal and Cayre\u2019s firm declined to comment, while Ashkenazy Acquisition didn\u2019t return requests for comment. It\u2019s unclear whether the owners altered the portion of the property each of them owns as part of the transaction.\nHowever, the new financing staves off near-term distress at a time when Mag Mile landlords are struggling with vacancies, falling rents and shaky lender confidence.\nOther major properties, including\nWater Tower Place\n, have faced foreclosure threats or forced sales after tenants walked. By locking in new debt, the pair avoid the fate of some peers who\u2019ve handed back keys.\nCayre has been involved with the property since 2004, when it was purchased for $39 million, and Ashkenazy and New York investor Alex Adjmi were also investors. It\u2019s unclear from property records whether Adjmi is still a part of the ownership.\nStill, the fundamentals remain murky. Leasing momentum is slow, and while the city has floated ideas to revive the avenue \u2014 from entertainment-driven tenants to more residential conversions \u2014 the road back to pre-pandemic vitality may be long, and even if Cayre and Ashkenazy\u2019s fresh capital buys time, there\u2019s a question of whether it will be enough.\n",

        "content": "In the eleventh hour, the fate of three ballot proposals that take aim at the city\u2019s land use review process is in jeopardy.\nOn Tuesday, the city\u2019s Board of Elections will consider\nfive questions\napproved by the Charter Revision Commission. Typically, this part of the process would be a mere formality, a stamp before the questions are posed to voters in November.\nBut City Council leaders\nchallenged\nthree of the questions, alleging that they threaten to mislead voters. The questions ask whether various changes should be made to the city\u2019s land use review process, largely related to speeding up approvals for housing projects and restricting the informal veto power local City Council members wield over rezonings.\nBut whether the Board of Elections has the power to make such drastic changes to the upcoming ballot depends on who you ask.\nExecutive Director Michael Ryan told\nThe Real Deal\nthat the Board of Elections\u2019 legal team was reviewing whether the board has the authority to reject these questions. The board will discuss the issue on Tuesday, just two days before the deadline to finalize the ballot.\nDuring a meeting on Tuesday, President Frederic Umane\ncast doubt\non the board\u2019s ability to halt the proposals, noting the board\u2019s \u201cministerial role.\u201d\nWhat falls under \u201cministerial\u201d is apparently up for debate.\nThe City Council pointed to a 1994 decision by an appellate court that upheld an Erie County Board of Elections\u2019 rejection of a ballot question. In a response letter, Charter Revision Commission Executive Director Alec Schierenbeck cited the same case, but specified that the rejection was upheld because the proper protocol for certifying ballot questions hadn\u2019t been followed. It is within the \u201cstrictly ministerial\u201d purview of the board to reject a question in that scenario, but the wording of a ballot question should be left to the courts, the letter states.\nWhen asked about the issue, Jerry Goldfelder, an election law attorney with Cozen O\u2019Connor, also cited the appellate court decision and the fact that it \u201crecognized a board\u2019s authority to approve or reject a ballot proposal.\u201d\n\u201cIt remains to be seen what the board, or ultimately a court, would do here,\u201d he told\nTRD\nin an email.\n\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s meeting, Commissioner Frank Seddio argued that a ballot proposal could be challenged if unclear or misleading.\n\u201cAt best, in my reading, it is ambiguous, at worst it\u2019s misleading,\u201d he said, emphasizing the far-reaching implications of the ballot proposals. Seddio, a former Kings County Democrats boss, was appointed to the board in December by the City Council\u2019s Democratic caucus. A number of progressive Council members opposed the choice, the City\nreported\nat the time.\nSchierenbeck\u2019s letter counters that the ballot questions strictly follow state election law, adhering to its word count limits and clearly spelling out how a \u201cyes\u201d versus a \u201cno\u201d vote would shift authority over certain land use decisions.\nAs of Friday afternoon, board officials would only say that the issue was still under consideration and would be addressed during Tuesday\u2019s meeting. Whether the board rejects or approves the questions, the body\u2019s actions next week are likely to result in legal action. The City Council has already indicated that it is prepared to sue to block the proposals from being placed on the ballot. The Charter Revision Commission emphasized in its letter that the courts should decide, not the Board of Elections.\nOne of the questions the Council wants eliminated asks whether the city should replace the mayoral veto in the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, or Ulurp, with a three-member appeals board for certain projects. The board could only reverse Council decisions on projects that would result in affordable housing in one borough, not citywide land use actions.\nAnother asks voters if modest housing projects should go through a quicker review process that bypasses City Council approval. The third proposal would fast-track housing (avoiding a Council vote) in districts that have approved the lowest rates of affordable housing.\nThe City Council\u2019s attempts to eliminate these questions \u2014 and the uncertainty over how the board will act \u2014 have drawn the ire of real estate and housing groups.\n\u201cWe are at a crossroads,\u201d New York Apartment Association\u2019s Kenny Burgos said in a statement. \u201cDo we let the supporters and opponents of these proposals make their case to the voters and let voters decide, or do we revert to back room deals and cronyism that leave voters powerless in the decisions about their future?\u201d\nPro-housing group Open New York blamed Republicans on the Board of Elections for trying to \u201cshortcut the democratic process.\u201d\n\u201cThere seems to be no limit to the corruption, prejudice, and small-mindedness that will drive political pawns who are not policymakers to undemocratically halt progress in its tracks,\u201d Annemarie Gray, the group\u2019s executive director, said in a statement. \u201cThe BOE should stay in its own lane and let New Yorkers drive the bus towards their own future by allowing them to vote on these measures, which we are confident will pass overwhelmingly.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Two builder\u2019s remedy projects in Beverly Hills that drew criticism from residents are getting even bigger.\nThe developments at 125-129 South Linden Drive and 8844 Burton Way are adding several stories to their project plans, the\nBeverly Press\nreported\n.\nLeo Pustilnikov, the developer who\nsuccessfully sued the city of Beverly Hills\nfor\nunlawfully blocking\nthe Linden project from advancing, has updated plans for that development to nearly double the size.\nWith the new Linden proposal, the tower grows from 19 to 36 stories and from approximately 200 feet to 400 feet. It now includes an additional 185 units with 28 set aside for affordable housing for a total of 350 units, 61 reserved for low-income residents. An 80-room luxury hotel is also slated for the property.\n\u201cThis project represents a bold vision for the future of Beverly Hills,\u201d Pustilnikov said in a statement of the Linden development. However, Michael Forbes, Beverly HIlls\u2019 director of community development, said the city has not yet received an application for the revised application.\nThe size of the Linden Drive tower, even at its original height, drew the ire of the Southwest Beverly Hills Homeowners Association. Association president Ken Goldman was disappointed with Pustilnikov\u2019s new plans.\n\u201cIn my opinion, the greedy developer just got greedier,\u201d Goldman told the Beverly Press. \u201cIf he really wants to help the housing situation, then 100 percent of his project should be available for affordable housing.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile,\nCrescent Heights\u2019 planned builder\u2019s remedy project\nat 8844 Burton Way, currently an empty lot, increased from 20 to 26 stories, according to revised plans submitted to the city.\nThe Burton Way tower would rise approximately 309 feet, up from the previous height of 223 feet, and increase from 480,686 square feet to 492,029 square feet. It would also include 318 parking spaces instead of the previously proposed 277, though it will keep the same number of housing units at 200.\nThe updated project still includes affordable housing units, though the number was slashed from 40 lower-income units to 14 extremely-low-income units and eight moderate-income units. The move was made after changes to California housing laws reduced the number of affordable housing units required to qualify for builder\u2019s remedy status.\nExtremely-low-income in Los Angeles County is\nconsidered\nto be a maximum annual wage of $31,850 for one person, while moderate-income is a maximum of $89,550.\n\u201cAs residents, we are not opposed to thoughtful, balanced development. We care deeply about responsible growth that honors the unique character of Beverly Hills,\u201d local resident Ren\u00e9e Strauss told the Press. \u201cBut when city leadership fails to communicate after specifically committing to do better, it erodes trust and creates unnecessary division. We are simply asking that the city uphold its promise, protect our voice and ensure transparency in matters that affect us all.\u201d\nUnder its\nHousing Element\n, the city of Beverly Hills must plan to build 3,104 new housing units by 2029.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "After six years of trying to find a buyer, the sprawling Green Gables estate in Woodside has finally sold \u2014 setting a record for the Bay Area in the process.\nA sale of lots tied to the estate closed on Wednesday for approximately $85 million, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. It\u2019s a sharp drop from the 2019 list price of $117 million and\n2021 price of $135 million\n, though it still marks the priciest sale in the Bay Area so far this year.\nThe storied Woodside compound has long been tied to the Fleishhacker family, built in the early 20th century by Anglo California Bank and Great Western Power Company founder Mortimer Fleishhacker. A group of Fleishhacker\u2019s family members opted to sell to prevent infighting over the estate. The off-market purchase was made by New York-based Pantheum LLC,\nincorporated\nin August 2023, according to the Business Times.\nIt might have traded hands for 30 percent less than its\nrecent $125 million asking price\nbut still far outdoes last year\u2019s most expensive home sale in the Bay Area. That deal involved the $71 million sale of 2840 Broadway in San Francisco\u2019s ritzy Pacific Heights neighborhood by Laurene Powell Jobs, widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.\nStill, the Green Gables sale doesn\u2019t come close to teaching the Bay Area\u2019s most expensive home sale in history. That title belongs to a 2012 off-market deal where SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son bought a 9-acre estate in Woodside at 360 Mountain Home Road for $117.5 million, per the Business Times.\n\nThe first home on Green Gables built for the Fleishhackers was a nearly 10,000-square-foot home calling to mind English thatch-roofed cottages. Over the subsequent decades, six other homes were built on the property. All seven residences are private and separated from each other.\nThe property features a Roman pool, a stone teahouse, three swimming pools, a fruit and vegetable garden, a tennis court and an artist\u2019s studio used by family matriarch Bella Gerstle Fleishhacker.\nIrrigation for 90 percent of the estate\u2019s gardens is fed via a 50,000-square-foot, 20-foot-deep reservoir. The property also has the rights to the nearby Kings Mountain watershed, including an easement and deed to use up to 30 million gallons of water per year.\nOver the years, the estate has welcomed diplomats, politicians and business leaders, including hosting the 20th anniversary celebration for the United Nations in 1965. It was also where former Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes stayed during her infamous Bay Area trial in 2021.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The saga began in 2020 when ASA missed rent payments, leading JEMB to sue the school and its owner, Alex Shchegol.\nBut the lawsuit was one of many controversies dogging Shchegol and the for-profit college industry. Shchegol made life hard for the college\u2019s old landlord, embarking on a series of unusual legal maneuvers, leading to accusations from JEMB\u2019s lawyers that said his legal strategy amounted to judgment evasion.\nWith the litigation all settled, JEMB may finally collect from ASA; a New York state court awarded two judgments over $18 million against Shchegol and ASA in 2022.\nASA\u2019s space at 1293 Broadway has since been taken by Yeshiva University.\nThat legal saga wasn\u2019t the education system\u2019s only grip on real estate this week.\nThe Upper West Side property that held the shuttered Manhattan Country School, a progressive private institution, is\nup for sale\n. Manhattan Country School purchased the building from The New School, which housed its music college at the site.\nThe building at 150 West 85th Street was appraised at $39 million in 2021, but it\u2019s unclear what Bob Knakal will be able to arrange in an acquisition.\nThe school\u2019s expansion plans, funded by draining its endowment and borrowing $20 million, were hindered by the pandemic and may have ultimately led to its collapse and bankruptcy.\n\nQueens-based Flushing Bank held the debt. Last October, it filed for foreclosure on the building. A bankruptcy filing for the school came months later.\nGlow up\nElsewhere, Sephora\nleased a 7,800-square-foot retail space\nat 1 St. Mark\u2019s Place, a boutique office project in the East Village developed by the late Brandon Miller\u2019s company, Real Estate Equities Corporation.\nThe project has seen its fair share of challenges, including a foreclosure attempt in 2021 before construction began and REEC falling behind on loan payments in the middle of last year.\nDespite past difficulties and a shift in REEC\u2019s focus to office development before the pandemic, the completion of the building and this lease indicate a positive step forward for the project.\nLagging\nNew development contracts in NYC\nfell 9 percent in August\n, but dollar volume jumped by 13 percent to $597 million, largely on the back of an $87.5 million penthouse deal at 140 Jane Street.\nA major factor contributing to the seemingly slow month was 80 Clarkson Street, a 112-unit development, which has yet to report any contracts despite reported strong sales activity.\nOther factors weighing on the market include a lack of new inventory, buyers anticipating lower mortgage rates and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming mayoral race.\n",

We\u2019re moving to Miami.\u201d\nThe social media ad\nechoes warnings\nfrom other luxury agents who have been warning of an exodus of the city\u2019s wealthy residents since Mamdani prevailed in the Democratic primary earlier this summer.\n\u201cMy number one job will be moving people from New York to Florida. Again,\u201d Serhant told the New York Post shortly after the vote. \u201cBased on the results, clients are going to hold off on making any kind of investment in New York City.\u201d\nWhether a Mamdani triumph will send New Yorkers who aren\u2019t already spending six months and a day down South packing is still up for debate, but it\u2019s clear that real estate is jittery over the prospect.\nThe industry\u2019s support has\nvacillated between\nformer Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams, with its power players throwing their weight behind both candidates, according to the latest round of campaign donations.\nBut as rumor has it, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has been mulling over potential positions for Adams and the Republican mayoral candidate, Curtis Sliwa, in an attempt to consolidate opposition to Mamdani and give the challenger, likely Cuomo, a stronger shot at beating him in the general election.\nThe latest reports, which circulated on Friday, indicated the president\u2019s advisers, including developer Steve Witkoff, were in talks to offer Adams an ambassadorship in Saudi Arabia.\nAdams has denied that he\u2019d had any discussions with the administration, though he appeared to soften his position in a statement released on Friday and published in the New York Times.\nIn the statement, Adams said that \u201cno formal offers have been made\u201d and that he is \u201cstill running for re-election.\u201d\n\nBut if the rumors prove true, Goldentayer may have to rethink the billboard.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: The number of millionaire renters in the United States nearly tripled between 2019 and 2023, outpacing the increase in the number of millionaire homeowners, according to data from\nRentCafe\n.\nNew York City led the charge with roughly 5,600 millionaire households leasing homes in the city \u2014 but where are they renting?

Elana Leopold, a political strategist, will serve as a senior adviser for the Democratic nominee\u2019s campaign, while Louise Yeung, who worked previously under de Blasio\u2019s Department of Transportation and as chief climate officer for comptroller Brad Lander, will serve as policy director.\n\u2014 Here\u2019s a new form of protest: A town Council candidate in Cranford, New Jersey, started break dancing at a town hall meeting to push back against property tax increases, according to\nABC6 Action News\n. The candidate, Will Thilly, took a brief pause to raise questions about the tax changes, only to resume his moves, including an attempt at a backspin.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$4.1 million\nfor 140 East 63rd Street, 13/14D.

        "content": "Compass is selling five North Shore offices to RE/MAX Premier, giving the RE/MAX brokerage\u00a0 a foothold in suburban Chicago\u2019s luxury market.\nRE/MAX Premier is acquiring Compass offices in Glencoe, Glenview, Highland Park, Lake Forest and\nWinnetka\n, the brokerage announced this week. The lakeshore towns sport multimillion dollar mansions and boast some of the highest prices around Chicago. Winnetka, for example, was the site of the\nmost expensive home sale\nin Chicagoland\u2019s history this week, when an offer of more than $31 million closed for 419 Sheridan Road.\nThe sale of the Compass offices comes less than a year after\nCompass acquired @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate\n, making the combined business by far the largest brokerage in the Chicago area. @properties has offices in each city where RE/MAX Premier is rebranding Compass offices.\nFounded in 2011 by CEO Janice Corley, RE/MAX Premier currently has five offices between Chicago and Houston, Texas. The new acquisition will double its office space and give it exposure to the high-end real estate that makes up the North Shore.\nAs the buildings change hands, it remains to be seen what will become of the more than 200 agents that work at the five Compass offices. As independent contractors, agents generally have freedom to move brokerages within their contracts\u2019 terms.\nTamara Edwards, Corley\u2019s spokesperson, said the agents at the offices aren\u2019t required to move to RE/MAX Premier as part of the deal and it hasn\u2019t been determined how many will join the brokerage once it sets up shop in the offices. Several Compass agents at the offices reached by phone declined to comment on the deal.\n\u201cThey can stay at the brand that they would like, and if they\u2019d like to come over to RE/MAX, that\u2019s obviously an option,\u201d Edwards said.\nEdwards said Corley wants to hire 500 agents to staff the brokerage\u2019s new North Shore operations going forward.\n\nRE/MAX and Compass did not share the financial details of the deal.\nFor Compass, the decision to shed the offices was part of an effort to cut down on its brick-and-mortar presence in the North Shore after its purchase of @properties, a Compass source told\nThe Real Deal.\nThe person said Compass will continue to serve North Shore clients through its nearby offices.\nCorley pitched the purchase as bringing control of the offices from a national firm to local ownership. RE/MAX operates under a franchise model, in which brokerages like RE/MAX Premier are owned and operated independently.\nThe RE/MAX business model gives agents more autonomy and is an alternative to \u201cmany real estate companies today that are owned by venture capital or hedge funds with no local presence,\u201d Corley said.\nHer push into the North Shore comes as Chicago-area residential brokerages increasingly consolidate to scale up their reach, with an eye on maximizing their luxury clientele. Following the Compass purchase of @properties, Baird &amp; Warner responded by acquiring Dream Town Real Estate in Chicago.\nThe former Compass offices will be part of The RE/MAX Collection, RE/MAX\u2019s luxury division. They will begin transitioning to the RE/MAX brand over the next month.\nCompass has made an aggressive push to increase its market share in Chicago, and nationally, in the last few years through acquisitions of major brokerages and teams. When it purchased @properties last year, co-CEOs Thad Wong and Mike Golden said the two brokerages would continue to operate as separate business units with separate branding.\nCompass\nreported all-time records\nacross 10 metrics in its second-quarter earnings call this year, including net income, revenue and market share. It brought in more than $2 billion in revenue and grew its national market share to 6.09 percent.\n",

        "content": "One of Chicago\u2019s fastest-growing law firms is cutting back on square footage even as it levels up its address, falling into the trend of office tenants downsizing their leases while moving into newer buildings.\nKilpatrick Townsend &amp; Stockton inked a deal for just over 29,000 square feet on the 45th floor of BMO Tower at 320 South Canal Street, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The Atlanta-based firm will move in October 2026, consolidating two separate Chicago offices totaling more than 70,000 square feet into the new space.\nThat downsizing means more pain for downtown landlords already battling record vacancies. Kilpatrick is set to exit about 34,000 square feet at 175 West Jackson Boulevard, a property heading toward foreclosure, and another 37,000 square feet at 500 West Madison Street, an asset owned by KBS Realty Advisors that\u2019s nearly 90 percent leased.\nThe consolidation is a win for the BMO-anchored tower, a 52-story, 1.5 million-square-foot development by Riverside Investment &amp; Development and Convexity Properties completed mid-pandemic. The building was 78 percent leased before the deal, with law firms proving to be a reliable tenant base, the outlet reported. Faegre Drinker, Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom, and Chapman &amp; Cutler already call the tower home.\nOther firms, such as\nAntares\nCapital and\nMolson Coors\n, relocated to the BMO tower in recent years.\n\nKilpatrick has been on a Chicago growth tear, acquiring L&amp;G Law Group in 2023 and HMB Legal Counsel last year, adding more than 55 attorneys. It now has close to 100 lawyers and staff in the city.\nIts departure from 175 West Jackson is especially\nbruising\nfor its landlord and lender. The 1.4 million-square-foot building, owned by Brookfield Asset Management, has been mired in foreclosure since 2022 after the landlord defaulted on a $280 million loan. The property was appraised at just $84 million last fall, down from $210 million in 2022, and was less than half leased as of May. Another major tenant, Wolverine Trading, is also leaving.\nCushman &amp; Wakefield brokers Steve Schneider, Chris Wood and Presley Norby represented Kilpatrick during lease negotiations.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February in the face of mounting liens and a loan default.\nContractors and suppliers have\nfiled about $8 million in liens\non the property, prompting the lender Austin-based WM Capital Partners, which provided a $14.4 million loan, to ask the judge to take the property out of the owner\u2019s hands. The deal allows Blueprint principals to retain an indirect ownership stake and settles the claims regarding the property.

        "content": "Texas multifamily has been\nfalling from grace since the end of 2023\n, but experts say it\u2019s still just the beginning.\nAt a Connect CRE conference on Texas multifamily, speakers on a panel about distress\nanticipated a mounting wave\n, as $19 billion in CMBS loans tied to Texas multifamily is set to mature in the next five years.\nCWCapital\u2019s James Shevlin kept it succinct: \u201cIt\u2019s trouble.\u201d\nAs the foreclosure auction block grows increasingly crowded each month, it would appear that trouble\u2019s already here. This month, more than\n$700 million\nin CRE loans in Texas\u2019 largest counties were flagged for foreclosure. That\u2019s up from about $400 million in July.\nMost of the properties in question are older apartment complexes with loans from 2022. The prevailing narrative is that upstart multifamily operators amassed portfolios with floating-rate loans when debt was cheap. They planned to renovate these aging properties, jack up rents and sell the apartments at a premium. But, interest rates \u2014 and their debt service \u2014 ballooned before many of them could execute.\nMonth after month, Harris County, home to Houston, is hardest hit. At the September sale, 10 properties totaling nearly $350 million in debt faced foreclosure. The number includes a few holdovers from last month when multifamily operator Fercan Kalkan had\n3,000 units targeted for default\n.\n\nThe latest Beige Book from the Dallas Federal Reserve faintly echoes these woes with a \u201ccautious\u201d outlook for commercial real estate in the area, noting \u201cscattered reports of distressed property sales.\u201d Construction and investment sales are sluggish, it reported.\nHere\u2019s more Texas real estate news from this week:\nOn CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box, Federal Housing Financing Agency boss\nBill Pulte refused to comment\non mortgage fraud accusations involving Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. In the same segment, he discussed similar accusations involving Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The accusations provided the basis for Cook\u2019s ouster by Trump, who\u2019s also been exerting his populist political style and appeal in attempts to convince Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates.\nHouston-based master-planned community developer Land Tejas announced\nco-founder and CEO Al Brende died\nat the age of 80. Since Brende helped found the company in 1997, it\u2019s developed 15,000 acres of land and more than 20 communities in Houston, including Sunterra, which is consistently ranked among the top-selling master-planned communities nationwide. In 2024, it came in fourth.\nThe\ntop single-family sale\nin what\u2019s become a buyers market in Austin was a 3,400-square-foot new build in Zilker. The five-bed, four-bath at 1001 Bluebonnet Land was asking $3.4 million. It was listed on May 8 for $3.25 million, removed from the MLS on Aug. 14, and relisted the next day asking $150,000 more.

        "content": "Former Pacific Union and Compass California boss\nMark McLaughlin\nhas retired, kind of.\n\u201cI turned 66 [on Tuesday] and I think it\u2019s my turn to enjoy my life with Monique, my wife,\u201d McLaughlin said as he described his new part-time advisory role with Compass earlier this week.\nAfter his two-year contract as chief real estate strategist ended this summer, McLaughlin\u2019s now settled into semi-retirement, if you can call it that.\nAside from his role at Compass, he\u2019s an advisor in Homeowner.ai and mortgage lender Realfinity through past investments made via his venture fund, McLaughlin Ventures. Taking on additional clients in the brokerage business is not likely, he said, pointing to a conflict of interest given his insights into Compass.\nThe executive was Compass California president between September 2018 and December 2020. Before that, McLaughlin grew Pacific Union International through a dozen acquisitions when he stepped into the CEO role in 2009. When Compass bought Pacific Union, McLaughlin had grown the brokerage to $14 billion in annual sales volume.\nAnatomy of a brokerage deal\nAll that said, McLaughlin\u2019s not stepping away from the M&amp;A world entirely. In fact, before he hung up the phone with\nThe Real Deal\n, he offered his final comment: \u201cMake my phone ring.\u201d\nThat was after plenty of shop talk around the current state of play for brokerage M&amp;A.\nMcLaughlin expects continued industry consolidation, acknowledging that, while this may not look like a good time to sell, earnouts and other clauses baked into a contract could make a trade more palatable to sellers.\nWhile brokerages generally trade at a multiple of 3 to 5.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, McLaughlin said conversations around EBITDA are more nuanced now. That\u2019s in part due to non-recurring expenses, such as legal fees or last year\u2019s National Association of Realtors-related commission settlement that can distort EBITDA, a metric that offers a clear line of sight into a business\u2019s cash flow, ability to pay down debt or valuation.\n\u201cThe thing you have to keep in context is four years ago, five years ago, the negotiation between buyer and seller was, \u2018What\u2019s my multiple of EBITDA going to be?\u2019 Now, it\u2019s \u2018How many adjustments can I make to my EBITDA so we can work out a deal,\u2019\u201d McLaughlin said.\nAdditionally, whether or not a brokerage is more desirable to prospective buyers because of diversified revenue streams from services such as title or escrow, depends on the market it operates in. If a market is already saturated with those ancillary services, a plain vanilla brokerage deal could work, he offered.\nCompass makes another Colorado buy\nOne name that\u2019s making things work on the M&amp;A front: Compass.\n\nThe brokerage said Thursday it snapped up Littleton, Colo.-based Colorado Home Realty, which counted $617.2 million in 2024 sales volume under co-founder and CEO Matt Hudson.\nThe brokerage joins Compass\u2019 existing footprint in the state with nearly 20 offices in Aspen, Boulder, Denver and Vail among other locations.\nColorado Home Realty\u2019s acquisition follows Compass\u2019 purchase in early July of PorchLight Real Estate Group, also based in Colorado. PorchLight had sales volume last year of $922.3 million.\nLater in July, Compass bought Cottingham Chalk in North Carolina, with $589 million in 2024 volume.\nLA\u2019s largest brokerages\nSpeaking of sales volume,\nTRD\u2019s ranking\nof Los Angeles\u2019 largest brokerages was published in our September issue and elicited strong reactions as they always do.\nOn the actual substance of the rankings, the top three firms remained unchanged with Compass leading the pack by a wide margin with $14.5 billion in sales across 5,966 on-market deals for the July 1, 2024 to July 1, 2025 reporting period. Coldwell Banker Realty came in at No. 2 with $5.4 billion in volume and 2,289 deals. Meanwhile, The Agency closed on $3.6 billion across 1,147 deals to round out the top three.\nInterestingly, Carolwood Estates shot up four spaces on the list to No. 4 with 478 on-market deals, tallying to $3.3 billion in volume. It\u2019s an impressive feat for a brokerage that launched in November 2022.\nUp next is the agents and teams ranking for Los Angeles in our October issue.\nPalisades resi bests itself, again\nIf anyone\u2019s keeping tabs on Carolwood, it only took a week for the firm\u2019s name to resurface in another\nTRD\nheadline.\nThe brokerage was involved with the $25.8 million sale of\n1124 Napoli Drive\n, which was dropped in the MLS for comp purposes but traded off market. Napoli Drive now sits as the Palisades\u2019 most expensive residential purchase this year.\nCarolwood\u2019s Zac Mostame and the Beverly Hills Estates Lea Porter together represented both the buyer and seller in that trade.\nNapoli Drive beat the Los Angeles community\u2019s previous record sale in the $22.1 million purchase of the Parry Residence at\n14924 Camarosa Drive\n. That property held the title of priciest Palisades deal for about a week.\n",

        "content": "More wealthy would-be buyers are doing the math, and deciding their deals for a piece of New York City real estate aren\u2019t adding up.\nMore of the city\u2019s wealthiest residents are opting to rent, according to data from UrbanDigs released earlier this summer. Between January and April, 300 ultra-luxury rentals \u2014 defined as homes asking more than $20,000 a month \u2014 were rented, a 30 percent uptick compared to the same period last year.\nUrbanDigs\u2019 findings are proof of a trend that\u2019s been building since at least 2019, according to a\nreport from RentCafe\n. The report found the number of millionaire renters tripled across the country between 2019 and 2023, with the highest number of millionaire renters living in New York City. With more than 5,600 millionaire renter households, the city far surpassed the runner-up, San Francisco, with just 1,400.\nAn increase in wealthy renters is likely a good sign for developers like Orin Wilf, whose firm,\u00a0 Skyline Developers, is launching a luxury rental project at 18 West 55th Street, where asking rents will top out around $35,000 a month.\nWilf said the team envisioned building luxury condos during the initial planning phase almost eight years ago, but during the pandemic, they shifted to luxury rentals instead.\n\u201cThe real explanation is simple,\u201d Wilf said. \u201cRents have increased. Instead of selling, let\u2019s rent them and rent them for pretty good numbers, but still under the cost of buying something across the street on Billionaires\u2019 Row.\u201d\nAnd, according to his estimation, the project\u2019s units couldn\u2019t be hitting the market at a better time \u2014 wealthy buyers are hesitant to pull the trigger with the upcoming mayoral election still in flux and with mortgage rates still persistently high.\n\u201cThe rental market is the hottest it has ever been in the history of New York City,\u201d Wilf said. \u201cThere has never been a market like this one.\u201d\nThe Agency\u2019s Mike Fabbri said the \u201cuptick\u201d in demand included tenants who were displaced by the fires in Los Angeles and are now searching for short-term options, between three to six months, to test out a potential move to the city. He\u2019s also secured rentals for those renovating homes they purchased and need a place to stay while the work continues, as well as parents renting spots near their children who are working or attending school in the city.\nDowntown Manhattan has dominated the borough\u2019s luxury activity this year, with new developments drawing some away from the pricey uptown enclaves they have historically picked. But the neighborhoods south of 14th Street have been cleaning up with high-priced rental deals.\nAn executive with Michael Rubin\u2019s sports platform, Fanatics, agreed this week to pay\n$40,000 a month\nfor a condo at 160 Leroy. The deal, which works out to $234 per square foot, is a peak price for the property, which previously set the record for the building when it rented for $32,000 earlier this year.\n\nIn July, a top-floor unit at 130 William Street\nset a rental record for the Financial District\nafter an off-market deal for $75,000 per month. Corcoran\u2019s Steve Gold initially listed the unit for $20 million in 2020, and told Mansion Global the sale offer stands even after inking the one-year lease.\nNot so fast\u2026\nColdwell Banker Warburg is upping its star power.\nThe host of MTV\u2019s \u201cCatfish,\u201d N\u0113v Schulman, is now an agent at the New York City-based brokerage, the firm announced this week. Schulman, who was also the runner-up on \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d in 2020, is joining the company where his father, Robert Schulman, has been a broker for more than 30 years.\n\u201cHosting Catfish taught me how to listen deeply, build trust quickly, and help people\nnavigate some of the most emotional decisions of their lives,\u201d Schulman said. \u201cReal estate in New York is no different.\u201d\nNews of Schulman\u2019s debut at the firm comes after one of the stars of Netflix\u2019s\n\u201cSelling the City,\u201d\nAbigail Godfrey, jumped to the brokerage from Douglas Elliman, where she was a member of Eleonora Srugo\u2019s Eleonora &amp; Co. team. The series, which has only had one season, followed Srugo and her then-cohort of five agents, though none of the show\u2019s cast members appear to be still working with her, according to her team\u2019s website.\nColdwell Banker Warburg, led by Kevelyn Guzman, has been on a hiring streak in recent months, including bringing on more than two dozen agents from Elegran Real Estate, a boutique firm that recently broke from its partnership with Forbes Global Properties. One of its managers, Jared Antin, left the firm earlier this summer to join Brown Harris Stevens as an executive director.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe most expensive deal recorded in the city register this week was for a penthouse at Legion Investment Group\u2019s 109 East 79th Street, which sold for $33 million, or $5,000 per square foot. The deal for the Upper East Side condo, which\nlast asked $35 million\n, was up from its 2022 purchase price, when a company registered in Montevideo, Uruguay, bought the apartment for $28 million.\nPenthouse 16 spans 6,500 square feet and has five bedrooms and five bathrooms. It also features two terraces. The Modlin Group\u2019s Adam Modlin represented the buyer, an entity known as Pixidust LLC, and the seller.\n",

        "content": "A couple of recent trades in San Jose put the South Bay city\u2019s multifamily market in rarefied air \u2014 at least on a relative basis.\nConsider that both deals involved complexes of affordable units, one marked a new high-water mark for the year on overall price in the broader Santa Clara County market, and each of them topped $300,000 per unit.\nIndeed, the range from $317,000 for a property just north of the 280 Freeway and $390,000 for just south of the thoroughfare in West San Jose nearly touches the $400,000 or so per unit average of multifamily in neighboring San Francisco lately, and is well ahead of farther-flung\u00a0 major metros such as Chicago, where the average is closer to $200,000 per unit.\nReal estate firm Standard Communities, nonprofit Housing on Merit, and investment company Vistria Real Estate\nbought the Park Kiely apartments\nin the larger of the two deals, acquiring 355 Kiely Boulevard for $370 million. The $390,300-per-unit transaction was made possible by a purchase loan of $203.5 million from JLL Real Estate Capital, which then transferred it to Freddie Mac.\nThe transaction is the priciest in Santa Clara County so far this year,\naccording\nto the Mercury News. The previous high-water mark in the county was set in April with the sale of The Villages at Cupertino apartments to Rockpoint Group for $207.2 million.\nElsewhere in the South Bay city, San Francisco-based Sack Capital Partners and Encinitas-based Las Palmas Housing\nbought the Fountain Park apartments\nfor $52 million. The property at 1028 South De Anza Boulevard consists of 164 units, working out to $317,000 per unit.\nSan Jose has seen other multifamily properties change hands in recent months, some dipping into the Chicago range.\nLos Angeles-based real estate firm Post Glen Group and Newport Beach-based nonprofit Affordable Housing Access bought the\nOrchard Glen\napartments in south San Jose in June. Post Glen Group Affordable Housing Access bought the 288-unit property at 3975 Seven Trees Boulevard for $61.1 million, about $212,000 per unit.\nThen there are the upper-tier deals, which also seem to be coming along in San Jose.\nBack in May a Hines affiliate bought the 108-unit\nLevare\nluxury apartment complex at 3003 Olin Road in the Santana Row commercial and residential district for $73.9 million, nearing $700,000 per unit.\nThat seems to have sparked some interest\u2013last month, Santana Row owner Federal Realty Investment Trust started preparations to sell the 212-unit\nMisora\ncomplex in the development\n.\nAt long last, buyers save distressed SF hotels\nA two-year saga involving two of San Francisco\u2019s biggest hotels has come to an end.\nNew York-based Newbond Holdings and Conversant Capital are in contract to buy the beleaguered\nParc 55 and Hilton Union Square\nhotels. Hilton Union Square is the city\u2019s largest hotel with 1,921 rooms, while The Parc 55, also a Hilton property, is among the top five with 1,024 keys.\n\nThe sale price wasn\u2019t disclosed, but a July bondholder report placed the hotels\u2019 combined appraised value between $450 million and $500 million, down from their 2016 appraised value of nearly $1.6 billion. The buyers were required to put down two deposits of $10 million each.\nThe buildings fell into default in 2023 when former owner Park Hotels &amp; Resorts defaulted on its $725 million loan on the properties. A court-appointed receiver spent the next two years looking for a buyer. Sales deadlines were repeatedly pushed as\nforeclosure loomed\n.\nThe Bay Area lodging market remains strained, as several hotels in the East and South Bay enclaves have\nfallen into foreclosure\nor shuttered entirely over the past two years.\nFairfield found to be illegally taxing property owners\nThe city of Fairfield is in hot water after a court found it to be\nillegally taxing property owners\n.\nThe First District Court of Appeal in San Francisco ruled the Solano County city collected assessments for lighting, landscaping and roadway maintenance in the Rolling Hills Maintenance District in violation of a 1996 voter-approved ballot measure known as Proposition 218.\nThat law mandated public votes on any property tax increases. The assessment jumped from $196.33 in 1997 to $300 in the 2022-2023 year.

        "content": "A new high water mark was set for residential real estate in the Chicago area this week.\nA lakefront Winnetka mansion known as\nWindsor House was sold for nearly $31.3 million\nby a former Goldman Sachs executive to a buyer whose identity hasn\u2019t yet been publicly unveiled, smashing the previous priciest single-family home sale ever in Chicagoland.\nThe former record holder was the\n$15.3 million sale of a Lincoln Park mansion\nto commercial real estate developer\nDavid Cocagne and his wife Manassi\n. Its old owners,\ninsurance magnates Richard and Michaela Parrillo\n, once listed that property for $50 million.\nWhile the Winnetka home at 419 Sheridan Road went below its\n$35 million asking price\n\u2014 and well below the more than $60 million the sellers were said to spend on improvements and land assembly over their decades of ownership \u2014 the drop to its sale price wasn\u2019t nearly as extreme. The transaction shows the North Shore\u2019s high-end retains its reputation among the\nMidwest\u2019s wealthy elite\n.\nValues\nremain suppressed\n, however, in downtown Chicago\u2019s commercial property scene. The 1.5 million-square-foot\nCitadel Center office tower in the Loop at 131 South Dearborn Street\nis officially for sale. Once a corporate crown jewel, the building now enters a market without holding its namesake tenant\u2019s headquarters, which was moved to Miami. Plus,\noffice values have cratered\n, financing is scarce and investors are wary. Its listing underscores just how brutal the reset has been for Chicago\u2019s central business district, where even stabilized assets face an uphill climb.\n\nMultifamily owners have been\nnavigating turbulence of their own\n. A handful of distressed properties across the city have taken circuitous routes back to health through loan workouts, receiverships or firesales. Some have managed to stabilize with fresh capital, while others have changed hands at steep discounts \u2014 evidence of a sector recovering, but unevenly.\nAt the Chicago Housing Authority,\nMayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s appointment of longtime 27th Ward Alderman Walter Burnett Jr\n. hit a speedbump. Corporate attorney and CHA board member\nMatthew Brewer\nbecame the agency\u2019s interim chief, raising eyebrows after Brewer requested the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to review Burnett\u2019s possible conflicts of interest as the CHA\u2019s next potential head. Brewer now oversees, at least in the short-term, an agency under pressure to deliver on long-delayed affordable housing expansion promises\nOn the development front, builder\nSteven Ciaccio of Domus Group\nis in the hot seat. Facing foreclosure threats, unpaid bills and mounting lawsuits even as his firm has a 30-story Fulton Market apartment tower proposal in the works, Ciaccio is emblematic of a class of mid-tier developers squeezed hard by today\u2019s financing climate.\nPulling back isn\u2019t an option for many developers, though.\nMitch Goltz is pivoting\nwith his new firm GTZ Properties, by stepping away from risky plans for multifamily towers and doubling down on retail. It\u2019s a back-to-basics bet on steady cash flow as other asset classes wobble \u2014\u00a0while still leaving room for some bets on distressed commercial property in need of a makeover, like the\nOak Brook office complex Goltz just picked up at a big discount\nfrom its last trade.",

        "content": "Lenders are looking to\nsell\nthe debt connected to the Brookfield-owned EY Plaza after a deal to purchase the distressed downtown office tower fell apart.\nColliers peddled the $275 million non-performing loan in an offering memorandum, stressing \u201ca massive discount to note balance,\u201d while playing up what it called an iconic tower.\nThe 41-story, 900,000 square foot property at 725 South Figueroa Street was placed in receivership two years ago after a debt default. The last appraisal put its value at $150 million compared to $446 million when the note was issued.\nThat happens to be more than what the office tower would have sold for had Carolwood\u2019s deal closed; Adam Rubin and Andrew Shanfeld\u2019s private equity firm was set to pay $130 million before it fell out of contract.\nWho knows how much the debt will go for now. Downtown is still downtown: office vacancies are at about 33 percent and the return to work hasn\u2019t revived the area.\nHotel on the block\nLos Angeles hotels have also seen better days.\nThe Hyatt House hotel, located on the University of Southern California\u2019s health sciences campus, is\nheaded\nto a foreclosure auction.\nThe Mayer Corporation, developer of the five-story, 200-key hotel at 2200 East Trojan Way, landed a $61.5 million refinancing loan from Westbrook Partners four years ago that it has since defaulted on.\nEntities connected to the Mayer Corporation and Westbrook Partners were in civil litigation after the lender requested a receiver be appointed to take possession of the hotel. The \u201cborrower is in default under the loan and does not wish to continue operating the hotel,\u201d court documents read, arguing that the hotel wasn\u2019t making enough money.\nBut the plaintiff requested a dismissal and the court vacated earlier orders days before the notice of trustee\u2019s sale, and the case is now closed.\n\nBuyer wanted\nWhole Foods\u2019 Pasadena home is on the\nmarket\nfor $75.7 million. But don\u2019t worry, the luxe grocer and its cult favorite berry chantilly cake aren\u2019t going anywhere. The decade left on its lease is a selling point, that and the \u201caffluent\u201d neighborhood that surrounds it, per the listing held by Newmark.\nThe seller, an entity connected to the Kutzer Company, purchased the 77,000 square foot property six years ago for $105 million from a private family trust as part of a five-parcel, off-market deal. Before that, it sold for $43.3 million.\nIf the Whole Foods-leased property at 465 South Arroyo Parkway sells, it\u2019ll fetch more than recorded retail sales in Pasadena during the second quarter. The two priciest sales in Pasadena were the Pasadena Plaza, which sold for $42 million and the Pasadena Playhouse &amp; Lofts, which sold for $9.5 million, according to a CBRE report.\nTiffany\u2019s to Rodeo\nYou may see a robin-egg blue storefront on Rodeo in the coming years as French billionaire Bernard Arnault continues to bet on the opulent Beverly Hills corridor.\nLVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE is\nplanning\nto develop a new Tiffany &amp; Co. shop on the site of an old Luxe Hotel at 360 North Rodeo Drive once it is demolished. Arnault\u2019s conglomerate purchased the hotel for $200 million four years ago. The plans for the jewelry house call for a three-story building that spans 30,000 square feet and include a rooftop indoor-outdoor space.\nPlus, LVMH submitted plans to build a big, new Louis Vuitton store \u2014 after voters voted against an earlier proposal for a hotel \u2014 and a ritzy campus on Rodeo Drive. Not to mention, a three-story Bvlgari store is opening next month.\nLVMH has spent more than $900 million on 12 leased or owned stores on Rodeo Drive in recent years.\n",

        "content": "Sellers are cutting their prices, inventory\u2019s sitting on the market a bit longer, and condo buyers especially have more selection to choose from.\nHome and condo sales have also been declining for months, and price growth is slower than before.\nThese are some of the signs that point to a buyer\u2019s market in parts of South Florida. I\u2019m not talking about the turnkey, ultra-high-end part of the market, though those properties aren\u2019t flying off the shelves either.\nEverywhere I look, I see price cuts \u2014 $70,000 here, $10,000 there. Or, for the more expensive homes, listings are reduced by $5 million or $6 million. (Rarely do I see a price increase, though it happens.)\nThat doesn\u2019t mean all sellers are losing money, based on their purchase prices. But they\u2019re adjusting their expectations as the days on market tick up for their properties. \u201cMake an offer, you never know what could happen,\u201d a listing agent urged me when I told them a house was out of my price range. That property just got a $10,000 price cut.\nHomebuyers are also increasingly backing out of purchases in some markets in part because they have more options. A\nRedfin report\nreleased this summer found that home buys are most likely to fall through in Texas and Florida. More than 21 percent of pending home purchases were canceled in July in Fort Lauderdale, among the major U.S. cities with the biggest increase of sales that collapsed. In Miami, about 17 percent of signed home contracts were canceled in July, the same as last July, according to the report.\nBuyers have\nthe most\nchoices when it comes to condos, because sellers want to offload their units. Many condo associations are instituting special assessments to pay for repairs and maintenance to increase dues to fill a building\u2019s financial reserves. High monthly fees, or the fear that owners will have to shell out tens of thousands of dollars on top of normal maintenance costs, are keeping buyers away from some buildings.\nThe question is, how much more will pricing fall? When and where is rock bottom?\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat are the weakest links in\nWest Palm Beach\u2019s new development\ncondo pipeline? Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\n\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential:\nDr. Nicole Martin, a former \u201cReal Housewives of Miami\u201d star, and her fianc\u00e9, attorney Anthony Lopez, purchased a seven-bedroom home at\n33 Arvida Parkway\nfor $34 million, 28 percent off its asking price of $47 million. Real estate investor Rafael Perez sold the property.\nCommercial:\nChicago-based Waterton Residential sold a 427-unit apartment complex known as\nDistrict West Gables\nat 2001 and 2101 Ludlam Road/Southwest 67th Avenue in West Miami for $111 million. Federal Capital Partners bought the property.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nPedro Adrian, founder of Adrian Homes, and his wife, Adria Adrian, listed their waterfront Palm Island mansion in Miami Beach for $59 million. The 11,639-square-foot, five-bedroom, five-bathroom house at 145 Palm Avenue is being marketed as a teardown by listing agent Chad Carroll of Compass. The 1.4-acre property includes the adjacent lot at 149 Palm Avenue, home to a tennis court. The Adrians paid $240,000 for the main property in 1984, and $200,000 for the lot next door in 1986.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\nEnrollment at public schools across Florida is falling. Miami-Dade County saw a drop of 13,000 students. In Broward, enrollment fell by about 11,000 students. And in Orange County, budget planners predicted a 7,000-student decline. Miami-Dade County Public Schools superintendent Jose Dotres\nsaid the drops\ncan be attributed to a decrease in immigrant students, lower birth rate and rising costs of living.\nElsewhere in Florida\nMiami commissioner Miguel Angel Gabela wants the city to \u201cinstitute a civil action\u201d against fellow commissioner Joe Carollo to recover millions in taxpayer-funded legal fees spent defending him in a federal case that led to a $63.5 million judgment against Carollo. The proposal will be considered at the Sept. 11 commission meeting, the\nMiami Herald\nreports.\nAn appeals court temporarily allowed Florida to keep operating Alligator Alcatraz despite a federal judge\u2019s earlier order to shut the immigration detention center down over environmental concerns, according to the\nPalm Beach Post\n.\nDonna Adelson, matriarch of a wealthy South Florida family, was convicted of first-degree murder, conspiracy and solicitation for orchestrating the 2014 killing of her former son-in-law, Florida State University law professor Daniel Markel, amid a bitter custody dispute, the\nSun Sentinel\nreports. Adelson\u2019s son was previously convicted. Markel\u2019s ex, Wendi Adelson, has denied involvement and has not been charged.\nAn Opa-locka man was arrested on theft and fraud charges after allegedly stealing over $22,000 from a North End woman via months of wire transfers. Police said he admitted plotting with an accomplice known as \u201cFat Boy\u201d to divide the money, according to the\nPalm Beach Daily News\n.\nPalm Beach County approved Lennar\u2019s plan to build 53 townhomes near Greenacres. The homebuilder will, in exchange, provide workforce housing units off-site and contribute more than $570,000 toward future projects. While Lennar argued the area has become denser and the project fits the neighborhood, some residents opposed the plan, accusing the builder of exploiting the county\u2019s workforce housing program, according to the\nPalm Beach Post\n.",

        "content": "Things are getting\ntougher in Herald Square\nfor\nJeff Sutton\n.\nThe billionaire\u2019s retail buildings at 27-29 West 34th Street have been hit with a pre-foreclosure suit. Sutton has been named as a defendant in the case for serving as a guarantor on a $50 million loan connected to the property.\nIt\u2019s the second foreclosure in recent months on the street for Sutton and his company, Wharton Properties. In June, he was named as a defendant in a suit regarding\n15 West 34th Street\n. Vacancies have grown in the area around Herald Square as rents have fallen.\nThe lender, German bank Helaba, is seeking to collect any remaining debt after foreclosure from Sutton. The bank claimed in its complaint that the borrowing entity submitted false financial statements, obscuring the amount of tax owed on the property, while also failing to enforce a master lease. Those actions trigger \u201cbad boy\u201d clauses in the guarantee agreement, the bank argued, making Sutton liable.\nIn April, delinquent taxes on the properties totaled more than $12 million, according to court filings. Outstanding principal balance on the loan is $48.4 million, according to the bank. Annual property taxes on the lot are currently about $1.8 million, according to city documents.\nSutton acquired the buildings in a joint venture with SL Green in 2006. The deal totaled $30 million and included a third adjacent building, with the publicly traded developer financing a portion of Sutton\u2019s equity, according to financial disclosures first reported by PincusCo.\nBut by 2016, Sutton was signing the paperwork for the owner.\nThe footwear brand Geox signed a 15-year lease at No. 29 in 2007, but filed for bankruptcy in 2021, according to Commercial Observer. Base rent was $2.6 million in 2021. The company agreed to pay Wharton Properties $8.8 million. The site is now occupied by a souvenir shop. However, that store, along with Superdry located at No. 25, have both indicated intent to vacate, according to a person familiar.\nFootwear brand Aldo signed a 15-year lease on No. 27 in 2009. In 2018, the brand\u2019s annual rent on the space was $2.3 million, according to court documents.\n\nUps and downs in a legacy retail corridor\nThe Herald Square area has seen\nflagging interest from retailers\n. The average asking rent has fallen nearly 10 percent year over year in the first half of 2025, now coming in at $447 per square foot, according to the most recent figures from the Real Estate Board of New York. The asking rent is down 59 percent from its peak in 2015.\nThe\nnumber of available storefronts\nin the corridor rose from 14 in the first half of 2024 to 21 in the same period this year.\nMajor retailers, including the Gap, Victoria\u2019s Secret, American Eagle, Uniqlo, and Zumiez, have departed from the corridor in recent years. Forever 21 moved from West 34th Street to Seventh Avenue before the pandemic and has since closed all its stores as a result of bankruptcy.\nVacant space and less foot traffic can accelerate decline. Flagging rents combined with steady or rising property taxes can make it difficult for property owners to refinance.\nBut the situation varies block by block, said Dan Biederman, president of the 34th Street Partnership. The block between Seventh and Eighth Avenues has been feeling tailwinds from some of the redevelopment developer Vornado has been doing in its Penn District.\nBut the block from Fifth Avenue to Sixth Avenue, where Nos. 27 and 29 are located, hasn\u2019t done as well.\n\u201cFifth to Sixth is generally up from the pandemic times,\u201d Biederman said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a varied group of owners and you never know when a retail site is going to go upwards in quality or downwards.\u201d\nThere are some bright spots for Herald Square. Old Navy inked a lease at No. 50 earlier this year, moving from its former location at No. 150, now occupied by Primark. The lease represents a bullish attitude on the neighborhood, Richard Cohan, retail adviser for partnership, said in June.\nNeither Sutton or a lawyer for Helaba immediately responded to a request for comment.\n",

The firm\u2019s head of credit strategies, Anthony Shaskus, said they hoped to also provide construction financing for the project, the release shows.\nThe developers launched sales for\nthe Berkeley\n, a 25-story, 193-unit tower planned for 601 and 621 Clearwater Park Road, in December. Floorplans range from two- to five-bedrooms, and the tower will have four penthouses, according to the release. Arquitectonica is the architect and prices range from $2 million to $10 million. Adelson and his partners opted for an in-house sales team, which is led by Joe Conwell, the project\u2019s website shows. Adelson confirmed the project is between 12 percent and 15 percent presold.\nThe project is near the sites for the planned\nVanderbilt University\ngraduate school campus and\nCleveland Clinic\n. With this proximity, as well as walkability to the planned office towers in downtown West Palm Beach, Adelson said he believes the tower will be a draw to buyers looking for convenience. He also expects about a third of the buyers to be snowbirds and retirees, he said.\n\nConstruction is slated to begin in June of 2026, he said. But Adelson also acknowledged the slowing market could disrupt his plans.\n\u201cThe market in South Florida has slowed down a bit, I think anyone you talk to will tell you that,\u201d he said, adding that he expects interest rates to come down in the near future and boost the market. He also pointed to a possible Zohran Mamdani-related migration wave from New York.\nAdelson is known in West Palm Beach for building\nthe Bristol\n, the city\u2019s premier luxury condo building. He and Gene Golub completed the 25-story, 69-unit building in 2019, making it the first new condominium in the city in more than a decade. Last year, a penthouse in the tower sold for a record\n$28 million\n.\nNow, the Berkeley is one of more than a dozen condo projects in the\ncity\u2019s development pipeline\n. This loan brings the pipeline\u2019s financing total to $1.4 billion.",

The new owner renamed the property The Adeline.\nThe buyer is listed as 1031 Exchange Professionals, a 1031 exchange intermediary specializing in the facilitation of tax-deferred exchanges of business and investment property led by David Kuns. The firm bought the property on behalf of Charleston-based Greystar, which manages and operates over $300 billion of real estate in nearly 250 markets globally.\n\u201cWe facilitated a reverse exchange on behalf of a client,\u201d Kuns said declining to cite the client\u2019s name.

        "content": "The evidence of\nineffective programs to help rent-stabilized landlords\nkeeps piling up.\nThe latest example, uncovered by Gothamist, is that\nonly one owner has applied\nfor the city\u2019s Unlocking Doors offer of $25,000 for owners who fix up low-rent apartments that have been vacant at least two years and lease them to low-income voucher holders.\nThe lone applicant backed out. So, no money has been awarded in the 20 months since Unlocking Doors launched in December 2023. (Mayor Eric Adams\nunveiled it\neight months before, but it took the city most of the year to get it started.) The city is now upping the offer to $50,000.\nDoes the lack of participation prove that few low-rent apartments have been vacant for years? Clearly not.\nWhether the number is less than\n2,500\n(as the Department of Housing Preservation and Development claims) or\n13,000\n(Independent Budget Office) or 50,000 (New York Apartment Association), an effective program would have awarded more than zero grants.\nIts failure should come as no surprise. Landlord groups complained at the outset that the pilot program was created without their input and that it was too small at just $10 million for 400 apartments. Building permit fees alone would eat up much of the $25,000, and renovations of long-vacant apartments typically cost several times more than that, landlord representative Jay Martin said at the time.\nFour months later, in August 2023, Martin, who was then executive director of the Community Housing Improvement Program, told\nThe Real Deal\n, \u201cHousing providers have not been interested in the program because of the restrictive parameters.\u201d\nBesides the two-year vacancy requirement, apartments must have rents of no more than $1,200 for a one-bedroom and $1,400 for a three-bedroom. Another issue is that many landlords view voucher holders as high-risk tenants.\n\n\u201cSection 8 = tenants for life and we\u2019re not talking the cream of the crop,\u201d one reader\nposted\nat the bottom of the Gothamist story.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think $50,000 is enough to make this worthwhile. A single bathroom renovation in NYC can easily run around $25,000, which already eats up half the budget,\u201d another\nwrote\n. \u201cOn top of that, the rent would be capped at $1,200 [for a one-bedroom], so the return doesn\u2019t justify the upfront cost. There\u2019s also the added risk under New York laws that a tenant \u2014 or even a squatter \u2014 could stop paying rent, leaving me with expenses and no income.\u201d\nIf tenants stop paying, it can take\ntwo years\nand cost many thousands of dollars in legal fees to evict them. (For those of you who have been following the case of\nTasheem Jenkins\n, last month a judge gave him another reprieve until at least mid-September. And Jenkins was an unauthorized subletter, not even a tenant.)\nOperating costs for rent-stabilized buildings are about\n$1,250 per unit\n. That doesn\u2019t mean owners save $1,250 every month a unit is vacant, but they have made clear that they won\u2019t sink money into units that pay little rent and could saddle them with a problematic tenant for years, even decades.\n\u201cOf course landlords won\u2019t accept 25k or even 50k in exchange for never again making any profit. $1,400/mo is basically break even in NYC,\u201d a Gothamist reader posted. \u201cI would never accept it after having waited decades for old tenants to finally vacate, and then be reliant on the city to pay an absurdly low rent that provides zero profit forever.\u201d\nThe reader went on: \u201cNot to mention Mandani\u2019s upcoming four year\nrent freeze\n! Better to just lock the doors of these low-rent dumps and wait for the laws to change.\u201d\nThe commenter added, \u201cFYI, a decent renovation with permits costs at least 100k, so at minimum the city needs to double their offer.\u201d\n",

The Sioni Group is the contracted buyer; neither firm responded to requests for comment from the outlet.\nThe sale price is more than half off what Ortega paid to acquire the building roughly two decades ago, when he spent $115.5 million for the office building. The property spans 85,000 square feet, breaking down the latest sale to $588 per square foot.\nAn Eastdil Secured team including Will Silverman, Gary Phillips, Jeff Organisciak is advising on the deal, according to the\nCommercial Observer\n.\nOrtega\u2019s been buying properties all over the globe in recent years, but even the founder of the Zara fast fashion empire isn\u2019t immune from the post-pandemic office doldrums.\nThis summer, Pontegadea bought the 30-story Sabadell Financial Center in Miami\u2019s Brickell for about\n$275 million\nand the 44-story, 259-unit Veneto Las Olas apartment tower in downtown Fort Lauderdale for\n$165 million\n.\n\nGlobally, his firm recently paid\n$113 million\nfor the five-star 90-key Hotel Banke in central Paris. And in May, it paid\n$284 million\nfor a 290,000-square-foot office building in Barcelona that houses the headquarters of Spanish book publisher Planeta.\nAs of July, Forbes put his net worth at $115 billion, which made him the 13th richest person worldwide at the time.\nEven if Ortega\u2019s net worth puts him in a different stratosphere from most, he can take solace in knowing he\u2019s not alone in Manhattan\u2019s tricky office market.\nJust last week, Savanna entered into contract to buy the leasehold on Westbrook Partners\u2019 444 Madison Avenue\nfor $50 million\n. Westbrook bought the lease on the 1930s-era office building for $314 million in 2007, but recently defaulted on its Wells Fargo $120 million loan.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "No action was taken by Texas state lawmakers after an acrimonious spat on whether hemp-derived THC products may continue legal sales in the state.\nThousands of Texas hemp retailers can keep their doors open for the foreseeable future. The Texas Legislature\u2019s second special session ended without any bills regarding the regulation or outright ban of cannabis products winning approval, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who presides over the State Senate, wrote on X last week that he, Gov. Greg Abbott and House Speaker Dustin Burrows were unable to reach a resolution they could all live with. Patrick had pushed for a complete THC ban which passed both chambers during the regular legislative session, but\nAbbott\nvetoed the bill.\nPatrick\u2019s Senate Bill 3 would have effectively banned the sale of most THC products derived from hemp, including Delta-8 and Delta-9 gummies and vapes. It was ultimately vetoed by Abbott, who cited a need to better define what products would be restricted and a regulatory framework during the special session.\nThe bill threatened to eliminate an estimated $8 billion in annual revenue across 8,500 stores, causing ripple effects on\nretail real estate\n.\n\nThe Republican-majority body and governor did agree on a ban specifically targeting vapes. Senate Bill 2024 banned vapes containing THC and hemp-derived cannabinoids, such as Delta-8, during the regular session. The bill banned vaping devices other than for nicotine, including cannabinoids, kratom, kava, mushrooms and tianeptine.\nThe next regular session of the biennial legislature will begin in January 2027, but the governor could call a third special session if he deems it necessary.\nThe lack of action isn\u2019t just a win for retailers but also Texas farmers who grow hemp. Together with retailers, the industry in Texas has grown to more than 53,000 workers.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A weird Austin pocket listing has left the MLS for HGTV.\nThe Bouldin Treehouse, at 801 Post Oak Street, doesn\u2019t just offer the typical balance between downtown proximity and suburban seclusion. The 1,300-square-foot home was built in a trunk-like design, with wood cladding, round floor plans and a spiral staircase. The two-bedroom, two-bathroom home is asking $1.6 million, or $1,227 per square foot. There\u2019s also a one-bedroom, one-bathroom accessory dwelling unit abutting a retro Airstream RV. The parcel has been owned by Christina Campbell since 2007, and the home was built in 2013. It\u2019s been listed as a rental off and on since 2017, never for less than $3,200 a month, according to Zillow.\nKatie Jackson of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate @properties Lone Star has the listing, and she marketed it live on the HGTV show \u201cZillow Gone Wild\u201d last week.\nTravis County appraised the property at $1.2 million this year, down from $1.4 million last year. The house is less valuable than the land itself; the lot is appraised at $625,000 this year, and the improvements are appraised at $577,000.\n\nAlthough the unique design and ADU are points of pride on the listing website, Jackson\u2019s sales pitch isn\u2019t exactly to keep Austin weird. The listing teases the \u201copportunity to redevelop\u201d the prime land. Jackson pointed out that the quarter-acre lot is big enough to accommodate up to three structures\nunder the Austin HOME Initiative\n.\nThe seller listed the home on the MLS this spring but wasn\u2019t satisfied with the top offers, Jackson said. The producers of the HGTV show contacted her shortly after the home hit Zillow.\nLike markets around the country, Austin is adjusting to high supply and cautious buyers. While sellers have wielded some negotiating power in lower-price suburbs this summer,\nluxury is decidedly a buyer\u2019s market\n, according to Austin agents. The weakening luxury submarket is possibly due to\nfaltering corporate interest in Austin\n.\n",

The total was down from 16 in the\nprevious period\nand was less than the decade average of 17 pending sales in the week after Labor Day.\nThe priciest home to find a buyer was a condo at JDS Development and Property Markets Group\u2019s 111 West 57th Street, which asked $22 million. The 4,200-square-foot apartment initially asked just under $28 million when it was marketed off of floorplans nine years ago.\nUnit 58 has three bedrooms and three bathrooms. It also features a great room with 14-foot ceilings and views of Central Park.\nThe condo was the 10th unit at the Billionaires\u2019 Row tower to land among the top two contracts in Olshan\u2019s report so far this year, including a 42nd-floor apartment that found a buyer last month with an asking price of\n$23 million\n.\nOf the supertall\u2019s 60 units, 49 have notched closed deals with a price per square foot averaging roughly $4,500. Amenities at the building include a fitness center, pool, terrace and private dining room.\nThe Nikki Field Team with Sotheby\u2019s International heads sales at the building.\n\nThe second most expensive home to enter contract was a condo at 250 West Street, asking $14.5 million. The Tribeca apartment, which hit the market in April, spans 4,100 square feet and has four bedrooms and four bathrooms.\nUnit 9A last traded for just under $12 million when Christopher Heinz, former Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s stepson, and his wife, Alexandra, sold it to an anonymous LLC in 2016.\nThe corner unit also features a library, views of the Hudson River and two storage units on the same floor.\nAmenities in the 12-story condominium, where natural gas magnate Michael Smith sold a penthouse for\n$60 million\nlast year, include doormen, a fitness center, pool and rooftop terrace.\nCorcoran\u2019s Richard Ziegelasch had the listing.\nOf the 15 properties, 10 were condos and five were co-ops.\nThe homes\u2019 combined asking price was $130 million, for an average price of $8.7 million and a median of $6.4 million. The typical home spent more than a year and a half on the market and was discounted 6 percent from the original listing price.\n",

        "content": "It is not every day that a community board in New York City asks for more housing.\nYet Community Board 6 has been pushing the Adams administration to help it create a housing plan for Manhattan\u2019s East Side. In fact, as part of the approval of two life science projects in the district, the administration committed to helping craft such a plan.\nBut the process has been painfully slow and contentious, despite the Adams administration\u2019s claim that it\u2019s the most housing-friendly mayorship in the history of New York City.\nIn February, the City Council approved Science Park and Research Campus, or SPARC, a redevelopment of the Hunter College Brookdale campus and Innovation East, which will replace the former public health lab. The administration framed the pair as \u201cgenerational life science projects\u201d that together will add some 1.5 million square feet of life science space to Kips Bay.\nAhead of the approvals, some\nquestioned\nthe wisdom of moving forward with life science projects as demand for such space softened. The mayor signed an executive order last year directing all city agencies to analyze city-owned sites for housing opportunities \u2014 and here were two city-owned sites that would not include any housing.\nStill, when it came to SPARC, the administration indicated that after \u201cintensive community review and engagement,\u201d it determined that affordable housing was not viable at the site. During a hearing on the project in September, a representative with the Economic Development Corporation said that \u201chaving jobs that New Yorkers of all backgrounds can access, that can pay for housing, is also an important part of delivering affordable housing and having an affordable city.\u201d\nMeanwhile, vacancy rates for life science space in New York City have sat in the double digits, most recently hitting 39 percent in the second quarter of 2025, according to a\nrecent report\nby Newmark. Competitor Alexandria Real Estate Equities, working on the third phase of its own life science project nearby, also\nurged\nthe city to consider a different use for SPARC, including housing.\nWhen it became clear that the administration would not incorporate housing into the projects, City Council members Carlina Rivera and Keith Powers secured a different commitment: the Department of City Planning would meet with the community board to develop a housing plan.\nThe agency met with the community board in May, and some members walked away frustrated that City Planning had not made any specific commitments to move forward with a district-specific plan. The agency is focused on a broader \u201cManhattan Plan,\u201d which the mayor has said will add 100,000 housing units across the borough over the next decade.\n\u201cBecause it is Manhattan-wide, it doesn\u2019t really acknowledge the specifics of our district,\u201d said Sandra McKee, chair of the community board.\n\nDuring a June 9 meeting of the community board\u2019s land use and waterfront committee, Gigi Li, a vice president with the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation, acknowledged concerns raised about the meeting and said EDC and City Planning were \u201cregrouping.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re aware, we\u2019re working on it and we\u2019ll be back with you guys soon,\u201d she said.\nSince then, the community board went on summer break and Rivera, who is term-limited, resigned from the Council to head the New York State Association for Affordable Housing.\nThe administration\u2019s focus appears to still be the Manhattan Plan, which is expected to be released by the end of the year. Some aspects of the plan have already been announced and factor into its housing projections, including the Midtown South rezoning and the redevelopment of sites like 100 Gold Street.\nA spokesperson for the Department of City Planning said the agency is \u201cdeeply appreciative\u201d of the board\u2019s \u201cdesire to find opportunities for growth to create more housing.\u201d\n\u201cFor now, we\u2019ve encouraged the board, and all New Yorkers, to participate in the Manhattan Plan, which looks to create 100,000 new homes throughout the borough,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cFollowing that plan\u2019s release, we will return to CB6 to further the conversation on housing opportunities in their district.\u201d\nA representative for EDC did not respond to questions about the status of discussions.\nMayor Eric Adams has repeatedly referred to his administration as the most pro-housing in the city\u2019s history. His administration aims to complete two more neighborhood rezonings by the end of the year, including a major Long Island City undertaking that could net 14,700 apartments, as well as another in Jamaica that\u2019s expected to create 12,000 homes.\nAt the same time, multiple reports have indicated that the Trump administration is trying to create a path for Adams to quit his bid for re-election. How that plays out could shift what projects get priority and how much momentum new initiatives, like Community Board 6\u2019s housing plan, are able to pick up in the final months of the administration.\n",

The sale, which closed on July 31 and was recorded in city property records last week, was first reported by\nPincusCo\n.\nRXR, the Qatar Investment Authority and Macquarie Capital had invested $261 million in the portfolio in 2022, when Gotlib and Orbach\u2019s GO Partners\npaid $850 million\nfor the three apartment buildings developed by the late Sheldon Solow. Together, the buildings span more than 1.17 million square feet and hold 1,174 apartments, according to PincusCo.\nThe buyout closed on the same day Gotlib and Orbach took their new company,\nGO Residential REIT\n, public in Toronto. The IPO proceeds funded the purchase of RXR\u2019s interest, according to the filing. In addition to the three Lenox Hill towers, the REIT controls a 408-unit building at 685 First Avenue and the 761-unit Copper Apartments at 626 First Avenue, once the American Copper Buildings, which Gotlib and Orbach\npurchased in 2022\nfor $837 million.\n\nFor RXR, the deal marks a tidy win. The towers\u2019 value was appraised this year at $1.17 billion, a 38 percent jump since the 2022 acquisition.\nGO Residential REIT plans to raise rents to reach market-rate levels, including upgrading units, the firm announced when it went public. The firm plans to seek other paths of growth, including renting amenity spaces for additional revenue streams.\nRepresentatives from RXR and GO did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the sale.\n",

The properties spent 108 days on the market, on average.\nFifty-three luxury listings were added to the market, for a total of 1,100 listings.\nThe\nprevious week\n, buyers signed contracts for 16 properties in Miami-Dade, asking a combined $195 million.\nThe asking dollar volume for the 12 single-family homes and three condos under contract last week totals $132.7 million, according to the report, which is authored by the Douglas Elliman team led by Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes.\nThe single-family homes that entered into contract last week have an average asking price of $9.5 million and spent an average of 72 days on the market. They total $114.2 million in asking dollar volume.\n\nThe priciest home to secure a buyer last week is the 20,182-square-foot mansion at 6555 Southwest 102nd Street in Pinecrest. The 10-bedroom, 10-and-a-half-bathroom home, on a 2-acre lot, is on the market for $21.8 million. Julian Johnston of the Corcoran Group has the listing. Property records show Trevor L. Taylor owns the home.\nIn 2022, Taylor was charged with conspiracy to commit securities fraud, investment adviser fraud and wire fraud; a separate securities fraud charge, and a separate investment adviser fraud charge. The Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Taylor, two other former senior portfolio managers at Allianz Global Investors US, and Allianz were involved in a massive investment fraud. The scheme resulted in the loss of billions of dollars that included pension funds for teachers, clergy, bus drivers, engineers and other working professionals, according to the complaint. Taylor pleaded guilty. He reached an agreement with the SEC that bars him from the securities industry and from the brokering or sales/purchases of penny stocks.\nTaylor\u2019s property in\nPinecrest\n, built in 2022, includes a pool deck, spa, cold plunge, a separate 1,000-square-foot gym, a tennis court and more, according to the listing. Taylor and his ex-wife paid $3.2 million for the property in 2017.\nThe condos that secured buyers last week have an average asking price of $6.2 million and spent 251 days on the market, on average. They total $18.5 million in asking dollar volume, or an average of $1,798 per square foot.\nThe most expensive condo to enter into contract is the 4,247-square-foot condo at Estates at Acqualina, at 17975 Collins Avenue in Sunny Isles Beach. The four-bedroom, six-and-a-half-bathroom condo, unit 601 in the north tower, is on the market with Dezer Platinum Realty\u2019s Anna Zhukovich. It\u2019s asking $7.7 million. It previously sold for $6.8 million in 2023.\nLast week in New York, buyers signed contracts for 15 homes, according to the latest\nOlshan\nreport. Their combined asking price is $130.1 million, and the typical home spent 584 days on the market.\n",

        "content": "The owner of a historic building in downtown Oakland has filed for bankruptcy following a loan default and looming foreclosure.\nLamumba, doing business as Geoffrey\u2019s Inner Circle, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, setting the company up to delay a foreclosure on the building\u2019s $4.3 million loan while a federal court oversees its efforts to reorganize its finances, the Mercury News\nreported\n.\nThe building, at 410 14th Street and 1411 Franklin Street, is valued at $12 million, according to court papers cited by the outlet. In legal documents, Lamumba CEO Geoffrey Pete said the property was last appraised in 2018 for $8.4 million and that he was working to obtain an updated appraisal report.\nProperty lender Tellone Mortgage Fund filed a notice of default in April saying that the loan Tellone provided Lamumba in 2021 was delinquent.\nThe four-story structure was built in 1901 and is known as the Athenian-Nile Club Building.\nThe ground floor contains retail space, while the second floor is used for live events and a jazz music venue, and the third floor boasts a large ballroom and commercial kitchen.\n\nPete previously sought to stop the development of a 40-story residential tower next door but was unsuccessful. He argued in past Oakland Planning Commission and Oakland City Council meetings that the proposed tower would hurt his longtime business. At the last minute before a final hearing in January 2024, Pete withdrew his appeal, making way for Tidewater Capital to build the residences.\nPete reportedly abandoned his appeal against the housing tower after the Oakland City Council assured him that the city could provide financial resources to Geoffrey\u2019s Inner Circle and the Black Art Movement and Business District. That August, Pete claimed that the item to finalize approval of those resources was removed from the City Council agenda multiple times,\naccording\nto the Oakland Post.\nThough the housing high-rise is approved, the timeline for development and completion is unclear.\nPete\u2019s purchase of the building in 1993 kicked off the transformation of the formerly all-white, men\u2019s only club into a cultural hub in downtown Oakland. Besides Geoffrey\u2019s Inner Circle, merchants located in the historic building include Fourteenth Street Market, Timbuktu 1, Yoko African Art, Minto\u2019s Jamaican Patties and Juice Bar, Oakland Ink, Joyce Gordon Gallery, Central Nails and Truve Fit.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The listing for the 7,200-square-foot home breaks down to an even $6,875 per square foot.\nThe Krakoffs bought the land from photographer Antoine Verglas for $10.5 million in 2018.\nThe six-bedroom home is situated on a three-acre estate with 200 feet of ocean frontage. There\u2019s a pool, five guest rooms, a gym and a garage.\nThe design of the estate may be its true calling card. The home was built only two years ago, but was crafted by Thomas Phifer and Partners to be three glass-walled pavilions atop the ground floor. The estate is gated and next to a nature preserve.\nOne pavilion has the chef\u2019s kitchen and living and dining areas, while another has the main bedroom suite and the third has a library.\n\nThe listing was first disclosed by\nBehind the Hedges\n. Hedgerow Exclusive Properties has the\nlisting\n.\nKrakoff is the creative chair at John Hardy, but has also held posts at Coach and Tiffany &amp; Company. His wife, Delphine, is an acclaimed interior designer.\nIn addition to their artistic endeavors, the Krakoffs have quite the real estate history, including on the East End. They\nonce owned Lasata\n, a summer destination of Jackie Kennedy Onassis. They bought it in 2007 for $20 million and sold it 11 years later to television and film producer David Zander.\nThey own a property in New Canaan, Connecticut that spans 52 acres; after purchasing it for $14.3 million in 2014, they\u2019re looking to sell for $25.5 million. The couple has also owned lavish townhomes on the Upper East Side that they sold for $15 million in 2007 and $51 million in 2014, respectively.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A development firm plans a 211-unit multifamily complex with some workforce units in south Miami-Dade County\u2019s Naranja neighborhood.\nThe project comes amid a massive pipeline of apartments, townhomes and single-family homes in south Miami-Dade. Developers have seized on the area partly due to its vast supply of land that comes at a discount compared to sites elsewhere in the county.\nAlcazar Development Group plans the Aura Living apartment complex on a 4.3-acre vacant site on the southeast corner of Southwest 280th Street/Waldin Drive and Southwest 152nd Avenue in unincorporated Miami-Dade, according to the firm\u2019s filings to the county last week.\nSouth Miami-based Alcazar filed a Florida Housing Finance Corporation \u201czoning verification\u201d last week to the county, which is required for developers to secure funding and incentives for affordable and workforce housing projects. FHFC provides state and federal loans and grants for projects that include below-market rate units.\nAt Aura Living, at least 12.5 percent of apartments, or 27 units, will be at workforce rents, according to filings to the county. In Miami-Dade, workforce apartments are designated for households earning from 60 percent to 140 percent of the area median income.\nMiami-Dade\u2019s annual AMI is $87,200, according to the Florida Housing Finance Corporation.\nThe project scored administrative site plan approval in 2021. Designed by Anillo. Toledo. Lopez, the complex will consist of a pair of six-story buildings and one four-story building, county records show.\nAlcazar paid $3.1 million for the development site in 2015, property records show.\n\nAlcazar \u2013\u2013 led by Jose Jorge Figueroa, Justo Fernandez and Guillermo Villar \u2013\u2013 is a residential and multifamily private development firm, according to its website.\nIn 2018, Alcazar completed the three-story, 288-unit The Olivia garden-style apartment complex on the northeast corner of Southwest 284th Street and Southwest 150th Avenue in south Miami-Dade\u2019s Leisure City neighborhood. The complex is near the Aura Living development site.\nAlcazar sold The Olivia to an entity tied to Artemis Real Estate Partners and Grand Peaks for $70.5 million in 2021, records show.\nMost of Alcazar\u2019s other planned projects are in south Miami-Dade, according to the firm\u2019s website.\nDevelopers eager to start residential projects amid South Florida\u2019s high housing demand have\nhomed in\non\nsouth Miami-Dade\n. The area is home to the municipalities of Homestead and Florida City, as well as unincorporated neighborhoods such as\nNaranja\n, Leisure City,\nPrinceton\nand Goulds.\nNear Alcazar\u2019s proposed Aura Living, MAS AJP \u2013\u2013 led by Alberto Perez and Juan Carlos \u201cJ.C.\u201d Mas \u2013\u2013 plans the massive 200-plus-acre\nMandarin Lakes Traditional Neighborhood Development\n, a mixed-use project in Naranja with more than 500 residential units and 82,000 square feet of commercial space. Coral Gables-based MAS AJP wants to start with a three-story row house complex with 132 homes and a two-story row house complex with 161 homes on a 27-acre site on the northeast corner of South Dixie Highway and Southwest 280th Street.\nElsewhere in Naranja, Brickell-based Aconcagua plans a seven-story,\n239-unit\napartment building on the northeast corner of South Dixie Highway and Southwest 264th Avenue/Bauer Drive. Also, Shadi Shomar, Gonzalo De Ramon, brothers Ghassan and Roger Abboud and Royal American Construction plan a pair of eight-story apartment buildings with\n278 units\n, combined, at 23435 Southwest 127th Avenue in Naranja.\n",

        "content": "The Chicago Bears are preparing to unveil the most detailed proposal yet for a new stadium in Arlington Heights, ditching efforts for direct public subsidies but digging in on long-term property-tax breaks.\nThe team is expected to roll out a formal proposal this fall, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. The impending proposal is the most conclusive evidence so far that the team plans to build a domed stadium and mixed-use district in the northwestern suburb.\nThe Bears have long eyed the 326-acre former\nArlington International Racecourse\nsite, which the team bought for $197 million in February 2023. The latest plan calls for restaurants, entertainment and housing alongside the stadium, with team officials projecting about 9,000 permanent jobs. The project would allow Illinois to host marquee events like the Super Bowl and NCAA Final Four.\n\nWhat sets the Bears\u2019\nproposal\napart from recent stadium deals in Nashville and Buffalo \u2014 which secured $1 billion-plus in taxpayer subsidies \u2014 is the team\u2019s pledge to fund construction privately. But that doesn\u2019t mean the team is going it alone. Executives are pressing Springfield to let them negotiate long-term property tax assessments, a move critics say would still amount to a major public concession. Two pending bills could provide a framework, but lawmakers are unlikely to\nact\nuntil spring. The Bears would contribute $2 billion, and the NFL would pony up $300 million, but the team would still seek $900 million from the\nstate\nto make the projected $3.2 billion cost of the stadium build\nwork\n.\nChicago leaders are wary. City officials don\u2019t want to be seen as helping the Bears leave Soldier Field, where the team\u2019s lease runs through 2033, and some argue the franchise should first pay off the $534 million in debt tied to the stadium\u2019s 2003 renovation. An early exit would cost the team up to $84 million.\nMayor Jim Tinaglia of Arlington Heights called the stadium a \u201cwin-win\u201d for the suburbs and city alike. Supporters also note that only three NFL venues \u2014 the Los Angeles Chargers\u2019 SoFi Stadium, the New York Giants and Jets\u2019 MetLife Stadium and the New England Patriots\u2019 Gillette Stadium \u2014 were built entirely with private dollars, and each leveraged tax breaks or nearby entertainment zones.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

In the week following last year\u2019s Labor Day holiday, the borough saw 17 contracts signed for $58 million.\nThe top contract last week went to a townhouse at 130 Fort Greene Place asking $5 million.\nThe 19th-century home was previously sold for $2.6 million in 2014 and underwent extensive renovations.\nAt 20 feet wide, the townhouse spans almost 3,800 square feet and has seven bedrooms and four full bathrooms.\nThe parlor level has herringbone wood floors, 11-foot ceilings with plaster detailing and moldings and oversized windows, and a wood-burning fireplace framed by an original marble mantel with restored crown moldings. A private terrace from the kitchen leads to the backyard.\nThe second-floor primary suite features a walk-in closet, an ensuite marble bathroom with dual vanities and a walk-in rain shower. A secondary bedroom features a decorative fireplace and a private terrace.\nThe top floor has three bedrooms, a laundry room and a flexible fourth room. The garden level features a renovated two-bedroom apartment with a private entrance.\nCompass\u2019 Suzanne Koxvold, Mia Lieberman and Rachel Greenstein had the listing.\n\nThe second priciest listing went to a unit asking $3 million at 205 14th Street, a boutique condo building in Park Slope.\nThe unit, listed as the townhouse, is the most expensive of the five units in the building, the other four of which have been sold.\nIt was originally listed for $4.5 million in June 2024 by a Nest Seekers team, before being relisted last October for $3.5 million by a different Nest Seekers team.\nThis June, it was listed at its last asking price by Serhant\u2019s Andrew Appell and David Fernandez.\nSpanning over 3,900 square feet, the triplex comes with three bedrooms and three bathrooms and \u201clives like a standalone townhouse,\u201d according to the StreetEasy listing.\nThe parlor level comes with 11-foot ceilings and double-height bay windows. It also holds three bedrooms, including two primary suites, one of which opens onto a private terrace.\nThe garden level features a wet bar and library nook, while the lower level runs over 50 feet deep and comes with built-in wine storage and an integrated media wall.\nRobert Saffayeh, Gabriel Saffayeh, Elie Fouerti and Vyacheslav Faybyshev bought the site, along with a second parcel at 228 East 13th Street, for $11.5 million. The group developed The Ainsley, a 28-unit condo building, on the adjacent second parcel.\nHomes in the borough entering contract last week had an average price per square foot of $1,436 and a median asking price of $2.5 million.\n",

        "content": "Vornado Realty Trust has divulged some details about its long-simmering plans for a rental tower across from Penn Station.\nThe real estate investment trust is preparing to spend roughly $350 million to build a 475-unit apartment building at the northeast corner of West 34th Street and Eighth Avenue, Vornado president Michael Franco told investors.\nThe developer plans to leverage the state\u2019s 485x program, which offers tax breaks for projects that include affordable housing, though details on how many units would be income-restricted at 484 Eighth Avenue weren\u2019t disclosed, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe Eighth Avenue site is at the heart of Roth\u2019s decades-old ambition to reimagine the Penn District. That vision stalled during the pandemic and elected officials have since urged Vornado to prioritize housing over glassy office spires.\nThe company has already sunk $1.2 billion into revamping Penn 1 and Penn 2. It recently unveiled plans for a pedestrian bridge linking the towers\u2019 second floor, which drew pushback from community board members concerned about Empire State Building views.\n\nThe tower on Eighth Avenue would mark the latest in a major shift in strategy for Vornado, long synonymous with Midtown office towers. The firm controls 20 million square feet of commercial space but has been trimming its office footprint and leaning harder into residential. CEO Steven Roth has spent months signaling the pivot, calling out New York\u2019s apartment shortage.\nVornado has dabbled in resi before \u2014 most notably with 220 Central Park South and its stake in Tribeca\u2019s Independence Plaza \u2014 but its portfolio has remained office-heavy.\nThe rental play also comes as Vornado explores\nshedding trophy office assets\nelsewhere. Roth recently floated selling the Merchandise Mart in Chicago and its 30 percent stake in a Trump Organization-owned building at 555 California in San Francisco.\nIf executed, those exits could accelerate the REIT\u2019s strategic refocus on New York apartments.\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Pasadena is poised to add a 100-unit affordable housing complex for seniors to the city\u2019s Civic Center.\nThe Pasadena City Council is slated to vote today on key portions of an amended development and lease agreement with nonprofit developer National Community Renaissance of California advancing plans for the residences at 280 Ramona Street, Pasadena Now\nreported\n. The project is estimated to cost $83.1 million, or $831,000 per unit.\nThe agreement would amend the Pasadena Housing Department\u2019s budget to set aside $5 million in State Local Housing Trust Fund money for the project, including nearly $4.8 million in construction loans and $250,000 for administrative support.\n\nThe city\u2019s support would total $19.2 million, combining a nearly $14.5 million ground lease value with the approximately $4.8 million in state housing trust funds. Additional funding includes almost $2.8 million in federal HOME program allocations and close to $8.2 million in loans from Los Angeles County\u2019s No Place Like Home program. Developer National Community Renaissance has also applied for state Multifamily Finance funds, Low Income Housing Tax Credits, and Federal Home Loan Bank support to close a funding gap of nearly $50.7 million.\nThe Ramona Senior Housing development would include 99 units for low-income seniors and one unit for a resident manager. The five-story complex was approved by the city\u2019s design commission last year. Amenities include a community room and courtyard as well as a covered loading zone and dedicated paratransit pickup area along Ramona Street in place of on-site parking.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, the developer will lease the city-owned site for 99 years at $1 annually, with affordability locked in for the same period. The project would also be subject to Pasadena\u2019s minimum wage and local hiring ordinances. The budget and lease amendments are administrative actions not subject to the California Environmental Quality Act; the development was previously deemed exempt from\nCEQA approvals\nunder the in-fill housing category.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Chicago affordable housing builders\nCeladon Partners\nand Blackwood Group sued fellow developer Gabriel Martinez, alleging he cut them out of one of the Loop\u2019s high-profile office-to-residential conversions backed by subsidies from the city.\nCeladon, led by Scott Henry and Aron Weisner, and contractor Blackwood, led by Jose Duarte and Rafael Hernandez, filed suit in Cook County court last week accusing Martinez and his firm Primera Group of sidestepping them by handing off the planned $184 million redevelopment of the 41-story Clark Adams Building to investor Marc Calabria.\nThe project is backed by a\n$68 million subsidy awarded by the city\nin exchange for reserving at least 30 percent of the 400 units for households making less than the area median income. But Celadon and Blackwood claim they did all the work to win the subsidy yet no longer stand to benefit from the project due to Martinez\u2019s alleged dishonesty.\nCeladon and Blackwood claim they lost more than $15 million in potential fees and development upside, accusing Martinez and his partners of breach of contract, fraud and tortious interference. They argue the defendants used their confidential financials, design plans and city contacts to push through a near-identical project, and they\u2019re asking for an award of at least $15 million.\nBloomingdale-based Calabria saved the project by infusing cash into the deal for the property, at 105 West Adams Street. But Martinez only had to bring Calabria on as an investor, and ditch Celadon and Blackwood, because Martinez misled them into believing he could close on buying the building out of financial distress for $11 million, the lawsuit said.\nOld National Bank listed the building\u2019s loan\nfor sale after its previous owner, Musa Tadros, defaulted on a $29 million mortgage tied to the portion of the building Primera\u2019s venture now owns. The loan sale to Primera gave it control of the 11th through 40th floors of the Clark Adams property, which is the portion slated for the residential conversion into about 400 units, an updated plan from Celadon\u2019s original vision.\nIt was Celadon and Blackwood who were named finalists in the city\u2019s LaSalle Street Reimagined initiative, pitching a plan to turn the mostly vacant office tower into 247 apartments \u2014 75 percent of them affordable \u2014 plus ground-floor retail and a neighborhood grocer.\n\nLacking immediate financing to acquire the building from Old National, the developers say they brought in Martinez as a short-term partner. He signed a non-circumvention agreement and pledged to buy the property for $11 million, hold it until city approvals came through, then resell to the plaintiffs for $20 million.\nBut the lawsuit alleges Martinez never had the money, strung his partners along with false promises of imminent funding, then turned around and offered the deal to Calabria, an accountant. Calabria formed 105 Adams Development LLC, which ultimately bought the building in 2024 for nearly $10 million, using an $8.3 million mortgage from Millennium Bank to fund the transaction. Celadon and Blackwood also sued the LLC, which is tied to Calabria, the suit shows.\nPrimera didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\nThe new venture, with Martinez as a minority stakeholder, has since advanced its own proposal with the city \u2014 one that slashes affordable units to LaSalle Street Reimagined\u2019s minimum requirement of 30 percent of total units. But they increased the total number of units to 400 by making them smaller floorplans, according to the suit and previous reports.\nBeyond the immediate dispute, the case spotlights the high stakes and political sensitivities around\nLaSalle Street Reimagined\n, which was first brought forth by former Mayor Lori Lightfoot to revive Loop office buildings as housing or other uses. After Brandon Johnson\u2019s election, the city has continued the program to funnel subsidies toward turning outdated office towers into apartments.\nFive other proposals have moved forward under Johnson, totaling more than 1,400 residential units \u2014 including 430 affordable units. If all goes according to plan, the five projects would receive $249 million in city tax increment financing funds to subsidize the cost of the projects, according to reports earlier this year. The buildings with conversions in the works are at 79 West Monroe Street, where developer\nCampari Group and Chicago-based partner R2\nwere first of the batch to break ground in March; along with 135 South LaSalle Street, 111 West Monroe Street, 208 South LaSalle and 30 North LaSalle.\nThe initiative has been billed as a cornerstone of downtown revival, but critics warn it risks producing more market-rate units than affordable ones. If Celadon prevails, the case could reverberate through City Hall by forcing greater scrutiny on how subsidies are awarded and how developers structure partnerships to lock down site control before city approvals and tax-exempt financing are secured.\n",

        "content": "Don\u2019t expect many more condos to rise in the Austin skyline anytime soon.\nDevelopers say the city\u2019s condo pipeline is running dry after years of breakneck construction, leaving only a handful of big projects in the works. Thousands of luxury units have been delivered in the city\u2019s wealthiest zip code, 78701, in the past few years. That includes Urbanspace\u2019s 56-story Modern Austin Residences, Pearlstone Partners\u2019 41-story Vesper and Reger Holdings\u2019 28-story Linden, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n. More than 11,000 people now call downtown home, with per capita income topping $137,000 and the median home value above $700,000.\nBut that momentum is slowing. Pearlstone\u2019s Chris Zaiontz said condo supply is tapped out for at least two years, with roughly 260 unsold units still on the market between the Modern, Vesper and Linden. He blamed high interest rates and wary capital markets, which have made financing projects nearly impossible. Urbanspace\u2019s Kevin Burns predicted it could be 2029 before the next wave of condo towers gets delivered.\nApartments are filling the gap, but even that sector is struggling to absorb new supply. Downtown vacancies have hovered above 10 percent since 2021 and hit nearly 15 percent this summer, according to CoStar. More than 3,000 rental units have come online downtown in the past four years, swelling inventory by 77 percent. The 74-story Waterline, a Lincoln Property and Kairoi Residential project, is slated to deliver 352 luxury apartments next year.\n\nDevelopers see the lull as necessary and\ntemporary\n. Burns said a drop in interest rates could flip the\ncondo\nmarket into a seller\u2019s market within 18 months. Zaiontz added that Pearlstone is sitting on two downtown sites it plans to develop once financing conditions improve.\nLonger term, insiders point to the South Central Waterfront \u2014 the site of the former Austin American-Statesman headquarters \u2014 as the next frontier for high-rise growth. Major players including Endeavor, Related and Hunt have towers in the pipeline\nsouth\nof Lady Bird Lake.\nWhile the cranes may slow, developers are\nbullish\n.\n\u201cPeople are always going to live downtown,\u201d Zaiontz told the outlet. \u201cIt has so much to offer, from the food and beverage scene to the entertainment scene. We\u2019re very bullish on the continued success that downtown Austin has seen.\u201d\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

HNA lost the 48-story, 123,000-square-foot tower \u2014 which includes a separate 57-unit residential component \u2014 in an auction tied to a $64 million loan default.\nThe debt mess was part of the conglomerate\u2019s massive bankruptcy workout in 2021, when the HNA was forced to shed global real estate holdings acquired during a buying spree; the conglomerate\u2019s since been sold off and appears defunct.\n\nThe hotel itself, opened in 2010, has long been pitched as a sleek Bryant Park alternative. Amenities include a fitness center, wellness room, storage and on-site restaurant Butter, helmed by celebrity chef Alex Guarnaschelli.\nAya, led by founder Amir Shriki, is best known for its co-living apartments, fully furnished rooms rented out individually. What it plans to do with a Midtown hotel is less clear, but the buy signals Aya is extending beyond small-scale multifamily acquisitions.\nIn early 2022, the firm picked up a 25-unit Upper East Side rental at 240 East 90th Street for nearly $15 million in cash.\nLast year, Aya added a pair of Upper West Side multifamily buildings at 120 and 125 Riverside Drive to its portfolio for $31 million, a fraction of the $85 million they traded hands for in 2013.\nOther recent activity in Midtown\u2019s hotel market includes the sale of the Stewart Hotel from Jack Yadidi\u2019s Sioni Group and Isaac Chetrit\u2019s Patriarch Equities to Slate Property Group and the nonprofit Breaking Ground for approximately\n$275 million\n.

Barnett shelled out $921 million for the properties in 2022 and preservationists warn zoning allows a 1,200-foot tower, which would dwarf other properties in the neighborhood. Barnett has been\nspeaking with the community\npersonally to get this project across the finish line.\nOther projects attached to the equity via the filings include: a 600,000-square-foot tower replacing the shuttered Wellington Hotel on Seventh Avenue; a 600,000-square-foot mixed-use build on East 86th Street; an 800,000-square-foot condo-and-rental project on West 96th Street with ABS Partners; and an up to 600,000-square-foot Downtown Brooklyn tower, where Extell and Feil have spent years stitching together a blockfront on Fulton Street.\nOn Fifth Avenue, Barnett\u2019s\ndecade-long assemblage\naround 576 Fifth is poised to deliver a $1 billion, 1.1 million-square-foot office tower anchored by Manhattan\u2019s first Ikea; the retailer is reportedly kicking in nearly $300 million of its own in ordinary and preferred capital.\n\nMeanwhile, Extell filed plans to supersize 655 Madison into a 74-story mixed-use tower with Chanel reportedly in talks to\nbuy the retail condo\nfor $450 million.\nThen there\u2019s \u201cThe Torch,\u201d an 875,000-square-foot Times Square hotel-and-entertainment tower featuring a drop ride and observation deck. Extell already\nlined up $1.3 billion\nin financing from an unknown bank.\nBeyond New York, the hedge fund is also betting on Barnett\u2019s Deer Valley East Village redevelopment in Utah, where Extell broke ground on a Four Seasons resort earlier this year. Barnett\u2019s firm announced a $600 million construction loan for the project earlier this summer.\nThe exact funding for each project was not disclosed.

        "content": "The Village of Lincolnwood is weighing an aggressive move to jump-start redevelopment of its aging shopping hub.\nOfficials are considering the use of eminent domain to take over the Lincolnwood Town Center mall, a 31-acre property that\u2019s struggled for years with vacancies and ownership turnover, WMAQ\nreported\n.\nThe mall at Touhy Avenue and McCormick Boulevard is \u201cthe largest redevelopment opportunity within Chicago\u2019s inner-ring suburbs,\u201d the outlet said. The site, which opened more than 35 years ago, has cycled through owners and foreclosure proceedings. JLL was\ntapped\nto market it almost three years ago.\nLincolnwood Town Center has long been a casualty of suburban malls\u2019 slow-motion collapse. Its largest anchor, Carson\u2019s, shuttered in 2018, replaced by RoomPlace, which has 84,000 square feet. The mall\u2019s owner at the time, Washington Prime Group,\nfiled for bankruptcy\nthree years later. By 2022, the property had fallen into foreclosure, with Torchlight Investors moving to offload it. Today, Kohl\u2019s is the main draw with a footprint of 102,000 square feet, alongside about three dozen smaller tenants, but swaths of space sit empty. The mall is 81 percent occupied.\nThe village underscored its intent to \u201cassist developers with repurposing this property for the next generation of commercial retail, restaurant and hospitality uses.\u201d A redevelopment blueprint, the \u201cLincolnwood Town Center Concept Plan,\u201d was adopted by the Village Board in 2022, laying out mixed-use scenarios that include apartments, offices and entertainment.\nJLL\u2019s marketing materials pitch the 423,000-square-foot center as a \u201c1990 vintage property\u201d ripe for repositioning. The firm highlights the municipality\u2019s backing, existing lease structures and the potential to introduce multifamily, office and service retail to the site. The move also comes as other large Chicagoland\nmalls\nhave undergone major renovations or redevelopment.\n\nFor Lincolnwood, the question is no longer whether the Town Center needs a\nreset\n, but how to make it happen. Eminent domain would give the village direct control, but also risks a costly legal battle. For now, officials say they\u2019ll continue exploring the option, with further discussions expected at upcoming board meetings.\nIf the village moves forward, it would mark one of the more aggressive municipal interventions in Chicago\u2019s suburban retail\nlandscape\n\u2014 a sign of just how far traditional malls have fallen, and how valuable well-located land has become for mixed-use redevelopment.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

That\u2019s over $424,000 per unit. The buyer was a joint venture between Ethos Real Estate and Prospect Ridge, the Registry\nreported\n. The seller was an affiliate of Stockbridge Capital Group, which acquired the property for about $104 million in 2019.\nThe apartments, called the LINQ, were built in partnership between The Core Companies and Republic Urban Properties and were completed in 2016 at a cost of more than $70 million, according to The Core Companies.\nThe average price for multifamily properties with more than 100 units in the past five years was approximately $458,000, according to the Business Journal.\n\nThe complex is near San Jose\u2019s Berryessa BART station, which is set for a renaissance with commercial and residential developments surrounding the station. The advancement of\nSB 79\nin the state legislature could boost development around transit stops throughout the Bay Area if passed.\nElsewhere in San Jose, two other large multifamily properties traded hands this month.\nLast week, Sack Capital Partners and Las Palmas Housing bought the\nFountain Park\napartments at 1028 South De Anza Boulevard for $52 million. An undisclosed seller handed off the property in a deal working out to $317,000 per unit.\nPrior to that, a Greystar affiliate sold\nPark Kiely\n, a 948-unit affordable apartment complex at 355 Kiely Boulevard, in one of the South Bay\u2019s priciest multifamily transactions so far this year. That development was sold to real estate firm Standard Communities, nonprofit Housing on Merit and investment company Vistria Real Estate for $370 million, or $390,300 per unit.

        "content": "Lurin Capital was hit with a $40 million loan default lawsuit four months after\nlosing 12 Florida properties\nto foreclosure.\nSelect Securities Europe, a lender from Luxembourg, filed the lawsuit, claiming Dallas-based Lurin defaulted on 15 loans totaling $40.5 million, according to the filing in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.\nLurin defaulted on the debt when it stopped paying the interest in July 2023, the lender alleged. The loans, which matured in December 2024, were personally guaranteed by Lurin co-founders Jon and Ashley Venetos.\nSelect Securities Europe is asking the court to require Lurin to pay the full principal, interest, late fees and attorneys\u2019 fees. As of last month, Lurin owed $10.7 million in interest.\nThe lawsuit isn\u2019t the first sign of trouble for Lurin Capital.\n\nThe multifamily investor also defaulted on $383.6 million in loans from Acore Capital Mortgage, which auctioned off the 12 properties tied to the debt. Another Lurin-owned property, the 592-unit Estates at Avenstar in Houston, hit the auction block earlier this month after the firm\ndefaulted on a $52.5 million mortgage\nfrom Nexstar.\nLurin specializes in value-add apartment complexes, meaning it purchases older buildings with plans to renovate them, raise rents and sell for a profit. The strategy proved difficult to execute this cycle after rising interest rates made floating-rate debt and repairs a lot more expensive.\nMultifamily distress is on the rise\nin Texas, where operators like Lurin don\u2019t have the time or resources to hang on until interest rates are reduced.\nThis month, more than\n$700 million in CRE loans\nin Texas\u2019 largest counties were flagged for foreclosure. That\u2019s up from about $400 million in July. Most of these loans are tied to multifamily properties purchased or financed in 2021 and 2022 when values were high and debt was cheap.\nExperts warn\nit\u2019s just the beginning\n. About $19 billion in CMBS loans tied to Texas multifamily is set to mature in the next five years.\n",

        "content": "Miami, and by extension the U.S., has long dominated the realm of branded condos in luxury real estate.\nBut a new report from\nKnight Frank\nshows the Middle East is closing in on the lead. According to the report, the U.S. makes up 32.7 percent of all active\nbranded residences\nand 26.2 percent of pipeline projects, while the Middle East has 15.9 percent of active branded residences and 26.7 percent of pipeline projects.\nThese include Emirati developer Aldar\u2019s planned\nMandarin Oriental Residences\n, a 226-unit Bjarke Ingels-designed project in Abu Dhabi\u2019s Saadiyat Cultural District. Other brands with projects planned in the Middle East include Nobu, Aman, Bulgari and Waldorf Astoria.\nIt will still take years for the Middle East to rival the volume of branded projects in Miami and the greater U.S., but the numbers signal demand for these kinds of developments in both markets.\n\u201cIn absolute terms it\u2019s not the fact that the U.S. is losing ground,\u201d said Liam Bailey, the global head of research at Knight Frank. It\u2019s more thanks to a significant, sustained growth spurt in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.\n\u201cAmerica has kind of paved the way and shown how this market can evolve, and I think other regions are catching up,\u201d he said.\n\nThe report paints the picture of a global boom decades in the making. In 2011, 169 branded residences existed worldwide with a total of 27,000 units, according to the report. Today, 611 branded residences exist, and the report projects the number will rise to 1,019 by 2030. Units will total 162,000 by 2030. That equates to 500 percent growth in 20 years.\nSouth Florida leads as the North American epicenter for branded projects, with New York City close behind. That is set to shift with Miami\u2019s pipeline. Bailey confirmed the branded residence market in Miami will be almost twice the size of New York\u2019s by 2030.\nBranded projects are also a growing segment in Texas cities like Dallas with the planned\nRosewood Residences Turtle Creek\n, and Austin with the\nFour Seasons Private Residences Lake Austin\n. Los Angeles also has a growing branded residences market, with a planned Aman Beverly Hills that will include two condo towers.\nThe Knight Frank report also poked at what works \u2013\u2013 and what doesn\u2019t \u2013\u2013 in a branded condo project. Hotel brands make up 83 percent of existing branded residences worldwide, and that is projected to hover at about 80 percent with current planned projects. Projects led by non-hospitality brands, like Bentley, Major Food Group, Fendi and Baccarat have made flashy market debuts in recent years. But for developers, hospitality brands are a \u201ctried and tested formula,\u201d according to Bailey.\n\u201cThe challenge that the non-hotel brands have is the defense of their value-add,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hotel brands can say very confidently, \u2018This is our background.\u2019\u201d\n",

        "content": "Mill Creek Residential and Group P6 scored a $100.9 million construction loan for a 306-unit apartment building in downtown Boca Raton.\nThe deal comes amid a continuing flow of financing for South Florida multifamily projects, despite elevated interest rates, skyrocketing insurance and slower lease-ups of rental buildings.\nMill Creek and Group P6, both based in Boca Raton, paid $18.3 million for the development site at 400 South Dixie Highway where they plan the 13-story Modera Boca, according to records.\nThe group of sellers include The Arbor Condominium Association, led by President Keith Backer. The 1.7-acre property now is home to the two-story The Arbor building completed in 1982 with office condos, which will be demolished.\nMill Creek and Group P6 terminated the condo association on Aug. 29, the same day they closed on the purchase and construction loan, according to records.\nDesigned by Corwil Architects, Modera Boca will include a 464-space garage, Zen garden and dog park. The Boca Raton Community Redevelopment Agency\napproved\nthe project in July.\n\nMill Creek\n, led by William C. MacDonald, is a multifamily development and investment firm that had a nationwide portfolio of 152 communities with a combined 44,000 units completed or under construction at the end of first quarter, according to a Mill Creek news release issued in July on Modera Boca.\nIn the Ojus neighborhood near Aventura, the firm is developing\nModera Aventura\nwith a 15-story, 420-unit apartment building at 2681 Northeast 191st Street and 2660 Northeast 192nd Terrace. Last year, Mill Creek\nscaled down\nthe planned second building to eight stories and 251 units from 15 stories and 420 units.\nGroup P6 \u2013\u2013 led by Jose J. Padua, Jose E. Padua, Ignacio Diaz and Todd Richardson \u2013\u2013 also plans a project in Ojus, a\n21-story, 362-unit\nLive Local Act building at 2600 and 2630 Northeast 203rd Street.\nSeveral projects are on tap in\nBoca Raton\n. At the city\u2019s Tri-Rail passenger train station, Miami-based 13th Floor Investments plans an\neight-story, 340-unit\nmultifamily building with some apartments at affordable and workforce rents. The project will be at 680 West Yamato Road.\nContention has erupted over David Martin\u2019s Terra and Frisbie Group\u2019s proposal to lease city-owned land for a\n1.5 million-square-foot\ngovernment campus megaproject. Under a tentatively approved plan, Terra and Frisbie can build 912 residential units, 150 hotel keys, 350,000 square feet of offices and about 152,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space in exchange for developing a new city hall, police substation and community center. Opponents have pushed for having a say on the deal through a\nreferendum\n.\nIn other recent multifamily construction loans, Estate Companies scored\n$60 million\nthis month to build the 255-unit Soleste on the Trail garden-style complex at 7820 North Military Trail in Riviera Beach. Also this month, PPG Development, Isaac Khabie of Ark Ventures and Matt Press of EquiShares scored a\n$235 million\nconstruction financing package consisting of a loan and preferred equity investment for the 728-unit Palm Aire apartment complex at 1750 and 1775 Northeast 167th Street in North Miami Beach.",

That\u2019s three more signed contracts and an 8.7 percent rise in volume from the year-ago comparison, according to the\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n.\nThe report, compiled by Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team, counts homes listed in the Multiple Listing Service for $4 million or more.\nRoth called last week\u2019s activity a \u201cgood start\u201d to the month when also factoring in the 92 listings added to the market\u2019s inventory last week. Those new listings or re-listings reflect the biggest weekly jump since the first two weeks of July, as many sellers decided to recalibrate pricing and place their homes back on the market.\n\u201cSeller confidence in the overall market direction seems to be increasing after a slight six-week\nlull\n, with buyer activity maintaining at a relatively steady pace throughout the summer,\u201d Roth said. \u201cThe fall season is going to be something to watch.\u201d\nTopping out the list of homes that went into contract last week was a\nHancock Park\nresidence at 100 South Hudson Place. The home is being marketed for nearly $17 million, or $1,712 per square foot.\nIt\u2019s listed by Nicholas Property Group\u2019s Dustin Nicholas and Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Marc Noah.\n\nThe seller is a trust tied to inactive California attorney Samuel H. Gruenbaum, according to property records.\nKnown as the Griffith Estate for its former owner, Mary M. Griffith, the six-bedroom, 10-bathroom home sits above the Wilshire Country Club. It was built in 1929 in the Federal style, a design characterized by symmetry and Roman-inspired details. The home spans over 9,900 square feet and sits on about half an acre. The property also includes a detached guest house.\nLast week\u2019s next largest signed contract based on asking price was in Manhattan Beach along the oceanfront neighborhood known as\nThe Strand\n. Located at 708 The Strand, the home is listed for just under $15 million, or $3,314 per square foot.\nThe seller is a trust tied to Leslie Garland and his late wife Elda Garland, according to property records.\nCompass\u2019 Trevi O\u2019Neill and Nicholas Schneider hold the listing.\nThe four-bedroom, five-bathroom home spans over 4,500 square feet. Rising three stories, highlights of the property include a rooftop deck with a hot tub and garden, plus an elevator and sauna.\n",

The eight-story project will include 226 apartments, 100,000 square feet of office space and 13,000 square feet of retail, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nAs part of its $400 million investment in Fort Worth\u2019s Cultural District, the company also plans to start construction soon on One University, at 3001 Morton Street, which will include 115,000 square feet of offices, 242 apartments and a 176-key Autograph Collection hotel called The Tycoon.\nZach Wiegert, managing principal at Goldenrod, said One University could start about four months behind the Van Zandt. Construction on the Van Zandt should take about 20 months.\n\nFort Worth City Council could provide grants up to $11.17 million for the Van Zandt and up to $19.65 million for One University. Goldenrod would have to complete the Van Zandt and obtain a certificate of occupancy by the end of 2026 and do the same for One University by the end of\u00a0 2027 as part of the deal.\nThe projects are part of a wave of investments coming online in Fort Worth that will amount to more than 400,000 square feet of office space. JP Morgan Chase will\nanchor\na second building in the works at Crescent Fort Worth, and Larkspur Capital and Keystone Group\nplan\nto begin construction on the first phase of an\nestimated\n$1.7 billion mixed-use development beginning next year.\nFort Worth Mayor Mattie Parker said companies like Goldenrod are needed to reinvest in class A offices in the corridor to reinvigorate it. Wiegert said financial sector companies have expressed\ninterest\nin the Van Zandt, and that he expects to make tenant announcements in the coming months.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Remember when general elections in New York City were kind of boring?\nUsually by this time of an election cycle, it is pretty clear who the next mayor will be and what ballot questions will be posed to voters.\nThis year, both are uncertain.\nOf course, as the Democratic nominee, Assembly member Zohran Mamdani seems to be in the best position to become the next mayor, especially because his opponents are expected to split the vote against him. Mayor Eric Adams has shot down\nreports\nthat he may leave the race to take a job with the Trump administration; Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa are staying put.\nAs for the ballot questions, Tuesday is a big day. The Board of Elections is slated to weigh in on the City Council\u2019s\nrequest\nto remove three land use reform questions aimed at speeding up housing approvals and weakening the Council\u2019s veto power over such projects. The Council\nargues\nthat three of the five questions are misleading and should be removed from the ballot. The Charter Revision Commission counters that the questions\u2019 wording is clear and closely follows state election law.\nThe Council\u2019s request has\nraised questions\nabout the board\u2019s authority to reject ballot proposals approved by a Charter Revision Commission. The board\u2019s leadership was skeptical last week that it holds such power, given its traditionally ministerial role in such matters.\nRegardless of where the board lands on this question, whether it decides to reject the questions or approve them, a legal fight is likely on the horizon.\nMeanwhile, Open New York and other housing groups have launched \u201cYes on Affordable Housing,\u201d a political action committee aimed at educating New Yorkers about the ballot questions and urging them to approve the proposals. The PAC is seeking to spend $3 million on the effort, and has already received commitments of $1 million. Its backers include Jamie Rubin, NYCHA chair and chief investment officer at Aligned Climate Capital, and Rachael Bedard, an internist, geriatrician and palliative care physician.\nIn a press release put out by the campaign, City Comptroller Brad Lander, Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso and Queens Borough President Donovan Richards expressed support for the ballot measures.\nAmit Singh Bagga, the campaign\u2019s director, said that housing affordability is what propelled Mamdani to victory in the primary, so he believes New Yorkers are more than ready to discuss ways of tackling the city\u2019s housing crisis. He\u2019s also confident the campaign can cut through messaging against the ballot measures.\n\u201cWe believe that when we are able to reach voters directly, and not refracted through the prism of partisan political hacks, voters will respond in kind,\u201d he said.\n\nOpen New York\u2019s Annemarie Gray believes that the fate of the ballot measures could have national implications, as other jurisdictions watch to see if a blue city can pass such changes. She\u2019s confident that the proposal will ultimately be approved.\n\u201cThey are basic fixes to a broken system that is driving New Yorkers to the brink,\u201d she said.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nThe mayoral candidates have weighed in on the ballot measures to varying degrees. Will they take more direct stances on the questions given the current debate? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Eugene Mulvihill was a penny stock trader before he opened Action Park in New Jersey, per the documentary \u201cClass Action Park.\u201d The Securities and Exchange Commission suspended his company in 1974 due to allegations that the firm sold \u201cworthless stock at fictitious prices and without disclosing that the issuing company was bankrupt,\u201d\nthe New York Times reported at the time\n.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 The Fort Greene Park Conservancy is pushing back against a proposed 72-story building nearby, warning the project could cast disruptive shadows over the park, straining hundreds of new residents and their dogs, according to\nGothamist\n. Developers and housing officials countered that the impact from the increased shade would be small and NYC\u2019s ongoing housing crisis outweighs these concerns.\n\u2014 New York\u2019s casino sweepstakes is nearing its final stretch: The state is set to award three licenses as soon as December, and according to\nPolitico\n, there are three proposals with the best odds. As previously reported, Resorts World in Queens and MGM\u2019s Empire City in Yonkers, both existing racinos, are expected to secure approvals. Politico considers Mets owner Steve Cohen\u2019s $3.9 billion bid, adjacent to Citi Field, as the one with \u201cthe strongest shot,\u201d while Manhattan proposals face a more uphill battle. \u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$11.5 million\nfor 226 West 71st Street. The Upper West Side townhouse is 9,400 square feet.\nThe Corcoran Group\u2019s\nDeanna Kory and Audrey Henderson have the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$43.6 million\nfor a commercial condominium unit at Saks Fifth Avenue, 611 Fifth Avenue in Midtown. Vornado Realty Trust is listed as the buyer of the unit that is reportedly part of a broader\n$218 million sale\nby developer Charles Cohen.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $19.8 million for 55 West Ninth Street in Greenwich Village. The townhouse is 4,700 square feet and listed by\nCompass\u2019\nAlexa Lambert, Marc Achilles and Georgeana Leontiou.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "Leslie Garfield is flexing its townhouse prowess across the pond.\nThe 50-year-old brokerage, known for selling single-family homes, has teamed up with the London-based firm Russell Simpson to expand its reach beyond its core New York City neighborhoods, the company announced this week.\nGarfield was previously partnered with another brokerage in the United Kingdom\u2019s capital, Beauchamp Estates, for about a decade, though the two went their separate ways more than a year ago.\nRichard Pretsfelder, a senior partner with Garfield, said the firm ended its association with Beauchamp because the company was \u201cless of a cultural fit\u201d and described their deal as having \u201crun its course.\u201d\nPretsfelder said the firm has been on the hunt for a new partner since then, adding that it ultimately decided on Russell Simpson due to the company sharing a similar \u201cfamily ethos\u201d and \u201cphilosophical approach\u201c to the business.\nNews of Garfield\u2019s new counterpart comes as Americans have been scooping up premium properties in London, following changes to the nation\u2019s tax laws that sparked a downturn in the residential market. The fallout chilled sales, pushed pricing down and sent the number of available homes on the rise.\n\nAbout\na quarter of the top deals in the city last year\nwent to buyers from the U.S., an increase from 18 percent of sales in 2023, according to data from Beauchamp reported by the Wall Street Journal.\nGarfield joins other brokerages that have made international moves in recent months. Elliman in June announced that it would\nend its 15-year partnership\nwith Knight Frank and instead launch its own global arm, Elliman International, with a focus on selling homes across Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific regions.\nAccess to international markets was also one of the\nkey pieces\nof Compass\u2019 deal to buy @properties, the parent company of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, which marked Compass\u2019 first foray outside the United States.\nRussell Simpson, founded by Alan Russell, is a family-run brokerage, similar to Garfield, which was founded by Leslie Garfield in the 1970s and later purchased by his son, Jed Garfield. Both firms also focus on specific neighborhoods, with Russell Simpson zeroing in on Chelsea, Kensington and Mayfair.\nAmong the London homes already featured on Garfield\u2019s site are a three-bedroom townhouse in Notting Hill asking just under \u00a34 million and a two-bedroom houseboat in Chelsea available for rent asking \u00a38,000 a month.\nThe announcement followed a rebrand of the company\u2019s website and the launch of a\nnew data dashboard\ncalled the Townhouse Index.\n",

        "content": "The Los Angeles Housing Department is preparing to distribute $387 million to developers across the city to build affordable multifamily residences, marking the biggest such allocation of funds from the Housing Department in the agency\u2019s history.\nMost of the funding comes from\nMeasure ULA\n, or the so-called \u201cmansion tax\u201d that charges a transfer tax on all property sales in the city above $5 million,\u00a0 the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n.\nThe pending funding round consists of $316 million from ULA funds and $71 million from state and federal programs. It\u2019s the city\u2019s biggest ULA commitment since the measure took effect in 2023. Since then, the tax has raised more than $784 million, but much of it hasn\u2019t been spent due to concerns that the tax could be overturned in court. The city passed a ULA spending plan of $150 million last year and another $425 million spending plan this July.\nEach round of funding usually receives about 30 to 35 applications from developers, though this round will likely attract more due to the amount of money available. Applications for the notice of funding availability open Friday and close Oct. 20.\nIt\u2019s unclear how many total units of housing might be involved in the projects that get funding, although recent reports indicate development costs of nearly $900,000 per unit for affordable housing in LA. The round of $387 million might make a less-than-significant dent in what\u2019s widely considered a chronic housing shortage in the city, adding 450 or so affordable units.\nNonprofit and for-profit developers, community land trusts, limited equity housing co-cops, public entities and other organizations will have access to the funds. In addition to funding new construction, the money will also support housing preservation and assistance funding operations, according to Housing Department general manager Tiena Johnson Hall told the L.A. Times.\n\nThe $387 million notice of funding availability is a significant jump from the housing project funding distributions typically between $50 million and $75 million. The Housing Department will release new funding on an annual basis moving forward as Measure ULA is a continual source of funds.\nPreviously, the city doled out funds based on the number of units in a project, but now, funding is based on a percentage of development costs. As a result, developers will receive higher awarded amounts than they usually do. The new system allows the city to better determine funding amounts to help developers meet the ballooning costs of development, Johnson Hall said, per the Times.\nUnder the new approach, ULA funds can cover anywhere from 30 percent to 100 percent of costs, depending on the project. Categories include affordable housing construction, affordable housing preservation and construction of adaptive reuse projects.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The price works out to $191 per square foot. The seller was Phoenix-based Western Alliance Bank, which seized it in foreclosure this year.\nThe 10-story building was constructed in 1980 and underwent an $11.5 million renovation in 2018. A joint venture between Ocean West Capital Partners and Rockwood Capital bought it in 2021\nfrom PGIM\nfor $64 million, about $8.3 million less than what PGIM paid for it in 2015.\nThe joint venture secured a $60.6 million loan from Western Alliance Bank to finance the purchase, but defaulted earlier this year on approximately $41.7 million in outstanding debt, Commercial Observer\nreported\n.\nTenants in the building include law firm Winthrop Golubow Hollander, and rubber manufacturer CRM.\n\nSeveral Orange County office properties have traded at steep discounts this year.\nIn July, ParkTerra and Jen Partners paid $62.5 million for the five-building Axis business park in Anaheim. That\u2019s about 25 percent less than what Pendulum Property Partners paid for it in 2018.\nThe month before, Newport Beach-based Surlamer Investments bought the 19-story City Plaza office tower in Orange from TPG Capital for $18.5 million, making it one of the cheapest deals in recent years in Orange County. TPG acquired the 369,000-square-foot City Plaza after Greenlaw Partners and Walton Street Capital\ndefaulted\non $64.2 million of debt at the property.\nThat same month, Anaheim Ducks owners Henry and Susan Samueli bought the 12-story Stadium Tower offices in downtown Anaheim for $72.1 million. CBRE Investment Management and CalSTRS had acquired the 261,900-square-foot property in 2017 for $63.9 million.\nIn March, a mystery buyer\nsnapped up\nthe five-story Plaza Pointe office building in Laguna Hills for $15.5 million \u2014 a sharp drop from its $74.3 million sale price in 2019.

        "content": "As the United Center\u2019s owners gear up to begin construction on its $7 billion redevelopment, the city of Chicago is looking to peak developers\u2019 interest in more than a dozen surrounding vacant lots.\nFour clusters of city-owned land, totaling 19 lots, were opened for requests for proposals in August. They are mostly along West Madison and West Fifth streets near East Garfield Park in the Near West Side, the Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\n. The city is focusing on these\nlots\nas part of a broad push for more West Side\ninfill\n, officials from the Department of Planning and Development told the outlet. The RFP specifically identifies neighborhood amenities, residential and employment opportunities to build momentum off of the 1901 Project, the name of the United Center redevelopment plan.\nDevelopers have until Sept. 30 to submit questions, and proposals are due by the end of October. The city suggested in the RFP that residential proposals should include an element of affordable units that line up with the Affordable Requirements Ordinance, but did not specify an amount per development.\nThree clusters are to the south of United Center along Madison Street. The city identified those lots as best for mixed-use retail and multifamily development. A fourth cluster along the 2900 block of West Fifth Avenue was suggested for residential development in the RFP.\n\nOther pieces of the infill puzzle are coming together in the area.\nEarlier this year, plans for a new CTA Pink Line station near the United Center moved forward, though funding mechanisms still need to be ironed out. The train station,\nproposed\nfor Madison Street, would serve as a crucial addition to the neighborhood\u2019s infrastructure, improving access to one of Chicago\u2019s busiest areas and providing much-needed connectivity for residents, commuters and visitors. The parcels are also near other transit options, including the Damen Green Line L stop. The Illinois Medical District, a major employment hub, is also nearby.\nThe\n1901 Project\nincludes plans to build a 6,000-seat music hall, 1,300 hotel rooms and 9,500 apartments. The mixed-use megadevelopment is being spearheaded by Michael Reinsdorf, owner of the Chicago White Sox and Bulls, and Danny Wirtz, whose family owns the Blackhawks.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Beverly Rawlings, whose late husband pioneered a multibillion-dollar insurance-adjacent industry, sold her oceanfront Palm Beach condo for $17.2 million in an off-market deal.\nIt marks one of the island\u2019s most expensive condo sales ever. Records show Rawlings sold the condo at 102 Gulfstream Road to a Delaware entity named for the address. The true buyer is unknown.\nRawlings\u2019 late husband, George Rawlings, founded the Rawlings Group in 1977, according to his obituary. His methods formed the basis of the multibillion-dollar subrogation outsourcing industry, according to a 2018\nAssociated Press\nprofile that described him as a \u201cbounty hunter\u201d for health insurance companies. Subrogation refers to an insurer\u2019s right to recover money it paid for a loss from the third party that inflicted the loss, such as an at-fault driver.\nThe company is headquartered in La Grange, Kentucky. The couple founded the Crab Orchard polo team, which thrice won the U.S. Open, according to published reports. They have also been significant supporters of the private Christian university, Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, George Rawling\u2019s obituary shows. Rawlings\u2019 father, Dr. John Rawlings, was a friend and adviser to the school\u2019s founder, Dr. Jerry Falwell.\n\nThe Rawlings split their time between the Palm Beach condo and a 180-acre farm in Oldham County, Kentucky, until he died in 2023, according to published reports. Records show in 2016 they sold an equestrian estate in\nWellington\nto former Dodgers owner Frank McCourt for $20 million.\nThey bought the Palm Beach unit for $13.9 million in 2016, property records show. It was built in 2009, and spans 4,900 square feet, with four bedrooms, four bathrooms and two half-bathrooms.\nIt was previously listed asking $19.5 million before Beverly Rawlings pulled the listing in May, Zillow shows.\nThe off-market deal makes it the third-most expensive sale ever in\nPalm Beach\n. The record is held by billionaire Robert Kraft\u2019s\n$23.8 million\npenthouse purchase in 2022. In 2023, car dealer Terry Taylor dropped\n$18 million\non the 9,900-square-foot condo in the Tiffany &amp; Co. building on Worth Avenue.",

Aside from its regional headquarters, Lennox plans to establish a training center at the property, according to a news release from the seller\u2019s broker.\nLennox is led by CEO Alok Maskara.\nThe seller is an entity tied to Health Network One, a network manager for outpatient therapy, routine vision, medical eye care, dermatology and podiatry.\nSteve Hyatt of Berger Commercial Realty represented the seller. Christopher Dubberly and Michael Meaden were part of the CBRE team that represented the buyer.\n\nHealth Network One paid $2.2 million for the property in 2012, according to records. The one-story building was completed in 1949, and Health Network One gut renovated it in 2014, the Berger Commercial release says. The building previously was a distribution center for Hughes Supply Company.\n\u201cWe expected the highest offer to come from a developer,\u201d Hyatt said, adding that the property\u2019s move-in ready condition made it appealing for an end user.\nSouth Florida\u2019s\noffice market\nboomed during the first three years of the pandemic, and has calmed more recently due to elevated interest rates,\nsuppressed values\nand a slower influx of out-of-state companies. Generally, two types of office properties \u2013\u2013 medical offices and user-owned buildings \u2013\u2013 have continued to trade and have remained resilient to a market slowdown, experts have said.\nStill, downtown\nFort Lauderdale\nscored two trophy office tower sales in the first quarter. Bradford Allen Investment Advisors paid\n$208 million\nfor the Las Olas Centre I &amp; II at 350 and 450 East Las Olas Boulevard. Also, Lone Star Funds, through its real estate fund VII, and Highline Real Estate Capital and Square2 Capital bought the 23-story Bank of America Plaza at Las Olas City Centre building at 401 East Las Olas Boulevard for\n$220 million\n.\nAll-cash deals have been more common amid the higher interest rate environment. Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega is under a\n$275 million\ncontract for the 30-story Sabadell Financial Center at 1111 Brickell Avenue in Miami\u2019s Brickell.\n",

The earliest he will be eligible for parole release is November 2026.\nKossoff did not respond to a request for an interview earlier this year, and the criminal defense attorney in his case did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHe\u2019s serving his time at the Groveland Correctional Facility in Soneya, about an hour and a half east of Buffalo. The parole board will have two weeks following the hearing to render a decision.\nKossoff had been a high-powered attorney representing some of the city\u2019s biggest residential landlords. As the head of his firm, Kossoff PLLC, he wielded absolute control over his clients\u2019 escrow funds \u2014 a system that in most law firms has more checks and balances.\nIt turned out that Kossoff was using his clients\u2019 money to pay for things like his credit card bill and apartment. He also had a struggling family business he was trying to keep afloat.\nThen one day in the spring of 2021, Kossoff\nwent AWOL\nafter several clients demanded their escrow money back, and attorneys at his company were left scrambling for answers.\nHe eventually pleaded guilty to four charges of theft and fraud, admitting that he stole nearly $15 million.\n",

        "content": "The real estate industry continues to take sides in the contested mayoral race, leading prominent developers to gather behind closed doors on Tuesday morning.\nRelated Companies\u2019 Jeff Blau and his wife sent an email on Monday evening calling for a gathering at the Seagram Building the next morning, the New York Times\nreported\n. The alert said the recipients \u201cmust act decisively to ensure that the next mayor of New York is Andrew Cuomo.\u201d\nRFR\u2019s Aby Rosen, who owns the Seagram Building, was among the signees for the email. It\u2019s unclear what other developers could be involved in the proceedings, which appear designed to jumpstart a larger effort to keep Zohran Mamdani away from Gracie Mansion.\n\u201cWhile billionaires continue to panic and scheme behind closed doors, our campaign is mobilizing tens of thousands of New Yorkers to get involved in the democratic process and rally around an agenda to make this city affordable,\u201d a spokesperson for the Mamdani campaign told the Times.\nDespite being\nblown out\nby Mamdani in the Democratic primary, Cuomo is emerging as the top choice against the Democratic Socialist as incumbent Eric Adams considers opportunities to suspend his re-election campaign. He has reportedly been approached by the Trump administration, potentially for an ambassadorship to a country in the Middle East. Adams, however, has maintained that he is staying in the race and has had no conversations about a possible new gig.\n\nCuomo will need plenty of support to overcome the scandal-ridden end to his governorship, not to mention an electorate that reliably leans towards the candidate running on the Democratic party line.\nBut while real estate\u2019s heavyweights look for a candidate to coalesce around, industry figures are also gathering around Mamdani, playing the odds of his victory. Kenny Burgos of the New York Apartment Association is directly speaking to Mamdani, he told\nthe Wall Street Journal\n, while MSquared\u2019s Alicia Glen organized a dinner in July to discuss how the housing industry can work with the candidate.\nAffordable housing developers are among those to\nadopt a warming sentiment\ntowards Mamdani, encouraged by a promise to beef up the city\u2019s housing agency and increase capital for housing construction. They stand in sharp contrast to rent-stabilized owners, who live in fear of Mamdani\u2019s pledge to freeze rents for four years.\nAmong those to\ncontribute\nto Mamdani\u2019s campaign are Beachwold Residential CEO Gideon Friedman and Hudson Companies\u2019 Joseph Riggs.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The city\u2019s Board of Elections on Tuesday unanimously approved three ballot measures that would speed up housing construction and weaken the City Council\u2019s veto power over rezonings, likely setting the stage for a legal battle before the general election.\nThe board, after listening to\u00a0six speakers urge the questions\u2019 approval,\u00a0didn\u2019t\u00a0ask any questions and signed off on the proposals. The decision likely means the fight over the ballot measures is heading to the courts, as the City Council has already hinted that it would file a lawsuit once all other avenues to challenge the questions were exhausted.\nA lawsuit could delay printing the ballots for the general election. The deadline for finalizing the ballots is Thursday.\nTypically, the board approves ballot questions without incident. But in a\nletter\nsent to board President Frederic Umane on August 27, City Council leaders\ncalled\non the board to reject three of the five questions, claiming they conceal the consequences of the proposed changes from voters, quietly transferring power away from local Council members.\nThe Charter Revision Commission fired back with its own letter, asserting that the board does not have the\nauthority\nto reject the questions and that courts have consistently ruled that its role is ministerial. Schierenbeck also emphasized that the language of the ballot questions closely adhered to state election law, which sets word count limits for the questions: 15 words for a title, 30 words for a summary of the proposal and another 30 to describe in \u201cplain language\u201d the outcomes of a yes or no vote.\nThree questions\nThe Council viewed the three ballot proposals as a threat to member deference, the longstanding tradition of voting according to the wishes of the local member. The City Council effectively has the final say over projects that go through the city\u2019s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, or Ulurp, a fact that provides members with leverage to negotiate for neighborhood investments, pledges to hire union labor, deeper affordability and other commitments from developers as a condition of approval.\nOne of the questions the Council wanted eliminated asks whether the city should replace the mayoral veto in Ulurp with a three-member appeals board for certain housing projects. The board, consisting of the mayor, City Council speaker and applicable borough president, could only reverse Council decisions on projects that would result in affordable housing in one borough, not citywide land use actions.\nAs the system stands, the mayor rarely vetoes land use actions, given the likelihood that a City Council supermajority would then override the decision. Proponents of this change hope that a developer may be more willing to pursue a project if given hope of winning over the appeals board. Few builders will bother filing a project application if the local Council member has a record of opposing development.\nAnother ballot question asks voters if modest housing and infrastructure projects should go through a quicker review process, dubbed Expedited Land Use Review Procedure, or Elurp,\u00a0 that bypasses City Council or City Planning approval, depending on the project type. The third proposal would fast-track housing (avoiding a Council vote) in the 12 districts that have approved the lowest rates of affordable housing over a five-year period. It would also allow the Board of Standards and Appeals to waive zoning requirements for publicly funded affordable housing projects.\nThe other two\nquestions\n, which the Council has not challenged, ask if local elections should be moved to even years, coinciding with presidential elections, and if the official street map of the city should be digitized and consolidated.\n\nA contested commission\nIn July, the Charter Revision Commission\nvoted\nto put the five questions on the ballot after eight months of public hearings.\nThe City Council saw the commission as an affront to his authority from the start.\nThe commission was the second convened by Mayor Eric Adams, which superseded another commission formed by the City Council. The Council\u2019s commission, dubbed the \u201cCommission to Strengthen Local Democracy,\u201d\nconsidered proposals\nto curb the mayor\u2019s power, including by increasing the Council\u2019s authority to approve or reject mayoral appointees.\nThe mayor\u2019s commission was focused on building on the\nCity of Yes for Housing Opportunity\n, a text amendment that reduced parking requirements for new development in the city, created new district designations that allow for higher residential density and made other changes aimed at making it easier to build housing.\nThe measure was opposed by some Council members and was even the subject of a\nlawsuit\nbrought by Conservative members who argued that the city failed to do a comprehensive environmental review of the potential impacts of the zoning changes.\nThe Council only approved City of Yes after securing a commitment of $5 billion in public funding and making several changes that ultimately reduced housing projections, including maintaining parking minimums in parts of the city and limiting where accessory dwelling units are permitted.\nDuring a City Council hearing hours before the board\u2019s meeting, City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams touted commitments made as part of a proposal to rezone more than 200 blocks within Jamaica, Queens, which she represents. The plan is expected to pave the way for more than 12,000 housing units, and the administration has already committed to a number of community investments, including $300 million for sewer upgrades. Adams alluded to the ballot measure controversy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that none of these investments and community benefits would be possible without the City Council\u2019s direct role within the land use process to negotiate and secure commitments that fulfill community needs,\u201d she said. \u201cNew Yorkers, through their democratically elected representatives, deserve the ability to fight for more affordable housing and neighborhood investments.\u201d\nQuinn Waller contributed reporting.\n",

        "content": "Michael Shvo sold his former Epicure assemblage on Alton Road, where he planned a luxury office and apartment project, to Infinity Collective,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nThe sale comes as Shvo is\nfighting to hold onto control\nof the nearby Raleigh condo and hotel development on Collins Avenue, amid his dispute with Germany\u2019s largest public pension fund, Bayerische Versorgungskammer. BVK backed some of his investments in the U.S., including the Raleigh, but it was not invested in the Alton Road site.\nShvo\u2019s BH The Alton LLC sold the properties at 1656, 1664, 1676 and 1680 Alton Road, and 1677 West Avenue, home to the former site of Epicure Gourmet Market &amp; Caf\u00e9. Shvo had tapped brokers to market the assemblage for sale earlier this year, sources told\nTRD\n.\nNew York-based Infinity, led by Steve Kassin and David Berg, confirmed the purchase in a statement to\nTRD\n.\nShvo\nsecured approval\nfrom the Miami Beach Design Review board in 2023 for The Alton, a planned six-story building with about 17,000 square feet of office space and five apartments on the northwest corner of Alton and Lincoln roads. Foster + Partners and Kobi Karp designed the project.\nNew York-based Shvo said in a statement provided to\nTRD\nthat office development was \u201cno longer the highest and best use for this site.\u201d\n\u201cShvo\u2019s singular focus remains super-prime real estate, and we are pleased that Infinity Collective will move forward with much-needed housing at this location,\u201d the statement from Shvo reads.\nBerg, a partner at Infinity, said the firm will explore \u201calternative mixed-use development options.\u201d\nInfinity\u2019s portfolio in Miami Beach includes the Esme hotel on Espa\u00f1ola Way, the Variety Hotel at 1700 Alton Road and properties on Ocean Drive.\nShvo paid\n$39.3 million\nfor the Alton Road development site in 2022, at the time marking his growing investment and development pipeline in South Beach. That same year, he paid $4.5 million for a portion of the development site for his One Soundscape Park project, the second office building he planned in South Beach, at 1665 and 1667 Washington Avenue\nAt the time, South Florida\u2019s office market boomed, fueled by an influx of out-of-state financial, tech and other companies that leased offices. Rents surpassed $100 per square foot for the first time in the tri-county region. In Miami Beach, the push for more office development also was championed by city officials who wanted to shed South Beach\u2019s party image.\n\nBut as interest rates increased, the pipeline of new-to-market firms slowed and the hype over South Florida\u2019s office market quieted. Questions loomed over the viability of some of the planned office buildings, including Shvo\u2019s two South Beach projects.\nIn a March interview for a story on\ndelayed and canceled office projects\n, Shvo told\nTRD\nthat The Alton and One Soundscape Park were \u201cfull steam ahead.\u201d Construction, he said, was expected to start by the first quarter of next year.\nHe had scored\napprova\nl for the five-story, 62,500-square-foot One Soundscape Park office building last year.\nUnlike the planned office projects in Brickell that are large, The Alton and One Soundscape Park would be smaller and \u201cdemand in Miami Beach is still there,\u201d Shvo said during the March call.\nYet, Shvo was trying to sell The Alton early this year, according to sources. The development site was \u201cquietly\u201d marketed during the first quarter. Brokers in January sent marketing materials to select developers who were asked to sign non-disclosure agreements, one of the sources said. An asking price wasn\u2019t specified, though the source said the whisper among real estate circles was that the price equals the amount of the loan on the site.\nShvo borrowed $28.3 million from an affiliate of New York-based Maxim Capital Group in 2022 when he purchased the property, according to records. Jason Bordenick of Maxim Capital Group declined comment.\nAlso this year, a consultant for Shvo\u2019s German investment partner in The Alton also was marketing the site, the source said, adding that at some point it became \u201cunclear\u201d whether Shvo or his German partner, Deutsche Finance America, had the authority to sell the property.\nDeutsche Finance America co-purchased the property with Shvo in 2022. The firm didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\nShvo\u2019s trophy asset in Miami Beach is the assemblage composed of the former Raleigh, South Seas and Richmond hotels at 1775, 1757 and 1751 Collins Avenue. Shvo announced in 2023 that Rosewood Hotels would brand the luxury condo and hotel project, which is being designed by Peter Marino and Karp. The project includes the restoration and renovation of the historic structures on the 3-acre property and a new, separate 17-story, oceanfront condo tower.\nBut the project has struggled with presales, and earlier this year, Nahla Capital won a bid to take over the development for $275 million. Shvo has the right of first refusal and has been working to try and match the bid, sources said.\n",

The city\u2019s high rent growth and low new supply will likely push those rents ever higher.\nThe most recent apartment tower listings include those in and around the Loop, including Streeterville, River North and Fulton Market. Beyond the urban core of the city, apartment buildings have gone up for sale in suburban Chicago. Some of the properties hitting the market last traded less than two years ago, indicating investors are looking for short-term gains. The city is rated as No. 2 in rent growth among the nation\u2019s largest markets, according to CoStar.\nThe listings could also be a sign that sellers were holding out over high interest rates but have given up on the waiting game.\nDevelopment firm Crescent Heights\nlisted\nthe 398-unit North Water Apartments in Streeterville recently after purchasing the 50-story residential and hotel tower at 340 East North Water Street for $173 million in 2023. Jason Buchberg, vice president of the firm, told the outlet that Chicago is a top performer and that investors are going to get deals where they can get done. Buchberg said the expectations of buyers and sellers are more aligned in the Midwestern markets than in other parts of the nation\n\nChicagoland has the lowest supply growth as a percentage of inventory among major investment markets nationally, according to Newmark.\nRecent listings are testing the theory that rent growth potential can outweigh expensive capital. The Streeter, for instance, is a 49-story, 481-unit property at 345 East Ohio Street that went on the market in August. It was last\nsold\nin 2007 to the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio for $210.\nMultifamily deal volume fell as interest rates ratcheted up through 2022 and 2023. There were $6.3 billion in multifamily sales in 2022; $4 billion in 2023; and $3.9 billion last year, according to CoStar. So far in 2025 there have been $2.7 billion in completed sales, putting the market on track to beat last year\u2019s numbers.\nMuch of the volume this year and last has been suburban apartment buildings, including the E2 complex in Evanston that sold for a\nrecord\n$148 million last year, and the Naperville Fifteen 98 complex that\nsold\nfor $136 million in August.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

At that height, which is 84 percent higher than the city\u2019s height cap, it would become the third-highest building in the Peninsula behind South San Francisco\u2019s 317-foot Genesis North Tower and Foster City\u2019s 305-foot Metro Center Tower, per the Business Times.\nTo make it happen, R&amp;M is seeking waivers utilizing California\u2019s density bonus law to exceed height limits. The firm reportedly told officials it prefers to build larger units of about 1,200 square feet rather than focus on maximizing unit count.\nThe project would help meet a growing need for senior housing in the Bay Area, which is seeing a rapidly aging population compared to the rest of the country. Almost 19 percent of San Mateo County residents are 65 or older, placing it about 2.4 percent above the statewide average, according to the Business Times. In addition, in Redwood City, 5.5 percent of seniors live in poverty.\n\nThe building still needs to clear some obstacles before the project can move forward. All buildings taller than 200 feet must undergo review by the Federal Aviation Administration for potential hazards in the sky. The latest proposal follows an earlier plan from R&amp;M Properties, submitted earlier this year, that would have created an even taller 310-foot-tall structure in downtown Redwood City, though the firm withdrew those plans.\nElsewhere in the Peninsula, another proposed high-rise would set a new record in San Mateo.\nMecah Ventures\nhas filed formal permits to build a 14-store mixed-use tower in downtown San Mateo, which would become the tallest building in the municipality.\nThough the Genesis North Tower in South San Francisco holds the title for the tallest building in San Mateo County, that could be outdone by N17\u2019s proposed 258-foot-tall building as part of its Willow Park mixed-use development in Menlo Park.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Jonas Woods\u2019 Pacific Elm Properties scored a $132.5 million recapitalization for a massive office-to-residential conversion in downtown Dallas.\nCIM Group provided the loan for the 50-story Santander Tower at 1601 Elm Street downtown, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The debt is a win for Pacific Elm, which had a recent\nbrush with foreclosure\non a downtown residential holding and\nlost its stake\nin the Comerica Bank Tower at 1717 Main Street last year.\nThe financing backs the second phase of Pacific Elm\u2019s Peridot Residences, a 396-unit apartment conversion spread across non-contiguous floors of the tower. The first phase\ndelivered 291\nunits last year. The CIM loan will fund the second phase of construction, which will include 105 apartments.\nWhen finished, the building will balance rentals with 858,000 square feet of office space, the two-story Mint House hotel, the private Tower Club and ground-floor retail.\n\nAbout 350,000 square feet of office leases have been signed at the tower since the redevelopment launched. Those include New York-based law firm Wilson Elser, which downsized into 19,000 square feet on the 26th floor late last year. Santander Consumer USA, the auto lender and namesake tenant, occupies more than 200,000 square feet.\nThe project is indicative of Dallas\u2019 wave of adaptive reuse downtown, where some office landlords are racing to meet residential demand. Pacific Elm,\nled\nby Jonas Woods and\nbacked\nby billionaire Tom Dundon, emerged as a central player in that shift. The firm\u2019s holdings include six Class A towers spanning 4.4 million square feet. It also owns Bryan Tower, at 2001 Bryan Street, where it\u2019s planning another office-to-apartment conversion.\nSantander Tower was among North Texas\u2019 largest office properties, with 1.4 million square feet. Its repositioning signals how owners of even the region\u2019s trophy assets are recalibrating toward mixed-use \u2014 a trend reshaping the Dallas skyline as work patterns and tenant priorities evolve.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The deal ranks among the most expensive office transactions in the past year in Los Angeles County.\nThe property spans nearly 42,000 square feet and is occupied by The Gores Group and a members-only social and co-working club.

It will bring about the proposed redevelopment with the support of investors including The Gores Group and Kuwait-based Action Real Estate Company. Corinthia will keep a minority stake through its C-Rev development arm.\n\nMeanwhile, Corinthia is gearing up to transform a set of buildings at Wilshire Boulevard and Spaulding Drive. The lodging group in March\nbought the 44-room Maison 140 hotel and 49-room Mosaic Hotel\n, both adjoining the 9800 Wilshire office building, for $35 million. Maison 140 was built in 1939 as a residence for silent film star Lillian Gish.

Late last year, Corinthia completed a $162 million redevelopment of the Grand Hotel Astoria in Brussels and reopened it as the Corinthia Brussels.

        "content": "President Trump\u2019s planned veteran housing community in West Los Angeles is moving forward under a shroud of secrecy.\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs is purportedly requiring everyone associated with the project\u2019s planning, including employees, contractors and other government officials, to sign nondisclosure agreements, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n. Congressional staffers and veterans and their advocates are reportedly barred from reviewing or commenting on the plan.\nTrump first issued the executive order May 9, giving the VA 120 days to come up with a plan \u201cto\nhouse up to 6,000 homeless veterans\n\u201d by the beginning of 2028 in a so-called National Center for Warrior Independence. The development is planned for the West Los Angeles VA Medical Center campus.\nLast week, Rep. Mark Takano, a ranking member on the House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs, convened a so-called roundtable at Bob Hope Patriotic Hall in downtown Los Angeles to discuss the plan.\n\u201cAlthough I disagree with the president on almost everything, I am as eager as he is to see the Soldiers\u2019 Home become a community for veterans and to see us establish a Center for Warrior Independence in West L.A.,\u201d Takano said.\nThe figure of 6,000 homeless vets is three times greater than the housing currently planned for the 388-acre property, raising questions about what kind of housing is intended for the site, as well as where exactly it would be built, how much it would all cost, and where the funding would come from.\n\nThe VA has included $530 million for construction on the West L.A. campus in its current budget request, though it\u2019s unclear whether that amount will be approved by Congress. So far, the House has passed a nearly $1.8 billion appropriation to fund all construction of VA hospitals, clinics, housing and cemeteries across the country.\nThe VA is required to produce 1,200 units of permanent housing on the site as part of a settlement of a 2011 lawsuit, according to the Times. The VA contracted the work to affordable housing developers, who then secured outside funding through tax credits. Currently, 571 of those units have been completed.\nIt remains to be seen just how many of the details behind Trump\u2019s plan are hammered out in secret.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen over the years how it goes when you have meetings behind closed doors and you don\u2019t consult with people affected by the plan,\u201d Iraq War veteran Rob Reynolds said at the roundtable on the executive order, per the L.A. Times. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be problems with that plan.\u201d\nVA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz, in response to a Times request for comment, said that \u201cthe VA recently announced $818 million in grants to fight veteran homelessness across the country, of which more than $138 million will benefit veterans in California.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi is delivering on his signature promise to make the property tax system fairer, but questions remain about whether his office is getting the numbers right.\nKaegi has \u201cclearly improved\u201d the fairness of assessments over his two terms, reversing the system that for years overvalued working-class homes while giving breaks to the wealthy, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n, citing a study by University of Chicago professor Christopher Berry.\nAbout 70 percent of assessments of homes that fall below the luxury category by Kaegi\u2019s predecessor were trimmed down. Berry\u2019s analysis concluded that for the first time in years, Cook County\u2019s assessments are \u201cwithin industry standards\u201d on fairness.\nDuring the prior tax assessor Joe Berrios\u2019 term, the tax office was taking taxes off the most-valuable properties and putting them on everyone else, Berry found. From 2010 to 2018, assessments shifted $1.9 billion from the upper 30 percent of property owners downward.\nBerry\u2019s study, which focused on homes, smaller apartments and condos, credited Kaegi with virtually eliminating the \u201cRobin Hood in reverse\u201d effect under Berrios.\n\nThe\nfixes\nhave come at a cost. While Kaegi has leveled the playing field among homeowners, residential properties overall are under-assessed compared with actual sales prices. In other words, Kaegi may have made the system more equitable, but less accurate. Homes are supposed to be taxed at 10 percent of market value. Under Kaegi, that figure slipped to 8.2 percent in his second term, down from 8.8 percent under his predecessor.\nThat gap has implications for commercial real estate as well. Cook County\u2019s unpredictable property tax regime is a perennial headache for investors. Commercial assets are supposed to be assessed at 25 percent of market value, a rate that helps make Chicago\u2019s effective tax load among the nation\u2019s highest. Kaegi has\nraised\nvaluations on office towers, hotels and industrial sites, fueling pushback from business groups and contributing to Democratic leaders declining to endorse him for a third term.\nKaegi faces a steep re-election fight. Party officials have\nrallied\nbehind Lyons Township Assessor Pat Hynes, who argues that Kaegi\u2019s office has been plagued by misclassifications and erratic suburban valuations. Kaegi\u2019s political pitch is that he fixed a system long tilted toward the\nwealthy\n. The bigger question for real estate is whether he\u2019s created a system that can be trusted to produce stable, predictable values.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The apartment complex is a traveling housing finance corporation deal where the owner, Los Angeles-based Post Investment Group, partnered with a housing finance corporation in Brownsville to get tax-exempt status for a property in San Antonio.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the passage of HB 21 has emboldened appraisal districts to go after the properties that used this loophole by denying their exemptions before the new law goes into effect in 2027, putting 2025 and 2026 exemptions \u201cin jeopardy.\u201d Specifically, the Bexar Appraisal District required Post Investments Group to submit a renewal request to maintain its exemption and has, so far, failed to make a determination.\nThe lawsuit asks the court to reinstate previously granted tax exemptions and to determine that the law violates the Texas Constitution.\nHB 21 is the result of a campaign to outlaw traveling housing finance corporations.\nThe program, which aims to spur affordable housing, was instead used to buoy multifamily investors staring down the barrel of foreclosure after interest rates raised their debt service payments and historic deliveries depressed rents and cut into their revenues. By partnering with affordable housing entities in far-flung counties,\nthey zeroed their property tax bills\nwhile wiping billions of dollars off property tax rolls in Dallas, Houston and Austin.\nBut the legislation that ended up getting signed was so divisive that it made enemies out of the loudest voices pushing for reform of the program.\nWaterford Property Company\u2019s John Drachman, who raised the alarm about traveling housing finance corporations, called the law \u201canti-Texas,\u201d because it undermines local control and the decisions of local housing authorities.\nMeanwhile, Rep. Gates, who is a multifamily operator in Houston, called the arguments of his detractors \u201cred herrings.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Perko Development and Kolter Urban have a new obstacle in their effort to redevelop a beachfront Tequesta condominium.\nIt marks the latest attempt by neighbors of Beach Sound to block the condo project.\u00a0 The Claridge Jupiter Island Condominium Association filed a petition for writ of certiorari in Palm Beach County Circuit Court against the developers\u2019 PK Beach Sound LLC and Palm Beach County, court records show. The suit, filed Aug. 22,\u00a0 alleges the county improperly approved a waiver requested for the project, and seeks to nullify the decision.\nAttorneys for the county and the developers declined to comment on the suit. An attorney for the Claridge association did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nBeach Sound is a four-story, 12-unit condo, built in 1984, at 19930 Beach Road on Jupiter Island. The developers plan to demolish the existing building and build a new eight-story, 12-unit condo with the same name.\n\nPerko\nis led by Phil Perko, and Delray Beach-based\nKolter\nis helmed by CEO Robert Julien. Earlier this summer, the partners\ndropped $37.6 million\non a condo buyout in West Palm Beach, where they\u2019re planning Flagler House, a waterfront 18-story, 39-unit condo tower.\nThe Jupiter Island project has faced opposition since its inception. Karen and Edward Rado, owners of existing Beach Sound unit 301, have refused to sell their unit to the partners and have a separate lawsuit seeking to overturn the condominium termination filed last year, court records show.\nNeighbors have dubbed the project \u201cthe Beast of Beach Sound.\u201d A website devoted to rallying resistance to the project claims the project as designed would \u201ccast shadows on the Claridge pool, spa, fountains, sunbathing areas,\u201d and lists the Claridge, Carlyle, Ocean Sound, Passages, Landfall and Sea Watch as opposed to the development. Representatives for the Claridge, which is at 19950 Beach Road, and the Carlyle, which is at 19700 Beach Road, also\nspoke against the project at a zoning hearing\nlast year.\n\u201cThe Carlyle plans on putting forth a vigorous opposition to the redevelopment at all stages,\u201d attorney Gerald Collins said on behalf of the condo.\u00a0Perko has other condo projects in the area. The firm partnered with Jeffrey Soffer\u2019s Fontainebleau Development on SeaGlass Jupiter Island at 1500 Beach Road, which completed a\n$168.8 million sellout\nin 2023. Perko is also partnering with Soffer on a planned condo at 250 Beach Road, after finishing\na $100 million buyout\nof the Regency Condominium in 2022.",

        "content": "Foreclosure is underway for the\nJamison Properties\n-owned office building at 811 Wilshire Boulevard, after the landlord defaulted on debt connected to the property and a deal to sell it fell apart.\nJamison had a buyer under contract to sell the property and pay off the loan, and it turned over a deposit to the lender, but the sale was terminated. The lender lawyered up and started foreclosure, according to the servicer\u2019s comments in July and August, via Morningstar Credit. The lender is reviewing a modification proposal to the commercial mortgage-backed securities debt.\nThe debt balance connected to the offices is about $35 million, compared to the original $39 million note that matured and moved to special servicing last year. A notice of default and election to sell under deed trust was recorded early May. The balance amounts to about $103 per square foot.\nIt is unclear who the buyer was, how far along a sale was, and why the deal collapsed. A person familiar with the matter said it was an off-market deal. Jamison did not immediately respond to a request for comment; the special servicer declined to comment.\n\nThe 21-story, 337,000 square-foot office building was\nlisted in July\n, in an offering that included a nearby parking garage. That appears to be around when the earlier deal fell through. CBRE has been marketing the property as a conversion opportunity.\nJamison purchased the building in the early 2000s for $26.5 million. When the loan originated in 2014, the property was valued at $68 million. A decade later, it is worth $40.5 million, according to Morningstar. That is still more than the debt tied to it, which is something in downtown Los Angeles, where many offices are valued or sold for less than their debt.\nConsider the Wedbush Center, which is\nvalued\nat $60.5 million, less than half its $128 million debt, or the Brookfield Properties\u2019 Figueroa office tower, which\nsold\nfor $210 million, less than its $250 million debt, to Uncommon Developers.\u00a0At the end of last year, 811 Wilshire was only 36 percent occupied. In 2015, there was an\nexplosion\nin the basement of the building. Beyond the Financial District, Jamison had $200 million in\ntroubled debt\nas of this summer.\n",

        "content": "A development firm proposes a 230-unit affordable housing complex in Princeton, as project applications continue to flow in south Miami-Dade County.\nMiami-based Paxton Development Group wants to build the Legacy Park project, consisting of a pair of seven-story buildings with 115 units each at 13850 Southwest 248th Street in unincorporated Miami-Dade, according to a filing submitted to the county last week. One of the buildings will include ground-floor retail and the other will be designated for residents who are 55 and older.\nDesigned by Corwil Architects, Legacy Park will have one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments restricted for renters who earn up to 140 percent of the area median income. Miami-Dade\u2019s annual AMI is $87,200, according to the Florida Housing Finance Corporation.\nPaxton, led by Nik Echeverria and Mario Sariol, paid $1 million for the 5.1-acre site consisting of two vacant lots in 2017, records show. It has wanted to develop the site ever since then, tweaking its proposed project multiple times over the past eight years.\nIn 2017, Paxton sought a rezoning that would allow for an up to four-story multifamily project with 156 units designated for households earning up to 140 percent of the AMI, records show. Paxton then proposed five three-story buildings with up to 144 apartments in 2018.\n\nAfter several more tweaks over the years, Paxton in November filed for a pre-application site plan review for an up to seven-story, 259-unit multifamily complex under the\nLive Local Act\n. The state law allows developers to build bigger buildings as long as at least 40 percent of the apartments are for households earning no more than 120 percent of the AMI.\nRecords show that in February, Paxton again tweaked its application, settling on the latest proposal for 230 apartments in two seven-story buildings. The latest filing makes no mention of the Live Local Act, and instead says Legacy Place is now designed in accordance with the Miami-Dade County Workforce Housing Development Program and the Princeton Community Urban Center guidelines. The two programs collectively allow for two bonus stories and 25 percent more density.\nMiami-Dade created the Princeton Community Urban Center over 10 years ago by upzoning an area of the Princeton neighborhood near the busway to incentivize more development. The county also designated similar community urban centers in south Miami-Dade\u2019s Naranja, Goulds and other neighborhoods. Despite the upzonings, the districts remained largely undeveloped for years.\nOver the past five years, developers have seized on\nsouth Miami-Dade\n, including the community urban centers, with project proposals. South Miami-Dade, home to the municipalities of Homestead and Florida City, as well as Naranja,\nPrinceton\n, Goulds, Leisure City and other unincorporated neighborhoods, has a hefty supply of buildable land that sells for less than properties in Miami\u2019s urban core.\nIn Naranja, Alcazar Development Group plans a\n211-unit\nmultifamily complex with 27 units at workforce rents on the southeast corner of Southwest 280th Street/Waldin Drive and Southwest 152nd Avenue.\nIn Princeton, Beacon Hill Property Group plans a\n112-unit\nLive Local Act complex with two three-story buildings at 23815 South Dixie Highway. And Pinnacle proposes a\n110-unit\naffordable apartment building for renters who are at least 55 years old on the southeast corner of South Dixie Highway and Southwest 250th Street.",

But the developer hoped a sign would help attract tenants to the 54-acre mixed-use development in the first place.\nFarmers Branch-based Centurion American, run by\npresident\nand CEO Moayedi, requested permission to install the sign recently, but the council voted to postpone approval indefinitely, with one council member, Jeff Casper, saying the developer \u201csupremely overpromised and underdelivered\u201d on bringing quality retail to the project, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe development already has 138 single-family homes, 198 townhomes and 26,000 square feet of raw retail space.

        "content": "Here\u2019s some bedtime reading for supply skeptics.\nAdding supply brings prices down, yet when a lot of new apartment buildings go up in a neighborhood, the median asking rent for StreetEasy listings goes up. That does not defy the laws of economics. It is simple math: About 70 percent of the new units are market-rate and priced above the median, so the median rises.\nAt the same time, tenants in older, occupied units enjoy\nsmaller increases\nthan usual when they renew leases because their landlords don\u2019t want to lose them to the newer, nicer buildings. Unlike the listings for new units, these renewals are\nnot captured by StreetEasy\n.\nNumerous market reports based on listings, not renewals, are released to the media each month. They showed Jersey City rents, for example,\nsoaring\nas a flood of luxury buildings there started leasing.\nThe danger is that someone will publish a story linking development with rent increases, fueling the\nmyth\nthat adding supply makes housing more expensive.\nUnfortunately,\nCrain\u2019s did that\nlast month in an article about StreetEasy data. \u201cIn the past year, some of the neighborhoods with the biggest boosts in inventory actually also saw double-digit price hikes,\u201d the report read, citing Gowanus and Inwood, which were rezoned at the end of the de Blasio administration.\nThe Real Estate Board of New York and NYU housing economist Sam Chandan were aghast. They dashed off a letter to Crain\u2019s that has yet to be published.\n\u201cA\nsubstantial body\nof long-term\nresearch\ndemonstrates that increased inventory\nmoderates rent\n,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAs StreetEasy\u2019s economist notes in the article, the effects of increased supply on demand \u2014 and the resulting moderation of rent growth \u2014 emerge only over time.\u201d\nLet me clarify that last sentence: Rent growth actually moderates right away, but it\u2019s not evident in quickie reports based on listings, for the reason explained above. Census data, and the sophisticated housing studies that use it, take much longer to come out. They offer a fuller, more accurate picture that includes lease renewals.\nThose analyses all show exactly what you\u2019d expect: Rents rise faster when housing development does not keep pace with demand, and slower when it does.\nThe laws of economics have not changed, folks. They will never change.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nOne Greenpoint rental during the city\u2019s post-Covid comeback vividly\ndemonstrated\nthat when a listing causes people to line up around the block, they\nbid up the price\n. Have you seen any bidding wars lately? Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\n\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Fishers Island, 11 miles northeast of the North Fork\u2019s Orient Point, has\nabout 250\nyear-round residents but several thousand during the summer. It is governed and\npoliced by Southold Town\nand accessible only by ferry or plane. By ferry the trip from Long Island takes two and a half hours and two boat rides \u2014 first to New London, Connecticut, then to the island.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 The state may have spent $1.2 billion on Medicaid for people who do not live in New York, the\nTimes Union\nreported. An audit from the state comptroller\u2019s office found the New York Department of Health may not have thoroughly verified the residency of Medicaid beneficiaries, leading to these payments.\n\u2014 Waymo has invested more than $3 million since 2019 in a lobbying effort to overturn New York state rules banning self-driving cars, according to\nThe City\n. Despite Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 last-minute approval of a limited test of autonomous vehicles, hurdles abound: stalled legislation in Albany and City Hall, strong opposition from taxi and for-hire driver groups, and concerns about safety on the city\u2019s dense streets.\n\u2014 Although President Donald Trump and others have pushed for Mayor Eric Adams and Curtis Sliwa to drop out of the mayor\u2019s race to give former Gov. Andrew Cuomo a better shot of defeating Zohran Mamdani, it will be nearly impossible to remove their names from the ballot after Sept. 11,\nCity and State\nreported. Once the Board of Elections certifies the ballot, candidates are effectively locked in unless they can prove they will no longer live in New York City by Election Day. That means even candidates who suspended their campaigns, such as Jim Walden, will appear on the ballot.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$21 million\nfor an 8,700-square-foot townhouse at 16 East 64th Street in Lenox Hill. Thomas Wexler, Tyler Wexler and Hannah Hebda of Leslie J. Garfield had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$66 million\nfor a 125-unit apartment building at 250 West 85th Street on the Upper West Side.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$18.5 million\nfor a 7,000-square-foot townhouse at 175 Clinton Street in Brooklyn Heights. Paul Johansen with Corcoran has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 36,657-square-foot, six-story, 45-unit apartment project at 212 West 231st Street in Kingsbridge. Panagis Georgopoulos filed the permit on behalf of Galaxy General Contracting Corp.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "Chicago planning officials aren\u2019t on board with a controversial zoning change request for a $149 million Fulton Market apartment tower proposal from developer Domus Group.\nIn a letter to Domus from the Department of Planning and Development obtained by\nThe Real Deal\n, city officials said they wouldn\u2019t support the zoning change but suggested modifications to the proposal that would improve its likelihood of getting approved.\nAt 215 North Racine, Domus was originally planning to build a 75,000-square-foot boutique office building, but\npivoted from that plan earlier this year\nin favor of a 30-story multifamily project. The firm requested a zoning change that would allow the property\u2019s floor-area-ratio to increase to 24 times the size of its lot.\nThe change would allow Domus to build up to 312,000 square feet of building space, which would approximately quadruple the amount of buildable area allowed under the lot\u2019s current zoning.\nReal estate professionals and community members\nexpressed concern\nabout the proposed floor-to-area ratio earlier this summer. The original zoning change request would have granted the property the city\u2019s highest level of density, typically reserved for the Loop and Wacker Drive office towers.\n\u201cWhile we cannot support the proposed -16 base zoning designation, that does not mean we are not supportive of the project,\u201d the Planning Department letter read. \u201cInstead we have explored alternative means by which your client could potentially achieve the requested floor area.\u201d\nCrucially, the department suggested that Domus purchase adjacent properties to expand the development\u2019s total land area. Doing so would allow the developer to build the 347-unit tower with a lower floor-to-area ratio, and lessen the amount Domus would have to pay the city for the extra buildable space. In other words, the building would still be tall but it would not require the high-level zoning change some had feared.\n\u201cThe DPD has been supportive of the overall size and scope of the project, including the unit count,\u201d Domus Group Principal Phillip Ciaccio said. \u201cThey made thoughtful suggestions on how we can further enhance the site with additional contextual open space, and we have incorporated those suggestions into our plan.\u201d\nCiaccio would not comment on whether Domus Group was considering buying additional land surrounding the property.\nPursuing extra density is a costly process that would likely result in millions of dollars in city fees for the developer, especially considering how much extra space it needs compared to the current zoning. At nearby 420 North May Street, Crescent Heights paid $5.3 million to the city density bonus program in 2024 to increase its allowed multifamily development by 200,000 square feet. That project incurred among the heftiest fees in the density bonus program in Chicago last year, public records show.\nOnce defined by mostly three story brick warehouses, many of which have now been converted for office and retail, Fulton Market has drawn attention from highrise apartment developers in recent years. If it had been approved, Domus Group\u2019s zoning request would have been the most intense level of zoning allowed in the neighborhood to date.\n\n\u201cThe zoning is quite a bit higher than anything we\u2019ve seen,\u201d Armando Chacon, a member of the West Central Association, said at a June 4 community meeting about the Domus Group tower. \u201cI like the building, but the angst that I have is what this could mean for the future.\u201d\nAt the time, Alderman Walter Burnett Jr., whose 27th Ward included much of Fulton Market and its surrounding neighborhoods, had not officially weighed in on the matter. But since the community meeting took place, Burnett stepped down from his position ahead of his potential appointment as head of the Chicago Housing Authority. The appointment is still pending due to a procedural issue raised by\nOperating Chairman Matthew Brewer\n.\nBurnett\u2019s son, Walter Redmond Burnett III, was appointed by Mayor Brandon Johnson Sept. 5 to fill the seat. Chicago City Council still has to vote to approve Burnett III as the alderman.\nNow that the seat is no longer vacant, Ciaccio said he will reach out to the alderman about the project. \u201cWe look forward to the opportunity to present to the Plan Commission now that the aldermanic vacancy has been filled,\u201d Ciaccio said. \u201c[Walter] Alderman Burnett [Jr.], who was supportive of the project, was not issuing letters of support during the transition period.\u201d\nWhile the zoning request is being considered, Domus Group is facing a realignment of its own. Its co-founder and brother of Phillip Ciaccio, Steve Ciaccio, stepped down from the group\u2019s day-to-day operations over a year ago due to health issues, Phllip Ciaccio said.\nAt the same time, the two brothers have been facing financial troubles tied to personal real estate investments. Last year, Belmont Bank and Trust sued the Ciaccios and an LLC tied to a property on Fulton Market Street, near the Racine Street development site. The suit was brought against MCXIV Partners LLC for defaulting on a $250,000 loan after missing payments in March through July of 2024. The Ciaccios later agreed to pay the remaining balance and the bank dismissed the lawsuit.\nIn January, New Jersey-based hard money lender Asset Based Lending brought a foreclosure lawsuit against Steven and Phillip Ciaccio and the LLC that owned a small condo building at 1629 Burling Street in Lincoln Park. The lender alleged the LLC had missed monthly payments on a nearly $3 million loan in October and November of 2024.\nThe Ciaccios \u2014 both managers of 1629 Burling LLC \u2014 were guarantors on the Burling Street property\u2019s debt, and the lender sought $2.4 million from them for the loan and attorneys\u2019 fees. But the lender later asked for the Ciaccios to be removed as defendants, which the judge granted.\nIn June, the Ciaccios\u2019 LLC gave up two of the property\u2019s three units to the lender to avoid the foreclosure, records show. They had previously sold one unit to an individual in July 2024 for $799,000.\nA month after the Caccios gave up the Burling Street units, First Eagle Bank brought a foreclosure lawsuit against Steven Ciaccio and Casa Clifton LLC, the entity he used to purchase a small multifamily property at 2026 North Clifton Avenue, also in Lincoln Park. The filing alleges Ciaccio missed payments on a $2 million construction loan tied to the property.\n\u201cIn recent times, Steve Ciaccio has suffered from significant health issues,\u201d Steven Ciaccio\u2019s attorney Troy Sphar previously told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cSince then, he has focused on his health and has thankfully now recovered.\u201d Ciaccio is resolving the issues, with some already settled and others set to be settled soon, Sphar said.\nOf the 215 Racine proposal Phillip Caccio said personal matters will have \u201cno consequence on this project.\u201d",

        "content": "A ranch-like Yorkville estate just listed for nearly $8.5 million, with enough garage space for a fleet of cars.\nThe 10,000-square-foot home nests in the rural outskirts of Chicagoland, about 52 miles southwest of the Loop. The seller is the head of a suburban Cadillac dealership, Frank Laskaris.\u00a0 The brick-and-limestone mansion was built in 1994 and was recently renovated, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. In addition to the eight-car garage attached to the home, at 5021 Minkler Road, a 20-car garage is attached to a six-horse stable. There is also a 3-acre pond, historic barn and a private shooting range on the 36 acre property.\nIt was listed privately with Michael LaFido of LPT Luxe Group. Laskaris, CEO of Cadillac of Naperville, purchased the property, known as the Minkler Estate, in 2018 for $5.5 million, one of the\nhighest-prices\nfor a home sale that year in Chicagoland.\nThe listing mentions an infinity pool, pool house and patio area that creates \u201ca resort-like feel,\u201d along with pickleball and basketball courts and a golf chipping range. The renovations aimed to keep an English manor style and charm, including barn wood ceilings and stone fireplaces, along with a chef\u2019s kitchen with marble countertops. There is a 2,000-square-foot detached casita suitable for guests or house staff.\n\nLaFido\u2019s listing does not provide square footage. Prior listings set the total square footage of the home at 13,740 square feet with six bedrooms and nine bathrooms, but it isn\u2019t clear if that includes the guest house. That square-footage would put the asking price at about $618 per square foot.\nThe agent has notched several high-end suburban deals recently, with the sale of the Barrington Hills estate where the TV show \u201cEmpire\u201d was\nfilmed\nfor $6.5 million in April, and the $7.5 million\nsale\nof a Naperville mansion last year. LaFido was also the listing agent for a French Provincial-style mansion in Wheaton that\nsold\nfor $3.6 million in 2024.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

A purchase and sale agreement has yet to be finalized, and the partners\u2019 plans for the site haven\u2019t been disclosed.\nConstruction on Oceanwide Center started at the end of 2016 with a plan to create two high-rises with offices, condominiums and a high-end hotel. The goal was to wrap up construction in just four years. But the 2 million-square-foot project was left in the hole \u2014 figuratively and literally \u2014 due to Oceanwide Holdings\u2019 financial woes.\nThe taller building was approved for 910 feet, which would\u2019ve been the city\u2019s second-tallest building after Salesforce Tower. The tower would have included 1.2 million square feet of offices and 109 residential units.\nThe smaller tower would\u2019ve risen 600 feet and included 156 residential units and a 169-room Waldorf Astoria hotel. In total, the cost of the development effort was valued at $1.6 billion.\n\nConstruction on the smaller tower came to a halt in 2019 amid rising construction costs and stifled Chinese capital spending. The taller tower was abandoned by the middle of the following year. The project\u2019s general contractors Swinerton and Webcor exited the project in 2020 citing a lack of payment; they sued the developer in hopes of securing more than $100 million in unpaid work claims.\nAn arbitration panel eventually sided with Swinerton and Webcor, awarding a payment of $21 million.

The firm paid $190 million for the 358-unit property. That\u2019s almost $531,000 per unit. The sellers were Blake Griggs Properties and Transit Village Associates, the firms that developed the complex. Construction was completed in 2022.\nThe price was 15.1 percent below Waymark\u2019s estimated value of $223.8 million. The purchase was funded by a $118.5 million loan from CBRE Multifamily Capital; the loan was then transferred to the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae.\nThe apartments were developed as part of a transit-oriented development next to the Walnut Creek BART station. The Bay Area Rapid Transit agency sold the property in 2019 to Blake Griggs and Transit Village Associates for $23.3 million. The developers secured a $127.2 million construction loan to bring the project to life.\nAlmost 600 apartments were originally planned, but a timeline for the next phase of construction hasn\u2019t been disclosed.\nAcacia Capital has purchased multifamily throughout the Bay Area over the past two years.\n\nIn November, the firm paid $184 million for a 304-unit apartment property at\n299 Franklin Street\nin Redwood City. Nuveen, a subsidiary of Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America, was the seller.\nLast July, Acacia bought a 275-unit complex at\n3510 Beacon Avenue\nin downtown Fremont for $126 million. That property was offloaded by Las Vegas-based Fore Property.\nPrior to that, in November 2023, Acacia dropped nearly $62.3 million for\nVilla del Sol\n, a two-building apartment complex in Sunnyvale, from Palo Alto-based Pacific Urban Investors.\nOther\nrecent apartment purchases\nin the East Bay, including Walnut Creek, placed buildings\u2019 values lower than previously estimated. The 78-unit Atrium Downtown sold last month for $31 million, down from the most recently assessed value of $32.1 million. And in Concord, Abacus Capital Group paid $98.3 million for the 259-unit\nPark Central Apartments\n, a nearly 25 percent decrease from its assessed value of $130.5 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Austin\u2019s office sublease market is still loaded, even as availability has ticked down from last year\u2019s peak. Companies across tech, insurance and healthcare are pushing millions of square feet back onto the market, giving tenants bargain options while keeping pressure on landlords.\nRoughly 4.4 million square feet of sublease space is available in the city, down from 4.7 million a year ago, according to CoStar. Seven listings alone account for more than a third of that total, spanning over 1.7 million square feet, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe biggest chunk comes from Meta, which\npre-leased\nthe entirety of Sixth and Guadalupe\u2019s office space in late 2021 but never moved in. The company is marketing about 552,000 square feet after signing PricewaterhouseCoopers and another undisclosed tenant to\npartial\nsubleases.\nThe other major offerings read like a who\u2019s who of corporate retrenchment. State Farm is trying to offload 269,000 square feet at 8900 Amberglen Boulevard, while Superior HealthPlan has 216,000 square feet at 5900 East Ben White Boulevard in Southeast Austin that\u2019s lingered on the market for more than a year.\nAt the Parmer Austin campus, at 13011 McCallen Pass Drive, 3M is seeking takers for a 204,000-square-foot lab-heavy property, while Home Depot is offering nearly 200,000 square feet at its former tech hub, which went remote during the pandemic.\n\nGeneral Motors has 170,000 square feet listed at its Parmer Lane tech center, at 717 East Parmer Lane, and Athenahealth is dangling 112,000 square feet at the redeveloped Seaholm Power Plant, at 800 West Cesar Chavez Street.\nVista Equity Partners is looking to\nsublease\nroughly 40 percent, about 79,500 square feet, of its future headquarters at The Republic, a 48-story office tower under construction at 401 West 4th Street in downtown.\nThe glut means discounted rents for tenants, along with turnkey buildouts and shorter commitments compared with direct deals. But subleases carry risk: if the original tenant walks away when its lease expires, subtenants can find themselves out of luck.\nThe\nscale\nof Austin\u2019s sublease pool underscores the broader slowdown in the city\u2019s office market. Net absorption has stabilized, and construction has cooled, but with big corporate retrenchments, vacancy is elevated. Landlords are competing not just with new supply but also with large, well-located blocks like Meta\u2019s tower, which offer move-in ready space at steep discounts.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

He was born and raised in Iowa.\nHe was found dead at his condo at the Ritz-Carlton Residences, Miami Beach. A cause of death has not been released.\nTansey, a high-performing luxury agent, was close to a number of people in the industry. Jay Parker, CEO of Elliman Florida, and Michael Liebowitz, CEO of Elliman, announced his death in an internal memo.\n\u201cHis warmth, sense of humor, professionalism and genuine care for both clients and colleagues made him a true standout at Douglas Elliman and across our industry,\u201d the email reads.\nTansey closed deals totaling more than $3 billion over the course of his career, and was involved in\nsales\nat the\nRitz-Carlton Residences\n, Miami Beach, as well as the planned Edition Residences in Edgewater. Most recently, he led sales of\nRegency Development Group\n\u2019s La Mar\u00e9 in Bay Harbor Islands and Villa17 in Miami Beach.\nTributes to Tansey poured in after news of his sudden death.\nLiebowitz told\nThe Real Deal\nthat he had known Tansey for 15 years, and that they met when Tansey brokered the sale of Liebowitz\u2019s first Miami house.\n\u201cDarin brought something special to Douglas Elliman that can\u2019t be replaced,\u201d Liebowitz wrote on social media.\n\nParker said he was devastated by Tansey\u2019s death, and referred to him as a brother. \u201cHe was a man of integrity, honor, professionalism, respect, commitment, discipline and tenacity,\u201d he said.\nElliman agent Chris Wands said that Tansey was \u201cthe most selfless person\u201d in the business.\n\u201cHe was one of my best friends. He gave me my first job in real estate. Business-wise, friend-wise, there wasn\u2019t a better person,\u201d Wands said.\nJulian Johnston, a top agent with the Corcoran Group, called him \u201cone of the most honorable guys\u201d he worked with. He met Tansey about 15 years ago when they worked together at Johnston\u2019s former brokerage, Calibre International Realty. Johnston said Tansey \u201creally shined\u201d when he sold the Ritz-Carlton project, a Lionheart Capital development that was completed in 2020.\nBHHS EWM Realty\u2019s Nelson Gonzalez, said Tansey\u2019s death was a \u201cgut punch\u201d to the heart.\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the good guys,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cNobody ever had anything bad to say about him.\u201d\nAshley Holland, his publicist, wrote that he was a \u201crespected force\u201d in the real estate industry.\n\u201cBeyond his remarkable professional accomplishments, Darin will be remembered for his infectious energy, his unwavering loyalty, and the way he made every person feel seen and valued,\u201d she said.\nTansey, born on Feb. 16, 1975, is preceded in death by his parents.

        "content": "When Amazon\u2019s back-to-office mandate turned into a real estate headache, WeWork swooped in.\nThe coworking giant inked\na 259,000-square-foot expansion\nat\n1440 Broadway\n, where it already occupied about 300,000 square feet. It leased the space on Amazon\u2019s behalf.\nThe August deal is one example of WeWork\u2019s occasional role as a real estate middleman, sourcing and structuring large office deals for clients. Rather than squeezing tenants into its existing portfolio, WeWork is increasingly going to market and securing leases or subleases for clients, a source with knowledge of the deals said.\nThe model allows companies to bypass years-long lease negotiations and move into turnkey space in as little as three months, the source said. The short-term deals plug the hole for companies like Amazon as they figure out their post-pandemic office needs, he said.\n\u201cWe have a membership agreement [with Amazon] that has all the terms, conditions and everything else,\u201d WeWork CEO John Santora said in May at\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s New York forum, when asked about the deals. \u201cWe now just have to fill in those blanks in terms of the location and the cost.\u201d\nTiming couldn\u2019t be more critical for Amazon. The company ordered 350,000 corporate employees back to the office five days a week starting last January. But desks, parking spots and meeting rooms were in short supply. In some cities, including New York, Atlanta and Houston, the company was\nforced to delay\nits mandate because there wasn\u2019t enough space to accommodate workers.\nWeWork helped bridge the gap. In November, the coworking firm\nsigned a 304,000-square-foot lease\nat Vornado Realty Trust\u2019s 330 West 34th Street, which it is also operating for Amazon. And in February, WeWork added 112,000 square feet at Brookfield Properties\u2019\n5 Manhattan West\non behalf of Amazon, which already occupied 360,000 square feet in the building.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the coworking deals fit into Amazon\u2019s overall office strategy, or whether the WeWork space is a temporary fix while it builds out more permanent offices. The e-commerce giant also owns the\nLord &amp; Taylor building\nat 424 Fifth Avenue, which it bought from WeWork in 2020 for $1.15 billion and reopened in 2023 to house 2,000 of its employees.\nIn May, the company bought RFR\u2019s\n522 Fifth Avenue\nfor $350 million. And in April, Amazon closed on a\n330,000-square-foot direct lease\nat Property &amp; Building Corp\u2019s 10 Bryant Park. The company did not respond to requests for comment.\n\u201cI think that firms need a piece of the real estate that is flex, a piece of real estate that is probably owned, and then there are the traditional leases,\u201d Santora said in May.\nThe Amazon deals come as WeWork is starting to refocus its business towards cost-conscious growth and partnerships after exiting bankruptcy proceedings in June 2024. While New York remains the center of the Amazon partnership, WeWork has deployed the model in markets like Seattle, Nashville and Silicon Valley. WeWork declined to discuss the financial details of the Amazon deals.\nThe arrangement could be bad news for office landlords who rely on long-term leases for steady income. The lengths of the Amazon leases are not known, but a source familiar with the deals cited terms of two to five years. WeWork\u2019s leases with the landlord or sublandlord expire at the same time as its agreements with Amazon.\nOn the flip side, the deals could provide a quick fix for landlords of older properties like 1440 Broadway, which entered special servicing for the second time this summer and has struggled with occupancy.\n",

        "content": "The CMBS market just hit a grim milestone: distress levels are higher than at any point in history.\nThe commercial mortgage-backed securities distress rate climbed to 11.8 percent in August, according to\nCRED iQ\n, setting a record after topping the previous 11.5 percent peak in January.\nThe uptick marks the second consecutive monthly jump and the third increase in the past four months, underscoring mounting pressure in the securitized debt market as landlords struggle with maturities, occupancy and refinancing.\nCRED iQ\u2019s breakdown shows every key distress metric heading in the wrong direction.\nDelinquencies rose 78 basis points to 9.44 percent, while the special servicing rate hit 10.95 percent, up from 10.33 percent in July. Most troubling, the pile of loans past their maturity date ballooned to $38.8 billion, representing nearly two-thirds of the $61.1 billion pool the firm tracks. Roughly 41 percent of those are non-performing, a sharp climb from just a month earlier.\n\nThe data also points to weakening fundamentals. The share of current loans fell for a third straight month to 13.7 percent, while late but not yet delinquent loans now total $3.8 billion, which was a slight decrease from the previous month.\nIn other words, the pipeline of future distress is filling quickly as owners work to clear existing defaults.\nThe report spotlighted one recent slip: a $61 million loan tied to the Estates at Palm Bay, a 300-unit multifamily property in Florida\u2019s Panhandle. The interest-only loan went 30 days delinquent in August despite occupancy of 88 percent and a debt service coverage ratio above 1.4.\nThe CMBS market remains active, despite red flags hinting at increased distress. CMBS loans from private lenders declined in the second quarter, but a total of\n$59.55 billion in CMBS debt\nwas issued in the first half of the year, a 35 percent year-over-year increase and the largest volume in more than 15 years, according to Trepp.\n",

        "content": "Over the next 10 years, the city expects some 9,500 apartments to be built in Midtown South.\nThe new housing is made possible by the recently approved rezoning of the Manhattan neighborhood, which adds high-density residential districts in an area that was previously zoned for manufacturing use.\nThe 42-block rezoning,\napproved\nthis month by the City Council, marks the first time the city has been able to use its\nnew authority\nto map higher-density residential districts. In some parts of the rezoning area, residential space can have a floor area ratio of 15 or 18, a change made possible by the state budget last year, as well as the\nCity of Yes for Housing Opportunity\n. Residential density was previously capped at an FAR of 12.\nThis rezoning is also the first time the city has implemented Mandatory Inclusionary Housing in Midtown Manhattan. Of the 9,500 apartments estimated, roughly 2,800 would be set aside as affordable.\n\nThe rezoning affects four\nnon-contiguous areas\nof Midtown South, bounded by 40th Street to the north, Fifth Avenue to the east, 23rd Street to the south and Eighth Avenue to the west.\nBefore the City Council signed off on the rezoning, it\nremoved\nthe residential zoning designation from a portion of the northwest quadrant in the Garment District and reduced the residential space permitted in the southeast from an FAR of 18 to 15.\nThe changes shaved 193 housing units off the city\u2019s projections.\nSome felt\nthose estimates were too conservative and didn\u2019t adequately capture the potential housing lost due to the City Council\u2019s carveouts. The chances of a site being redeveloped after a rezoning rely on a number of factors that can\u2019t fully be captured in any housing estimates.\nThe Real Deal\nmapped the 60-plus sites that the Department of City Planning identified as likely to be developed as a result of the rezoning, as well as another seven \u201cpotential sites,\u201d deemed less likely to be developed by 2034. The map will be updated periodically to reflect any sales of sites or permit applications filed with the Department of Buildings for the properties.\n",

        "content": "The former Ritz-Carlton hotel in Battery Park City has a new life.\nScottsdale, Arizona-based Silver Creek Development acquired the lease for the Wagner Hotel, which had been abandoned since Covid amid a brutal, three-year bankruptcy process.\nSilver Creek will bring in a new luxury hotel to Lower Manhattan, ending a dark period for the once-glamorous property.\nThe hotel\u2019s prior owners\nUrban Commons\nand its principals Taylor Woods and Howard Wu amassed millions of dollars in debts, including to its lender, as well as owed on basic expenses such as electric bills. Silver Creek bought the loan in 2022 and sued Urban Commons after the firm allegedly defaulted on its $96 million loan.\nThe hotel, no longer under the Ritz-Carlton brand and dubbed the Wagner Hotel after Urban Commons bought it in 2018, became the least of Woods and Wu\u2019s concerns.\nUrban Commons\u2019 grand plan to revitalize a historic ocean liner in Long Beach, California, flopped, resulting in Woods getting indicted last year for defrauding investors. Its REIT filed for bankruptcy in 2020. Woods and Wu were also accused of misappropriating Paycheck Protection Program funds. A Delaware Judge subsequently labeled the two \u201cfraudsters\u201d in 2021, noting the pair had \u201ca history of wrongful acts and have proven that they are capable of shuffling assets.\u201d\nIn 2022, Urban Commons put the Wagner hotel into bankruptcy protection, halting a foreclosure amid other challenges.\n\nBut Woods and Wu\u2019s ongoing legal troubles came up during the process. A condo board, representing owners of 100 units above the 14-story hotel, had its own issues with the developer, claiming Urban Commons stopped paying its share of the building\u2019s common areas.\nWoods blamed some of the property\u2019s troubles on Ritz-Carlton, alleging the high-end brand mismanaged the hotel. Woods also pointed the finger at Battery Park City Authority, the quasi-government agency that controls the hotel\u2019s ground lease. Woods claimed Battery Park City Authority failed to approve the developer\u2019s plans.\nWoods and Wu were soon removed from controlling the debtor entity during the bankruptcy and replaced by a restructuring officer. Still, the process dragged on for years. Greg Corbin, who now leads Northgate Real Estate Group, was tapped to handle bankruptcy and marketing of the hotel. Silver Creek funded the property during the bankruptcy process.\nSilver Creek, represented by the law firm Herrick Feinstein, was the only bidder and submitted a credit bid of over $78 million. In late August, the U.S. bankruptcy judge finally approved the sale of the hotel lease, confirmed the bankruptcy plan and approved a settlement between Silver Creek, Battery Park City Authority, the hotel union and condo board.\nThe judge also overruled the lone objection from a mechanic\u2019s lienholder, which held up the sale.\nWoods and Wu did not receive any of the proceeds of the bankruptcy sale.\nThey have both been charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission with securities fraud for defrauding two sets of investors in 13 hotels in the U.S, resulting in over $70 million in investor losses. Woods denied most of the allegations. Wu has yet to respond.\n",

        "content": "Meyer Chetrit\nis facing more allegations that he is shielding his assets.\nMaverick Real Estate Partners filed a new lawsuit against the developer,\nwho is part of the influential Chetrit family\n. This time, the lender is alleging that a legal document between Chetrit and business partner Gadi Ben Hamo is a fraudulent attempt to evade a $132 million judgement.\nIt\u2019s one of multiple lawsuits filed by lenders\nattempting to claw back money\nfrom Chetrit. By creating false debts, they allege, Chetrit is removing assets from his name and frustrating attempts to collect their cash.\nThe document at the heart of the most recent allegations claims Chetrit owes his partner a debt. In this case, his interest in four companies.\nLawyers for the plaintiff said the document contains the hallmarks of fraud because it was filed shortly after the judgement and connected to a close business partner.\nBen Hamo said the debt is connected to the property he owned with Meyer Chetrit, 64-11 Queens Boulevard. The two\nbought what was then the Queens Motor Inn\n, known for renting rooms by the hour, for $13.3 million in 2017. Ben Hamo told\nThe Real Deal\nhe has paid the mortgage on the property for seven years in a show of goodwill toward the Chetrit family.\n\u201cThey have no money. They\u2019ve been struggling for five years,\u201d said Ben Hamo. \u201cThey are my partner and they are my family and I\u2019m trying to help him.\u201d\nBen Hamo and Chetrit sold the property last month for $18.8 million, according to\nTraded\n. Ben Hamo said he is planning to file a counterclaim against Maverick and accused Maverick of trying to create chaos so that it may acquire more debt at a discount.\n\u201cIt\u2019s full of shit,\u201d Ben Hamo said. \u201cThis time he\u2019s dealing with an Israeli guy who will teach him a lesson.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for the plaintiff, identified as Penn Hotel Junior, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The $132 million judgement that Maverick is trying to collect arose from Chetrit\u2019s default on loans connected to a Midtown development site where he once planned a hotel. Maverick seized the site in 2023 and a court entered the judgement in June.\nMaverick made\nsimilar allegations\nconcerning another debt, arguing that a document recording a $21 million debt from Chetrit to his late brother\u2019s estate was also an attempt to evade the judgement.\nLast month, Chetrit and the estate agreed to void the legal document recording the debt, called a confession of judgement.\n\u201cThe Estate believes it is in its best interest and the best interests of its beneficiaries not to engage in protracted and expensive litigation concerning the validity of the confession of judgement,\u201d the two wrote in the agreement.\nLast month, Elliott Joffe, a lawyer for Baron Samson who was representing Meyer in the previous Maverick case, said attorneys \u201cdeny in the strongest terms possible any and all allegations of fraud or wrongdoing.\u201d\nIn a separate case, a plaintiff connected to Mack Real Estate Credit Strategies recently argued that voiding the legal documents will not stop Chetrit from shielding his assets from judgement.\n\u201cMeyer can continue to use the underlying debt as a pretext to improperly transfer funds to insiders and/or related entities, hiding his assets from creditors, and improperly rendering himself judgement proof,\u201d the plaintiff wrote in the complaint.\nMack is seeking to collect $220 million from Chetrit connected to five defaults. That case is still pending.\nA representative for Chetrit did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

That would pull the plug on the Chicago White Sox, who along with developer Related Midwest floated the idea of a ballpark on the site.\nThe proposed 22,000-seat stadium from Related Midwest and the city\u2019s Major League Soccer team would anchor a the newly envisioned multi-phased mixed-use district along the Chicago River south of Roosevelt Road, between the South Loop and Chinatown. During a virtual town hall meeting on the proposal held Tuesday, Dowell said she supports the plan, putting the proposal on track for a Sept. 18 Plan Commission vote and, if it moves forward from there, a full City Council vote the following week, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nMansueto, a billionaire, plans to personally\nbankroll\nthe $650 million stadium at the megaproject tract that Related Midwest has tried for years to get off the ground with multiple previous attempts to land major entertainment, commercial and educational institutions that came up short. The Fire\u2019s Soldier Field lease expires this year, though the team plans to extend it to bridge the gap until the new stadium is ready.\nThe open-air soccer stadium, designed by architecture firm Gensler, would give the Fire its own home after years of sharing use of Soldier Field with the Chicago Bears. Related Midwest is planning the rest of The 78 as a mix of office, residential and retail.\n\nIn June, the White Sox suggested it was still an option to build a stadium alongside the Fire, as the soccer stadium would rise on 9 acres at the north end of the site, leaving room for a potential White Sox ballpark to the south. Curt Bailey, president of Related Midwest, said the sole\nfocus\nfor a stadium in The 78 is the Fire stadium during the town hall.\nDowell has made her case before opposing two stadiums at the development site. Whether she seeks to amend the development ordinance to prevent two stadiums remains to be seen.\nWhile the stadium\u2019s construction won\u2019t rely on public funding, it will\nrequire\ntens of millions in city subsidies to cover site infrastructure like utility hookups, road upgrades, a crumbling seawall and a stretch of the Chicago Riverwalk. The details of the site\u2019s redevelopment agreement are still being negotiated. The original 2019 agreement called for $551 million in infrastructure projects that Related Midwest would finance up front and be reimbursed for through tax-increment financing dollars generated on site.\nThrough his private investment in the stadium, Mansueto, the Morningstar Credit founder who bought the team in 2019, became the anchor Bailey was looking for after cycling through multiple failed proposals, including Amazon\u2019s HQ2, a publicly-funded White Sox ballpark, a Bears stadium and the University of Illinois\u2019 previously planned Discovery Partners Institute.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The price works out to about $666 per square foot.\nNvidia occupied the building prior to the purchase. It\u2019s the latest transfer of properties between Nvidia and Sobrato at the site.\nThe chipmaker purchased the three other buildings in the office complex from Sobrato in May for $254 million. That places the values of 2711, 2721 and 2731 San Tomas Expressway at about $84.8 million per building, with each structure spanning 125,000 square feet.\nAll four buildings are near its headquarters at 2788 San Tomas Expressway, connected by a pedestrian bridge over the street. The company\nbought its headquarters\nlast year for $374 million.\n\nThe multi-trillion-dollar company is gearing up to invest even more in its headquarters and the surrounding area. Earlier this year, the company filed plans to build a 324,000-square-foot office building to expand its headquarters.\nIn May, Nvidia\nbought a 10-building\n, 13-acre office and research campus at 2348 and 2350 Walsh Avenue, across the street to the south of its headquarters, for $123 million. In July, it snapped up another property, at 2740 Scott Boulevard, adjacent to the four-building office complex, for $4.5 million.\nNvidia isn\u2019t chained to Santa Clara for its Bay Area operations. The company has reportedly been working to create a 30,000-square-foot sales\noffice in San Francisco\n, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\nlast month. The chipmaker was reportedly nearing a lease deal for 45,000 square feet in an eight-story office building at\nMission Rock\n, the forthcoming mixed-use development from Tishman Speyer and the San Francisco Giants near Oracle Park.\nNvidia\u2019s market cap is more than $4.3 trillion, per\nCNBC\n, making it the world\u2019s most valuable company ahead of other tech giants like Microsoft, Apple and Amazon.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The Cottonwood Group raised a ten-figure sum for a fund that aims to capitalize on the current high-interest, distress-filled loan market.\nThe Los Angeles-based private equity shop raised double its original $500 million target, hitting a $1 billion close, Bloomberg\nreported\n. The fund, earmarked for what it describes as special situations, focuses on new developments as well as those that need restructuring. About $300 million is already at work, largely through loans structured with options to take over properties in default scenarios.\nCottonwood said the vehicle has delivered a 20 percent internal rate of return so far. The initial close was in 2023.\nFounder and chief executive officer Alexander Shing told the publication the strategy is built for this cycle. Roughly $2 trillion of commercial real estate debt will need refinancing by 2027, including nearly $600 billion flagged as potentially troubled, per data from Newmark. Higher borrowing costs and sliding property values since 2022 have only added pressure.\n\u201cWe\u2019re two years into a high-rate environment and there\u2019s a lot of stress and distress out there,\u201d Shing said.\nCottonwood\u2019s strategic fund has already placed bets in multiple markets. That includes a residential tower rising at 262 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, where pricing and a sales launch have stalled.\n\nIn June, Cottonwood\nbought out Madison Realty Capital\non its $90 million note secured by the building\u2019s condo units, according to public records. In addition to its original $90 million construction loan, Madison Realty provided $20 million in mezzanine debt and $20 million in senior debt, which was paid down in 2024. Cottonwood provided the extra $50 million in mezzanine debt.\nFor the fund, there\u2019s also a mixed-use development in Austin and the redevelopment of the\nsite of the Viper Room\n, the West Hollywood nightclub with a colorful history. The firm is also in talks over a $240 million construction loan it extended two years ago for the St. Regis Residences in Boston.\nTaiwan\u2019s Fubon Financial Holding, Korea Investment Holdings and the North Atlantic States Carpenters Benefit Funds are among the fund\u2019s investors. Capital came through both the main fund and separately managed accounts.\nCottonwood manages roughly $1.5 billion across its funds, or $2.65 billion including separately managed accounts and other vehicles. Since launching in 2012, the firm has transacted and advised on some $7 billion worth of deals.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Developer Zachary Vella paid off an investor and is now moving forward with plans to build a waterfront mansion on the Venetian Islands,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nVella was in litigation brought by the former investor, Charles Holzer\u2019s Worth Capital Holdings 70 LLC, and paid him off via a recorded sale of the property at 228 and 302 West Dilido Drive in Miami Beach, according to Vella and public records. The deed was recorded for $17.8 million.\nA Delaware entity managed by attorney John L. Penson of Miami Beach-based Asset Recovery Services is listed as the buyer. Vella said he is the true buyer.\n\u201cWe paid [Holzer] back and cleaned up the structure,\u201d Vella said. \u201cWe\u2019re developing the project and moving forward.\u201d\nA Vella-led LLC\npaid $15.2 million\nfor the property, where he planned to build his family home, in 2020. It hit the market in February for $28 million and the price was most recently reduced to $25 million. Vella is founder of the West Hollywood, California and New York-based Vella Group.\nHe said the property hit the market because he had not yet decided what he would do with the land. It\u2019s approved for an 11,000-square-foot mansion designed by Saota, according to the listing. The\nVenetian Islands\ndouble lot was on the market with Dora Puig of Luxe Living Realty.\nThe site includes 120 feet of water frontage with views of downtown Miami.\n\nVella said he\u2019s pulling permits for the property now and will begin work on completing the seawall this week.\nIn early 2024, Holzer\u2019s company secured a judgment against Vella and other entities, including the entity that sold the Venetian Islands property, New York court filings show. The litigation centered around a $2.5 million loan Holzer provided to them in 2023.\nIn 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Holzer and another person with insider trading. The SEC alleged that they traded options in Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. based on information, ahead of an announcement that it agreed to be acquired. The SEC also alleged that they tipped off two other traders before the announcement. In 2023, Holzer was ordered to pay a civil penalty of $1.2 million and was barred from violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act.\nVella is a partner in Bob Zangrillo\u2019s\nMagic City Innovation District,\na large-scale, phased project planned in Miami\u2019s Little Haiti. Zangrillo lives on the Venetian Islands\u2019 Di Lido Island.\nBefore Vella, the Venetian Islands property\u2019s previous owner was Lionel Masson, the founder and former CEO of Pharmacies Lafayette, a pharmacy chain in France.\nThis summer, tech moguls Tom and Patricia Kennedy sold their waterfront San Marino Drive mansion\nfor $46 million\n, making it the most expensive home ever sold in the Venetian Islands.\n",

        "content": "Sotheby\u2019s agent Tonya Li has been working with Chinese clients in Austin for almost a decade. A new Texas law banning certain foreign buyers from owning real estate has dealt her business a serious blow.\n\u201cI lost pretty much 50 percent of my work due to this,\u201d Li said.\nAside from citizens and lawful permanent residents, people and companies from countries designated to be a \u201cthreat\u201d to the U.S. are forbidden from buying real estate in Texas by\nSenate Bill 17\n, which took effect Sept. 1. The law specifically names China, Russia, Iran and North Korea as threats to national security, but any country so designated by the governor of Texas or the Director of National Intelligence would fall under the law as well.\nThe law has chilled foreign purchases that it doesn\u2019t outlaw, Li said.\nLi gets a lot of business from parents of college students, especially the University of Texas, where Chinese students are the largest group of international enrollees.\n\u201cParents are buying the properties as future assets for their children who actually go to school in the United States,\u201d Li said. \u201cNone of my clients are close to national security.\u201d\nMost on-market residential purchases by foreign buyers are detached single-family homes, and half of foreign buyers intend to use their property as their primary residence, according to Texas Realtors.\nAlthough the law permits lawful residents and citizens from China to buy land, it\u2019s shocked the submarket of Chinese buyers in general, said Li, who formerly worked as a manager at a development company in China and has been with Sotheby\u2019s since 2021.\n\u201cTo a lot of them, it is a sign that tells them that the Texas government does not like foreign investors,\u201d Li said. \u201cThey\u2019re panicking.\u201d\nMany Chinese owners have been selling property since the law was passed..\n\u201cThey are worried about \u2014 what if, two years later, there is going to be a new law coming out?\u201d Li said. \u201cI\u2019ve been telling them, there\u2019s no such thing just yet.\u201d\nCRE brokers also reported that Chinese clients\ngrew wary of investing\nahead of the law\u2019s effective date.\nChina was the top country in the United States for foreign purchasers between April 2024 and March 2025, with Chinese buyers making up 15 percent of the foreign buyer market and accounting for $13.7 billion of value. Almost a third of foreign buyers in Texas during that period were from Mexico, but China tied with Canada for second place, with each country accounting for 8 percent of all foreign buyers this year, according to Texas Realtors.\nChinese investors also own more agricultural property in Texas than the other countries named in the bill, according to the\nUSDA\n. As of 2023, the most recent year of available data, 35 parcels over 150,000 acres were owned by Chinese people or companies; Iranian entities owned two parcels totaling 200 acres. Neither North Korean nor Russian entities have reported any holdings to the USDA.\nSB 17 is only the latest Texas legislation stimulated by concerns over Chinese-owned farmland.\nBills to limit land ownership for residents or organizations of China and its allies gained momentum after 2020 with reports on\nSun Guangxin\n, a Chinese businessman who owns about 140,000 acres of land near Laughlin Air Force Base in Val Verde County, in South Texas.\n\nGuangxin planned to build a wind farm that would take up about 15,000 acres of his holdings. In response, Texas passed a law called the Lone Star Infrastructure Protection Act, intended to block businesses associated with China, Russia, North Korea and Iran from accessing the Texas electricity grid and other \u201ccritical infrastructure.\u201d\nReal estate attorney Dallas Barrington has led efforts to stop Guangxin\u2019s development. Barrington represented local landowners in a lawsuit against the agency that manages Texas\u2019 power grid, ERCOT, after it allowed Guangxin\u2019s project to proceed for a time. Meanwhile, Guangxin\u2019s energy subsidiary, GH America, is suing ERCOT in federal court for eventually enforcing the Lone Star Infrastructure Protection Act, claiming it\u2019s unconstitutional.\nGuangxin is selling his holdings \u2014 which account for almost all of the agricultural land recorded under Chinese ownership by the USDA \u2014 suggesting that he isn\u2019t optimistic about the future of his business in Texas.\n\u201cHe\u2019s got all of his stuff up for sale currently, every damn bit of it. And everybody I\u2019ve talked to says he wants out. And, God bless, we all need to help him get out,\u201d Barrington said.\nThe agent selling the biggest of his properties, an 88,000-acre ranch, declined to comment.\nBarrington considers the national security benefits of SB 17 worth whatever its economic cost may be, adding that \u201cit\u2019s not a NIMBY bill.\u201d\nHowever, the law could be difficult to enforce, according to the Texas Real Estate Research Center.\nSome countries, including China, monitor and restrict foreign ownership, but American deed records have limited information.\nIn Texas, county deed registries record private contracts, which don\u2019t show owners\u2019 country of origin or immigration status. Indirect ownership by LLCs or other entities, which can register an address far from the headquarters of their parent company, further obscures the national origin of property ownership.\n\u201cDeed documents are registered with counties, but counties don\u2019t control property titles. They merely register the documents that evidence property title,\u201d TRERC research data scientist Gerald Klassen told a Texas House committee last year.\nAs a result, Texas has no systematic method of determining the nationality of property owners, Klassen said.\nSB 17 threatens rigorous penalties for offenders. Illegitimate purchases are to be sold, and the purchaser will only get the proceeds left over after the state recoups the cost of enforcing the law. Individuals who violate the law could be charged with a state jail felony.\nHowever, since the state doesn\u2019t record the national origin of property owners, the law tasks the\nattorney general\nwith finding and investigating illegal purchases.\nThe Office of the Attorney General did not respond for comment, and it hasn\u2019t publicly said whether it is creating a process to initiate these investigations.\nAbout 78,000 foreign buyers purchased residential property in the United States between April 2024 and March 2025, according to the National Association of Realtors. Texas accounted for 10 percent of those buyers, ranking third behind California, which netted 15 percent of foreign buyers, and Florida, where 21 percent of foreign purchases took place.\n",

        "content": "A top broker in New York City known for his dealings in Downtown Manhattan has executed a deal of his own.\nClayton Orrigo, co-founder of Compass\u2019 Hudson Advisory Team, paid $6.5 million, or $3,400 per square foot, for a three-bedroom condo at 160 Leroy Street, according to public records.\nUnit 5A-N previously traded for $6.2 million in 2021. The home spans more than 2,000 square feet and has three bathrooms, 11-foot floor-to-ceiling windows and a windowed bathroom in the primary suite.\nOrrigo\u2019s team, which he launched with Stephen Ferrara in 2017, is headquartered in the building\u2019s retail space.\n\u201cIf I can\u2019t control the workload, I can control the commute,\u201d Orrigo said of his latest purchase. He added that he\u2019s \u201cbullish\u201d on the Hudson River-side condo, pointing to a recent $25 million deal he did for a 14th-floor apartment.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Arlene Gutterson had the listing.\n\nElsewhere in the West Village, Orrigo appears to have recently traded a co-op at 256 West 10th Street. He bought the apartment in 2017 for $2.1 million and embarked on\na gut renovation\nfeatured in Architectural Digest.\nTwo years earlier, he picked up a one-bedroom at 25 Fifth Avenue in Greenwich Village for $1.4 million, which he offloaded for $1.8 million in 2019.\nThree floors above Orrigo\u2019s new unit is a condo that just snagged a\nrecord rental deal\nfor the building at $40,000 a month, or $234 per square foot. The lease for the apartment, which sold for $7 million just two months ago, was signed by an executive at Michael Rubin\u2019s sports platform, Fanatics.\nHotelier Ian Schrager, Ares Management, Weinberg Properties and William Gotlieb Real Estate developed the 157-unit condominium, which launched sales in 2016. Since then, buyers at the building have included Rubin, who bought a penthouse for $44 million, and Jennifer Stengaard Gross, daughter of Pimco founder Bill Gross, who paid\n$28 million\nfor a penthouse.\nThe building is located blocks from KITH Ivy, a controversial\nnew private padel club at 120 Leroy\n. The club, backed by streetwear designer Ronnie Fieg, Midtown Equities and the owners of Cafe Mogador, just announced it would house the\ncity\u2019s first Erewhon\n, albeit a pared-down version of the Los Angeles grocery store.\nOrrigo and Ferrara\u2019s Hudson Advisory Team placed first among the city\u2019s top resale agents with $366 million in sell-side deal volume, according to\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nlatest ranking\n. The cohort also landed among the top 10 new development agents with $119 million in sales.\n",

The city of Parkland sold the property to Toll Brothers.\nThe sale breaks down to $933,461 per acre.\nSaltgrass at Heron Bay will consist of four-bedroom and five-bedroom homes, ranging from 2,632 square feet to more than 4,000 square feet, Toll Brothers\u2019 website for the project shows. Ground-up construction and presales haven\u2019t started. Homes will have three-car and four-car garages.\nAsking prices are expected to start at $1.6 million, the website shows.\nLed by CEO Douglas C. Yearley Jr., Toll Brothers won a 2023 city solicitation for homebuilders to redevelop the Heron Bay Golf Course.\nAfter the 223-acre golf course closed in 2019, the North Springs Improvement District purchased it for $32 million in 2021, according to records and the city of Parkland\u2019s website.\n\nThe district, which provides water treatment and management to the cities of Parkland and Coral Springs, retained 150 acres for stormwater management and open space, and another portion was designated for a memorial for the 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting.\nParkland purchased the balance of the site for $25.4 million in 2023 and solicited offers for redevelopment, the city\u2019s website shows. Toll Brothers beat\n10 other developers\nto purchase the 21-acre portion of the golf course, including second-ranked K. Hovnanian Homes and third-ranked Mattamy Homes.\nToll Brothers\n, founded in 1967 in Philadelphia by brothers Bruce E. Toll and the late Robert I. Toll, is a luxury homebuilder that also develops apartments, according to its website.\nFor years, homebuilders have\nseized\non South Florida\ngolf courses\nas development sites. The large swatches of greens and fairways are one solution to the tri-county\u2019s limited supply of buildable land due to constraints by the Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Everglades to the west.\nLast year, Miami-based Lennar and the Toledano family\u2019s Aventura-based BH Group launched sales of a\n103 single-family home community\nthey plan on a shuttered 104.3-acre golf course at 19650 Presidential Way near Aventura.\nMiami-based 13th Floor Homes plans a\n335 single-family home community\non the closed Woodlands Country Club at 4600 Woodlands Boulevard in Tamarac.\n",

        "content": "Downtown San Antonio\u2019s office market may be in for a lift as Project Marvel \u2014 the planned $4 billion redevelopment anchored by a Spurs basketball arena and entertainment district \u2014 gains traction.\nWith central business district office vacancies hovering near 27 percent, according to CBRE, brokers said the buzz around\nMarvel\nis sparking fresh conversations with tenants, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n. While departures from heavyweights like USAA, Visionworks and PricewaterhouseCoopers left a glut of space, inquiries are picking up.\nAmegy Bank\u2019s recent 44,000-square-foot lease at 300 Convent was one of the few notable wins, but brokers say smaller deals in the 5,000- to 20,000-square-foot range could follow if momentum builds.\nJoe Bright, senior vice president at Partners Real Estate, told the outlet that more corporate tenants are requesting tours and surveys downtown, even if many stop short of signing.\n\u201cIt seems like there\u2019s still a little bit of a hangup in the execution,\u201d he said, pointing to parking and traffic perceptions as persistent hurdles. Bright believes tangible progress on Marvel construction will be the tipping point: \u201cOnce you start to see dirt moving \u2026 then it\u2019ll switch.\u201d\n\nOn the investment side, John Taylor, CBRE\u2019s senior vice president in San Antonio, said downtown is starting to look more attractive to buyers hunting for a bargain.\n\u201cI\u2019ve actually received questions from a handful of clients saying, \u2018Where are some really nice quality buildings for reasonable or aggressive economics right now?\u2019\u201d Taylor said, adding that the answer increasingly points downtown.\nThe projects\u2019 potential aligns with a broader trend of repositioning central business districts into mixed-use neighborhoods rather than strictly office corridors. But with leasing demand still fragile and execution risk high, it\u2019s unclear whether Project Marvel\u2019s momentum can bridge San Antonio\u2019s vacancy gap.\nIf the buzz translates into leases, downtown could shift to a growth story. But for now, the market is watching and waiting for cranes to rise in the skyline.\nThe county\u2019s\nfunding\npiece for Project Marvel was sent to voters to\ndecide\nthis November by the Bexar County Commissioners Court in August, and while the San Antonio City Council voted recently to continue negotiations with Spurs Sports and Entertainment on a term sheet, it is\nunclear\nif Mayor Gina Ortiz Jones will continue to push back on the development.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Despite hints that the City Council would take its fight against housing ballot measures to the courts, City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams says the next phase will be a war of words.\nAdams on Wednesday said the Council will turn its attention to educating the public on three ballot questions it believes are misleading.\nThe Council had urged the city\u2019s Board of Elections to remove the questions from the ballot, arguing that the trio concealed from voters that power would be taken away from their elected officials on certain land use matters. The board overwhelmingly\napproved\nthe measures on Tuesday, along with two other questions that were not targeted by the Council.\nThough an attorney for the Council\nindicated last week\nthat the Council wasn\u2019t shy about suing the administration, Adams said Wednesday that it will instead focus on an \u201cintentional campaign\u201d to inform voters on the measures\u2019 consequences.\n\u201cWe were hoping that the BOE would see our side of it,\u201d she said when asked by a reporter about filing a lawsuit.\nAdams began Wednesday\u2019s press conference by defending the Council\u2019s reputation, calling claims that the Council isn\u2019t pro-housing \u201cpreposterous.\u201d She said it is \u201ccompletely dishonest\u201d to characterize the Council\u2019s land use powers as the biggest obstacle to housing production, noting that her guiding mantra has been: \u201cWe cannot be the Council that says no to housing.\u201d\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Mayor Eric Adams said the Council \u201cwill now be remembered for trying to block voters from having a say in eliminating New York City\u2019s barriers to housing and bringing down the cost of rent.\u201d\nThe speaker repeatedly took shots at the mayor during the press conference, which preceded the Council\u2019s planned override of three bills the mayor vetoed.\nShe said the mayor \u2014\u00a0who has repeatedly bragged that he led the most pro-housing administration in the city\u2019s history \u2014\u00a0has been taking credit for the Council\u2019s work getting major rezonings and housing projects across the finish line. She touted the promise of a $5 billion investment ahead of the approval of the\nCity of Yes for Housing Opportunity\n, saying the commitment wouldn\u2019t have happened without the Council (housing projections were also reduced as a result of changes sought by the Council).\n\u201cThis Council is doing the work. Not just talking about it,\u201d she said.\n\nThough the fight over these measures has, at times, become personal, the changes proposed would affect mayoral administrations and Councils beyond the officials now in office.\nOne of the three questions that the Council objects to asks whether the city should create a fast-track approval process for modest housing and infrastructure projects that bypasses either City Council or City Planning approval, depending on the project type. Another asks voters if the mayoral veto in the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, or Ulurp, should be replaced by a three-member appeals board for certain projects. The third proposal takes aim at districts that have approved the least amount of affordable housing. Affordable housing projects in those districts would undergo a shorter review process, bypassing Council review.\nThe speaker said the Council\u2019s opposition to the questions is not about losing the power to block housing or even member deference, the Council\u2019s tradition of voting according to the local Council member\u2019s position on land use actions. She noted that the Council has, at times, defied member deference \u2014\u00a0though it remains a rare occurrence.\nThe Council, she went on, uses its authority to demand deeper affordability and neighborhood investments.\n\u201cDevelopers do not automatically produce housing that is affordable to New Yorkers without being pushed to do so,\u201d she said. \u201cThe city often fails to invest in our communities unless pushed to do so by the Council.\u201d\nIf Wednesday\u2019s press conference is any indication, the Council\u2019s campaign around the ballot question will emphasize the potential of the mayor being handed more power, while\nunderscoring ties between the mayor and the Trump administration.\nProponents of the ballot questions, including Open New York and other housing groups, have\nlaunched their own campaign\n, aiming to spend $3 million on promoting the changes.\n\u201cThe actual questions on the ballot still maintain community input and Council members\u2019 authority when they are really trying to build more housing in their neighborhoods,\u201d Annemarie Gray, executive director of Open New York, said after the Board of Elections\u2019 vote. \u201cThese are very thoughtfully designed measures, to really target the worst actors and actually finally make a dent in our cost-of-living crisis.\u201d\n",

The properties are more than 98 percent leased and include nearly 28,000 square feet of retail space, which is fully occupied.\nApartments in the developments range from studios to three-bedrooms, decked out with in-unit laundry, hardwood floors and skyline views. Shared amenities include a pool, rooftop deck, basketball court, gym and 24-hour concierge.\n\nThe deal extends Ironstate and Panepinto\u2019s long-running bet on Jersey City\u2019s transformation into a bona fide alternative to Manhattan living. Jersey City\u2019s Class A multifamily market has posted steady rent growth in recent years, targeting a growing wave of renters increasingly priced out of both Brooklyn and downtown Manhattan.\n\u201cThis transaction underscores Truist\u2019s commitment to long-term relationships with premier real estate investors in the Northeast,\u201d Rebecca Cox, a senior vice president at the bank, said in a statement.\nJLL\u2019s debt advisory team, including Thomas Didio, Thomas Didio Jr. and Gerard Quinn, represented the borrowers.\nA couple of years ago, Panepinto received a\n$193 million non-recourse loan\nfor the construction of Pathside, a 605-unit luxury development at 499-507 Summit Avenue in Jersey City.\nElsewhere in Jersey City, Tishman Speyer\nscored a $331 million loan\nfor 50 Hudson Street in the spring.

The deal has yet to register in public records and the buyer is unknown.\nJill Eber with the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker Realty represented both the buyer and the seller in the deal.\nWallack founded\nMango\u2019s Tropical Caf\u00e9\nin 1991, and it has been a mainstay in Miami Beach\u2019s nightlife since then. He opened an Orlando restaurant in 2014, according to Mango\u2019s website. He also owns a 14.4-acre estate in unincorporated Miami-Dade County.

        "content": "Blackstone bought the 352-key East Miami hotel at Brickell City Centre.\nFunds affiliated with New York-based Blackstone bought the 40-story hotel at 788 Brickell Plaza in Miami from funds managed by Honolulu, Hawaii-based Trinity Investments and New York-based Certares, according to the sellers\u2019 news release. The price wasn\u2019t disclosed.\nEast Miami is home to rooftop venue Sugar and also has 89 serviced apartments.\nThe sale marks the second time the hotel has traded in the past four years. In 2021, Trinity and Certares bought East Miami for\n$174 million\nfrom the developer, Swire Properties. Deeds recorded for that sale show the price was $120.3 million, but the larger price reported by media outlets likely is due to the addition of furniture and fixtures.\nMiami-based Swire, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based Swire Properties, completed East Miami in 2016 as part of the\nBrickell City Centre\nmixed-use complex that spans about five city blocks. Aside from the hotel, the complex consists of about 500,000 square feet of retail; the 43-story Reach and Rise condo buildings; and a pair of office buildings.\nBlackstone, an alternative asset management giant led by CEO Stephen A. Schwarzman, had about $1.2 trillion in assets under management at the end of the second quarter, according to its website.\nThe firm has been active in South Florida, including selling off industrial properties in recent years. In June, the firm and its industrial properties arm, Link Logistics, sold a 43.7-acre development site planned for offices and warehouses at 12691 Northwest LeJeune Road in Opa-locka for\n$105.7 million\n. The deal brought Blackstone and Link Logistics\u2019 South Florida sales since November to more than $1 billion.\n\nIn April, Blackstone paid\n$115.9 million\nfor the 359-unit Solea at Miami Lakes apartment complex at 17405 Northwest 94th Court in Miami Lakes. The firm has also financed South Florida projects this year, providing a\n$300 million\nloan in May for Karim Alibhai\u2019s Gencom and Edgardo DeFortuna\u2019s Fortune International Group\u2019s renovation of the Ritz-Carlton Key Biscayne at 455 Grand Bay Drive, and planned renovation of the Grand Bay Club at 425 Grand Bay Drive in Key Biscayne. The debt was a refinancing of a previous loan.\nIn the past five years,\nBrickell\nhas emerged as an epicenter of South Florida\u2019s luxury condo market and also became a magnet for out-of-state companies expanding and moving to South Florida.\nThe neighborhood has hosted continuing investment sales activity over the past year, despite elevated interest rates, a slower in-migration of new-to-market firms and other economic headwinds. Some buyers closed their purchases with all cash, avoiding more expensive financing.\nIn May, Melo Group paid more than\n$200 million\nfor the 2.8-acre Brickell City Centre development site at 700-799 Brickell Avenue. The seller, Swire, canceled its planned office supertall on the site, citing a \u201cchallenging\u201d office market amid slower preleasing. Also at Brickell City Centre, Dubai-based hospitality firm Kerzner International bought a nearly 1-acre development site at 9 Southeast Sixth Street that\u2019s proposed for 350 condos and 180 hotel keys for\n$45 million\n.\nSwire continued cashing out of Brickell City Centre this year, selling its 75 percent stake in the retail and parking portion at the complex to Simon Property Group for\n$512 million\nin June.\nSpanish billionaire Amancio Ortega, known for closing his deals in all cash, is under a\n$275 million\ncontract for the 30-story Sabadell Financial Center at 1111 Brickell Avenue.\n",

        "content": "Coastal California might be one of the country\u2019s most desirable locations to buy a home, but investors in the Golden State are fleeing inland in search of deals.\nFrom the beginning of 2024 through this June, seven of California\u2019s 10 biggest increases in investor share of homebuyers were far away from the ocean, the Orange County Register\nreported\n, citing data from\nCotality\n, formerly known as CoreLogic.\nSan Jose and Greater Los Angeles continue to attract investors looking to purchase homes. But several inland cities, many in the Central Valley, saw the fastest increases in investor activity in that year-and-a-half period.\nIn third place is Hanford in the Central Valley, which saw 34 percent investor share of homebuying in the 18-month period compared to 16 percent from 2015 to 2023. Fresno, less than an hour north, witnessed 36 percent of home sales go to investors, contrasting 20 percent over the previous nine years.\n\nVisalia, another Central Valley city not far from Hanford, came in at number five with 35 percent investor interest versus 19 percent from 2015 to 2023. It was followed by Merced with 36 percent, up from 21 percent in the 2015 to 2023 period; Modesto in eighth place at 34 percent compared to 19 percent previously; Stockton with 34 percent investor purchases versus 20 percent in the preceding nine years; and Bakersfield rounding out the top 10 with 32 percent of homebuyers being investors compared to 18 percent from 2015 to 2023.\nAffordability was the likely driver in the uptick in investor interest, according to California Association of Realtors data cited by the Register. In 20 counties spanning Southern California, the Bay Area and the Central Coast, about 17 percent of households could afford to buy a home this spring, down from 21 percent four years prior. In 33 other counties outside those markets, median affordability was higher at 29 percent, though it was also a decrease from 39 percent in 2021.\nOverall, investors made 33 percent of\nhome purchases\nin California in the 18-month period ending in June, up from 21 percent in the nine-year period ending in 2023. The 12 inland metro areas saw the biggest jump among the state\u2019s three core markets, bringing in a median 32 percent investor share of homebuyers versus 19 percent in the previous nine years. By comparison, investor purchases in Southern California increased 11 points to 36 percent in the same period, while it was up 10 points to 34 percent in the Bay Area.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "John McCallion is ready to take MetLife out of one of suburban Chicago\u2019s most high-profile retail corridors, even if it means selling property while a main tenant is having financial trouble.\nA couple years after McCallion-led MetLife Investment Management bought a fully leased Oak Brook shopping center for $41 million, the institutional landlord is testing the market as suburban retail makes a comeback.\nMetLife listed The Overlook at Oak Brook, a 54,000-square-foot property at 1715-1775 West 22nd Street, according to marketing materials. The firm tapped a JLL team to seek buyers for the property, even as a tenant leasing about 20 percent of the floor area, Guidepost Montessori, is making its way through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\nThe property consists of seven free-standing buildings, with its other tenants including Smashburger, Verizon, Panera, Bibibop Asian Grill and Blackwood BBQ.\nIt\u2019s unclear how much the property could fetch, though some Chicago CRE experts are concerned it will be less than MetLife paid due to Guidepost\u2019s problems, according to people familiar with the property. But MetLife persisting with its listing shows it believes the market will price through the potentially temporary blip for the property\u2019s Montessori space. The landlord paid cash for the property and has no mortgage debt to clear, meaning it isn\u2019t on the clock to sell ahead of a loan maturity, according to property records.\nAn insurance giant\u2019s investment arm testing the waters for retail, as other big Chicagoland shopping center properties are vying for deals, shows there\u2019s competition in the sector. The sale effort in Oak Brook comes as real estate players are revving up interest in Chicago-area retail.\nEarlier this year, a joint venture between\nDLC Management, Crow Capital Holdings and Temerity Strategic Partners\npaid nearly $62 million for the 314,800-square-foot Danada Square West property in Wheaton, near Oak Brook, from asset management firm PGIM. Plus, a team of Chicago developers late this summer put the 391,000-square-foot\nNewCity shopping center\nin the coveted Lincoln Park neighborhood up for sale.\n\nThe listings follow\nDRA Advisors\u2019 nearly completing its selloff\nof a massive portfolio of retail assets in the Midwest, concentrated in the Chicago area, which it acquired in a $2.3 billion buyout of an Inland Real Estate entity.\nMetLife and JLL didn\u2019t return requests for comment.\nMetLife acquired the Overlook property in 2023 from GW Properties, the previous firm of developer\nMitch Goltz\nthat has since wound down as he started anew by founding\nGTZ Properties\nlast year. Goltz\u2019s old firm paid nearly $15 million to buy the property in 2018, when it held a 110,000-square-foot Macy\u2019s Furniture Gallery store before it moved to another nearby location.\nIt was then redeveloped through the pandemic into an anchorless shopping center, although the JLL team is now playing up its proximity to the adjacent, separately owned Costco, calling it a \u201cshadow anchor.\u201d Furthermore, Overlook at Oak Brook is kitty-corner from Oakbrook Center, the second-largest shopping mall in Illinois.\nGW dubbed the project a \u201cCovid special\u201d for weathering delays, inflation and rising rates, as the firm took on a $29 million loan for the redevelopment, property records show. GW sold the property to MetLife fully leased. It\u2019s 94 percent occupied today, according to JLL.\nJLL\u2019s Alex Sharrin, Moshin Mirza, Danny Kaufman, Michael Nieder, Brian Page and Danny Finkle are marketing the property on behalf of MetLife.\n",

The asking price for the five bedroom house is $956 per square foot. The 6,800-square-foot house sits on a nearly double lot at 1964 North Burling Street, one of the most exclusive blocks in the city.\nThe couple bought the property in 2002 after it was restored by developer Fred Latsko\u2019s firm, though the sale price wasn\u2019t disclosed in public records. They later acquired the adjacent lot, creating a 50-by-123-foot parcel that gives the home a lawn, patio, rooftop decks and room to entertain.\nColette Cachey Smithburg\nand\nJoelle Hayes\nof @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate have the listing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a piece of history,\u201d Smithburg told the outlet, noting the carved stone fa\u00e7ade, ornate cornice brackets and preserved details like stone mantels and curved staircase railings. The main floor features herringbone-patterned hardwood floors, high ceilings and crown moldings, while a top-floor penthouse room with a bar opens onto a large rooftop deck tucked away from street view.\n\nThe property is in a neighborhood long reshaped by mega-mansions. The Burling corridor just south of Lincoln Park High School has seen teardowns give way to new construction over the last two decades. One neighbor\u2019s palatial estate\nfetched\nmore than $15 million last summer, while a modern villa next door\nclosed\nfor $6.75 million in July.\nThe listing underscores the appetite for historic homes that survived Lincoln Park\u2019s building boom. While many buyers have opted for glassy new builds, well-maintained 19th-century properties with extra land are rare and command a premium.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

That was the last time the city\u2019s real estate market could be defined as \u201cnormal,\u201d according to SF Gate.\nRedfin used a mortgage payment-to-income ratio to make its calculation. By that metric, homes cost about as much as they did before the pandemic, relative to how much money people make.\nIn San Francisco, the median home price has risen 8 percent since July 2018. By contrast, the national median price surged 56 percent over the same time period. At the same time, annual household incomes have grown 7.7 percent in San Francisco, nearly double the 3.9 percent yearly increase across the country.\n\u201cAll of a sudden, you find yourself back to normal, and there\u2019s not this big adjustment that happened,\u201d Chen Zhao, head of economics research at Redfin, told SF Gate, noting that there hasn\u2019t been a \u201ccataclysmic event\u201d like a housing crash or a large decline in mortgage rates that would typically reduce housing costs.\n\nOakland is on track to return to \u201cnormal\u201d housing prices this month if prices remain stable or decline. It\u2019s a promising sign considering no other metro area in the U.S. is expected to reach \u201cnormal\u201d levels until Austin is predicted to in March 2027.\nWith the same calculation at a mortgage rate of 6.7 percent, Sacramento will return to \u201cnormal\u201d in November 2028, San Diego in February 2029 and San Jose in May 2029. Redfin\u2019s projections don\u2019t factor in property taxes or insurance costs, which weigh more heavily on California homeowners.\nAnaheim metro residents are seemingly out of luck, as prices will never return to normal there, according to Redfin\u2019s calculations. This is due to prices increasing so much that it would be virtually impossible to return to pre-pandemic levels, even over the next decade.\nMultifamily vacancy in the Bay Area dropped to 5.3 percent in the first quarter, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s most recent published\nreport\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Henry Bodek of Galaxy Capital arranged the deal, which will support a 280,000-square-foot condominium across three parcels: 65 Franklin Street, 59 Franklin Street and the corner site at 356 Broadway.\nThe assemblage had been in the hands of HAP Investments, the firm led by Eran Polack, which once planned a 19-story, 41-unit condo on the land. HAP picked up the site in 2018 for $46 million and spent years mulling a build that never got off the ground.\nIn March, the firm unloaded 360 Broadway to Sky for $57.6 million, according to Crain\u2019s, setting the stage for a fresh plan.\nHAP\u2019s website once teased a 101,000-square-foot mixed-use condo at 65 Franklin, but Sky\u2019s vision is significantly larger. A source told the Observer that the development will be \u201ca much bigger building than initially thought or planned,\u201d a sign of how bullish the firm is on the downtown condo market.\n\nThe site has historically been a contested one, wrapped in litigation. Charles Dayan\u2019s Bonjour Capital controlled 59 Franklin Street through an LLC, which sued HAP Investments and Noble Construction Group, claiming negligent work at 65 Franklin Street destabilized the building. He was seeking at least $15 million.\nBonjour once filed plans to build an 18-story, 89,000-square-foot building with 89 luxury rentals at 59 Franklin.\nElsewhere in Tribeca, Urban Capital Group and Prosper Property Group have\nassembled\na corner portfolio they plan to turn into a seven-story development with five full-floor loft condominium units and ground-floor retail.\nThe developers purchased the site at 32 Walter Street for $5.25 million.

        "content": "Tenants in a Koreatown apartment building have staged a protest after the landlord proposed replacing parking garage spaces with accessory dwelling units.\nResidents of the 22-unit building at 501 South Kingsley Drive are standing up to the landlord\u2019s plan to remove several spaces used by tenants and convert them into five ADUs, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n. Though tenants are opposed to the move, state and city government officials have given the green light to the redevelopment.\nThe replacement of car spaces with\nADUs\nin infamously parking-strapped Koreatown is made possible by Senate Bill 1211, which passed last year. Under that law, local agencies are not required to replace parking spaces for tenants if the spaces are demolished by owners and property managers to make way for ADUs in an effort to increase housing density.\nTo show their opposition to the removal, tenants of the apartment building, at 5th and Kingsley,\u00a0 set up a peaceful protest using a long white plastic table and outdoor chairs to occupy some parking spaces. The protest has been going for three weeks after they were informed that building management company North Oak Property Management was pursuing an ADU conversion plan.\n\u201cWe found the permits online before they ever announced anything,\u201d resident Megan Thomas Bradner told the outlet. \u201cThey actually never officially notified us of the construction. All it said was, \u2018You have no parking as of this day.\u2019\u201d\nThe Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety approved its permit in April and offered tenants a monthly $200 credit for each parking spot lost as well as a \u201cTenant Habitability Plan,\u201d a spokesperson for North Oak Property Management told the outlet. But the habitability plan the tenants received was blank, the outlet said.\nThe protestors at 501 South Kingsley have been able to delay the project so far. Construction was expected to start late last month and wrap up next June, but the sit-in protest has seemingly cauased the project to pause.\nAnother garage-to-ADU conversion project at 450 South Normandie Avenue received a stop-work order. That rendered the parking spaces useless for residents and the owner.\n\nMark Nassab, building owner for 450 South Normandie, said the project has been in full compliance with city and state law since the beginning.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to help the city of L.A. combat shortages of housing, and we\u2019re following the law, and I wish tenants would do the same,\u201d Nassab said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to provide more housing.\u201d\nLos Angeles City Councilmember Heather Hutt has fielded letters from tenants, as have the Los Angeles City Planning Department and other agencies. Hutt is opposed to the legislation that allows for parking-to-ADU conversions without resident feedback.\n\u201cDecisions are being made in Sacramento without local input,\u201d Hutt said. \u201cLocal governments are better equipped and designed to work directly with the community.\u201d\nParking-to-ADU conversions are legal, but if parking spaces were part of a tenant\u2019s lease agreement, that could entitle the tenants to a rent reduction, a Los Angeles Housing Department spokesperson told the outlet.\nThat doesn\u2019t appear to be the case at 501 South Kingsley.\n\u201cWhat blew my mind was that my lease is apparently just a sheet of paper. It doesn\u2019t do anything,\u201d resident Mel Raymond told the outlet. \u201cI thought my lease was something that protected me.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Elsewhere in DuPage County there are three more apartment complexes underway.

Only one place in the state, Santa Barbara, falls into that category, according to 2020 census\ndata\ncited by Cal Matters.\nThe bill looks to hold back the proposed CEQA exemptions to any projects next to a wetland, a creek and a state-registered historical landmark. It also includes a carveout for projects larger than four acres and those that use\nbuilder\u2019s remedy\nfor development.\nBy process of elimination, those provisions seemingly describe just one project in Santa Barbara: A 270-unit, eight-story building proposed for construction behind the city\u2019s historic Old Mission, according to Cal Matters.\nThe district is represented by Sen. Monique Lim\u00f3n, the incoming leader of the State Senate.\n\nThe planned development has sparked outrage among local residents and city officials, with Mayor Randy Rowse\ndecrying\nit as a \u201chorrendous nightmare.\u201d\nMission LLC, the developers behind the project, have repeatedly sued the city of Santa Barbara claiming the local government has illegally delayed the project and denied awarding a religious-based property tax exemption.\nLim\u00f3n has denied that she is out to prevent Mission LLC\u2019s project with her proposed legislation.\nOpponents of the project have flagged the danger of wildfires and flooding risk in the site north of downtown Santa Barbara. The city, in response, said that the new CEQA exemption legislation, signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom in July, doesn\u2019t apply to the project based on its interpretation of the law. SB 158 reaffirms that position.\nThe 11th-hour exemption is one part of a broader budget trailer bill, meant to direct state agencies on how to distribute the annual budget but often become political lightning rods as a means of trying to effect policy changes. Budget bills, unlike other legislation in the body, are written by the entire budget committee rather than individual legislators.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "As the summer heat broke in Manhattan in August, so did a streak of record-breaking rents.\nMedian rent for a new, brokered lease in Manhattan last month fell to $4,600, according to the monthly rent report from Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel. That\u2019s a 2 percent\ndecline from the peak reported in July\n.\nSo ends a period of record-high prices that\nbegan in February\n. The numbers reflect the forces beginning to moderate rents in the city, including falling mortgage rates. But just because rents aren\u2019t rising, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re likely to fall significantly, according to report author Jonathan Miller. Manhattan rents in August were still the third-highest in history and have increased more than 8 percent in a year.\n\u201cPretty significant price growth is being maintained,\u201d said Miller.\nThirty-year mortgage rates fell to their lowest level since October last month. When those rates come down, that entices would-be renters to consider buying a place of their own and, in turn, removes some demand from the rental market.\nBut it\u2019s still fairly surprising that a new record wasn\u2019t set in August, considering it\u2019s typically a high-demand season, according to Miller.\n\u201cRents started banging against the wall of records beginning in January,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes this year so unusual is that it\u2019s had a defiance of seasonality.\u201d\n\nThe\nFederal Reserve is widely expected\nto cut interest rates at its meeting next week, which could moderate mortgage rates \u2014 and potentially rents \u2014 further.\nAnother factor perhaps influencing rent movement is\nthe FARE Act\n, the city law that prohibits brokers from charging fees to tenants who didn\u2019t hire them, after it went into effect in June. Listing inventory as measured by the report fell in both Manhattan and Brooklyn, as brokers and landlords may be working out how to comply with the law. Listing inventory in Manhattan fell 10 percent month over month, and 13 percent in a year.\nThe Elliman data only includes new leases. It\ndoesn\u2019t capture any increases in lease renewals\n, which account for about two-thirds of leases in Manhattan, according to Miller.\nThe FARE Act may be enticing landlords to pursue those renewals, according to Allia Mohamed, CEO of the\nrenter platform openigloo\n. Landlords with units already filled might see the value in avoiding a potentially hefty broker\u2019s fee. Historically, openigloo data shows rent increases associated with lease renewals are typically modest, around 5 percent year over year.\nAlthough rents fell in Manhattan, Brooklyn was a different story. The median rent for a new, brokered lease reached $3,950, an all-time high. (Trends in the borough are often just slightly behind those in Manhattan, Miller said).\nNabbing a rental remains competitive. About one-third of new Brooklyn leases were subject to bidding wars, which raised prices on those units an average of 11 percent. In Manhattan and Northwest Queens, about one-quarter of leases were signed after bidding wars.\nIn Northwest Queens, the median rental price reached $3,775, a 0.7 percent increase from July and a 6.6 percent increase over last August.\n",

        "content": "The industry is scrambling to ensure Andrew Cuomo is the next mayor. The industry is resigned to a socialist mayor.\nBoth these things can be true because, unlike\nthe Borg\n, the real estate industry isn\u2019t a cybernetic collective with shared consciousness.\nRelated Companies CEO Jeff Blau threw up the bat signal Monday night, calling on fellow developers and other ultrawealthy donors to meet the next morning,\nthe New York Times reported\n. According to the Times, the attendees convened to strategize former Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s path to victory. Whether this translated to a concrete action plan or simply executives cutting checks in the Pool Room of the Seagram Building, is unclear.\nOf course, if the strategy is to throw more money on the campaign, that is pretty much the same strategy employed pre-primary.\nMeanwhile, some affordable housing developers are concluding \u2014\u00a0as the Borg like to say \u2014\u00a0resistance is futile.\nA developer told me\nlast week\nthat folks in this space are meeting Mamdani and keen to be part of his agenda-setting and administration-building conversations. The Wall Street Journal spoke with developers who are\ndrafting housing proposals\nfor Mamdani.\nSome in the industry decided to support Mamdani post-primary, simply because he\u2019s the Democratic nominee. As I\u2019ve previously\nreported\n, professionals in the affordable and nonprofit housing world, as well as other sectors (property management, construction, architecture and brokerage) have also donated to his campaign, though not to the same degree we\u2019ve seen with Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams.\nThe point is: there are many rooms in this industry, not just the Pool Room. Even within each of these rooms, there are variations. (Related, one of the city\u2019s largest developers, got its start in affordable housing, which it still builds in addition to luxury residential, office towers, etc.)\nAnd how the people in these rooms view the race is fluid.\nA poll by the New York Times and Siena University found that 46 percent of likely voters intend to cast their ballot for Assembly member Zohran Mamdani. The polls showed Cuomo in second with 24 percent.\nThe margins narrow considerably if the race becomes a two-way contest between Mamdani and Cuomo, with the former taking 48 percent and the latter 44 percent of the vote. Adams and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa have maintained that they are staying in the race, and even if they drop out, they will likely\nremain on the ballot\n.\nStill, if the race narrows to two contenders, the calculus may change for those looking to work with Mamdani. It is going to be a long two months!\n\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nAre you a developer who decided against pursuing a project \u2014\u00a0either in the very early stages or once public review has started \u2014\u00a0because the local Council member made their opposition clear? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The Vatican has had an observatory since 1891, which is now run by Guy Consolmagno, who is known as the \u201cPope\u2019s Astronomer,\u201d\naccording to the New Yorker\n.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Testimony got heated during recent public hearings about the downstate casino bids,\nThe City\nreported. At meetings in Queens and the Bronx, supporters and opponents weighed the value of the promised community benefits and economic activity of two controversial proposals for new developments atop public parks: Steve Cohen and Hard Rock International\u2019s bid for Citi Field and Bally\u2019s proposed casino at Ferry Point Park.\n\u2014 Greenpoint residents are complaining about worsening fumes, dust and odors from Long Island City\u2019s Green Asphalt plant, according to\nGothamist\n. The plant says it hasn\u2019t changed its operations since opening in 2011, but locals believe the problem has gotten noticeably worse over the last three years. The Department of Environmental Conservation has cited the facility for air quality violations and ordered it to raise its smokestack and add emissions controls. Compliance, however, remains unclear.\n\u2014 Apartment construction in the city took a nosedive, declining 67 percent this year, according to data from CoStar,\nCommercial Observer\nreported. Developers pointed to the new 485x tax abatement for driving up costs and eroding returns, while shifting investments toward existing buildings instead of new ones.\u00a0 \u2014\nQuinn Waller\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$14 million\nfor a 6,000-square-foot co-op at 1010 Fifth Avenue on the Upper East Side. Sheila Ellis and Patricia Wheatley of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$56.7 million\nfor a project that includes 372 Schermerhorn Street and 475 State Street in Downtown Brooklyn. The two buildings are part of a proposed 538-unit project dubbed One Third Avenue;\nThe Real Deal\nreported\nin August on Alloy Development securing $500 million for the development.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$26.8 million\nfor a 3,347-square-foot condominium unit at 15 Central Park West on the Upper West Side. The Mercedes Berk Team with Engel &amp; Volkers has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 42,794-square-foot mixed-use project at 42-62 24 Street in Long Island City. This plan includes an attended parking garage with retail to accompany the 39-story residential project by Grand Construction &amp; Development at 23-07 43 Avenue.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "A massive mixed-use development in Northeast Austin landed financing for its first life sciences building, with one of the sector\u2019s hottest startups signed on as the anchor tenant.\nNew York-based Reger Holdings secured a $75 million note-on-note financing to back a $105 million construction loan for the first lab at EastVillage, a 425-acre project, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe 223,500-square-foot building has been fully pre-leased to Menlo Park, California-based BillionToOne, a molecular diagnostics company that hit unicorn status last year after raising $130 million in a Series D round.\nCalifornia-based Tarlton Properties is\ndeveloping\nsix life sciences buildings at the site, at 3600 Breakthrough Loop along Parmer Lane. At full buildout,\nEastVillage\nis slated to include a 1.5 million-square-foot health and life sciences campus, 350,000 square feet of retail and restaurants, hotels, entertainment space, 2,500 multifamily units and more than 450 single-family homes.\n\nCBRE\u2019s Zack Holderman, Jesse Greshin, Bob Ybarra, Jim Korinek and Doug Birrell arranged the financing.\nHolderman\ncalled the structure a win in what he described as a \u201cchallenged life science construction environment,\u201d noting that the deal provided more than 70 percent loan-to-cost in a sector where capital has tightened.\nConstruction on the life sciences campus started a year ago, with BillionToOne expected to move into its building by late 2026. A timeline for the other five buildings hasn\u2019t been announced, though Gordon Reger, CEO of\nReger Holdings\n, has said full buildout of EastVillage is seven to 10 years away.\nFounded in 2016, BillionToOne develops DNA-based diagnostic tests to detect a range of health problems. Its rapid ascent to unicorn status underscores why developers and lenders still see opportunity in the lab sector despite market headwinds.\nThe project marks another swing at scaling up its life sciences ecosystem in Austin, which has lagged traditional biotech hubs. If EastVillage can deliver on its vision, it could transform a suburban stretch of Parmer Lane into a dense cluster of labs, apartments and retail.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Amy Carr with Engel &amp; V\u00f6lkers Wellington brought the buyer, and Cameron Wentworth Scott with Wellington Equestrian Realty had the listing.\nJohn Malone is a cable magnate and billionaire with a net worth of $11.2 billion, according to Forbes. He is the chairman of Engelwood, Colorado-based Liberty Media, and was CEO of Tele-Communications from 1973 to 1996. As a major shareholder in Discovery, Inc., he was integral to the $43 billion merger with WarnerMedia in 2022, according to\npublished\nreports\n. Through Liberty Media, he also has holdings in Formula 1 and the Atlanta Braves. Dubbed the \u201cCable Cowboy,\u201d Malone is the second largest landowner in North America, with a portfolio of 2.2 million acres, according to the\nLand Report\n. The largest landowner is billionaire lumber mogul Red Emmerson.\nMalone\u2019s wife, Leslie Malone, is an equestrian and patron of the U.S. Olympic Dressage team.\nThe couple bought the 7,300-square-foot Hurlingham Drive house for $7.8 million in 2013, according to property records. Built on 0.9 acres in 1998, the home has seven bedrooms, five bathrooms, one half-bathroom and a pool, records show. It is part of the gated Palm Beach Polo &amp; Country Club neighborhood, and adjacent to the 92-acre Cypress Preserve, which is considered Florida\u2019s largest remaining Cypress Hammock, according to published reports.\n\nThe Malones listed the house for $16 million last year, Zillow shows.\nThe buyer, Charlie Jacobs, is the son of Jeremy Jacobs, who founded the concessions giant Delaware North. The Buffalo, New York-based firm provides food services for Wembley Stadium,\nMetLife Stadium\n, Busch Stadium, and the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, according to its website. The family also owns the Boston Bruins, and Delaware North is the concessions firm for TD Garden, where the team plays.\nThe Jacobs family has an estimated net worth of $5.4 billion, according to Forbes. In 2019, Jeremy Jacobs began passing control of both the Bruins and Delaware North to his six children. Charlie Jacobs is now CEO of both the team and the concessions company.\nHe and his children are competitive equestrians who ride in Wellington\u2019s Winter Equestrian Festival, according to published reports. Jacobs also owns the house at 11663 Maidstone Drive in Wellington, which he bought for $2.8 million in 2021. It hit the market asking $6.8 million in May, Zillow shows. Carr has the listing.\nJacobs\u2019 house-hopping marks the latest pricey\nWellington\ndeal. In August, members of the Anheuser-Busch family\ndropped $24.5 million\non a 42.1-acre equestrian facility in the village.

The 784-unit facility at 23715 Carl Court sold from a private seller in a $27 million off-market deal.\nThe transaction marks Intercontinental\u2019s first foray into the self-storage sector. The property consists of nine single-story buildings and a separate office and residential unit for on-site management, in total spanning 100,000 square feet on a 4.2-acre site. The facility was completed in 1999 and boasts drive-up access for 222 of the 784 units.\nIntercontinental and LaTerra plan to breathe new life into the property with a capital improvement program including upgrades to the management office, hallway lighting, entry security and on-site landscaping.\nThe former EZ Access property will be rebranded as a Public Storage, which has been tapped as the management company to oversee day-to-day operations on the site. It will be one of eight Public Storage facilities within a 3-mile radius, according to Multi-Housing News, citing Yardi Matrix\ndata\n.\n\nIn total, residents will have more than 15 square feet of rentable space per capita. In the Los Angeles metro, self-storage space is at 5 square feet per capita, below the national average of between 10 and 13 square feet per capita.\n\u201cThe market is significantly under-supplied,\u201d Bryan Miranda, managing director of self-storage at LaTerra, said in a statement,\nper\nthe Boston Real Estate Times.

Northwood acquired the properties in 2021\nfor $325 million\n, using a $227 million acquisition loan from Ares Commercial Real Estate.\nThe pair of buildings had been owned by the Propp family since 1987 before Northwood\u2019s acquisition, according to public records.\nA Newmark team including Jordan Roeschlaub and Nick Scribani arranged the deal.\nThe buildings at 520 and 524 Broadway have a combined 180,000 square feet of office space and 60,000 square feet of retail space. At the time of the acquisition, the buildings were 90 percent leased.\n\nCryptocurrency firm Artemis recently signed a five-year sublease at 520 Broadway, joining another recent crypto addition to the building, MoonPay. Other office tenants at the 11-story building include NoHo Hospitality Group and LaPlaca Cohen; Lululemon and Balthazar are retail tenants.\nThe most prominent tenant at 524 Broadway is WeWork, which occupies nearly half the floors in the 11-story building. Aritizia was a retail tenant at one time, but has since left the space.\nElsewhere in Soho, a venture capital firm started by Reddit co-founder and Serena Williams\u2019 husband, Alexis Ohanian, recently inked a\nlong-term lease\nfor an entire building at 216 Lafayette Street.\nIn February, Northwood and Bohannon Companies\nfiled preliminary plans\nto redevelop a 71-year-old mall in San Mateo, California, aiming to transform the site into a retail village complete with nearly 1,400 homes.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The Boca Raton City Council agreed to wait for a voter referendum before formally approving a 99-year lease that would enable Miami-based Terra and Palm Beach-based Frisbie Group to build apartments, condos, retail, and offices on public land.\nOn Tuesday evening, elected officials instructed the city attorney to add in a referendum clause to any proposed lease after hearing from dozens of residents who demanded a special election on the latest plans by Terra and Frisbie to build on 30 acres of city-owned land at West Palmetto Park Road and Northwest Second Avenue.\nUnder the revised plan, Terra and Frisbie would build 580 apartments, 160 condos, 80,000 square feet of retail, and 250,000 square feet of offices along with a redesigned Memorial Park, a new city hall and community center and other public improvements.\nFrisbie managing partner Ron Frisbie, Jr. and Terra CEO David Martin said the new design is far less dense than their earlier 1.5-million-square-foot proposed project that included 912 residential units, 150 hotel rooms, 350,000 square feet of offices and 152,000 square feet of retail.\nFrisbie told council members the developers downsized their project and added more green space in\nresponse to residents\nwho appeared a week prior at city hall in droves to oppose the mega-development.\u00a0 He also said he was not against holding a referendum and agreed to hold public workshops with residents on Sept. 29 at the city\u2019s downtown library and on Oct. 6 at the Spanish River Library, both at 4 p.m. Plus, Frisbie said his team was eager to meet with local homeowners\u2019 associations and would not push for a development agreement to be approved by late October, as the city originally scheduled.\n\u201cWe need to get the community behind this project,\u201d Frisbie told council members. \u201cThis is a [really] exciting plan and they should get to vote on it.\u201d\nBesides removing the hotel concept and reducing the number of units and retail space, the new Terra-Frisbie plan includes a new tennis center with up to 10 clay courts, a playground that will incorporate banyan trees on site, a World War II memorial and a new children\u2019s museum.\n\nA reduced site plan, though, also means less money for the city in terms of rent and taxes. Under the larger plan, the developers said they would pay out about $3 billion over the course of the 99-year lease. Through the scaled-down plans, the developers would pay the city about $2.1 billion. Terra and Frisbie would also obtain a developer fee for building a new city hall and other public facilities, although Frisbie said his team was still committed to providing $10 million for a pedestrian bridge near Brightline\u2019s Boca Raton station between the government campus and Mizner Park.\nBut the new concessions did little to dissuade opposition from critics who now collected 7,000 signatures for an ordinance or charter amendment that would require a public vote prior to the sale or leasing of more than a half-acre of public land. About 1,000 of those signatures were collected over the weekend when Boca Raton was hit with torrential storms, said Jon Pearlman, founder of Save Boca.\n\u201cRight now, the land is public. They want to get it into their possession. And once they get it, they will have full control over it for the next 99 years,\u201d Pearlman said.\nSeveral residents said they would rather the city renovate or replace city hall and other public facilities on its own, without handing over public land and attracting more traffic that would ruin Boca Raton\u2019s small town appeal. In addition, the present plans still include moving some of Memorial Park\u2019s recreational facilities, such as its two softball fields, to other parts of the city.\nIn February, Terra and Frisbie beat out\nWest Palm Beach-based Related Ross and two other development teams\nin a city bid for the redevelopment of Boca Raton\u2019s \u201cgovernment campus\u201d area. At the time, the Terra-Frisbie project was 2.5 million square feet and included 1,129 residential units.\nAside from that project, Terra and Frisbie are also moving forward\nwith redeveloping the Palm Beach Kennel Club site\nin Palm Beach County with as many as 1,145 apartments.\nBoca Raton and nearby West Boca Raton have attracted increased attention from developers. Among developments moving forward is a\n$101 million, 306-unit apartment project\nthat is slated to be built by Mill Creek and Group P6 in downtown Boca Raton. Local developers James and Marta Batmasian also received the backing of the Boca Raton Planning and Zoning Board to\nbuild two 12-story hotel towers by Mizner Park.",

It also claims that John failed to provide evidence of an agreement with Prime that outlined exactly how the loans would be paid to John.",

        "content": "Residential supply and demand are balancing out in Fort Worth, and the seller\u2019s market is long gone.\nThe city had 4.1 months inventory in August, compared to 3.7 a year prior, according to the Greater Fort Worth Association of Realtors. Inventory has been trending up in the area since 2022.\n\u201cLast year, we were still solidly in a seller\u2019s market with low inventory. In some areas, we had less than a month inventory on the market,\u201d said Paul Epperley, president of the Greater Fort Worth Association of Realtors.\nCowtown is more stable than Dallas and other major Texas cities. Tarrant County had 3.9 months inventory last month, while Dallas County had 4.7, and Texas had 5.5.\n\u201cDallas had a little bit of an explosion of inventory in the second quarter this year,\u201d Epperley said.\n\nActive listings are up 11 percent year over year, and closings are up 2 percent in Tarrant County.\nClosings in the Fort Worth suburb Aledo are up a whopping 500 percent year over year, due to the Walsh Ranch development, which is projected to deliver 18,000 homes once complete.\nColleyville is one of the only areas in Tarrant County where the average price per square foot rose 11 percent or more, along with the zip code that includes Meacham International Airport.\nPrices rose modestly in suburban Grapevine and east Keller to the north, and in Benbrook, Kennedale and Arlington to the south and east. Prices dipped along the Interstate 35 West corridor, from Burleson to west Keller, and plummeted in downtown Fort Worth and the Haltom City area.Other Texas metros are more firmly in a buyer\u2019s market.\nAustin had one of the highest seller-to-buyer ratios in the country this summer\n, and months of inventory grew especially high in the luxury and\ncondo\nsubmarkets. In San Antonio,\nwhere sellers have been reluctant to adjust\ntheir expectations with the market,\nsales plunged 10 percent year over year in July\n.\n",

Morgan Asset Management declined to comment. A Newmark team led by Adam Spies and Josh King is running the process.\n\nThe asking price for the roughly 587,000-square-foot building works out to about $450 per square foot.\nJPMorgan paid $470 million for the 1980s-era building in 2013 from BXP (then known as Boston Properties), which had acquired it as part of the $3.9 billion deal to buy a portfolio of buildings previously owned by Harry Macklowe, including the General Motors Building.\nJust a few weeks after JPMorgan put the property up for sale in early 2020, the first cases of Covid appeared in New York and the city went into shutdown. Many owners pulled their properties from the market and reassessed their plans.\nIn the meantime, the city\u2019s office market has gone from doom and gloom to recovery. Early on, vacancies spiked and many questioned whether workers would ever return to the office like they had pre-pandemic.\nNow, Manhattan\u2019s office leasing activity is on track to record its best year since 2019. Still, with high interest rates and the costs associated with attracting new tenants, many buildings are still trading at discounts to previous valuations.\n",

Records show a Lennar affiliate bought the land at the intersection of Krome Avenue and Southwest 288th Street from Pedro Adrian\u2019s Adrian Homes.\nAdrian bought the properties for a combined $11.5 million in a pair of deals in 2022 and 2023, according to property records.\nMiami-based Lennar applied for a rezoning last year, planning records show. Miami-based Pascual, Perez, Kiliddjian, Starr &amp; Associates designed the site plan. It utilizes a 25 percent workforce housing density bonus, allowing for 3.1 dwelling units per acre, the plans show.\n\nLennar\nhas already launched sales for Redlands Ridge, although it is currently advertising only 78 homesites, its website shows. The planned homes range in size from 1,800 square feet to 2,800 square feet, with three bedrooms to five bedrooms. Prices range from $646,000 to $816,000, the website shows.\nLennar, led by Executive Chairman and co-CEO Stuart Miller and co-CEO and President Jon Jaffe, is one of the largest homebuilding companies in the country. It has a prolific pipeline in South Florida, with thousands of units planned across the region.\nIn June, Lennar proposed a\n106-townhome project\nnear Homestead. That same month, it won approval for a 50-townhome project in\nWilton Manors\n, with prices starting at $800,000. In February, it proposed\nRodan Estates\n, a development with 192 single-family homes in south Miami-Dade County.\nMore recently, the developer landed a high-profile investor. Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway bought more than 7 million shares for\nnearly $800 million\n. News of the cash influx sent Lennar\u2019s stock surging, and it now sits at $140 per share as of 2 p.m. on Thursday.",

        "content": "California legislators are looking to stop some of the bleeding brought on by Measure ULA, or the so-called \u201cmansion tax\u201d in the City of Los Angeles.\nOn Tuesday, lawmakers released a bill that seeks to cut tax rates for some newly built multifamily and commercial properties, LAist\nreported\n. Luxury homes would still be subject to the full tax levy under the new proposal, save for those rebuilt after a natural disaster in the previous five years.\nThe move is purportedly being done in response to criticism that Measure ULA p\nushes away developers\nwhen increased housing production is desperately needed in the city. Since April 2023, the voter-approved Measure ULA has imposed a 4 percent tax on property sales above $5 million and 5.5 percent on transactions totaling more than $10 million.\nIn the more than two years since then, Measure ULA is estimated to have collected $830 million in revenue to fund rent relief, eviction defense and affordable housing programs. However, only a small fraction of the funds have been spent actually building multifamily affordable housing as of May, according to the city\u2019s most recent\nbudget report\ncited by LAist. The tax\u2019s application to any sale of any property at more than $5 million\u2013regardless of profit margins\u2013has also been cited as a damper on development in the City of Los Angeles specifically.\n\nIn the new bill, co-authored by state senators Lena Gonzalez and Tina McKinnor, some commercial properties built within the last 15 years would have their ULA tax lowered to 1.5 percent. It would also relax some financing restrictions in Measure ULA, such as the requirement that financially distressed apartment buildings that received city funding could only be sold to certain buyers, such as nonprofit organizations and community land trusts.\nThe signs appear to confirm a drop-off in development as a result of Measure ULA. Economic reports cited by LAist claim the tax has caused a sharp decline in housing development activity across the city, with one University of California, Los Angeles study estimating the city would have more affordable housing units if the tax did not apply to new apartment buildings.\nThe new bill will need to be approved by tomorrow in order to make any changes to Measure ULA before the end of the legislative session. In the meantime, the Los Angeles Housing Department is gearing up to\ndistribute a record $387 million\nlargely raised via the mansion tax to build affordable multifamily residences.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "More lenders are going to court to collect debts from Chris and Aneta Urban, whose South Side fix-and-flip business buckled last year as unpaid debts stacked up.\nNewly filed lawsuits brought against the brother-and-sister builders by a fellow member of a local real estate training program are the latest in a string of disputes centered on the Urbans and dozens of their properties across Chicago\u2019s South Side and south suburbs, with more than 80 properties in foreclosure proceedings. Chris Urban\u2019s former mentor, Andrew Holmes, is suing the siblings for fraud.\n\u201cHe\u2019s giving the same runaround, that they\u2019re working with their attorney, that they\u2019re trying to sell his bulk portfolio, and he wants to settle the balance owed,\u201d Wendy Valencia, one of the individuals Chris Urban met and borrowed from through the Holmes network, said of the Urbans. \u201cIn reality, it\u2019s not going to happen because [Chris Urban] is in foreclosure on all the properties, he\u2019s just given out second mortgages like candy, and he doesn\u2019t have equity.\u201d\nStarting in about 2019, the Urbans began buying and rehabbing homes in the South Side, selling some and later venturing into rentals. The Urbans had amassed a portfolio of more than 100 properties, along with a debt of more than $14 million, when they began to have trouble paying their debts,\nThe Real Deal previously reported\n.\nThey borrowed money from fellow members of the Andrew Holmes Mastery Program, a real estate investment training program based in Lombard, as well as Chicago-based lender Renovo Financial.\nValencia is seeking to foreclose on three properties where she loaned the Urbans money that she says wasn\u2019t paid back. Valencia has been in contact with other individual lenders who are planning to foreclose on the Urbans\u2019 properties, and a group of lenders is considering a fraud lawsuit.\nValencia had been lending the Urbans money for their business since 2019, and for a long time she said the debts were being paid without issue. That changed in 2024, when they started to fall behind.\n\u201cHe started to run behind on payments. Just started to get a little bit later and later,\u201d Valencia said. \u201cAnd it would always be just an excuse after another, just something would come up, but then he would send the payment.\u201d\nBut in February, around the time Renovo launched foreclosure proceedings against dozens of the Urbans\u2019 properties, Valencia said the operation fell apart and all payments stopped. Chris promised the individuals from the Andrew Holmes network that he would make good on his debts to them after he finished rehabs and sold his properties, Valencia said. But as time went on, Valencia said she lost faith that she would be repaid.\nChris Urban declined to comment on the ongoing disputes, saying he will resolve them \u201cthrough the courts, not the media.\u201d\nValencia is suing to foreclose on 8014 South Yates Boulevard, where she obtained a second lien in January. Valencia loaned the Urbans $170,000 for a property on South Aberdeen Street in 2024. When they started to fall behind on payments, Valencia said she accepted a short sale of the property and was given second lien positions on two other properties, including 8014 South Yates Boulevard, as collateral for the $80,000 the Urbans still owed her.\nBut that second position lien wasn\u2019t recorded in public records for five months, and the Urbans never made payments on the loan, Valencia said. In April the Urbans gave the South Yates property up to the first lender, VC New Concept LLC, through a quit claim deed without a public record of Valencia\u2019s second lien and without her knowledge, she said.\nValencia is now suing for foreclosure, arguing the property\u2019s first mortgage and ownership merged when VC New Concept was given the real estate, giving her a first lien on the property. She is suing VC New Concept and Fidelity National Title Company, arguing they knew about the second position and the failure to record it harmed her.\nVC New Concept is run by Valdy Biernacki, a real estate broker and investor in Palos Hills. Biernacki did not return a request for comment.\n\nValencia\u2019s experience is shared by other private lenders who knew the Urbans through Holmes\u2019 mastery program, she said, and other lenders are planning to foreclose on properties in the near future.\nIn cases with other investors, Valencia said Urban would do a short sale on properties to satisfy the first mortgage, selling them to another LLC he operates and taking out another private mortgage to fund the purchase. Property records show several instances in which one of the Urbans\u2019 LLCs sold a property to Construction &amp; Technology Solutions, another LLC operated by Chris Urban and Tomasz Szumny.\n\u201cHe basically would do a short payoff with a private lender, and he wouldn\u2019t disclose that he was selling a property to another one of his entities,\u201d Valencia said.\nAndrew Holmes, along with his business partner Mary Desloover, is suing the Urbans for allegedly running a \u201cPonzi-like scheme\u201d by taking loans from individuals intended for rehabilitations to pay off their troubled debts across their properties,\nTRD previously reported\n. The Urbans moved to dismiss the lawsuit in July, arguing Holmes and Desloover didn\u2019t provide enough evidence they had acted fraudulently. Holmes and his attorney declined to comment on the proceedings, and they have until Oct. 1 to reply to the motion.\nValencia is also suing to foreclose on two other properties that she has a first mortgage on through another LLC, Elixir Enterprises.\nElixir loaned the Urbans $175,000 for a mortgage at 12434 South Elizabeth Street in Calumet Park and $125,000 for a mortgage at 10504 South LaSalle Street in Chicago. Valencia said those payments stopped in February along with the others.\nIn another lawsuit filed in July, business loan company OnDeck is trying to recover $87,000 from Urban for a loan that went bad near the end of 2024. Urban took out a $155,000 loan in March 2024, according to the lawsuit, with a one-year repayment period, and began to miss payments in October 2024.\nRenovo foreclosures continue\nAs new lawsuits stack up, the Urbans are still facing foreclosure lawsuits at dozens of properties with loans from Chicago-based Renovo Financial. Renovo pooled those debts into a few trusts and U.S. Bank was appointed as the trustee for the loan package.\nMost of those cases are still being litigated. In several of those lawsuits, the court entered a foreclosure judgment against the Urbans\u2019 properties, in some cases because they didn\u2019t respond and in other cases after they answered the complaint.\nIn a few cases, the Urbans have received judges\u2019 approvals to vacate foreclosure judgments and continue to litigate. In court filings asking to vacate a judgment, the Urbans\u2019 attorney, Jeffrey Dan, noted they were facing more than 60 cases and their lack of answer was \u201cdue to excusable neglect.\u201d\nIn at least two cases, the judge has approved a sheriff\u2019s sale of the properties.\nUrban previously told\nThe Real Deal\nhe planned to sell the properties with Renovo loans to avoid foreclosure. Some of the properties under foreclosure threats have been sold, and at least one lawsuit was dismissed after the property sold, records show.\n",

Last year, Astor paid $10 million for the 1.2-acre site at 315 Northwest 27th Avenue.\nDesigned by Coral Gables-based Hamed Rodriguez Architects, Havana Enclave will have a mix of market-rate studios, one and two-bedroom apartments, a press release states. Astor expects to complete the project in 2027.\nFounded in 2002, Astor has developed condominium and multifamily projects in Brickell, Coconut Grove, Little Havana and Coral Gables, the press release states. In 2023, Astor completed Douglas Enclave, a 10-story, 199-unit project at 61 Northwest 37th Avenue in Miami.\n\nThe developer completed Douglas Enclave with a\n$32.4 million\nloan also provided by Ocean Bank.\nIn\nLittle Havana\n, the average asking rent for a one-bedroom apartment is $2,557 a month, compared to $2,720 a month for Miami overall, according to\nrentcafe.com\n.\nThe neighborhood is experiencing an uptick in multifamily projects under Florida\u2019s\nLive Local Act\n, which grants developers higher density if they set aside 40 percent of apartments for households earning no more than 120 percent of the area median income (AMI). The annual AMI in Miami-Dade County is $87,200, according to the Florida Housing Finance Corporation.\nRecently, an entity led by\nKhashayar Khazai and Shane Shapiro\nof Sunny Isles Beach submitted plans to the city of Miami to build a 23-story tower with 166 apartments and 4,000 square feet of commercial space on a half-acre site at 521 and 531 Southwest Seventh Street in Little Havana.\nThe affordable and workforce housing arm of Coconut Grove-based\nRelated Group\nalso tapped the Live Local Act for a planned 1,038-unit multifamily complex with a pair of 21-story towers and a 12-story building in Little Havana. The project site is at 800 Northwest 13th Avenue, 780 Northwest 13th Court and 1389 Northwest Seventh Street.",

If approved, the local developer\u2019s plan would create more than 200 rental units with ground-floor retail in a crucial shopping corridor of the city.\nThe 20-story building would rise 216 feet and span 221,000 square feet on a site near the Civic Center BART station. The residential portion will account for 194,000 square feet.\nConstruction is estimated to cost $105 million, though that doesn\u2019t include all development costs.

The design from Perry Architects will consist of glass fiber-reinforced concrete and cement plaster with a four-story podium and floor-to-ceiling windows on each floor.

        "content": "Apartment construction in New York City has cratered this year as the housing affordability crisis looms large.\nHousing starts for market-rate units have dropped 67 percent from last year, falling from an average of 7,500 per quarter since 2021 to 2,500 this year, according to CoStar data. The pipeline of units under construction shrank over the same period from 71,000 to 47,000, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n.\nOne culprit, many developers say, is the\n485x property tax abatement\n, which replaced the expired 421a program. While both programs were designed to spur affordable housing development, landlords argue the replacement\npiles on labor mandates and affordability thresholds that tank returns\n.\n\u201cWhen you increase cost to a developer, they may ultimately decide the juice isn\u2019t worth the squeeze,\u201d CoStar\u2019s Victor Rodriguez told the Observer.\nConstruction costs were already a barrier, as New York is one of the priciest markets in the world to build. Add soaring land prices, high union wages and elevated interest rates, and the calculus for ground-up development becomes tougher. Many investors are instead buying existing rentals, betting on steady rent growth. That metric stands at 2.7 percent this year, more than double the national average.\nConversions are offering a partial release valve. As of February, more than 8,300 apartments were in the pipeline from office-to-resi projects, led by marquee redevelopments at 5 Times Square and the former Pfizer headquarters on East 42nd Street.\n\nThe city has streamlined approvals for such projects, making them more appealing than costly office repositionings. Still, the numbers pale in comparison to the scale of demand.\nDevelopers and investors remain split on the future of 485x. Lev Kimyagarov, managing principal and co-founder at Development Site Advisors, previously said the law at least \u201cfixes real flaws\u201d in 421a and can work in today\u2019s political climate.\nThe looming mayoral election is another overhang: 40 percent of real estate professionals cited government policy as the biggest hurdle to projects, according to CoStar.\nFor now, the city\u2019s housing supply continues to lag. Apartment inventory grew 6 percent between 2020 and 2024, compared to more than 20 percent in Orlando and Austin.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Michael Shvo has had his fair share of issues across his career as a broker and developer, only to walk away unscathed.\nAt 125 Greenwich, a planned 88-story high-end condo tower in downtown Manhattan, Shvo\u2019s partners\u00a0 bought out his interest when he was indicted on tax evasion in 2016. The development group struggled to sell condos, and one of the project\u2019s lenders stopped funding the project. Construction stalled and lender BH3 Management threatened to foreclose. Eventually, Fortress Investment Group took over the project.\nShvo, who pleaded guilty and resolved his tax issues without a jail sentence, may have been the only original partner to make money in the deal.\nNow, Shvo is the one dealing with BH3, which this time holds the loan on the iconic Raleigh Miami Beach redevelopment project.\nThe drama has been high for months as the project sits in limbo. Last month, the Wall Street Journal published an\narticle\nwith the headline: \u201cA Luxury Real-Estate Builder\u2019s Improbable Comeback Is Starting to Crumble.\u201d\nCan Shvo manage to stay in this deal and pull off another comeback?\nShvo has been in arbitration proceedings with one of his German investors, with Shvo seeking $85 million in fees he alleges he\u2019s owed. A source familiar with the matter said the arbitration proceedings have been resolved. If he secured the $85 million, he could use that cash to help fund his equity position in the Raleigh.\nAs Shvo plots a way to hold onto the stalled luxury condo and hotel development, a rival bidder, Nahla Capital, is working on its plans in the event it takes over the property.\nShvo and his partners, Deutsche Finance America and a consortium of German pension funds\npaid $243 million\nfor the 3-acre property at 1775, 1757 and 1751 Collins Avenues in 2019 with plans for the Rosewood-branded project. The assemblage includes the Richmond and South Seas hotels.\u00a0In 2023, the partners secured\na $190 million refinancing\nfrom BH3, a Fort Lauderdale-based alternative lender led by Dan Lebensohn and Greg Freedman. BH3 has extended the maturity date for the loan, most recently with an extension that expires in October, but could be extended again. Shvo is current on the loan, according to a source.\nHere\u2019s what could happen next:\nNahla Capital\u2019s bid\nThe Raleigh\u2019s ownership hired Newmark earlier this year to market the property to potential bidders. Newmark\u2019s Adam Spies and Marcella Fasulo are representing the ownership.\nNew York-based Nahla Capital won the bid to purchase the project for about $275 million, as first reported by\nBusiness Insider\nin July. Shvo had the right of first refusal and is trying to match the offer, though a source said his right of first refusal expired.\nNahla is a private equity firm with $2 billion in assets under management, led by Genghis Hadi. The firm has experience in the same arena as the Raleigh project: It recently completed The Rosewood Residences Beverly Hills.\n\nNahla would take over construction of the Raleigh project, which has not gone vertical, though site work has been completed.\nNahla is moving toward signing a contract, sources said. The company is reportedly working to assemble a team in Miami Beach, if Shvo loses the property. Nahla would likely keep the current plans for a Rosewood-branded condo and hotel in place. (Shvo hired Peter Marino and Kobi Karp Architecture &amp; Interior Design to design the Raleigh.)\nNahla did not respond to requests for comment.\nShvo\u2019s plan\nThe Shvo-led partnership has gutted the original buildings, which include the historic Art Deco Raleigh, South Seas and Richmond hotels, and planned a new 17-story luxury condo tower on the beachfront site. But vertical construction has stalled.\nTo hold onto control of the Raleigh, Shvo would have to raise new money to pay off his partners, and likely secure new debt, Business Insider reported. Shvo did not respond to requests for comment.\nShvo has missed the peak of the cycle in what\u2019s one of the hottest markets in the country. The developer tapped Oren and Tal Alexander\u2019s now-defunct brokerage, Official, to lead sales of the project in 2023. The following year, the brothers were accused of drugging and raping women. Official lost its new development business. The brothers, who deny the allegations, are in jail awaiting their sex trafficking trial in January.\nOfficial\u2019s invitation-only strategy focused on Rosewood VIPs and friends of Marino and Shvo. All buyers had to be\ninterviewed and approved\nby Shvo. The strategy backfired, industry insiders said.\nLast summer, Anna Sherrill of One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty took over presales.\nPresales at the Raleigh have continued to lag behind its competitors. The Raleigh\u2019s closest competition is Witkoff and Monroe Capital\u2019s Auberge Resorts-branded Shore Club luxury condo and hotel project, at 1901 Collins Avenue in Miami Beach. It\u2019s nearly fully presold, sources said. A penthouse at the Shore Club is reportedly under contract to sell for over $120 million, or more than $11,000 per square foot.\nShvo has contracts signed for nine of the 44 luxury condos planned at The Raleigh, according to a source. The Wall Street Journal reported the highest known price for a unit in contract is nearly $8,500 per square foot or more than $50 million, but most presales are in the $5,000-plus per square foot range.\nMeanwhile, Shvo has parted with one of his other properties in Miami Beach.\nLast week, he sold his Alton Road assemblage, where he planned a luxury office and apartment project, to Infinity Collective. Sources told\nTRD\nthe property was being marketed for sale with a whisper price equal to the amount of the\n$28.3 million loan\n.\nShvo still owns a portion of the development for his One Soundscape Park office project at 1665 and 1667 Washington Avenue in Miami Beach.\nKeith Larsen contributed to this story.\n",

Forman Capital is also seeking default interest and fees totaling roughly $220,000.\nThrough a spokesperson, Forman Capital declined to comment. Joseph Pardo, the attorney for the Kodsi entities, said his clients are seeking a quick resolution.\n\u201cThis project is transitioning from a land loan to a construction loan, and this is a timing issue,\u201d Pardo said. \u201cWe are in active negotiations with the lender to resolve this, and we fully expect that it will be resolved promptly.\u201d\n\nThe\nKodsi\nentities, which paid a combined $10.7 million for the assemblage in 2022, are working with the city of Miami to finalize the project\u2019s design and the permitted density, Pardo said.\nLast year, Forman Capital provided the loan to refinance a previous mortgage, records show.\nKodsi and former partner Rafael Pecchio had previously planned a 200-unit apartment building. But Peccio bowed out, and Kodsi changed course with new plans for a condo-hotel with 360 units, including some short-term rentals.\nKodsi is also fighting a separate foreclosure case involving his Legacy Hotel &amp; Residences project at Miami Worldcenter that is currently under construction. Recently, Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Spencer Eig gave the Kodsi entity developing the Miami Worldcenter project roughly two months to pay back more than\n$35 million\nto another lender, New York-based Monarch Alternative Capital.\nIn July,\nMonarch\nfiled a foreclosure complaint tied to the partially built 50-story mixed-use condo and hotel tower at 942 Northeast First Avenue in downtown Miami.

        "content": "Homes sold in an average of 37 days in Chicago this August, faster than nearly every other major city.\nNationally, deals took 60 days on average, a slowdown from last year, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nOak Park real estate agent Swati Saxena told the outlet that one of her listings on Ridgeland Avenue went under contract in five days at $652,000, while buyers she represented grabbed a $935,000 Grove Avenue house just as fast. Both closed in August, a month when Chicago tied for the nation\u2019s second-fastest-selling housing market behind Milwaukee, according to Realtor.com. Chicago tied for second-fastest with Buffalo, New York, Grand Rapids, Michigan and Cincinnati.\nIn Chicago, sales were only a day slower than August 2024, signaling resilience even as interest rates and prices kept many markets in check.\nLow supply is the culprit. Illinois had one of the steepest inventory drops in the nation, with Chicago buyers facing less than 40 percent of the listings available in 2019, housing tracker ResiClub reported. That\nshortage\nkeeps demand concentrated on the \u201cgood\u201d listings \u2014 those well-priced, well-located or turnkey \u2014 which in many cases spark bidding wars and premiums over ask.\n\nIn La Grange, Coldwell Banker\u2019s Judy Ellison and Teresa Fox sold a 1920s Stone Avenue house for nearly 15 percent over list in mid-August after it found a buyer in two days. In Lakeview, Compass agent Tony Mattar priced a condo low to draw multiple offers and sold it in a week for 2.6 percent over ask. And in Avondale, Baird &amp; Warner\u2019s Patrick Hinton watched at least a dozen households flood an open house before his condo listing landed a buyer six days later, closing above ask.\nThe \u201ccircular problem,\u201d Ellison said, is that many owners won\u2019t sell without knowing where they\u2019ll go next. That keeps fresh supply from hitting the market, which in turn fuels even more aggressive buyer behavior. For renters feeling squeezed, the urgency is amplified. In the West Loop, Compass agent Quentin Green\u2019s clients jumped on a $910,000\ncondo\nwith a rooftop deck in five days, citing ballooning rents.\nAs fast as these\ntransactions\nare, there is still room for fallout. Chicago had 16 percent of pending home purchase agreements fall through in July, up from about 15 percent a year prior, according to Redfin. Contract cancellations were similarly high in July 2023, when 16 percent of pending deals fell through.\nNot every property flies \u2014 overpriced or less appealing\nhomes\ncan linger \u2014 but for listings under $1 million in hot neighborhoods like Lincoln Park, speed is the rule. As one broker put it, if it doesn\u2019t sell in a week, something\u2019s wrong.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The deal would be for about 47,000 square feet in the six-story building.\nPIMCO Prime Real Estate, formerly Allianz Real Estate, owns the building. The Munich, Germany-based PIMCO subsidiary bought a 45 percent stake in the property from Columbia Property Trust in 2020 for $180 million. It went on to grab another 45 percent stake after\nPIMCO acquired Columbia\nin late 2021. PIMCO-owned Columbia is still responsible for managing the building.\nAffirm was founded in 2012 by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin and set up shop at 650 California Street in Chinatown, also owned by Columbia, in 2017. At that time, the company signed an eight-year lease for 86,000 square feet across four floors in the building. The firm seemingly extended its lease at some point as it has one more year left on its lease, according to the Business Times.\n\nIf the deal closes, Affirm\u2019s headquarters would be smaller than its space at 650 California, though the company has subleased some of its space there to other tenants in recent years. The fintech firm reported impairment charges of $1.2 million in 2023 and $800,000 last year for subleasing out portions of its offices.\nAside from Affirm, software company\nDocuSign\nand financial services company Prosper Marketplace also have offices at 221 Main Street. Late last year, math-focused high school\nProof School\nleased about 35,000 square feet on the first and second floors of the building. JLL, working with Columbia to lease the building, is searching for a tenant or tenants to lease approximately 123,000 square feet in the building.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The plans also call for The Hangar, a 12,000-square-foot aviation-themed event venue, along with rooftop patios, restaurants, public plazas, and a Texas-style beer garden.\nThe development will connect directly to Addison Circle Park and the Cotton Belt Trail Corridor, part of the region\u2019s 57-mile hike-and-bike system.\nAddison is chipping in $40 million for infrastructure and two parking garages, while Quadrant is expected to put up more than $200 million in private capital. City leaders project the development will support more than 1,600 permanent jobs and generate over $300 million in annual economic output once built. Construction is slated for 2026, though no tenants have been signed for the office space, and the hotel operator is still under negotiation.\n\nThe project is years in the making.\nAddison\nbegan acquiring land along the rail line in the 1980s, anticipating future transit-oriented development. In 2019, the city adopted a special area plan to guide growth around the Silver Line station.\nThe deal with Quadrant\nreplaced\na $472 million plan with Stream Realty Partners and Amli Residential that included housing. Changing market conditions and a shift in partners redirected the vision toward a commercial and entertainment-heavy mix.\nThe development will plug directly into the 26-mile Silver Line,\nlinking\nPlano, Richardson, Carrollton, Cypress Waters, Dallas and DFW International Airport. The project joins a wave of transit-oriented bets as North Texas suburbs look to turn commuter rail into an economic engine.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "SRS Real Estate Partners is riding the profitable wave of retail real estate with the hire of Ryan Byrne.\nByrne, who previously spent 10 years as a partner at Byrne Company, is joining the Dallas-based firm as its leader of retail investments for the south central region, which includes Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Louisiana.\nThe death knell of retail has been foretold plenty of times in the last two decades, but the asset class has emerged stronger after its last existential threat, the pandemic. It\u2019s even\nweathering the closure of big box stores\nlike\nForever 21\nand\nParty City\nwith relative ease.\nThe retail market in Dallas-Fort Worth is healthy, with a vacancy rate of 4.8 percent at the end of the second quarter, unchanged from a year before, according to Partners Real Estate. Average asking rents are up from last year, too, rising from $19.78 per square foot to $20.28.\nThe Real Deal chatted with Byrne about his new role and why retail \u201cis not going anywhere.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s in your wheelhouse in terms of price range?\nIt\u2019s going to be a mix of private, institutional, family office type groups. Five-tenant and above, and roughly $10 million in value.\nGrocery-anchored retail is all the rage. Is that the ideal property for your clients?\nNot necessarily. Grocery-anchored is a really attractive space, but we do power centers. We do some of these lifestyle centers, where it could be a $30 million deal, but we\u2019re in a $250,000 average income market with high home values. Some of those deals might not have a main anchor, but it\u2019s going to be high-end shops and high-end restaurants.\nHow have these types of assets been performing lately?\n\nWe\u2019ve been lucky in the retail space. We had Covid, which caused some problems with some of these shopping centers. We had the Amazon effect that came in. We even had higher interest rates. Retailers weathered the storm on every single one of these.\nPeople have realized that retail is not going anywhere. Americans, just by habit, we like to go and shop. We like to go to restaurants. We like to walk in a store. We like to be social and be around people.\nHow long are investors typically looking to hold these kinds of assets?\nIt really can be all of the above. There are some groups that are going to be short-term value-add buyers that are going to buy and try and push rents, redevelop it, backfill some vacant space and then go sell it pretty quickly. There\u2019s a developer side that\u2019s going to buy the land, go lease up the whole center and sell it off. And then you\u2019ve got a mix of other buyers that will do a five-to-seven year hold, depending on hitting return. And there\u2019ll be other groups that are saying, \u201cHey, I\u2019m just a long term holder. I\u2019m a high net worth group. I\u2019m gonna go hold it, I just want cashflow longterm.\u201d\nWith the closure of big-box stores like Party City and Tuesday Morning, what are you seeing owners do with these big vacant spaces?\nPeople used to get scared of the big box space, but everyone\u2019s realizing\nthey\u2019re getting backfilled quickly\n. Every time something happens, there always tends to be another tenant coming in, and there always tends to be almost a higher and better use that gives opportunity and value to the center. It can be reinvented. You can get a new tenant that changes the model. But there\u2019s always new tenants, especially in Texas, which is one of the strongest markets. Every tenant in the country wants to be here\nWho\u2019s doing that these days? Experiential tenants?\nFitness companies\n?\nIt all depends on the location, on the type of center, on the market, on the incomes. That\u2019s what\u2019s so great and unique about retail: every center has a life of its own.\nHow are owners getting creative with these properties?\nEveryone kind of has their model of what they\u2019re looking for, but the properties that have a lot of daily traffic with restaurants and a little more life to it, those centers, tend to do pretty well, because you can obviously order food online, but if you want to go see your friends, you\u2019re going to go to dinner, and you\u2019re going to get out. So it brings life at night and at day. And it\u2019s good to have a center that has not only good daytime traffic, but also brings in a crowd at night.\n",

        "content": "La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, in the foothills of the San Gabriel Valley\u2019s Verdugo Mountains, is home to NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Descanso Gardens. It also contains the 1.3-acre site of a\nbattle over housing\nthat\u2019s become a case study for\nbuilder\u2019s remedy\n.\nThe state provision, which allows developers to circumvent local zoning in cities that have not mapped out plans for future housing development, gave Cedar Street Partners the leverage it needed to push a mixed-use development forward.\nAfter a Los Angeles judge ordered the city in March to post a\n$14 million bond\nin order to move forward on an appeal, La Ca\u00f1ada Mayor Mike Davitt said continuing the legal battle against Cedar Street\u2019s proposed five-story apartment-hotel-office project at 600 Foothill Boulevard was \u201cno longer in the best interest of the city.\u201d\nThe development calls for 7,200 square feet of office and roughly 80 dwelling units, of which eight are affordable and 16 are slated for hospitality.\nThe project\u2019s winding its way through city hall, and building plans are expected in six to eight months. The company is also looking to recover $6 million in costs related to the city\u2019s litigation against the project.\nCedar Street managing member Jonathan Curtis sits from an interesting perch as a developer and a former La Canada Flintridge City Councilmember from 2013 to 2024, even serving as its mayor for a one-year term. He sat down with\nThe Real Deal\nfor a conversation on the push and pull of housing development.\nHas the increased use of builder\u2019s remedy prompted any shift in attitudes about housing developments among communities that have pushed back?\nBuilder\u2019s remedy has definitely moved the needle. A number of jurisdictions realized that the games they\u2019ve played in the past to prevent housing will not work in the future. They\u2019ve come to realize that they need to do legitimate housing elements [required by the state].\nThe HCD, the Housing and Community Development Department of the state of California, reviews [housing elements] and is keeping closer tabs on what cities are doing as far as implementations. So, yes, I do think there\u2019s a shift in cities.\nAt the same time, if you were to contact various lawyers around town, you will find that they have more builder\u2019s remedy cases than they know what to do with. It\u2019s just certain cities that are bad actors, so to speak.\nGov. Gavin Newsom signed budget trailer bills in June paving the way for additional\nCalifornia Environmental Quality Act review exemptions\n. Similar bills have been proposed in the past. Why did they get so far this time?\nA fundamental change of attitude toward realizing that the lack of housing is affecting the economy. It affects health. It affects all sorts of things. It\u2019s a realization that we need to do something about housing. That\u2019s number one.\n\nNumber two, there\u2019s more of an acceptability of multifamily. It\u2019s a change in attitude. Everybody realizes it is affecting California significantly on many different fronts, and it costs more to deal with homelessness than it would if you dealt with it in a logical way.\nCEQA and other environmental laws are not being thrown out. They\u2019re being reined in to what they should have been for a long time.\nWhat might this shift in attitudes and policy changes mean for\nrebuilding\nplaces such as the Palisades and Altadena?\nThose exemptions under CEQA are for the entitlements to get a permit, but you still have building plans that have to be done.\nSo you\u2019ve got the permitting time. You\u2019ve got construction and construction inspections.\nRebuilding\u2019s got to be done on a holistic basis, because you could get your entitlements, or even if you\u2019re in the [Coastal Commission] zone, you could still sit there and wait a year for building plans. There\u2019s been efforts by the state, the county and the city to set up separate programs for rebuilding. The challenge on some of the rebuilding is you have a limitation as far as how much more you can build [back]. You can change a little bit, but you can\u2019t change it too much. What you\u2019re losing there is other [development] opportunities.\nDoes Cedar Street have interest in going into any of the communities impacted by the fires for possible development?\nWe would probably prefer doing mixed use as opposed to pure retail. I think retail can be a tough one, at least in Altadena, just because you need the critical mass. But which one comes first? It\u2019s really hard to tell.\nWhat other challenges face the development community right now?\nTariffs. But we don\u2019t know where tariffs are going to go because they keep changing.\nThere\u2019s also financing with the higher interest rates, it\u2019s more difficult, both on the construction financing as well as permanent financing. There\u2019s talk of two rate cuts, so that could potentially help things.\nWe also still face the attitude a lot of cities have, despite what the laws are, in pushing back [against development].\n",

        "content": "Colliers International Group is doubling down on multifamily and planting deeper roots in Texas with its latest acquisition.\nThe global brokerage\nacquired\nDallas-based Greystone Sales Group, also known as GREA Dallas, a 25-person multifamily investment sales team led by Todd Franks, Bisnow\nreported\n. The firm represents private and institutional investors across the country. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nThe move is part of a mergers and acquisitions binge that helped Colliers post a strong second quarter. The company snapped up Canadian engineering firm Higher Ground Consulting and Chicago-based Terra Consulting Group this spring, with acquisitions contributing $436 million in revenue \u2014 a 67 percent jump from last year.\nGreystone gives Colliers more firepower in the multifamily space where Dallas-Fort Worth is one of the\nbusiest\nmarkets in the country, said Gil Borok, Colliers U.S. president and CEO. Borok cited strong economic fundamentals, population growth and investment activity as top reasons Colliers is focused on North Texas as part of its national multifamily capital markets strategy.\n\nThe Metroplex had nearly 47,000 units under construction halfway through the year and another 18,000 scheduled for delivery by mid-2026, according to Colliers. That pipeline ranks DFW second nationally behind only New York City, according to RentCafe. With the region on track to surpass Chicago as the nation\u2019s third-largest metro area by 2030 \u2014 more than 450 new residents arrive daily, according to the U.S. Census Bureau \u2014 the appetite for more\nmultifamily\nunits has been steady, even with higher borrowing costs.\nThe acquisition demonstrates how population gains in North Texas are bolstering more than just apartments. Retail leasing has rebounded, hotel development is picking up, and even the sluggish office market has seen stabilizing demand. For Colliers, the Dallas foothold is as much about\ncapturing\nfuture growth as it is about immediate deal flow.\nIt\u2019s not yet clear whether the Greystone team will relocate from its 5728 LBJ Freeway office to Colliers\u2019 Uptown Dallas home at the 17Seventeen tower on McKinney Avenue. Either way, the brokerage now has another flag planted in a hot multifamily battleground.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Morgan Wealth Management \u2014 snagged a six-bedroom townhouse at\n171 East 73rd Street\nfor $12.1 million. The seller was an LLC tied to\nOwen Tunney\n, an investment professional, and\nJennifer Frame-Tunney\n, a managing director at BlackRock, that paid $6.4 million for the home in 2012. The five-story home has four outdoor spaces, heated sidewalks, a gym and elevator. The property\u2019s most recent asking price was $13.5 million.

An affiliate of\nPamera North America\npicked up a nine-story building at\n640 Broadway\nfor $49.5 million. The seller was an affiliate of\nAcadia Realty Trust\n, which bought the property, also known as\n172 Crosby Street\n, in 2012 for $32.5 million via a joint venture with Winhaven Group. The building\u2019s retail space spans just over 11,000 square feet, and the residential portion, with 21 units, covers about 42,000 square feet. Acadia once planned to convert the property into a\nresidential condominium\n. JLL\u2019s\nSteven Rutman\nand\nJeffrey Julien\nhad the\nlisting\n.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nIn Washington Heights, a stalled construction site at\n4452 Broadway\nand an adjacent lot at\n44 Fairview Avenue\nsold for $15.3 million. The seller was\nMadison Realty Capital\n, which took over the sites in 2024 through a bankruptcy sale from HAP Investments for $26.5 million. The latest transaction marks a 42 percent drop from its previous trade price. The newest owner is a Clifton, New Jersey-based LLC tied to\nThree Pillars\n. HAP had planned to build a 129-unit, seven-story apartment complex at the site, but the project remains unfinished.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nThe\nCatholic Near East Welfare Association\nshed a church property at\n248 East 62nd Street\nin Lenox Hill for $9.7 million.

The Soles purchased the Greenwich Village home in 2011 for $5.7 million. The property dates to 1844 and has some 4,300 square feet of living space, which includes five bedrooms and a chef\u2019s kitchen.

        "content": "What do Comptroller Brad Lander and President Donald Trump have in common?\nI\u2019m sure if I asked Lander, whom I have known since he ran the nonprofit Fifth Avenue Committee in Park Slope from 1993 to 2003, he would say, \u201cAbsolutely nothing.\u201d\nBut there is one thing, actually: Both proposed declaring a housing emergency so they could take steps not otherwise possible to improve affordability.\nLander did so during his Democratic primary campaign for mayor, in which he finished third behind Zohran Mamdani and Andrew Cuomo. Then Scott Bessent, Trump\u2019s treasury secretary, said early this month that the administration\nmight declare a housing emergency\nthis fall.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out what we can do, and we don\u2019t want to step into the business of states, counties and municipal governments,\u201d Bessent said.\nThat\u2019s an unfortunate caveat. Without fixing local zoning, regulation and sludge that drives up housing prices, a Trump emergency declaration would produce little besides a day\u2019s worth of headlines.\n\u201cOverriding, or at least standardizing, local laws on zoning would be a great step toward allowing builders to deliver the inventory needed by the American people,\u201d Realtor.com senior economist Joel Berner told Newsweek.\nLander\u2019s emergency would have helped him \u201ctake certain executive actions to, for example, increase funding for housing-focused agencies and eliminate time-consuming budget office reviews of certain affordable housing deals,\u201d the New York Times\nreported\n.\nHe also proposed letting certain projects\nskip Ulurp\n, the public review process that takes five to seven months, and instead go through a 90-day review. But he would have first formed a committee to decide what kind of projects would qualify. Lander\u2019s preamble would surely have taken many months.\nNeedless to say, Lander doesn\u2019t want Trump to declare a housing emergency because he doubts Trump would put any new powers to good use. In a statement to\nThe Real Deal\n, Lander said Trump\u2019s policies so far have been bad for housing.\n\u201cHis erratic tariff policies and cruel mass deportation regime are driving up the costs of building new homes,\u201d Lander said. \u201cHe\u2019s cut housing subsidies and proposed to eliminate far more. He\u2019s declared war on America\u2019s cities and deprived them of funds. And Project 2025 calls for opposing any efforts to weaken single-family zoning, the biggest single impediment to denser housing construction.\u201d\n\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nGoldman Copeland principal Daniel Colombini engineered his\nown home\u2019s construction\nin Westchester County, spending $300 per square foot, or 8 percent more than traditional construction would have cost, to achieve passive house standards \u2014 a cost that energy savings will make up in 10 to 15 years. But he says the indoor air quality has already cured his allergy-induced asthma. Do you plan to build or buy a passive house? Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Home refinancing is coming back as interest rates decline along with the number of homes that still have pre-2022, low-rate mortgages. Over the past year, about 42 percent of home loans were refis. Last week, 49 percent were, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 A new Public Policy Polling survey shared with\nCity &amp; State\nshows Zohran Mamdani leading the New York City mayoral race with 39 percent of the vote, ahead of Andrew Cuomo at 25 percent. That lead is smaller than other recent polls, like a recent Times/Siena poll that found Mamdani at 46 percent.\n\u2014 Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s decision to scale back New York\u2019s Essential Plan could cut off free government health insurance for about 450,000 New Yorkers,\nGothamist\nreported. It would reverse last year\u2019s expansion that raised the income eligibility limit for the Essential Plan to 250 percent of the federal poverty level (the limit had been 200 percent). Hochul blamed the rollback on federal funding cuts, saying that the move will allow for emergency funds to safeguard coverage for most of the 1.7 million current enrollees.\n\u2014 The Adams administration is advancing a plan for Related Companies to keep operating Central Park\u2019s Wollman Rink, sidelining the Trump Organization\u2019s bid to retake the concession, according to\nThe City\n. The Parks Department has sent Related\u2019s bid to the city Department of Investigation for a required background check.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$12.1 million\nfor a 7,100-square-foot townhouse at 171 East 73rd Street on the Upper East Side. Chase Landow of Serhant had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$49.5 million\nfor a 53,439-square-foot, nine-story, mixed-use property at 640 Broadway in Noho. Acadia Realty sold the building to German investor Pamera North America.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$21.5 million\nfor a 6,000-square-foot co-op unit at 895 Park Avenue in Lenox Hill. John Burger of Brown Harris Stevens has the listing.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "\u201cThe math ain\u2019t mathing,\u201d said Chris Tourtellote, managing director at Marina Del Rey-based LaTerra Development, on developing new apartment buildings in the City of Los Angeles.\nThat sums up the seeming political impetus for a\nstate bill\nthat is eligible for a floor vote today after 11 p.m., which could relax the transfer taxes as outlined in United to House LA measure, aka Measure ULA.\n\u201cYou build for $100 million, sell it for $105 million and pay $5.5 million in taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tax should be on your profit, not on your sale price. It makes it tough in a city that already has high development impact fees and affordability requirements, and even construction costs are higher and interest rates are higher.\u201d\nIn order to side step hefty tax bills\u00a0 via Measure ULA after building and then selling a new development, LaTerra is pursuing development in cities in California and elsewhere that are not subject to the \u201cmansion tax.\u201d\nThe firm is looking in Burbank \u2014 where LaTerra opened a 573-unit project in Burbank on Aug. 1 \u2014 as well as in San Diego, Orange County and Riverside because the mansion tax is not in effect there, Tourtellote said.\nSean Burton, CEO of Cityview, headquartered in Los Angeles, said his firm is actively developing around the country.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been focused on L.A. because of ULA,\u201d he said.\nThe one exception is a project that has been in the works since 2021: Cityview\u2019s 489-unit 6136 West Manchester Avenue, which received\nCity Council approval\nin May. The eight-story, 489-unit project is expected to break ground in 2026 and be complete in late 2028.\n\u201cCalifornia obviously already has a housing crisis,\u201d Burton said. \u201cLos Angeles has a housing crisis, and this tax is exacerbating it.\u201d\nDevelopment in L.A. only works if you have a good land basis, can build above-grade parking and can capture high rents, according to Tourtellote.\nLaTerra has two projects that fit that bill \u2014 4112 Del Rey Avenue in Marina Del Rey and 2311 North Hollywood Way in Burbank.\nLess building\nMeasure ULA was approved by L.A. voters in 2022 and went into effect in the city in April 2023 to fund homeless initiatives. It imposes a 4 percent tax on property sales over $5 million, and 5.5 percent on those above $10 million.\n\u201cThe idea was not to significantly reduce market-rate and affordable housing production,\u201d Tourtellote said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what anybody wants, right? But that\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\u201d\nSo far this year, the City of Los Angeles issued fewer permits for new apartment buildings with\nfive\nor more units year-over-year, dropping from 157 developments with 7,609 units in 2023 to 122 buildings comprising 5,156 units in 2024 to 90 buildings with 3,704 units through Aug. 31, according to an analysis by\nThe Real Deal\nof new building permits issued by the city for the last five years.\nMeasure ULA is a \u201cmajor factor\u201d contributing to the slowdown in permits, Drachman said. \u201cIt has driven up the cost of building anything since the tax is so punitive given it\u2019s a tax on a transfer, not profits.\u201d\nThat slowdown is colliding with the city\u2019s already daunting housing mandate to plan for the construction of 456,643 new housing units between 2021 and 2029.\n\nPaul Schon, founder of Hollywood-based Schon Development Group (formerly Schon Tepler), said his firm is not developing because it\u2019s \u201cso expensive\u201d between construction costs, high interest rates and Measure ULA.\nInstead, the firm is building accessory dwelling units on firm-owned properties and acquiring value-add, multifamily properties like the 21-unit Mar Vista Lofts at 3992 Inglewood Boulevard in Mar Vista it nabbed for $9 million in December.\n\u201cInterest rates put a shock to the environment across the nation \u2026 but then what really hammered it down was the mansion tax for the city of Los Angeles,\u201d Schon said.\nFor the tides to turn, Schon said it would take massive rent hikes or a significant drop in interest rates. The Federal Reserve first hiked interest rates in March 2022 in response to rising inflation.\nWhat\u2019s old is new\nLaTerra Development is also acquiring existing apartment buildings.\n\u201cRight now you can buy new apartment buildings for less than it costs to build,\u201d Tourtellote said.\nWaterford Property Company\u2019s John Drachman shared a similar sentiment about Measure ULA\u2019s impact.\n\u201cSpecifically for the City of Los Angeles it makes absolutely no sense to be building projects when it\u2019s a lot cheaper to buy existing projects,\u201d said Drachman, co-founder of the Newport Beach-based multifamily development firm. \u201cIf you look at recent trades in places around the city, newer projects are selling for far cheaper than what it would cost to replace.\u201d\nGovernment hand\nAt the state level,\nchanges\nwere made in July to the California Environmental Quality Act, or CEQA \u2014 enacted in 1970 to balance environmental protection and development but believed to be an effective tool at slowing or stopping development. The changes essentially cut red tape for many multifamily and single-family housing developments.\nThat alone is not the complete solution to the housing crisis.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about CEQA,\u201d Tourtellote said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice, but if the deal doesn\u2019t work and you can\u2019t find the investors, it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d\nSome significant changes to Measure ULA could be on the way.\nA bill published late Tuesday and slated for a vote by the State Assembly and State Senate Friday night calls for the reduction of the transfer tax on new multifamily, commercial and industrial construction to 1.5 percent for the first 15 years. It also exempts the rebuilding of single-family homes destroyed in natural disasters from the transfer tax for five years.\n\u201cIt would really help spur investment in new projects,\u201d Burton said of the legislation co-authored by Sen. Lena Gonzalez and Assembly member Tina McKinnon.\n",

        "content": "Los Angeles\u2019 infamous \u201cTrash House,\u201d previously freed of debris and detritus, is once again covered in garbage.\nA year after residents in the Fairfax District complained about piles of trash at a home on Martel Avenue, it has once again started to pile up at the so-called \u201cTrash House,\u201d KTLA\nreported\n. The brown, Spanish-style stucco home at 617 North Martel Avenue has been a lightning rod of criticism from neighbors for more than a year.\nIt started in April of last year when neighbors first complained about smelly plastic bags that had been piling up in front of the home for months.\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know what\u2019s in that, so it could be anything,\u201d one resident told KTLA at the time. \u201cProbably stuff rotting, attracting rats and all sorts of things\u2026 And if something happens to his house or him inside, no one can get in.\u201d\nThe home is occupied by 71-year-old Vietnam War veteran Raymond Gaon. While some neighbors have described him as a \u201cnice man,\u201d the issue of compiling trash had been brewing for years. After the property gained notable attention last year, his sister explained that Gaon is autistic and makes his money by recycling.\nAt the time, the property attracted the attention of local Councilwoman Katy Yaroslavsky, Mayor Karen Bass and even a producer of the TV series \u201cHoarders,\u201d the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n. Sanitation workers cleaned up the property and found a variety of objects underneath the rubble, including a Toyota car.\n\u201cThis is a fire hazard, and I worry about the individual there, this place catching fire, him losing his life,\u201d Bass said last year. \u201cThis is just outrageous, and it will end today.\u201d\n\nNow, with trash piling up at the home once again, Yaroslavsky has taken notice, issuing a statement yesterday about the growing problem.\n\u201cNeighbors have lived with a health and safety hazard for far too long and it is completely unacceptable. Our office has pushed [the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety], the City Attorney, and the County for more than a year, flagged every complaint from neighbors, and demanded updates on every court hearing,\u201d she said. \u201cThis case shows how slow and fragmented the system is.\u201d\nSome neighbors and friends have come to Gaon\u2019s defense, however.\n\u201cIf he was homeless, nobody would be pointing a camera in his face and trying to record him or his living situation,\u201d Paul Wilson, a neighbor who lives across the street, told the L.A. Times.\nThe mess is organized chaos for his recycling business, according to Tonya Lee Jaymes, a friend of Gaon\u2019s who helps people with hoarding problems.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a one-man operation, and this is how he makes his money,\u201d Jaynes said. \u201cHe\u2019s not bothering.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The last record holder,\n1800 The Strand\n, was sold last July and has claimed the record title each of the three times it has gone on the market.\nBefore 1800 The Strand, the last record for Manhattan Beach was 1000 The Strand, a corner-lot property that sold in 2017 for $21 million.\nHomes in Manhattan Beach traded for a median price of $3.1 million in July, according to Redfin data.

        "content": "Gov. J.B. Pritzker is putting a price tag on the Chicago Bears\u2019 suburban ambitions: more than half a billion dollars in debt tied to Soldier Field renovations.\nThe governor said this week that before lawmakers consider the property tax break the team is\nseeking\nfor its Arlington Heights stadium plan, the Bears will need to deal with the $534 million still owed on Soldier Field\u2019s 2003 renovation, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\n\u201cWe need the Bears to pay off what\u2019s owed on the existing stadium,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cIf they want a PILOT [payment-in-lieu-of-taxes] bill, or some other help, we\u2019re going to make that a prerequisite.\u201d\nThe team has been\nlobbying\nSpringfield for a payment-in-lieu-of-taxes law that would let megaproject developers negotiate fixed annual payments instead of facing regular property tax assessments. The proposal would apply statewide but is central to the Bears\u2019 $5 billion vision for Arlington Heights, where Kevin Warren, president of the team\u2019s organization, has said they hope to start construction this year. Without legislation, the project is stalled, Warren said.\nThe debt complicates things. Soldier Field\u2019s bonds are backed by a hotel tax and annual city and state subsidies, with shortfalls covered by Chicago\u2019s share of state tax revenue. Even if the Bears leave, they aren\u2019t directly tied to repayment. But as debt service ramps up over the next decade, the cost of walking away without a plan would land on taxpayers \u2014 a sticking point for legislators already wary of another stadium bailout.\nThe Bears\u2019 lease with the Park District runs through 2033, but the team has signaled it could try to exit earlier, citing frustration over maintenance. Terminating the lease would require a fee, which shrinks each year, but it wouldn\u2019t come close to erasing Soldier Field\u2019s debt.\n\nPritzker has\nopposed\nusing state dollars to fund stadium construction in the past, though he\u2019s left the door\nopen\nto infrastructure support. He\u2019s also made clear his preference for keeping the Bears in the city, but stopped short of tying state assistance to location.\n\u201cThey\u2019re a private business. They can go wherever they would like to go,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would like them to stay in the city of Chicago.\u201d\nLawmakers, meanwhile, aren\u2019t convinced. State Rep. Kam Buckner said the governor\u2019s stance reflects growing pressure to make the Bears address \u201cunfinished business\u201d before Springfield helps them move.\n\u201cLeaving the city high and dry without having a way to address that debt is the wrong thing to do,\u201d Buckner said.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

New York-based Westbrook Partners was the seller.\nThe deal for the 123,577-square-feet structure works out to $159.41 per square foot. Westbrook Partners bought Stadium Centre from Guggenheim Services, another New York-based firm, in 2018 for $28.8 million, or $233.05 per square foot, according to the Business Journal.\nThe property rises six stories at 2099 South State College Boulevard near Angel Stadium. Tenants at the building include Anaheim Visitors Bureau and Rexel USA, according to the Business Journal. The structure was built in 1985 and is located in Anaheim\u2019s Platinum Triangle mixed-use district, which features residences, restaurants and retail near the Angels\u2019 ballpark.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest office building near Angel Stadium to trade hands in recent months.\nIn June, Henry and Susan Samueli, owners of the Anaheim Ducks, bought the Stadium Tower office building next to the team\u2019s home rink at the\nHonda Center\n. CBRE Investment Management and CalSTRS sold the 261,939-square-foot property at 2400 East Katella Avenue for $72.1 million, or about $275 per square foot. CBRE and CalSTRS previously bought the tower in 2017 for $63.9 million.\nThat acquisition is purportedly part of the Samuelis\u2019 ongoing expansion plan in the area around the two sports venues known as OCVibe. The megadevelopment, projected to cost $4 billion, calls for 100 acres of multifamily buildings, two hotels, a 50,000-square-foot food hall, two live event venues and office and retail spaces, according to\nForbes\n.\nIn addition to commercial properties such as the Stadium Centre office building, San Francisco-based Baco holds retail, self-storage and single-family properties in its\nportfolio\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The population of Leander grew by 7,000 people, representing a 9 percent increase and outpacing second-place Georgetown by 2,400 people. Austin grew by 4,000 people, or 0.4 percent, as the city\u2019s Big Tech-propelled growth of\na few years ago\nhas flagged.\n\nPound for pound, the fastest-growing city in the Austin area was the southwestern town of Dripping Springs, where an increase of 1,500 people grew the population by 17 percent.\nSome agents are calling Austin a\nbuyer\u2019s market\n, especially certain submarkets such as\ncondos\nand luxury homes. Selling a home appears to be easier in the suburbs, however.\n\u201cThe whole market is going through a kind of right-sizing, if you will,\u201d Havel said.\nTri Pointe\u2019s planned developments, named Ridgeview Reserve and Noven, will comprise one- and two-story homes of 3,500 to 4,400 square feet of space on 70-foot lots. Ridgeview Reserve, expected to accommodate 42 homes, will go up next to Rouse High School at Raider Way and Woodview Drive, roads the city recently finished improving with crosswalks and bike lanes. Noven, expected to include 108 homes, is less than 3 miles away on County Road 177.\n",

        "content": "Fort Lauderdale is attempting to find a developer for its new city hall, two years after the former government center was damaged in a flood from a historic rainstorm.\nSix groups filed proposals to build a new city hall at 100 North Andrews Avenue, with some of the applications proffering two or more alternative designs.\nThe previous eight-story, Brutalist-style gray concrete building with a fortress-like appearance was completed in 1969.\nIn 2023, record rainfall led to floods in\nFort Lauderdale\n, with water pouring into the former city hall building\u2019s basement. The building was demolished in November and staff has been working in leased space elsewhere.\nIn May, Meridiam Infrastructure North America, the builder of the\nPortMiami Tunnel\nand an affiliate of Paris-based global investment and asset manager Meridiam, filed an unsolicited proposal to partner with the city on a new city hall. Under a state law requirement, the city opened the opportunity for other developers to submit competing applications by Aug. 5.\nHere is an inside look at what each group proposes:\nBalfour\u2019s three options\nMalvern, Pennsylvania-based Balfour Beatty, a global infrastructure firm, offered three options designed by\nKobi Karp\nand DLR Group. Costs for the proposals aren\u2019t listed.\nThe first option is a 250,000-square-foot city hall with a library and a small commercial space. The second option adds additional floors for lease to retailers and office users other than the city. And the third option is a large campus consisting of one of the first two options plus another building with residential or commercial uses, the filing shows.\nThe proposal shows a target completion date of mid-2028.\nMeridiam\u2019s three options\nMeridiam outlines three Zyscovich-designed options.\nThe firm\u2019s largest proposal is for a 12-story, 340,000-square-foot building with a podium of up to three stories with services such as child care, a wellness center and a gallery.\nAlternatively, Meridiam also outlines a baseline proposal for a seven-story, 200,000-square-foot city hall with a two-story podium with \u201climited shared spaces,\u201d the filing shows.\nThe middle ground option is for a 10-story, 275,000-square-foot building with a podium of up to three stories. Under this proposal, the commission chambers and the common areas will be smaller than in the firm\u2019s largest city hall option, the filing shows.\nThe estimated project capital expenditures will range from $172 million to $292 million, according to the proposal.\nCompletion of the commission chambers is expected in late 2028, with the full project buildout expected in 2029.\nFort Lauderdale Civic Hall Partnership\n\nA consortium of firms that includes Melbourne, Australia-based Plenary Group as the project developer and lead equity partner, proposes an oval-shaped, 10-story city hall.\nDesigned by Palma and PGAL architecture firms, the building would span 196,000 square feet, according to the proposal.\nCompletion would be in late 2028. The project is estimated to cost $280 million.\nFort Lauderdale Beacon Collaborative\nGilbane Development Company proposes an\nArquitectonica\n-designed building, with its most notable feature a wave-like awning.\nProvidence, Rhode Island-based Gilbane wants to build a 229-foot tall building, with its proposal emphasizing hurricane-proof windows, energy efficiency and public spaces. The expected completion is in 2027.\nV. Industry Grade Construction Group\nThe proposal doesn\u2019t identify an architect or list the project\u2019s height or square footage. It lists an expected completion in 2028 and a fully private financing structure that will require no upfront city expenditure.\nVI. Cypress West\nCypress West, an entity led by Sheldon Gross of Hillsboro Beach, proposes a new government center with two campuses.\nThe city\u2019s back office operations would be at a North Operations Campus at 1515 West Cypress Creek Road in Fort Lauderdale, a building on which Cypress West has the leasehold and that\u2019s currently used by the Fort Lauderdale Police Department. The building is in an X flood zone, which designates areas least exposed to flood risk.\nThe second portion of the campus would be a new, roughly 100,000-square-foot building at 100 North Andrews Avenue. The final design, size and other features would be determined collaboratively with the city.\n\u201cRather than offering a one-size-fits-all financing approach, our development team will work collaboratively with [the city] to explore various financing structures,\u201d the application says.\nThis proposal also projects a 2028 completion.\n",

        "content": "Austin leaders are moving to create a housing fund aimed at preserving existing affordable apartments, a tool they hope can slow the pace of displacement in one of the nation\u2019s hottest housing markets.\nThe Austin City Council is moving to establish a fund that would attract philanthropic contributions to keep naturally occurring affordable housing from being sold off and demolished, KXAN\nreported\n. Council Member Marc Duchen, who proposed the measure, said the effort is meant to counter the unintended consequences of incentive programs like DB 90, which lets developers build taller in exchange for affordable units but can still lead to a net loss of affordability when existing low-rent properties are torn down.\nOne flashpoint has been the Acacia Cliffs complex, where demolition of older affordable units made way for a taller building that technically met DB 90\u2019s requirements but displaced longtime tenants.\nCity officials envision the fund offering property owners grants for repairs in exchange for\naffordability\ncovenants. That model could preserve units without forcing owners to sell to developers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily buying down the rent,\u201d said Eric Johnson, assistant city manager. \u201cIt\u2019s saying to an owner, without disrupting the market, \u2018We have a grant source we could provide to you to do the capital improvements in exchange for a covenant on the property to guarantee affordability.\u2019\u201d\n\nJohnson previously helped launch a similar fund in Dallas in 2021. That effort began with $6 million in seed funding and has since grown to more than $40 million, with another $60 million in the pipeline, backed by private and banking sector contributions. The Dallas Housing Opportunity Fund has a target of preserving or producing at least 1,500 affordable units by 2031.\nIn Austin, officials expect the money to flow toward three areas: grants for repairs, low-cost financing for new affordable development, and\nservices\nfor residents. But they acknowledge a looming challenge \u2014 competing with private developers who can move faster to acquire aging complexes and redevelop them.\nIt also might be difficult to make the math work for landlords struggling with\nkeeping\nheads in beds. Oversupply of multifamily units has meant higher vacancies. Apartment occupancy dipped to 85 percent in August, with rents sliding 7.5 percent year-over-year to an average of $1,405, according to\nApartmentData.com\n. In 2023, rent\ndipped\n12.5 percent from its 2021-22 highmarks, but many renters still find the city unaffordable.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s only mid-September, but Greenwich has already seen a record volume of luxury home sales for the year.\nThere have been 25 home sales in the tony Connecticut town for more than $10 million as of the end of August, according to data compiled by Compass agent Mark Pruner and\nreported\nby\u00a0 Bloomberg.\nFor all of last year, there were 17 home sales at the same price threshold. The 25 sales this year are the most recorded for the market since 1999, and are on pace to double last year\u2019s total.\nPruner cited the stock market and uncertainty surrounding\nNew York City\u2019s impending mayoral election\nfor the \u201caccelerating\u201d activity in the market.\nOne of the biggest obstacles holding back home sales across the nation,\nelevated mortgage rates\n, does little to daunt buyers of high-end homes.\nPruner estimated there could be $597 million worth of trophy home sales in Greenwich for the full year. That would shatter the previous record of $314 million, which was set two years ago.\n\nThe market has seen sales this year that exceed $10 million by leaps and bounds. A 27,000-square-foot manor sold for $43.5 million, while a waterfront mansion that is less than half the size of that manor is in contract after asking $43 million.\nThe home at 214 Clapboard Ridge Road sold for more than $43 million last month after originally listing for $55 million. The buyers agreed to the purchase 42 days after the luxury home hit the market.\nMichele Tesei, an agent with Houlihan Lawrence in the area, told Bloomberg inherited wealth appeared to also be playing a role in the market\u2019s increased activity, with multiple couples under 40 visiting the listing at 214 Clapboard Ridge Road.\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m dealing with a high-end luxury property, I always advise the seller not to expect a quick sale \u2014 they have to be prepared for the house to be on the market for 200 to 365 days,\u201d said Tesei. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen sales way quicker than that.\u201d\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A New York City-based real estate attorney is suing celebrity broker Ryan Serhant, alleging he jilted her of her full referral commission in a Fisher Island deal with Stoli Vodka billionaire Yuri Shefler.\nThe attorney, Natalia Sishodia, is demanding $455,000 and a jury trial, court documents show. According to the complaint and an attachment, Sishodia signed a referral agreement with Serhant, whose firm brokered the sale of the Fisher Island home, in April 2024.\nSishodia, who heads her namesake firm in New York City, alleges that Serhant owed her 25 percent of the $840,000 gross commission, which equates to $210,000. She alleges he only paid her $105,000, citing an amended agreement. Her complaint, filed in July in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in New York County, names Serhant and seven of his companies as defendants.\nThe $455,000 accounts for the additional $105,000 Sishodia claims she is owed, as well as $350,000 in damages.\nAttorneys for Sishodia declined to comment. Serhant\u2019s attorney, Andrew Lieb, in an email confirmed the broker is seeking to dismiss the case and \u201cwill let the papers speak for themselves.\u201d\n\nThe dispute revolves around Shefler\u2019s\n$21 million\npurchase of the home at 6915 Valencia Drive on\nFisher Island\nin Miami Beach in December. Serhant agent Mariana Niro represented both the buyer and the seller in the deal for the 9,400-square-foot mansion, one of just a few single-family homes on the private island.\nShefler\u2019s affiliation to the purchase was revealed in the legal filings and has not been previously reported. The Russian-born vodka magnate has a $1.1 billion net worth, according to Forbes. He heads SPI Group and its Luxembourg-based subsidiary, Stoli Group, the maker of the vodka of the same name and several other liquor brands.\nIn 2015, Shefler sold his 440-foot superyacht, Serene, to Prince Mohammed bin Salman for $550 million, the\nNew York Times\nreported. In 2022, he bought Angelina Jolie\u2019s share in the French Ch\u00e2teau Miraval vineyard for $28.4 million, according to published reports. The sale angered her ex-husband and Miraval co-owner Brad Pitt, who is suing Jolie for $67 million over the deal, according to published reports.\nThe sale to Shefler marked a win for\nSerhant\n, who only expanded to South Florida in 2023. His growth efforts have been dogged by legal battles \u2013\u2013 that year, Palm Beach Gardens-based\nSutter &amp; Nugent sued Serhant Florida\n, alleging the brokerage stole trade secrets. That suit was\ndismissed\nin April.\nSince then, he landed top Palm Beach agent Gary Pohrer and\nopened an office on the island\n. He\u2019s also orchestrating the purchase of\na $350 million-plus oceanfront assemblage\nin Palm Beach linked to Microsoft billionaire Charles Simonyi.",
