        "content": "Here we go.\nMayor Zohran Mamdani\u2019s first week in office\nhas been eventful\nfor the real estate industry, to say the least. With the start of the state legislative session and the first meeting of the new City Council, things are about to get more interesting.\nAs expected, Julie Menin was elected City Council speaker during the Council\u2019s first meeting. Top of mind is whether she will move to override former Mayor Eric Adams\u2019\nvetoes\nof the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act and a trio of housing regulation bills. Menin has said the Council is considering its options.\nIn her first address as speaker, Menin said the City Council will release its own housing plan looking for opportunities to redevelop the city\u2019s libraries to also include housing (as was done with the Sunset Park library) and to build on city-owned land.\nDuring her speech, Menin also noted that the first Muslim mayor and first Jewish speaker of the Council are serving at the same time.\n\u201cThis moment truly is historic,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what will write this interfaith leadership into the history books is if it can act as an opportunity for all of us to come together \u2014 to calm tensions, to bridge divides and to recognize we are one city, no matter the religion we practice or the language we speak.\u201d\nIn Albany, the legislative session kicked off Wednesday, and in less than a week, Gov. Kathy Hochul is expected to lay out her agenda in the State of the State. Hochul is up for re-election and is going to face pressure on the left to support tax increases on the state\u2019s wealthiest, which is key to funding Mamdani\u2019s key campaign promises. She\u2019s also up against a Republican challenger likely to emphasize the need to stop the new mayor\u2019s agenda.\nIndustry folks don\u2019t seem to have a lot of\nhope\nthat changes to 485x are on the table this year. Landlord groups have previously pushed for legislation that would allow one-time rent resets on vacant stabilized apartments, though lawmakers have shown little appetite to do so. Mamdani has voiced support for property tax reform and alternative insurance models, though, as ways to address owner costs.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill Hochul include anything about property tax reform or other measures to address operating costs in rent-stabilized buildings? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nOpen New York is pushing back against the Landmarks Preservation Commission\u2019s recent designation of Beverley Square West and Ditmas Park West as historic districts. The Yimby group argues that the designations unfairly exempt the areas from the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity. The designations await review by City Planning and City Council approval.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\nChristina Cover, a public school teacher and DSA member, is considering running for Assembly District 84 in the South Bronx\n,\nCity &amp; State reports\n. Assembly member Amanda Septimo, who currently represents the district, is challenging Rep. Ritchie Torres.\n\u2014\nAs part of her State of the State priorities, which will be announced next week, Gov. Kathy Hochul will propose new restrictions on 3D-printed guns and other illegal firearms\n,\nSpectrum News reports\n.\n\u2014\nAnd in news that was not on my bingo card, President Donald Trump\nannounced\nWednesday that he plans to block institutional investors from buying up single-family homes.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$9.1 million\nat 56 Crosby Street. The Soho condo unit is 4,000 square feet. It last sold in 2010 for $4.4 million.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$237.5 million\nfor 1540 Broadway. Buyers BDT &amp; MSD Partners are\nreportedly\ninvesting $150 million in amenities packages for the 907,000-square-foot office building.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $18.5 million for 205 Clinton Street. The Cobble Hill townhouse is listed by\nCompass\u2019\nLindsay Barrett, Taylor Schultz and Christopher Mohr.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 68,813-square-foot, 13-story, mixed-use building at 7-45 Wyckoff Avenue in Ridgewood. Kao Hwa Lee Architects is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "\ud83c\udfc6 Residential:\nThe priciest residential real estate sale recorded in New York City was for a townhouse at\n22 East 68th Street\non the Upper East Side that changed hands for $10.5 million. The home stands four stories tall and measures just over 3,300 square feet, pricing the transaction at roughly $3,200 per square foot. The seller, an LLC named after the address, purchased the townhouse a decade ago for $12.6 million. The buyer in the latest deal was\nLDN Investments LLC.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nIn Hudson Square, a six-story office building at\n183 Varick Street\nsold for $63 million, marking the most expensive commercial deal recorded in the Big Apple. The buyer was an affiliate of\nAvdoo &amp; Partners Development\n, which entered contract to acquire the more than 68,000-square-foot property in March. The seller was an entity led by\nBenjamin Webster Federbush\n; the property has been connected to the Federbush family since at least the 1960s. The transaction pencils out to about $920 per square foot.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nAn affiliate of Pasadena, California-based\nAlexandria Real Estate Equities\noffloaded an office property at\n30-02 48th Avenue\nin Long Island City for $34.5 million \u2014 54 percent lower than its prior trade price. The buyer was New York-based\nNorth River Company.\nThe property stands three stories tall and spans more than 141,400 square feet. It was once a book bindery and Alexandria converted it into the Alexandria Center for Life Science. Alexandria had acquired the site for $75 million in 2018.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nThe Holiday Inn Express Manhattan Midtown West at\n538 West 48th Street\ntraded for $26.5 million. The seller was an LLC tied to real estate investor\nAndrew Roufail\n, and the buyer was hotelier\nMaheshchand Ratanji.\nRoufail\u2019s entity purchased the building in 2014 for $16.5 million. The hotel stands 11 stories tall and measures 61,700 square feet. The deal works out to about $430 per square foot.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Jesse Delia\nscooped up a condo at\n56 Crosby Street\nin Soho for $9.1 million.

Garfield\u2019s\nSophie Smadbeck, Richard Pretsfelder, Morgan Garofalo\nand\nMatt Lesser\nin September for $10.3 million.\nBy the Numbers:\nU.S. CRE debt hits $4.8T, with banks leading the way\nThrough the second quarter of 2025, outstanding commercial real estate debt in the U.S. hit $4.8 trillion, led by banks and thrifts and followed by government-sponsored enterprises.\nBanks and thrifts, such as credit unions, held nearly 38 percent of the country\u2019s commercial real estate debt, with a total of $1.83 trillion, according to an analysis of Federal Reserve data by research firm Trepp. GSEs, like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, followed, with some 22 percent of the market, totaling $1.08 trillion.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "DWS Group sold a two-building office complex in Coral Gables for $119.6 million, amid the firm\u2019s nationwide divestment from the asset class.\nDallas-based Lone Star Funds, Jay Caplin\u2019s Miami-based Square2 Capital and David Moret\u2019s Highline Real Estate Capital bought The Alhambra, consisting of the 14-story building at 2 Alhambra Plaza and the seven-story building at 95 Merrick Way, according to the buyers\u2019 news release. Lone Star Funds is led by Donald Quintin and John Grayken. Square2 and Highline are based in Miami.\nThe buyers obtained a $98.5 million loan from an entity tied to Rialto Capital Management. The debt consists of DWS\u2019 outstanding $58.3 million balance on its loan to a previous financier, which Rialto assumed, and an additional $40.2 million, according to records.\nThe deal comes amid a slow South Florida office market compared to the pandemic-induced boom fueled by an influx of out-of-state tenants and high valuations.\nThe 326,000-square-foot Alhambra is about 87 percent leased, the release says. The sale amounts to $367 per square foot.\nThe complex, completed in 1961 and 1987, spans a full city block. A Hyatt Regency Coral Gables Hotel sits between the two office buildings. The hotel wasn\u2019t part of the sale.\nSquare2 Management will manage the property.\nHermen Rodriguez and Mathew McCormack were part of the JLL team that represented DWS. A JLL team also secured the financing on behalf of the buyers.\nDWS, and its U.S. real estate subsidiary Rreef, have been shedding offices in recent years. It put The Alhambra on the market last summer with a target price of about\n$125 million\n.\nDWS, led by Americas CEO Hepsen Uzcan and Todd Henderson as head of real estate for the Americas, paid $118.6 million for The Alhambra in 2015, according to property records and the firm\u2019s website.\nHenderson told\nThe Real Deal\nlast summer that Rreef made a policy decision to divest from its\noffice portfolio nationwide\neven before the pandemic took a toll on occupancies.\nIn February, the firm sold two office properties in downtown Fort Lauderdale, also for minimal gains from what it paid for them. DWS sold Las Olas Centre I &amp; II, consisting of an 18-story building at 350 East Las Olas Boulevard and a 15-story building at 450 East Las Olas Boulevard, for\n$208 million\n. Chicago-based Bradford Allen Investment Advisors was the buyer. DWS paid $204 million for Las Olas Centre in 2014, records show.\nIn the same week, Rreef Property Trust sold the 23-story Bank of America Plaza at Las Olas City Centre at\u00a0 401 East Las Olas Boulevard for\n$221 million\n, also to Lone Star Funds\u2019 real estate fund VII, Highline Real Estate Capital and Square2 Capital. Rreef paid\n$220 million\nfor the property in 2016.\nNew-to-market firms are still leasing in South Florida, though fewer than the bonanza in the first three years of the pandemic. But office investment sales became scarcer amid higher interest rates and other elevated expenses such as insurance, widening bid-ask gaps and\nlowering property valuations\n.\nLandlords divesting from offices nationwide are more likely to sell in South Florida, where they can still sell for at least breakeven prices or for smaller losses than what they would record elsewhere in the U.S.,\nexperts have told TRD\n.\nAlso in Coral Gables, AEW Capital Management sold the 11-story Ryder Colonnade office building at 169 Coral Way to Fort Worth, Texas-based Crescent Real Estate for\n$70.4 million\nlast month. The deal marked a 13 percent discount from what AEW paid over a decade ago.\u00a0A tougher capital markets environment opened the door to all-cash buyers who can avoid taking out financing. In last year\u2019s top office deal, Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega paid\n$274.4 million\nin cash for the 30-story Sabadell Financial Center in Miami\u2019s Brickell.\n",

        "content": "Residents and business owners gathered Wednesday in the Pacific Palisades as they pointed the finger at local and state officials for bungling the recovery and prevention of last year\u2019s deadly\nwildfires\n.\nCalled the \u201cThey let us burn\u201d demonstration, it was held on the one-year anniversary of the\nPalisades and Eaton blazes\n, which damaged or destroyed some 16,000 residential and commercial structures across mostly Altadena, Pacific Palisades and parts of Malibu.\nWhile local and state officials have repeatedly pegged the recovery as the fastest in history, many residents and business owners are still grappling with delays in insurance claims, rising construction costs and a web of taxes and fees for rebuilding or selling off their lots. They\u2019re asking their government leaders for accountability in helping complete the recovery.\nAt least one public official was on hand to listen to speakers at the demonstration, with Los Angeles City Councilmember Traci Park taking to the podium at one point to criticize \u201cbotched evacuations\u201d and \u201cdry hydrants.\u201d\n\u201cWhat you all are asking for going forward is basic. It is reasonable and we shouldn\u2019t have to beg our government to make this right,\u201d Park, whose district includes the\nPalisades\n, told the crowd of hundreds.\nShe earned cheers when she allowed that \u201cof course, your permit fees should be waived,\u201d before criticizing speculators, saying \u201cdevelopers are circling like vultures, looking to profit by adding density.\u201d\nThe ire harbored by some could earn reality TV star Spencer Pratt, who lost his home to the Palisades Fire, some voter support as he announced his run for mayor of Los Angeles. He confirmed it while at the podium in a shock announcement that will pit \u201cThe Hills\u201d star against incumbent Mayor Karen Bass in a move that drew cheers from the crowd.\n\u201cI coped with [the fires] by eating burritos and putting every ounce of energy into uncovering the truth and the dirty facts I\u2019ve uncovered this year will completely blow you away,\u201d Pratt told the crowd. \u201cI used to think my taxpayer dollars funded a functional city and a state government whose infrastructure and essential services would be there when I needed them, but I was completely na\u00efve.\u201d\nPratt would be the latest political outsider looking to shake up city hall. His announcement follows Presbyterian minister\nRae Chen Huang\n\u2019s bid to also unseat Bass. Huang, a dues-paying member of the Democratic Socialists of America, announced her run in November. While seen as a longshot candidate, she\u2019s campaigning on a platform that includes affordable housing, free transit and addressing public safety through a boost in mental health services.\nOn repeat\nWhile many of the speakers focused on what went wrong a year ago, organizers of the demonstration also outlined 10 key moves seen as necessary for future prevention and shepherding a fast-tracked recovery.\nSome of the imperatives outlined overlap with calls residential agents and brokers made in the weeks after the fires were tamed\nlast year\n, including a stop on permit fees and temporary moratorium on the Measure United to House L.A. levy, or so-called mansion tax, in the city of Los Angeles. The rally organizers are calling for a five-year \u201cULA holiday\u201d on property sales that would normally be hit by the transfer tax, while those who penned the\nagent letter\nasked for an exemption for sellers impacted by the fires.\nThat initial call to action was led by the Oppenheim Group\u2019s Jason Oppenheim and The Agency\u2019s Ben Belack in a letter to Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California CEO Aaron Kirman, who was at the rally, was one of more than 45 agents and brokers who signed last year\u2019s letter.\n\u201cOne year later, the real failure isn\u2019t debris removal, it\u2019s rebuilding,\u201d Kirman said Wednesday. \u201cLeaders treated this like a press problem instead of a housing market crisis. That\u2019s why the five-year ULA holiday and eliminating taxes on rebuilds resonated so strongly. They confront the very policies slowing recovery.\u201d\nThe ULA tax, which has been a sore spot for residential and commercial real estate since going into effect in the spring of 2023, assesses a 4 percent tax on deals starting at $5.3 million and 5.5 percent on those of $10.6 million or more. Voters passed the tax as a 2022 ballot measure.\nIn October, Bass asked the city council to approve an ordinance giving the finance director power to grant a one-time exemption from Measure ULA to residential property owners impacted by the fires. That was followed up in November with the Ad Hoc Committee for LA Recovery\nrequesting a report\nin 30 days on the feasibility of such a carveout.\nSimilar consideration on the matter of permit fees is also winding its way through city hall.\nNourmand &amp; Associates\u2019 Rochelle Atlas Maize, a Beverly Hills-based agent who was also at the demonstration, said full suspension of permit fees is the demand she backs the most.\n\u201cThese homeowners aren\u2019t upgrading or speculating,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are replacing what was lost. Every added fee delays recovery, increases underinsurance risk and pushes families out permanently.\u201d\nLike Kirman, she also supports the temporary ULA suspension and offered that in an ideal situation, the tax would be permanently waived in any instance of disaster recovery.\nAtlas Maize has several clients that are \u201cfrozen\u201d from moving forward, whether that\u2019s due to insurance proceeds not covering construction costs, permit fees or other factors.\n\u201cThese are not isolated cases,\u201d she said. \u201cThey reflect a systemic problem where recovery costs are being shifted onto individual homeowners instead of shared as a public responsibility.\u201d\n",

But property records with more details on the purchasing company weren\u2019t available at the time.\nA recent Cook County deed shows the buyer is connected to Sony Pictures Entertainment, the U.S. media arm of the Tokyo-based media and electronics conglomerate. The deed also shows the sale included 16 of the\n37 condos Wanda owned\nat the building.\nThe transfer of the units at the 101-story, Jeanne Gang-designed skyscraper at 363 East Wacker Drive is the conclusion of a long-running legal fight which spilled into a United Kingdom court in 2024.\nIn 2017, Wanda\u2019s children\u2019s entertainment subsidiary purchased a 51 percent stake in Vampire Squid Productions, the holding company for the animated show \u201cOctonauts,\u201d from Silvergate, according to a Variety report from 2024.\nThe agreement stipulated the remaining share of Vampire Squid was subject to an option for Wanda to purchase at a later date, the publication reported. When Sony bought Silvergate in 2019, Sony exercised the option and valued the remaining 49 percent at $87.4 million.\nAfter disputes over the price, Sony sued Wanda in 2024, accusing it of neglecting its end of the deal. Last year, a UK judge ordered Wanda to pay Sony $49 million for the remaining 49 percent stake in the \u201cOctonauts\u201d property, ICLG News reported.\nRather than paying cash, Wanda agreed to a non-cash asset swap with Sony, according to a filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Wanda acquired the remaining 49 percent stake in Vampire Squid Productions while Sony\u2019s subsidiary took over the 16 residential units at the St. Regis.\nThe asset swap gives Wanda full rights to the \u201cOctonauts\u201d intellectual property globally until 2034 and in China until 2053, according to the filing.\nIt\u2019s unclear what Sony will do with the units. Downtown\nChicago condos have been a tough sell\nin recent years, but the St. Regis, which was completed in 2020, notched some of the highest prices downtown in 2025. The bulk price for Sony\u2019s acquisition comes out to an average of nearly $3 million per unit, but it includes an 89th floor unit likely worth much more.\nThat 6,000-square-foot condo never sold individually but was listed in 2019 for $11 million. It was taken off the for-sale market in 2020 but was listed for rent at $35,000 per month for much of 2025; it\u2019s unclear if it was ever leased but the rental listing was most recently removed from the market in November.\nSony Pictures Entertainment and Wanda Group did not respond to requests for comment.\nWang Jianlin\u2019s Wanda has had a long history at the St. Regis. The firm originally invested in the 101-story project in 2016 alongside Chicago-based Magellan Development Group, intending to debut its first U.S. hotel under the Wanda Vista brand. But after Chinese regulations on overseas investment tightened, Wanda sold its 90 percent stake to Magellan for $270 million in 2020.\nIn March, Wanda marketed the 37 condos it owned in the building as a bulk sale. The condos handed over to Sony came from that pool, property records show.\nIn 2024, Magellan sold its remaining 84 units to Denver-based GD Holdings for $117 million. GD holdings has been able to command high prices for the prime units in that portfolio: A 79th-floor penthouse sold for\n$7.5 million in September\n. In October, Siri co-founder\nDag Kittlaus\nbought an 84th-floor St. Regis penthouse for $9.25 million, property records show.\nThe priciest sale on record at the St. Regis came in 2022, when\nMexican mining executive German Larrea\npurchased a two-story, 10,000-square-foot penthouse spanning the 71st and 72nd floors for $20 million.\n",

        "content": "United States Steel Corporation\n\u2019s real estate arm purchased a former steel mill site in Pittsburg, California, for nine figures.\nU.S. Steel Property Holdings bought the plant site, which operated as a steel mill for decades until it closed two years ago, for $275 million, the Mercury News\nreported\n. The mill was formerly a 50-50 venture between U.S. Steel Corporation and South Korea-based steel company Posco. In 2020, U.S. Steel Corporation bought Posco\u2019s 50 percent share, placing ownership under U.S. Steel itself. The $275 million internal transfer moves ownership from U.S. Steel Corporation to U.S. Steel Property Holdings.\nThe property spans 11 parcels at addresses on Loveridge Road, East Third Street, Columbia Street, and Antioch-Pittsburg Highway in\nPittsburg\n. U.S. Steel Property Holdings acquired the site through a quitclaim deed, which transfers property ownership from a grantor to a grantee without any warranties or guarantees.\nIn December 2023, U.S. Steel indefinitely paused production at the plant in Pittsburg, halting all manufacturing of cold-rolled sheets, galvanized sheets, tinplate and tin-free steel. The shutdown coincided with the announcement that Japan-based Nippon Steel would be acquiring the company; in total, 474 workers at the plant lost their jobs. At the time operations were suspended, the factory was the West Coast\u2019s only producer of tin plates for the canning industry, as well as other products. Nippon Steel\u2019s purchase was completed last June.\nNippon Steel\u2019s purchase has appeared to revitalize some of the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based firm\u2019s growth efforts. Since Nippon Steel officially took ownership, U.S. Steel has announced plans for a large renovation at an Alabama plant, restarting a blast furnace at an Illinois plant and a revamp of a blast furnace at an Indiana plant.\nU.S. Steel\u2019s plans for the Pittsburg, California, plant are not immediately clear.\nThe East Bay in particular has become the manufacturing and industrial hub of the Bay Area, attracting investors from near and far.\nIn July BKM Capital Partners and Kayne Anderson Real Estate, through their industrial-focused joint venture,\npurchased a 16-building industrial portfolio\nin Concord and Hayward from a Blackstone affiliate for more than $120 million. In November, BKM and Kayne Anderson also bought a four-building, 105,101-square-foot industrial campus in Pleasant Hill for $25 million. Companies like Zoox, Amazon\u2019s robotaxi company, are\npicking up manufacturing operations\nin cities like Hayward.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Sometimes, winning a housing lottery isn\u2019t what it\u2019s cracked up to be.\nA Newsday newsletter on Tuesday caught my attention with this headline: \u201cA lottery could help some Long Islanders buy a condo for less than $300G.\u201d\nThe story said 16 two-story townhomes in the Beechwood Organization\u2019s 152-home Yaphank development can be purchased at a discount by buyers who meet income guidelines and are selected in the random drawing.\nI immediately thought back to a November story in Newsday about a condo lottery in Westhampton Beach. Winners would pay $535,875 for seven of the 45 homes in an Inland Real Estate Capital development where the listed prices were $1.4 million to $1.8 million.\nQuite a deal, right?\nHowever, of 136 lottery applicants,\nonly two were eligible\n. The earnings limit was 130 percent of the area median income, but some applicants didn\u2019t account for common charges, insurance premiums and other ownership expenses (the kind that tenants typically take for granted).\nYaphank isn\u2019t glamorous like Westhampton Beach, and the discounts for Beechwood\u2019s workforce homes don\u2019t sound as sexy either.\nSeven homes will be sold for $75,000 less than their $371,875 sticker price, a 20 percent discount. Another seven are just $25,000 off their regular price of $445,250, a savings of just 5.6 percent. The two income tiers are 80 percent and 120 percent of the area median income. (Two of the 16 workforce units will be built later and haven\u2019t been priced yet.)\nNewsday graciously put a puffy, e-mailed quote from Beechwood principal Steven Dubb high up in the article. \u201cOffering below market-rate homes through the lottery system helps us to help first-time new home owners, many who are essential workers, to establish themselves and stay on Long Island for years to come.\u201d\nAbsolutely true. But, reality check: This was a business strategy, not an act of pure altruism.\nAs the story later noted, Beechwood discounted 10 percent of the development\u2019s homes in return for being allowed to build at a higher density than the site\u2019s zoning.\nThis was possible under the Long Island Workforce Housing Act, passed in 2008. It applies to Nassau and Suffolk counties and defines \u201cworkforce\u201d housing as affordable to households earning up to 130 percent of the area median income. Developers can build the workforce units off-site, or not build them at all and pay into a workforce housing fund instead.\nA 2014\naudit\nof 29 developments built under the act flagged several for failing to meet its terms. The developer of a 32-unit project in the Town of Islip forgot to set aside any workforce units \u2014 and town officials forgot to check. The villages of Hempstead and Mineola approved three projects without the required workforce units.\nOne takeaway is that achieving affordability by regulation is possible but far from perfect. The Westhampton Beach lottery where only two applicants were eligible to buy\n$1.8 million homes\ndiscounted 70 percent might be an extreme example, but it shows the difficulty of this process.\nIn other cases, trust fund kids \u2014 just out of college but not earning much money yet \u2014 qualify to buy into affordable co-ops intended for working-class New Yorkers. Bloomberg blew the rich kids\u2019 cover with an\ninvestigative story\nin 2021, but gaming the system is still possible.\nAt one income-restricted co-op in East Harlem, where units are supposed to be owner-occupied, one woman\nacquired seven apartments\nand didn\u2019t live in any of them.\nNew York City in 2017\nmandated affordability\nin rezoned areas, but the law works much better in some neighborhoods (such as\nGowanus\n) than others (\nEast New York\n). A citywide law cannot account for the city\u2019s vastly different individual markets.\nThe quest to regulate affordability in high-demand metro areas such as New York and Los Angeles is enormously complex, inherently flawed and will never end. Meanwhile,\nsome cities\nhave achieved affordability without ever requiring it.\n",

The buyer is New York-based Nuveen Global Investments, deed records show.\nAfter buying the property in 2007, San Antonio Alternative Housing Corporation partnered with the Austin Housing Finance Corporation \u2014 crucially, the property it purchased is in Austin, the same municipality as the corporation \u2014 to issue $10.8 million in bonds to rehab the property.\nThe former owner got tax breaks in exchange for keeping rents affordable. Those credits were transferred to Nuveen.\nThe 252-unit apartment complex was built in 1972. Terms of the deal weren\u2019t disclosed, but the property was last valued at $26.4 million by the local appraisal district, which works out to $104,642 per unit.\nTax benefits conferred by Texas housing finance corporations came under fire after reporting showed that apartment owners were partnering with affordable housing entities in far-flung counties to wipe their properties off of local tax rolls.\nLawmakers\nresponded\nwith a crackdown on these so-called \u201ctraveling\u201d tax credits via House Bill 21, which passed in the summer of 2025. Affordable housing developers and advocates say\nit goes too far\nin its creation of new affordability requirements.\nInvestors\u2019 discontent inspired a\nlawsuit\nagainst the new legislation, which has further divided Texas\u2019 affordable housing development community. Some critics of the law\naren\u2019t on board with the lawsuit\n, since it was filed by an investor that used the maligned loophole. The suit, filed in September in Cameron County, remains pending.\nThe fallout of HB 21\u2019s passage is still ongoing. Some appraisal districts have taken the law as justification for denying property tax breaks for entities that used the loophole \u2014 even though the law appears to give them several years to come into compliance with new requirements.\n",

        "content": "A proposal for Surfside\u2019s first Live Local Act project with an 11-story building in an area capped at four floors has riled the coastal municipality.\nTwo developers want to build Ocean Walk Residences &amp; Hotel with 33 residential and hotel units on the 0.3-acre site at 250 95th Street, according to an application filed in November. The applicants are an affiliate of the site owner, New York-based Postal Realty Trust led by Andrew Spodek, and an entity called Ocean Walk Surfside LLC, registered to an attorney in downtown Miami.\nThe site, now home to an 8,000-square-foot post office, is on the west side of Collins Avenue.\nDesigned by Plus architecture firm, the building would consist of 13 four-bedroom units, seven efficiencies, two one-bedroom units and 11 hotel rooms. It will have a rooftop deck.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a disaster,\u201d Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said of the Live Local Act. \u201cI think the Florida politicians that decided to destroy the fabric and composition of small towns by this developer-driven initiative is outrageous.\u201d\nUnder the Live Local Act, developers can build bigger projects than a site\u2019s zoning permits if they designate 40 percent of units for households earning no more than 120 percent of the area median income. The below-market units have to be for rent and remain income-restricted for at least 30 years. Developers also can bypass public hearings to obtain approvals administratively.\nThe proposal doesn\u2019t specify how many units would be affordable.\nAcross South Florida, developers have seized on the law with a flurry of projects, but proposals for some small coastal Miami-Dade towns have touched off a firestorm.\nIn barrier islands such as Surfside, Bay Harbor Islands and Bal Harbour, \u201cthe Live Local Act does not give enough weight to the traffic impacts,\u201d said Surfside resident Michael Karukin. \u201cIt also does not give enough weight to what many comprehensive plans refer to as capacity in infrastructure.\u201d\nAside from concerns over additional strain on already congested roads, Ocean Walk opponents cited potential issues with crowded schools, and an erosion of the town\u2019s right to determine its own growth and development fate and preserve its small-town feel.\n\u201cIt takes me about 15 minutes to go 1 mile,\u201d said Surfside resident Robert Lisman. \u201cSurfside was designed to be a small family town, not like Sunny Isles Beach or Miami Beach.\u201d\nAlso a thorn for opponents: The developers propose underground parking, which the town banned in 2024, except for sites on the east side of Collins Avenue, according to the developers\u2019 letter of intent. But in the letter, they invoke\nSenate Bill 180\n, state law passed last year that prohibited local governments from enacting \u201cmore burdensome\u201d development regulations. The law was passed in the aftermath of several hurricanes as a way to remove roadblocks to reconstruction efforts.\nSurfside\u2019s underground parking prohibition \u201cdirectly impedes the redevelopment of the property,\u201d the developers\u2019 attorney, Graham Penn, wrote in the letter. The ordinance \u201cis therefore unenforceable and the applicant will be employing underground parking in the development.\u201d\nOpponents argue that Live Local only applies for sites zoned as commercial, industrial and mixed-use. The Ocean Walk development site\u2019s zoning doesn\u2019t fit under the state law, said Karukin, a former Surfside commissioner. Because of this, the proposal \u201cshould be rejected outright,\u201d he added.\nPenn, Postal Realty and Oren Lieber, the attorney listed as manager of Ocean Walk Surfside, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. It\u2019s unknown whether Postal Realty will partner on the project or sell the site to Ocean Walk Surfside.\nFabi\u00e1n Basabe, a state representative whose district includes much of coastal Miami-Dade, argued that Live Local isn\u2019t a \u201crubber stamp\u201d for projects. The law and Senate Bill 180 are meant to address the need for affordable housing, \u201cwhile intentionally preserving local authority\u201d and giving cities \u201cmeaningful tools\u201d to review and implement projects.\nTown staff members are working on the initial review of the application and will then proceed to more technical reviews, Mario Diaz, acting town manager said in a statement.\nAs for the developers\u2019 invocation of Senate Bill 180 regarding the underground parking ban, \u201cthe town views these positions as legal arguments\u201d and not \u201csettled conclusions,\u201d Diaz said.\nIn Bal Harbour, Surfside\u2019s neighbor to the north, Whitman Family Development\u2019s proposal for a Live Local Act project at its luxury Bal Harbour Shops led to an uproar. The project would add\n275-foot buildings\nwith 600 units, a 70-key hotel and 46,000 square feet of retail. Bal Harbour and Whitman have been locked in\nlitigation\nover the project.\nWhile opponents to Live Local projects tend to agree with its concept to incentivize development of below-market rentals, they take issue with its broad inclusion of all localities across the state, regardless of their own quirks.\n\u201cIt would be like putting up a 50-story affordable housing building on Fisher Island,\u201d Burkett said, referring to the exclusive residential island. \u201cWould that be a good idea, too?\u201d\n",

        "content": "A leading Keller Williams Realty team based in Austin is forming its own brokerage, aiming to claim ground ceded by a merging industry.\nBroker Kasey Jorgenson left Keller Williams to found Jorgenson Real Estate, ending a 16-year career at Austin-based Keller Williams, the largest franchise in the industry by agent count, according to a press release.\nThe Austin Business Journal ranked the Jorgenson Group second in the city from 2019 to 2023. The group totaled $75 million in sales over about 190 transactions in 2025, according to the release.\nAs the brokerage industry\ncoagulates\n, Jorgenson expects industry titans to gradually leave physical offices, presenting an opportunity for independent teams.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how these huge companies that have brick-and-mortar and local support staff \u2014 I don\u2019t see how they can afford to give the agents the value that they should be getting now. Not many Keller Williams market centers are hugely profitable,\u201d Jorgenson said.\nJorgenson Real Estate emerges amid a difficult market for the Austin area. Austin has lost more home value than any other major metropolitan area since its last market peak in 2022, with the median home price dropping to about $490,000 in 2025 from over $575,000 in 2022, according to Zillow. The decline reflects the wane of Austin\u2019s dalliance with the tech industry.\nWhile the Austin market may appear nominally\nbalanced\n, it has a vast, unrepresented share of homeowners who want to sell, but have failed, Jorgenson said.\n\u201cAt multiple points last year, about half of the properties that were active on the market were vacant. And that wasn\u2019t counting new construction,\u201d Jorgenson said. \u201cWe consider them as people that, quote-unquote, have to sell.\u201d\nAdditionally, while Austin\u2019s home inventory only occasionally\nlapped above six months supply last year\n\u2014 the traditional threshold of a buyer\u2019s market \u2014 it had been operating below four months supply\nsince the end of the Great Recession\n.\nA significant number of sellers have decided to rent out their homes instead\n, resulting in a \u201chuge behind-the-scenes\u201d inventory of homes that will return to the market in 2026, Jorgenson believes.\n\u201cWe opened up a property management side because we were tired of sending those people elsewhere. [Renters] saturated the\ncondo market, especially\n,\u201d Jorgensen said.\n",

The judge\u2019s decision represents not only a likely change in ownership in New York\u2019s multifamily market but a reminder of the limits to city power when it comes to the dealings of private companies.\nThe Mamdani administration earlier this week had asked for a 30-day pause on the sale to evaluate the transfer to Summit and explore potential alternatives. That followed similar requests from a coalition that included tenants, elected officials and the housing department under Mayor Eric Adams to delay the sale, originally with the hope that a nonprofit or other entity might be able to draw up a workable bid. Mayor Zohran Mamdani had taken things further, publicly championing the cause and vowing to intervene for tenants.\nSummit has a national portfolio of regional malls, office buildings and New York City apartments. Last summer, the company partnered with Savanna to acquire the leasehold at 444 Madison Avenue for $50 million. It offered $451 million for the Pinnacle portfolio as the minimum, or stalking horse, bidder in the auction.\nBut the Mamdani administration\nexpressed concern\nthat Summit wouldn\u2019t be able to make the acquisition work while repairing the properties with the proposed $451 million sale price. The legal rents on the units are low enough that the company likely couldn\u2019t maintain an income stream to profitably support renovations and debt service, the city said in a court filing.\nPinnacle\u2019s collection of bankrupt LLCs owes the city more than $12.7 million in unpaid fees and violations, according to court documents. They owe Flagstar Bank more than $564 million, according to court documents.\nThe sale is scheduled for Thursday. The mayor\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nKathryn Brenzel contributed reporting to this story.\n",

        "content": "The Kingston Common Council overrode the\nmayoral veto\nof a rent control resolution, in a largely expected move.\nA two-thirds majority would\u2019ve been sufficient to override the veto; the vote was unanimous, the Times Union\nreported\n.\n\u201cUpholding rent stabilization is not just a sound policy choice; it is our responsibility as local lawmakers to ensure that families can remain in their homes,\u201d majority leader Michelle Hirsch said after the vote on Tuesday, which drew a standing ovation from onlookers.\nMayor Steve Noble was present for the council meeting, though he did not appear during a public comment period.\nThe city\u2019s rent stabilization controversy was driven by a vacancy study that found rates in buildings covered by the Emergency Tenant Protection Act at 7.04 percent\nthis spring\n, above a 5 percent limit required to declare a \u201chousing emergency\u201d and keep rent caps in place. But the Council argued for a 4.55 percent citywide vacancy rate.\nNoble said the Common Council\u2019s resolution, which cites the 4.55 percent vacancy rate determined by an independent consultant hired by the city\u2019s Office of Housing Initiatives, \u201cmisconstrues aspects of the 2025 vacancy study and contains several factual errors.\u201d Notably, the city\u2019s report did not calculate a city-wide vacancy rate and the consultant only analyzed nine properties for its study.\nThe rent stabilization road in Kingston, which became the first upstate municipality to adopt the tenant protection measure in New York, has been controversial.\nLast August, the state\u2019s Court of Appeals\nrejected\na challenge from the Hudson Valley Property Owners Association, which argued the city\u2019s 2022 vacancy study was flawed and that its Rent Guidelines Board overreached by ordering a 15 percent rent rollback in stabilized buildings, allowing the reduction to stand and opening the door for tenants to seek refunds.\nKingston\u2019s ETPA initially covered 64 buildings and 1,200 apartments, though exemptions and rehab projects cut that total to fewer than 1,000 units, under 20 percent of the city\u2019s rentals.\nCouncil members can adjust which buildings qualify \u2014 for instance, covering only those with 22-plus units, a measure Noble supports \u2014 but can\u2019t expand eligibility beyond ETPA\u2019s pre-1974, six-unit minimum.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The 397,000-square-foot office tower is slated to be completed in 2028 and will rise next to a 304-unit multifamily building at 111 East Carson Boulevard.\nRiverside paired the debt with $105 million of structured equity from a joint venture involving RXR, One Investment Management and Liberty Mutual Investments, bringing the total capital committed for the phase to $350 million.\nThe financing comes with meaningful\npreleasing\nin hand. In September, Riverside announced that Charlotte-based law firm Moore &amp; Van Allen signed a 15-year lease for 206,000 square feet, more than half of the future office building, the Charlotte Business Journal\nreported\n. Insurance giant Pacific Life has also committed to 68,000 square feet, giving the project early momentum at a time when new office starts remain scarce nationwide.\nThe office tower is part of a larger, multi-tower redevelopment that Riverside has been assembling for years. The firm closed on the 1111 South Tryon site in 2021, which spans multiple parcels and currently houses fixtures like Midnight Diner and Uptown Cabaret. At the time, Riverside said construction on a mixed-use project featuring office, residential, retail and potentially a hotel would begin within a year.\nAltogether, the three-tower Queensbridge Collective is expected to carry total construction costs of up to $750 million, making it one of the more ambitious mixed-use projects in Charlotte\u2019s\nSouth End\ncorridor. South End, anchored by the LYNX Blue Line light rail and a steady influx of apartments and retail, has emerged as an\nactive submarket\nin the city for mixed-use development.\nNearby, Charlotte-based Panorama is adding to the momentum. The firm broke ground last year on The J, an 84-unit residential project at 1718\nSouth Tryon Street\n, with vertical construction now underway.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Changes are afoot in coastal Orange County, with The Agency making big moves for its Corona del Mar office to kick off the year.\nThe\nMauricio Umansky\n-led brokerage said it brought on luxury O.C. veteran\nJohn Stanaland\nand his six-person team from Douglas Elliman to The Agency\u2019s Corona del Mar office. Meanwhile, Craig Knizek will expand his duties to now include managing director of Corona del Mar, adding to his responsibilities as managing partner for The Agency\u2019s Sherman Oaks, Studio City and Calabasas offices. The three San Fernando Valley offices alone generate $1.6 billion in sales annually, according to the brokerage.\nWith the latest additions, the office\u2019s headcount rises to 55 agents.\n\u201cOrange County continues to be a cornerstone market for The Agency, and we\u2019re seeing that momentum reflected in both the level of business coming through the office and the talent choosing to join us,\u201d Umansky said in a statement to\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe moves are aimed at positioning the brokerage for \u201clong-term impact in the region,\u201d Umansky added.\nStanaland\nis a big get for the brokerage, with his team bringing more than 50 listings and decades of heritage doing business in coastal Orange County real estate.\nThe broker\u2019s family ties in Laguna Beach real estate trace back to 1919 with his great-great-grandfather. Since that time, the family has touched everything from real estate sales and development to the legal and financial sides.\nStanaland said in a statement that The Agency embodies the principles of \u201chonesty, integrity and never-yielding tenacity,\u201d pushing him toward the change of scenery.\nThe broker associate, who counts more than $4.8 billion in career sales, was most recently with Elliman, where his group had been since 2023 when they made the move from Villa Real Estate.\nAt the top of Stanaland\u2019s active listings is 32181 Coast Highway in Laguna Beach, which is asking $50 million, or $8,598 per square foot. The oceanfront estate is the priciest home on the market in Laguna Beach currently. There\u2019s also 31091 Coast Highway in Laguna Beach, which is priced at $19.9 million, or $4,625 per square foot.\nStanaland\u2019s group includes business partner Logan Montgomery, Zachary Balaban, Traci Landis and Luke Rogers, in addition to his son and \u201cSelling the OC\u201d cast member\nTyler Stanaland\n.\nKnizek, who has been with the brokerage since its 2011 founding, is the former producer of \u201cMad About You\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d original associate producer, with two decades of experience in\nfilm and television\nbefore jumping into real estate. He replaced Mike Schwartz, who was leading the Corona del Mar office in an interim capacity, while also serving as regional senior vice president as The Agency searched for a permanent managing director.\n",

        "content": "A long-vacant office building near the former Allstate headquarters campus could soon give way to wedding receptions and corporate galas.\nKehoe Designs President Tom Kehoe is planning to demolish a 106,167-square-foot office building at 2100 Sanders Road in Glenview and replace it with a two-story, 45,000-square-foot event venue, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The project would mark a second outpost of the Geraghty, the Pilsen-based venue Kehoe has owned and operated since 2015.\nThe proposal points to a creative redevelopment option for suburban office corridors littered with obsolete buildings that have struggled to attract tenants in the wake of remote work. Glenview has already leaned into that reality, most notably at the former\nAllstate campus\n, which has been remade into a\nsprawling industrial park\nafter the insurance giant decamped.\nKehoe told the outlet that he\u2019s spent years scouting the North Shore for a site to serve clients who have been pushing him to open closer to home. The 5-acre Sanders Road parcel, which borders the Cook County Forest Preserve, checked the right boxes, including ample green space for a venue with both indoor and outdoor components.\nThe existing office building, constructed in 1987 and formerly occupied by IMC Global, is owned by a venture tied to local investor Richard Colburn. Kehoe declined to disclose the purchase price, and the seller declined to comment.\nPending village approvals, Kehoe aims to close on the property and begin demolition this spring, with an eye toward opening the new venue \u2014 dubbed the Geraghty North \u2014 in spring 2027. Plans call for a maximum capacity of 600 guests and a design geared toward social and corporate events, according to a letter sent to neighbors, according to the publication. Kehoe is scheduled to present the project to nearby residents at a meeting hosted by the Glenview Park District, with a formal appearance before the village\u2019s development commission expected later this month.\nThe site sits across from\nCaremark Towers\n, another aging office complex whose owner is pursuing an industrial redevelopment.\nThe hospitality angle is also notable, as full-service hotels nearby once relied heavily on corporate events tied to Allstate\u2019s campus, but that demand cratered after the pandemic. The Hilton Chicago Northbrook, just over a mile away, defaulted on its mortgage after Allstate announced its exit, while the\nCrowne Plaza\nacross the street was hit with a foreclosure lawsuit last year.\nKehoe told the outlet that he sees an opening precisely because nearby options are limited, pointing to strong demand for outdoor-friendly venues.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Steve Croman is facing yet another foreclosure \u2014 and from a familiar foe.\nDalan Real Estate filed separate lawsuits against the\ninfamous\nlandlord over alleged loan defaults tied to seven rental properties in Manhattan, according to court documents. Croman is accused of defaulting on loans totaling roughly $39 million.\nCroman allegedly stopped making payments on the loans a year ago, according to the court filings. One loan is a $4.6 million mortgage tied to 44 Avenue B \u2014 where Croman allegedly owes $4.2 million \u2014 while the other is a $34.2 million mortgage collateralized by a handful of properties: 1345 Amsterdam Avenue, 277 East 10th Street, 279 East 10th Street, 321 West 16th Street, 521 East 5th Street and 52 Barrow Street. Croman allegedly owes $25.1 million on that debt.\nDalan is seeking to foreclose on the properties and have them auctioned. Dalan and Croman did not immediately respond to requests for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe two parties know each other well.\nLast month, Croman began\nbattling\na UCC sale on his $53 million Upper East Side home, initiated by Dalan. Croman argues the auction is not commercially reasonable, though he allegedly defaulted on a $31 million loan.\nEarlier last year, Dalan\nmoved to foreclose\non four of Croman\u2019s properties that have debt totaling $27.5 million; Dalan purchased a\n$140 million portfolio\nof the landlord\u2019s loans from Axos Bank in October 2024.\nIt\u2019s another headache for Croman, whose lenders are together trying to foreclose on more than $231 million in loan principal. Croman is also in the midst of a\nfight with his father,\nEdward Croman, who is trying to dissolve the family partnerships, alleging mismanagement.\nCroman the younger is one of the only New York landlords to have been sent to prison for real estate-related crimes. Once named one of the city\u2019s worst landlords, Croman served eight months in state prison related to mortgage and tax fraud and paid $8 million in restitution related to accusations of tenant harassment.\n",

It was the priciest per-key deal of 2025 at about $1.9 million a room, and one of California\u2019s priciest per-key deals ever.\nCapital Insight owns other hotels and motels throughout Southern California, in Anaheim, Thousand Oaks and Los Angeles, according to its website. That includes the shuttered Four Points by Sheraton, near Los Angeles International Airport, which Capital Insight intends to convert to\naffordable housing\n.\nCapital Insight\u2019s proposal for the former hotel \u2014 three interconnected, mid-century buildings with more than 560 rooms \u2014 is to turn it into 572 one-bedroom apartments.

Gavin Newsom\nis allocating more than $100 million in state funds to build affordable homes for victims of the Palisades and Eaton fires.\nOn Tuesday, the day before Los Angeles marked the one-year anniversary of the deadly wildfires, Newsom announced that $107.3 million in state money will be set aside to create 665 affordable rental units that will be offered first to those affected or displaced by the fires, according to Westside Current\nreporting\nand\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s calculations.\nThe money comes from a\nMultifamily Finance Super NOFA\n, or notice of funding of application, issued by the California Department of Housing and Community Development last February. A separate statewide Multifamily Finance Super NOFA announced in September provided nearly $56.9 million for four other developments with 301 affordable rental residences in fire-impacted areas across Los Angeles County. The September NOFA allowed developers in local jurisdictions to request funding from multiple state housing programs through a single application, in turn expediting the development of new homes.\nThe funding from the February NOFA will support the construction of nine multifamily projects across Los Angeles County. On the Westside, they include the 80-unit Tierra Apartments in Santa Monica, the 40-unit U.S. Vets-WLAVA building at the\nWest Los Angeles VA campus\nand the 176-unit Crenshaw Crossing development next to the Expo/Crenshaw Metro station. On the east side, the funding will support the 43-unit La Guadalupe project in Boyle Heights as well as the 100-unit Ramona housing project for seniors in Pasadena and 44-unit Colorado Crest Apartments, also in\nPasadena\n.\nElsewhere in L.A. County, a 50-unit complex at 15804 Lakewood Boulevard in Bellflower, a 59-unit senior apartment complex at 233 North Second Avenue in Covina and the 73-unit Mercy Claremont project in Claremont will also get construction financial aid from the NOFA.\nThe developments benefiting from the new NOFA aren\u2019t in burn scar areas and will not replace destroyed homes.

The new Agency office opened Tuesday at 14140 Southwest Freeway, marking the brokerage\u2019s first office in the Houston market.\nUmansky\n, best known for starring in Netflix\u2019s \u201cBuying Beverly Hills\u201d and his ties to Bravo\u2019s \u201cReal Housewives of Beverly Hills\u201d universe, founded The Agency in 2011. Since then, he\u2019s built the firm into a global luxury brand with more than 150 offices across 14 countries. Expansion has been brisk: The Agency\nlaunched\n27 offices in 2025 alone, according to the outlet, with more in the pipeline.\nHouston has long been on the company\u2019s shortlist. The Agency already operates in other major Texas metros, including Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, and Umansky has pitched the state as a market with durable fundamentals and room for long-term growth, he told the publication.\nThe Sansone Group is led by Chris and Lizz Sansone, who founded the team in 2000 and have spent 24 years under the Re/Max umbrella. Their nine-agent operation ranked No. 10 among small residential teams in the publication\u2019s 2025 Residential Real Estate Awards, logging $78.2 million in sales across the Greater Houston area.\nThe pairing began with a chance meeting at a Houston Association of Realtors event and evolved into a franchise deal that gives the Sansones ownership of the first Agency outpost in Houston. Lizz Sansone described the move as a \u201clegacy\u201d play after decades with the same brokerage, citing alignment around culture, service and branding.\nThe Agency\u2019s arrival adds to a growing cast of personality-driven brokerages in Houston. White House Global Properties Chairman Washington Ho, star of HBO Max\u2019s \u201cHouse of Ho,\u201d already\nclaims a slice\nof the city\u2019s reality TV\u2013meets\u2013real estate overlap.\nWhile Umansky\u2019s\npersonal r\u00e9sum\u00e9\nleans heavily toward trophy deals, The Agency has been clear that it\u2019s not chasing only ultra-luxury listings.

Not so fast, apparently.\nThe deal for MCR Hotels and its leader Tyler Morse to take control of the swanky club is in danger, Hotel Dive\nreported\n. Days ago, MCR informed investment firm Yucaipa Companies \u2014 which has a controlling interest in the business \u2014 that it would not be able to fund its closing commitment, according to an SEC\nfiling\n.\nAs part of its\n$2.7 billion privatization deal\n, MCR \u2014 which owns high-end hospitality destinations like the High Line Hotel and Gramercy Park Hotel \u2014 pledged to buy $200 million worth of public Soho House shares at $9 per share by the close of the merger. That price point represented an 18 percent premium on what the stock traded at before the deal was announced, but well below the $14 initial public offering in 2021.\nBillionaire Ron Burkle and his Yucaipa entity were set to roll over their existing stake and retain majority control of the new company, according to a press release when the deal was announced.\nMorse was set to snag a seat on the board as vice chairman. Actor-turned-investor Ashton Kutcher was part of a group chipping in new equity capital and joined the board, while Apollo Global Management was said to be refinancing roughly $700 million in debt.\nNow, everything is up in the air. MCR and Soho House could not be reached for comment by the publication.\nBurkle and his firm aren\u2019t throwing in the towel, yet.\n\u201cYucaipa and the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, together with their respective advisors, are engaging with affiliates of MCR, as well as other parties, to secure the funding,\u201d according to the funding, adding that success was not guaranteed.\nSoho House counts 46 locations and more than 200,000 members on its books. The company is credited with leading the wave of members-only clubs that have become a staple of the New York City social scene, snapping up buildings and long-term leases in recent years.\nThe company, founded in 1995, paved the way for clubs like Casa Cipriani, Zero Bond and Aman New York.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The storied St. Regis Houston has a new owner \u2014 and a new identity \u2014 as local businessman Leslie Doggett moves deeper into hospitality with plans for a ground-up refresh of the luxury hotel between River Oaks and the Galleria.\nDoggett, whose family empire\nLeslie Doggett Industries\nspans industrial equipment and car dealerships, acquired the hotel at 1919 Briar Oaks Lane and is planning a multimillion-dollar renovation over the next two years, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n. The seller was not disclosed, and Doggett declined to share the purchase price.\nThe acquisition marks a personal and strategic pivot for Doggett, who said the hotel\u2019s revival is as much emotional as it is financial. He and his wife spent their wedding night there in 1984, when the property was known as The Remington. \u201cThe hotel has excellent bones,\u201d Doggett told the outlet, \u201cbut it just needs a few upgrades.\u201d\nAs part of the deal, the hotel will exit the St. Regis flag \u2014 operated by Marriott International \u2014 and rebrand under Marriott\u2019s Luxury Collection as The Houston Grand Hotel \u2014 River Oaks. Doggett told the outlet that the property is not affiliated with the nearby\nSt. Regis Residences\nHouston condo project.\nOpened in 1982, the hotel later became Houston\u2019s first\nRitz-Carlton\nand famously hosted Queen Elizabeth II in 1991 before losing the Ritz flag in 1997. Doggett\u2019s vision is to restore what he calls the city\u2019s \u201cgrandest hotel experience,\u201d with a family-owned approach.\nRenovations are expected to be designed this year and completed by the end of 2027, overseen by Saddlebrook Equity and Management, an arm of Doggett\u2019s broader business. Connecticut-based HEI Hotels &amp; Resorts has taken over management.\nPlans start with a dramatic lobby overhaul: tearing down walls, restoring 12-foot ceiling heights by removing the current drop ceilings and opening up back-of-house space to create a more theatrical arrival. The reimagined ground floor is slated to include a coffee shop, a barber shop, a restaurant replacing The Remington, a gun shop, a spirits-heavy lounge and other experiential touches Doggett believes guests are craving.\nDoggett told the outlet that the location is nonnegotiable. \u201cThis area is ground zero for Houston hotels,\u201d he said.\nGuest rooms across all 12 floors will be renovated in phases to avoid a full closure, while the property\u2019s event spaces, fitness center and pool deck are also in line for major upgrades. New York-based designer Charlotte Moss is leading interiors.\nDoggett is also partnering on a planned mixed-use development nearby that could bring a 50-story condo-hotel tower and office space to\nPost Oak Boulevard\n.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Three of New York\u2019s biggest real estate players are locked in a legal fight over a UCC sale tied to\nWorldwide Plaza\n.\nOwners SL Green and RXR are asking a New York judge to stop what they call a \u201csham auction\u201d by an entity tied to Gary Barnett\u2019s Extell Development that aims to wrest control of the debt on the 1.8-million-square-foot office tower at 825 Eighth Avenue.\nIn a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Manhattan Supreme Court, the landlords accused Barnett of engineering a rigged UCC foreclosure to seize control of the ongoing restructuring of the $940 million CMBS senior mortgage on the 49-story tower. They are asking a judge to stop the\nJanuary 15 sale\n.\nBarnett claims to own a $190 million mezzanine loan tied to the property and has scheduled a public auction of the controlling entity. But the landlords say Extell has never shown any proof that it actually owns the loan, despite repeated requests. The owners received a default notice in October from Barnett, according to the suit.\nAccording to the complaint, the foreclosure effort is not a genuine attempt to recover on the mezzanine debt but a control play orchestrated by Barnett to give Extell leverage in the ongoing debt restructuring, claiming that Extell has a direct interest in the bonds backed by the tower.\nSL Green and RXR argue the UCC sale is a sham because it was structured to deter real bidders. In their filing, the landlords say the auction\u2019s rushed timeline, lack of proper documentation and restrictive terms all but guarantee Barnett will win control of the property.\nAn Extell spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\u201cWorldwide Plaza is an iconic, well-located asset, and we are ready to execute a robust redevelopment plan that will create an incredible offering in the heart of Midtown,\u201d an SL Green spokesperson said. \u201cThe complaint reveals the lender\u2019s underhanded attempt to interfere with the revitalization of the building and the tenants in our property.\u201d\nKorea-based Shinhan Financial Group provided $190 million of mezzanine debt on the building in 2017. The property is backed\nby $940 million in CMBS debt\noriginated by Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank.\nThe debt\nwent to special servicing\nin September 2024 after law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore vacated 617,000 square feet for Brookfield\u2019s Two Manhattan West, leaving Worldwide Plaza about 40 percent vacant. That space remains empty and the building was only 63 percent occupied as of March, according to Morningstar, down from 91 percent in 2023.\nThat could worsen as Nomura Holdings \u2014 the largest remaining tenant \u2014 plans to slash 75,000 square feet from its footprint by the beginning of 2027. The leftover 630,000 square feet is due to expire in 2033.\nThe property was appraised at $345 million in April, down\n80 percent\nfrom its 2017 $1.7 billion valuation, according to CMBS loan documents. That appraisal drop is expected to cause $500 million of losses to the property\u2019s CMBS bondholders.\nLast month, Morningstar downgraded the rating to junk on the CMBS trust holding $705M of the building\u2019s debt. The special servicer is reportedly negotiating with the borrower regarding a loan modification, according to Morningstar.\n",

        "content": "In the aftermath of the passage of the 2019 rent laws, some prominent real estate leaders still didn\u2019t know the name of a person key to orchestrating what one landlord referred to as a \u201chorror show.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t they know who I am? Ego and confidence,\u201d Cea Weaver\ntold The Real Deal\na few months after the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act became law.\nOf course, Weaver is no longer a stranger to the industry.\nThe renter activist was one of Mayor Zohran Mamdani\u2019s first appointments after he was sworn in as mayor, naming her as the director of the newly revived Office to Protect Tenants. In recent days, news articles have highlighted her past posts on social media, leading to a flurry of attacks from the right and testimonials of her advocacy work from the left.\nBut ever since 2019, more real estate insiders have become aware of Weaver and the bloc she represents. Weaver and her organization, Housing Justice for All, have been a driving force behind policy initiatives most feared by the real estate industry, including the\nHSTPA\n, demands for canceling rent during the pandemic, good cause eviction, expansion of rent regulation throughout the state and calls for freezing the rent.\nIn the lead-up to the HSTPA, Weaver\u2019s coalition appealed directly to lawmakers, who reached a two-way deal without then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Despite\npleas\nfrom real estate executives to veto the bill, Cuomo signed it into law.\nNot all of these efforts have been successful. Rent wasn\u2019t canceled, and though the state legislature passed good cause eviction in\n2024\n, Weaver and other advocates complained that the approved version was\nwatered down\n. The Rent Guidelines Board declined to freeze rents last year, but the new mayor has vowed to do so for the next four years.\nIn the spotlight\nWeaver served as a housing adviser to Mamdani during his mayoral campaign and as part of the newly launched New York State Tenant Bloc, mobilized tenants last year to only support mayoral candidates who supported a rent freeze.\nShe\u2019s also periodically drawn the industry\u2019s ire with\nsocial media posts\nabout rent regulation and other far-left priorities, though not to the extent seen this week.\nSocial media and news sites erupted this week over some of Weaver\u2019s old tweets. One of her posts, from 2017, referred to homeownership as \u201ca weapon of white supremacy masquerading as \u2018wealth building\u2019 public policy.\u201d\nWhen asked about the post, Mayor Zohran Mamdani defended his selection of Weaver for the Office to Protect Tenants, saying she was hired \u201cbased on the track record that she had of standing up for tenants across the city in the state.\u201d He\u2019s also said he\u2019s committed to providing stability for homeowners and would-be homeowners alongside tenants.\nDuring interviews with NY1\u2019s Errol Louis, Weaver said the phrasing of the old social media posts was \u201cinelegant\u201d and \u201cregretful.\u201d\n\u201cI certainly do not think that all homeownership is white supremacy,\u201d she\ntold Louis\non his podcast this week, adding that she was referring to longstanding\ninequities\nin homeownership.\nLast year, as part of a\nTRD\n\u2019s magazine feature,\nThe Debate\n, Weaver defended rent stabilization as a way to provide predictability to renters in the same way that fixed-rate mortgages help property owners.\n\u201cRenters should have access to the same stability, especially as homeownership \u2014 always a myth, but a potent one \u2014 becomes unattainable for millions,\u201d wrote at the time.\nLongtime contentious figure\nThis week was not the first time that Weaver has faced backlash at the prospect of holding a government position. In 2021, she was\nnominated\nto the City Planning Commission, but withdrew her name amid opposition.\nIn her new role with the Office to Protect Tenants, Weaver will ensure that \u201cpro-tenant policy is moved into every aspect of the administration\u2019s housing agenda,\u201d she told Louis.\nThe office, alongside other city agencies, will host \u201c\nRental Ripoff\n\u201d hearings focused on \u201cillegal, unfair, abusive, deceptive, or unconscionable landlord practices.\u201d\nMamdani has repeatedly committed to addressing owners\u2019 costs through property tax reform and other initiatives, such as alternative insurance models, though he hasn\u2019t released many details on how to pursue those actions. Rent stabilization reform would need to happen at the state level, and lawmakers have shown little interest in taking up the issue.\nWeaver\u2019s old tweets have become a proxy fight over fears of what lies in store in the Mamdani administration and to what extent socialist policies take hold. (The City Council\u2019s new Republican minority leader, David Carr, quoted Weaver\u2019s tweets during a meeting on Wednesday and talked about the threat of \u201csmothering collectivism\u201d to property rights and individual liberties.)\nWhile his initial actions as mayor targeted \u201cbad landlords,\u201d Mamdani also\nsigned executive orders\naimed at finding ways to speed up housing construction. Ahead of the election, some affordable housing developers said they were hopeful about the mayor\u2019s plans to build 200,000 housing units over the next decade.\nWeaver has also voiced support for ramping up housing construction in the city. She publicly supported housing\nballot measures\nbefore Mamdani confirmed that he was voting for them. She also warned against housing regulation bills that housing groups argued would thwart the new mayor\u2019s housing plan.\n",

The properties total 803 units, though the price JRK spent on each of the three properties is not clear.\nIn Los Angeles, JRK bought C on Pico, a 94-unit residential development at 12301 West Pico Boulevard in Sawtelle. Up north in\nSeattle\n, the company bought the 208-unit Centennial property at 2515 Fourth Avenue, and across the country, JRK picked up the 77 Park Avenue Apartments in Hoboken boasting 301 units.\nJRK, through its JRK Platform 5 fund, closed on approximately 3,400 units throughout last year. The fund focuses on core-plus and value-add apartments built after 1990. JRK also utilized its JRK MF Opportunities III fund, which targets properties built before 1990, to complete purchases last year.\nThe company believes the multifamily sector has \u201creached an inflection point\u201d where it can \u201cacquire assets at a unique time where new supply subsides and long-term fundamentals remain strong,\u201d Daniel Lippman, president of JRK president, said in a statement, per CO.

        "content": "Fred Seigel\u2019s commercial real estate firm Beacon Capital Partners is accused of abandoning its commitment to fund a series of biotech incubators, jeopardizing leases in Chicago\u2019s Fulton Market and elsewhere across the country.\nChicago-based incubator firm Portal Innovations filed a lawsuit against Boston-based Beacon, its joint venture partner, last month, alleging the firm failed to follow through on agreements to fund the startup\u2019s operations in four U.S. cities, including Chicago. Beacon owns significant Chicago office properties, including one in the midst of a\n$370 million foreclosure dispute\n, and recently\ntook a loss on a LaSalle Street office sale\nin the Loop.\nPortal\u2019s litigation underscores fears that life sciences investments became over-saturated during and just after the pandemic.\nPortal currently occupies a 53,000-square-foot workspace in Trammell Crow\u2019s lab office building at 400 North Aberdeen Street in Fulton Market. Portal is also a partner at the University of Chicago Polsky Center\u2019s life sciences incubator at\nHyde Park Labs\n, a 13-story commercial building at 5207 South Harper Avenue developed by Beacon and Trammell.\nBeacon, along with its key financial backer, California Teachers Retirement System, had an agreement to fund Portal\u2019s \u201claunchpads\u201d in Chicago, Atlanta, Houston and Boston so that Portal could use its \u201cexpertise\u201d at helping early stage startups with their real estate, equipment and capital requirements, the lawsuit says. The retirement fund owned 98 percent of the Beacon entities\u2019 stakes in the Portal projects at issue, according to the litigation.\nBut at some point in 2024, Beacon and the California teachers \u201clost interest\u201d in life sciences and began refusing to fund capital calls as agreed upon between the investors and Portal, the suit claims.\nSince the dispute began, Portal\u2019s locations across the U.S. have struggled to keep up with bills, including lease payments, the lawsuit alleges. In some locations, including Boston and Houston, Portal launchpads are at risk of shutting down imminently, the filing claims.\nMuch of Portal\u2019s lawsuit against Beacon is redacted, but it states Beacon refused to fund capital calls unless Portal \u201creworked its contractual obligations.\u201d The suit doesn\u2019t specify Beacon\u2019s demands within the un-redacted portions of the lawsuit, but Portal claims Beacon is trying to remove Portal as manager of their joint ventures. Beacon\u2019s refusal throughout 2025 to further fund Portal has caused their joint ventures to lose out on adding prospective members to their rosters at their various lab leases, Portal\u2019s suit claims.\n\u201cThe larger impact is the reputational damage in the life science market, as [Beacon\u2019s] actions have made it appear that [Portal] and the joint venture companies are untrustworthy partners that back out of deals at the last minute,\u201d Portal said in its suit.\nRepresentatives of Portal and Beacon didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nBeacon filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit late last month, revealing more details about the fight \u2014 and claiming Portal\u2019s financial performance has been \u201cdismal,\u201d with losses of over $50 million posted by their joint ventures.\nOver the past few years, life science offices have seen a decrease in interest from the commercial real estate sector amid fears they were overbuilt during the pandemic when traditional office demand imploded. As the general office market continues to recover, investors are less keen to replace their hopes with life sciences.\nIn 2024, Chicago-based\nFulton Street Companies pivoted from developing a life sciences project\nto building a two-tower complex with over 1,000 housing units at 1200 West Fulton Street. Furthermore, investors in developer Sterling Bay\u2019s 285,000-square-foot life sciences building next to the\nfailed Lincoln Yards megaproject parcels\nare poised to take a loss. The property remains vacant and is set to be sold in a bid to cover construction debt funded by Bank OZK. Plus, a separate\n$265 million Bank OZK loan note\nbacking another vacant life sciences property that Sterling built in San Diego was offloaded this week by the lender to another buyer.\nIn Cook County Court in Illinois, Beacon\u2019s motion to dismiss claims Portal\u2019s only capital calls at issue were two rounds totaling just $900,000. Beacon also alleges that it and its partners have invested over $52 million in the Portal joint ventures, plus over $42 million in tenant improvement costs to help build out their workspaces.\nBeacon argues it had no obligation to fund the recent capital calls because Portal failed to secure approval for a 2025 annual budget, a contractual prerequisite for demanding cash. Beacon further alleges the entities have lost about $50.5 million to date, while significantly missing revenue projections.\nThe filing accuses Portal of \u201cmisconduct,\u201d claiming the incubator firm improperly used joint venture funds to pay itself excessive management fees and cover costs for unrelated businesses. Beacon asserts it exercised its right to remove Portal as the manager of the joint ventures last month \u2014 a few days before Portal filed its lawsuit \u2014 due to these alleged breaches of fiduciary duty.\nBeacon further denies that the leases are in immediate jeopardy, stating the joint ventures currently hold about $2.5 million in cash on hand. Regarding the Fulton Market site specifically, Beacon argues it has already met its $15 million contribution cap and has no obligation to provide more funding.\nA hearing on each of the litigants\u2019 various motions is set for 10 a.m. Monday in courtroom 2408 at the Richard J. Daley Center in Chicago, online records show.\n",

Maxx signed a lease for 26,000 square feet of street-level space at 939 West North Avenue, according to a press release, giving the off-price retailer street-level space at the southeast corner of North Avenue and Sheffield Avenue. The store is slated to open this fall under a 10-year lease, the release shows.\nThe deal marks a milestone for Chicago-based Farpoint and MCZ, which bought the roughly 200,000-square-foot property at auction in\nFebruary 2024\nfor about $20 million from Iowa-based Principal Financial Group. The price equated to $100 per square foot \u2014 less than a quarter of what it fetched in 2004, when it sold for $89 million. At the\ntime of the purchase\n, its nearly 95,400 square feet of retail space was just 15 percent leased, while the roughly 104,000 square feet of upper-floor medical office and fitness component was 88 percent occupied, according to CBRE data previously reported by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe building, built in 2002, currently houses tenants including Fitness Formula Clubs, Iteld Plastic Surgery and Urban Oasis Massage. MCZ has been investing in upgrades, including a refreshed facade and modernized amenities, as part of a repositioning aimed at drawing higher traffic retail to complement the existing health and wellness uses, according to the release.\nMid-America Real Estate brokers Paul Bryant and Jaime Bertsche represented Farpoint in the lease, while Metro Commercial Real Estate\u2019s Gary Greenfield and Steven Baer represented T.J. Maxx.\nFarpoint principal Alex Katz said in the statement that landing the discount retailer confirmed the firm\u2019s confidence in the building\u2019s location.\nT.J. Maxx operates about two dozen locations across the Chicago area, including downtown and nearby Lakeview, according to the retailer\u2019s website.\nThe lease follows a recent pattern for Farpoint, which has been scooping up high-profile retail properties at distressed prices and backfilling them with brand-name tenants. The firm recently announced deals to bring a\nJPMorgan Chase flagship\nand luxury chocolatier Hotel Chocolat to the building at\n830 North Michigan Avenue\n, another once-troubled retail property it acquired at a steep discount.\n",

        "content": "It would be an understatement to say there\u2019s little optimism that Albany lawmakers will do something good for real estate this session.\nKilling the 485x wage rules would create thousands more apartments, but it\u2019s hard to imagine Gov. Kathy Hochul and others defying construction unions \u2014 who basically wrote the rules \u2014 in an election year.\nWith the governor and everyone else focused on affordability, I would also be shocked if lawmakers allow higher rent increases to renovate rent-stabilized apartments, even as\ntens of thousands sit vacant\n.\nWhat about a new tax break or direct funding for apartment improvements? Don\u2019t count on it. Expanding child care is a much higher priority for lawmakers, and it will be expensive. Other funding will go toward offsetting federal cuts. Little will be left for buildings.\nIn another bad break for rent-stabilized owners, Linda Rosenthal\nisn\u2019t running\nfor the state Senate seat being vacated by Brad Hoylman-Sigal. That means she will remain chair of the Assembly Housing Committee, where she is a huge impediment to any reform seen as helping landlords.\nSome legislators are interested in bringing down insurance premiums, not so much to help landlords but because politicians like to go after big corporations. Insurance companies, which have jacked up their rates, would seem like a fine target.\nBut going after them is like stabbing Jell-O with a fork. They are already regulated by the Department of Financial Services, and most probably donate to legislators who sit on the relevant committees.\nMore importantly, if carriers feel they\u2019re taking on too much risk or being treated unfairly by the government, they simply stop writing policies. When insurers withdraw from a particular area or stop covering a certain class of buildings, the remaining insurers can charge more.\nI\u2019m a homeowner who has never filed an insurance claim. Yet insurers have canceled or declined to renew my policy several times. In what other industry do businesses regularly abandon their customers?\n\u201cHello, this is Equinox. We thank you for being a loyal customer, but we\u2019re declining to renew your gym membership.\u201d\nNever gonna happen.\nThe political strategy, therefore, is not to punish insurers but to attract them, to increase competition and add options for building owners.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nOne landlord predicts state legislators will make things worse, not better, for owners this session. \u201cThey\u2019re going to pass\na ton of new rules\n,\u201d tweeted WestHarlm.\nA tenant who WestHarlm discovered illegally rents two rent-stabilized units threatened in front of eight witnesses to kill and then behead him.

It\u2019s hard not to think that California\u2019s housing shortage could be eliminated if treated with the same urgency.\nElsewhere\u2026\nDespite some\nnews coverage\n, few people noticed when, two days before Christmas, a garbage truck in East Harlem caused a scaffolding collapse that killed a woman.\nTo my knowledge, no one has estimated how many lives have been saved by Local Law 11, which triggered an epidemic of sidewalk sheds in an effort to prevent fatalities from falling debris.\nAny such analysis, which should certainly be done, must also take into account how many people lose their lives in scaffolding collapses. It\u2019s rare, but then, so were deaths from falling debris before Local Law 11. They remain rare in cities that don\u2019t have an equivalent law.\nThe Adams administration made progress in reducing the number of sheds, but no one will ever acknowledge that it might not make sense to try to prevent every death from a particular kind of accident. The\nconsequences\nof such an effort \u2014 including the use of resources that would otherwise go toward other needs \u2014 have to be measured as well.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$7.73 million\nfor a 2,524-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at The Cortland, 555 West 22nd Street in Chelsea. Shaun Osher of CORE had the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$71 million\nfor a 66,893-square-foot, mixed-use property at 410 West 13th Street in the Meatpacking District. TP Angelo Gordon purchased the property from British firm Epic.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$26.75 million\nfor a 7,000-square-foot condominium unit at 1110 Park Avenue in Carnegie Hill. Eva Penson of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty has the listing.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "\ud83c\udfc6 Residential:\nThe most expensive home sale recorded in South Florida was in Fort Lauderdale. A newly built condo at\nKolter Urban\u2019s\nSelene Oceanfront Residences at\n151 North Seabreeze Boulevard\nsold for $10.9 million. The buyer was\nDon Marco Holdings, LLC\n, a Texas company.\nDouglas Elliman\nis marketing the development, which consists of two, 26-story towers.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe priciest commercial deal recorded in South Florida was in Pompano Beach, where an apartment complex at\n275 North Federal Highway\ntraded for $41 million. The seller was an affiliate of Montreal-based\nFrankforter Group\n, and the buyer was an LLC tied to\nGriffis Residential\n, based in Greenwood Village, Colorado. The building has 144 units and measures more than 171,000 square feet. It previously sold for $42.9 million in 2021.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nIn Highland Beach, a single-family, oceanfront home at\n2545 South Ocean Boulevard\nchanged hands for $17.5 million or $3,300 per square foot. The seller was Boston-area real estate developer\nCarol Sawyer Parks\n, and the buyer was an LLC managed by\nThe Kolter Group\n, based in Delray Beach. The four-bedroom home measures 5,300 square feet and has a four-car garage, four and a half baths, a pool, an elevator and a wraparound balcony. Parks paid $2.5 million for the site in 2006, and the home was completed in 2009. It hit the market in December with an asking price of $25 million. Douglas Elliman\u2019s\nNick Malinosky\nrepresented both parties in the transaction.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nA trust tied to Boston-based attorney\nDaniel P. Tighe\nsold a home at\n253 Jamaica Lane\nin Palm Beach for $13.1 million. The buyer was an LLC managed by\nAmy and Scott Madden.\nThe transaction pencils out to just over $3,000 per square foot. The home, built in 2016, has four bedrooms and measures roughly 4,300 square feet. The trust purchased the residence in 2017 for $5.4 million; it went on sale in March for about $15.8 million.\nMargit Brandt\nwith Premier Estate Properties represented both sides of the deal.\nBy the Numbers:\nHome loan activity surges year over year despite holiday drop\nDespite taking a dip during the holiday season, residential mortgage activity is elevated into the new year.\nFor the week ending Jan. 2, the number of new purchase mortgage applications tumbled by almost 33 percent compared to four weeks prior, and refinancing applications also were lower, by 37 percent, according to the latest survey from the\nMortgage Bankers Association\n.\nHowever, both purchase and refinance loan application volume was much higher compared to the same time last year. Refinancing activity surged by nearly 108 percent year over year, while purchase applications were up by 10 percent.",

        "content": "Billionaire Jeffrey Soffer\u2019s plan to add cabanas and waterslides at his iconic Fontainebleau Miami Beach resort could be swept away next month.\nTwo city elected officials, including Mayor Steven Meiner, joined a grassroots coalition of residents, activists and preservationists in opposing\nSoffer\u2019s controversial proposal\nto add a towering water park-style amenity to the historic 1,593-room hotel\u2019s pool deck, ratcheting up pressure on the city\u2019s Historic Preservation Board days before a crucial vote on Feb. 10.\nThe 22-acre landmark is at\n4441 Collins Avenue\n.\nMeiner posted an image of the planned pool renovations on his Instagram account along with a long caption on why he\u2019s against it, following a Zoom meeting of the MidBeach Neighborhood Association this week.\n\u201cThe resident outcry against this project over traffic, noise, and neighborhood impacts has been understandably loud, and I share these concerns,\u201d Meiner wrote.\nIn a phone interview with\nThe Real Deal\n,\nMeiner\nsaid the Fontainebleau proposal triggered one of the largest waves of constituent outreach he\u2019s experienced, and that the feedback has been overwhelmingly negative.\n\u201cIt is hard to find a resident who is supportive of the project,\u201d Meiner said.\nMeiner and his city commission colleagues won\u2019t get to decide the fate of Soffer\u2019s plan, however. That duty falls on the historic preservation board, which in November delayed voting on the planned renovation to give Soffer\u2019s Aventura-based\nFontainebleau Development\ntime to tweak the height and size of a cabana structure and a concrete tower connected to a network of waterslides.\nMeiner said that his and residents\u2019 objections center on traffic, safety and environmental impacts, and that nothing he heard during the MidBeach Neighborhood Association meeting changed his mind.\nFontainebleau Development reduced the height of the cabana structure to two stories from three stories and slashed the waterslide tower from 12 stories to 10 stories, updated renderings and plans show.\nFontainebleau Development\ndefended its revisions in a statement, saying the revised project incorporates community input and feedback from the first Historic Preservation Board meeting.\u00a0 Fontainebleau Development senior vice president Anthony Stahl said in the Zoom meeting that the poolside upgrades will help boost nightly room rates and fund upkeep of the property\u2019s main historic building designed by the late Miami Beach architect, Morris Lapidus.\nStahl repeatedly downplayed opponents\u2019 assertions that Fontainebleau Development is creating a destination water park that will be open to the general public. He insisted that the slides and amenities are meant for hotel guests rather than day visitors. However, Stahl acknowledged that day passes to use the resort\u2019s amenities would include access to the waterslides.\nHe framed the overhaul as a pivot away from the \u201cspring breaker party scene\u201d toward a more family-friendly, high-end environment.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to have adults popping bottles, partying, loud music,\u201d Stahl said. \u201cThe intent is for all that to go away.\u201d\nNeighborhood leaders questioned Fontainebleau\u2019s assurances.\nMarc Weiss, an attorney who lives in the city, called the plan \u201cthe greatest threat facing Miami Beach today.\u201d\nWeiss claimed he was able to place an online day pass order for 90 adults and 90 children for the existing pool, arguing that the new amenity will inevitably function as an attraction open to the public.\n\u201cTheme parks bring a ratchet crowd,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cIt\u2019s tacky.\u201d\nCity Commissioner Tonya Bhatt derided the pool renovations.\n\u201cMorris Lapidus would be turning in his grave,\u201d Bhatt said. \u201cWe are united, we are angry, we are going to fight this\u2026This is unthinkable.\u201d",

The 1926-built beach club was restored.\nThe Ashleys\u2019 Edgewater condo has four bedrooms and five and a half bathrooms, spanning 3,300 square feet. The asking price works out to $1,700 per square foot. They purchased the unit in 2021 for $2.7 million, when the project was still under construction by Two Roads Development.\nThe building features interiors by French designer Jean-Louis Deniot, whose portfolio includes the Waldorf Astoria Residences in New York.

        "content": "Kane County is poised to step into the short-term rental debate, with county officials set to vote next week on a package of regulations aimed at Airbnb and Vrbo-style rentals in unincorporated areas.\nThe proposed rules are headed to the northeastern Illinois county\u2019s board for a final vote Tuesday after months of committee debate, resident testimony and revisions prompted by complaints about noise, parking and safety. The Chicago Tribune\nreported\nthat if approved, the ordinance would mark the county\u2019s first formal framework for regulating short-term rentals \u2014 a growing slice of the housing market that\u2019s increasingly colliding with suburban quality of life concerns.\nThe push gained momentum last fall, when residents from a quiet cul-de-sac urged the county to intervene. Susan Blassick told the county\u2019s Development Committee in October that a nearby short-term rental had brought loud parties, party buses and clogged street parking to her block.\n\u201cWe all bought homes here because of the serene environment,\u201d she said at the meeting, \u201cnever envisioning that a short-term rental would be on our street.\u201d\nIn response, Kane County staff drafted amendments to the county code that would require short-term rentals to obtain a license from the Development and Community Services Department and comply with a long list of operational standards. Similar debates are playing out\nacross the region\n. St. Charles opted for new\ntaxes and regulations\nlast year; Lake County banned short-term rentals in unincorporated areas, while Skokie and\nChicago\nhave explored tighter controls.\nUnder the Kane County proposal, operators would pay a $200 licensing fee, cap occupancy at two guests per bedroom with a maximum of 16 guests, and limit rentals to 12 contracts or 180 rental days per year, whichever is greater. Commercial vehicles would be barred, as would parking campers, food trucks or portable hot tubs.\nOwners\nwould also need to provide proof of insurance, pass safety inspections, test smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and designate a 24-hour local contact.\nThe ordinance would require owners to notify adjoining neighbors by mail before the first rental of each year and post the license visibly inside the property. Violations could result in license suspension or revocation, while operating without a license could trigger fines of up to $1,000. Enforcement would fall to the Kane County Sheriff\u2019s Office, according to the publication.\nNot everyone is satisfied. One community member urged county leaders this week to halt the measure, arguing it effectively legitimizes short-term rentals rather than curbing them. County officials counter that an outright ban wouldn\u2019t touch existing rentals and would leave them unregulated.\nAfter clearing the Executive Committee on Wednesday, the ordinance \u2014 as well as companion measures on noise and trespassing \u2014 are now headed to the full board.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

An affiliate of Blackrock sold the one-story structure at 42701 and 42735 Christy Street.\nThe Christy Street industrial building was built in 1991 and spans 253,500 square feet. Current tenants include electronics manufacturing services provider Sanmina and\ndata center\nliquid cooling system provider DeepCoolAI.\n\u201cThe explosive growth of the AI, power management, electric vehicle, aerospace and defense industries has generated significant and enduring demand for institutional-quality industrial space across Silicon Valley,\u201d Michael Alderman, managing director at Tishman Speyer, said in a press release. \u201cWe were drawn to Christy Street as a part of our core plus strategy for its strong in-place tenancy, quality floorplate, substantial power and parking and the opportunity to gain a foothold in the supply-constrained Fremont submarket.\u201d\nThe purchase marks another industrial space buy in Fremont, which is emerging as a hotspot for such space in the East Bay and the Bay Area at large.\nIn June, Prologis, the world\u2019s largest owner, operator and developer of industrial real estate, purchased an empty 177,000-square-foot commercial and industrial building at\n5555 Auto Mall Parkway\nfor $59 million. The following month,\nconstruction began on the Campus at Bayside\n, an industrial complex spanning 473,250 square feet being developed by CBRE, Clarion Partners and 9th Street Partners.\nSan Francisco-based Prologis previously bought a 246,000-square-foot industrial and research building at 48350 Fremont Boulevard in August 2023 from Blackstone for $86.6 million. Later that month, Irvine-based CIP Real Estate\nbought the 352,300-square-foot Clipper Court Commerce Center\nindustrial park in Fremont for $103.5 million.\nTishman Speyer is active in the Bay Area, developing the Mission Rock office and retail hub in San Francisco\u2019s Mission Bay neighborhood. The global firm also owns industrial real estate within the city of San Francisco. In 2023, Tishman Speyer\nbought a nearly 2.9-acre industrial site\nnear San Francisco\u2019s Bayview neighborhood for almost $32.3 million. The acquisition of 2225 Jerrold Avenue was the first completed through the company\u2019s\nTishman Speyer-Mitsui Fudosan America logistics joint venture\n.\n",

        "content": "Federal regulators are circling an Austin-based real estate operator already under siege from investors.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Alan Stalcup, founder and CEO of GVA Real Estate Group, following a wave of lawsuits alleging he misappropriated as much as $100 million from investors. The Austin American-Statesman\nreported\nthat the probe adds a new layer of risk for the multifamily debt syndicator.\nThe existence of the SEC investigation surfaced after Jackson Walker, a law firm representing a family\nsuing Stalcup for fraud\n, disclosed it had been served with an SEC subpoena in October seeking documents tied to the case. According to the outlet, a Texas judge later ordered the records turned over to law enforcement.\nWhile the SEC does not publicly confirm investigations, an attorney for Jackson Walker wrote in a court filing that \u201cbased on the SEC subpoena, it appears the SEC is investigating Mr. Stalcup for securities fraud.\u201d\nStalcup previously told the publication that he welcomed an SEC investigation into what he described as \u201cdefamatory fictions\u201d in the lawsuits.\nFounded in 2015, GVA operates as a property manager and\ndebt syndicator\n, pooling investor capital to acquire underperforming apartment complexes. Many of those investment vehicles are registered with the SEC as securities.\nCourt filings say Stalcup and GVA own or operate roughly 150 apartment properties, primarily in Texas, Tennessee and Kentucky. According to his firm\u2019s website, it has acquired 43,000 units across nine states and closed $10 billion in transactions since its founding.\nLegal trouble accelerated last year as rising interest rates strained floating-rate debt and exposed cracks in GVA\u2019s capital stack. In June, Barry Sternlicht\u2019s Starwood Capital\nsued Stalcup\n, accusing him of mismanaging three properties and allowing\nliens to pile up\nin violation of loan guarantees. In February, Benefit Street Partners filed suit in New York, alleging Stalcup misappropriated insurance proceeds, commingled tenant funds and engaged in other misconduct.\nAcross more than half a dozen lawsuits, investors claim Stalcup blurred the lines between properties and treated company accounts like a \u201cpersonal piggy bank.\u201d One complaint filed by attorneys for investor Brian Kastleman alleges more than $38 million was spent on personal expenses, including private jet travel, yacht charters and luxury vehicles. Other suits accuse GVA of inflating rental income and falsifying financials to mask deteriorating performance.\nOne filing alleges that in 2023 alone, GVA overstated rental income across its portfolio by more than $20.6 million. Another accuses Stalcup of improperly moving $650,000 between accounts tied to different properties he controlled, according to the publication.\nStalcup has pushed back, filing several counterclaims, including one that accuses Kastleman of trying to tank GVA\u2019s reputation to claw back capital.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The California Department of Real Estate is\nsettling\nits case against Real Estate Trainers\u00a0 Inc. and its former president, Lance McHarg.\nUnder the agreement, McHarg and Real Estate Trainers Incorporated, founded in 1972 by Bob Morris and McHarg\u2019s father Larry McHarg, must pay $60,000 for monetary penalties, damages, and the costs of investigation and litigation which led to the legal action, the Department of Real Estate\nsaid\nin a press release.\nThe disciplinary action has to do with McHarg taking\nCalifornia\n\u2019s real estate license exam numerous times without receiving a passing score. The Department of Real Estate conducted an investigation into the matter and concluded that McHarg had purposely done so to lift the information from the exams for educational materials offered by his Real Estate Trainers Incorporated for\nstudents\npreparing to take the state\u2019s\nreal estate license exam\n.\nAs part of the settlement, McHarg is barred for three years from applying for, taking, or participating in any way in an examination for a\nCalifornia real estate\nlicense and is prohibited from holding any position of employment, instructor, management, control or ownership in a real estate business or a business that offers pre-license, continuing education or any type of real estate license exam preparation courses. McHarg himself is barred from holding a real estate license, according to the press release. The state Department of Real Estate does not list McHarg as having a license, and the Secretary of State\u2019s website still lists Real Estate Trainers\u2019 business as active.\nReal Estate Trainers Incorporated and all of its affiliated employees are also barred for three years from applying for, taking or any type of participation in any examination for a California real estate license, as well as offering any type of real estate license exam preparation course or pre-license course that uses questions copied or subverted from Department of Real Estate license exams. The settlement also requires that McHarg be removed as an affiliate of Real Estate Trainers Incorporated.\n\u201cThe subversion of real estate license examination content is something [the Department of Real Estate] takes very seriously,\u201d Jeff Oboyski, head of the department\u2019s licensing division, which includes the education and research and examination administration sections, said. \u201cEnsuring that those who attempt to compromise the integrity of our real estate license exams are held accountable for their actions underscores [the Department of Real Estate\u2019s] commitment to consumer protection.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A proposed 5 percent tax on billionaires in California is propelling another wave of wealth to South Florida.\nLook no further than Google co-founder Larry Page, one of the three wealthiest men in the world, who recently spent a\ncombined $173 million\nto buy two waterfront homes in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove.\nPage\u2019s purchases aren\u2019t shocking. In addition to the proposed California tax, ultra high-net worth buyers have for decades been attracted to Florida for its lack of state income tax, conservative politics and pleasant weather. The region is already home to billionaires, who include Amazon founder\nJeff Bezos\n, PayPal co-founder\nPeter Thiel\nand hedge funder\nKen Griffin\n. To keep their Florida residency, they only need to spend six months and a day in the Sunshine State.\nAnd more are considering moves to South Florida, brokers and other industry insiders say.\nFellow Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who was also shopping for a Miami abode, made an offer to buy a waterfront house in Miami Beach for about $50 million, sources told\nThe Real Deal.\nBrin is buying LVMH Americas Chairman &amp; CEO Michael Burke\u2019s Allison Island home.\nInterest picked up in early December, around Art Basel, according to brokers. That\u2019s when Brin arrived in Miami via his $450 million megayacht Dragonfly, which was docked in Biscayne Bay.\n\u201cWe\u2019re showing property almost every single day,\u201d said Douglas Elliman agent Devin Kay.\nLuxe Living Realty broker Dora Puig said the spike in interest from Californians is \u201cfoundationally strong.\u201d That includes prospective buyers who made their fortune in cryptocurrency, she said.\nThe billionaires, primarily from California but also other parts of the country, are looking from Miami to Palm Beach, where a number of large deals have closed recently as well: In December, fintech billionaire Ronald Clarke, chairman and CEO of Atlanta-based Corpay, purchased a 2.5-acre waterfront compound in North Palm Beach from William Wrigley Jr.\nfor $97.5 million\n. Another $72 million trade closed at the start of the year.\nDanny Hertzberg, of the top-ranked Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker, said he\u2019s the busiest he\u2019s been since the pandemic boom of 2021. Hertzberg is part of the team that represented the seller of the $101.5 million estate Page purchased. He declined to comment on the deal.\nHertzberg flew out to California after the wealth tax idea was first floated. The ballot measure would tax California residents worth more than $1 billion the equivalent of 5 percent of their assets. It still has to secure enough signatures to make it onto the November ballot, but if it passes, it would apply retroactively to anyone who lived in California as of Jan. 1, 2026.\n\u201cOur team has been quite busy. Everyone thought it was going to be a New York-Mamdani story, but it\u2019s been a California story,\u201d he said, referring to the \u201cexodus\u201d South Florida brokers predicted when Zohran Mamdani was elected mayor of New York in the fall. That\u2019s fallen short.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just L.A., San Francisco. It\u2019s every pocket of California that has high net-worth individuals,\u201d Hertzberg said. South Florida, Texas and Nevada will benefit most if the tax becomes a reality, he added.\nThe buyers are interested in properties at the very top of the market. Coconut Grove has benefitted from the boom already \u2014 in addition to Page\u2019s buys, a mystery buyer spent over $100 million in the same Miami neighborhood, on another waterfront property that\nbillionaire Jorge Mas sold in December.\nKay of Elliman said he\u2019s starting to see a bump in activity spill over into big-ticket contracts for ultra-luxury condos at the Four Seasons Residences at the Surf Club. The luxury condo market has performed less consistently than the waterfront single-family homes, but the Surfside development and its sister projects have attracted a Who\u2019s Who of buyers for years.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing that across all of our business,\u201d he said.\n",

        "content": "An Alabama-based insurance brokerage is betting on North Dallas office space, rolling four local offices into a single hub at a prominent building near Central Expressway.\nCRC Group signed a 49,000-square-foot lease at Lakeside Square, the 18-story office building at 12377 Merit Drive. The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat the deal brings occupancy at the 409,544-square-foot building to about 85 percent and adds more than 200 employees to the property by March 2026, with some staff already in place.\nThe move consolidates CRC\u2019s Dallas-Fort Worth presence into one site. CRC Insurance Services, the operating arm of the group, is an independent brokerage focused on specialty insurance underwriting across the U.S. and Canada. The firm was founded in 1982 in Birmingham, Alabama, and was previously known as TIH Insurance Holdings.\nLakeside Square sits at the crossroads of U.S. 75 and I-635, near\nMedical City Dallas\n, a Costco and a growing cluster of apartments \u2014 a site that\u2019s long appealed to back office and financial services users. Built in 1985, the blue-glass building has its own Dallas lore: It originally served as headquarters for Ross Perot\u2019s Perot Systems and even included a helipad. Perot later decamped to Plano, where his former Electronic Data Systems campus is now being redeveloped as\nAT&amp;T\u2019s global headquarters\n.\nNew York-based\nAcram Group\nhas owned Lakeside Square since late 2018 and has poured more than $10 million into upgrades, including revamped landscaping, a renovated lobby, a fitness center and a tenant lounge. The building also features a boutique cafe and coffee bar, amenities landlords are increasingly leaning on to lure tenants back to the office.\nCRC joins a roster that includes Aethon Energy Management, Audacy and personal injury firm Sweet James. Audacy and Sweet James were among several tenants that signed deals at the building in late 2024, helping reposition the offices.\nJLL\u2019s Gini Rounsaville and Trevor Franke represented Acram in the CRC lease, while Lincoln Property Co.\u2019s Kyle Stanich and JLL\u2019s Conor McCarthy and Taylor Dickerson handled the lease for CRC. Rounsaville said the move reflects sustained demand for high-quality office space in North Dallas.\nThat demand is showing up in the data. A recent JLL report found the\nNorth Dallas\nsubmarket has logged roughly 2.9 million square feet of financial services leasing since 2020, outpacing Uptown and Las Colinas.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Texas luxury is settling into a new normal after booming during the pandemic.\nSales volume, median price, inventory and days on market all describe a luxury market that\u2019s growing, just not as rapidly as it was a few years ago, according to data released by Texas Realtors on transactions that took place between November 2024 to October 2025. The five-year trajectory of the Texas luxury market points to a return to pre-pandemic levels as volume swells at a more consistent rate.\nThe number of home sales over $1 million hit the highest level on record in Texas last year. More than 14,400 homes over $1 million sold in 2025, dethroning the period from November 2021 to October 2022, when almost 14,000 homes above $1 million sold.\nThe state has reached a new high water mark for luxury sales almost every year since 2015. The steadiness of the state\u2019s growth was interrupted in 2021 and 2022, when Texas saw a whopping 90 percent increase in home sales above $1 million. That growth slowed rapidly in 2023 when the luxury market abruptly posted a 16 percent decline in million-dollar home sales from the year before \u2014 the only statewide decline in sales in the last decade.\nThe growth rate of million-dollar home sales in 2025 resembles pre-pandemic conditions. In 2018, million-dollar home sales grew by 11.5 percent. Last year, they grew by 12 percent.\nThe market showed other signs of slowing, as months supply and days on market increased in 2025. Both metrics have been on the rise since 2021.\nFrom 2024 to 2025, inventory rose slightly from 8.1 to 8.3 months supply. The average luxury home also spent 72 days on the market last year, four days slower than 2024.\nThe third-most expensive residential sale in Dallas\nthis year, a 15,7000-square-foot six-eight at\n1 Dorset Place\n, sold in 72 days.\nWhile the market is slowing, it\u2019s not stalling. Before 2021, when inventory plunged below 4 months supply and the average million-dollar home sold in just 55 days, Texas luxury homes generally took at least 80 days to sell, and months supply reached double-digit levels.\nThe growth in inventory from 2024 to 2025 is the flattest change between years since the last decade, indicating a settling ratio of buyers to sellers.\nThe average price per square foot of Texas homes above $1 million rose five dollars to $423 last year. Meanwhile, the average price per square foot of all Texas homes decreased from $190 to $188.\n",

If the product is less desirable, even in this type of market, it just sits there.\nThat phenomenon was seen in the strong sales figures a number of newer buildings posted, said Stephen Kliegerman, president of Brown Harris Stevens Marketing Development. On the other hand, when buyers can\u2019t find a suitable condo, they haven\u2019t been taking the next best thing.\n\u201cBuyers are waiting a little bit to have either product in locations that they\u2019re more interested in, or sizes or price points,\u201d he said.\nBoth Manhattan and Brooklyn felt the inventory squeeze.\nIn Manhattan, contract signings fell 12 percent annually to just over 1,400, according to BHSDM. Despite the dip in contracts, total inventory in the borough fell roughly 13 percent to just under 3,600.\nThe deal volume in the borough fell by 3 percent to $6.5 billion, driven by what BHSDM estimates is nearly $1 billion in sales at\n80 Clarkson\n, the ultra-luxury downtown offering from Atlas Capital Group and Zeckendorf Development. In December, the building inked a\n$129 million deal\nfor multiple units, which would be a downtown record if it closes at that price.\nThe building has yet to report sales numbers, but even adding in its estimated contracts makes a dull 2025 look only so much rosier.\nIn Brooklyn, there were just over 1,000 new development contracts signed, 6 percent down from 2024, according to BHSDM. At the same time, the supply of new condos in the borough fell 19 percent yearly to just above 1,300.\nUnlike Manhattan, where pricing has been nearly flat over the last 10 years, Brooklyn\u2019s price per square foot rose 44 percent in that time to $1,385, driven by an outsize number of sales occurring at pricey waterfront developments like Two Trees\u2019 condominium at\nOne Domino Square\nand Naftali Group\u2019s residential offering at\nOne Williamsburg Wharf\n.\nA surprise top performer\nBuyers looking for something new found it, in a way, at\n125 Greenwich Street\n, the top-selling building in the city in 2025, according to Marketproof.\nKnown as The Greenwich, the 272-unit condominium re-launched sales in 2024 following a turnover in the development team and a building rebrand in 2023.\nA Douglas Elliman Development Marketing Team led by Stacey Spielman put 64 units into contract in 2025, according to Marketproof. The sales efforts likely benefitted from steep price drops, with newly listed units asking on average 25 percent less than they were before 2023.\nBut the building also hit some noteworthy milestones, selling its first handful of units asking at least $4 million, including a 79th-floor asking $5 million, or roughly $3,000 per square foot, according to Marketproof.\nGlacier Equities and InterVest Capital Partners\u2019 project at\n720 West End Avenue\nnetted 59 contracts, right behind The Greenwich.\nBoth buildings\u2019 success this year proved \u201cthat once you find your price point things do move quickly,\u201d according to Kliegerman.\nIn Brooklyn, One Domino Square scored 49 contracts for over $130 million, according to the report from BHSDM.\nNo reprieve in sight\nDespite the lackluster numbers in 2025, there\u2019s no sign that 2026 \u2014 or even 2027 \u2014 will be any better for buyers.\nIn Manhattan, BHSDM projects an average of just under 1,300 units to come online in each of the next two years, less than the total contracts signed this past year.\nIn Brooklyn, the situation is even more stark. In the next two years, BHSDM projects an average of roughly 580 units to be delivered, despite the borough averaging over 1,000 contracts per year.\nIf deal numbers fall short again in 2026 though, don\u2019t blame buyers, said Kliegerman.\n\u201cWe believe very, very firmly that there\u2019s a lot of demand for product, but that the lack of new product is actually creating less transactions, not that buyers aren\u2019t interested in purchasing,\u201d he said.\n",

The decision came after Garodnick was seemingly passed over for a deputy mayor post with Zohran Mamdani\u2019s administration.\nIn an email to his staff, Garodnick said that \u201cthe time is right for me to move on.\u201d He plans on staying on to support the transition to whoever takes his place.\n\u201cI do not take my departure lightly,\u201d Garodnick added.\nA spokesperson for Mamdani confirmed Garodnick\u2019s pending departure, but did not comment any further on the decision.\nEric Adams appointed Garodnick as director of the Department of City Planning and chair of the City Planning Commission\nin 2022\n. Garodnick guided several of Adams\u2019 biggest housing policies, including passage of the City of Yes and the Midtown South rezoning.\nPrior to his time with the planning department, Garodnick was a Manhattan City Councilmember for 12 years. He helped negotiate Blackstone and Ivanhoe Cambridge\u2019s $5.3 billion purchase of Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village in 2015, which required the owners to keep 5,000 of the complex\u2019s apartments affordable for at least 20 years.\nHe also shepherded the\nrezoning of Midtown East\nthrough the city\u2019s arduous land use review process.\nWho takes Garodnick\u2019s post with the DCP and CPC will be closely watched by those in the real estate industry. The position is instrumental for development plans in the city, particularly in the realm of affordable housing.\nMamdani has promised to construct 200,000 affordable units in the next decade.\nDina Levy, the senior vice president of single family and community development with the state\u2019s Division of Homes and Community Renewal,\nrecently\nlanded the nomination as commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Meritage Homes is pursuing a rezoning of a 30-acre site it has under contract in Wellington, with preliminary plans for a 206-townhome complex.\nThe Scottsdale, Arizona-based homebuilder proposes the project for the six-lot site at 16300, 16350 and 16426 Velazquez Road, and at 16275, 16301 and 16421 Rembrandt Road, near\nLion Country Safari\n, the South Florida Business Journal\nreported\n. Meritage, led by Phillippe Lord, filed the rezoning and master plan application in November.\nEach townhome lot would range from 1,800 square feet to 2,100 square feet.\nThe Wellington Planning and Zoning Board and Village Council are to each vote on the project. The proposal hasn\u2019t been scheduled for a meeting yet.\nMeritage\u2019s filing comes as more rural areas of Palm Beach County are experiencing redevelopment, primarily with housing complexes. The area is one of the few sections of South Florida with enough land supply for more sprawled communities.\nWestlake, the county\u2019s youngest municipality that incorporated in 2016, is in a western part of the county. Master developer Minto Communities has approvals for\nthousands of homes\n, commercial space, a school and police and fire stations. Minto bought the\n4,000-acre\nsite for Westlake in 2013.\nIn Palm Beach Gardens, the 4,800-acre master-planned Avenir is taking shape on the northwest corner of Northlake and Coconut boulevards. It has approvals for 3,900 residential units, mostly single-family homes, plus a 300-key hotel, 200,000 square feet for medical offices, 400,000 square feet for retail and a 2,400-acre nature preserve. Coral Gables-based Landstar is the master developer,\nselling off\npieces of the Avenir assemblage to homebuilders in recent years.\nAnother master-planned Palm Beach County community is the 1,200-acre\nArden\n, near Wellington. It is approved for 2,300 homes and is billed as an \u201cagrihood\u201d complex due to a 5-acre farm that allows residents to grow and harvest produce.\nLennar has invested over\n$226 million\nfor homesites in Arden.\n\u2013\u2013\nLidia Dinkova\n",

        "content": "Wilmette was busier than usual in 2025, and not just by North Shore standards.\nHome sales in the lakefront suburb jumped more than 20 percent last year, according to an analysis of preliminary year-end sales records\nreported\nby Crain\u2019s, putting Wilmette among a small group of Chicago-area communities that defied an otherwise flat housing market. Agents on the ground told the outlet that the surge was palpable, even compared to nearby high-end enclaves.\nLisa Finks for instance, a Compass agent who works across several North Shore towns, told the publication that sales volume in Wilmette seemed much busier than in other areas.\nWilmette\nwas among nine suburbs and city neighborhoods where home sales rose sharply in 2025, Crain\u2019s reported, bucking a metro-area market that barely moved. Across the nine-county region, sales ended the year up just 0.2 percent from 2024 \u2014 essentially flat \u2014 which itself was the slowest year for Chicago-area home sales since 2011. Final numbers could shift slightly once final year-end Illinois Realtors data is released, but the broader picture remains one of stagnation.\nAlongside Wilmette, several Chicago neighborhoods posted notable gains, including Little Village, where sales climbed 24 percent, Avondale at 19 percent, and\nHumboldt Park\nand South Shore at roughly 13 percent, each. Suburban standouts included Plainfield, Flossmoor, Schaumburg and Glen Ellyn, all up by double digits.\nA common thread across many of these pockets is relative affordability, especially as buyers grapple with elevated interest rates and years of price appreciation. In\nSouth Shore\n, for example, the median sale price in November was $185,000, according to Redfin, compared with $230,000 in Hyde Park and $276,000 in\nKenwood\n.\n\u201cSouth Shore is still one of the few areas where prices make sense in today\u2019s interest rate environment,\u201d said Greg Faulkner of the Howell-Faulkner Group at Re/Max Premier.\nEven Wilmette benefits from a perception of value, at least within its peer group. The suburb is seen as more attainable than other New Trier Township communities, Finks said, with median home prices just under $1.3 million, compared with about $1.7 million in Glencoe and more than $2 million in Winnetka.\nBeyond price, Wilmette\u2019s strong schools, walkable village center and transit access have regained importance, as remote work fades and daily commutes matter again, Fink told the publication.\nThe broader market, meanwhile, remains constrained by historically tight inventory. Many owners are staying put, locked into low-rate mortgages.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Hollingsworth and Alemayehu Mergia to reverse the sale of the 83-foot-long, 7-foot-wide unpaved dirt alley, the San Francisco Standard\nreported\n.\nIt all started last spring when the couple received a letter from the San Francisco treasurer\u2019s office that advertised an auction on pieces of land where owners had failed to pay their property taxes. The parcels for sale were \u201crendered unusable by their size, location, or other conditions\u201d with bidding starting at $1.\nHollingsworth and Mergia believed they were competing for a neighboring home at 1926 Kirkham Street, submitted a bid for $25,000 as well as an additional $8,000\ntransfer tax\n, taking the money out of their retirement funds to put in the offer. After celebrating their successful purchase at the sealed-bid auction, they realized that they had actually bought the alley next to their home officially referred to on Google Maps as \u201cDirt Alley,\u201d rather than the building next door.\nLast month, Hollingsworth reached out to Wong\u2019s office, asking the newly appointed Sunset supervisor to \u201crepresent me on a recent \u2018street fight\u2019 in San Francisco which needs immediate resolution with the [San Francisco] Board of Supervisors.\u201d\nThough Hollingsworth and Mergia don\u2019t have to have Wong by their side to bring their case before the board and ask it to overturn the sale, they believe having Wong\u2019s support \u2014 and vote \u2014 will bolster their case.\nA spokesperson for the San Francisco tax collector, which organized the sale, said the office doesn\u2019t have a position on undoing the transaction, which has only happened once before in 2017 when homeowners in\nPresidio Terrace\nsuccessfully reversed the $90,000 sale of a street in their gated neighborhood to a\nSan Jose\ncouple.\n\u201cLet\u2019s just get this done,\u201d Hollingsworth told the Standard. \u201cIt would be an opportunity for [Wong] to prove that he can represent a constituent in the right way, see through this bullshit and fix it.\u201d\nWong\u2019s office will likely meet with the couple in person to explain the process in the coming weeks. A majority of supervisors would have to vote to overturn the sale.\n\u201cSupervisor Wong is committed to serving and representing the residents of District 4,\u201d his office said in a statement, per the Standard. \u201cIf the constituent ultimately wishes to pursue a request to rescind the sale, the supervisor\u2019s office stands ready to assist them through the appropriate process with the Board of Supervisors.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Charles Cohen can\u2019t do right by his creditor, Fortress Investment Group.\nThis week, Cohen sold the office building at 3 East 54th Street in the Plaza District to Vornado Realty Trust for $141 million, Bisnow\nreported\n. Steven Roth\u2019s firm applied the $107 million debt it bought against the property over the last two years towards the purchase of the building, which it plans to raze.\nThe sale would seem to be good news for Cohen, who is scrambling to raise cash after a New York judge ordered him to\nrepay $187 million\npersonally guaranteed to Fortress.\nBut the final sale price proved to be a pittance compared to what once was. In court documents this summer, Cohen Brothers Realty claimed it agreed to sell the property to an unnamed buyer\nfor $188 million\n. The funds were expected to arrive by international wire transfer.\nThey never did, though, leaving Cohen with few options to sell the 300,000-square-foot building, in which it owned a 63 percent stake. In stepped Vornado, which moved quickly to finalize the transaction. It\u2019s expected to generate $30 million to pay down the judgment, according to the firm representing Cohen.\nIn a letter to a judge, attorneys for Fortress said the deal was a \u201cvery far cry from satisfying the judgment debt,\u201d claiming the creditor was blindsided by the deal. The company wants to subpoena Cohen for financial records and have a pair of properties put into receivership.\nFortress declined to comment to the publication, while Cohen did not respond to a request for comment.\nCohen also recently sold 623 Fifth Avenue to Vornado for $218 million. That sale was expected to generate $70 million towards paying the debt to Fortress, but only $30 million has been provided to the creditor from that deal so far, according to court filings.\nFortress has been trying to recoup more than $500 million it says Cohen defaulted on. The private equity giant has accused him of shifting assets \u2014 including his Connecticut home and 220-foot yacht \u2014 into his wife\u2019s name, allegations Cohen denies.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The walls are closing in on a once prominent condo deconversion team.\nStrategic Properties of North America, led by Saul Kupperwasser and Yitzy Klor, is facing foreclosure on its Skokie office building. The firm is based in Skokie and Lakewood, New Jersey.\nAttorneys for Byline Bank this week filed a foreclosure complaint against SPNA for a promissory note that has allegedly been in default since August.\nByline alleges that the bank issued a $496,000 note to Kupperwasser and Klor in 2017, but in August they stopped making payments. Byline alleges the duo currently owe $340,000 on the loan.\nAbout the same time that the pair took out the promissory note, they also secured a $397,000 mortgage from Byline on their one-story, 5,400-square-foot Illinois office property at 5009 Oakton Street in Skokie.\nByline is now requesting that a judge order a judicial sale of the building to pay back the note.\nKupperwasser, Klor and attorneys for Byline did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe filing is the latest sign that SPNA is facing mounting financial trouble. The condo deconversion specialists had two proposed purchases fall through in recent years due to lack of financing.\nThe company bought dozens of condos at the 467-unit Ontario Place in Chicago\u2019s River North, but after three years of negotiations,\nfailed to close a $190 million purchase of the remaining units\n. The deal imploded in June 2023 when SPNA failed to put up $700,000 as a show of good faith to the remaining sellers.\nIn 2024, SPNA fumbled a second condo deconversion at\na condo building at 200 North Dearborn\nin Chicago. The condo board voted to terminate an agreement with SPNA to sell the remaining units for $90 million, after the company failed repeatedly to secure the financing needed to close the deal.\nSPNA also recently sold an apartment building at a loss, while listing another for sale.\nLaramar Group\nbought SPNA\u2019s Wave Lakeview apartments for $57 million last month.\nThe seller last refinanced the property for $62 million in 2019, public records show. SPNA converted the nearly 60-year-old building from condos to apartments in 2017 and took out a $46 million loan from Ladder Capital to help fund the deconversion, according to public records. It\u2019s unclear how much total capital SPNA put into the deconversion of the 30-story, 207-unit Wave Lakeview at 420 West Belmont, or if the company paid down the principal on its latest $62 million note from MF1 before selling the property to Laramar last month.\nPrior to the sale, the building had faced its share of challenges. Loan records indicate Wave Lakeview struggled to generate income for SPNA while the company owned and operated it.\u00a0 When SPNA refinanced the property with MF1 in 2019, the lender bundled the $62 million debt into a collateralized loan obligation package, public records show. Doing so made some of the loan\u2019s details public.\nThe loan was watchlisted by its servicer in May 2021 for having a debt-to-service coverage ratio under 1, meaning the building\u2019s income was not covering its operating costs, according to commercial debt tracker MorningStar Credit. It was later removed from the watchlist in August 2021 when SPNA secured an extension on the loan. More recent details of the loan are harder to determine because MF1 appears to have taken the debt off the public market at some point in 2022.\nIn October, the company\nlisted the K Square Apartments\nin Chicago\u2019s Lincoln Park. SPNA converted the 22-story, 268-unit property from condos to rentals in 2018, and listed the building for sale in 2023 with CBRE, before eventually taking it off the market. It is now listed with Berkadia brokers Nick Harris, Pete Evans and Richard Evans.",

        "content": "Texas put its signature on one of its biggest economic development wins yet under a new incentive regime, officially clearing the way for Eli Lilly\u2019s $6.5 billion manufacturing plant in northeast Houston.\nThe final Jobs, Energy, Technology and Innovation Act tax agreement that lured the pharmaceutical giant to Houston was posted to the state comptroller\u2019s website this week, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n. The deal caps a fast-moving courtship that began less than a year ago, when Eli Lilly first applied for the\nincentive program\nand\npublicly disclosed\nits interest in the region.\nThe global drugmaker plans to build the massive facility on 236 acres within McCord Development\u2019s Generation Park, a 4,300-acre master-planned industrial park off Beltway 8 near George Bush Intercontinental Airport and the Port of Houston. The plant will manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients, including orforglipron, Lilly\u2019s closely watched\noral GLP-1 drug\naimed at treating obesity.\nThe agreement offers a clearer look at the economics behind the splashy announcement.\nLilly committed to paying an average annual wage of $102,503, exceeding 110 percent of the benchmark for its NAICS pharmaceutical manufacturing category. The company said the plant will ultimately create more than 600 high-paying jobs, with an initial requirement of 75 jobs and $200 million in investment by the first year of the incentive period. The project will create 4,000 construction jobs for the duration of its buildout.\nMcCord Development will invest $100 million in infrastructure upgrades, while Lilly will handle the buildings, as previously reported by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nTo secure the deal, Sheldon Independent School District agreed to exempt the property from school taxes through 2030, then cap the taxable value at 50 percent for another decade. The district\u2019s board signed off in November, and Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s office added its signature on Jan. 5, finalizing the agreement after a joint announcement with Lilly last fall.\nThe timing of construction remains murky. While the incentive paperwork lists a Sept. 1, 2025 construction start date, no visible signs of work existed following Abbott\u2019s Sept. 23 announcement. Eli Lilly told the outlet this week that it does not have an update on the timeline.\nThe project is part of Eli Lilly\u2019s broader push to onshore U.S. manufacturing.\nCEO David Ricks\nhas pointed to permanently lowered federal corporate tax rates as a tailwind for \u201cintellectual property-driven\u201d businesses, though he has downplayed the role of state incentives alone. Houston beat out a \u201cvery competitive\u201d runner-up, he said, thanks to workforce quality, available space and a collaborative local government culture.\nThose factors are baked into Generation Park\u2019s pitch. The development is home to San Jacinto College\u2019s Center for Biotechnology, creating a direct training pipeline for pharmaceutical manufacturing jobs, with Sheldon ISD already feeding students into the program.\nWhile Houston lacks a deep biotech labor pool, the city has become home to an adjacent life sciences sector, with more than\n700 life science\ncompanies making Houston home.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The fallout from\nLuxUrban Hotels\u2019 spectacular unraveling\nis no longer confined to courtrooms, creditors and locked hotel doors. For a former executive, it\u2019s turning personal.\nBrian Ferdinand, the founder and former chief executive of the short-lived hotel operator, filed for Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy last month, seeking a clean break from nearly $100 million in liabilities tied largely to the company\u2019s failed New York City hotel leases. Ferdinand reported less than $4.5 million in assets against more than $98 million in debt, according to the filing, first reported by\nBisnow\n.\nAt the core of the wreckage are the personal guarantees Ferdinand signed as LuxUrban raced to scale up its master-lease model across Manhattan. Those guarantees left him directly on the hook for tens of millions of dollars after the company stopped paying rent and landlords moved to enforce their claims.\nFerdinand owes $28 million to MAve Hotel Investors, which owns Hotel 27 on Madison Avenue, $6.4 million to the owner of The Herald near Herald Square and $14.2 million tied to the Tuscany Hotel, court records show.\nThe list of creditors reads like a cross-section of LuxUrban\u2019s most troubled deals. Ferdinand also disclosed a $19 million obligation to Wyndham Hotel Group stemming from an abandoned partnership, a $2.7 million judgment related to a defaulted lease at 123 Washington Street and nearly $4 million owed to merchant cash advance lenders.\nHe reported 18 lawsuits filed against him in the year before the bankruptcy, most connected to breached loan or lease guarantees, along with $148,000 in unpaid federal taxes from 2023.\nFinancially, the filing portrays a dramatic reversal. Ferdinand says he is unemployed, with no income, less than $170 in cash across three bank accounts and a repossessed Porsche Cayenne. He is receiving a $30,000 monthly allowance from his father. His biggest remaining asset is a Sunny Isles Beach condo valued at $4.4 million, though it is encumbered by $5.7 million in mortgages.\nFerdinand launched CorpHousing Group in 2017, initially leasing apartments for short-term stays before pivoting during the pandemic to master leasing hotels. That strategy powered a $13 million initial public offering in 2022 and a rebrand to LuxUrban Hotels, pitching the company as a fast-growing disruptor in hospitality.\nThe ambition outpaced the balance sheet. After a short seller report and mounting lawsuits, LuxUrban filed for Chapter 11 in September, only to\ncollapse into Chapter 7 liquidation\nweeks later after abandoning hotels, workers and\nbooked guests\n.\nThough Ferdinand had stepped away from day-to-day leadership, the company\u2019s court-appointed trustee is seeking to pull him back into the liquidation, arguing that only he can produce key financial records.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A Pompano Beach apartment building traded for $41 million, marking a slight discount from its price four years ago, while a Boca Raton rental complex sold for $30 million.\nGreenwood Village, Colorado-based Griffis Residential bought the eight-story, 144-unit building at 275 North Federal Highway in Pompano Beach from Montreal-based Frankforter Group, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The buyer borrowed $29.5 million from Chicago-based PPM America for the purchase.\nAlso, Matthew Paul\u2019s MAP Communities bought the 106-unit Boca Villa Apartments complex at 100 West Hidden Valley Boulevard in Boca Raton from Edwidge Realty and Marina &amp; Briana limited partnerships. MAP took over a $32.5 million loan on the complex, with a $28.5 million balance, provided by Greenwich, Connecticut-based lender Ellington Financial.\nThe deals come at a dubious time for South Florida\u2019s multifamily market. While\nleaseups\nhave taken a hit due to hefty completions in recent years and a slower influx of out-of-staters, landlords also have felt the sting from elevated interest rates and increases in other costs such as insurance, leading some to sell at a discount.\nThe Pompano Beach building was completed in 2019 on a 0.8-acre site, property records show.\u00a0 Frankforter, led by Yaakov Frankforter, paid\n$42.9 million\nfor the building in 2021, meaning the recent sale marked a 4.3 percent discount from the 2021 price.\nThe building, called Griffis Pompano Beach, consists of one-bedroom units to three-bedroom units, with monthly rents ranging from $2,175 to more than $2,895, according to the property\u2019s website.\nThe Boca Raton complex sits on 7.2 acres. It was completed in two phases. The first five two-story buildings with 53 units, combined, were finished in 1988. In 2021, another 53 units were completed in one three-story building and one five-story building.\nBoca Villa Apartments consists of one-bedroom units to three-bedroom units, Vizzda records show. Rents aren\u2019t listed.\nGriffis, led by Ian Griffis and David Birnbaum, is a multifamily owner and manager with a portfolio of 30 communities spanning 9,000 units across 13 national markets, according to its website. It has ramped up its South Florida investment.\nIn June, Griffis paid\n$87 million\nfor the 15-story, 223-unit apartment building at 345 Banyan Boulevard in downtown West Palm Beach.\nMAP Communities was founded in March by Paul, who previously was vice president for Florida at single-family rental homes developer Christopher Todd Communities, according to his LinkedIn. MAP has focused its investment in South Florida, amassing a portfolio of about six properties since it was founded.\nIn other recent South Florida multifamily deals, Ortsac Capital Group bought the 206-unit Ventura Pointe complex at 7850 Pasadena Boulevard in Pembroke Pines for\n$52.5 million\nlast month. It marked a 5.6 percent discount from the property\u2019s 2019 price.\nAlso last month, Greystar and Artemis Real Estate Partners bought the 220-unit age-restricted Everleigh Palm Beach Gardens complex at 3660 RCA Boulevard in Palm Beach Gardens for\n$69.4 million\n.\n",

        "content": "The hangover from the craft beer boom has turned into a legal headache for Steve Soble, owner of District Brew Yards.\nWaterman Bank filed a foreclosure suit against the ownership entity of the\nrecently shuttered beer hall\u2019s Wheeling outpost\n, alleging the borrower owes more than $2.3 million in unpaid principal, interest and fees. The complaint, filed in Cook County Circuit Court late last month, marks the latest distress signal in a local brewing scene that has seen a wave of closures from industry titans and neighborhood favorites alike.\nThe lawsuit targets 700 N Milwaukee LLC and its guarantors, Dale \u201cSteve\u201d Soble and wife Kendall Soble. Steve Soble, a 36-year veteran of the Chicago brewery and dining scene who also founded Burnt City Brewing, opened the Wheeling brewery in 2022 as a suburban expansion of his popular West Town concept. It allows District Brew Yards patrons to pour their own beers from a wall of taps.\nBut the taps ran dry quickly. According to Waterman\u2019s complaint, the borrower stopped making payments on the $2.3 million Wheeling loan in April 2024. While the two sides apparently attempted to salvage the deal through multiple forbearance agreements, the bank alleges the borrower defaulted again In August 2025, court records show.\nAs of last month, Waterman Bank claims the total payoff amount has swelled to more than $2.3 million, with interest accruing daily.\nThe foreclosure filing comes just months after Soble publicly announced a \u201cwind down\u201d of District Brew Yards\u2019 operations. In September, reports indicated the 11,900-square-foot Wheeling property at 700 North Milwaukee Avenue was being marketed for sale with an asking price of roughly $3.6 million. At the time, Soble cited a desire to retire and a difficult market as reasons for the exit.\nThe legal action suggests a buyer hasn\u2019t materialized at a price sufficient to clear the debt before the bank\u2019s patience ran out, but it remains on the market with CBRE brokers Tom Svoboda and Dominic Soltero. It is now asking $2.7 million, according to an online\nlisting\n. The West Town property in Chicago is still operating, but the property is also listed for sale asking $4.5 million.\nWaterman\u2019s foreclosure is emblematic of a broader crisis facing the middle market of the hospitality industry \u2014 full-service venues sandwiched between high-end dining and quick-serve chains.\n\u201cThere has been a real pullback in mid-level dining experiences that is not just craft beer-focused,\u201d Steve Soble told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cA lot of places on the high end are doing really well. The middle is being hollowed out.\u201d\nThe craft beer sector, once a darling of retail real estate, has been battered by a perfect storm of headwinds. Inflation has squeezed margins, but a cultural shift is proving even more damaging: Americans are simply drinking less.\nIndustry analysts have also pointed to the rise of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic, which can curb cravings for both food and alcohol, as a growing threat to revenue. Combined with the \u201cDry January\u201d movement extending year-round for many younger consumers, volume-dependent businesses like large beer halls are finding it harder to cover the rent.\nDistrict Brew Yards is far from alone in its struggles. Miskatonic Brewing\nshuttered its suburban Chicago location in Darien\nthis month, blaming the downturn on \u201cpeople drinking less\u201d and the financial strain of a failed expansion. That closure followed the\nhigh-profile exit of Lagunitas\n, which closed its large Chicago production facility and taproom in 2024 after a decade of operation.\nHowever, a\n$12 million foreclosure lawsuit\nfor the Great Central Brewing property on Chicago\u2019s Near West Side filed by Wheaton-based lender T2 Capital in 2023 was resolved without stripping the property from the borrowers. \u201cThe sponsor was resourceful and was able to recapitalize the property,\u201d T2\u2019s CEO Jeff Brown said Friday.\nDavid Avram, one of the original owners and borrowers for the Great Central property, took on several million dollars of additional debt tied to the brewery building over the past year in an attempt to straighten out the company\u2019s financial affairs, and T2\u2019s foreclosure was dismissed in early 2025, court records show.\nMeanwhile, Waterman Bank has requested a judgment of foreclosure and sale for the Wheeling District Brew Yards, as well as the right to appoint a receiver to take control of the property. An attorney for Waterman didn\u2019t return a request for comment. The lawsuit\u2019s next court date is scheduled for a June 29 case management hearing, online records show.\n",

        "content": "The long-shuttered Empire Theater in West Portal is facing the wrecking ball and a rebirth as a nine-story residential building.\nThe arts venue at 85 West Portal Avenue is\nslated for demolition\n, and local builder DM Development is plotting to build 64 residential units across nine floors at the site, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\nDM is acting as developer for a group led by Jesse Appleton, whose family has owned the theater for more than 100 years. Appleton and a partner bought it in 2021 from other family members following longtime operator Cinemark\u2019s abandoning its lease and closing the theater, ripping out seats, screens and projectors in the process.\n\u201cThe [former operator] mothballed it, stripped out all the equipment and just left it,\u201d Appleton told the Chronicle. While his group explored bringing the facility back as a theater, the building\u2019s poor condition and the opening of a multiplex nearby meant theater operators weren\u2019t interested in moving in. As a result, the team opted to build housing instead, planning for 62 two- and three-bedroom rental apartments at the site.\n\u201cWe want something that is going to endure. We want to stay in this long term. That is our goal,\u201d Appleton said.\nTo bring the project to life, developers will take advantage of two state laws that allow the structure to be taller and denser than currently allowed by zoning regulations.\nSenate Bill 330\ndoubles the permitted density on the site, and Assembly Bill 2011 requires a streamlined 90-day approval. Of the 64 units, 10 will be below market rate, with five affordable to households earning 50 percent of the area median income, and five units\u00a0 meant for households making 120 percent of the area median income. Groundbreaking is expected next year.\nHistoric theaters in San Francisco have been trading hands or floated for renovations or redevelopment over the past year.\nLast April, the San Francisco Planning Commission\napproved a zoning change\nfor the Alexandria Theater to allow for the construction of 75 housing units. In June, the fate of the\nClay Theatre\nwas revealed as its new ownership plots upgrades for 4K digital projection, 35mm film capabilities, new acoustics and accessibility improvements. And last month, the San Francisco Giants\npurchased the Curran Theatre\nfrom Shorenstein family scion Carole Shorenstein Hays.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The seller is a ranch company owned by the late Eugene Kincaid III, an accomplished amateur historian and heir of a historic ranching family.\nThe final sale price is unavailable, but seller\u2019s agent Robert Dullnig with Kuper Sotheby\u2019s International Realty had listed the property for $16.5 million. Seger\u2019s company, BC Frio 5000, secured a $13.5 million loan from Security State Bank and Trust for the purchase.\nAside from some irrigation wells and a 1,000-square-foot cabin, the land remains mostly unimproved, differing little from the \u201c\nOne League and one Labor\n\u201d of land that the Republic of Texas granted to Maria Francisca Sosa in 1838, according to the General Land Office.\nDullnig billed the raw land as a\ndevelopment opportunity\n, ready for \u201cimprovements of your choice,\u201d the listing states. The property includes several buildable homesites, according to Dullnig.\nThe sellers have leased the property as a\nhunting destination\nfor years. The perimeter of the land includes over seven miles of high fence, and five irrigation wells supply water to troughs and tanks, supplementing the Leona River.\nThe land has just over two miles of waterfront on the Leona. It\u2019s also veined by seasonal creeks that add over seven miles of waterfront during high-water periods.\nEugene Kincaid Jr. bought the land in 1948 for $121,000, according to public records. He was the grandson of William Davis Kincaid, who founded the Kincaid Ranch near Uvalde, just northeast of the Leona River ranch.\nEugene Kincaid III counted among his ancestors a veteran of the Battle of San Jacinto, which won the independence of the Republic of Texas. He collaborated with a professional historian in identifying a historic Spanish explorer campsite on the Kincaid Ranch.\n",

        "content": "New York\u2019s CityFHEPS voucher program has a $1.2 billion price tag. Now, the state comptroller wants less of that money going to \u201cbad\u201d landlords.\nIn an audit of the program released Friday, the comptroller\u2019s office found that the city approved units with infestations and other serious concerns for participation in the program. And some tenants have used their vouchers to pay landlords on the city\u2019s \u201cWorst Landlords\u201d list.\nAs such, the comptroller recommended that the program establish a \u201clandlord disqualification\u201d list.\nThe audit is the latest public criticism of the rental assistance program, which serves mostly formerly homeless New Yorkers, and is a source of income to private landlords. Disqualifying specific landlords from the program would cut them off from that income stream.\nThe state comptroller\u2019s office reviewed 45 CityFHEPS cases in the five boroughs. Of those, three had open housing code violations classified as \u201cimmediately hazardous,\u201d including infestations.\nThat\u2019s not only not a great situation for tenants, it\u2019s expensive, the report argued. For audited voucher recipients who ultimately had to move, the program had to pay nearly $119,000 in new brokers\u2019 fees and landlord incentives.\nIn one case, the city\u2019s Department of Social Services approved a tenant to move into a unit with 20 open violations, including mouse and cockroach infestations. DSS paid more than $7,000 to the broker and the landlord to secure the apartment before the tenant moved in. Another CityFHEPS tenant had already been approved to move out of that unit because of similar concerns.\n\u201cLandlords continue to participate in CityFHEPS without having to rectify poor living situations,\u201d the report said.\nFurther review by the comptroller\u2019s office found DSS also approved at least 57 CityFHEPS households to use their vouchers on units owned by landlords on the public advocate\u2019s \u201cWorst Landlords\u201d list.\nDSS said it would establish a landlord \u201cescalation\u201d list, \u201cto enable more intensive reviews of specific landlords.\u201d DSS disputed several of the report\u2019s conclusions, saying it contained several inaccuracies and doesn\u2019t highlight the successes of the program.\nIn a statement to\nGothamist\n, DSS accountability chief Bedros Boodanian blamed the habitability issues on New York\u2019s low vacancy rate.\n\u201cTenants, especially low-income households with vouchers like CityFHEPS, have very few available units from which to choose,\u201d Boodanian wrote. \u201cRestricting voucher use to only pristine landlords would shrink an already microscopic pool of available units, further delaying housing for people who need it most.\u201d\nTo the comptroller\u2019s office, DSS said The \u201cWorst Landlords\u201d list lacks legal enforceability.\nThe audit identified other concerns with CityFHEPS oversight. For example, in thirty out of 75 statewide cases, there was no record of income verification. The comptroller\u2019s office recommended that DSS follow its income verification policies.\n",

It is not clear whether the firm plans to occupy both 1800 Owens and 455 Mission Bay or is deciding between the two locations.\nThe 1800 Owens complex totals approximately 750,000 square feet and is located about half a mile from OpenAI\u2019s existing offices in Mission Bay. Dropbox at one point occupied the entire building but began\nparing down its footprint\nduring the pandemic,\nsubleasing out much of the space\n.\nThe creator of ChatGPT has been on a growth spurt in Mission Bay since 2023, beginning that year with a nearly 500,000-square-foot\nsublease from Uber\nacross two buildings on Third Street and continuing the following year with a full-building lease encompassing 315,000 square feet at 550 Terry A. Francois Boulevard. The latter deal marked one of the largest office deals in San Francisco in 2024.\nThough OpenAI\u2019s operations are concentrated in San Francisco, the ChatGPT giant is looking to grow into Silicon Valley.

The\nSpurs\nwould front the purchase price under a funding framework the council\napproved\nlast August as part of its broader partnership with the NBA franchise.\nThe office building, controlled by the General Services Administration, was deemed surplus and placed on the GSA\u2019s accelerated disposition list last year. Council is set to vote on the acquisition Jan. 15, following a recommendation from the Planning Commission in December. City officials estimate the federal review process would take 90 to 120 days once an offer is submitted.\nWhile the city would own the properties, the federal government is expected to remain in the office building for up to five years under a leaseback arrangement. Officials say the rental income would cover operating costs during that period. Any future redevelopment of the building would also be constrained by restrictive covenants from the Texas Historical Commission, adding a layer of complexity to long-term plans, according to the publication.\nStill, city staff have framed the acquisition as foundational to Project Marvel\u2019s ambitions. In a memo to the Planning Commission, officials said federal control of the parcels has long acted as a \u201csignificant buffer\u201d between Hemisfair and surrounding streets, limiting pedestrian and vehicular access and contributing to underinvestment in nearby Tower Park.\nBringing the land under local control would allow the city to rework entrances, improve wayfinding and better integrate Hemisfair into the surrounding urban fabric, while opening the door to\nuses more consistent\nwith a dense, mixed-use entertainment district anchored by a new arena, according to city documents.\nMomentum for the broader plan picked up in November, when Bexar County voters approved $311 million in\npublic funding\nfor Hemisfair-area development.\nProject Marvel\u2019s broader scope along with a new arena includes expansion of the Henry B. Gonz\u00e1lez Convention Center, a 1,000-room hotel, a 5,000-seat venue and about 50 acres of mixed-use development. The city already approved a Project Finance Zone, allowing it to collect up to $2 billion in hotel taxes over 30 years. The city is also expected to chip in $490 million, and the Spurs organization committed to $1 billion toward the district.\nThe city\u2019s interest in the site has been public for months. Last year, City Manager Erik Walsh described the building as a priority acquisition, and former Hemisfair CEO Andres Andujar also flagged the property as critical to making Project Marvel succeed.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Despite efforts by Mayor Zohran Mamdani\u2019s administration, Summit Properties is slated to take over more than 5,000 mostly rent-stabilized New York apartments from Joel Wiener\u2019s Pinnacle Group. The final auction price was not immediately clear after the firm issued an initial bid of $451 million.\nIt\u2019s the result of Pinnacle\u2019s bankruptcy auction, in which Summit represented the minimum, or stalking horse, bidder. A confirmation hearing is scheduled for January 15.\nThe auction commenced despite efforts by tenants and elected officials, most recently Mamdani\u2019s office, to delay the sale. The coalition had asked the judge in the case for more time, originally hoping that the city or a nonprofit might be able to draft a workable bid. After Summit came forward as a stalking horse bidder, the city asked for a 30-day pause to evaluate the sale to Summit and explore potential alternatives.\nHowever, the judge rejected that effort in a Wednesday hearing, clearing the way for Summit\u2019s acquisition.\nAs distress grows in the city\u2019s rent-stabilized housing stock, the auction result shows a potential future for thousands of units across the city. Surging expenses and elevated interest rates have eaten away at revenue, at the same time that a 2019 statewide law has limited owners\u2019 abilities to raise rents. Pinnacle placed its LLCs into Chapter 11 bankruptcy owing $564 million to Flagstar Bank, according to court records.\n\u201cWe are deeply committed to New York and understand how critical the preservation of affordable housing is to the success of our City,\u201d Zohar Levy, chairman of Summit, said in a statement. \u201cWe have reached out to the City and look forward to talking with the new administration and residents about our plans to invest in the portfolio and help make New York affordable for everyone.\u201d\nSummit has a national portfolio of regional malls, office buildings and New York City apartments. But the Mamdani administration expressed concern that Summit wouldn\u2019t be able to make the acquisition work while repairing the properties and maintaining rent stabilization. The bankrupt LLCs owe the city more than $12.7 million in unpaid fees and violations, which number more than 5,000.\nThe legal rents on the units are low enough that Summit likely couldn\u2019t maintain an income stream to profitably support renovations and debt service, the city said in a court filing.\nEastdil Secured advised on the auction.",

        "content": "Billionaires are leaving California in droves in the face of a ballot initiative seeking to place a 5 percent tax on their wealth.\nAt least six dozen billionaires\nleft the Golden State\nbefore the new year and more than a dozen others could follow suit, Bloomberg reported, citing financial advisers working for the affluent. If approved by voters this November, any billionaire living in the state as of Jan. 1, 2026 would be eligible for the one-time 5 percent tax on fortunes exceeding $1 billion.\nOn Dec. 31,\nPeter Thiel\nand\nDavid Sacks\nboth publicly announced new office locations in Florida and Texas, respectively, following the relocation of four other billionaires ahead of the new year. Financial adviser David Lesperance told Bloomberg that he helped four billionaires leave the state ahead of the Jan. 1 residency cut-off date;\nIconiq Capital\nfounder Divesh Makan knows a handful of other families that have already departed and expects another 15 to 20 to flee if the tax is approved, Makan told Bloomberg.\nThe billionaire tax initiative still has a ways to go before making it to the\nNovember ballot\n. The effort must gather hundreds of thousands of signatures to qualify for the ballot, then secure approval from a majority of California voters. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is among those who have spoken out against the bill.\nTech founders from major companies like Netflix, WhatsApp and Stripe are\nreportedly also looking\nat homes in Florida to escape California, the New York Post reported. Last month, Google co-founder Larry Page\nbought roughly\n$173 million of waterfront real estate in Miami, including one $100 million estate and another one nearby for $72 million, per the Wall Street Journal.\n\u201cIn the last probably month or so, I\u2019ve had multiple billionaires from California come to see several different listings that I have,\u201d Devin Kay, a Miami-based agent with Douglas Elliman, told the Post. \u201cSo there\u2019s definitely a huge wave of them, it appears they are either\nbuying properties in Miami\nor in the market to buy properties, and will once they find something here shortly.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been seeing a huge influx from California ever since Covid,\u201d Kay added. \u201cIn the last three or four years, I\u2019ve seen more buyers from California than I ever have in my entire career. But I would say the megabillionaires or the very, very wealthy people from California \u2014 that is definitely more recent as of the last, maybe two or three months.\u201d\nSimply put, these ultra-wealthy buyers are looking to escape the possible ballot measure in California. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty obvious why these guys are doing what they\u2019re doing in Miami,\u201d Kay said.\nBut billionaires aren\u2019t the only ones leaving California, and this trend isn\u2019t new among the average person.\nOf the more than 2.5 million one-way trips using\nU-Haul\nvehicles last year, the difference between number of people leaving and the number of people arriving\nwas higher in California\nthan in any other state, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing data from U-Haul. The Golden state has had the biggest net outflow for six years in a row. Of California U-Haulers, 50.6 percent of the moving company\u2019s one-way customers left, while 49.4 percent arrived.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "On Thursday afternoon, a group of tenants gathered at the corner of West 55th Street and Sixth Avenue.\n\u201cDon\u2019t let our homes be sold to another slumlord!\u201d they said.\nJust a few blocks away, a very different gathering was taking place: an auction for those same homes.\nAt the law offices of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, bids were circulating for more than 5,000 mostly rent-stabilized apartments. They are the property of Joel Wiener\u2019s Pinnacle Group, which had put them into bankruptcy.\nWe\u2019ve heard the auction started Thursday morning and went into the night. But the winner was confirmed at 4 p.m. on Friday: Summit Properties, run by chairman Zohar Levy, is\nslated to be the new owner\nof the units.\nIt\u2019s a deal that\u2019s been much scrutinized. The city has raised concerns about the profitability of the minimum bid and sought to delay the auction. Tenants obviously consider Summit to be a slumlord. On Wednesday, reporting from Bisnow\nrevealed\nconnections between Summit and Wiener\u2019s brother Jonathan Wiener.\nBut beyond the back and forth about the sale price and Summit\u2019s stewardship, the pushback is, in my estimation, really about tenants and the Mamdani administration sensing an opportunity to take these units outside the purview of a traditional private landlord and into something\u2026 else.\nWhat that something else is, well, they haven\u2019t quite worked that out. The words \u201ccooperative,\u201d \u201cpreservation\u201d and \u201ccommunity land trust\u201d have been bandied around. I\u2019ve written before about the\nvery real and bold dreams of alternative ownership\nfrom advocates and city officials. But so far there\u2019s no clear vision of what tenants and Mamdani want for these units.\nWhat is clear is that they have a limited time to get it. A delay would have given them time to think and plan, but that effort was\nthrown out by the bankruptcy judge\n. Summit now all but holds the keys. There\u2019s a hearing scheduled to confirm the auction result on January 15, giving the city just days to throw around its weight.\nIt\u2019s not looking so good right now for the city, but what could happen next is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have so many examples that sort of show us what\u2019s possible here,\u201d Ariel Hirsch of the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board told me at the rally.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWho is buying rent-stabilized buildings? Since the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 gutted the ability of landlords to raise those rents, it\u2019s been said that rent-stabilized buildings are worth next to nothing. But clearly, someone is willing to pay for them. We\u2019ve already profiled Peter Hungerford. This auction will give us another name. We\u2019re hearing it\u2019s a lot of local long-term landlords who plan to stay in the business. Got info about the folks getting into the rent-stabilized game as everyone is getting out? Email\nlilah.burke@therealdeal.com\n.\nElsewhere:\n\u2014 Mamdani has\nendorsed\nClaire Valdez, a 36-year-old state Assembly member from Queens, in the race to represent New York\u2019s seventh district in Congress. The district is prime \u201cCommie Corridor\u201d territory, incorporating parts of Bushwick, Ridgewood, Clinton Hill, Williamsburg, Greenpoint and the mayor\u2019s own Astoria. Valdez is a fellow member of the Democratic Socialists of America. The seat was previously occupied by Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez and is also being pursued by Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso.\n\u2014 More red light cameras are heading to New York City streets,\nwrites\nGothamist. The Department of Transportation has a goal of 600 cameras by the end of the year, up from 150.\nA thing we learned:\nA growing number of Americans are getting their mortgages from places that aren\u2019t banks. That number is now 64 percent, up from 42 percent in 2014.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$14 million\nfor 53 West 53rd Street, 59B. The Midtown Central condo is 3,200 square feet. The property was last sold as a new development in 2020 for $12.8 million.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$15.2 million\nfor 4275 Boston Road. The Eastchester industrial building is 72,248 square feet. UPS acquired the property from Excelsior Investors, who purchased the site five years ago for $8.1 million.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $11.9 million for 50 Bridge Park Drive, Unit 26A. The Brooklyn Heights condo is 4,500 square feet.\nCompass\u2019\nLindsay Barrett, Taylor Schultz and Christopher Mohr are the listing agents.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

Construction was expected to start in early 2024 and take two years.\nAn affiliate of Miami-based Hyperion and New York-based Winter paid $12 million for the 3.7-acre development site at 114-222 North Federal Highway in 2021. Washington Real Estate Partners was the seller.\nThe increased subsidy is less than what Hyperion requested. The developer asked the CRA last year to raise the incentive to $16 million and stretch the deal to 15 years, citing a shifting economic landscape since the agreement was inked in May 2024.\nThe site is just north of Boynton Beach\u2019s downtown core. Arquitectonica is designing the development.\nCRAs can deploy taxpayer dollars to spur investment in redevelopment zones, often using TIF agreements to rebate a portion of future property tax revenue generated by developments.\nHyperion pointed to rising construction costs, persistent inflation, elevated interest rates, higher insurance premiums and uncertainty around tariffs, all of which it said had eroded the project\u2019s feasibility, in its request for additional subsidies.\nAn independent analysis commissioned by the CRA and conducted by Washington, D.C.-based Abramson &amp; Associates largely backed that assessment, finding Hyperion\u2019s revised cost projections \u201creasonable\u201d and concurring that broader economic conditions had worsened since the earlier agreement.\nCity officials previously described the $9 million incentive as the largest TIF package in the CRA\u2019s history.\nThe property sits within Boynton Beach\u2019s 2.6-square-mile redevelopment area, which has drawn interest as developers look for relatively cheap land between\nBoca Raton\nand\nWest Palm Beach\n.\n\u2014Rachel Stone",

        "content": "Developer BGI Capital completed a $40.9 million acquisition of a development site adjacent to its nearly completed waterfront West Palm Beach condo tower, Alba Palm Beach.\nRecords show the Miami-based developer, led by Kenneth Baboun and Robert Barthelmess, bought the properties at 4720, 4802 and 4804 North Flagler Drive from Justo Naranjo, Beatriz Corrales, and Nataly Nicole Corrales for $33 million.\nThe purchase includes a waterfront single-family home and the 11 remaining units in the 4800 North Dixie condominium complex. That\u2019s in addition to the five units BGI bought for $7.9 million in 2023, according to property records.\nThe property is adjacent to BGI\u2019s\nAlba Palm Beach\n, a 22-story, 55-unit condominium set for completion this spring. Alba is 70 percent pre-sold, Baboun confirmed. BGI financed the purchase with a $25.6 million loan from a Linkvest Capital affiliate, according to property records.\nThe sites total 2.2 acres and 200 feet of waterfront, Baboun confirmed.\nThe developer is in the approval process for a second condo project tentatively dubbed Alba Reserve and slated for 31 stories and 87 units, according to city planning documents. BGI tapped Carlos Ott and Spina O\u2019Rourke + Partners as the architects for the project. The tower will rise 360 feet, and units will be larger than in the adjacent Alba project, with square footage starting at 3,000 square feet, he confirmed. Baboun is also\nconsidering branding the project\n.\n\u201cIt\u2019s early to know what it\u2019s going to be,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m in concept design, this is the exciting part.\u201d\nWhile the project is in early stages, Baboun made clear he is going for a luxe client with a bigger budget than his first West Palm Beach tower, where prices started at $2.5 million.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going high end all the way,\u201d he said, noting the strength of the market over $6 million.\nNaranjo is a local resident and real estate investor with a portfolio of properties throughout Palm Beach County, records show. He and his wife Beatriz Corrales bought the single-family home at 4720 North Flagler Drive for $1.7 million in 2014 and have it homesteaded.\nAfter the developer acquired the 1.7-acre Alba site for $5.8 million in 2020, Naranjo and his family members started acquiring units in the neighboring condo buildings, anticipating future developer interest. Records show they spent about $2 million buying the units.\nThe two planned towers are part of\na deep pipeline of condo projects\nin West Palm Beach that total more than 2,000 units. The rapid market growth has raised speculation about possible saturation, but Baboun said he sees \u201cdepth\u201d in the market.\n\u201cWe\u2019re conservative with our pipeline, we\u2019re in no hurry to launch projects as we speak,\u201d he said, adding that sales will not launch for this second tower for another year or two.\nBaboun said he sees a severe shortage of existing waterfront condos in the city.\nOther developers see it, too. Huizenga Holdings and Integra Investments are planning a $2 billion redevelopment of the waterfront around Rybovich Marina at 4200 North Flagler Drive that will include four towers with more than 660 residential units. Toronto-based Great Gulf is planning a 32-story, 97-unit tower at 5400 North Flagler Drive, a site it bought for\n$28.5 million\nin 2024.",

        "content": "Gov. Gavin Newsom\nis taking aim at institutional investors making purchases in the residential market.\nFollowing a\nsimilar announcement by President Donald Trump\n, Newsom is\nplanning to work\nwith local legislators to prevent private equity and hedge fund investors and other corporate entities from purchasing homes in California, the Mercury News reported, citing communications with the governor\u2019s office.\n\u201cThe fact is that large investors are purchasing homes faster than families can buy them,\u201d the governor\u2019s office said. \u201cThe governor believes that working families shouldn\u2019t be competing with large, well-capitalized investors.\u201d\nNewsom shared his approach in his State of the State address on Thursday.\n\u201cThere is another urgent area requiring our attention. That\u2019s institutional investors snatching up homes by the hundreds and thousands at a time, crushing the dream of home ownership, and forcing rents too damn high for everyone else. It\u2019s shameful that we allow private equity firms in Manhattan to become the biggest landlords in many of our cities,\u201d Newsom said.\n\u201cOver the next few weeks, we will work with the Legislature to combat this monopolistic behavior, strengthen accountability, and level the playing field for working families. That means more oversight and enforcement, and potentially changing the state tax code to make this work,\u201d he said.\nAbout 3 percent of single-family homes in California are owned by large landlords; publicly traded\nInvitation Homes\nis the largest owner, according to a 2024 study by the California Research Bureau cited by the Mercury News. Large\ninstitutional landlords\nown less than 1 percent of total U.S. single-family housing inventory, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company analysts said in a statement this week, per the Mercury News.\nAfter Trump announced his intentions to take on institutional investors in residential real estate, stock share prices of single-family landlords fell by as much as 10 percent, according to the Mercury News. \u201cAt the risk of whistling past the graveyard, we could argue that the dip in the stocks presents a buying opportunity,\u201d JPMorgan analysts said in their report.\nNewsom\u2019s announcement is already being well received in the state legislature. Last year, the state assembly approved a bill that would ban large single-family residential property owners from buying and leasing more homes. The measure ended up stalling in the state Senate amid opposition from real estate agents and the California Apartment Association.\n\u201cHaving the governor\u2019s backing and support is going to be crucial and very helpful,\u201d Assemblymember Alex Lee, who authored that bill, said, vowing to pursue it again this year. Newsom has not endorsed a specific proposal.\nState Senator Scott Wiener also supports legislation targeting corporate landlords but shies away from policies that could choke housing production. \u201cThere\u2019s been a desire to do something about the gobbling up of single-family homes by institutional investors for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is an issue that we need to deal with.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A Chicago developer is testing the city\u2019s appetite for new housing in the South Loop, proposing a 19-story apartment building.\nA venture led by Vahooman Mirkhaef filed a zoning application to build a 237-unit residential building at 557\u2013571 West Polk Street. The proposal would replace a two-story office building that currently serves as the headquarters of Environmental Group Services, Mirkhaef\u2019s environmental consulting firm, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nDetails on construction costs and timing were not disclosed, but the plan would add to a\nsparse downtown\npipeline. Financing challenges over the past few years have sidelined many large projects, even as rents have rebounded sharply.\nJust three large-scale apartment developments totaling fewer than 600 units are slated to be completed downtown in 2026, according to Integra Realty Resources. That shortage has helped push rents up more than 8 percent, year over year, in the third quarter of 2025, the firm said.\nSome new building permits for apartments near the city\u2019s core are starting to take shape, however. Across the water in River North, a full building permit was issued last week for\nZSD\u2019s\nmixed-use development at 310 West Huron Street, paving the way for construction to begin on a 149-unit residential project with ground-floor retail. The site, which stretches along Huron Street from Franklin Street to Orleans Street, is currently occupied by a parking lot.\nMirkhaef\u2019s venture has owned the Polk Street property since 2003, according to the zoning filing. The original purchase price does not appear in Cook County property records. Mirkhaef did not respond to requests for comment from the publication.\nThe proposal includes 102 off-street parking spaces and would fall under Chicago\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance.\nPlans\ncall for 12 affordable units to be built on site and another 12 elsewhere in the 28th Ward, with an in-lieu fee covering the remaining obligation.\nMirkhaef is also a controversial figure in local real estate and business circles. He previously operated Cub Terminal, a\nsuburban logistics depot\n, and in 2021 pleaded guilty to paying bribes to former state\nSen. Martin Sandoval\nto aid that business, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. In 2024, federal prosecutors declined to oppose his appeal to overturn the conviction.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "One of Rogers Park\u2019s most recognizable homes is heading to national television, and possibly a six-figure renovation.\nThe Candyland House, the pastel-drenched Victorian at 1525 West Pratt Boulevard in Chicago, is featured this season on HGTV\u2019s \u201cUgliest House in America,\u201d giving the property a shot at a $150,000 makeover. The home appears in the show\u2019s seventh season, which premiered this week, Block Club Chicago\nreported\n.\nOwners Joe Bergantino and Ricky Gonzalez said HGTV reached out in late 2024 about a potential appearance, without initially disclosing the show. When they learned the\nCandyland House\nwas being considered for \u201cUgliest House in America,\u201d the couple took it in stride. Gonzalez told the outlet that they started laughing.\nThe show, hosted by comedian\nRetta\n, tours some of the country\u2019s most over-the-top fixer-uppers before selecting one for a full renovation led by \u201cSin City Rehab\u201d designer\nAlison Victoria\n. The winning home gets a fast-tracked overhaul that would otherwise take years for most owners to tackle.\nIn 2022. Bergantino and Gonzalez bought the house built in 1891 and have been slowly restoring it while documenting the process on Instagram. Longtime\nRogers Park\nresidents know the home for its candy-colored exterior and wildly imaginative interiors, a legacy of artists Jackie Seiden and the late Don Seiden, who coated nearly every surface in pastel hues, sometimes accented with glitter.\nWhen the Seiden family sold the house in 2021, neighbors worried the next owners might strip away its personality. Bergantino and Gonzalez promised to preserve the home\u2019s\neccentric spirit\n, and say that won\u2019t change even if HGTV selects it for the renovation.\n\u201cNo chance in hell would the renovation ever be black, white, gray or beige,\u201d Bergantino told the publication.\nFilming took place in June, with a 12-hour shoot expected to be edited down to a brief segment. The couple paused their own renovation work once they learned they\u2019d be featured, figuring an untouched interior might improve their odds of winning the makeover.\nWithout the\nHGTV\nboost, they estimate it would take roughly a decade to complete their plans. If selected, the transformation would take about six weeks \u2014 a dramatic shift in both timeline and cost.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The project, deemed Sutro Cove, would rise on a site owned by longtime residents that live in two homes on nine lots, which firm founder Stanley Saitowitz said his team plans to subdivide into 20 units.\n\u201cThe property actually belongs to a family that grew up there,\u201d Saitowitz told SF Gate. \u201cWe\u2019ve done quite a few buildings around the city that present this\u2026 modern interpretation of the traditional texture of the city, and that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the design.\u201d\nThe buildings would feature floor-to-ceiling windows and inset balconies facing the Pacific Ocean. Units would feature repeating bay windows that Saitowitz said would create a \u201cwaving facade\u201d mimicking the ocean waves below. Residences at Sutro Cove would range from studios to four-bedroom units. Two of the apartments in the building would be set aside as deed-restricted\naffordable housing\nfor\nresidents making 80 percent\nof the area\u2019s median income \u2014 $87,300 for one person or $124,700 for a household of four. The firm has applied to use\nSenate Bill 423\n, which streamlines approval for affordable and mixed-income housing.\nThe development would also have garage parking for 18 vehicles and internal courtyards to help block winds coming off the ocean \u2014 a common architectural touch in many Sunset and\nRichmond District\nhomes.\nSaitowitz\u2019s firm has left its mark across San Francisco with notable projects such as the Beth Sholom Synagogue in the Inner Richmond. Sutro Cove\u2019s design is inspired by the recently completed \u201cHouse of Fog\u201d at 2117 46th Avenue in the\nSunset District\n, which Stanley Saitowitz | Natoma Architects designed. That two-unit property is centered around a central courtyard and served as \u201ca prototype for the thinking around these houses,\u201d Saitowitz said.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "One of Downtown Dallas\u2019 marquee redeveloped towers is heading to the lender.\nThe National, a 52-story mixed-use skyscraper carved out of the former First National Bank Tower, will be foreclosed on and taken over by Starwood Capital Group next month, owner Shawn Todd of Todd Interests\ntold\nthe Dallas Morning News. Starwood is expected to file the foreclosure Friday, ending Todd Interests\u2019 run at the property.\nTodd\nsaid his firm owes roughly $230 million on the building and won\u2019t contest the action. The decision, he said, comes down to math that no longer works: elevated interest rates, soft downtown values and apartment occupancy that has slipped below 80 percent.\n\u201cWith our debt balance, the interest rate environment and property values downtown, we don\u2019t see a path to us recouping our remaining equity,\u201d Todd told the publication, adding that negotiations with\nStarwood\nwere cordial. \u201cIn 35 years, our firm has never lost money \u2014 this is the first year that it\u2019s happened.\u201d\nDallas-based Todd Interests and partners poured about $460 million into transforming the long-vacant, 1.5 million-square-foot tower at 1401 Elm Street. Opened in 1965 and shuttered in 2010 as office demand collapsed, the building sat empty for a decade before becoming one of the largest urban restoration projects in the country and the biggest in\nDallas\nhistory.\nThe redevelopment converted the mid-century office monolith into a blend of apartments, hotel rooms, offices and retail, backed by heavy public incentives. Todd once billed the financing as the largest historic tax credit deal in\nTexas\n, anchored by roughly $100 million in historic credits and $50 million in city tax increment financing.\nTodd told the outlet that more than $150 million has already been repaid to tax credit investors, including Stonehenge Capital and AHP, Warren Buffett\u2019s tax-credit arm. The project was refinanced with Starwood three years ago, a deal that allowed Todd and major investor Moriah Real Estate to recoup about 90 percent of their investment. Much of that capital was plowed back into the building in hopes a rebound would follow.\nIt didn\u2019t. \u201cThe values aren\u2019t there,\u201d Todd said. \u201cThe loan is due, and we\u2019re not going to continue to pay.\u201d\nThe foreclosure comes shortly after Todd Interests sold its stake in the nearby East Quarter redevelopment to J.P. Morgan Asset Management.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "With the Compass and Anywhere Real Estate\u2019s mega-merger closed months ahead of schedule, the residential industry is now in the wait-and-see phase for the ripple effects from the seismic deal.\nThe earliest symptom so far is New York City\u2019s publicists, agents and executives tapping the acquisition as a hook to explain their next moves.\nEarlier this week, the companies announced that the proposed acquisition, valued at $1.6 billion, had\ncleared the waiting period\nfor antitrust regulatory review and would likely close by Friday, even though the firms initially said the deal likely wouldn\u2019t be finalized until late 2026. Stockholders\nvoted to approve\nthe merger on Wednesday.\nThe next morning, an email from a publicist landed in my inbox, flagging the split of one of Compass\u2019 top teams in Bergen County, New Jersey, a move she billed as \u201cparticular notable given the timing of the $1.6 billion merger\u201d and her client, Max Stokes\u2019, status as a founding member of the brokerage\u2019s Ridgewood outpost.\n\u201cIf I was going to make a move, this would be the perfect time to do it,\u201d said Stokes, who isn\u2019t leaving Compass, but breaking from his partner Megan Fox to launch his own \u201csmall and mighty\u201d team. He called the merger an \u201cinflection point\u201d and said Compass growing bigger was a \u201cgreat thing\u201d even as he aims to shrink his operation.\nStill, some have cited the acquisition among the reasons for their departures from Compass. On Wednesday, just before news of the deal closing broke, a New York City and Westchester agent sent an email announcing her move to Brown Harris Stevens, and in it, she wrote that \u201cthe acquisition of Anywhere Brand along with the\nZillow Lawsuit\nnews took attention and resources away from agents.\u201d\nCompass and Anywhere announced their agreement to merge in September, sending shockwaves through the industry, still reeling from Compass\u2019 earlier\n$444 million acquisition\nof @properties and Christie\u2019s International Real Estate.\nThe proposed deal stipulated that Compass CEO Robert Reffkin would lead the merged companies and that brands would continue to operate independently. On Friday, Reffkin and executives with Anywhere\u2019s subsidiaries, including the Corcoran Group CEO Pam Liebman, presented a united front, posting a graphic with all of the brands\u2019 logos with the tagline \u201cBetter Together\u201d on social media.\nThe news raised questions about how the well-known names would operate under one roof and whether agents in Anywhere\u2019s network would remain with their firms under the Compass umbrella. Since then, many independent brokerages, especially in New York City, have\ntouted the deal\nas a boon for their businesses.\n\u201cBigger isn\u2019t always better,\u201d Brown Harris Stevens CEO Bess Freedman told\nThe Real Deal\nin September. \u201cNot everyone wants a big company.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s too soon to tell whether that pitch will pan out. In November, Zillow\npublished a report\nshowing that about half of Anywhere agents surveyed by the platform said they would consider leaving if the acquisition made it across the finish line.\nHowever, on further inspection, the results weren\u2019t particularly revelatory \u2014 they included responses from just 122 brokers in Anywhere\u2019s 300,000-agent network, according to a Zillow spokesperson, who also said he didn\u2019t have the breakdown of which firms the agents responding belonged to.\nThe data we do have shows the ebb and flow of top producers among legacy firms is alive and well. including one of Douglas Elliman\u2019s leading Brooklyn brokers, Lindsay Barton Barrett, who on Tuesday\nbrought her team\nto the brokerage. Last month, Heather Domi, a New York City and South Florida agent and co-founder of the New York Residential Agent Continuum,\nleft Compass\nto join Elliman.\nNot so fast\u2026\nNew York City\u2019s new development market logged a\nlackluster year\nin 2025.\nBuyers signed contracts for 2,750 new development properties across Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, down 11 percent from the total in 2024, Marketproof data shows. The firm\u2019s CEO Kael Goodman chalked the dip up to inventory, especially in Manhattan and Brooklyn, failing to keep pace with demand \u2014 an issue several new development players\nexpect to continue\nplaguing the market in 2026.\nLast year, Manhattan nabbed 1,400 inked deals last year, marking a 12 percent annual decrease, while inventory in the borough fell 13 percent year-over-year. In Brooklyn, contract signings dropped 6 percent to roughly 1,000, while inventory declined 19 percent.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe most expensive sale to hit the city rolls this week was for a townhouse at 22 East 78th Street, which closed for roughly $10.5 million. The five-story home, which sold to an anonymous LLC with an address in Washington D.C., last traded in 2015 for $12.6 million.\nThe townhouse spans 5,500 square feet and has five bedrooms and six bathrooms. It also features a terrace, landscaped garden, chef\u2019s kitchen and five fireplaces.\nCompass\u2019 Oliver Han had the listing.\n",

        "content": "To start the year, Marc Holliday\u2019s SL Green is straddling two very different realities in Manhattan\u2019s office market. The contrast is hard to miss.\nOn one side is\n100 Park Avenue\n, where the real estate investment trust looks firmly in control. Selling a minority stake in the building to Rockpoint at a $425 million valuation gave SL Green a clean, early win as it kicks off a planned $2.5 billion selloff.\nThe move came just weeks after the firm bought out Prudential\u2019s 49 percent stake at a $360 million valuation, put in fresh equity and quickly turned around and sold an interest at a higher mark.\nThat kind of sequencing sends a message: this isn\u2019t a fire sale. The 900,000-square-foot tower is 95 percent leased, buoyed by Alvarez &amp; Marsal\u2019s 220,000-square-foot deal, and sits just south of Grand Central; it\u2019s exactly the kind of asset that\u2019s still drawing capital.\nBy selling partial interests instead of whole buildings, SL Green is freeing up cash to deal with high interest rates while keeping a hand on the wheel. Management has framed the selloff as balance-sheet management, not a pullback, and has already said it plans to be back buying this year.\nAcross Midtown, though, the tone is much more combative. At Worldwide Plaza, SL Green and RXR are fighting in court to\nblock a UCC foreclosure\nthey say is designed to wrest control of the property rather than recover mezzanine debt. The lawsuit against Extell Development paints the auction as rushed, restrictive and tilted to scare off real bidders.\nIt\u2019s a high-stakes fight over who gets leverage in restructuring nearly $1 billion of CMBS debt.\nThe backdrop is ugly. Worldwide Plaza is only about 63 percent occupied, lost Cravath as its anchor tenant and was appraised at $345 million last year, down sharply from its pre-pandemic peak.\nTogether, the properties show SL Green playing both sides of the cycle: cashing in where demand and liquidity still exist and digging in where the path forward depends less on leasing wins and more on control, timing and the courts.\nThere\u2019s been no shortage of New York real estate headlines in the early days of 2026. Here\u2019s some of the week\u2019s other big stories.\nJudge rejects Mamdani\u2019s bid to pause Pinnacle auction, paves way for Summit takeover\nIn the first big test of Zohran Mamdani\u2019s real estate policy plans, a bankruptcy judge rejected the city\u2019s bid to pause the auction of over 5,000 rent-stabilized apartments. The decision allows Summit Properties to proceed with a possible takeover of Joel Wiener\u2019s Pinnacle Group portfolio, though results of Thursday\u2019s auction still weren\u2019t public by the time of this writing.\n\u201cBroken promises\u201d and unpaid bills: Law firm representing Chetrit seeks to withdraw from case\nAttorney Elliott Joffe accused the Chetrits of non-cooperation, providing unreliable info and unpaid legal bills and is seeking to withdraw from representing Meyer Chetrit. The developer is battling a $132 million judgement owed to an entity of Maverick Real Estate Partners after a foreclosure case, as well as criminal charges of tenant harassment.\nJudge awards $22M to JLL over Moshe Silber\u2019s mortgage fraud\nMoshe Silber and his business partner, Fred Schulman, were ordered to pay $21.7 million in restitution to their lender, JLL. The pair pleaded guilty more than a year ago to a\nmortgage fraud scheme\nin which they obtained an inflated loan for a 976-unit rental property in Cincinnati.\nHousing whirlwind: Mamdani wastes no time targeting \u201cbad landlords\u201d\nMamdani began his term targeting \u201cbad landlords,\u201d including naming tenant advocate Cea Weaver as director of the relaunched Office to Protect Tenants. The city is also hosting \u201cRental Ripoff\u201d hearings for tenants to voice grievances and help shape future policy\n",

        "content": "So many crazy things are happening in real estate and politics. President Donald Trump and Gov. Kathy Hochul are adopting each other\u2019s ideas. Mayor Zohran Mamdani made a striking admission about rent-stabilized buildings. And Cea Weaver, tenant activist and newly appointed Mamdani official, is apologizing for her long-held beliefs.\nLet\u2019s start with Mamdani. His legal brief on the\nPinnacle portfolio bankruptcy\nasserted that even at the mere $88,000 per unit offered by Summit Properties USA, the price would be too high.\nThis is the same man who claimed throughout his campaign that owners of rent-stabilized housing were profiting handsomely. Now Mamdani is now declaring that rent-stabilized housing has been rendered\nvirtually worthless\n.\nHe\u2019s also saying it\nshould\nbe nearly worthless so that owners cannot borrow against it, freeing up money for operating expenses and repairs rather than mortgage payments.\nCommenters on social media pounced. Some said the city\u2019s legal filing should be presented to the Supreme Court as evidence that rent stabilization is\na taking\nof private property \u2014 and thus unconstitutional.\nSummit\u2019s offer is actually higher than other rent-stabilized portfolios are asking. One industry PR veteran told me he can\u2019t wrap his brain around the fact that in New York City it costs $800,000 to build an affordable unit but\nonly $69,000\nto buy one.\n\u201cThe delta between the cost and value of the affordable units is striking,\u201d he emailed. \u201cI\u2019m no economist, but when a commodity is worth 1/10th of what it costs to produce, I think there is a problem.\u201d\nAlso striking: Tenant activist Weaver was forced to say her past tweets that private property should be seized and that homeownership is a tool of white supremacy were \u201c\nregretful\n\u201d and \u201cnot something I would say today.\u201d\nWeaver, 37, has been consistent in\nthese opinions\nfor years. Suddenly she finds them regretful? What she really regrets is having to walk them back. Swallowing your pride is the price of being inside City Hall rather than protesting on its steps.\nMaking Weaver apologize is another sign that Mamdani is\nmoving away from radicalism\nin order to govern. Meanwhile in Washington, Trump\u2019s aides seem to do the opposite \u2014 abandoning\nmainstream opinions\nthey\nonce held\nin favor of provocative statements to please the boss and the base.\nSpeaking of Trump, you know we\u2019re in strange times when he and Hochul are adopting each other\u2019s ideas. And not good ideas, either.\nTrump on Wednesday\ncalled for a ban\non institutional investors\u2019 buying single-family homes, something\nHochul did last year\n\u2014 with cowardly state legislators joining in.\nMy\ncolumn\nabout Hochul\u2019s proposal had a very subtle headline: \u201cWhy Hochul\u2019s crackdown on real estate investors makes absolutely no sense.\u201d\nInstitutional investors are a small fraction of the market and don\u2019t get into bidding wars for homes. They rent houses to people who can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to own. They own\nless than 1 percent\nof single-family homes and\n3 or 4 percent\nof single-family rentals. They account for\n0.5 percent\nto\n2 percent\nof single-family purchases. For\nsix consecutive quarters\nthey have sold more homes than they\u2019ve bought.\nTrump\u2019s bomb-drop on homebuying came just six days after Hochul proposed \u201c\nno tax on tips\n,\u201d matching a Trump campaign proposal that Congress put into the Big Beautiful Bill.\nOne is a real estate policy and the other is about taxes, but they are similar in that they aim to fool voters, not to be effective policy.\nTrump\u2019s \u201cno tax on tips\u201d sounds progressive because tipped workers are not high earners. But it applies to just 2 percent of workers. What about the other 98 percent? Why do restaurants\u2019 servers but not kitchen staff deserve a tax break?\nAbout 37 percent of tipped workers don\u2019t even make enough money to pay federal income taxes, so Trump\u2019s policy doesn\u2019t save them anything. But their tips are still subject to payroll taxes.\nHochul\u2019s tips proposal seems like a preemptive move to ensure that her Republican challenger, Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, cannot adopt it for his own campaign.\nIf the first week of 2026 is any indication, it\u2019s going to be a wild year.\n",

        "content": "This year has started off with bad news for Chicago commercial real estate, as a battle over botched lab space deals is underway.\nChicago-based\nPortal Innovations filed suit against Boston-based Beacon Capital Partners\n, a major office landlord accused of failing to meet funding commitments tied to several of Portal\u2019s shared lab space ventures, including sites in Fulton Market, Houston, Boston and Atlanta.\nThe dispute centers on missed capital calls that Portal says could leave it unable to meet obligations on leases it signed with Beacon\u2019s financial backing.\nBeacon\npushed back, saying the outstanding capital call was less than $1 million and that it has already sunk tens of millions into Portal-backed buildouts.\nTheir drama drags the life sciences real estate mess squarely into Chicago \u2014 a market that, until now, had largely sidestepped the turmoil hammering San Diego, Boston and the Bay Area.\nAnd it\u2019s not just Portal. The company\u2019s model of flexible, fully built lab space for early-stage biotech startups draws comparisons to\nWeWork\u2019s\nill-fated coworking empire. Shared lab space is a capital-intensive business, especially when tenants can\u2019t scale. Chicago already saw one version collapse when\nBioLabs was evicted\nfrom a Sterling Bay-owned Lincoln Park property last year. That 125,000-square-foot property is about to be sold to\nDallas-based Altera Fund Advisors\n, likely at a substantial discount from Sterling\u2019s $64 million mortgage debt. The buyer plans to convert it from lab-oriented into outpatient medical offices.\nMeanwhile, national cracks in the sector continue to spread. In San Diego,\nBank OZK this week sold off a $265 million loan note\non a life sciences project also built by Chicago-based Sterling Bay to Strategic Value Partners. But that\u2019s only part of OZK\u2019s exposure to San Diego\u2019s struggling new development market for labs.\nThe bank also holds a $915 million loan on a 1.6 million-square-foot waterfront life sciences and office campus built by\nIQHQ\n\u2014 a six-block life sciences and office project that remains largely vacant. By the estimate of\nRebel Cole\n, a finance professor who has been outspoken about the risk within Bank OZK\u2019s loan book, the project could be worth as little as $500 million, nearly half the debt balance, depending on market rent assumptions and lease-up prospects.\nOf course, the\nsole building Sterling Bay completed\nat its famously stalled megadevelopment\nLincoln Yards\n, a 285,000-square-foot lab structure, is also still fully vacant and served as a warning the life sciences slowdown would hit Chicago. Bank OZK also extended more than $50 million in debt for Sterling Bay to build that project, and it\u2019s now being shopped with pricing expectations to come in below the loan balance.\nIt\u2019s a stark\nreversal from 2021\n, when life sciences was the darling of institutional investors. More than $10 billion poured into the sector that year as investors chased lab space insulated from the pandemic\u2019s office headwinds.\nTaconic Partners\n, for one, plowed $2 billion into New York projects aiming to corner the sector. Now, the firm\u2019s plans are largely frozen.\nThe latest life sciences report by CBRE painted a sluggish picture: the sector\u2019s vacancy rose to more than 23 percent across the U.S., though the 0.8 percent increase marked the smallest since late 2022. There\u2019s little clarity on when absorption will return.\nOnce thought immune to remote work trends, life sciences real estate is proving just as vulnerable to overbuilding, interest rates and shifting capital flows as any other asset class. Now, Chicago is experiencing the fallout.\n",

        "content": "The safest kind of bet is one you already know the outcome of. It\u2019s the perfect kind of bet for a guy on the sidelines, like, for example, Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson.\nOn the same day telecoms giant\nAT&amp;T dropped its bomb\non Downtown Dallas via news of its plans to relocate to Plano, Johnson was\ntalking to\nthe New York Post about Zohran Mamdani\u2019s inauguration.\n\u201cWhat was already a trickle is going to turn into a flood of individuals and companies who have called New York home for a long time, moving to Dallas,\u201d he told the outlet.\nThat\u2019s some impressive reading of the tea leaves. One wonders what gave him the idea. Maybe the half-built campuses for the world\u2019s biggest banks rising in his backyard clued him in.\nIt\u2019s 2026. We\u2019re about 15 years into the rise of North Texas as a corporate relo destination \u2014 so many years into the trend that\nit\u2019s started dwindling\n.\nMeanwhile,\nthe urban core\nof the city that elected Johnson was dealt a catastrophic blow on Monday. AT&amp;T announced plans to build a new campus in Plano, leaving a 2 million-square-foot hole in Downtown Dallas\u2019 already struggling office market as soon as late 2028. Before the announcement, vacancy rates in the urban core were averaging 33 percent, according to Partners Real Estate.\nGov. Greg Abbott didn\u2019t name Johnson, but seemed to take aim at the mayor when discussing who should shoulder the blame for the catastrophic move: \u201cLocal leaders, it\u2019s their responsibility to ensure that homeless people are not endangering their citizens,\u201d Abbott\nsaid\nat a campaign event in Fort Worth.\nThe same day, the future of Neiman Marcus\u2019 downtown flagship store got murkier.\nSaks Global CEO Marc Metrick stepped down\nas rumors swirled about a potential upcoming bankruptcy filing.\nIn early 2025, Saks announced plans to close the landmark store at 1618 Main Street, then repeatedly delayed the move after pushback from city leaders, stating it would remain open beyond the 2025 holiday season as talks continued with the city on a potential reimagining of the nine-story historic property.\nA third grenade hit Downtown Dallas last week when Todd Interests\u2019 Shawn Todd\ntold\nthe Dallas Morning News he\u2019s handing back the keys to The National, the skyscraper he spent $460 million converting into a mixed-use project. Starwood Capital Group is foreclosing on the property after providing a $230 million refi loan in 2023.\nThe building at 1401 Elm Street is one of the largest office conversion projects in the country, a poster child for adaptive reuse as a method of breathing new life into crumbling downtown office districts. Todd secured $150 million in state and local incentives to complete the ambitious project, which opened in TK.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been committed to downtown,\u201d Todd said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been committed for 20 years. In 35 years, our firm has never lost money \u2014 this is the first year that it\u2019s happened.\u201d\nThe smartest syndicator in the room\nThe world of real estate syndication has a reputation. Operators are seen as unsophisticated and inexperienced, treating real estate investment like social media influencing.\nJon Venetos seemed different\n. The Lurin Capital founder came up in prestigious hedge funds before pivoting to real estate, but he ended up meeting the same fate as his peers in the space. Since the spring of 2025, he\u2019s faced a crush of default lawsuits, foreclosures and receivership appointments; he\u2019s also fighting allegations of fraud from lenders and former employees.\nNew year, same distress\nWhen it seems like there\u2019s nothing left for\nTides Equities\nto lose, the embattled syndicator gets hit with another foreclosure notice. This time, the firm owned by Sean Kia and Ryan Andrade could lose Tides at Highland Meadows, a 650-unit apartment complex at 11330 Amanda Lane in Dallas. The $76.4 million loan tied to the property is a chunk of the\n$826 million in troubled CRE debt\nthat were flagged for foreclosure auction this month, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service. The number represents a dip from\nDecember\u2019s high of $911 million\nin debt headed to auction, but it\u2019s still far above prior months when the value of debt flagged for foreclosure hovered around $600 million.\nRiver Oaks dominates in Houston\u2019s top luxury deals\nOf the\n10 most expensive homes\nsold in Harris County in 2025, five were within one square mile of each other in Houston\u2019s River Oaks neighborhood. The gates estate at 2110 River Oaks Boulevard topped the list. It\u2019s one of the 31 River Oaks homes designed by legendary architect John Staub between 1924 and 1958. It was last listed for $18.9 million, about $2,000 per square foot. Compass Real Estate agent Laura Sweeney represented the buyer and seller.\nGoogle turns on at Austin\u2019s Sail Tower\nAt long last,\nGoogle has moved\ninto Austin\u2019s 35-story, 804,000-square-foot Sail Tower after signing a full-building lease at the building in 2019. The tower, at 601 West Second Street in Downtown Austin, had been conspicuously vacant since its completion in 2022, a situation estimated to have cost Google about $53 million annually in rent. Despite having a full-building lease, Google is marketing the top six floors for sublease, with Digital Realty Trust identified as a potential subtenant.",

        "content": "Housing isn\u2019t the only marquee issue for San Franciscans, but it does lead a litany of challenges that includes an office vacancy rate above 30 percent despite gains from the still blossoming artificial intelligence industry, slow construction permitting and the general vibe of an increasingly pugnacious Trump administration.\nAll of that, and more, arose on Wednesday, as the three major candidates vying to replace Rep. Nancy Pelosi as San Francisco\u2019s voice in Washington D.C. gathered before a packed auditorium and tried to convince voters of their vision for the city.\nStill, when asked for the most pressing issue, state Sen. Scott Wiener,\nthe race\u2019s most high-profile candidate\n, immediately pointed to housing. Indeed, over the course of the evening, Wiener, San Francisco Supervisor Connie Chan, and Saikat Chakrabarti, who formerly worked as chief of staff for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, laid out their competing proposals to address the city\u2019s housing shortage\nLittle wonder in San Francisco, a city\nmandated to permit 82,000 new housing units by 2031\n.\nCould the feds help?\n\u201cThe federal government used to play a huge role in housing in this country,\u201d said Wiener, who, since arriving at the legislature in 2017, has authored some of the most ambitious housing bills in California\u2019s history. \u201cWe need massive investment in affordable housing, in social housing, mixed-income social housing in this country.\u201d\nWiener called for providing incentives for cities to more rapidly permit construction so as to keep federal grants and loans from getting bogged down in bureaucracy. He also said he would prioritize modernizing the construction industry, and stabilizing the local skilled workforce.\nChakrabarti said the city\u2019s efforts to rezone neighborhoods and speed up permitting, while good on paper, has failed to actually produce housing. He talked about bringing back the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, a New Deal agency from the 1930s that provided low-interest loans to developers and stockpiled steel and lumber to insulate the effect of inflation on critical construction materials. Chakrabarti also said he wanted to repeal the Faircloth Amendment, part of the 1998 federal bill that restricts new social housing construction.\nChan, a progressive\nwho many see as a foil to Wiener\u2019s build-build-build and upzone ethos\n, agreed that the city needs to build more housing but argued it was already happening. She said the city needed land and money in order to deliver \u201ctrue, real housing,\u201d and not just luxury condos for the wealthy.\n\u201cOne of the best ways to actually solve homelessness is to make sure that people can actually stay housed, and that means to preserve the existing housing that we have today, including rent controlled units,\u201d Chan said. \u201cIt\u2019s the most affordable and most valuable housing that we have in our city, and we must preserve them.\u201d\nA day after the candidate\u2019s forum, the San Francisco Chronicle reported what many in the city had been expecting:\nMayor Daniel Lurie\u2019s so-called Family Zoning Plan\n, passed late last year by the city\u2019s board of supervisors, would face a legal challenge. The plan, which upzoned parts of the city that haven\u2019t added additional housing stock in decades, was set to go into effect Monday, but may be paused due to the litigation. The lawsuit, filed by San Francisco Neighborhoods United and Small Business Forward, attempts to compel the city to further study the plan\u2019s impact on city infrastructure, historic resources, and at-risk communities before it goes into effect.\nWhile Lurie\u2019s housing solution faces a snag, one of the city\u2019s most embattled development sites may finally get unlocked. The Oceanwide Center, a two-tower proposal that broke ground in 2021 and was supposed to produce the city\u2019s second tallest skyscraper behind the Salesforce Tower, has sat abandoned for years. Now, the project\u2019s China-based lender, Haitong International Equity Investment Management, has taken control of the property and expects to put it to auction on January 15. The San Francisco Business Times is reporting that the San Francisco Recovery Fund \u2014 a new venture from long-time local developer Dan Kingsley and his business partner, Jay Yang \u2014 is\npoised to purchase the property for $100 million\n. The fund put down a\nnonrefundable deposit on the property in December.\nYang declined\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nrequest for comment, saying only that his fund was in the process of closing on the purchase.\n",

The\nNew York Post\n,\u00a0 true to form, characterized the Palisades as a \u201cwasteland.\u201d\nThe Wall Street Journal\nstruck a balance calling the recovery \u201cslow and uneven,\u201d driven by factors such as wealth and red tape reduction.\nThe lookbacks on everything from the handling of the fires\u2019 containments to insurance and rebuilding costs have flowed freely. It was solutions and calls for accountability that were sought at a hard-hitting demonstration under the banner of \u201cThey Let Us Burn,\u201d held on the January 7 anniversary of the infernos. The rally shut down Antioch Street and Swarthmore Avenue in the Palisades, with a crowd of several hundred gathered on the streets, some standing on top of the CVS building to listen for next steps. For some, that involves litigation. For others, it\u2019s calling for policy reform. Still others \u2014 more specifically former reality TV star Spencer Pratt, who announced his bid for mayor at the protest \u2014 want to shake up Los Angeles City Hall.\nNourmand &amp; Associates\u2019 Rochelle Atlas Maize, while not a speaker at the rally, was in attendance, reflecting an interest in the circumstances of multiple clients still dealing with the aftermath of the fires and \u201ceffectively frozen\u201d from moving forward. She pointed to long-term problems that have been building well before last year\u2019s wildfires, including permit fees, Measure United to House L.A. (ULA), construction costs and delays. Atlas Maize said policy makers should stop looking at those items in isolation and instead see their points of connection to figure out a way forward.\n\u201cWe cannot keep rebuilding communities without reforming how insurance, permitting and infrastructure planning work together,\u201d she told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cHomeowners need guidance, predictability and protection \u2014 not just during the rebuild, but permanently. If we don\u2019t fix that, this will repeat itself again and again.\u201d\nResi brokerage change afoot?\nSpeaking of the need for change, that\u2019s exactly what former Compass California president Mark McLaughlin told\nsubscribers\nin a Friday newsletter weighing in on the\nCompass-Anywhere deal\nclosing.\nThe deal included $1.6 billion in stock and Compass buying Anywhere\u2019s $2.6 billion in debt for a combined value of $4.2 billion. The headcount of the merged entity is some 340,000 agents.\nMcLaughlin\u2019s served as Compass California president between September 2018 and December 2020. He bounced back to the firm in 2023 as chief real estate strategist. After that two-year contract ended, the executive moved to a\npart-time mergers and acquisitions advisory role\nat the brokerage.\nMcLaughlin suggested to his followers the Compass-Anywhere combination has the leverage to reframe who serves who in the ecosystem of MLSs and agents. From McLaughlin\u2019s view, the short answer is portals need to \u201clisten and, in turn, shape a compelling offering\u201d for their customers.\n\u201cOur industry has been too tolerant of demands, constrictive rules and, in some instances, fines,\u201d McLaughlin said in his newsletter.\nTime will tell if a power shift is realized.\nCorona del Mar movement\nChange is also happening in coastal Orange County.\nThe Agency poached\nJohn Stanaland and his six-person team\nfrom Douglas Elliman, while also bringing on Craig Knizek as managing director in its Corona del Mar office.\nThe Agency co-founder Mauricio Umansky called Orange County a \u201ccornerstone market\u201d for the brokerage and said the latest additions are aimed at \u201clong-term impact\u201d regionally.\nThe office additions bring its headcount to 55 \u2014 a sizable operation that backs what Umansky\u2019s saying in a market that not all L.A.-based firms have broken into for various reasons.\nEven still, some Los Angeles brokerages have made their plays into the coastal enclave. That includes Douglas Elliman\u2019s Altman Brothers Team and the Oppenheim Group. Both have offices in Corona del Mar. Carolwood Estates entered Newport Beach through what is now a former affiliation with the Caruso Group (no relation to developer Rick Caruso).\nRemembering Sandra Miller\nMany have been spending recent weeks in remembrance of\nSandra Miller\n, the founder of Engel &amp; V\u00f6lkers Santa Monica.\nThe brokerage confirmed this past week Miller\u2019s passing during the holidays.\nOne word that has been repeatedly used by her colleagues to describe Miller: powerhouse.\nShe was the first California licensee to bring the German-based brokerage to the state and was also heavily involved in the industry. She had a seat on the California Association of Realtors Board of Directors and also held several leadership positions with the National Association of Realtors and Greater Los Angeles Association of Realtors.\nMiller\u2019s legacy in Santa Monica and beyond will continue with the office now being helmed by her son Steven Walter and brokerage manager Raymond Dominguez.\n",

        "content": "Kilroy Realty has made another move to reshape its portfolio, shedding another not-so-occupied property as the company faces a wave of\nlease expirations\n.\nThe deal for the Sunset Media Center looks like a discount for joint venture Hankey Investment Company \u2014 owned by billionaire Don Hankey, who put up President Donald Trump\u2019s $175 million bond in his New York civil fraud case \u2014 and\nBarker Pacific Group.\nThe new owners paid $61 million for the 22-story, 326,000 square foot office, which comes to about $187 a square foot, with a Measure ULA tax bill of $3.6 million, according to property records. Located at 6255 West Sunset Boulevard in the heart of Hollywood \u2014 about two blocks from the Walk of Fame \u2014 the property is 51 percent occupied.\nHankey funded the debt for the purchase but amount was not disclosed; per the deed of trust, it is a $42 million note.\nKilroy\u2019s Los Angeles portfolio encompassed 53 properties, more than 4.5 million square feet of rentable space, and was 74 percent occupied, as of the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2025. In Los Angeles, 42 leases that amount to 507,000 square feet, or about 4 percent of its leased space, are set to expire this year.\nKilroy sold a Santa Monica office building that was only 65 percent occupied last July. Then the real estate investment trust purchased Maple Plaza, a Beverly Hills office campus that was 75 percent leased at the time and marked the company\u2019s entry to the wealthy enclave \u2014 and may have given chief executive Angela Aman one of her better earnings call talking points since she took the corner office. Maple Plaza, she said on a third-quarter earnings call, had \u201cbecome the strongest driver of leasing activity in our Los Angeles portfolio.\u201d\nThe latest sale took Kilroy back to trimming inventory \u2014 and time will tell which way the REIT will lean on deals in 2026.\nCalendar item\nSpeaking of 2026 \u2026 Happy New Year! You know what that means? Earnings season, annual reports and proxies. Time to see how Los Angeles\u2019 publicly traded commercial real estate companies fared, and how much they\npaid\ntheir executives. Stay tuned.\nGood news out of the Valley\nIn Oct. 2025,\nThe Real Deal\nwrote\nthe Encino Financial Center, a 13-story office building owned by Lowe Enterprises, received an appraisal that reduced its value by almost a third. That was after its loan landed in special servicing due to imminent monetary default. The nearly 230,000-square-foot office building at 16133 Ventura Boulevard is still valued at about $49 million compared to $72 million at loan issuance in February 2015, which is more than the $39 million debt connected to the property.\nBut a loan modification was closed, and the note was extended to Nov. 2026, according to Morningstar, which buys Lowe more time. The borrower funded $2.5 million in new capital as part of the modification terms, per Morningstar. And, the three largest tenants, all of which had lease expirations next year, have extended their leases.\nEl Segundo trade\nDowntown Los Angeles offices are still bumping along bottom, and even discounted deals are commanding pricier amounts on a per square foot basis in submarkets beyond the city\u2019s center.\u00a0 Take Majestic Asset Management and AVG Partners\u2019 recent El Segundo\nbuy\n. The three-story office building traded hands for $121.5 million, or about $405 a square foot.\nThat is less than the $170 million, or about $560 per square foot, Ocean West Capital Partners and Lionstone Investments purchased the real estate at 777 South Aviation Boulevard for pre-pandemic. But it is more per square foot, than the priciest office\ntrade\nlast year: Uncommon Developers\u2019 purchase of a Brookfield-owned downtown skyscraper for $210 million, or $201 a square foot.\nEl Segundo\u2019s office sector is nowhere near as distressed as downtown\u2019s, but isn\u2019t as\nprosperous\nas Century City\u2019s either.\nBlackstone checks out\nBlackstone\nditched\nan extended-stay, Marriott-branded hotel in Torrance, near Redondo Beach, for about $54 million, or roughly $218,000 per key. The buyer of the Residence Inn at 3701 Torrance Boulevard is Capital Insight.\nOn a per room basis, in Los Angeles County, it isn\u2019t as distressed as it could be, but still reflects an ongoing hospitality rut. It\u2019s more than lender Corten Real Estate Partners\u2019\npurchase\n, via auction, of the Line in Koreatown for $68 million, or $177,000 a room \u2014 but less than Pebblebrook Hotel Trust\u2019s sale of the Montrose in West Hollywood for roughly $44 million, or about $333,000 a room.\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s a new year, but in Surfside, the arguments sound familiar.\nA recently proposed Live Local Act project is stirring local opposition, even as state lawmakers look to double-down on the pro-development workforce housing law that has\nriled up residents\nand local governments across the state.\nA pair of developers submitted plans in November for an 11-story, 33-unit residential and hotel project on 95th Street in Surfside. An affiliate of the site owner, New York-based Postal Realty Trust led by Andrew Spodek, and an entity called Ocean Walk Surfside LLC, filed the application.\nThe building would replace a single-story pink post office that was built in the 1950s.\nSurfside Mayor Charles Burkett called it a \u201cdisaster.\u201d Burkett went further. He said it\u2019s outrageous that Florida politicians have \u201cdecided to destroy the fabric and composition of small towns\u201d via the Live Local Act.\nLive Local became law in 2023. It encourages the development of workforce housing, limited to tenants earning a maximum of 120 percent of the area median income, by giving developers density, height, parking and tax incentives, among other things.\nThe law has stripped cities of their approval power. If developers comply with the requirements of the law, they can bypass public hearings to obtain approvals administratively.\nThe law has also riled up a number of towns and their residents.\nAside from concerns over additional strain on already congested roads, opponents of the project cited potential issues with crowded schools, and an erosion of the town\u2019s right to determine its development fate.\nTown staff members are reviewing the application.\nLawmakers in Tallahassee will likely be unphased, as they have been in years past, by calls to return power to municipalities or help control overdevelopment.\nAmong the real estate bills that could be considered this legislative session is Senate Bill 1548, which was filed late last week by Sen. Alexis Calatayud. The bill expands the properties that qualify for Live Local to include any property owned by a county, municipality or school district. In those cases, the property owner would have to be a party to the application and those projects must be within the geographical boundaries of their respective county, municipality or school district.\nCounties would also be barred from restricting height of Live Local Act projects through other means \u2014 i.e. setbacks or stepbacks.\nThe bill has some other quirks. Farms and farm operations are not considered commercial or industrial properties.\nKeep an eye for our additional reporting on this and other real estate-related bills the legislature could take up this session, which starts on Monday.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nDo you expect more of a crackdown on Venezuelan investment in South Florida following Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s capture and arrest, or the opposite? Are your Venezuelan clients listing their U.S. properties for sale? Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential:\nThe mansion at 1460 North Lake Way in Palm Beach changed hands for $72 million. British investor\nPamela W. Starret\nsold the nearly 1-acre property to a hidden buyer. The roughly 16,000-square-foot house has six bedrooms, six full bathrooms and three half baths.\nCommercial\n: In Coral Gables, DWS Group sold\nthe Alhambra\n, a two-building office complex at 2 Alhambra Plaza and 95 Merrick Way for $119.6 million. Dallas-based Lone Star Funds, Jay Caplin\u2019s Miami-based Square2 Capital and David Moret\u2019s Highline Real Estate Capital bought the property.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nA waterfront estate in Palm Beach hit the market\nfor $105 million\n. The seven-bedroom, nine-bathroom compound sits on an acre at 790 South County Road. It\u2019s on the market with Christian Angle of Christian Angle Real Estate. The Maurice Fatio-designed Mediterranean home spans more than 17,000 square feet, including outdoor space, and it includes a carriage house, four-car garage, library, gym, dining room that sits 30 people, a pool and dock. Property records show it sold for about\n$31 million in 2021\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\nBillionaire and Google co-founder Larry Page is the mystery buyer who purchased two waterfront properties in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove for a combined $173 million. Fellow Google co-founder Sergey Brin also made an offer to buy a waterfront home on Allison Island in Miami Beach for about $50 million \u2014\nrecord deals\nthat represent the tiniest fraction of their combined net worths.\nElsewhere in\nFlorida\nMiami\nThe Miami Hurricanes will be\nplaying for the championship\nafter beating Ole Miss at the Fiesta Bowl last week. Miami will play for its first national championship since the 2001 season, and they\u2019ll do it on their home turf at Steve Ross\u2019 Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens. (Also on that note, Ross fired former Miami Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel. I\u2019ll miss the\nmemes\n.)\nThe Miami Police Department\u2019s Internal Affairs is investigating former Mayor Francis Suarez\u2019s gifting Rolex watches to four police sergeants-at-arms at the end of his tenure as mayor, the\nMiami New Times\nreports.\nA Coral Gables man pleaded guilty to careless boating in the Biscayne Bay death of 15-year-old Ella Adler, the daughter of Miami developer Matthew Adler, after running over the teen as she was wakeboarding behind a yacht. Under the plea deal, the boater will serve probation and avoid a formal conviction. Adler addressed the court and called for stricter boating regulations, the\nMiami Herald\nreports.",

The McGinleys reached a settlement in December with the buyers, Jason and Courtney Kuhn, who took them to court last year to enforce the sale. The terms of the agreement are not public in court records.\nIn texts surfaced in court filings, the McGinleys\u2019 broker, Jameson Sotheby\u2019s\nTim Salm\n, said Jack McGinley knew that he would eventually lose the lawsuit, but the litigation would give him time to stay there.\n\u201cJack said the litigators said it will take 2-3 years for them to win, and he\u2019s 78 and will give him that time to live in the house which is worth it,\u201d Salm wrote in a text message to the lawyer who worked with the McGinleys on the sale.\nIn another text, Salm said the buyers will \u201cwin the lawsuit and ultimately get the house. He knows it.\u201d Salm did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe lawsuit centered on the botched deal over the 9,000-square-foot home at 1336 North State Parkway, which fell apart after Julie McGinley grew more and more uncertain with the decision to sell the house, according to deposition testimony from the McGinleys.\nIt\u2019s not the first time the McGinleys were accused of treating contracts as optional. The Harold B. Smith Foundation is suing the McGinleys for canceling a $37.5 million offer to buy\nAloha Lodge\nin Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.\nAccording to that lawsuit, the McGinleys canceled a pending contract to buy a Palm Beach, Florida home from the same foundation just a few days before the agreed-upon closing date in 2023. In a separate incident with different sellers, according to the foundation\u2019s complaint, the McGinleys pulled out of a contract to buy a Lake Geneva home before closing. The couple entered into a contract to buy the same property two years later, then terminated it again, prompting a Wisconsin lawsuit in 2020, according to the foundation\u2019s complaint.\nThe Harold B. Smith Foundation said in the filing the McGinleys have a \u201cpattern of signing binding contracts and then not closing the transactions.\u201d\nBeyond the\nGold Coast\nhome,\nthe McGinleys\nown houses in Lake Forest; Santa Ynez, California, and South Dartmouth, Massachusetts, according to court documents.\nThe McGinleys, Courtney Kuhn, and their attorneys did not respond to requests for comment.\nSince the terms of the settlement are private, it\u2019s not clear if the McGinleys ended up handing over the Gold Coast property to the Kuhns. No property record showing the transfer of the property is available. However, in September, when the suit was ongoing, a record was filed indicating the McGinleys paid off a $6 million mortgage they had taken out on the house in 2020.\nThe signature\nDuring negotiations over the Gold Coast house, the McGinleys\u2019 lawyer, Julie Moltz-Matgous, requested an extension to the original contract that allowed the McGinleys to pull out of the deal by May 21. The original contract, signed March 22, had a 14-day window for either party to cancel. In response, the Kuhns requested that the change allow either party to cancel the contract by the new date.\nMoltz-Matgous sent a subsequent letter denying that request and withdrawing the request to change the contract. But on May 21, after the deadline to cancel the contract, Moltz-Matgous sent a letter to the Kuhns\u2019 attorney notifying them that the closing, which was scheduled for June 2, was canceled.\nTo back up their legal right to cancel the contract, the McGinleys argued in court that Jack McGinley, who signed the contract, was not authorized to make decisions for JJR Holdings, the LLC that owned the home. The sole member of JJR Holdings is JCM Trust, and the McGinleys argued Julie McGinley was the only beneficiary of that trust.\nBut the plaintiffs produced a 2013 document in discovery that lists Jack McGinley as a trustee of JCM Trust. The McGinleys argued that joint ownership was only temporary, and the trust was transferred back to Julie McGinley later. In a court filing, the McGinleys\u2019 attorneys pointed to Secretary of State records that show Julie McGinley is the \u201csole member\u201d of JCM Trust.\nThe plaintiffs argued that Jack McGinley had previously signed documents for JJR Holdings, and even if he technically lacked authority to sign, the contract was still valid because Julie McGinley agreed through her conduct. They noted that she allowed inspections to occur, permitted her attorney to negotiate contract modifications and accepted the earnest money deposit without objection, thereby validating the contract after the fact.\nSeller\u2019s remorse\nThe McGinleys\u2019 deposition testimony paints Jack McGinley as the hard-driving dealmaker and Julie McGinley as a reluctant participant who had never fully agreed to the sale.\nJack McGinley said when the Kuhns\u2019 offer came in, Julie McGinley wasn\u2019t happy with the offer. Jack McGinley said he told his wife \u201cwe can always get out\u201d and pushed her to move forward with the deal, according to court documents.\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve done with every property we own, I coerced, I pushed,\u201d Jack McGinley said. \u201cI usually get my way, so I drove hard to get this deal done.\u201d\nJulie McGinley said she was never on board, and wanted to sell the house for a higher price. The McGinleys paid $7.1 million for the house in 2013, property records show, and she said in her testimony they had made close to $4 million in renovations. But she said she never told her broker or attorney that she objected to his signature on the contract, according to court documents.\n\u201cI won\u2019t say I went along with it. I disagreed with it vehemently,\u201d she said in deposition testimony. \u201dI just knew the deal wasn\u2019t done, and I was trying to convince him we\u2019re getting out of this.\u201d\nJack McGinley said in the deposition he told Moltz-Matgous to cancel the contract after a conversation with his wife where she refused to sell the house.\n\u201cShe was the most upset I\u2019ve ever seen her,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I thought up until that point I could convince her to sell the property.\u201d\n",

        "content": "As Chicago\u2019s industrial sector stabilizes following a\npandemic-era boom of activity\n, data centers are propping up the market, year-end data from Savills shows.\nDuring each of the first three quarters of 2025, less than 10 million square feet of industrial space was under construction in the Chicago area, according to Savills\u2019 report. But during the fourth quarter, that number began to tick up again and landed at 13 million square feet, driven mostly by incoming data center developments.\nThose numbers are still far below the construction activity seen during the peak of the pandemic. In the last quarter of 2022, nearly 40 million square feet of industrial space was under construction in the Chicago area, according to Savills.\nAs work-from-home policies caused office demand to plummet, industrial development became a safe haven for investors. Chicago is particularly well-suited to such projects because of its\nextensive rail network and access to freshwater\n.\nStill, that level of activity has tapered off in recent years since the pandemic.\nIndustrial asking rents rose 2.1 percent in 2025, year-over-year, to $7.94 per square foot, but with concessions factored in, net effective rent stayed roughly the same compared to 2024 in much of the Chicago area.\nNet absorption improved significantly last year, indicating that the region\u2019s supply is doing a better job matching demand from tenants. By the end of 2024, about 400,000 more square feet of space was leased than vacated. In the last quarter of 2025, that figure jumped up to 7.3 million square feet.\nBuyers are still interested in the market too. The highest dollar sale in Cook County last year was\nNorthPoint Development\u2019s purchase of a $270 million industrial portfolio\nin the Northwest suburbs to NorthPoint Development,\na TRD data analysis found\n. The seller was Massachusetts-based seller High Street Logistics.\nIt was the only sale that came in over $200 million last year.",

The firms will control 113-121 Prince Street for 25 years in exchange for a little over $50 million, according to city records. The lease also gives the option to extend to 2091.\nIt\u2019s the latest retail deal in Soho, where asking rents have picked up. The neighborhood is now the most expensive retail corridor south of Times Square, according to a\n2025 report\nfrom the Real Estate Board of New York.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no availability in Soho right now and there\u2019s still a ton of tenants who want to be there,\u201d said Jeffrey Kohn, founder of Hilltop.\nAsking rents on Broadway between Houston and Broome are still significantly less than they were at their peak in 2015. But at a median of $604 per square foot, they\u2019ve basically doubled from their pandemic lows in 2021. Asking rents on that strip rose more than 26 percent between 2024 and 2025, according to REBNY. (The storefronts on Prince Street are about two blocks west of Broadway.)\nThat\u2019s not the same for every neighborhood. Herald Square, for instance, has not seen the same level of retailer interest. Median asking rents on West 34th Street between Fifth and Seventh Avenues are only $447 per square foot.\nSoho has stood out in part for its visuals, Kohn said. Last year, apparel brand Ralph Lauren paid $132 million to buy its retail condo next door to the new acquisition, at 109 Prince Street.\nThe storefronts at 113-121 Prince are currently leased to clothiers Ba&amp;sh, Sandro and Farm Rio. The units comprise about 8,250 square feet on the ground floor and 7,000 square feet of basement.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a fantastic and historically designated location for over 50 years and we think it will stand the test of time for the next 50 plus,\u201d said Todd Rich, cofounder and head of real estate at Declaration Partners.\nThe lessor was an affiliate of Soho Development Corp and Rocco Buonpane signed the memorandum of lease for the company.

Financing for the three trades was arranged by Polaris Funding, according to a press release from the\nLakewood\n, New Jersey-based mortgage brokerage.\nFor this deal, Four Corners picked up The Oaks at Grand West Apartments, a built-to-rent community at 10415 Lancaster Forest Lane. The firm paid $36 million for the 290,000-square-foot, 147-unit rental home community built in 2024, according to the release. The deal works out to about $245,000 per unit.\nNate Hyman, founder of Polaris, arranged financing for the deal, a $25.2 million loan from New York-based Encore Finance Group, loan documents show.\n\u201cThis went very [smoothly] and had a closing period of under 60 days because of Polaris\u2019 relationship with the lender and the understanding we have for the BTR space,\u201d Hyman said in an email.\nHyman also arranged the financing for Four Corners\u2019 $55.2 million purchase of two built-to-rent communities in Slidell, Louisiana, totaling 248 units. The trade worked out to $222,400 per unit.\nThe Oaks at Grand West Apartments features three- and four-bedroom rental homes that range in size from 1,800 square feet to 2,000 square feet, each with laundry facilities, a two-car garage, covered patio and fenced-in backyard, according to the property\u2019s website. Shared amenities include a dog park and playground. Rents at the property start at about $2,400 per month.\nBuilt-to-rent properties, which offer some of the same perks as a single-family home, soared in popularity during the pandemic when remote work and lockdowns kept people confined to their homes.\nThese rental properties also offer an alternative to vertical living for would-be homebuyers kept on the sidelines by the highly competitive seller\u2019s market of 2020 and 2021 and then the high interest rates that have plagued the market since 2022.\nThe trend has really taken off in Texas, where nearly 22,000 built-to-rent units were in the pipeline in the beginning of 2025 \u2014 the most of any state in the country, according to a report from Point2Homes. At the city level, Phoenix led the nation,\nfollowed by Dallas\n, Atlanta and Charlotte. Houston ranked fifth, with 4,613 units under construction at the beginning of last year.\n",

        "content": "PayPal is paying attention to the rising tide of Manhattan\u2019s office leasing sector.\nThe digital commerce platform signed a lease for 261,000 square feet at 345 Hudson Street in the Hudson Square neighborhood, the New York Post\nreported\n. The 10-year lease was quietly put together before the end of last year.\nFinancial details of the lease were not disclosed. PayPal is expected to occupy three floors of the building when it moves in next year, though it\u2019s unclear what will happen to its space at 95 Morton Street.\nThe building is owned by a joint venture of Hines, Trinity Church Wall Street and Norges Bank Investment Management. Other tenants at the building include Audacy, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, Hines and Fanatics, which signed a lease for\n54,000 square feet last year\n.\nThe 17-story, 980,000-square-foot property at 345 Hudson is facing a delicate moment. While boasting a prominent tenant roster, Google is in the process of trying to\nsublease 165,000 square feet\nas it consolidates around St. John\u2019s Terminal. A year after that effort began, there\u2019s been no indication of Google finding a taker for the space.\nMore than 400,000 square feet was available at 345 Hudson Street prior to the Fanatics deal, according to CBRE marketing materials. The average asking rent in Hudson Square and the Meatpacking District in the first quarter was $99.13 per square foot, according to\nNewmark\n, a big jump year-over-year; the availability rate was 21.3 percent, one of the highest rates of any neighborhood in Manhattan.\nManhattan\noffice leasing\nreached pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter, posting its strongest quarter since late 2019. That fed into a yearly total of nearly 42 million square feet, the highest for a year since 2019.\nIncreased demand resulted in tightening market conditions. The availability rate fell to 13.9 percent and the average asking rent climbed to $76 per square foot.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Real estate fixer Mark Nussbaum is in a big mess and things don\u2019t seem to be getting much better.\nNussbaum acted as an attorney, a bridge lender, a deal connector and even a landlord, all while running his law firm Nussbaum Lowinger.\nNow he\u2019s staring down a $400 million hole with former clients alleging he misappropriated escrow funds. He\u2019s also facing criminal charges from Manhattan\u2019s District Attorney\u2019s office for allegedly stealing at least $15 million from escrow clients. (Nussbaum has pleaded not guilty). One lawsuit accuses Nussbaum Lowinger of running a\nPonzi scheme\nwith much of the money going to a now deceased Borough Park investor named Mendel Steiner.\nIn the past month, new court filings have revealed some of the most explosive information to date about the breadth of Nussbaum\u2019s influence in tri-state real estate, who he did business with and the difficulties that lie ahead for creditors trying to collect from Nussbaum\u2019s estate.\nWhat\u2019s Next For Nussbaum?\nThe Manhattan D.A.\u2019s criminal charges against Nussbaum are pending. At the time of the indictment in May, prosecutors mentioned only two victims, but noted that they believed there were more.\nNussbaum is out on bail. He has had two hearing dates, but both matters were adjourned. His next hearing is scheduled for March.\nThe case will rest on whether Nussbaum\u2019s former clients knew of his schemes. Nussbaum\u2019s legal team will likely argue the victims were aware that their escrow money was at risk or were clued in to Nussbaum\u2019s\n\u201cshow capital\u201d tactic\n, where Nussbaum would allegedly wire escrow funds to real estate dealmakers to show a lender that capital was secured. Were these victims, or investors?\nThe Debtors\nNussbaum filed an\nexhaustive list\nof all his creditors and debtors in December. He had over $400 million in creditors. But the more notable names were on the debtor side.\nThey included:\nSteiner, who had the largest debt at $306 million.\nBoruch Drillman, a Brooklyn investor who pleaded guilty for his role in a mortgage fraud conspiracy in 2023, owed $4.7 million.\nYanky Tauber\n, Nussbaum\u2019s deal partner on Chicago real estate, owes $1.5 million.\nOpal Holdings head\nShaya Prager\n, owed $1.1 million.\nIn civil court, Nussbaum and his former law firms Nussbaum Lowinger and Mark J Nussbaum &amp; Associates entered into an alternative to bankruptcy, known as an assignment for the benefit of creditors. He appointed a lawyer, Sheldon Eisenberger, to handle the process. The goal is to attempt to pay the people Nussbaum owes money to.\nThe process has been a slog. Eisenberger has noted the poor state of books and records kept by Nussbaum. So far, debtors who owe Nussbaum money have been reluctant to return it, except for one person.\nThe Wolf\nThe mercurial Wolf Wercberger is the only one to reach a settlement with Eisenberger.\nWercberger recently agreed to pay about $15.3 million to resolve the ABC\u2019s claims against him. According to the settlement agreement, Wercberger deposited funds in Nussbaum\u2019s escrow accounts starting in 2022. Wercberger made back all the money he put into the funds plus $16 million to $19 million in extra proceeds.\nEisenberger agreed to Wercberger\u2019s payment, citing the poor state of Nussbaum\u2019s books and records and Nussbaum\u2019s lack of credibility if the matter were to be litigated in court, according court filings as part of the ABC.\nEisenberger says that Wercberger made the payment in part to encourage others to make payments to help the ABC pay \u201cinnocent parties\u201d who had likely lost money with Nussbaum. This includes people who used Nussbaum Lowinger\u2019s escrow services to buy family residences.\n\u201cThe settlement will infuse the estate with needed capital to pay out certain categories of creditors immediately and make it more likely all creditors receive distributions,\u201d Eisenberger said in a court filing.\nIt remains unclear why Wercberger would care about helping other creditors getting paid back.\nThere is another possible motivation: The settlement, if approved by the court, could stop future claims brought by Nussbaum creditors against Wercberger.\nWercberger has been a\nprominent figure\nin the Nussbaum saga and has been sued before by another Nussbaum creditor. Jacob Sod, a nursing home executive who was the first to file a lawsuit against Nussbaum, also filed a lawsuit against Wercberger claiming Nussbaum gave $15 million of his money to Wercberger as\n\u201chush money\n\u201d to prevent Wercberger from going to federal authorities.\nWercberger denied the claims and said Sod\u2019s attorneys were \u201crunning all over town, intimidating all of my business contacts and associates.\u201d In June, a Kings County judge dismissed Sod\u2019s claims, but Sod\u2019s lawyers are appealing the ruling.\nNussbaum\u2019s alleged tactics\nNussbaum Lowinger\u2019s clients largely came from Orthodox jewish communities in\nLakewood\n, New Jersey, Brooklyn and Monsey, New York. Nussbaum allegedly offered certain clients a lucrative opportunity. If they sent over funds into his firm\u2019s escrow accounts he would pay a return.\nOne of Nussbaum\u2019s alleged means of producing those high returns was through a novel move called \u201c\nshow capital.\n\u201d Nussbaum would wire escrow funds to real estate dealmakers to show a lender they had enough capital to close on a transaction. The money would appear in the accounts for a short-time, just long enough for a lender to agree to the deal, according to lawsuits and court documents.\nEssentially, Nussbaum\u2019s \u201cshow capital\u201d move allowed a real estate dealmaker to obtain a loan with no equity. Nussbaum would collect a fee along the way.\nBut at some point Nussbaum ran into a deficit and he could not pay back his clients in full. One client, nursing home executive Sod, filed a lawsuit in January demanding Nussbaum return $15 million in escrow funds. That lawsuit triggered more Nussbaum Lowinger clients to file their own suits, claiming that Nussbaum would not return their escrow money.\nQuestions were raised about where the money went.\nAt least $300 million went to a 33-year old Borough Park investor Mendel Steiner, according to Nussbaum\u2019s court filings. One lawsuit alleges Nussbaum transferred the money to Steiner who was supposed to buy properties. But Steiner never bought the properties and instead used fictitious names and contracts in an attempt to prove that money was going to legitimate deals, the lawsuit alleges.\nSteiner died by suicide in January 2025. Days later Nussbaum Lowinger\nshut down\nhis law firm.\n",

        "content": "Amli Residential is shaking up its C-suite for the first time in its 45-year history, handing the CEO reins to a new generation.\nThe Chicago-based multifamily owner and developer promoted Fred Schreiber to CEO from his prior role as executive vice president and chief operating officer,\naccording\nto CoStar. Taylor Bowen, previously president of Amli Development, will now serve as CEO of that affiliate, overseeing the firm\u2019s ground-up pipeline.\nLongtime Chairman and CEO\nGregory Mutz\nis not exiting the stage entirely. He\u2019ll remain chairman, while former Amli President Philip Tague steps into the vice chairman role. The moves formalize a succession plan that has been quietly underway for several years and keeps the company\u2019s founding leadership closely involved, Mutz said in an email to the outlet, adding that Schreiber and Bowen have steadily taken on more responsibility during the transition.\nAfter months of stagnation, U.S. multifamily rents ticked up slightly in December, snapping five straight months of flat or negative growth, according to data from CoStar-owned Apartments.com. While the bump is modest, it\u2019s a welcome signal for large operators navigating higher interest rates, tighter capital markets and a wave of new supply in several Sun Belt metros.\nAmli, founded in 1980 by Mutz and fellow attorney John Allen, has lived through multiple cycles. The firm went public in 1994 as Amli Residential Properties Trust, before Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investing paid $2.1 billion to take it private in 2006. Today, the company remains a subsidiary of Morgan Stanley and controls roughly 26,000 apartments nationwide, with an estimated value of $12.5 billion, according to Mutz.\nThe firm has continued to transact and plan new development. In one recent deal, Amli paid $134 million for the 275-unit\nMilieu tower\nin Chicago\u2019s West Loop. It\u2019s also pursuing a 56-story,\n498-unit apartment tower\nat 669 North Michigan Avenue, a high-profile proposal along the Magnificent Mile.\nSchreiber will remain based at Amli\u2019s Chicago headquarters, while Bowen operates out of\nDallas\n.

It tracks listings of homes and condos asking $4 million and up in Miami-Dade that are included in the Multiple Listing Service. The properties spent 135 days on the market, on average.\nForty-eight luxury listings were added to the market, for a total of 1,287 listings.\nThe\nprevious week\n, buyers signed seven contracts for properties in Miami-Dade, asking a combined $79 million.\nThe asking dollar volume for the 11 single-family homes and 12 condos under contract last week totals $242.7 million, according to the report published by the Douglas Elliman team led by Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes.\nThe single-family homes that entered into contract last week have an average asking price of $10.6 million and spent an average of 144 days on the market. They total $116.6 million in asking dollar volume.\nWeissmann and his wife Trudy are selling their longtime home at 6620 Allison Road. The seven-bedroom, seven-bathroom house spans about 6,500 square feet on a 0.5-acre lot. Jordan Karp has the listing. The Weissmanns paid just $1.5 million for the property in 2000.\nThe property is next door to the waterfront house that Google co-founder Sergey Brin reportedly\nmade an offer to purchase\n, sources told\nThe Real Deal\nlast week.\nThe condos that secured buyers last week have an average asking price of $10.5 million and spent 127 days on the market, on average. They total $126.1 million in asking dollar volume, or an average of $2,800 per square foot.\nAt the top is a four-bedroom, three-bathroom condo at\nContinuum\n, at 100 South Point Drive in Miami Beach. A company tied to real estate investor Ralph Winter paid $13.8 million for the 5,049-square-foot unit in 2018. Coldwell Banker\u2019s Jonathan Corso and Jorge Martinez have the listing. It\u2019s now asking $24.3 million, over $4,800 per square foot.\nLast week in New York, buyers signed contracts for 20 homes, according to the latest Olshan\nreport\n. Their combined asking price is $147.4 million, and the typical home spent 1,129 days on the market.\n",

J.B. Pritzker\n, is now\non the market\nfor $135 million, down from its previous asking price of $175 million, Crain\u2019s Chicago Business reported. It\u2019s the second time the 50,000-square-foot manse has taken a haircut since it hit the market in late 2024 for nearly $200 million.\nPritzker\u2019s estate is\nat the center of his divorce\nfrom now ex-wife Jeanne, who reportedly only learned she never had any legal ownership of the house when the couple separated in 2022. The home was owned by legal entities that did not include her. When they parted ways, Tony bought a $19.5 million condominium a few miles away, and Jeanne learned via Tony\u2019s attorneys that she\nwasn\u2019t entitled\nto live in the house because she is not associated with the trust that owns it, the Wall Street Journal previously reported.\nThe home first\nwent up for sale\nin October 2024 for $195 million. The price fell by $20 million the following April.\nEven with today\u2019s listing price being approximately 69 percent of what the billionaire originally sought for the property, if it sold for $135 million it would still surpass the country\u2019s\npriciest home sale of 2025\n, a $133 million property in Naples, Florida, according to Redfin.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time [for the owners] to\nmove to the next chapter\n,\u201d listing agent Kurt Rappaport of Westside Estate Agency told Mansion Global. \u201cThey\u2019re ready to pass the torch.\u201d\nAt 50,000 square feet, the home is one of the largest in the U.S., rivaling the 55,000-square-foot\nWhite House\n. Spanning 16 bedrooms and 27 bathrooms, the main house on the Pritzker Estate boasts a theater, a game room, a bowling alley, a wellness center, a gym and a wine cellar, according to the listing. To stay warm and cool, the home also has 18 fireplaces, solar panels and a heating and cooling system powered by geothermal technology. There\u2019s also a separate two-story, two-bedroom guest house, parking for up to 100 vehicles, a green marble infinity pool and hot tub, a lighted tennis court with a pavilion and an outdoor kitchen.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The landlord alleges the National Urban League defaulted on more than $400,000 in payments.\nFiled in New York state Supreme Court, the lawsuit alleges the nonprofit\u2019s lease expired on June 30, but the organization failed to leave until early August.\nThe nonprofit\nrelocated to 121 West 125th Street\nin Harlem, a mixed-use project recently developed by Taconic Partners, the Prusik Group, L+M Development Partners and BRP Cos. The development includes 170 affordable housing units and the Urban Civil Rights Museum.\nBushburg did not comment to the publication on the suit, but the leader of the National Urban League threatened a countersuit.\n\u201cIt is our position that Bushburg owes compensation to the National Urban League, due to the fact that a dangerous air quality issue rendered the premises uninhabitable for an extended period during 2025,\u201d chief executive officer Marc Morial told Crain\u2019s.\nThe lawsuit draws headlines to a Financial District development looking to make news for entirely different reasons.\nOver the summer, Joseph Hoffman\u2019s firm\nlanded a $320 million construction loan\nfor one of the city\u2019s biggest office-to-residential conversion projects. Bridge City Capital and Deutsche Bank provided the financing for Bushburg\u2019s partial conversion of the 1.2 million-square-foot building.\nBushburg paid $160 million in 2024 to buy the 40-story skyscraper from the Rudin family, which developed the property in 1960.

Walker &amp; Dunlop provided the $116 million, five-year, fixed-rate Fannie Mae loan.\nThe seven-story apartment complex opened roughly 10 months ago. It sits on a four-acre parcel and is approximately three miles from the New York City border.\nA Walker &amp; Dunlop team including Aaron Appel, Jonathan Schwartz and Keith Kurland arranged the debt for the property, which also includes 44 affordable housing units. Neither of the landlords responded to requests for comment from the publication.\nRose, Amy Rose\u2019s company that specializes in the luxury multifamily sector, recently revealed that it would\nhelp facilitate\nthe conversion of a 48-story tower at 30 Broad Street in New York City\u2019s Financial District, a 571-unit project led by InterVest Capital Partners.\nGetting further outside the city, Lincoln Equities Group refinanced a recently completed industrial property in the Hudson Valley with $106 million in debt, according to the\nObserver\n.\nAffiliates of Apollo and CenterSquare Investment Management came forward with the bridge loan for Building B at Interstate Crossings in Brewster. The debt contains a future funding component that ownership will be able to pull from while leasing and stabilizing the asset, which sits at the intersection of Interstate 84 and Interstate 684.\nLincoln delivered the 618,000-square-foot warehouse last year, a potentially advantageous facility considering its accessibility to several major markets, including the New York City metro area, New England and the mid-Atlantic corridor. Minimal industrial supply is coming online in the Westchester-Putnam County market, according to JLL, due to a lack of available land for the sector.\nJLL\u2019s Peter Rotchford and Christopher Pratt negotiated the Brewster debt deal.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Business First reported. The seller was Rancho Cucamonga-based real estate developer IHC State LLC.\nDaum Commercial Real Estate Services\nfacilitated the sale. Agents Eric Fikse and Eric Burney represented the seller and Fikse also procured the buyer. IHC State was \u201cseeking a buyer that could assume the existing debt, despite a lockout provision and prepayment hurdles,\u201d Fikse said in a statement, per L.A. Business First.\nThe building at 875 West State Street is fully occupied and features 51 dock-high doors, two grade-level doors and 2,000 amps of power. The property is located approximately an hour away from Los Angeles International Airport and the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.\nThe Inland Empire industrial market has\nbeen on shaky ground\namid a slow post-pandemic recovery. In the third quarter of 2025, the Inland Empire West industrial submarket had a nearly 7.7 percent overall vacancy rate, per Daum\ndata\ncited by L.A. Business First. By contrast, the Greater Los Angeles industrial market had a 5 percent vacancy rate in the same period, according to CBRE\u2019s third-quarter report. Transaction volume reached $547.2 million in the third quarter with a median price per square foot of $275. \u201cMany property owners are holding off on selling until the market strengthens,\u201d Burney said in a statement.\nBridge Logistics Properties is one company not shying away from the I.E. industrial market. In November, the firm\nbought a 1.1-million-square-foot warehouse\nat 10681 Production Avenue in Fontana for $174 million, or $158 per square foot. It was one of the priciest transactions for an Inland Empire facility in 2025, dwarfed by Burlington Distribution\u2019s purchase of a 900,000-square-foot Riverside distribution center\nfrom BlackRock\nlast April for $257 million, or $286 per square foot.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The Upper East Side condo hit the market in May, asking just under $11.75 million. The seller bought it from the late radio host and political commentator\nRush Limbaugh\nfor just under $12 million in 2010.\nThe 4,700-square-foot apartment spans the entire 20th floor and has five bedrooms and five bathrooms. It also features four terraces and views of Central Park. The pending deal includes a third-floor studio.\nCompass\u2019 Steve Dawson, Dan Colson and the Hudson Advisory Team had the listing.\nOf the 20 properties to find buyers, 12 were condos, four were co-ops, one was a condop and three were townhouses.\nThe homes asked a combined $147 million, which works out to an average of $7.4 million and a median of $6.3 million. The typical home was on the market for more than 3 years and had a discount of 10 percent.\n",

        "content": "CC Homes, led by developers Armando Codina and Jim Carr, cashed out of their Sunrise development site planned for 900 homes for $164.5 million, a big gain in value from its price three years ago.\nNew York-based DW Partners, a land bank for homebuilding titan Lennar, bought the 160-acre former golf course at 7400 Northwest 24th Place from Coral Gables-based CC Homes and its partner Ronald DiGasbarro, according to records. DW Partners and Lennar signed a purchase option agreement for Lennar to purchase the site. The agreement expires in 2031.\nCC Homes also is entitled to receive a portion of the proceeds from each future home sale, records show.\nThe project, called Solterra, is planned for about 400 single-family homes and the remainder of the residences will be townhomes, including affordable townhomes. It\u2019s been in the works since at least 2021, when CC Homes\nscored\na development agreement with the city, including to form the Solterra Community Development District.\nCDDs\nare a common way for developers of large communities in Florida to finance roads, stormwater and sewer systems, sidewalks and other infrastructure. Once residential complexes are sold out, homeowners assume the responsibility to pay back the CDD bonds.\nCC Homes and DiGasbarro paid\n$12.3 million\nfor the site, which used to be the Sunrise Country Club.\nCodina and Carr founded residential development firm CC Homes in 2007. Separately, Codina and his daughter, Ana-Marie Codina Barlick, lead development firm Coral Gables-based Codina Partners.\nMiami-based Lennar, led by Stuart Miller, is considered the second largest homebuilder in the U.S. and the largest in\nsouth Miami-Dade County\n. It heavily relies on land banks to hold developable tracts until Lennar is ready to start building homes. This way, Lennar\noutsources\nland ownership and the risk tied to it, allowing it to carry the land off its financial books and deploy its funds toward construction instead of land ownership.\nNear Pompano Beach, Millrose Properties of Florida, which Lennar spun off as its land bank last year, paid\n$50 million\nlast month for a 20-acre development site planned for 426 condos and townhomes within The Pomp mixed-use project.\nAlso last month, DW Partners paid\n$24 million\nfor 423 homesites in the Keys Gate residential subdivision in Homestead. The seller, JEN Partners, also is a land bank for Lennar, with the homebuilder essentially switching land banks through the deal.\n",

New York Life Insurance provided the financing on Dec. 18, with the deal recorded Dec. 23. A separate Harwood-affiliated entity owns the property.\nCompleted in June 2023, the 26-story\noffice tower\nat 2801 North Harwood Street marked a design-forward expansion for the district. The 360,000-square-foot office tower was designed by Japan\u2019s Kengo Kuma &amp; Associates, with Dallas-based Corgan as architect of record. In addition to office space, the building includes restaurant space and a 17,000-square-foot rooftop and sky garden.\nThe refinancing lands amid a turbulent stretch for Harwood International. Over the past year, the developer sold four office towers to private equity giant TPG, unloading Harwood buildings No. 2, 6, 7 and 10 between early September and early October 2025. The four properties total roughly 900,000 square feet.\nIn November, law firm Jones Day, which was supposed to anchor the upcoming Harwood No. 15 at 3008 North Harwood,\npulled out\nof the project, as previously reported by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nEarlier in 2025, Harwood also sold Harwood No. 4 to Spear Street Capital after defaulting on a loan, with the San Francisco firm planning multimillion-dollar upgrades.\nThe seven-story Harwood No. 1, the district\u2019s original office building at 2651 North Harwood Street, reverted to lender First United Bank after a\nforeclosure auction\nin November, part of a series of at least four foreclosure threats faced by the developer, as Barbier-Mueller\u2019s firm also took on a\n$100 million loan\nat the end of last year.\nThat same Harwood No. 1 has now found a new owner. Dallas-based Cawley Partners purchased the nearly 106,000-square-foot building from First United Trust following the foreclosure, with a $29.5 million acquisition loan, according to deed records. The sale price was not disclosed. First United Bank\u2019s winning foreclosure bid was $27.2 million, while the Dallas Central Appraisal District values the property at $25 million.\nCawley plans to invest $10 million to modernize the building, built in 1984, updating common areas and adding 50,000 square feet of spec suites. The property is about 50 percent leased.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

It is the culmination of a years-long effort by both\nVanderbilt\nand West Palm Beach real estate heavyweights to bring the \u201cHarvard of the South\u201d to the aspiring Wall Street South. Billionaire Related Ross chairman\nSteve Ross\ncommitted $50 million to the campus in April. He\u2019s also hosted fundraisers on behalf of the school and advocated publicly for the project.\n\u201cTo pass up this opportunity would be a crime,\u201d he said at a county meeting in 2024. \u201cThere\u2019s no place that\u2019s ever grown that doesn\u2019t have great universities, great schools.\u201d\nRoss has millions of square feet of office and residential towers in the pipeline in West Palm Beach, and he\u2019s been on a mission to woo major institutions and corporations to fill them.\nCleveland Clinic\nis set to anchor his planned 15 CityPlace with a 120,000-square-foot outpatient center, and he donated $50 million to for an additional 150-bed hospital Cleveland Clinic is planning at 400 and 450 South Australian Avenue, the\nPalm Beach Post\nreported.\nAmong the other real estate donors for Vanderbilt\u2019s planned campus are billionaire Jeff Greene and\nFrisbie Group\u2019s Cody Crowell\n, an alum who committed $5 million.\nVanderbilt launched its fundraising campaign for the West Palm Beach campus last year, with a goal of $300 million. The university did not confirm the total it raised in today\u2019s announcement, but disclosed it would be launching a second phase aimed at raising $250 million.\nPalm Beach County and West Palm Beach City officials\nvoted in 2024\nto gift the university 7 acres of publicly owned land for the campus. In the same vote, county commissioners approved a development and conveyance agreement (DCA) with Vanderbilt that requires the university to spend $300 million in capital expenditures and create 4,500 construction jobs with the project. Vanderbilt must also have 200 full-time employees, 1,000 total students and a $70 million annual operating budget within five years of beginning operations.\nWest Palm Beach won\u2019t be the first satellite graduate campus for the university.

But the company did not disclose a price.\nHis holdings there \u2014 after the purchase of 9700 Wilshire Boulevard (and other parcels) from Neiman Marcus\u2019 parent company Saks Global \u2014 total 350,000 square feet of upscale retail space, according to a press release. The company did not offer much detail, but according to records signed by the billionaire, he received a $39 million construction loan note. The lender appears to be venture capital firm Arcus Ventures, which could not be immediately reached\nAshkenazy Acquisition representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Saks Global\ntold\nthe Los Angeles Times, when the deal was announced, that it \u201cmade the strategic decision to sell the land beneath the Neiman Marcus Beverly Hills store and enter into a long-term lease with the new owner.\u201d\nA construction loan signals Ashkenazy may have some sort of renovation or redevelopment plan, but it is unclear what that is \u2014 and according to Saks Global, it plans to remain a tenant. The terms of the lease were not disclosed.\nBut Saks Global is in financial trouble. The retailer is near bankruptcy,\naccording to\nmultiple reports, after it missed a debt payment of more than $100 million and days later its chief executive, Marc Metrick, resigned and was replaced by executive chairman Richard Baker.\nAshkenazy owns the former Barneys building on Wilshire Boulevard, too, which is now occupied by Saks Fifth Avenue \u2014 another Saks Global brand \u2014 and the Beverly Connection, a shopping center on La Cienega Boulevard.\nAshkenazy recently extended the loan on the mall after the debt tied to it was stuck in special servicing for years due to delinquency,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously\nreported\nThe shopping center was reappraised in December 2024 for $193 million, compared to $260 million at issuance about a decade earlier, according to Morningstar. But last summer, a spokesperson for the company said it received another appraisal \u201cin excess of $300 million.\u201d The current debt balance is $210 million, per Morningstar.\n",

        "content": "Urban Outfitters is pulling the plug on its Gold Coast outpost, creating a rare large retail availability in one of Chicago\u2019s most supply starved, high-rent neighborhoods.\nThe Philadelphia-based clothing and home goods chain will vacate its multilevel space at 1100 North State Street this month, according to signage posted at the store and brokers at CBRE marketing the property, CoStar\nreported\n. The move comes as Urban Outfitters\u2019 lease expires, roughly a decade after the retailer made a then-bold leap north from its former Rush Street site into a pocket better known for steakhouses than soft goods.\nThe vacancy sets up a real-time stress test for top-tier urban retail, which has\noutperformed\nthe broader market since the pandemic upended shopping corridors in early 2020, according to CoStar. While stretches of the Magnificent Mile continue to work through elevated vacancy and repositioning, the Gold Coast has largely thrived, buoyed by\ndense wealth\n, tourism and a restaurant scene that never fully lost its luster.\nUrban Outfitters occupied space on the ground and lower levels of the three-story building, which it shares with Maple &amp; Ash, one of the highest-grossing restaurants in the country. The steakhouse controls part of the ground floor and the entire third floor, anchoring the property with consistent foot traffic day and night.\nCBRE is seeking a new tenant for Urban\u2019s former space, with leasing options ranging from roughly 5,000 square feet to 19,007 square feet, including the vacant second floor. The property is owned by the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio and is being marketed by CBRE brokers Danny Jacobson, Stephen Ansani and Luke Molloy. The marketing brochure from CBRE does not list any asking price.\nUrban Outfitters did not respond to requests for comment from the outlet. It\u2019s unclear whether the brand could return to the\nGold Coast\nin another format. The company still operates Chicago-area stores on North Milwaukee Avenue and at Westfield Old Orchard and Oakbrook Center. Nationally, Urban Outfitters has been experimenting with new store concepts and resale-focused\nReclectic\nstores.\nJacobson told the outlet that interest is already building, with early conversations spanning apparel, food and beverage, furniture and home d\u00e9cor. Some prospects would be new to Chicago.\nThe building sits in the\nViagra Triangle\n, a nickname locals use for the affluent wedge formed by State and Rush streets and Bellevue Place. New retail is also coming online at the base of Newberry Tower Plaza, and Convexity Properties is planning apartments on the former Barnes &amp; Noble site nearby.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The property spans 66,000 square feet and is fully vacant.\nThe building was originally constructed in 1932 and was occupied by WeWork before the coworking company\nabandoned\nits offices there in 2021, the San Francisco Business Times reported. Renovations were completed in 2015 with approximately $14.7 million in capital improvements. Amenities include a rooftop deck with panoramic water views, showers and locker rooms. The four-story building is categorized as mixed-use overlay zoning, allowing office, and research and development uses.\nRealm was attracted to 340 Bryant because it\u2019s a \u201chigh-quality and functional building\u201d in \u201ca submarket poised for outperformance,\u201d Travis King, founder and CEO of Realm, said in the release. \u201cSouth Beach\u2019s resilience, combined with citywide recovery signals, suggest rapid stabilization and sustained momentum.\u201d\nIn 2023, after Pollock Financial defaulted on a UBS-originated commercial mortgage-backed securities loan tied to the\nSouth Beach\noffice building,\nappraisers slashed its value\nby 84 percent. The building was valued at $8.2 million \u2014 a significant fall from its previous value of $52 million. The distress was linked to WeWork\u2019s failure to pay rent; the company had signed a 10-year lease in 2019, but halted monthly payments in December 2020. The coworking giant ended up\nfiling for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection\nin late 2023.\nThe San Francisco office market closed out the fourth quarter with a 32.8 percent vacancy rate, according to CBRE\u2019s fourth-quarter 2025\nreport\n.

        "content": "A 1970s-era office building in the heart of\nDowntown Austin\nis up for grabs.\nHouston-based Highland Resources placed 211 Seventh on the market, according to a release from JLL Capital Markets managing director Jeff Coddington. The Austin Business Journal\nreported\nthat the brokerage team, which includes Coddington, Joe Dowdle and Ryan Stevens, is marketing the 12-story building at 211 East Seventh Street.\nBuilt on roughly 0.7 acres, the 162,000-square-foot office building sits across the street from the historic Driskill Hotel and the Omni Austin Hotel Downtown. It\u2019s also adjacent to Stream Realty Partners\u2019 ongoing remake of East Sixth Street, part of a broader effort to turn the once-raucous\n\u201cDirty Sixth\u201d\ncorridor into a more polished, all-day destination with restaurants and daytime foot traffic.\nJLL is pitching flexibility. A buyer could hold the building as offices, redevelop the site or pursue adaptive reuse, converting the structure to residential or hospitality. The asking price was not disclosed in JLL\u2019s marketing brochure, but the property was most recently appraised at $23.8 million, according to the Travis Central Appraisal District.\nThe optionality of the building comes against a challenging office backdrop. Austin\u2019s office vacancy rate stood at 25.8 percent in the third quarter, according to JLL. Still, Stevens told the outlet that some investors are positioning ahead of a projected rebound.\n\u201cWe expect the Austin\noffice capital markets\nto remain fertile ground for opportunistic, contrarian buyers positioning ahead of a 2026/2027 leasing rebound,\u201d Stevens said in an emailed statement to the publication, pointing to historically low basis levels despite elevated vacancy.\nAbout 62,000 square feet of the building at 211 Seventh is currently being marketed for lease. Based on tenant listings and signage, the building is roughly 61 percent leased, with occupants including Dealerware, ThinkOnward, Brightpearl by Sage and Suvida Healthcare. Those tenants are largely on short-term leases, Coddington said.\nThe site also carries density upside. While\nAustin\nrecently imposed a temporary 350-foot height cap downtown, developers can exceed it by participating in the Downtown Density Bonus Program. According to the publication, the parcel is eligible for a floor-to-area ratio of up to 25-to-1 and sits outside\nCapitol View Corridors\n, removing another common constraint.\nThe adaptive reuse angle could also attract interested parties, as only about 1.1 percent of Austin\u2019s office inventory is considered viable for conversion, according to research from Partners. JLL\u2019s Coddington insisted the building at 211 Seventh is an exception, citing its relatively small floor plates of about 16,700 square feet and high window-to-floor ratio, features that can make residential or hotel conversions more feasible.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Italian investor and entrepreneur Gianluca Vacchi filed a lawsuit against his partner, developer Michael Stern, over his investment in a North Beach development that has not come to fruition.\nVacchi accused Stern and two companies tied to him of a \u201cdeliberated and calculated fraud\u201d in a scathing complaint filed in December, court records show. The lawsuit was temporarily stayed \u2014 in other words paused \u2014 earlier this month, but the complaint remains active.\nVacchi\u2019s GV NBV sued Stern, 6345 JV LLC and 6345 Manager LLC over a $2.5 million investment in the Casablanca property, an oceanfront condo-hotel at 6345 Collins Avenue in Miami Beach.\nThe two\npartnered in 2024\n, forming a joint venture to invest in a $4 billion pipeline of new developments.\nVacchi joined Stern on\nMercedes-Benz Places Miami\n, the Dolce &amp; Gabbana-branded 888 Brickell and the 1250 West Avenue project in Miami Beach. But construction at Mercedes-Benz has moved slowly. At 1250 West Avenue, developer David Martin of Miami-based Terra joined Stern\nto take the lead\non the project last year.\nVacchi also partnered with Stern, Anatomy Fitness owner Chris Paciello and Rafi Gibly on Sunset Padel, an indoor padel members\u2019 only club that operates in Miami Beach\u2019s Sunset Harbour.\nVacchi is part of the wealthy Vacchi family based in Italy. He sold his stake in their IMA Group, a manufacturing empire, in 2023.\nReuters\nreported that year that the private equity firm BC Partners agreed to sell its stake in IMA to BDT &amp; MSD Partners in a deal valuing the company at about 7 billion euros. A year ago, Vacchi was sued by a project consultant based in Naples, Florida, over allegedly\nunpaid fees tied to evaluations\nof the Stern-Vacchi developments.\nVacchi\u2019s attorney, Jason Giller, declined to comment on the lawsuit involving Stern. Stern also declined to comment.\n\u201cSystematic\u201d fraud\nVacchi alleges that Stern\u2019s actions were evidence of \u201cyet another scam conjured up by Stern.\u201d\nVacchi alleges that Stern schemed him into investing $2 million into a planned redevelopment of the Casablanca, in May or June of 2024, through \u201cbrazen misrepresentations, fabricated or improperly modified documents, and concealment of material facts,\u201d according to the complaint.\nThe first $2 million investment was promised as a \u201cquick flip\u201d and a \u201cno lose\u201d proposition, according to the lawsuit.\nStern provided Vacchi\u2019s entity with what Stern allegedly claimed was a third-party valuation on the Casablanca land \u2014 valuing the site between $210 million and $276 million. Vacchi\u2019s company would become a member of Stern\u2019s LLC as part of the agreement. Vacchi pulled the trigger on the additional half a million dollars the following year. The valuation was actually created by JDS\u2019 development director, the lawsuit alleges.\nStern allegedly represented that it would cost $150 million to buy out Casablanca, according to the lawsuit, which would have allowed for a big windfall had he purchased and then flipped the property at the valuation price.\nStern has refused to give Vacchi a membership certificate that shows his investment in 6345 JV LLC. Instead, Stern claims that GV Development Group, not GV NBV LLC, invested in the Stern entity. That dilutes his stake in the project and his overall investment to nearly $2.2 million, the complaint alleges.\nIt\u2019s unknown how Stern and Vacchi will move forward, especially if the lawsuit continues. A source told\nThe Real Deal\nthat Vacchi\u2019s investments are being bought out by an institutional investor.\nVacchi\u2019s lawsuit cites information from JDSPulse.com, a website that\nStern sued\nthe anonymous operator of last year over allegedly defamatory statements. That complaint, filed last year, claims the unknown website owner orchestrated a smear campaign about Stern and his company. Stern is suing to uncover the identity of the person behind the site.\nVacchi\u2019s complaint also alleges that Stern hid an \u201cextensive history of defrauding his investors\u00a0 forcing them to pursue legal actions like this one just to get their money back.\u201d The complaint dives into previous lawsuits that Stern has been involved in.\n\u201cTo make matters worse, Stern also hid that he had a long history of artificially prolonging those legal battles through abusive and deceptive litigation tactics, which any reasonable investor like GV NBV would have wanted to know when deciding whether to invest with Stern or any entity that he controls,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n",

        "content": "Croke Fairchild Duarte &amp; Beres is bucking the Loop\u2019s office downsizing narrative, inking a larger lease and consolidating its downtown space in a riverfront tower on LaSalle Street.\nThe fast-growing Chicago law firm signed a lease for about 40,000 square feet on the fifth floor of the building at 222 North LaSalle Street, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The move will allow the firm to expand from the roughly 25,000 square feet it currently leases across two offices at the buildings at\n180 North LaSalle Street\nand\n191 North Wacker Drive\n, both of which it plans to vacate.\nThe deal stands out amid record high downtown office vacancy and a steady drumbeat of companies shedding space, as hybrid work settles in. While some large law firms have leaned into that trend, Croke Fairchild is moving in the opposite direction, joining a small but notable group of legal practices that have recently\ntaken bigger offices\n. According to the outlet, Cleveland-based Benesch Friedlander Coplan &amp; Aronoff and Chicago-based Goldman Ismail Tomaselli Brennan &amp; Baum have also expanded their downtown spaces over the past year.\nCroke Fairchild embraced remote work early, using flexibility as a recruiting tool and widening its talent pool, said managing partner and co-founder Drew Beres. But rapid growth changed the math on needed office space. The firm added 25 attorneys last year, bringing its headcount to about 110, and is increasingly running into space constraints when lawyers and staff choose to be in the office at the same time.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve noticed as we\u2019ve given people that freedom and flexibility, it seems like people want to come to the office even more,\u201d Beres told the outlet. \u201cWe wanted to make sure we accommodated that.\u201d\nThe 27-story, roughly 1 million-square-foot building at the southwest corner of LaSalle Street and Wacker Drive is owned by the Chicago-based Crown family and was already 93 percent leased before the deal, according to CoStar data. A spokesperson for the\nHenry Crown\nholding company did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe firm\u2019s departure from the building at 180 North LaSalle will be felt more sharply. The 38-story tower, owned by Montreal-based La Caisse, is about 64 percent leased, well below the downtown average of roughly 72 percent, CoStar data shows, but the building at 180 North LaSalle sits across from the James R. Thompson Center, which Google is redeveloping into its Chicago headquarters, a nearby catalyst that could eventually lift demand.\nFilling space remains challenging: The Loop finished 2025 with a net loss of about 370,000 square feet of tenants compared with 2024, according to CBRE.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Illinois\u2019 real estate trade group is beefing up its lobbying team, bringing in former government staffers to lead a push for housing reforms in Springfield and in Chicago.\nIllinois Realtors said on Monday that it was adding Melia Carter as vice president of governmental affairs. Anne Emerseon and Audrey Harding are joining as local government affairs directors to work with the\nChicago City Council\nand Cook County Board of Commissioners, respectively.\nJeff Baker, CEO of Illinois Realtors, told\nThe Real Deal\nthe group is preparing to push for policies that increase density in Chicago and statewide, while opposing potential\nproperty tax hikes\nand tenant protections it argues would stifle investment.\nThe organization will work on \u201csecuring policies that increase housing inventory, incentivize homebuying and thwart burdensome property tax hikes and regulations,\u201d Baker said in a press release.\nCarter will manage Illinois Realtors\u2019 12-member government affairs team, according to the release. Most recently, she led Verizon\u2019s government affairs team across the Midwest and in Chicago.\nOn the local front, the association is bringing in insiders with deep ties to local governments to lead its lobbying efforts. Emerson, who will be focusing on Chicago, was chief of staff for the City Council\u2019s Finance Committee from 2019 to 2023, according to her LinkedIn. She most recently was senior vice president at Mercury Public Affairs.\nHarding, responsible for Cook County, is coming from a post as senior legislative assistant in Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s intergovernmental affairs office. She has previously worked for the Cook County Board of Commissioners, first in Johnson\u2019s office and later for Commissioner Tara Stamps, according to her LinkedIn.\nThe 2026 agenda\nAt the state level,\nIllinois Realtors is backing five bills Baker called the \u201cHousing Stability &amp; Affordability Initiative.\u201d\nTwo of those bills aim to ease local zoning rules and allow for denser housing, Baker said. One would require cities to allow accessory dwelling units, a measure Chicago officials\nenacted in a limited form last year\n. Another would require larger cities to allow \u201cmiddle housing,\u201d including buildings with up to four units and townhomes, on lots of a certain size zoned for any residential use.\nOther pieces of their state-level platform include a cap on impact fees on new developments, and tax advantages for first-time homebuyers. The group is also pushing a bill that would eliminate \u201ccrime-free\u201d housing ordinances, which landlords and advocates have argued are used to discriminate against tenants based on race.\nIn Chicago, the organization will advocate for upzoning, especially near transit stations and on large lots, Baker said.\nIt will also continue opposing efforts to give tenants the right of first refusal to purchase their buildings, a measure that gained some traction last year and is in effect in some neighborhoods. Real estate groups say the policy makes it more difficult for landlords to sell their property and drives up housing costs.\n\u201cRealtors will also continue to be the largest advocate for property rights, whether that is from even more dramatic real estate taxes or restrictions on rentals that end up hurting tenants or driving homeownership further out of reach,\u201d he said.\nThe City Council passed an ordinance giving tenants in the\nSouth Shore and Woodlawn\nneighborhoods the right of first refusal to buy their buildings last year. Similar measures are in place in some\nNorthwest Side neighborhoods\nlike Logan Square and Avondale.\nBeyond the statehouse and city hall, the association plans to launch \u201chousing supply accelerators\u201d in 2026, Baker said. The program will target specific communities to study local zoning codes and recommend changes to bring down construction costs.\n",

        "content": "San Francisco\u2019s ultra-luxury neighborhoods saw home prices rise to\nnever-before-seen numbers\nlast year.\nPrices in the San Francisco Association of Realtors\u2019 District 7,\ncomprising\nthe neighborhoods of Pacific Heights, Presidio Heights,\nthe Marina and Cow Hollow\n, hit their\nhighest-ever levels\nlast year, the San Francisco Chronicle reported, citing a new\nreport\nfrom Compass.\nThe median sales price for houses in the district rose to $6 million in 2025, up 20 percent from the year prior. That marked the fastest increase among any part of the city recorded by Compass data. Across the city, the median house price was approximately $1.7 million last year.\nThe\nBay Area luxury housing\nsector at large saw an upswing last year as middle-income families have been shut out of the market due to economic uncertainty, high housing prices and less-than-deal mortgage rates, opening the door for wealthier households benefiting from the artificial intelligence boom. In San Francisco specifically, the influx of\nAI workers and executives has driven up demand\nfor upscale homes so much that it has created a\nmansion shortage\nin the city. Bay Area tech workers and investors are likely also doing well from massive gains in the stock market, according to analysts.\n\u201cRight now, the economy is more favorable to wealthy people,\u201d Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin, told the Chronicle. That trend isn\u2019t expected to change in 2026, as this year is expected to bring San Francisco\u2019s hottest housing market since pre-pandemic times, Compass analyst Patrick Carlisle said.\nMost of the other Realtor districts in San Francisco haven\u2019t climbed back up to price peaks seen mid-pandemic when interest rates were at historic lows. Prices in the city, including the seventh Realtor district, fell in 2022 and 2023 as mortgage rate hikes poured cold water on a previously red-hot market.\nSince then, well-positioned buyers began shopping in Pacific Heights and Cow Hollow, often without the need for a loan to buy a house. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty jaw-dropping how many buyers we have coming to us who are all-cash, ready to go,\u201d Michelle Harris, a real estate agent with Compass, said. Homes selling for between $2.5 million and $5 million are being bought in a week or less, Harris said.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Dana Johnson,\none of Houston\u2019s top-ranked agents\n, left\nCompass\nfor Douglas Elliman this month.\nJohnson, whose deals last year included one of\nthe most expensive homes sold in Houston\n, joined Douglas Elliman after six years with Compass, citing Compass\u2019 growth as a reason for her departure.\n\u201cSometimes bigger isn\u2019t always better. I feel like at Douglas Elliman, the brand itself is a luxury brand, and that\u2019s what I sell,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cCompass definitely is a luxury brand, but it\u2019s also really large. So you\u2019re not going to get the support that you need, or that I needed, in a broker.\u201d\nHouston has a narrower luxury market than other Texas metros, Johnson pointed out. That might explain why Houston enjoyed the fastest selling homes in Texas last year; Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth and San Antonio all had higher median days on market in the fall, according to\nRedfin\n. When\nAustin had one of the slowest markets in the country\nin October, with a median 104 days on market for luxury homes, Houston had a median of 52 days on market. Dallas and Fort Worth luxury homes both sold after a median 62 days on market, and San Antonio had a median of 91 days on the market.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have very much inventory. You can\u2019t be real choosy,\u201d Johnson said of luxury buyers. \u201cThere\u2019s a very small niche of where they\u2019re going to be, if they\u2019re going to buy a luxury house in Houston.\u201d\nFive of the city\u2019s top 10 luxury deals last year took place within one square mile in the\nRiver Oaks\nneighborhood. Three of the others were in Memorial Villages.\nHowever, Houston\u2019s luxury market isn\u2019t just geographically tight. It also fields an exceptionally small league of agents compared to\nDallas\nand\nAustin\n\u2014 and Compass leads the group. In Dallas, 18 agents represented the 20 parties in the top 10 deals of 2025. In Austin, another 18 agents also represented the 20 parties in the top 10 sales. In Houston, just 10 agents were spread over the top 10 deals, according to\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s research.\nJohnson represented the buyer of the city\u2019s seventh-\nmost expensive residential sale last year\n, a 10,799-square-foot custom mansion at 11321 Green Vale Drive that was asking $9.8 million. Excluding Johnson\u2019s deal, eight of the top 10 residential sales in Harris County last year involved a Compass agent, usually either Laura Sweeney or Dee Dee Guggenheim Howes.\n\u201cWhen I joined Compass, there [were] a hundred agents. Now [there are] 800. It\u2019s just hard to get the support that you need when there\u2019s that many agents,\u201d Johnson said.\n",

        "content": "Trammell Crow is gearing up for another expansion at one of North Texas\u2019 biggest industrial hubs, filing plans for a new phase of its sprawling 35 Eagle development in far north Fort Worth.\nDallas-based Trammell Crow submitted filings for a fourth phase of the project at 2501 Eagle Parkway, near AllianceTexas, according to records with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat the plans call for three new speculative industrial buildings totaling nearly 750,000 square feet, with individual structures sized at roughly 500,000 square feet, 107,000 square feet and 140,000 square feet. The filings peg construction costs at about $40 million.\nIf the plans move forward as filed, construction would begin in February and wrap up in April 2027. Alliance Architects is listed as the design firm. A\nTrammell Crow\nspokesperson declined to provide additional details, noting only that a formal announcement could come later.\nThe expansion would build on the scale Trammell Crow and its partner,\nPGIM Real Estate\n, have already achieved at\n35 Eagle\n. The industrial park spans nearly 5.9 million square feet along I-35 West, near the Perot Field Fort Worth Alliance Airport and the BNSF Intermodal Center, according to Trammell Crow\u2019s website. The most recent phase included five buildings totaling about 2.1 million square feet, with the developer signaling it would pursue additional phases once that space stabilized.\nRecent activity suggests demand remains. In June, Taiwanese technology manufacturer\nWistron\nbought a 324,598-square-foot building within 35 Eagle from Trammell Crow as part of a broader North Texas push tied to its planned $750 million supercomputer manufacturing investment with Nvidia.\nFar north Fort Worth currently has the largest industrial construction pipeline in the U.S., with about 7.7 million square feet under development across 20 projects, according to CoStar.\nBeyond 35 Eagle, Trammell Crow remains active across the region, with projects underway near DFW International Airport, expansions at Passport Park and the Lake Vista Technology Park in Lewisville.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The final days of the Adams administration were busy. Here\u2019s a change that slipped under the radar.\nUnderstandably, the flurry of mayoral\nvetoes\nalongside last-minute\ndrama\non the Rent Guidelines Board garnered a lot of attention at the end of Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 time in office.\nBut the administration also made some changes to environmental review, potentially making it a little easier for certain housing projects to move forward.\nAs part of updates to the City Environmental Quality Review (CEQR) Technical Manual last month, the administration permitted certain housing projects to complete a shorter Environmental Assessment Statement (EAS), which typically takes six to eight months.\nThis change builds on the Green Fast Track\nadopted\nby the administration in 2024. Under that program, housing projects with fewer than 175 units in low-density districts or 250 units in medium- or high-density districts could avoid environmental review.\nBut projects with site-specific issues (such as those relating to air quality, coastal flooding, noise or hazardous materials) couldn\u2019t qualify. The changes last month allow projects that meet the density threshold under the Green Fast Track, but can\u2019t qualify due to site-specific issues, to complete a shorter EAS.\nThe city\u2019s ability to address environmental review-related delays is limited. More extensive changes require state action. State lawmakers have previously proposed exempting large affordable housing projects from environmental review, which passed in the Senate last year but died in committee in the Assembly.\nBut major change could be on the way. As part of her State of the State address, Gov. Kathy Hochul is expected to propose exempting a majority of housing projects from state environmental review,\nthe Wall Street Journal reports\n. She also wants to set a two-year maximum for projects that must undergo review.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: What other housing-related policies will Hochul prioritize in her State of the State address on Tuesday? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing you\u2019ve learned\n: Nonprofit New Destiny Housing is calling on the state to allocate $62.1 million to New York\u2019s supportive housing program in this year\u2019s budget. Last year\u2019s budget included a $17.8 million increase (40 percent) in funding for the New York State Supportive Housing Program, representing the largest investment in 40 years. In a statement, the nonprofit indicated that the governor needs to build on this investment in this year\u2019s budget.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Mayor Zohran Mamdani and his wife, Rama Duwaji, have moved into Gracie Mansion,\nthe New York Times reports\n.\n\u2014 Roughly 15,000 nurses walked out of city hospitals on Monday after their union, the New York State Nurses Association, and several major hospital systems failed to reach an agreement over staffing levels, benefits and other issues,\nAssociated Press reports\n. The hospitals remain open and have hired temporary nurses during the strike.\n\u2014 Mamdani on Monday named Rafael Espinal, who formerly served on the City Council and the state Assembly, as the new commissioner of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Media and Entertainment.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$24.5 million\nfor a condominium unit at 730 Fifth Avenue. The Midtown condo is 3,700 square feet.\nThe Corcoran Group\u2019s\nConnor Cuccinelli and Noble Black have the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$53 million\nfor 63 Crosby Street. The Soho landmark building is 32,400 square feet. Office investment company Vertex purchased the five-story building,\nper reports\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $13.9 million for 25 East 94th Street. The Upper East Side townhouse is 8,200 square feet.\nCompass\u2019\nThe Doyle Team has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 21,386-square-foot, eight-story residential building at 651 Myrtle Avenue in Bedford Stuyvesant. S. Wieder Architect is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "Newsday managed to publish an\nentire article\nabout the conversion of the JFK Hilton into affordable housing without naming the developers, Slate Property Group and RiseBoro Community Partnership.\nYou might ask, What\u2019s the big deal? But think about it. Would a daily newspaper run a story about a New York basketball team winning a playoff series without mentioning the Knicks?\nFor better or worse, it\u2019s pretty common for mainstream publications to cover development without paying much or any attention to the developers. If they are included at all, it\u2019s usually near the end of the piece.\nIn this case, Newsday gave full credit to the Hochul administration for the conversion of the hotel into apartments. Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s own\npress release\nat least cited the developers, but not until the sixth paragraph.\nFrom reading it, you\u2019d think she converted the hotel herself.\n\u201cGovernor Kathy Hochul today announced completion of Baisley Pond Park Residences, a 318-unit, $167 million affordable housing development in South Jamaica, Queens,\u201d it began.\n\u201cBy transforming a long-vacant hotel into hundreds of affordable homes,\u201d Hochul said in the second paragraph, \u201cwe\u2019re delivering real results for low-income and formerly homeless New Yorkers while making smarter use of existing buildings.\u201d\nThe project did get 29 percent of its funding \u2014 $48 million \u2014 from the state\u2019s HONDA fund, which Hochul helped to create. But, reality check: This is a private project by for-profit and nonprofit developers. It is not a state project.\nBefore we even give Hochul 29 percent of the credit, consider that HONDA, which stands for the\nHousing Our Neighbors with Dignity Act\n, has proven very difficult for projects to use, as\nThe Real Deal\nexplained in a much more\ninformative story\nabout the Slate/RiseBoro project.\nTo be clear, I am not criticizing the governor. Her press office got her good publicity, which is what a press office is supposed to do. It also brought attention to a worthy project that might not have happened without the HONDA legislation.\nNor have I ever heard a developer complain about not being mentioned prominently in coverage by a general interest publication. Usually they are happy to stay under the media\u2019s radar because they are accustomed to being hammered.\nWhatever project they propose is criticized as:\nfor people who are too rich (billionaires! gentrifiers!) or too poor (homeless people! crime!)\nhaving too many bedrooms (children will flood local schools!) or not enough bedrooms (families need housing!)\ntoo far from the subway (traffic! parking!) or too close to the subway (crowded platforms and trains!)\nToo profitable (pure greed!) or too risky (that will never work \u2014 you should abandon it!)\nSlate and RiseBoro probably chuckled at being omitted from Newsday\u2019s piece but were surely glad to yield the spotlight to the governor. They know politicians\u2019 currency is praise and publicity. Developers\u2019 currency is permits and profits.\n",

Luther King added 5,000 more acres in the\nHill Country\nto his family\u2019s expansive holdings.\nThe King family acquired a 5,067-acre tract in McCulloch County dubbed the San Saba River Ranch, marking the first change in family ownership for the property since 1898. The centerpiece of the property is a mile-long stretch of the San Saba, which flows year-round. A dam on the property creates a 6-acre reservoir. Two other tributaries of the San Saba River also cross the property, which is about an hour from San Angelo.\nThe seller cleared much of the underbrush from the land, leaving scenic hardwoods and encouraging game population growth. The property also includes a four-bedroom, four-bathroom stone house and a skeet shooting range, according to the listing.\nThe sale price hasn\u2019t been disclosed, but the property was listed for $22.8 million, or $4,500 per acre. The Haynes Team with Triangle Realty co-listed the property with Dullnig Ranch Sales.\nWhile the market for land is subject to the same\nlull affecting Texas luxury homes\nafter the hot streak of 2021 and 2022,\nlive water\nand optimal game conditions continue to generate demand, according to Dullnig Ranch Sales owner Robert Dullnig.\n\u201c\nProximity to metropolitan areas\ndrives a lot of it, so when you get into some areas that are over two hours away, and you don\u2019t have the live water or the big whitetail, those properties are probably taking a little longer to sell,\u201d Dullnig said.\nKing founded Luther King Capital Management Corporation, a Dallas-based investment advisory firm. He and his family own more than 100,000 acres across six Texas counties, including the 4K Livermore in the Davis Mountains and the 4K Brady Creek Ranch.\nThe Kings are about 200,000 acres away from the\ntop 10 list of the largest landowners in Texas\n. The list is topped by the Texas Pacific Land Corporation, the legacy company of the Texas and Pacific Railway. The list ends with commodities broker Mike Smith, who owns 323,000 acres.\n",

        "content": "Days after the Summit Properties\nwon a bankruptcy auction\nfor 5,200 mostly rent-stabilized apartments from Pinnacle Group, the city has filed a formal objection to the sale.\nLawyers for Mayor Zohran Mamdani\u2019s office asked a judge to stop the transaction, raising questions about insider dealing and saying that Summit has failed to show the ability to fix up the properties. It\u2019s\nthe second time\nthe Mamdani administration has objected to the bankruptcy proceedings.\nThe objection is a last-ditch attempt by the Mamdani administration to throw its might behind tenants at the Pinnacle properties. A confirmation hearing for the sale is scheduled for Thursday.\n\u201cOur north stars in these proceedings have always been improving the habitability of the buildings in this portfolio and protecting their rent-stabilized status,\u201d said Leila Bozorg, deputy mayor for housing, in a statement. \u201cAny sale of the Pinnacle portfolio, whether to Summit Gold, Inc. or another bidder, must lead to improved conditions for tenants.\u201d\nThe city argued in its objection that the sale deserves higher scrutiny because of the possibility of insider involvement. That appears to be an oblique reference to a Bisnow report last week that revealed\nJonathan Wiener, brother of Pinnacle head Joel Wiener\n, signed several deeds for properties that Summit claims to own. A declaration from the state attorney general\u2019s office supporting the city\u2019s effort detailed the connections between Summit and Jonathan Wiener. Summit has denied that Jonathan Wiener had any involvement in the sale.\nThe city previously said it has yet to see evidence that Summit has the\nwillingness and ability to fix housing code violations at the properties\n, arguing in court that the legal rents in the units were too low for Summit to both fix the units and profit from the sale.\nThe objection also referenced housing code violations at Summit\u2019s existing properties, which a declaration by the attorney general\u2019s office places around 4,000 open violations in a current portfolio of 3,000 units.\n\u201cThe City submits that Summit must demonstrate that it has the resources, and moreover, the willingness and intent to cure the violations within the time period required by law and, if necessary, rehabilitate the Properties, while remaining financially sustainable,\u201d the objection reads.\nThe state attorney general\u2019s office argued that the city should be given time to come up with another buyer who would take better care of the buildings, or is at least owed a deeper explanation from Summit about its management plan.\nA spokesperson for Summit did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the objection but the company has said it intends to invest in the portfolio, maintain affordability and hire new management firms.\n\u201cSummit has sufficient resources and capital to honor and perform all obligations under the existing resident leases and comply with all regulatory obligations,\u201d it said in a statement to the court. \u201cSummit also is committed to a long-term housing investment and maintaining the quality and affordability of apartments in its portfolio of Pinnacle properties.\u201d\nThe city also objected to the auction before it took place, hoping for a 30-day delay. But the judge\nthrew out that effort\nlast week.\n",

        "content": "Matthew Whitman Lazenby, whose family has owned Bal Harbour Shops since its inception 61 years ago, is in a dog fight with estranged wife, Kristin Lazenby.\nMatthew\nis trying to block Kristin from gaining access to Bal Harbour Shops\u2019 financial records, and he\u2019s seeking a court order to remove a foster dog she adopted from their home in Asheville, North Carolina. Those are the latest salvos in the couple\u2019s bitter divorce proceedings that began more than a year ago, court records show.\nKristin wants bank statements, canceled checks and general ledgers for Whitman Family Development, the entity that owns Bal Harbour Shops at 9700 Collins Avenue. She wants Matthew\u2019s general partnership stake in the luxury mall to be considered a marital asset.\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that the Bal Harbour Shops have been thrust into the Lazenbys\u2019 divorce proceedings which were intended to be a private matter,\u201d Matthew\u2019s attorney Kathyrn Hamilton said in an email statement. \u201cMr. Lazenby\u2019s personal involvement in this multi-generational family business predates their marriage.\u201d\nKristin\u2019s lawyer Paul Leinoff did not respond to requests for comment.\nBal Harbour Shops traces its origins to the late developer\nStanley Whitman\n, who in 1957 acquired a former World War II army barracks site in the village of Bal Harbour. He created an open-air shopping center featuring designer brands in a tropical garden setting, opening Bal Harbour Shops in 1965. Whitman, who died in 2017, was Matthew\u2019s grandfather.\nBal Harbour Shops features landscaped, breezy walkways lined with retailers such as Balenciaga, Balmain, Bvlgari, Chanel, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Ferragamo and Prada, as well as department stores Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue.\nWhitman Family Development is renovating and expanding Bal Harbour Shops by 200,000 square feet, securing a\n$550 million\nloan in 2019 for the project. The mall owner landed a\n$740 million\nrefinancing in 2024.\nTussle over Bal Harbour Shops data\nMatthew is Bal Harbour Shops\u2019 CEO and the operating general partner for Whitman Family Development, whose chairman is Randall Whitman, Matthew\u2019s uncle. Matthew joined the family business in 2003 and rose to his current position a decade later, according to Bal Harbour Shops\u2019 website.\nHe married Kristin in 2009, and they have three children, court records show. She filed for divorce on in July 2024, alleging the marriage is \u201cirretrievably broken.\u201d\nShe is seeking alimony, attorney fees and an equitable distribution of marital assets, which includes three homes, in Bal Harbour, Santa Rosa Beach and Asheville, where she lives with the three kids, her divorce petition states.\nThe couple has duked it out in court motions in recent months. At an October hearing over her demands to see Whitman Family Development\u2019s books, Philip Schecter, a forensic accountant hired by Kristin\u2019s legal team, testified that he needs to know if Matthew is signing a majority of the checks and payments for\nWhitman Family Development\nto determine if Matthew has an \u201cactive participation in the entity.\u201d\nKristin contends in her filings that Matthew\u2019s general partnership stake in Whitman Family Development could be considered a marital asset. Schecter explained that if Matthew is \u201csigning hundreds of checks over a 12-year period\u201d for Whitman Family Development that would show he\u2019s the chief decision maker, as well as determine whether Matthew has paid himself any profit disbursements from the company.\nLeinoff, Kristin\u2019s attorney, told Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Christine Bandin, who is presiding over the case, that Matthew acquired his general partnership interest during the marriage.\nLeinoff said during the hearing that he needed the information to identify what the marital interest is and what the value is, prior to conducting depositions.\nHamilton, Matthew\u2019s attorney, pushed back. She noted Whitman Family Development was formed by Stanley Whitman and his brothers, and that Kristin had not provided proof that \u201cmarital funds\u201d were used to acquire an interest in the company.\nFoster dog caught in the fray\nAs Matthew tangles with Kristin over Bal Harbour Shops\u2019 financial records, he is also seeking to kick out a recent pet addition to their Asheville household. According to a motion filed the same day as the October hearing, Matthew claimed Kristin \u201cunilaterally fostered [a dog] on a temporary basis without the husband\u2019s knowledge or consent, and the wife had the audacity to \u2018double down\u2019 and has now informed the Husband that she has adopted the dog.\u201d\nMatthew alleges the dog killed Lewey and Dewey, the family\u2019s pet birds, and destroyed furniture and personal property inside the Asheville property. His estranged wife also allegedly let the foster and their two other dogs have free rein in the house.\nMatthew lives in Florida 51 percent of the year, splitting his time between the couple\u2019s homes in Bal Harbour and Santa Rosa Beach, according to court filings.\n\u201cThe most recent catastrophe caused by the wife has resulted in the expensive Ipe hardwood flooring in the mudroom being destroyed,\u201d the motion alleges. \u201cThis happened because the wife deliberately left the dog door closed, thereby preventing the family dogs from going outside to go potty.\u201d\nWhen Matthew returned home, he found \u201ca minefield of dried-up excrement everywhere, including all over the floors, the walls, and the doors,\u201d the motion states. \u201cThe wife undoubtedly left this mess to sink into the flooring overnight because she did not want to bother cleaning it, requiring the husband to spend over an hour to clean it up himself.\u201d\nMatthew wants a court order to boot the foster dog or to give Matthew sole, exclusive use of the Asheville house. In a response filed in November, Kristin accused Matthew of violating a May 2025 agreement to settle some of their temporary conflicts, including allowing both of them to stay in the Asheville house. During a deposition, Matthew confirmed that he\u2019s \u201cnow seeking the wife\u2019s removal from her home,\u201d Kristin\u2019s motion states.\nA hearing on the dog and the house is set for April.",

        "content": "In 2025, Dallas\u2019 office market planted seeds. Industry experts intend to watch them grow this year.\nThe office market is finding its footing in the post-pandemic new normal, logging positive annual absorption of office space for the first time since 2019, according to JLL\u2019s fourth quarter report. Last year wrapped up with 1.3 million square feet of positive absorption \u2014 a marked improvement from 2024 when the market saw its first quarter of positive absorption in the fourth quarter, but still ended the year with nearly 1.5 million square feet of negative absorption.\nNormalizing conditions have two trends to thank. First, return to work mandates from major employers like AT&amp;T, Toyota and JP Morgan gave the market a boost. Second, the development pipeline shrank, reaching its lowest level since 2012.\nFor better or for worse, part of the market\u2019s new normal is its stubborn vacancy rate. The market may be settling in, but it\u2019s still carrying around a lot of dead weight. At the end of the fourth quarter, Dallas-Fort Worth\u2019s vacancy rate was 27.2 percent, a slight tick up from the same period of the year before when vacancy was 27.1 percent, according to JLL.\nOffice trades return\nDallas\u2019 sales volume has bounced back, in another example of office market normalization. Buyers returned to the market in 2025, and the year was robust for office trades, which reached levels not seen since 2022.\nIn 2024, almost all of the\nmarket\u2019s largest office trades\nwere scattered around the Dallas-Fort Worth suburbs. The list included distress buys and office/industrial flex properties.\nLast year, investors got excited about Y\u2019all Street and opened their wallets for Uptown trophies. Cousins Properties kicked off the Uptown spree in July with its\npurchase of The Link at Uptown\nfor $281 million, or a whopping $747 per square foot.\nCrescent Real Estate topped that trade in September when it picked up\nTexas Capital Center,\nat 2000 McKinney Street. German investor Union Investment Real Estate sold the 457,000-square-foot property built in 2008 for an undisclosed price, but said in a release that the sale represented \u201ca significant value increase.\u201d The firm bought the building for $226 million, or $500 per square foot in 2016.\nExperts predict 2026 will build on these wins: \u201cCapital is back and ready to be deployed,\u201d JLL wrote.\nElephant in the room\nIt\u2019s not all sunshine and rainbows for the Dallas office market heading into the new year.\nA blemish on the market, the\nsorry state of Downtown Dallas\n, is starting to look more like a wound.\nAT&amp;T dropped a bomb\non the\nstruggling urban core\nwhen it announced last week that it plans to leave its 2 million-square-foot downtown office space for a new 54-acre campus in Plano.\nAT&amp;T\u2019s chunk of the office market makes up almost 6 percent of the submarket\u2019s total space, and its upcoming exit \u2014 which could happen as soon as 2028 \u2014 is sure to push the area\u2019s elevated vacancy rate even higher. The central business district has a vacancy rate of about 33 percent, according to Partners Real Estate.\nThe submarket suffered another blow when Todd Interests\u2019 Shawn Todd announced\nhe\u2019s handing back the keys to The National\n, the skyscraper he spent $460 million converting into a mixed-use project. Starwood Capital Group is foreclosing on the property after providing a $230 million refinancing in 2023.\nThe building at 1401 Elm Street is one of the largest office conversion projects in the country, a poster child for adaptive reuse as a method of breathing new life into crumbling downtown office districts. Todd secured $150 million in state and local incentives to complete the ambitious project, which opened in 2020.\n",

The deal for the five-story, 80,000-square-foot building breaks down to $888 per square foot.\nBritish real estate firm Epic sold the property, which is also known as 15 Little West 12th Street. The company purchased the property for $69 million in 2011, suggesting there was not much profit to be had for the boutique office and retail building, which was developed by Taconic Investment Partners and Square Mile Capital Management.\nTenants include Red Bull, energy company Kimmeridge and the Match Group, parent company of dating services Tinder and Hinge. The estimated rent for office space at the property ranges from $82 to $100 per square foot, according to CoStar.\nTPG and Aurora did not respond to requests for comment on the deal.\nAurora is already one of the largest owners in the neighborhood, ranking up there with William Gottlieb Real Estate. This may be TPG\u2019s first foray into the Meatpacking District, though.\nBobby Cayre founded Aurora in 2001, focused on \u201chigh street\u201d retail. It has since expanded out into developing ground-up boutique office and retail projects, as well as the occasional residential. In August, the company made news when Aurora snagged a signed contract for a penthouse at 140 Jane Street\nasking $87.5 million\n.\nTPG just made a massive deal of its own to start the year,\nbuying a majority stake\nin Lennar\u2019s multifamily arm, Quarterra. TPG Real Estate plans to invest $1 billion in the business and could raise additional capital for growth; Quarterra has built 43,000 apartments across the country since 2011 and has another 13,000 in the pipeline.\nElsewhere in the Meatpacking District, Bilt recently\nsigned a 58,000-square-foot lease\nto take over Samsung\u2019s former office at 837 Washington Street.\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Real estate plays a major role in this year\u2019s Florida legislative session.\nLawmakers will take up proposals this session that would streamline approvals for rural master-planned communities, tweak the controversial Live Local Act, and target homeowners associations. Also up for votes are numerous proposals for property tax alleviation for homeowners who receive a homestead exemption.\nThe session starts today. Here\u2019s what\u2019s on tap for real estate:\nLive Local tweaks\nSen. Alexis Calatayud, a Republican representing a portion of Miami-Dade County, proposed an expansion of the Live Local Act, a workforce housing law that\u2019s riled some counties and municipalities since it was approved in 2023.\nLive Local allows developers to bypass local zoning regulations and public meetings if they designate 40 percent of the units in their projects for households earning up to 120 percent of the area median income.\nThey can obtain approvals administratively and build up to the tallest height permitted within a mile and the highest density allowed in a jurisdiction. It also grants developers property tax exemptions.\nSouth Florida developers have seized on the legislation with a flurry of applications, while some municipalities have decried the Live Local Act for curtailing their say over development. The law has been especially\ncontentious\nin the tri-county region\u2019s\nsmall coastal communities\nthat have maintained strict development regulations and\nfought back large projects\n.\nCalatayud\u2019s\nSenate Bill 1548\nwould expand Live Local to include properties owned by counties, municipalities and schools districts, and it would curb localities\u2019 ability to restrict height via setbacks and stepbacks. The proposal would clarify that farms and farm operations aren\u2019t commercial properties and don\u2019t qualify for Live Local projects.\nAffordability\nLegislators also want to extend the affordability requirement under the Live Local Act.\nUnder the law, the below-market units have to remain as such for at least 30 years.\nHouse Bill 675\n/\nSenate Bill 756\naim to increase this to 50 years.\nIt would also tighten the affordability requirements for developers to get tax abatements. The law allows landlords to obtain a 75 percent property tax break for all units designated for households earning from 80 percent to 120 percent of the AMI. The bills would drop the upper thresholds to 100 percent of the AMI.\nPost-hurricane rebuilding\nLast year, the legislature approved SB 180, titled \u201cEmergencies,\u201d part of which banned local governments from imposing comprehensive plan amendments, land development regulations and site plan approval procedures that could be deemed \u201cmore restrictive or burdensome.\u201d The law applies to counties and municipalities included in federal disaster declarations within 100 miles of a hurricane\u2019s track.\nIt\u2019s meant to remove roadblocks to rebuilding after three hurricanes hit the state in 2024, imposing the restrictions through 2027. For all future hurricanes, the law restricts tighter development regulations for a year.\nBut the controversial proposal riled some local governments that argued it further erodes \u201chome rule\u201d authority over development regulations and potentially opens the door to developers invoking SB 180 over any local zoning change that stands in the way of proposed projects. Several South Florida municipalities joined as plaintiffs in a\nlawsuit\nlast year against SB 180, including Bal Harbour, Fort Lauderdale, Homestead and Palm Beach.\nSen. Nick DiCeglie, a Republican from St. Petersburg, filed\nSenate Bill 840\n, partly curbing the previous legislation.\nThis proposal would hand more control back to counties and cities over development rules, rolling back previously imposed limits.\nIt would roll back the temporary ban on local regulations tied to 2024\u2019s hurricanes until this year. For future storms, it would limit the one-year ban on zoning changes to damaged properties only.\nIt also would narrow the scope of SB 180 to cities and municipalities within 50 miles of a hurricane\u2019s track, while allowing localities to enforce a reconstruction moratorium if it\u2019s to address stormwater, flood management and potable water supply, or sewer repairs.\nRural homebuilding\nLandowners of at least 10,000 acres could bypass county and municipal zoning and other regulations under\nSenate Bill 354\n/\nHouse Bill 299\n, as long as they meet certain development conditions, including the creation of affordable housing.\nCreating \u201cBlue Ribbon Projects,\u201d the proposals add to initiatives that stirred controversy over their potential erosion of local governments\u2019 say over growth and development, and concerns over suburban sprawl.\nUnder the proposals, 60 percent of the land must be reserved for environmental conservation, wildlife corridors, agriculture or other open spaces, and the rest can be developed with up to 12 units per acre. At least 20 percent of residential units must be affordable, workforce housing, or homes for people who qualify under the Florida Hometown Hero Program, including teachers and police.\nQualifying projects can be approved administratively, allowing them to bypass public hearings.\nRep. Lauren Melo, a Naples Republican, and Sen. Stan McClain, a Republican representing Ocala, sponsored the bills.\nNew York-based investment manager Ruane Cunniff, which has amassed roughly 80,000 acres in north Florida counties since 2017, is backing the bills through an affiliate, including hiring lobbyists pushing for the legislation, independent investigative journalist Jason Garcia\nreported\n. Ruane Cunniff has paid at least $230 million for land in rural areas.\nTax breaks\nAfter Gov. Ron DeSantis floated the idea last year of eliminating property taxes for homesteaded residences, lawmakers put forth\noptions\nto achieve it this session.\nThe move would require\nconstitutional amendments\nand approval from Florida voters in November.\nThe resolutions would exempt property taxes funding school districts and mandate that county and municipal budgets for law enforcement should not be reduced.\nHouse joint resolution 201\n, filed by Republican Rep. Monique Miller of\u00a0 Palm Bay, would eliminate all non-school property taxes for homes. Miller\u2019s\njoint resolution 203\nproposes to increase the value of homestead exemptions by $100,000 each year for 10 years starting in 2027, phasing out property taxes by 2037.\nHJR 205\n, filed by Republican Rep. Juan Carlos Porras, who represents part of Miami-Dade County, would eliminate property taxes for homeowners who are 65 and older.\nRep. DeFuniak Springs, a Republican representing a portion of the Panhandle, filed\nHJR 207\n, proposing to add homestead exemptions for 25 percent of the home\u2019s assessed value after all other exemptions are applied.\nLocal governments, including Orlando and Orange County, have warned the proposals could hit\nbudgets\nfor parks, infrastructure maintenance and improvements, fire departments and other services.\nHOAs\nPorras is going after homeowners associations this session.\nResidents living in HOAs across the state have accused some board members of wrongdoing including election interference, misappropriation of funds, unjustified assessment increases, and bullying and retaliation against those who speak out.\nThe most extreme case was at the\nHammocks\nin West Kendall, South Florida\u2019s largest HOA on 3,800 acres and with 18,000 residents.\nPorras, the majority of whose district consists of the Hammocks, proposed legislation that would allow residents to disband their HOAs. But attorneys say it\nwon\u2019t work\n.\nUnder\nHouse Bill 657\n, residents could start the dismantling process with a petition signed by 20 percent of homeowners, which the board must vote on at a meeting and also set the termination rules, requiring approval by two-thirds of homeowners. The plan of termination would be filed in court, and a termination trustee, such as the board or someone appointed, would oversee the dismantling of the HOA, including the sale of assets.\nExperts in HOA law said this would be difficult, because HOAs own infrastructure such as stormwater and sewer systems, landscaping and roads, and not just sellable assets such as maintenance equipment.\n\u201cYou may be dissolving the actual corporation, but how are you going to split up the assets?\u201d said attorney Carolina Sznajderman Sheir. \u201cWho is going to take responsibility for maintaining the roadways [and other infrastructure]? Who is going to be responsible for operating, maintaining and insuring this?\u201d\nCounties and municipalities would be reluctant to assume responsibility for this infrastructure partly because it could mean increasing taxes to maintain common areas that only HOA residents use, attorneys said.\nHB 657 has other provisions, some of which attorneys hailed. It would create a Community Association Court, alleviating the backlog of HOA and condo association cases at circuit courts.",

        "content": "Investor\nAlon Abady\nhas made his latest real estate play, this time in the form of a 300,000-square-foot\noffice campus\ndonation to West Coast Chabad.\nThe 16-story office building in Pico-Robertson, with a 1,200-vehicle parking facility, sits on an acre and a half at 9911 West Pico Boulevard and was recently appraised for $103 million, according to Abady. He and his wife Monique made the donation in honor of Alon\u2019s mother, Liora Abady.\n\u201cWhen we moved to the States in the late 70s, we had nothing,\u201d said Alon, whose mother found a job with Chabad after the family immigrated to Los Angeles. \u201cThey were there for us when we first came here and that carried a personal weight.\u201d\nAbady, who is managing partner of Waterfall Bridge Capital, paid Blackstone $35 million, or about $140 per square foot, for the property in 2023 with plans to redevelop it. That could still happen with the property holding by-right entitlements, which holds the door open for a possible residential conversion.\nHowever, plans in the near future call for the building to serve as the Chabad Campus for Jewish Life, which will encompass a synagogue, educational facilities, mental and social services, a banquet and events hall and the Abady Family Center once fully operational.\nAbady described the building as \u201cspecial\u201d and an \u201ciconic LA property,\u201d sitting between Culver City and Beverly Hills. Fox Studios is located next door, while Hillcrest Country Club sits opposite the property. In a sea of mostly low-rise commercial or multifamily structures, 9911 Pico Boulevard can be seen driving from the east or west.\nAbady\u2019s latest deal, which closed on Friday, is different from some of the other trades tied to his name within the local marketplace.\nThe investor is best known for his $96 million purchase of the Sofitel Hotel in Beverly Hills in 2021, but his name is also known in high-end residential real estate.\nThat portfolio includes the 2020, $25 million purchase of\nSimon Cowell\n\u2019s former home at 717 North Palm Drive in Beverly Hills, which Abady flipped for $34 million three years later. Also in 2023, Abady sold a property in the gated Madison Club community of La Quinta to Justin and Hailey Bieber for $16.6 million. More recently, in 2024, he paid $17 million for 1357 Laurel Way, which was previously owned by conservationists\nDan and Susan Gottlieb\n.\n",

        "content": "A newly built home in\nManhattan Beach\n\u2019s Hill Section neighborhood found a buyer last week to make for Los Angeles County\u2019s top residential property to go into contract.\nBuilt in the trendy modern farmhouse style, the six-bed, eight-bath home of more than 6,000 square feet was asking $8.8 million, or $1,424 per square foot.\nThe property appeared in the\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n, which ranks signed contracts based on asking price. Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team compiles the weekly report, which uses Multiple Listing Service data and an asking price floor of $4 million.\nIf the deal on 711 North Dianthus Street closes, the buyer will walk away with a discount from the original ask of $9.3 million, when the home first hit the market in March.\nProperty records show an entity called BM Investments scooped up the home in 2022 for $2.6 million, with state filings tying the limited liability company to real estate investor Bedros Najarian and the Hawthorne address of a company called Doon Builders.\nThe listing is held by Thompson Team Real Estate\u2019s Joseph Nuzzolo.\nThe property\u2019s location in the Hill Section places it in the same neighborhood as Los Angeles Lakers point guard\nLuka Don\u010di\u0107\n.\nAlthough, the home Don\u010di\u0107 paid for last August amounted to $25 million for what was previously tennis star Maria Sharapova\u2019s former pad. That off-market closing edged past the $24.5 million sale of\n1800 The Strand\nas Manhattan Beach\u2019s priciest residential sale on record.\nLast week\u2019s next priciest listing to fall into contract, according to the Eklund Gomes report, was 2311 Worthing Lane, located in the Bel Air Crest community.\nDesigned as an East Coast traditional-style home, the property is listed for just under $8 million, or $864 per square foot.\nIt counts five beds and 7 baths across 9,200 square feet, with the listing held by the Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Lea Porter.\nThe home first hit the market in September asking nearly $9 million before seeing a price reduction the following month.\nProperty records and listing sites show the home last sold in 2011 for $3.2 million and is currently owned by a trust tied to Brian and Mira Lee. Brian is a serial entrepreneur, who co-founded LegalZoom, ShoeDazzle and Honest Co.\nAcross Los Angeles County, signed contract activity last week shook out to be about on par with the year-ago period. A total of 13 homes went into contract, equating to about $77 million in asking volume, according to the Eklund Gomes report.\n",

But Steven Roth was able to hold onto the building.\nVornado is free of\nspecial servicing\nat the Plaza District office building after fulfilling its obligations on the $800 million mortgage backing the property, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The loan is considered current and ownership prefunded shortfalls for the next 12 months, as well as a $1.5 million leasing reserve, according to Morningstar Credit Analytics.\nNo modification was made to the mortgage, which matures in three years. Ownership also dodged a workout fee from the special servicer.\nIt\u2019s an abrupt improvement of fortunes for an ownership group that also includes Oxford Properties Group and the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, none of whom commented on the latest development.\nThe debt behind the Class A office building was sent to special servicing in October after the borrower failed to meet payment obligations. A month later, a Piper Sandler analyst predicted the building\u2019s lenders would soon take possession of the property and work on a quick sale.\nOwnership secured a $214 million refinancing for the property in 2019. But revenue and occupancy quickly fell off.\nOccupancy was 97 percent when the loan was issued, but Ralph Lauren \u2014 which once leased over 40 percent of the space in the building \u2014\ndownsized\nby 39 percent and is\npaying\nabout 30 percent less in rent.\nOccupancy dropped to 57 percent in 2024, according to Morningstar, but is all the way back up to 98 percent, per CoStar. Office tenants include Lakewood Capital, while retail space is occupied by Celine, Moncler, Balmain, Cremieux, Tod\u2019s and others.\nAt its most recent appraisal, the property saw its value fall; once estimated to be worth $1.21 billion, 650 Madison was appraised at $950 million.\nThe 28-story office and retail building totals 595,000 square feet. It was purchased by Vornado, Oxford and the pension fund in 2013 for roughly $1.3 billion.\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A long-gestating South Side Chicago megadevelopment spearheaded by leadership of the Apostolic Church of God is moving closer to reality, with its first phase set to face city zoning and planning officials this month.\nDeveloper J. Byron Brazier, son of longtime Apostolic Church pastor Byron Brazier, applied for a zoning change for the initial phase of Woodlawn Central, an 8-acre, church-controlled \u201ccultural\u201d complex planned along the 63rd Street corridor, Block Club Chicago\nreported\n. The application would amend a planned development designation originally approved for the site two decades ago.\nThe\nfirst phase\ntargets an Apostolic Church parking lot bounded by 63rd and 64th streets, Dorchester Avenue and the Metra Electric tracks. Plans call for two buildings rising from a block-long podium, with a 14-story, roughly 160-foot-tall structure with 231 apartments units, a hotel, 23,000 square feet of retail and another 3,500 square feet of commercial space.\nThe\nbase\nwould house retail and residential and hotel lobbies on the ground floor, with parking decks on the second and third floors. The buildings above would hold the apartments and hotel rooms. The project would include 300 parking spaces for cars and 260 bicycle spots, a notable ratio for a transit-adjacent site near the 63rd Street Metra station.\nAs required under the city\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance, 20 percent of the units would be set aside for households earning up to 60 percent of area median income, which equates to $71,940 for a family of four. Brazier framed the project as an economic development play as much as a housing one, emphasizing jobs, workforce pipelines and income growth as tools to attract market-rate investment without displacement.\nIf introduced as planned at the Jan. 21 Chicago City Council meeting, the proposal would still need approval from the plan commission, the zoning committee and the full council.\nWoodlawn Central\nwas first unveiled in 2021 as a sweeping, multiyear vision for church-owned parcels nearby. At full buildout, the project is expected to include about 870 housing units across workforce, market-rate, luxury and senior categories, along with roughly 215,000 square feet of office and retail space. Later phases include a performance venue, a district-scale energy facility, a vertical greenhouse and renovations to the historic headhouse at the 63rd Street Metra Electric station.\nThe zoning push lands amid a broader development wave in Woodlawn tied to the Obama Presidential Center, slated to open in June. City Council last fall approved a separate\n26-story hotel\na few blocks east at 6402 South Stony Island Avenue, backed by Aquinnah Investment Trust, led by Allison Davis, a onetime boss of Barack Obama.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Investors burned in a nearly $120 million Bay Area real estate fraud scheme\nmay not recover\nall their losses through condominium unit sales by a receiver at 1853 Almaden Road in San Jose and 42111 Osgood Road in Fremont, the Mercury News reported.\nThe case is tied to South Bay real estate executive\nSanjeev Acharya\nand his company\nSilicon Sage Builders\n. In 2020, federal investigators charged Acharya with defrauding hundreds of investors out of $119 million that they had invested in an unknown number of projects by Acharya and Silicon Sage across the Bay Area. Authorities claimed Acharya and Silicon Sage, like fellow\nembattled Bay Area developer Ken Mattson\n, would shift money around from investors to various bank accounts to keep cash flows active. Silicon Sage and Acharya had 77 different bank accounts in total and made at least 130,000 banking transactions over a period of eight years.\nAcharya was caught when authorities homed in on the activities of seven entities that Acharya and his company controlled. \u201cThe transactions that the receiver\u2019s forensic accountant analyzed consistently demonstrated that money put into a specific entity would be transferred through multiple accounts, usually within a matter of minutes, before ending up in the account of an entity that needed to make payments that day,\u201d the receiver said in a U.S. District Court filing on Dec. 3. He settled his case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange commission in 2021.\nA court-appointed receiver hired Acres Loan Origination, the senior construction lender for the 96-unit Almaden Road complex in\nSan Jose\nand the 91-unit Osgood Road development in Fremont, to complete the projects. The money earned from these condo unit sales was supposed to go to investors and other creditors who lost money in Acharya\u2019s web of alleged fraud, but the effort soon hit a snag.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the cost to complete the projects exceeded the original estimates and took longer than anticipated,\u201d Kyra Andrassy, a legal counsel for the receiver, said in legal documents. The attorney cited \u201ceconomic repercussions of the pandemic and supply chain issues,\u201d in addition to the failure of Acharya and Silicon Sage Builders as professional developers, as hurdles that proved difficult to overcome.\n\u201cMuch of the work that had been completed prior to the receiver\u2019s appointment needed to be redone or repaired because of shoddy workmanship,\u201d the receiver told the court.\nThe Osgood development in Fremont was completed in early 2024 and had sold all of its units by June of that year. Acres received $62.7 million from the sale of the condos in that building. In San Jose, the Almaden project was completed in late 2024, but sales have been slower than anticipated. As of early last month, 45 condos had been sold, while another 12 were in escrow and the other 39 were still available for sale. Acres has received $28.8 million in proceeds from that project so far.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Gov. Kathy Hochul wants to make it easier to build in New York, while also cracking down on bad landlords and cutting down on property owner costs.\nIn her fifth State of the State address, Hochul will unveil her \u201cLet Them Build\u201d agenda, which includes speeding up housing and infrastructure projects. She will also back\nefforts\nto create new criminal charges for landlords that repeatedly harass tenants across their portfolios.\nHochul\u2019s agenda echoes the\nearly approach\nof Mayor Zohran Mamdani, who has simultaneously taken steps aimed at easing housing construction while also ramping up enforcement actions against landlords. Her policy priorities in the book, however, do not include increasing taxes on corporations or the state\u2019s wealthiest individuals \u2014\u00a0proposals key to paying for some of the mayor\u2019s top campaign promises.\nSpeeding up the building process\nAs part of \u201cLet Them Build,\u201d the governor pitches exempting certain housing projects from the State Environmental Quality Review Act, or SEQRA, according to the\nState of the State book\n, which lays out the governor\u2019s policy priorities for the year.\nThe governor calls for allowing housing projects that have no significant impact on the environment and are compliant with local zoning to avoid environmental review. Projects must be outside flood risk areas to qualify and still need to abide by state rules related to water use, air quality, environmental justice and protection of natural resources.\nThe book doesn\u2019t get into specifics, but notes that the state will establish different density caps for projects eligible in New York City, based on neighborhood density. Elsewhere in the state, projects can only qualify if located on \u201cpreviously disturbed\u201d land and connected to existing water and sewer systems.\nUnder Hochul\u2019s proposal, certain green and other infrastructure projects, including nature-based storm water management, public parks and recreational bike/pedestrian paths, could avoid review.\nThe governor also wants to cap the review process at two years and to clarify the timeline for waging a legal challenge to these reviews. She additionally is calling on state agencies that review and approve permits to assess their processes and find ways to speed up approvals. Agencies must issue recommendations by Sept. 1.\nHochul similarly\nproposed\ncarveouts for small housing projects, those spanning no more than 10,000 square feet, as part of her State of the State last year.\nThis year\u2019s more ambitious proposal comes after California successfully\nexempted\ninfill housing from its state environmental review process.\nEnvironmental review can add years to a project\u2019s timeline. New York City has tinkered with the city version of environmental review, allowing some housing projects to either\nskip review\nor undergo a\nshortened one\n. The state rules, however, set minimum requirements for localities to follow, meaning that significant change requires action by state.\nSen. Rachel May previously proposed legislation that would exempt much larger affordable housing projects, those consisting of up to 1,000 units, from environmental review. The measure passed in the Senate last year but died in committee in the Assembly.\nThe policy book notes that an analysis by the city and state of 1,000 projects found that \u201cvirtually none of such projects ultimately were found to have significant environmental impacts.\u201d\nOther multifamily moves\nHochul also supports legislation that would upgrade felony charges against landlords who systematically harass rent-regulated tenants across multiple buildings or are \u201crepeat serious offenders.\u201d At the urging of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, Sen. Brian Kavanaugh and Assembly member Micah Lasher introduced similar\nlegislation\nlast year.\nThe governor\u2019s policy priorities include some initiatives aimed at decreasing costs of multifamily property owners, but do not include changes that would allow for increasing rents on vacant stabilized apartments, as landlord groups have sought.\nHochul proposes reforming the property tax break J-51, which expires in June. The City Council\nrevived\nthe incentive in 2024, more than a year after the state\napproved\na new version of the tax break that limited the pool of eligible buildings. The abatement is provided to owners who renovate their stabilized apartment buildings, which must be at least 50 percent affordable, part of the state\u2019s Mitchell-Lama program or otherwise receiving \u201csubstantial government assistance.\u201d\nOwners have previously blamed outdated price schedules \u2014\u00a0which are used to determine the value of the break \u2014\u00a0for making the program unappealing. The most recent iteration of the abatement creates too narrow a universe of eligible buildings, according to landlord groups.\nThe State of the State book cites \u201cadministrative challenges\u201d as a reason that owners haven\u2019t sought the incentive, but doesn\u2019t provide details on a new program.\nThe governor doesn\u2019t mention property tax reform, nor alternative property insurance models, which are frequently floated as possible cost-cutting initiatives for owners. The State of the State book, however, proposes expanding insurance discounts for homeowners and multifamily owners, and also ramping up reporting requirements for insurance providers.\nThe governor is also seeking to increase income eligibility for Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption (SCRIE) and Disability Rent Increase Exemption (DRIE), programs that provide tax credits to landlords in exchange for freezing rents for certain senior and disabled tenants.\nHochul wants to allocate $250 million to \u201caccelerate affordable housing\u201d this year, adding to her $25 billion, five-year housing plan announced in 2022. The State of the State book doesn\u2019t mention funding for the state-based housing voucher program\napproved\nlast year.\nTuesday\u2019s address comes as Hochul faces a challenge on the left from Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado and Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman on the right in her re-election campaign. Some socialist lawmakers, including state Sen. Jabari Brisport and Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, have endorsed Delgado.\nThe election already seems to be shaping the governor\u2019s policy agenda this year. In an answer to Mamdani\u2019s pledge for free childcare, Hochul\nannounced\na $4.5 million plan this month to expand free and low-cost childcare across the state. She also proposed eliminating state income taxes on up to $25,000 of tipped income, following a federal rule\npromoted\nby President Donald Trump.\n",

        "content": "Wellington narrowly approved zoning changes that would allow former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt and Mike Meldman\u2019s Discovery Land Company to transform a polo field into a mixed-use project with homes, an equestrian complex and private club.\nOn Monday, the village council voted 3 to 2 on first reading to move the Isla Carroll Polo and Residences development forward.\nMayor Michael Napoloeone cautioned that the plans need extensive changes if the developers hope to secure approval for second and final reading in February \u2014 despite assurances that the development\u2019s polo field would be used by the United States Polo Association.\n\u201cIn the interest of preserving the [polo] field I am giving you another shot, but I don\u2019t know how you are going to get there unless there are fundamental changes,\u201d said Napoleone, who voted yes along with Vice Mayor Tanya Siskin and Councilman John McGovern. Councilwoman Maria S. Antuna and Councilwoman Amanda Silvestri voted no.\nNew York-based McCourt Partners and Scottsdale, Arizona-based Discover Land Company want to redevelop the 79.2-acre former East Isla Caroll at 3665 120th Avenue South in polo-centric Wellington into a development that would include an equestrian complex with a polo field and a private club with a polo observation deck, restaurants, a spa, racquet sports, gym, and polo training simulators.\nThe rezoning portion of the developers\u2019 request centered on being able to build 40 single-family homes on lots averaging a half acre. Under the property\u2019s present zoning, those 40 houses must be built on lots that are two acres each, large enough for an owner to construct a home with a horse stable, in keeping with Wellington\u2019s equestrian preservation zone.\nMcCourt, who said he traveled from Cairo, Egypt to speak at the meeting, told council members that he wanted to make sure his development benefited the sport of polo. He did not want it to become \u201canother soulless subdivision.\u201d\n\u201cWe have gone to great lengths to comply with your code and not ask for a single thing we are not entitled to,\u201d McCourt said. \u201cThis is a project we\u2019re extremely proud of and we have a lot of people supporting it.\u201d\nMcCourt\u2019s attorney Neil Schiller said the project has 120 letters of support and the backing of Wellington\u2019s planning staff. Among those speaking in favor was Stewart Armstrong, chairman of the USPA, who confirmed the organization has an agreement to lease the property for $1 a year, as well as the $250,000 a year cost of maintaining the field, at 10-year increments for up to 45 years.\n\u201cThat is like FAU [Florida Atlantic University] having a deal with the NFL to have games and programming at their stadium [in Boca Raton],\u201d Schiller said.\nThe USPA won\u2019t have to travel far since the neighboring National Polo Center is already used by the professional polo association. Schiller argued that not having a polo-oriented private club would be a missed opportunity. Discovery Land Company partner Ed Davitas said that the development, designed by New York-Buenos Aires architecture firm Estudio Ramos, would center around learning and watching polo.\nCritics of the project countered that the 24-stall barn would be demolished, only one of the site\u2019s two polo fields would be preserved, and that there were no facilities for horses to stay overnight on site. They also feared that the project could go the way of 23 other polo fields in Wellington and end up being replaced with more residential development should the arrangement between the developers and USPA fall apart. Schiller countered that a covenant would require that any further land use changes would have to be unanimously backed by the council if this deal is approved.\nMcGovern told Schiller that if this vote was for final approval, he would have voted against. He hopes McCourt and Discovery come back with a plan that\u2019s more than just a \u201cpolo field and a country club.\u201d\nOne way to do that was to craft a site plan where there were \u201cfive farms plus homes,\u201d McGovern added.\nA company tied to McCourt paid $52 million for East Isla Carroll in 2022, about a decade after McCourt sold the Dodgers baseball team for $2.2 billion.\nThis wasn\u2019t McCourt\u2019s first transaction in Wellington. He sold a 5.2-acre equestrian property at 13808 Fairlane Court for nearly\n$12 million\nin 2016 and a 9-acre equestrian property for $12 million in Mallet Hill that was a short walk away from Microsoft\nfounder Bill Gates\u2019 assemblage\n. (Gates\u2019 daughter, Jennifer Gates, is an equestrian.)\nDiscover Land Company, a luxury community developer, teamed up with Becker Holding Company to build Atlantic Fields, a 1,500-acre development in\nHobe Sound\nin Martin County with 317 single-family homes and a golf course.\n",

        "content": "Falling mortgage rates will drive activity in the housing market in the coming year, the National Association of Realtors\u2019 top economist said on Monday.\nSpeaking to the Chicago Association of Realtors\u2019 2026 Market Outlook conference, NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said\nlower rates\nwill bring more buyers into the market, while the stagnated inventory in Chicagoland will start to loosen up as homeowners\u2019 life circumstances change.\nDays after national brokerage\nCompass closed its bid to buy\nAnywhere Real Estate, its next-biggest competitor, presenters at the conference made no mention of the effect consolidation may have on the industry, or the fight over private listings brewing between\nCompass and Chicago\u2019s local MLS, MRED\n.\nInstead, the conference focused on the macro trends that will drive the housing market over the next year. The 30-year mortgage rate fell below 6 percent this month for the first time since 2023, sparking confidence that consumers will jump into the housing market.\n\u201cAfter three years of seeing 7 percent mortgage rate, 6 percent or even 5.9 percent mortgage rate appears much, much better,\u201d Yun said. \u201cThe consumers\u2019 mindset may be, yeah, this is the time to get into the market.\u201d\nNationally, that will inject some needed juice into a housing market that was essentially flat in 2025, according to NAR\u2019s estimates. Yun said he expects existing home sales to rise by 14 percent nationwide in 2026. NAR does not have forecasts for Chicago specifically, but a December Illinois Realtors study predicted a 5.1 percent increase in\nhome sales in the Chicago metro area\nin 2026.\nChicago\u2019s home prices have risen significantly in recent years, but a combination of high interest rates and low inventory have meant sales volume is down compared to pre-pandemic levels. But those pressures may ease throughout 2026, Yun said.\n\u201cYou are beginning to see more inventory coming onto the market, because even though (homeowners) were sincere to say they love their 3 percent mortgage rates, some have experienced major life-changing events,\u201d Yun said, like having children or retiring. \u201cSo with the passage of time, expect more inventory.\u201d\nThe economy is sending mixed signals, Yun said, but he dismissed concerns about a major housing crash in the coming year. He noted that although the stock market is at record highs and job growth has been solid, defaults on auto and credit card loans are spiking, spelling distress in some sectors.\nStill, mortgage defaults and foreclosures have remained near record lows after spiking in 2020, showing owners are largely not having trouble paying their mortgages.\n\u201cGiven that there\u2019s very little distress among homeowners, don\u2019t expect any kind of price crash,\u201d he said.\nFederal and local policy could also affect home sales this year. President Donald Trump\u2019s direction for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to\nbuy $200 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities\nlast week sparked a dip in mortgage rates, which may increase buying power and drive up demand. But Yun said policies to increase supply are needed to prevent a spike in prices.\n\u201cWe have to have supply. Without the supply, extra demand just leads to higher prices and more unaffordability,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we need to ensure that there\u2019s constant supply coming onto the market as we are trying to produce the demand.\u201d\nPolicies that increase supply could include tax credits for development, Yun said, as well as zoning changes to allow for denser housing.\nIllinois Realtors\nis backing state legislation to expand accessory dwelling units and multi-unit housing developments in more cities around the state.\n",

        "content": "Two Dallas real estate firms are teeing up a new hotel development in Uptown.\nCawley Partners and Alamo Manhattan acquired a small office building at 2909 Cole Avenue with plans to replace it with a roughly $50 million hotel. The partners picked up the 27,000-square-foot property with the intent to keep it operating as an office for now before tearing it down, Cawley Partners CEO Bill Cawley\ntold\nthe Dallas Morning News.\nThe companies are working with the city on a rezoning for the site, and groundbreaking is targeted for about 18 months from now, pending entitlements. The planned hotel would have about 140 rooms, and\nCawley\ntold the outlet that the group is already in discussions with two or three potential operators.\n\u201cWith the growth in Uptown, we think there\u2019s a shortage of quality, moderately priced hotel rooms,\u201d Cawley said. \u201cThat\u2019s the market we are going after.\u201d\nDallas Central Appraisal District records show the Cole Avenue building was completed in 1981 and is valued at roughly $3.8 million for tax purposes. The sale price was not disclosed. Cawley said total development costs are expected to come in at $50.1 million.\nThe deal marks another collaboration between Cawley Partners and\nAlamo Manhattan\n. Last year, the firms teamed up to acquire the five-story, 76,000-square-foot office building at 3400 Carlisle Street, built in 1985. Cawley Partners oversees management and leasing at that property.\nAlamo Manhattan has built a\ntrack record\nin Dallas multifamily and hospitality, including the Marriott Dallas hotel on Fairmount Street. President Matt Segrest described the Uptown project as a chance to fill a niche in the local lodging market with a select-service, extended-stay concept aimed at business and longer-term travelers.\nThe hotel plan also lands amid an active stretch for Cawley Partners. The firm recently acquired the nearly 106,000-square-foot Harwood No. 1 office building at 2651 North Harwood Street, formerly known as the old Rolex building. The seller was First United Trust, and while the purchase price was not disclosed, deed records show Cawley Partners secured a $29.5 million loan to finance the deal.\nThe Harwood property, which opened in 1984 and helped kick off the Harwood District, had fallen into foreclosure from developer Harwood International. Cawley said the firm plans to invest about $10 million in upgrades.\nBeyond Uptown,\nCawley Partners\nis also a co-owner of the Shops at Willow Bend in Plano, a retail property that\u2019s been floated as a possible site for a future Dallas Stars arena.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Multifamily distress at Lurin Capital\nis translating to deteriorating conditions at the firm\u2019s remaining properties, a new lawsuit filed against Jon Venetos\u2019 Dallas-based company shows.\nThe city of Huntsville, Alabama is the latest municipality to sue the firm over conditions at one of its properties. In a Madison County Circuit Court lawsuit filed Jan. 2, the city claims Lurin has abandoned The Flats at Redstone, a 231-unit property at 2022 Golf Road.\nThe lawsuit paints a bleak picture of the property Huntsville claims has been vacant for two years, with no utility service, missing windows and doors, a boarded-up exterior, overgrown weeds, siding hanging off of the buildings, a dilapidated metal playset and a pool full of dirty water.\nThe condition \u201cposes a substantial risk of illness or injury to anyone who enters the property,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\nThe city first flagged unsafe conditions at the property in February 2022. Lurin obtained building permits for improvements at the property, but didn\u2019t complete all of them, the lawsuit claims.\nIn August, the city sent seven code violation notices to Venetos, giving the company until Dec. 15 to resolve the issues. It failed to do so, the city alleges. It\u2019s asking the court to issue an injunction ordering Lurin to fix the property and order that it be sold if Lurin doesn\u2019t correct the\u00a0 code violations.\nThe lawsuit comes as residents of The Sutton, another Lurin-owned apartment complex in Huntsville, face days without running water, the local NBC affiliate\nreported\n. Residents of the property at 190 Shelton Road told the outlet they\u2019ve been using bottled water to bathe and flush their toilets for nearly a week.\nThe city of Huntsville joins a growing club of lenders, vendors, cities and landlords\nsuing Jon Venetos and his firm over unpaid bills\nand poor conditions at Lurin-owned properties.\nIn November, the firm was hit with a temporary restraining order that ordered residents of a Lurin-owned property in Plano to vacate due to unsafe conditions, including lack of access to water, sewer or gas.\nAcore Capital Mortgage kicked off the crush of lawsuits\nin the spring when it said Venetos defaulted on nearly $400 million in loans tied to 12 properties in Florida. Since then,\nFannie Mae sued Venetos and Lurin\nover an alleged $77 million default.\nVista Bank\nand\nKeybank\nalso filed lawsuits claiming defaults. In a series of October lawsuits, Acore claimed that Venetos personally guaranteed the money he borrowed from the lender and\nstill owes $81 million\n.\nVenetos was also\nsued by his Uptown Dallas office landlord, Rosewood Property Group\n, claiming he personally guaranteed the lease he bailed on at Rosewood Court and owes the landlord $5.3 million.\nThe lawsuits by Keybank and Vista include claims of fraud. Keybank alleged Venetos transferred $24,570 from his accounts with the bank to a personal account. Vista accused him of falsifying account statements from the lender in an attempt to take out loans elsewhere. Former employees have also come out to accuse Lurin of lying on loan reimbursement requests to lenders by inflating costs of repairs and submitting invoices for work that wasn\u2019t done.\n",

In one instance, Block reportedly didn\u2019t pay court sanctions on time, while in another, he created a conflict of interest by representing both a tenant and her landlord.\nCharging \u201cnon-refundable\u201d fees would violate bar regulations that such fees must constitute a \u201ctrue retainer,\u201d or money paid to reserve an attorney\u2019s availability for a specific case or period of time, per LAist. Former clients have reportedly claimed poor communication and a lack of availability from Block and his affiliates. Block once reportedly referred to himself as \u201ca man who has\nevicted more tenants\nthan any other human being on the planet Earth,\u201d according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\u201cWhile we cannot comment on the specifics of the case, we believe the matter will be resolved in Mr. Block\u2019s favor prior to trial at the settlement conference,\u201d Block\u2019s defense attorney, Erin Joyce, said.\nThe California State Bar Court could impose punishments like a brief suspension or an order to complete an ethics exam, or choose to disbar Block entirely. A status conference in court regarding Block\u2019s current charges from the bar is slated for Feb. 9.\nIn another case in 2023, Block\u2019s firm reportedly submitted a filing related to an eviction case that repeatedly\nreferenced fake case law\n, which LAist reported could have been produced through a misuse of\nartificial intelligence\nsoftware.

        "content": "One of Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s rare wins tied to the real estate community is now under threat.\nA group of North Side residents known as Edgewater Residents for Responsible Development filed a lawsuit against the city this week seeking to reverse\nan upzoning measure passed in October\nthat would allow for more density along a stretch of North Broadway Street.\nIt allows for taller, denser developments and a wider mix of commercial uses along a three-mile section of the corridor from Devon to Montrose avenues in Edgewater and Uptown.\nThe residents\u2019 group alleges in the suit filed in Cook County Circuit Court that the city council passed the zoning measure without properly informing all affected property owners of the ordinance\u2019s impact and that it constituted government overreach.\n\u201cThe Edgewater upzoning was unprecedented both in terms of the distance covered and the sheer number of properties affected,\u201d the complaint states.\nA representative of the mayor\u2019s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe lawsuit is the latest escalation in\nlong simmering tension\nover the measure, which has led to delayed votes and prompted the residents\u2019 group to take out a billboard along North Broadway.\n\u201cStuck in traffic? Can\u2019t find parking? 1,000 new residents won\u2019t help! Say no to upzoning,\u201d the sign reads.\nThe new zoning map reclassifies most of Broadway between Winona Street and Montrose Avenue to allow buildings up to about 80 feet tall and a variety of uses, including bars, dispensaries, tattoo parlors and salons. A new pedestrian street overlay will prohibit curb cuts and surface parking and require drive-thru businesses to maintain a walkable streetscape.\nProponents of the measure, including many in the real estate industry, celebrated the upzoning as a way to spur much needed housing in\na historic drought of new multifamily construction that is causing spikes in rent\n.\nIt was a much-needed win for the mayor\u2019s administration vis-\u00e0-vis the industry after he came under fire for a proposed\nincrease to the transfer tax\nand the city council\u2019s support for r\night of first refusal measures\non parts of the Northwest and\nSouth sides\n.\nJohnson has, however,\npushed forward similar YIMBY-style measures\nthroughout the city that curried favor with the real estate industry. In July, the city council passed an ordinance eliminating parking minimums for much of the city. And in 2023, he rolled out the\n\u201cCut the Tape\u201d campaign\naimed at reducing wait times for construction permitting.\nStill, Chicago\u2019s individual aldermen and neighborhood leaders wield significant power on the city council.\nOne alderman successfully lobbied to reduce the impact of an ADU ordinance\nlate last year. And the use of\naldermanic privilege\nto determine the fate of proposed developments in any particular ward remains the\nstandard way of doing business\n, despite its\nbias toward NIMBYism as alleged in a HUD investigation\n.",

The homes that went pending last week total $246.1 million in asking dollar volume and averaged 159 days on the market.\nThe report tracks signed contracts for single-family homes and condos asking $3 million or more in the Beaches MLS.

He is also president and CEO of Consolidated Electronic Distributors Corporation, which specializes in marine electronics, and the co-founder of Caerus Ventures.\nBorchardt renovated the home in 2024 and listed it for $26.9 million that year, Zillow shows.

        "content": "NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell quietly joined top Chicago Bears officials last weekend to tour potential sites for a new stadium.\nGoodell toured the Bears\u2019 Arlington Heights property along with two sites in northwest Indiana, including one near Wolf Lake in Hammond, according to a source familiar with the visit and first\nreported\nby the Chicago Tribune. Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren and Chairman George McCaskey led the tour, which took place Saturday \u2014 hours before the team\u2019s dramatic come-from-behind playoff win over the Green Bay Packers.\nThe commissioner\u2019s presence matters. Any new stadium project would need approval from NFL owners, and the league could provide a loan of $200 million or more to help finance construction. Goodell\u2019s site visit signals that the Bears\u2019 plans have moved beyond local posturing into league-level consideration.\nThe Indiana leg of the tour follows reporting last month that the Bears were exploring options across the\nstate line\n. Since then, Indiana Governor Mike Braun has openly courted the team, pitching a new stadium as an economic development win. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Democratic legislative leaders, by contrast, have drawn a firm line against state-funded\nstadium subsidies\n.\nThe Bears have said they would cover more than $2 billion in stadium construction costs themselves, but want public help with roughly $855 million in infrastructure improvements tied to the former Arlington International Racecourse site they own in\nArlington Heights\n. The team is also seeking changes to Illinois law that would allow it to negotiate long-term property tax agreements with local taxing bodies.\nThat request has run into resistance from Chicago lawmakers, who argue along with Gov. Pritzker that the Bears should first help address more than $500 million in remaining debt from the 2003 renovation of\nSoldier Field\n, which the city is still paying off. The Bears\u2019 lease at Soldier Field runs through 2033, though the team could exit earlier by paying a penalty.\nWarren previously called for breaking ground on a new enclosed, \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d stadium as soon as last year, with a projected three-year buildout.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Gary Barnett is firing back against claims that a\nforeclosure auction\ntied to Worldwide Plaza is a rigged attempt from SL Green and RXR to wrest control of the property.\nAn entity tied to Barnett\u2019s Extell Development filed court papers on Monday calling the lawsuit by the rival landlords meritless and accusing the firms of a last-minute scheme to block a UCC sale they\u2019ve known about for months.\nThe legal fight centers on a planned January 15 foreclosure auction for the controlling entity of 825 Eighth Avenue, the 1.8 million-square-foot Midtown office complex owned by SL Green and RXR. The landlords sued Barnett to stop the UCC sale, arguing that the auction is commercially unreasonable.\nSL Green and RXR argue the UCC sale is a sham because it was structured to deter real bidders. In their filing, the landlords say the auction\u2019s rushed timeline, lack of proper documentation and restrictive terms all but guarantee Barnett will win control of the Worldwide Plaza stake.\nBut Extell says SL Green and RXR are rewriting history.\nIn a memorandum filed in New York Supreme Court, the Barnett-backed mezzanine lender argues that SL Green and RXR have been in default for more than a year and were made aware of the foreclosure auction on October 31. Extell argues the lawsuit makes \u201cno legitimate arguments\u201d to stop the UCC sale, per court documents.\nThe filing also rejects claims that Barnett failed to supply proof that he controls the mezzanine loan, saying Extell made the original note available for inspection by the landlords. Extell also clapped back at claims the auction terms are too restrictive, saying they were explicitly negotiated and approved when the loan was originated.\nExtell also argues that SL Green and RXR cannot show irreparable harm, a key requirement for stopping a foreclosure. The landlords themselves have claimed the property\u2019s value has fallen well below the senior debt, Extell points out, meaning there is no equity left to protect, per the filing.\nGoldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank provided $190 million of mezzanine debt in 2017 that was underwritten by Korea-based Shinhan Financial Group. The property is backed\nby $940 million in senior CMBS debt\noriginated by Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank.\nThe senior debt\nwent to special servicing\nin September 2024 after law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore vacated 617,000 square feet for Brookfield\u2019s Two Manhattan West, leaving Worldwide Plaza about 40 percent vacant. That space remains empty and the building was only 63 percent occupied as of March, according to Morningstar, down from 91 percent in 2023.\n\u201cOur filing speaks for itself, and we maintain that the lender attempted to interfere with the revitalization of Worldwide Plaza and its tenants. Our formal response will be filed imminently,\u201d said an SL Green spokesperson.\nRepresentatives for SL Green and RXR did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for Extell did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

The exact address of the building was not disclosed. Ocean Avenue residents spoke out against the neighbors moving in, and city officials imposed fines against Pustilnikov, who leases the buildings. By the following week, the property was cleared out.\nThe empty low-rise buildings at 413 Ocean Avenue, spanning 11,212 square feet, and 825 Ocean Avenue, at 11,256 square feet,\u00a0 have been zoned for use as supportive housing for years, though they are surrounded by upscale condominiums that have sold for as much as $7 million. The buildings were purchased by the Bourne Financial Group in early 2023 for $13 million and are leased by Pustilnikov, who said he aims to earn rental income from them while he seeks change of use permits from the city of Santa Monica.\nThe November dustup was the second time in a span of a few months that Pustilnikov failed to fill the building, as a\nplan to house county behavioral health patients\nat the site last year was also scrapped. Pustilnikov, Bourne Financial Group and St. Joseph Center had approached county mental health officials about using the building, ultimately earning $3.5 million in bridge housing funds to renovate and house homeless residents. The community backlash was swift, and the $3.5 million in funding was canceled. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you\u2019re not allowed to help people that are struggling in affluent communities,\u201d Pustilnikov told the Times.\nAfter that, Pustilnikov said he was \u201cdone\u201d trying to fill the building until Pacific Coast Healthcare approached him about operating a sober living facility at the site. \u201cI said, \u2018Sure, why not?\u2019 It sounded fine.

The property spans seven buildings, including a 15,000-square-foot amenity building, and is approximately 60 percent leased. The seller\u2019s identity and the building\u2019s addresses were not disclosed.\nThe $600 million purchase grows\nHealthpeak\n\u2019s footprint in South San Francisco to about 6.5 million square feet across 210 acres. The company, previously known as HCP, kicked off the Bay Area biotech construction boom in 2015 with the first phase of South San Francisco\u2019s 800,000-square-foot Cove at Oyster Point development. Since then, millions of square feet of life sciences and biotech space have been built in the Peninsula city.\nAs\nfederal funds for life sciences\nand research have dried up over the past year, firms have shied away from building more office and research space in South San Francisco and beyond. Biotech developer IQHQ is\nlooking to pause development\non 857,000 square feet of its Spur project in South San Francisco, and Forge Development is seemingly\nbacking away from its initial proposal\nfor a 900,000-square-foot life sciences campus in Berkeley.\nHealthpeak hasn\u2019t been immune to the downturn. In the last quarter of 2025, the company sold approximately $325 million outpatient medical assets totaling about 834,000 square feet. The firm also said it is negotiating sales for additional outpatient medical facilities as well as recapitalizations and loan repayments that could generate an additional $700 million or more in proceeds.\nVacancy in the Northern Peninsula life sciences market, including South San Francisco, was\nat 39.8 percent\nat the end of the third quarter of last year, per CBRE\u2019s Q3 report. But this year could bring changes, as active tenant requirements increased 73 percent across the Bay Area compared to the previous quarter and 62 percent year-over-year, according to Bisnow.\nSteelWave is among those betting on a comeback, as the firm is\nmoving forward with its plan\nto turn the Golden Gate Produce Terminal in South San Francisco into a 2.5-million-square-foot, five-building life sciences campus.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Lennar Homes officially backed away from a key regulatory step for a large, controversial residential development outside San Antonio, withdrawing an application for a wastewater treatment facility that would have supported the project.\nThe Miami-based builder recently pulled its application with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for a permit tied to its proposed Comfort 590 development, according to a filing\nobtained\nby the San Antonio Business Journal. The move removes a critical piece of infrastructure for the planned subdivision in Comfort, an unincorporated Kendall County community about 45 miles northwest of downtown\nSan Antonio\n.\nLennar, the nation\u2019s\nsecond-largest homebuilder\n, proposed building roughly 1,100 homes on about 600 acres along Highway 87, with entitlements allowing capacity for another 1,300 units. Because the area lacks centralized sewer service, the project hinged on a standalone wastewater treatment system capable of disposing of up to 600,000 gallons per day.\nThe\ncompany\nformally withdrew the permit application on Dec. 22. Lennar declined to comment on the decision or clarify whether it still intends to pursue the development.\nThe pullback marked a milestone for local opponents. Comfort Neighbors, a grassroots group formed to fight the project, hailed the withdrawal as a major win after more than a year of organizing against what it described as an outsized, high-density development for a town of roughly 3,000 residents.\nThe group includes landowners adjacent to the proposed site, who raised concerns about water availability, wastewater impacts and broader strain on local infrastructure. Members have argued that the development would threaten air and water quality and undermine the area\u2019s rural character, according to the publication. Over the past year, Comfort Neighbors has staged town halls, community meetings and a rally in June to oppose the project.\nThe episode is a familiar tune for Lennar in the region, though not one from which the builder is used to backing down. Two other Lennar developments are grappling with infrastructure limits and increasingly organized local resistance.\nAnother proposed 600,000-gallon wastewater permit is under review for the builder\u2019s proposed 850-home Broken Cedar Ranch in Comal County, north of San Antonio, that would pump treated wastewater into nearby Canyon Lake. TCEQ scheduled a\npublic meeting\nto address the development for Feb. 10 at Canyon Lake High School.\nA proposed 2,900-home development,\nGuajolote Ranch\n, northwest of San Antonio near the suburb of Helotes did receive a wastewater permit, despite local opposition. It allows discharge of up to 1 million gallons daily into Helotes Creek, a tributary that feeds the Edwards Aquifer, which is a drinking water source for more than 2.5 million people across 13 counties, according to the Edwards Aquifer Authority.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "New York\u2019s highest court on Tuesday upheld the city\u2019s ability to charge owners a fee when converting apartments reserved for artists, reversing a lower court\u2019s ruling that the practice was unconstitutional.\nThe New York Court of Appeals, in a 6-1\ndecision\n, found that a state Appellate Court wrongfully\nconcluded\nthat a portion of the 2021 Soho and Noho rezoning violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s takings clause.\nAs part of the rezoning, new rules were applied to so-called Joint Live-Work Quarters for Artists, which are reserved for artists certified by the city. Owners of such units must pay $100 per square foot to an arts fund run by the city before receiving approval from City Planning to convert the apartments for other use.\nCritics of the fee argued that it stood in the way of owners bringing their properties into compliance with the law. The state\u2019s multiple dwelling law was\namended\nin 2022 to allow non-artists who lived in JLWQA units on or before the rezoning was approved to continue to inhabit the apartments legally. But if a non-artist tries to buy such a property, they would need to convert the artist units before legally occupying them or renting them out to non-artist tenants.\nThe Coalition for Fairness in Soho and Noho, a group representing owners and residents of the neighborhoods, filed a lawsuit in February 2022, seeking to annul the rezoning, which allowed more residential and commercial use within a 50-block area.\nWhen a state Supreme Court sided with the city, the coalition appealed, but focused on the artists\u2019 fee rather than the entire rezoning. A panel of Appellate Division judges\nreversed\nthe lower court\u2019s decision in December 2024, finding the fee to be unconstitutional and without any legitimate land-use rationale.\nBut the Court of Appeals found that hitting a property owner with a standalone fee doesn\u2019t invoke the takings clause. Such a \u201cmonetary exaction\u201d must be in lieu of a transfer of a private property interest to qualify as a violation of the clause.\n\u201cPetitioners may desire a property interest in a more valuable and less restrictive form, and they may want it without strings attached, but the opportunity to relinquish one form of property to acquire another, in exchange for a monetary payment to an arts fund, is not a taking,\u201d Judge Jenny Rivera wrote.\nAttorneys for the coalition, along with Judge Michael Garcia, the lone dissenting opinion, argue that the fact that the government is making a monetary demand tied to a specific property interest as a condition of receiving permits is enough to constitute an illegal taking.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a false distinction between real property and money that the court drew,\u201d said Chris Kieser, an attorney for the coalition.\nHe said his clients are considering whether to ask the Supreme Court to hear the case.\nThe city legalized JLWQAs in the manufacturing districts of Soho in the 1970s. As the area transformed, turning into a sought-after residential neighborhood, technically illegal ground-floor retail and residential lofts sprouted up as the number of certified artists in the city declined. As of 2022, only 36 of the city\u2019s 1,636 JLWQA units were occupied by certified artists, and the city had certified fewer than 100 artists in the preceding decade.\nThe city rarely enforced the artist units\u2019 residency requirements, and the Adams administration stopped efforts to increase penalties for violations.\nKieser said the city is holding conversions of these units hostage, even as it wants to end the program (new JLWQA units can\u2019t be created) and make way for affordable housing. The Soho and Noho rezoning was supposed to pave the way for more than 3,000 units of housing over the next decade, though\nprogress\nhas been slow.\nA spokesperson for the city\u2019s Law Department said he was pleased by the decision.\n",

        "content": "Some years ago, the Woodland Hills Country Club in Los Angeles County sold its 94-acre golf course.\nToday, hundreds of local residents are flocking to meetings and rallies to stop a\n398-home project\non 20 acres of that land.\nOne of the opponents was a member of the club when it decided to sell. \u201cWe needed the money,\u201d he told another person at one opposition meeting. But the buyer was a developer, Arrimus Capital of Newport Beach, so the proposal could not have been a surprise.\nWhat was a surprise \u2014 at least to the furious locals \u2014 is that the project apparently does not need the usual public hearings, environmental reviews and political approval that have made Los Angeles one of the tightest and most expensive housing markets in the nation. For this very reason, the fast track was created in the past four years by state legislation (\nAB2011 and AB2243\n).\nNIMBY fights are usually about size and affordability, but these issues mean very different things in different places, as the Woodland Hills fight shows.\nIn New York City, rezonings tend to be for multifamily buildings in progressive neighborhoods, where opponents demand shorter buildings and more affordability.\nIn suburban areas, opponents tend to be single-family homeowners who want projects to have fewer units and less affordability, because they fear traffic and poor people.\nThe Woodland Hills project will have 97 affordable apartments, most of them for seniors. Another 175 homes will be single-family and 126 will be apartments. It adds up to 76 percent market-rate and 24 percent affordable, which in Crown Heights would have people screaming \u201cgentrification!\u201d\nThe NIMBYs of Woodland Hills \u2014 a community of\n80,000 people\n\u2014 are mostly aghast at the idea of having about 800 new neighbors. This 1 percent population increase, they say, would cause gridlock in the event of a fire disaster like the one they witnessed from their cul-de-sacs last winter.\nI am not persuaded. If there\u2019s gridlock during a fire, 99 percent of it would be caused by the current residents. If the situation were as dangerous as they claim, they would be moving out en masse, or the government would be condemning their homes. That isn\u2019t happening.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s proposals to address rising insurance costs for multifamily housing amount to anything? What about her promise to reform J-51? See pages 32 to 35 of her\nState of the State Book\nand send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: If you have a New York building with\nlarge refrigeration equipment\n, you must report its leakage rate to the state Department of Environmental Conservation in March or face a fine of up to $2,500 plus $500 per day after that. The deadline for medium-sized equipment is June. The idea is to curb leaks that contribute to climate change.\nElsewhere\u2026\nRent control, a poster child among economists for the wrong way to address housing affordability, could be returning to Massachusetts \u2014 not because socialists have taken over the legislature, but because a proposal appears destined for the statewide ballot in November.\nOne poll found 63 percent of voters would support and only 31 percent would oppose the proposal, which would cap rent increases at 5 percent a year or the rate of inflation, whichever is lower.\nHousing guru Jay Parsons is raising alarms.\n\u201cMassachusetts voters banned rent control in the 1990s due to numerous unintended consequences. Studies by MIT and Harvard later showed the REMOVAL of rent caps led to reduced crime, improved building maintenance and improved property values,\u201d he\nposted on LinkedIn\n.\n\u201cBut this is a new generation of voters \u2014 few of whom likely remember the reasons they banned rent control three decades ago.\u201d\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$8.15 million\nfor a 4,440-square-foot townhouse at 409 Sackett Street in Carroll Gardens. Ellen Gottleib and Neely Johnson with Corcoran had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$141 million\nfor the 283,465-square-foot, 19-story office building at 3 East 54th Street in Sutton Place. Cohen Brothers Realty sold the property to Vornado.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$11.75 million\nfor a 7,000-square-foot townhouse at 416 West 51st Street in Hell\u2019s Kitchen.

        "content": "Los Angeles\u2019\nMeasure ULA transfer tax\nhas crossed a significant revenue threshold.\nNearly three years after being implemented, proceeds from so-called \u201cmansion tax\u201d have\nexceeded $1 billion\n, Commercial Observer reported. Under the ordinance, transactions for properties between $5.3 million and $10.6 million incur an additional 4 percent tax, and deals for $10.6 million or more trigger a 5.5 percent tax. City officials have long said that money earned from the transfer tax will go toward funding affordable housing and homelessness prevention programs.\nAs of Jan. 8, Measure ULA has generated more than $1 billion from 1,435 transactions, according to Los Angeles Housing Department data cited by CO. Of those deals, 60 percent were for single-family residences, 24 percent were for nonresidential commercial properties and 13 percent were for multifamily sales. The ZIP codes of 90049, 90272 and 90077, encompassing top-tier Los Angeles neighborhoods such as Brentwood, Bel Air and\nPacific Palisades\n, accounted for the largest share of sales producing ULA funds.\nThe amount of money coming in from ULA, implemented April 1, 2023, is growing with each fiscal year. Over the past six months, the ordinance collected $306.7 million, meaning it will likely surpass the previous year\u2019s $413.2 million before the end of the fiscal year in June. The resulting cash on hand has led to the largest\nnotice of funding availability, or NOFA\n, in Los Angeles Housing Department history.\nNearly 74 percent of ULA funds in fiscal year 2025-26 are allocated for\naffordable housing\nprograms, such as multifamily development, preserving property affordability and a homeownership opportunities initiative prioritizing first-time buyers and local land trusts. The rest of the money is set aside for homelessness prevention programs, including short-term emergency assistance, eviction defense, and income support for seniors and persons with disabilities.\nCommercial real estate executives have been outspoken in\ntheir opposition\nto ULA, with some choosing to\ninvest outside of Los Angeles\ncity limits entirely. Universe Holdings decided to pause or cancel transactions in L.A. due to the tax, selling several properties in early 2023 before ULA went into effect, and the company hadn\u2019t bought or sold any as of last spring, according to CO.\n\u201cBuyers and sellers are absolutely disgruntled over ULA, and it is not going away. It\u2019s actually getting worse every day,\u201d\nAaron Kirman\n, CEO of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California, said at\nThe Real Deal\u2019s Building Back L.A.\npanel in September. \u201cWhen you are doing these deals and sellers can be charged anywhere between 4.5 and 5 percent additional fees on top of commissions and closing costs and everything else, it\u2019s make it or break it for a lot of these developers, not only on the luxury level, but for apartments, for retail, and everything in the middle.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Nuveen has taken ownership of the 35-story office tower at\n321 North Clark Street\n, marking the latest slipup in a series of mezzanine loan gambles that have shifted from passive investments into losses or active ownership for the asset manager.\nChicago-based Nuveen, in partnership with Los Angeles-based\nPacific Coast Capital Partners (PCCP)\nthrough a co-managed fund, completed a takeover of the 897,000-square-foot River North property. The transaction wiped out the equity of the previous ownership venture \u2014 consisting of Larry Levy\u2019s Chicago-based Diversified Real Estate Capital, Houston-based Hines and Los Angeles-based American Realty Advisors.\nThe deal underscores the ongoing distress in the office market and risks associated with mezzanine debt positions taken before interest rates jumped in 2022. Nuveen provided a\n$296 million in floating rate loan for the property in 2021\n, then sold off a $222 million first mortgage portion of the debt to a consortium of German banks, while keeping an approximately $74 million mezzanine position, according to public records and people familiar with the property\u2019s financing.\nNow, Nuveen\u2019s mezzanine position has been converted into an ownership interest, according to a spokesperson for the firm, which is the real estate investment arm of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America, the pooled asset manager for educator retirement accounts. It\u2019s unclear how much cash PCCP brought to the table to enter the deal, as Nuveen declined to answer detailed questions about the size of their respective stakes in the property.\nDiversified, PCCP, Hines and American Realty Advisors didn\u2019t return requests for comment.\nFor Nuveen, 321 North Clark adds to a\nseries of office troubles\nwhere mezzanine loans it originated to Chicago office landlords didn\u2019t go as planned, wiping out investments, or, in this case, requiring a pivot to hands-on ownership. Mezzanine loans Nuveen funded have sunk with borrowers such as\nBlackstone at 350 North Orleans Street\n, which is currently facing foreclosure, as well as\nSterling Bay at 600 West Chicago Avenue\n, which sold for just $89 million last year after fetching $510 million in 2018.\nDespite the circumstances of the takeover, Nuveen is signaling aggressive moves to stabilize the asset. The firm announced that it hired Telos Group as the new leasing agent for the 936,000-square-foot tower, replacing Hines in that capacity. Hines will, however, retain its role as property manager.\nNuveen emphasized that the property is \u201copen for business\u201d and well-capitalized to compete for tenants in a fierce leasing market.\n\u201cWe have capital available to invest in tenant improvements, leasing incentives and property enhancements \u2014 sending a strong signal to the leasing community that 321 North Clark has stable, well-capitalized ownership dedicated to creating a best-in-class tenant experience,\u201d a Nuveen spokesperson said.\nThe firm\u2019s venture with PCCP plans to deploy additional equity capital to modernize the building, including upgrades to the conference center and tenant lounge areas.\nNuveen declined to disclose specific occupancy figures but reaffirmed its confidence in the property\u2019s long-term value. CBRE, the world\u2019s largest commercial real estate brokerage, was previously one of the building\u2019s prominent tenants until it left the property to\nmove into 300 North LaSalle Street\nin recent months.\n",

        "content": "A small, distressed River North office building is headed for a residential reset, as a local developer leans into Chicago\u2019s growing wave of modest office-to-apartment conversions.\nChicago-based Monroe Residential Partners paid $5.4 million for the four-story, 48,000-square-foot loft-style office building at 401 West Ontario Street, with plans to convert the property into 57 apartments, firm founder Drew Friestedt told Crain\u2019s, which first\nreported\nthe sale. The sale adds another bite-sized project to downtown\u2019s conversion pipeline, where underused offices are increasingly giving way to housing.\nThe building, which is roughly half leased, became financially untenable as offices, Friestedt said. It was also the subject of a foreclosure suit filed in 2024.\n\u201cThe revenue from rent is barely enough to cover your real estate taxes,\u201d\nFriestedt\ntold the outlet. \u201cThe common theme is they don\u2019t work as office buildings anymore, and they\u2019re selling to people who can try to make the building work as residential.\u201d\nMonroe is budgeting about $20 million all-in for the project, including the acquisition, and is currently lining up construction financing. The firm aims to break ground in October and complete the conversion roughly a year later.\nPlans call for a mix of compact one-bedroom units of about 450 square feet, with starting rents of about $2,300 a month, alongside larger two-bedroom, duplex-style apartments measuring roughly 1,200 square feet and renting for as much as $3,800. The pricing reflects continued strength in downtown apartment demand, even as new supply remains muted.\nThe project will require zoning relief. While the site\u2019s DX-7 zoning allows residential use above the ground floor, Monroe plans to add ground-floor units, triggering the need for approval from the Zoning Board of Appeals.\nMonroe Residential Partners has built a portfolio of mixed-use and residential projects, including developments at 851 West Grand Avenue and 1313 West Randolph Street.\nGreenstone Partners broker Jordan Multack represented Monroe in the latest deal, while Frontline Real Estate Partners served as receiver and marketed the property.\nThe seller was a venture led by Chicago investor Sean Conlon, who bought the building for $6.6 million in 2015. After being hit with a\nforeclosure suit\ntied to a 2017 mortgage, the property was marketed through a receivership sale.\nConlon\ntold the publication that he ultimately sold the building in full satisfaction of the loan after it failed to make \u201ceconomic sense\u201d amid high property taxes.\nThe deal comes as Chicago\u2019s broader development pipeline\nremains thin\n. Just three large-scale downtown projects totaling fewer than 600 units are slated to be completed in 2026, according to Integra Realty Resources.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

More than 70 percent of renters in both cities spend at least 30 percent of their pre-tax income on housing, far above the regional average of 56 percent of renters and national levels hovering at around 50 percent, the Chronicle reported, citing U.S. Census Bureau data. Over the past five years, Vacaville\u2019s percentage of cost-burdened renters has increased faster than any other Bay Area city.\nThe hike in rents in Vacaville comes despite a building blitz in the city. Between 2015 and 2021, developers completed about 2,900 residential units in the city, more than double its state housing target and enough to make it one of the Bay Area\u2019s top housing producers by raw volume.\nThe issue is with the type of housing that is being built \u2014 mostly higher-end single-family homes.\nMultifamily housing\n, including townhomes and small apartment buildings, comprises less than 10 percent of Vacaville\u2019s housing stock.\nCash buyers relocating from pricier Bay Area markets bid up home prices as renters face limited supply and rising rents. The city of Vacaville is also facing projected budget deficits of about $9 million and a hiring freeze for local government.\nWith a dearth of multifamily and below-market-rate housing, younger workers might not be able to make ends meet in the Solano County city.\n\u201cThese outlying cities really are the next frontier of displacement,\u201d Cristal Gallegos, director of community-led nonprofit Vallejo Housing Justice Coalition, told the Chronicle. \u201cOnce the old adage of \u2018\ndrive until you qualify\n[for a mortgage]\u2019 stops applying to the Bay Area, you know you have a serious problem.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Fort Worth area homes depreciated slightly in 2025.\nMedian home sale prices fell below 2024 in all counties in the Fort Worth area, according to the Greater Fort Worth Association of Realtors and the Texas Real Estate Research Center. Most of the regional declines are shallow, but in Denton County, one of the state\u2019s hottest home development hubs, prices fell more steeply.\nIn Fort Worth proper, the 2025 median sale price was $330,000, down 1.5 percent from the year prior. Tarrant County overall was practically unchanged, with a price decline of 0.3 percent at $349,000. Johnson County to the south and Parker County to the west experienced declines of 1.4 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively.\n\u201cI would call that, in my professional opinion, a flat market,\u201d said Jim Fite, CEO of Century 21 Judge Fite, a leading North Texas brokerage. \u201cIf I\u2019m a seller, an owner, my equity is not being withered away. And as a buyer, I can\u2019t just go out and steal a house now.\u201d\nDenton County, which straddles Fort Worth and Dallas to the north, is a notable outlier.\nDenton County experienced a 4.3 percent decline in home prices from 2024 to 2025, falling to a median of $445,000. In December alone, prices fell almost 10 percent, year-over-year.\nWhile sales and prices tend to move in tandem, they diverged in Denton County last year, with the number of closed sales rising by a steady 2.2 percent in December while prices fell, according to the MetroTex Association of Realtors.\nHomebuilding may play a part in the trend. Developers have been blitzing north from Dallas for years, with\nactivity especially concentrated along the Dallas North Tollway\n, but also spreading laterally.\nCelina\n, which Denton County partially includes, is\none of the hottest residential markets in the state\n. Pilot Point, wholly contained in Denton County,\nboomed\nduring the pandemic and\ncontinues to attract developers\u2019 interest\n. Denton itself has drawn billions in investment, including a\nPerot family project\nthat will deliver 6,000 single-family homes and 3,000 apartments.\nOther upcoming single-family projects include the\nCole Ranch\nand the\nAlpha Ranch\n, both set to have over 4,000 homes apiece, and the\nFurst Ranch\n, expected to have 1,300 homes. Multifamily development in the pipeline includes\nChadwick Farms\n, a mixed-use project with 900 apartments and a hotel, and\nThe Renegade\n, a Holt Lunsford Commercial project in downtown Denton.\n",

Rounding out the year at negative 311,369 square feet, it far exceeded negative 4 million square feet from 2021, and has steadily increased since then. The fourth quarter recorded a negative absorption of 439,859 square feet, breaking the market\u2019s two-quarter stretch of positive absorption.\nVacancies, while still elevated, have decreased to 26.3 percent after peaking at nearly 27 percent in 2024. But, like Dallas, return to work mandates and a narrowing development pipeline have helped the Houston office market perk up.\nSubmarkets on top\nOf the city\u2019s office submarkets, the Galleria performed best in the fourth quarter, JLL reported.\nThe Galleria logged nearly 200,000 square feet of positive absorption, thanks to Texas Dow Employees Credit Union\u2019s move to 121,000 square feet at the building at 2000 Post Oak Boulevard and Camden Property Trust\u2019s relocation to 104,000 square feet at the building at 2800 Post Oak Boulevard.\nThe Galleria also came in second in terms of annual net absorption, recording nearly 341,000 square feet of positive office space absorption. The suburbs closest to Houston topped the list with more than 555,000 square feet of absorption for the year. Katy Freeway West, the western part of I-10 stretching from Houston to Katy, came in third on the list. It logged 215,000 square feet of positive absorption by the end of the year.\nThe Galleria\u2019s high absorption rate marks a win for the submarket that had an elevated vacancy rate of 32 percent at the end of 2025. The retail hotspot has about 22.5 million square feet of office space.\nThe submarket could expect a boost after being selected for one of the city\u2019s coveted branded condo projects.\nDeiso Moss\nannounced plans to develop a 44-story hotel and condo tower at 2120 Post Oak Boulevard, as the city races to level up its branded condo offerings.\nOffice trades\nOffice building sales inched up in 2025, compared to 2024, to 9.7 million square feet \u2014 a slight edge over 2024\u2019s 9.5 million square feet.\nLast year, Houston office operators made lemonade out of the city\u2019s glut of old office space. Of the\ntop 10 largest office trades\n, at least five were distress-related sales, including the\nbiggest office sale of 2025\n, in which Houston\u2019s largest office complex, Houston Center returned to its lender, AustralianSuper.\nTwo of the top sales involved buildings eyed for conversion. Chicago-based 3L Real Estate plans to convert\nOne City Center\n, at 1021 Main Street, into 93 corporate suites for visiting employees and 460 traditional apartments.\nThe market\u2019s low valuations and excess of old space made way for\nowner-occupiers\nto enter the market. These buyers took more than 2 million square feet of vacant space off the Houston office market in 2025, Partners Real Estate reported..\nThe closest thing to a trophy office trade on the list was the sale of Energy Center I, an Energy Corridor office building at 585 North Dairy Ashford that was built in 2008 and renovated in 2020.\nExperts predict trophy trades will ratchet up this year.\n\u201cAs high quality space and stable ownership increasingly drive tenant decisions, competition for premium properties is expected to intensify throughout 2026,\u201d JLL\u2019s\u2019 report said.\n",

So far, 168 deeds have recorded, totaling $425.3 million in sales.\nLed by Bob Vail, Kolter Urban is the condo development division of Bobby Julien\u2019s Delray Beach-based Kolter Group.\nThe project is just shy of a decade in the making.\nKolter started acquiring the 2.6-acre site for the project in 2017, spending $34.4 million across several purchases. Kolter\nlaunched sales\nfor the towers in 2021 and secured\na $240 million construction loan\nfrom Wells Fargo in 2022. Designed by Kobi Karp Architects and interiors firm ID &amp; Design International, the project was initially slated to finish in 2024.\nSelene\u2019s units range from two- to four-bedrooms that span between 2,300 and 5,300 square feet, according to a news release. The towers also have a few larger penthouse units. Amenities in the buildings include two pools, a fitness center, a business center, a theater, a gaming lounge and\nprivate dining space\n.\nThe most expensive closing in the towers so far was Beau Aero and Alfredo Martin\u2019s $12.2 million purchase of the 5,300-square-foot unit S2701, records show. That sale amounted to $2,300 per square foot. Beau Aero Martin founded a workwear company based in Columbia, Missouri.\nM. Michele Burns, the former CEO of Mercer and a member of the Goldman Sachs Board of Directors, bought unit S2702 for $10.7 million, according to property records.\nTwenty-two units remain to be sold, priced between $2.7 million and $11.7 million, a spokesperson confirmed.\nSelene is one of the latest completed projects in\na packed pipeline of Broward County residential developments\n.\nLong passed over by developers for the glitzier markets in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach County, as the region has boomed post-pandemic, developers have\nturned their gaze to Fort Lauderdale and Pompano Beach\n. At least two dozen projects totaling more than 3,900 units are in the works, led by some of South Florida\u2019s biggest names: Jorge P\u00e9rez, Edgardo Defortuna, Isaac Toledano and Miki Naftali, among others.\nJulien is onto the next one in another market, though.

        "content": "Crescent Real Estate closed its latest investment fund, pulling in $241.5 million for commercial real estate moves, as fundraising across private equity remains under pressure.\nThe Fort Worth-based firm wrapped up what it called \u201cGP Invitation Fund IV\u201d on Dec. 31, falling shy of its $250 million target, according to federal filings. The raise marks Crescent\u2019s fourth invitation fund and comes three years after the company collected $265 million for Fund III in 2022 through a similarly invitation-only process, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe closing offers a snapshot of a tougher capital raising climate. Global private equity fundraising slid for a third straight year in 2025, dropping 12.7 percent to $480.3 billion from $551.2 billion in 2024, according to S&amp;P Global. Fewer funds came to market as well, a slowdown that cut across buyout, growth and diversified strategies.\nChristopher Goff\n, senior managing director and head of capital formation at Crescent, described 2025 as an \u201cadjustment year\u201d after the easy money era that followed the Federal Reserve\u2019s pandemic-era rate cuts. Inflation and higher borrowing costs have since reset expectations.\nEven so, Crescent wasted little time\ndeploying capital\n. Goff \u2014 Chairman John Goff\u2019s son \u2014 told the outlet that about 15 percent to 20 percent of Fund IV has already been committed, including multiple Uptown Dallas office deals that closed late last year. Those included the 19-story building at\n2100 McKinney\n, anchored by CBRE, and the\nTexas Capital Center\nat 2000 McKinney Avenue, which several market sources pegged as the largest office sale in Dallas-Fort Worth in 2025.\nThe fund\u2019s flexible mandate allows Crescent to invest across office, residential and hotel projects, rather than locking into a single property type. Lately, trophy offices have emerged as the firm\u2019s highest conviction play, even as many institutional investors remain wary of the sector, according to Goff.\nCrescent was founded in 1987 by John Goff and the late Richard Rainwater and reported $4.3 billion in assets under management at the end of 2024. Across all strategies, the company controls more than $16 billion of real estate, including 67 million square feet of offices, 10,100 apartments and 9,300 hotel keys, according to its website.\nIn North Texas, Crescent continues to double down on Uptown, where it owns the iconic Crescent complex, reacquired in 2021, and is advancing construction on the second office building at its Crescent Fort Worth development, anchored by JPMorgan Chase.\nWhile the firm has expressed interest in seeing Dallas thrive broadly \u2014 including Downtown, which faces fresh headwinds after AT&amp;T\u2019s announced exit \u2014 Crescent\u2019s strategy remains tightly focused.\n\u201cWe want to be super disciplined,\u201d Goff said. \u201cWhere do we feel like we have a comparative advantage? And where do our investors feel like we can operate better than anybody else?\u201d\nFor now, that answer points squarely to Uptown Dallas \u2014 and to offices \u2014 even as much of the market stays on the sidelines.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The move comes months after ownership defaulted on the debt at the outdoor shopping center, stretching from West 97th to West 100th Street on Columbus Avenue.\nChetrit and Stellar began missing monthly $1.9 million debt payments in August, according to the lawsuit. Chetrit vowed to make good on the back payments and resume monthly payments after receiving a\ndefault notice in October\n, but failed to actually do so, according to the suit, leading to another default notice this month.\nOwnership allegedly owes $370 million, including more than $7 million in interest and late charges.\nLaw firms for the defendants either declined to comment or did not respond to the publication\u2019s request. No legal response has been filed either.\nThe 270,000-square-foot shopping center is anchored by Whole Foods and Target. The debt has been in special servicing at least twice, including once in late 2023 due to tenant distress from the pandemic, leading to a three-year extension on the mortgage.\nThe shopping center is separate from a five-building, 710-unit multifamily portfolio that sits above the retail portion of the complex. In August, UDR, the Colorado-based multifamily real estate investment trust, and its partner MetLife began exploring a sale of the rental portion of the property for\nup to $500 million\n.\nFour of the five buildings are free market; the fifth is subject to an older 421a agreement under which an owner could raise rents by 47 percent before hitting their legal rent limits.\nUDR teamed up with MetLife in 2012 to buy the portfolio from the late Laurence Gluck\u2019s Stellar and the Chetrit Organization for\n$635 million\n.\n",

Their footprint ballooned during the pandemic-era population surge, as institutional capital chased fast-growing Sun Belt markets.\nBy some estimates, corporate investors now own between 20 and 25 percent of Florida\u2019s single-family rental homes.\nThat buying spree has fueled backlash from would-be homeowners and\npoliticians\n, who argue that deep-pocketed landlords are crowding them out and shrinking an already tight supply of homes for sale.\nTrump has offered few details on how a ban would work, in statements that marked his first major foray into the housing affordability debate. He is expected to outline the proposal more fully at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland later this month.\nFlorida has been a cash cow for large-scale rental operators.\nInvitation Homes\n, the nation\u2019s largest single-family rental landlord and a former Blackstone unit, generated $556 million in revenue from Florida properties in the first nine months of last year, according to financial filings. The company manages nearly 27,000 homes statewide, with a portfolio valued at $4.2 billion.\nAmerican Homes 4 Rent\nowns almost 8,700 single-family properties in Florida worth roughly $2.1 billion. Privately held firms such as Progress Residential,\nTricon Residential\nand\nFirstKey Homes\ncontrol tens of thousands more units, though their exact holdings are harder to pin down. One estimate put the number of Florida single-family homes owned by corporate investors at 117,000 as of late 2024, the outlet said.\nSmaller players have joined the rush, too.\nTampa-based Second Avenue\nraised $250 million in 2022 after quietly building a single-family rental platform since 2017.\nEconomists are skeptical that a ban would meaningfully move the needle.\n\u201cInstitutional investors own about 20 percent of the single-family rental market nationally, so it\u2019s not a big part of the housing stock,\u201d Jeff Korzenik, chief economist at Fifth Third Bank, told the outlet. \u201cThe reality is that affordability comes down to supply, and who owns that supply is a less important factor.\u201d\n\u2014 Rachel Stone\n",

        "content": "A Burr Ridge mansion that former Bulls center Eddy Curry once lost through foreclosure sold on Tuesday for $4 million, the most expensive sale in the western Chicago suburb in more than a year.\nThe sprawling home at 6655 Lee Court has seven bedrooms and 13 bathrooms and covers 14,600 square feet. Built in 2006, it sits on a one-acre lot on an exclusive cul-de-sac, next door to the house owned by late rapper Juice WRLD\u2019s mother,\nCarmela Wallace\n.\nThe home went on the market in June last year asking nearly $5 million. The price dropped to $4.5 million in September, and it went under contract in November. The sale price is over $2 million less than what Curry paid for the house in 2006.\nRafael Murillo, the Compass agent who represented the buyers, confirmed the sale and said his clients bought the house because it offered a secluded, exclusive location while still being near downtown Chicago.\nThe suburb\nis a little over 20 miles from downtown.\n\u201cThe amount of land here is something you simply won\u2019t find in nearby communities like Hinsdale or other close-in suburbs, where lots are far more limited,\u201d Murillo said.\nHe declined to name the buyers, but said they plan to make renovations to the home, including adding an outdoor kitchen and a pool. Public records that could reveal the identity of the buyers aren\u2019t yet recorded in Cook County.\n\u201cBuilding a home of this caliber from the ground up today would likely cost double the list price \u2014 or more \u2014 purely in construction costs,\u201d Murillo said.\nGinny Stewart and Paige Kelly of Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty represented the sellers. Stewart didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nThe home features an attached \u201ctownhome-like suite,\u201d according to listing information, with a separate entrance and its own kitchen, laundry and bedrooms. The primary suite covers 1,800 square feet and includes a fireplace, sitting area and two walk in closets.\nCurry bought the house in 2006 for $6.1 million. At the time, he was playing for the New York Knicks after four years with the Bulls. In 2007, Curry\u2019s lender, Morgan Stanley Credit Corp, moved to foreclose on the house. The proceedings lasted until 2014, when Curry handed the house over to a loan servicing agency.\nIn 2007, Curry and his family were robbed at gunpoint in the house, according to reporting from the time. The offenders were also later charged in connection to a robbery of then-Miami Heat player Antoine Walker that same year.\nOral surgeon Louis Korompilas bought the house out of foreclosure for a discounted $3.1 million in 2014, according to property records. He transferred the property to family members in 2020, but it was transferred back to a trust under his name shortly before it went up for sale last year, property records show.\nThe owners paid $45,500 in property taxes in 2024, records show.\nThe $4 million price tag makes it the most expensive house to sell in Burr Ridge since July 2024, when a home on Cabernet Court brought in $5 million, listing services show. Wallace\npaid $6.9 million\nfor her Lee Court home in 2022 \u2014 along with $1.4 million for an adjacent parcel \u2014 setting the record for a home sale price in Burr Ridge, according to listing services. She\nlisted the home for sale\nin a private network in September, asking $7.2 million.\nTwo other homes in Burr Ridge are asking more than $4 million. A 13,900-square-foot estate with a stone facade and terracotta roof hit the market in July and is now asking $5.7 million. A 9,300-square-foot \u201cgentleman\u2019s farm\u201d with grandfathered horse rights on 7.6 acres is\nasking $10 million\n, which would mark a record for the suburb if it fetches that price.\nThe $1 million drop from the Lee Court home\u2019s initial asking price could be a sign those homes will need to cut their ask to find buyers. But Murillo said Tuesday\u2019s sale bodes well for those other properties, showing a sign that buyers are interested and inventory is dwindling.\n\u201cWith confidence in the luxury market and so few options available, it\u2019s really only a matter of time before those homes go under contract,\u201d he said.\n",

        "content": "Oak Brook-based commercial real estate giant Inland Real Estate Group is going through another leadership shakeup.\nMatthew Fries, formerly of financial services and wealth management firm Cetera Financial Group, was named CEO of Inland Investments, a Tuesday press release said. Inland Investments is the arm of the Inland Real Estate Group that serves retail investors.\nFries will be the fourth person to hold the position since early 2024. He will be in charge of the company\u2019s public and private investment platforms and retail investor-focused offerings. In his prior role, Fired served as Cetera\u2019s head of investment products.\nHe will take over for Inland Investments\u2019 interim CEO Ella Neyland and will report to Tony Chereso, who is CEO of the Inland family of companies, known collectively as Inland Real Estate Group, according to the release.\nNeyland will remain in a leadership role as CEO of the Inland REIT, IPC Alternative Real Estate Income Trust.\nNeyland stepped in as interim CEO of Inland Investments when its former CEO, Keith D. Lampi, resigned in October. Lampi had been with the company since 2001 and held the position of Inland Investments CEO for nearly two years.\nIt\u2019s unclear why Lampi left the company, although SEC filings indicate his resignation was \u201cnot due to any disagreement with the company, its advisor or any of its and their affiliates,\u201d the filing read.\nDuring Lampi\u2019s tenure, Inland Real Estate Group restructured much of its executive ranks to consolidate operations among Inland Private Capital Corporation (the company\u2019s tax-deferred investment arm), Inland Venture Partners (the company\u2019s private equity arm), and Inland Securities Corporation (the company\u2019s dealer manager for Inland investment vehicles). The effort was part of Lampi\u2019s long-term vision for the company, a prior press release stated.\nLampi had taken over the Inland Investments CEO position from Mitchell Sabshon\n, a longtime Inland executive who retired in early 2024. Around the same time, Inland Real Estate Group co-founder and CEO\nDaniel Goodwin\ndied and was succeeded by Chesero.\nA month prior to that, co-founder and CEO of Inland\u2019s acquisitions arm,\nJoseph Cosenza\n, died as well. He was succeeded by his son Mark Cosenza and longtime Inland executive Matthew Tice.\nThe Inland family of companies is one of the country\u2019s largest real estate investment firms with $125 billion in transactions since its founding in 1968. It currently employs over 1,200 people and operates in 49 states, according to its website.\nNew York-based DRA Advisors acquired a huge Inland business line in 2016, when it assumed the firm\u2019s 132-property, $2.3 billion real estate portfolio concentrated on Midwest shopping centers, which operated under the IRC Retail Centers banner.\nDRA\nover the last few years has shed a notable portion of the Midwest portfolio\n, worth an estimated $540 million.",

        "content": "The day before Christmas Eve, Meyer Chetrit\u2019s interests in two holding companies were quietly auctioned off.\nThe highest bidder was an entity of\naggressive lender Maverick Real Estate Partners\n. The affiliate had foreclosed on Chetrit, won a $132 million judgment, and had set about getting paid by garnishing and auctioning Chetrit\u2019s assets.\nThe result is the latest in Chetrit\u2019s ongoing financial decline and legal battles and reveals the playbook of Maverick, which seemingly aims to take Chetrit\u2019s interests for itself on the cheap, under the auspices of an auction.\nThe Christmas week auction is the second in the ongoing legal saga between Maverick and Chetrit. At the\nfirst auction,\na representative for Maverick traded bids with Meyer Chetrit\u2019s brother Juda, who co-heads the Chetrit Organization.\nBut the second time around, it appears there were no bids traded because no one showed up. Court memos and affirmations from both Maverick\u2019s counsel and the city marshal responsible for the auction detailed the participants and spectators at the first auction, but their documents refer to no attendees, other than Maverick\u2019s affiliate, at the second.\nAt its own auction, Maverick bought Chetrit\u2019s interest in an LLC called CF Jamaica. The entity, through a series of other companies, controls a 16-story residential building at 152-01 and 150-13 88th Avenue in Jamaica.\nThe property is worth about $150 million but tied to about $285 million in debt, according to court documents filed by Chetrit\u2019s legal team. Chetrit allegedly received no income\nThe other entity Maverick won was called 90-100 Trinity Holder. The company is likely linked to the Chetrits\u2019 90 and 100 Trinity Place in Manhattan\u2019s Financial District, two 10- and 15-story buildings. It\u2019s unclear the level of control or interest Meyer Chetrit personally has in the property.\nIt\u2019s hardly surprising that these auctions should see few attendees. The auctions are little advertised. The city marshal\u2019s handbook requires that public auctions be advertised the day-of in a newspaper. There are no requirements that auctions be marketed online.\nAnd they are scheduled seemingly on the fly. Six days before the auction, a spokesperson for Fox Rothschild, the law firm representing Maverick and the host of the first auction, said no date had been set yet for another. The Department of Investigation, which oversees the city marshals, similarly said days before that it was unaware of any scheduled auctions in the case.\nMarshal Martin Bienstock, the city marshal hired by Maverick to run the ostensibly public auction, declined to answer questions about the value of the winning bid or whether anyone besides Maverick participated in the auction. Neither Maverick nor Matthew Schenker, a lawyer for the affiliate with Fox Rothschild, responded to a request for comment.\nChetrit had made a legal attempt to stop the auctions but had been turned down by a judge.\n",

The initial phase would clear portions of the site to make way for roughly 43,900 square feet of new retail space, revamped parking and open areas designed to host community events.\nThe move follows a rough stretch for the center, which has lost several high-profile tenants in recent years, including the original\nGoose Island Beer\nbrewpub\n, Patagonia and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.\nCRM\nfirst outlined its broader vision for the property \u2014 dubbed the Willow Street District \u2014 in May 2024.\nAt the time, the firm said the site could ultimately support an apartment building of up to 500 units on the southwest corner of the property. That housing component remains conceptual. CRM principal Jeff Malk said the company\u2019s near-term focus is on demolition and reconfiguration of buildings along Clybourn and Sheffield avenues and Willow Street. Any residential phase would require a zoning change, and its timing and scope have not yet been determined.\nFor now, CRM is betting on retail. It has tapped Savills brokers Todd Siegel, Phil Golding and Kimberly Wiskup to lease the new space, which would represent a relatively rare infusion of large-format retail availability in Lincoln Park. Individual spaces could reach up to 9,500 square feet.\nCRM is pitching the project as a natural extension of the nearby Armitage Avenue shopping corridor, which has thrived in recent years just a few blocks east. The firm is emphasizing walkability paired with on-site parking, aiming to draw both neighborhood foot traffic and shoppers arriving by car.\nMost of the new retail would rise north of Willow Street, which currently splits the shopping center. The redevelopment will also preserve pieces of the site\u2019s industrial past, incorporating masonry towers that date back to a former William D. Gibson Company spring plant, later a Turtle Wax factory, before the property\u2019s conversion to retail.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The campus will serve approximately 1,000 undergraduate and graduate students and have permanent faculty and staff.\nNews\nsurfaced last year\nthat Vanderbilt was\nlooking for a place to set up shop\nin San Francisco, reportedly\neyeing the 5M mixed-use project\nin South of Market.

        "content": "Aimco shielded its record\n$520 million\nsale of a Brickell development site from roughly $5.5 million in state taxes and a county surtax usually levied for property sales.\nBy not recording a deed, the Denver-based firm sidestepped about $3.12 million in Florida documentary stamp taxes and $2.34 million in a Miami-Dade County surtax, both of which primarily fund affordable housing, the South Florida Business Journal\nreported\nbased on calculations of the tax rates. The seller, which is the one on the hook for the taxes, pressed for doing the deal without a deed.\nThe publication was unable to reach Aimco, led by Wes Powell, for comment.\nThe publicly traded real estate investment trust that primarily buys and develops apartments announced in November its plan for a\nvoluntary dissolution\n, amid a slower multifamily market. Aimco has been selling off its assets over the past year and listed its Brickell assemblage in 2024 for about\n$650 million\n.\nLast month, Vlad Doronin\u2019s Miami-based OKO Group and Oak Row Equities, with offices in Miami and New York, bought the 32-story Brickell Bay Office Tower at 1001 Brickell Bay Drive and the adjacent 31-story, 357-unit Yacht Club Apartments at 1111 Brickell Bay Drive from Aimco. Mariposa Real Estate, tied to the Franklin family\u2019s Miami-based Mariposa Capital, partnered on the purchase.\nThe buyers took out a $464.5 million loan for the purchase from Tyko Capital. The financing was recorded in Miami-Dade records, and the borrowers were the same entities that Aimco used to own the sites for years, but with Oak Row\u2019s Erik Rutter signing the loans on behalf of the borrowers. Rutter leads Oak Row with David Weitz.\nThis signifies that Aimco sold the properties through a transfer of the ownership interest in the limited liability companies it used to own the sites. The practice is legal and sporadically used, though the Brickell deal is the biggest known South Florida sale closed without recording a deed and paying state and county taxes.\nThe Brickell assemblage sale is the biggest urban land site deal in South Florida history, and likely in the state.\nOKO Group\nand\nOak Row\nplan a hotel and branded condos for the first phase of their project. As a whole, the site can be developed with multiple supertalls with more than 3 million square feet. For now, it has two income-producing properties.\n\u2013\u2013\nLidia Dinkova\n",

The famed developer has been trying to sell the Hamptons estate with little luck for nearly two years.\nOne of the impediments to a sale has been the lack of a certificate of occupancy, needed for a resident to actually live there. East Hampton Village officials have accused Macklowe of illegal land clearing and unpermitted additions that jeopardized the surrounding wetlands. The ensuing drama created a need for an updated certificate of occupancy before somebody could live in the home.\nDouglas Elliman listing brokers Paul Brennan and Martha Gundersen claim there is a \u201cclear path\u201d towards\nresolving the dispute\nand picking up the certificate. The developer agreed to revegetate with low-lying plants and remove a patio. He\u2019ll also need to pay the fines he\u2019s racked up from the village.\nThat should open the door for a certificate of occupancy, though the timeline will be contingent on the cooperation of the weather to allow the revegetation work.\nOnce listed\nfor $38 million\n, the property\u2019s ask was dropped down to $32.5 million, or $5,909 per square foot, in the midst of the dispute.\nMacklowe paid\n$10.4 million\nfor the home in 2017, using it as a residence with his then-girlfriend, Patricia Landeau \u2014 now wife \u2014 during his\nnasty split from Linda Macklowe\n.\nThe 5,500-square-foot home features four bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms. Futterman Architects designed the home, which includes a waterfront gunite pool and is abutted by Georgica Pond.\nIt is just a stone\u2019s throw from the 9,000-square-foot home Macklowe shared with his ex-wife. That home was listed in 2019 for\n$21 million\n, but Linda ultimately decided to hang on to the pad.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "On his first day in office, Mayor Zohran Mamdani signed three housing-related executive orders.\nOne relaunched the Office to Protect Tenants, which was created by Mayor Bill de Blasio but\nhollowed out\nby the last administration. Another sought to speed up housing construction, while the other focused on opportunities to build housing on public land.\nLeila Bozorg, the newly-appointed deputy mayor of housing and planning, said the orders lay the groundwork for what\u2019s to come.\n\u201cI think the executive orders that we put out on day one of the administration really show that comprehensive approach that we want to take,\u201d she said during an interview this week. \u201cWe\u2019re not just going to be focused on continuing to build on our housing supply challenges, but also coupling that with important perspectives and tools to protect tenants.\u201d\nAs Mamdani\u2019s housing czar, Bozorg will play a major role in shaping the mayor\u2019s housing plan, building on her work with the previous administration while taking a more aggressive approach to tenant protections.\nBozorg most recently served as Mayor Eric Adams\u2019\nexecutive director\nof housing, where she worked extensively on zoning changes under the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity. She also served on the mayor\u2019s Charter Revision Commission, which presented voters with four\nhousing-related ballot measures\n, including three that created different avenues for project approvals. Before that, she served on the City Planning Commission and was chief of strategy and policy at nonprofit NYC Kids RISE.\nShe also previously was chief of staff to two former commissioners of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, as well as a senior policy advisor at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development during the Obama administration.\nThe Real Deal\ncaught up with Bozorg this week to speak about the new role and the administration\u2019s early actions.\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.\nWhat are your top priorities in this new role?\nI am really going to be focused on building off the foundation of work that I\u2019ve done in my career over the past 15 years to make sure that we are using every tool at our disposal to address our housing crisis, and in this administration, building new tools.\nWhat kind of new tools are you looking at?\nI\u2019m really interested in building off the work that HPD has been doing, not only to build 100 percent affordable housing but [to develop] new, mixed-income tools that allow us to build both market-rate and affordable housing. Especially given the mayor\u2019s ambitious goals to create 200,000 new affordable units, we\u2019re going to have to come up with new, mixed-income strategies to be able to scale to that level of affordable production. We\u2019ll also be looking to work closely with NYCHA, build[ing] on the work that they\u2019ve been doing through\nPACT\n, but also to reposition some of their campuses to do affordable\ninfills\nalong with building off the work at the\nPreservation Trust\n.\nWhat is your role in helping the mayor deliver on some of his key campaign promises, including the promise to freeze rents on stabilized apartments for the next four years?\nA huge part of my role right now is going to be helping to identify and appoint new members to the Rent Guidelines Board. It\u2019s ultimately going to be up to the board to decide whether it\u2019s appropriate for a rent freeze. But we\u2019re confident that when you look at the various elements that the board has to take into consideration, they\u2019ll find that a rent freeze is appropriate, through the process of both looking at data, taking testimony and looking at the economic conditions that tenants are facing.\nIn addition, we really need to build out our preservation strategies supporting distressed buildings, including distressed rent-stabilized buildings. We want to be looking at different programs to help bring down operating costs. The issue of insurance costs going up is something we\u2019re looking closely at, and whether there\u2019s any public sector tools we can bring to the table to address those types of growing costs. And the mayor has also stated that he\u2019s interested in taking a look at our property tax system, which ultimately creates some of the kind of inequitable outcomes that have created distress in the rent-stabilized stock.\nWhen searching for rent board candidates, are you looking for people who are more amenable to a rent freeze? You said it\u2019s ultimately up to the board to decide, but the mayor\u2019s pledge wasn\u2019t qualified in that way during the campaign.\nThere\u2019s a number of requirements that board members have to meet to be qualified to be on the board. We\u2019ll be looking to make sure anyone that\u2019s appointed is qualified to analyze these issues comprehensively, as required by law.\nHow are you thinking about the role of the Office to Protect Tenants, especially in terms of taking over distressed buildings?\nThere\u2019s going to be a lot of things that the office is focused on, not just on distressed properties or the case of bad landlords that need to be held more accountable, but also the types of services that need to be available to tenants and working better for tenants or the types of services that are often available but siloed across government.\nThe city actually [has] a lot of examples of intervening in distressed multifamily properties and helping facilitate preservation purchases. That\u2019s a huge chunk of work that HPD does every day, facilitating preservation transactions so that buildings can be on a better financial foundation and get rehab. The tools already exist, but we\u2019re one week in, and at the early stages of thinking about whether there are gaps in that toolbox that we need to develop for the distressed stock.\nAre you concerned that the housing regulation bills\nvetoed\nby Mayor Eric Adams might be revived by the City Council?\nI\u2019m really excited to be working with the new City Council and with Speaker Julie Menin to advance shared housing goals. And yes, we\u2019ve voiced some concerns about a number of the bills that were vetoed by the last administration, particularly when it comes to the impact that some of those bills may have on the cost of housing production, or how much we can be producing with the limited resources that we have. It remains to be seen whether the Council will override those vetoes, but I have full faith that we have a lot of shared goals and that we\u2019ll be able to work together to address the affordable housing challenge.\nThe last administration did not veto the Construction Justice Act, which established minimum wages for construction workers on certain projects. Do you have a sense of how that\u2019s going to affect the city\u2019s ability to impact city-financed housing going forward?\nIt\u2019s a\nbill\nwe support and look forward to working with the laborers and others to ensure that, as we\u2019re building, people are paid a livable and fair wage.\n(The Adams administration warned that this measure would be the costliest of the housing measures.)\nDo you expect landlords to participate in the\nRental Ripoff\nhearings?\nWe want to be hearing from everybody, including landlords, about the types of issues and conditions that tenants are facing, or maybe the types of unscrupulous fees that they\u2019re facing, but we also want to hear the experiences that landlords and property managers are faced with as well. For too long, we\u2019ve been a bit disconnected from real people\u2019s voices. We\u2019re really aiming to bring New Yorkers into the policy-making process very early on in the administration, so that we can hear from them directly as we\u2019re developing the housing plan and creating a baseline for new housing policy.\nThere are some people in the real estate industry who see the\nearly actions\nof the administration as anti-landlord. How do you think about balancing the push for more tenant protections while also encouraging development of housing by the private sector?\nWe really have to be able to do multiple things at once. We have to be aggressive in addressing our housing supply challenges. That\u2019s why two of the\nexecutive orders\nwere really focused on finding sites for more housing and speeding up the development process. This mayor very much recognizes that we have a housing shortage and wants to be incredibly aggressive on the development front, so we\u2019ll remain a pro-development administration. At the same time, yes, there\u2019s going to be a focus on ensuring we can do that while also protecting tenants. That\u2019s critical for a city like ours, where we have a 1.4 percent vacancy rate. It\u2019s incredibly hard to find housing, and that\u2019s created an uneven playing field for tenants across the whole city.\nWhat do you want to see happen at the Elizabeth Street Garden site, where the last administration abandoned plans for senior housing?\nWe\u2019ll have to take a close look at the\nactions\nthat the last administration made at the very end of the administration, and evaluate the kind of cost and benefit of trying to move forward on the site.\nDoes the city plan to step in or help other portfolios in similar situations as the\nPinnacle\nbuildings?\nWe have a history of supporting preservation of projects that are in physical and financial distress. A large part of HPD work focuses on repositioning properties that are facing both physical or financial distress. We have a number of tools, but we\u2019ll be evaluating case-by-case on what our options are to support buildings and the tenants that live in them.\n",

        "content": "Eric Adams is out of office, but allegations of corruption continue to dog his administration.\nFederal prosecutors indicted Tony Herbert on corruption charges, The City\nreported\n. Herbert allegedly demanded kickbacks from vendors in exchange for city contracts while the Adams associate served as a liaison between City Hall and NYCHA.\nProsecutors allege Herbert shook down a firm seeking a contract to perform security services at NYCHA developments. Herbert allegedly ghostwrote a letter to an unidentified aide to get the security firm pre-qualified as a minority-owned business. He allegedly took a $3,500 bribe from the security firm in 2024.\nLaw enforcement tapped on the security firm\u2019s owner to cooperate in their probe, leading to recorded conversations and saved messages. Texts even allegedly show Herbert communicating with Adams about the need for more security at NYCHA developments, without disclosing the alleged scheme, according to court filings.\nThe vendor did not land the contract.\nHerbert also allegedly took kickbacks from a funeral home director trying to get involved in subsidizing funeral services for low-income residents. Herbert appeared to receive a $6,000 check from the funeral home, referenced in a memo as \u201creferrals.\u201d\nAdditionally, Herbert allegedly defrauded the federal government out of a $20,000 Paycheck Protection Plan loan for a nonexistent bakery.\nIt all came to an end in September 2024, according to prosecutors, on the day the FBI and Department of Investigation seized the phones of multiple senior aides to Adams.\nHerbert \u201cvehemently denies wrongdoing,\u201d his attorney said on Tuesday following his arraignment. He faces up to 20 years in prison for the most serious charges.\nThe federal prosecutor\u2019s office involved in Herbert\u2019s indictment is the same one that launched a bribery and campaign finance case against Adams. The former mayor\u2019s indictment was ultimately\ndismissed\nby the Justice Department as he grew more cooperative with the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown, arguably costing Adams a second term.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Uncommon Developers\nis tweaking its plans for an apartment building in Hollywood.\nThe Chatsworth-based development firm has\nbeefed up\nits proposal for apartments at 7441 Sunset Boulevard, Urbanize Los Angeles reported.\nA new application filed with the Los Angeles Department of City Planning calls for the construction of a 15-story building with 143 one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments above parking for 143 vehicles and 3,585 square feet of ground-floor commercial space. That\u2019s more than double the height of the previously proposed building, which would have risen seven stories with 123 apartments above ground-floor commercial space and subterranean parking. The new\nplan\n, like the old one, calls for demolishing a commercial building to make way for the residences.\nThe Department of City Planning recently terminated Uncommon\u2019s entitlement application for the seven-story building, saying the developer wasn\u2019t making progress with the project. Uncommon reportedly was working on a larger project at the site instead. The new application utilizes\ndensity bonus\nincentives, which would allow construction larger than what zoning rules normally allow in exchange for designating 18 apartments for rent by very-low-income households. In Los Angeles County, an individual\nmaking\n$53,000 or less annually qualifies as very-low-income, while a household of four must make less than $75,750.\nUncommon recently made a similar pivot in Beverly Grove. Last month, it abandoned its plans for a midrise building at 7959 Beverly Boulevard and instead\nfiled\na new application for a 15-story tower, Urbanize Los Angeles reported. The company has other developments in the works including an under-construction\n405-unit apartment complex in Van Nuys\nand a proposed 12-story apartment tower near the University of California, Los Angeles, campus in Westwood.\nUncommon\u2019s proposed Hollywood project would be built across the street from\nGreystar\n\u2019s new\nRae on Sunset\napartment building, which also features retail below 200 apartments.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Time Out Market is bowing out of Chicago\u2019s West Loop, closing its Fulton Market space less than six years after opening it as an early entrant in the city\u2019s upscale food hall boom.\nThe 50,000-square-foot Time Out Market Chicago at 916 West Fulton Street will shutter Jan. 23, the company confirmed in a statement released Thursday morning. Time Out CEO Michael Marlay cited uneven foot traffic tied to hybrid work patterns and rising operating costs as obstacles to profitability, even as Chicago\u2019s broader recovery has gained steam, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\n\u201c[Foot traffic] until today remains inconsistent in the area due to ongoing hybrid working and in addition, operating costs have increased \u2014 all of which prevents consistent profitability,\u201d Marlay said in the statement.\nThe closure affects more than a dozen local food operators, many of which run their only physical space or a key outpost inside the market. Some vendors had signed leases just months ago, highlighting the whiplash facing small operators that bet on\nFulton Market\u2019s\ncontinued momentum.\nThe building\u2019s owners are already lining up a second act. The building was purchased in 2023 for nearly $36 million by a venture of Luxembourg-based Lagfin, the holding company tied to the Italian billionaire family that owns Campari Group.\nLagfin\npartnered with Chicago developer\nR2\nto manage the food hall, and R2 will now help reposition or re-lease the space.\nR2 CEO Matt Garrison told the outlet that ownership is exploring a broad range of options, from another food-and-beverage concept to experiential or flagship retail uses, and that discussions with potential users are already underway.\nTime Out Market opened in 2019, staking out a prime corner of Fulton Market as the district was cresting as Chicago\u2019s hottest mixed-use neighborhood. But the\npandemic-era shift\nin office usage and rising labor and operating costs have battered food halls nationwide. Chicago has already seen several retrenchments, particularly downtown.\nThe situation mirrors the shakeup at\nRevival Food Hall\nin the Loop. Revival announced its closure in July 2024, only for a new operator to step in within weeks and keep the space running under a different banner.\nTime Out Market still operates in 10 cities globally, though\nlocal outlets\nin Boston reported that market is also closing, suggesting broader pressure on the brand\u2019s U.S. portfolio.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Summit Properties is on a mission to\npurchase 5,200 mostly rent-stabilized New York apartments\nat a bankruptcy auction.\nBut there\u2019s been a thorn in its side: the Mamdani administration, which has filed\nnumerous\nobjections\nto the auction and sale, generating paperwork and press.\nNow, Summit is trying to get the city off its back. In a declaration filed Wednesday, Summit CEO Zohar Levy outlined a plan to fix the bankrupt properties.\nSummit appears poised to be confirmed as the buyer in a Thursday morning bankruptcy hearing. If confirmed, it would foil attempts by the city and renters to find a more tenant-focused buyer. But the declaration also illustrates that New York\u2019s big landlords are living in a new reality, one where the mayor will personally make private transactions a political issue, and hope to extract concessions for tenants where it can.\nIn the declaration, Levy laid out a management structure and timeline to address housing code violations at the properties, seeming to reply directly to city filings arguing the company won\u2019t be able to fix up the properties.\nTenants and the city have cast Pinnacle, the owner who placed the buildings in bankruptcy, as a slumlord, given the portfolio\u2019s nearly 7,000 housing code violations.\nBut Levy says violations in the portfolio appear to be incredibly concentrated. Only 420 of the 5,200 units in the portfolio have documented violations, he wrote, representing just 8% of units.\nLevy outlined a plan to divide the violation-ridden buildings between two management companies. Resources will be prioritized for the Brooklyn portion of the portfolio, which comprises less than half the units but more than 60 percent of the violations.\nSummit plans to spend $30 million over five years on capital expenditures for the portfolio, with $10 million required in the first year to fix existing violations and a maintenance backlog. That works out to about $1,940 per unit in the first year and $5,824 over five years.\nSome of the open violations are, however, immediately hazardous, including vermin infestations and lead paint violations.\nLevy said Summit plans to address half the violations in the first 60 days and the remaining in 180 days. About 13 percent of violations are related to vermin infestations and 20 percent are related to paint and plaster. Others relate to general repairs, lead paint and water.\nAbout 15 percent of the violations are in apartments Pinnacle says it hasn\u2019t been able to access. Levy said Summit is prepared to work with the city to get access to the units.\nThe filing also revealed that Flagstar Bank, the biggest creditor in the bankruptcy, has agreed to finance up to 75 percent of Summit\u2019s $451.3 million bid. The arrangement will lower the mortgage debt on the portfolio by $275 million and lower the interest rate.\nThe mayor\u2019s office, which has objected to the sale in part because of the lack of plan from Summit, declined to comment on the declaration.\nBut the Union of Pinnacle Tenants, representing tenants at the properties, said Summit is trying to diminish the scale of neglect across the portfolio. The city\u2019s housing arm hasn\u2019t been able to complete roof-to-cellar inspections of every unit up for sale, and Summit would be required by law to address the most serious violations within 24 hours, the union said.\nSummit\u2019s existing portfolio already contains more than 5,000 open violations and has earned it a place on the public advocate\u2019s \u201cWorst Landlord\u201d list, tenants said.\n\u201cThe violations recorded are almost certainly an undercount,\u201d the union said of Pinnacle\u2019s portfolio in a statement. \u201cThe judge should look at [Summit\u2019s] documented history of neglect, not unenforceable promises.\u201d\nThe city along with tenants have asked the judge to reject the sale. They\u2019ve raised concerns about Summit\u2019s stewardship, financial ability to invest in the properties at the sale price, and also suggested more time would allow for a tenant-focused buyer to bid.\nFlagstar Bank, to whom the Pinnacle portfolio owes $564 million, also objected to that formally in a separate declaration. The city\u2019s argument that the sale price of about $88,000 per unit is too high, the bank said, is antithetical to the goals of the bankruptcy process.\n\u201cIt is also not the approach of a party that believes, and is ready to invest, in the properties,\u201d Flagstar wrote. \u201cIn the end, it appears that the City\u2019s real objective is to scuttle the Sale Transaction so that it has more time to come up with a competing bid for significantly less money.\u201d\n",

The financing will fund the redevelopment and expansion of the Hell\u2019s Kitchen property, which is slated to deliver 316 apartments spread across two towers.\nYellowstone purchased the leasehold interest at the Watson along with the existing mortgage from HSBC\nin 2021 for $175 million\n, after Richard Born and Ira Drukier\u2019s\nBD Hotels defaulted\non the debt the year before.\nBut the project has been slow to move forward. During the pandemic, the 600-key Watson shuttered to traditional guests and was instead used by the city as a migrant shelter amid an influx of asylum seekers. Mayor Eric Adams said last year that the shelter would close by the start of the summer, clearing the way for redevelopment.\nYellowstone filed updated plans with the Department of Buildings this summer, calling for two residential towers and a parking garage in the cellar. Amenities will include an entertainment lounge, gaming room, pet playroom, fitness center and indoor swimming pool. The hotel\u2019s existing rooftop outdoor pool will remain as part of the redevelopment, per the filing.\nThe Watson conversion is the latest in a growing list of Manhattan repositionings by Hera, whose firm has leaned into adaptive reuse as office and hotel distress has mounted. Yellowstone is also pursuing a 422-unit office-to-residential conversion at 1730 Broadway, a Midtown West building it bought from Blackstone last year for $185.9 million.\nHera declined to comment.\n",

        "content": "Michael Swerdlow wants rival developer Don Peebles jailed over a four-year-old unpaid $800,000 judgment.\nIn a Jan. 7 motion, an entity managed by Swerdlow, who leads Coconut Grove-based Swerdlow Group, wants Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Thomas Rebull to find\nPeebles\nof criminal contempt outside the courtroom. Peebles should be \u201cincarcerated\u201d if Rebull concludes the founder of Miami Beach-based The Peebles Corporation violated a post-judgment court order issued in May, Swerdlow\u2019s motion states.\nThe $800,000 represents legal fees and costs Swerdlow won against Peebles in 2022 tied to their long-running legal battle over a land deal for in Overtown. Swerdlow and his partners SJM and Alben Duffie bought the 3.4-acre property at 249 Northwest Sixth Street for\n$10 million\nin 2020. The same year, two\nPeebles entities\nsued Swerdlow, his affiliate and Duffie for allegedly sabotaging Peebles\u2019 involvement in the land deal.\nFour years later, the joint venture completed Block 55 at Sawyer\u2019s Walk, a mixed-use center featuring 578 senior affordable housing apartments and a 251,000-square-foot office and retail center anchored by Target and Aldi stores.\nMichael Higer, an attorney representing Peebles and two of his entities, dismissed the allegations in Swerdlow\u2019s recent motion. \u201cWe believe it is completely frivolous,\u201d Higer said.\nSwerdlow and his legal team declined comment. In a 2024 interview with\nThe Real Deal\n, the developer blasted Peebles\u2019 lawsuit. \u201c[The allegations] were so ridiculous that the judge threw out every one of them on summary judgment,\u201d\nhe said\nat the time. \u201cNobody thought [Peebles] had a chance.\u201d\nPeebles dissolved the two entities that owe the $800,000 judgment in August, state corporate records show. In doing so, he circumvented Rebull\u2019s May order placing the two entities under control of a receiver, and blocking him from taking any actions on behalf of the entities without court approval, Swerdlow\u2019s motion alleges.\nSwerdlow\u2019s request to have Peebles arraigned for criminal contempt carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail. Peebles\u2019 alleged end\u2011run around the receivership is the type of conduct that justifies criminal contempt sanctions to \u201cvindicate the authority and dignity of the court,\u201d Swerdlow\u2019s motion asserts.\nPeebles is known for getting into legal fights over government-owned sites he bids on. In January of last year, he and partner Victor MacFarlane sued the City of Los Angeles for allegedly unlawfully terminating their contract to build the\n$1.6 billion\nAngels Landing project Downtown. The project was billed as among the largest African-American-led developments in the city\u2019s history.\nSwerdlow is among the most active developers of government-owned sites in Miami-Dade County. His next big swing is the\n$3 billion Little River District\n, a 64-acre redevelopment that would blanket a nearly mile-long stretch between Miami neighborhoods Little River and Little Haiti. The plan, backed by a 99-year ground lease with Miami-Dade County, envisions roughly 5,700 units on a site assembled from county-owned land and parcels controlled by AJ Capital Partners.\nRoughly 314 apartments would be reserved for residents displaced from four public housing projects, while nearly 3,700 units would be set aside for households earning between 60 percent and 120 percent of the area median income. The first phase, recently cleared by federal housing officials, calls for two new buildings with 600 apartments, while future phases would add a Home Depot, a BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club, a supermarket and a new Tri-Rail station.",

The buyer borrowed $28.9 million from Israel Discount Bank of New York for the deal.\nCompleted in 2019, the 117,300-square-foot Edison consists of a three-story building and a one-story building on a 12.6-acre site, Vizzda records show. It last traded for $12.2 million in 2017, according to property records.\nEdison roughly 87 percent occupied, said Alejandro Velez, of Midtown Capital.\nTenants include insurance broker Lockton, MyHousingSearch and U.S. Immigration Law Counsel.\nMidtown Capital plans to hold the asset and eventually pursue an apartment project on this site and its adjacent property. Midtown also owns the nearly 145,000-square-foot Pembroke Pointe office building 880 Southwest 145th Avenue, immediately north of Edison.\nPembroke Pointe is fully leased, according to Velez. Tenants include Keller Williams Realty Partners SW.\nThe Edison and Pembroke Pointe sites give Midtown Capital a combined 23.6 acres of land.\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear if Midtown Capital would add the apartment buildings on the parking lots and keep the offices, or if it would pursue a total redevelopment.\nMidtown is ramping up its South Florida development activity. This month, it scored an\n$84 million\nconstruction loan to complete its 252-unit Astor Park Flagler Village apartment project with a pair of 12-story buildings in Fort Lauderdale\u2019s Flagler Village neighborhood. Construction completion is expected this summer.\nIn Plantation, Midtown also plans to add a\n300-unit apartment project\nwith some affordable housing on the parking lot of the Plantation Pointe office park. The site is at\u00a0 7510 West Sunrise Boulevard.\nDevelopers have seized upon\nsuburban office complexes\nin South Florida with plans for redevelopment, either adding apartments on the parking lots or replacing existing buildings. In Boca Raton, Pebb Enterprises and the Toledano family\u2019s BH Group are renovating two of the existing office buildings at the Office Depot headquarters campus. The pair is partnering with the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related Group to replace the third building with an\neight-story, 500-unit apartment project\n. The campus has been rechristened The Eclipse.\nConversions of existing office buildings into residential are rare in South Florida. The only known such project is Keystone Development + Investment\u2019s conversion of the properties at 9400 and 9500 South Dadeland Boulevard in Kendall\u2019s Dadeland area into\n212 apartments\n.\n",

        "content": "The head of one of Dallas\u2019 most recognizable luxury brokerages is putting his own money into the brand, making an equity investment in Allie Beth Allman &amp; Associates as the firm looks to double down on its local identity amid industry consolidation.\nKeith Conlon, the firm\u2019s president and CEO, acquired an ownership stake in the brokerage, marking an unusual move for a company owned by HomeServices of America, the real estate arm of Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway. The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat the financial terms were not disclosed.\nConlon said in a statement on Monday that the investment formalizes a long-term commitment to the\nfirm\nand positions it to retain top talent at a time when mergers, acquisitions and national rollups are reshaping the brokerage landscape.\nFounded in 1985 by Allie Beth Allman, the firm was acquired in 2015 by HomeServices, but has continued to operate under its original name and leadership. Allman stepped down as CEO in 2020 and tapped\nConlon\n, who joined the company in 2008, as her successor.\n\u201cThis is the first transaction of its kind for HomeServices,\u201d Conlon said, describing the deal as a chance to reintroduce a more \u201cgrassroots\u201d ownership mentality. He framed the move as a matter of both retention and recruiting, aimed at agents who want the feel of a locally owned shop without giving up the scale and support of a national platform.\nAllman praised the investment as a safeguard for the firm\u2019s legacy. In the statement, she said Conlon\u2019s buy-in ensures the brokerage\u2019s local roots remain intact, calling the move a natural extension of the succession plan she put in place five years ago.\nThe brokerage has thrived in recent years alongside North Texas\u2019 population boom and corporate migration wave. In 2024,\nAllie Beth Allman &amp; Associates\nclosed nearly $4 billion in residential sales volume, driven by 2,674 transactions. According to the publication, the firm ranked as the fourth-largest brokerage in Dallas-Fort Worth by sales volume, with 416 licensed agents that year.\nThe firm\u2019s name regularly appears on some of the region\u2019s priciest listings, including a University Park home that became Texas\u2019 most expensive publicly listed residential sale in 2025, asking $35 million. Its portfolio also includes marquee properties like the Knox Hotel &amp; Residences, the Mount Vernon estate on White Rock Lake and the\nRachofsky House\nin North Dallas.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The deal closed Jan. 8, with no price disclosed, the Dallas Business Journal first\nreported\n. The property had been marketed for $43.5 million.\nThe ranch sits about 50 miles west of\nFort Worth\nand roughly 18 miles outside\nWeatherford\n, which brands itself as the cutting horse capital of the world. TR9 is known nationally for its top-tier equestrian infrastructure and for housing National Cutting Horse Association Hall of Fame horses including Quintan Blue and Watch Me Whip, according to the publication. Teton Ridge ran a breeding and performance program out of the property during its ownership.\nTeton Ridge held the ranch for about four years and significantly expanded it, Icon Global associate broker\nDon Bell\ntold the outlet. The company grew the property from 618 acres to 860 acres, gutted older structures and built new facilities designed to handle multiple horse disciplines under one roof.\nThe\nranch\nincludes several indoor and outdoor performance arenas, cattle-handling systems, extensive barns and conditioning areas, along with spectator viewing spaces. Bell called it the premier horse training facility in Parker County, noting that it\u2019s rare for one property to accommodate cutting, reining and cow horse training due to differing arena and ground requirements.\nThe buyers operate Theorem Ranch, with holdings in Montana and a vineyard in Napa Valley. In August, the Itkins made headlines in the Western performance world by purchasing a $23 million cutting horse sire, Stevie Rey Von. Jason Itkin is a partner at Houston law firm Arnold &amp; Itkin, while Kisha Itkin has taken a visible role in shaping their ranching ventures.\nIn a social media post announcing the acquisition, Kisha Itkin said the couple plans to \u201cmaximize this ranch\u2019s potential\u201d and position it as a platform to help grow Western performance sports.\nBell said he initially expected the land would need to be sold off in tracts given the cost to operate a facility of that scale. Instead, the Itkins emerged as a rare buyer whose resources matched their ambition. Icon Global founder Bernard Uechtritz echoed that sentiment, pointing to a \u201cpinhole\u201d market for properties of this caliber.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",
