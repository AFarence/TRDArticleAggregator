        "content": "CC Homes paid $50 million for a development site in Davie planned for 151 single-family homes.\nCC Homes, led by Armando Codina and Jim Carr, bought the 152-acre vacant property on the northeast corner of I-75 and the Royal Palm Boulevard exit ramp. The seller is KBNP, an affiliate of Aventura-based Turnberry, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. Turnberry, led by Jackie Soffer, will partner on the project.\nDesigned by MSA+, the development will consist of 3,400-square-foot to 5,700-square-foot homes, with some reaching 6,000 square feet with added rooms. The lots will range from 20,000 square feet to 25,000 square feet.\nConstruction and home sales are expected to start this year, with base prices ranging from $1.6 million to $1.8 million, Carr told\nThe Real Deal\nin June.\nThe project, called Estates by Turnberry, marks a redesign of Turnberry\u2019s proposal over a decade ago for 2 million square feet of offices and retail, plus a hotel.\nThe Davie Planning &amp; Zoning Board approved CC Homes\u2019 project on April 8, and the town council preliminarily approved it on May 7. The council\u2019s final vote of\napprova\nl was on May 21.\nThe council also approved a community development district for the project. Developers use CDDs to help pay for infrastructure needed for large projects, including water and sewer connections, roads and sidewalks. Generally,\nCDDs\nissue bonds and then levy assessments on homebuyers to pay back the bonds.\nDavie Mayor Judy Paul said at the May 7 town council meeting that she had cast the only \u2018no\u2019 vote against a previously proposed \u201cmassive shopping center\u201d on the site, likely a reference to Turnberry\u2019s project.\n\nTurnberry\u2019s previously planned development, called Davie Commons, fizzled out after KBNP bought the\n$17.4 million\nmortgage Turnberry had on the land in 2012. The previous lender, KeyBank, had filed a foreclosure on the loan.\nKBNP is tied to Jackie Soffer and reportedly also to New York investors.\nCC Homes\n, based in Coral Gables, was formed at least 15 years ago by Codina and Carr.\nCodina\nis founder of Coral Gables-based Codina Partners, which he leads with his daughter Ana-Marie Codina. Codina Partners is a major South Florida developer, with completed projects including the Downtown Doral mixed-use development in Doral and Beacon Logistics Park in Hialeah.\nCarr\nfounded land development and homebuilding firm Westbrooke Communities in 1976. After selling it to Pacific USA Holdings in 1998, he remained Westbrooke\u2019s president and CEO until 2001. Carr formed multifamily and urban infill development firm Carr Residential I in 2001, according to CC Homes\u2019 website.\nCC Homes recently completed\nPine Rockland Estates\nwith 26 single-family homes at Southwest 72nd Street near Coral Gables. The community is sold out, according to CC Homes\u2019 website.\nAlso in\nDavie\n, Hollywood-based BSD Capital paid\n$16 million\nin July for a 4.8-acre development site at 4491 South State Road 7, with plans for The Core, consisting of a pair of 24-story buildings with 744 apartments, 51,000 square feet of retail and 29,000 square feet of offices.\nCoconut Grove-based 13th Floor Investments and Miami Beach-based JSB Capital Group scored a\n$67.5 million\nconstruction loan in March for a 383-unit apartment complex with some workforce apartments on the northwest corner of Davie Road and Southwest 37th Street in Davie.\n",

        "content": "Longtime North Shore agent Peter Cummins jumped from @properties to Baird &amp; Warner to lead a new team, blasting his old firm\u2019s parent Compass and its push for office exclusives as a major reason for the move.\nHis leap underscores tension between corporate-owned brokerages and local firms as Compass \u2014 @properties\u2019 parent company following its\n$444 million acquisition\nthis year \u2014 seeks to grow its market share and transform the residential real estate industry. Compass announced Sept. 22 it\nplans to acquire Anywhere Real Estate\n, its next-biggest competitor. Anywhere includes brands like Coldwell Banker, Century 21 and Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\nCummins joined Baird &amp; Warner about five weeks ago, he said, before Compass announced its plan to acquire Anywhere. But he said his opposition to Compass\u2019 business model was a major factor in his decision to jump to Baird &amp; Warner, a family-owned brokerage. He said he supports a model where listings are shared freely between agents instead of brokerages holding pocket listings marketed only internally.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a part of that,\u201d Cummins said in an interview of Compass\u2019 marketing strategy. \u201cBecause I think it\u2019s contrary to everything I\u2019ve ever learned and been exposed to.\u201d\nCompass has pushed for a three-phase marketing strategy, in which some listings start out as Compass exclusives marketed only to fellow Compass agents. The company has argued the model gives sellers more freedom and privacy and helps them test pricing before their house hits the open market, where statistics such as number of days listed and price cuts are publicly tracked and, according to some, stigmatize certain offerings.\nCummins has more than $500 million in career sales, and said he averaged $20 million to $30 million in annual transaction volume over the last few years. Cummins joined @properties in 2010, and has developed real estate on the North Shore. Before getting into real estate, he worked as assistant city manager in Lake Forest and the village manager of Lake Bluff and Glencoe.\nCummins will lead a new team, Cummins Advisors, at Baird &amp; Warner. He previously did not have a team at @properties. Cummins said he\u2019s planning to bring together three to five agents for his team, including his son, Liam Cummins.\nCummins spoke positively of his experiences at @properties and the company\u2019s co-CEOs, Thad Wong and Mike Golden. But he said he doesn\u2019t support Compass\u2019 business model and wanted to join a brokerage that shared his philosophy of providing a transparent market for agents and consumers.\n\nBaird &amp; Warner has been an advocate of Clear Cooperation, a National Association of Realtors policy requiring agents to enter a listing in the MLS within 24 hours of publicly marketing it. @properties and Compass have\nopposed that policy\n, saying it limits options for agents and sellers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much the future of our industry that I care about,\u201d Cummins said. \u201cAnd I want to be a part of people who share that vision.\u201d\nBaird &amp; Warner president and CEO Steve Baird said in a previous interview with\nThe Real Deal\nthat he views Compass\u2019 consolidation and growing market share as an opportunity to differentiate his brokerage as an independent firm and potentially pick up some agents. Baird &amp; Warner acquired competitor Dream Town Real Estate this year, uniting the city\u2019s two largest\nindependent brokerages\n.\nA spokesperson for @properties declined to comment, and a Compass spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCompass CEO Robert Reffkin said in a call with investors after announcing the merger with Anywhere that the merger will help develop a \u201cunified operating system\u201d for residential real estate using Compass\u2019 vast network of agents. Some brokers, including Cummins, have speculated Compass may move to a model where users need to subscribe to see certain listings that aren\u2019t on the MLS or public listing services.\n\u201cReffkin\u2019s plan is to try to create a Compass profile that works like Amazon,\u201d Cummins said. \u201cAnd if you really want to see these listings before they come out for the world, you better be a part of Compass. And if you\u2019re a consumer, we\u2019re not necessarily going to give away that information for free.\u201d\nThe move also signals Baird &amp; Warner\u2019s expansion in the North Shore amid growing competition for the luxury lakefront market. Baird &amp; Warner has an office in Winnetka, but its presence on the North Shore is not as dominant as Compass and @properties, which hold a large share of the listings there.\nCompass recently sold five offices in the North Shore to\nJanice Corley\u2019s RE/MAX Premier\n, cutting down its brick-and-mortar presence in cities where @properties also has offices. It\u2019s unclear how many of the agents at those offices will move to RE/MAX Premier.\n\u201cThe North Shore in particular is a land of opportunity to do things right,\u201d Cummins said. \u201c And there\u2019s a ton of great agents who, I know, share this philosophy about doing what\u2019s best for the consumer.\u201d",

        "content": "The\nforeclosure auction block across Texas\nis usually crowded with dilapidated Class C apartment complexes, but that\u2019s not the case with this suburban Austin multifamily asset.\nCanada\u2019s largest private landlord is facing foreclosure on Emerson at Buda, built in 2021. The property, at 950 FM 2001, is scheduled to be auctioned after owner Starlight Investments defaulted on a $47.7 million loan from Natixis, according to a foreclosure notice.\nThe auction is scheduled for Oct. 17 at 10:30 a.m.\nThe Toronto-based firm bought the 304-unit property in April 2022. The mortgage works out to $157,000 per unit.\nEmerson at Buda is a garden-style community with a gym, pool, cabanas and co-working spaces. The property is about 16 miles south of downtown Austin in Buda, a fast-growing town of about 15,000 people in the Austin-San Antonio megaregion. Its population has grown more than 8 percent since 2020.\nA historic wave of apartment supply came online in Austin over the last two years, causing rental rates and occupancy levels to plummet.\n\nRents have fallen so much in Austin\nthat the city leads the country in rental affordability, JLL\u2019s Kai Pan said at a recent\nTexas multifamily conference\nhosted by Connect CRE. Decreased rents, paired with high salaries, mean Austin renters, on average, spend 16.8 percent of their income on rent.\nEmerson at Buda\u2019s website archives make it possible to track how the Austin rent rate rollercoaster affected the property.\nThree years ago, one-bedroom apartments at Emerson at Buda started at $1,238 per month. Today, those same units are starting at $1,019, a drop of almost 18 percent. Rates for two-bedroom units have dropped even more. They started at $1,598 three years ago, and are now being offered for $1,278, a reduction of 20 percent.\nEven with the price drops, the property is offering concessions: a $1,000 credit for renters who sign a lease for a one-bedroom apartment and one month free for those who rent a two-bedroom apartment.\nExperts warn Texas multifamily distress is just beginning. In the next five years, $19 billion in CMBS loans tied to Texas multifamily will mature, CWCapital\u2019s James Shevlin said.\n",

The outlet reported that CBRE brokered the deal.\nAT&amp;T will join Guidehouse at the Reserve, a consulting firm that leased 107,000 square feet there a year ago. The building was left vacant for about three years after Nationwide left the complex and sold it in 2021.\nThe announcement is another blow to downtown San Antonio\u2019s beleaguered office market. For over a year, the city\u2019s office vacancy rate has been stable at about 17 percent according to JLL. The downtown submarket, however, has seen\nvacancy rates as high as 27 percent\n. PwC, local insurance giant USAA and Visionworks have all recently parted ways with downtown for outer reaches of the city.\nThe move comes as AT&amp;T considers\na similar shift in Dallas\n.\n\nThe company currently leases 1.1 million-square-foot lease at the 37-story Whitacre Tower, at 208 South Akard Street in downtown Dallas. The lease ends in 2030, but AT&amp;T is pondering a move to the Dallas suburbs,\nmuch to the dismay of Dallas politicians\nwho say the massive vacancy left by AT&amp;T would be a catastrophic blow to the downtown office market.\nExecutives have been touring sites like the Park at Legacy in Plano, but the firm\u2019s plans remain unclear.\nAT&amp;T already picked up office space in Richardson\nearlier this year, inking a deal to occupy 186,000 square feet at Lakeside Boulevard Tower in Richardson. The company has said it plans to grow its Richardson workforce from 400 to up to 1,400.\nThe company has been headquartered in Dallas since 2008, when the firm exited San Antonio for North Texas.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

In May, a trust affiliated with Ares acquired the former Miami Herald headquarters in Doral for\n$25.9 million\n.\nThe seller of that property, Atlanta-based Panattoni Development, had begun demolishing the office building on the 9-acre site, but abandoned plans to redevelop the property into two warehouses spanning 153,653 square feet with 171 parking spaces. Ares paid $4 million less than Panattoni\u2019s purchase price last year.\nIn October, Ares dropped\n$147 million\nfor Midway Miami Park, a warehouse complex in Miami Lakes made up of four warehouses. The transaction was the fourth largest industrial deal in South Florida for 2024.\nAres is also partnering with Miami billionaire Jorge Mas and retired soccer star David Beckham to develop the $1 billion Miami Freedom Park, a massive mixed-use project in Miami, anchored by a new 25,000-seat home for Inter Miami Major League Soccer franchise. In April, the partnership scored a\n$450 million\nconstruction loan for the soccer stadium, which is nearly completed.\nAlso this year, Ares teamed up with Monarch Alternative Capital to provide a\n$413 million\nloan for One Twenty Brickell Residences, a planned two-tower Miami condominium with 803 units to be developed by PMG.",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s housing market is defying the national slowdown, with prices rising faster than in most of the country, even as sales volume plunged to the lowest August levels since 2011.\nThe median home price in the city hit $378,000 in August, up 5.9 percent year-over-year, according to Illinois Realtors. Across the nine-county metro, the median reached $375,000, up 5.6 percent. The national median was $422,600, a 2 percent bump, according to\nNational Association of Realtors\ndata first\nreported\nby Crain\u2019s.\nThe Case-Shiller Index confirmed the trend, showing July values in the region up 6.23 percent from a year earlier, compared with just 1.68 percent nationwide.\nThat makes\nChicago\nan outlier. Price growth here has stayed above 6 percent every month this year, and increased from June (6.09 percent) to July (6.23 percent) while nationally the rate has fallen by more than half since January. Half of the 30 major metros covered by the index had lower price growth in July than in June. The Illinois Realtors data comprises Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Grundy, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will counties.\nThe surge means equity gains and rising\nhousing wealth\nfor sellers and homeowners.\n\nBut for buyers, the math is tough. August sales in the city totaled just 1,920 homes, down nearly 10 percent from a year earlier and the weakest August since the post-crash recovery of 2011. Metro-wide sales dropped 4.3 percent to 8,395, also the lowest since 2011. By contrast, sales ticked up nationally 1.8 percent year-over-year, according to NAR.\nMeanwhile, contract cancellations are on the rise. Sixteen percent of pending agreements in Chicago were\ncanceled\n, a slight increase from last year and consistent with national trends showing the highest July cancellation rates since 2017.\nThe squeeze comes from a familiar combo: elevated mortgage rates and thin inventory. Homeowners who might otherwise trade up are staying put, wary of locking in higher borrowing costs and higher prices. That keeps listings scarce, pushing buyers to pay more for the limited homes available.\nChicago\u2019s unusual position \u2014 leading the nation in price gains while trailing badly in sales volume \u2014 is like a split personality in the market. Sellers are in a strong spot on paper, but deals are drying up. Chicago-area home sales in August were down year-over-year 0.8 percent.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "As Sonoma developer\nKen Mattson\nawaits trial for\nallegedly defrauding hundreds of local homeowners\n, one of his firm\u2019s lending partners has come under scrutiny of its own.\nVictims of Mattson have pointed out Socotra Capital\u2019s purported role in Mattson\u2019s wide-reaching alleged Ponzi scheme, The Press Democrat\nreported\n.\nThe Sacramento-based lender bankrolled much of Mattson\u2019s shopping spree, wherein KS Mattson Partners acquired 88 properties in and around the city of Sonoma. From 2007 to 2024, Mattson allegedly\nsold investors fake interests\nin real estate investment limited partnerships, using victims\u2019 money to fund personal expenses and pay other investors,\naccording\nto the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nSocotra Capital provided Mattson\u2019s firms with more than 100 loans totaling upwards of $180 million, according to the Press Democrat. The loans covered notable local sites including Ravenswood Winery, boutique lodging properties like Cottage Inn &amp; Span and An Inn to Remember, and even chocolate factory Cocoa Planet. Many of those properties are now on the auction block in bankruptcies related to Mattson\u2019s dealings.\nSocotra holds liens on 75 properties tied to Mattson\u2019s network, court documents reviewed by the news outlet show. The debt totals more than $100 million. And while the hard-money lender has not been accused of wrongdoing, investors who lost money through Mattson\u2019s alleged fraud want to put a magnifying glass on the firm.\n\u201cFrom Socotra\u2019s website, they proclaim, \u2018We\u2019re not like your conventional lenders with strict parameters, slow turnarounds, and unnecessary hoops to jump through,\u2019\u201d Matt Treger, who invested with Mattson over more than 15 years, told the Press Democrat. \u201cAs someone whose life savings has been swallowed up, their business model seems clear evidence that parameters and hoops are an essential part of a just system.\u201d\n\nFederal prosecutors noted Socotra\u2019s role in the scandal by referring to it in the\nMay 13 indictment\nas \u201cLending Entity 1.\u201d For its part, Socotra denies knowledge of any of Mattson\u2019s actions.\n\u201cWith regards to KS Mattson [Partners], we had no knowledge or involvement in Mattson\u2019s alleged wrongdoing. Socotra acted appropriately and in accordance with the law at all times,\u201d a company spokesperson told the outlet. \u201cAs a secured, first-position lender, all our loans are secured by high-quality real estate, including those related to KS Mattson loans.\u201d\nMattson stands accused of wire fraud, money laundering and obstruction of justice in a nine-count indictment. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for each count of wire fraud and the obstruction of justice count and 10 years in prison for the money laundering count.\nSo far, Socotra hasn\u2019t faced legal complaints of its own from Mattson\u2019s investors or regulators.\n\u201cIn the aftermath of their lending spree, to continue putting profits over the victims in a scheme they enabled and benefitted from would feel morally reprehensible,\u201d Treger said. \u201cMy hope is that, as an investor group, we pursue every avenue to determine accountability and recompense\u2026 They may be trying to protect their profits, while we as victims are fighting for our lives and what was taken from us.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Since then, the cloud data company has transformed its headquarters into a hub for artificial intelligence moguls across the region.\nThe firm opened its \u201cSilicon Valley AI Hub\u201d last week. It\u2019s a 30,000-square-foot space on the top floor of its\nMenlo Park\nheadquarters, the San Francisco Standard\nreported\n.\nThe space is designed for companies and developers interested in AI to exchange knowledge and develop their products. In a recent event there, executives at OpenAI, Windsurf and\nGlean\ngave their ideas on how to scale AI startups, per the Standard.\nTo inaugurate the space, 13 startups will set up operations at the hub over the course of three months. They\u2019ll have access to coworking space, professional video studios and snacks for employees, as well as Snowflake\u2019s computing infrastructure and proximity to the firm\u2019s investor network.\nThat\u2019s not all; next year Snowflake will expand the space with a rooftop restaurant and bar, transforming it from a simple workspace to a destination for workers on and off the clock.\n\nThe public release of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT in 2022 prompted Snowflake to lean hard into AI. Between 2020 \u2014 when it had its IPO \u2014 and 2025, the company\u2019s headcount ballooned from 1,000 to 8,000. As the\nfirm grew\n, it needed space to accommodate all of its employees.\nLast year, it settled on\nsubleasing a 773,000-square-foot, three-building campus\nin Menlo Park that Meta had pre-leased and built out but never occupied. That deal is still the Bay Area\u2019s largest post-pandemic office lease.\nWith summer melting away, Snowflake is preparing for a blizzard of new releases. In November, the company is set to unveil a host of AI products. While it\u2019s partnered in the past with OpenAI and Anthropic to integrate language models into its products, Snowflake wants to cross-pollinate with as many AI voices as possible, and its AI hub is meant to be the meeting place.\nThe company plans to host up to 10 events a week at the AI hub, Snowflake chief marketing officer Denise Persson said. Those could include networking dinners, hackathons and educational sessions. The hope is that Snowflake will be able to discover and work with some of the brightest new minds in the\nbooming sector\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

She\u2019s converting the 37,000-square-foot warehouse, at 2501 Commerce Street, into an exhibition hall and event space, while the former lumber offices, at 25 Live Oak Alley, will become a 96-key boutique hotel with a rooftop bar.\nThe exhibition hall is slated to open in November with a splashy debut: the Balloon Museum, a global traveling art installation featuring large-scale inflatable sculptures. The $450,000 warehouse conversion is being designed by Conejo Architecture, and Molina told the outlet she\u2019s working \u201cseven days a week\u201d to meet the deadline, with weddings, quincea\u00f1eras and private events expected to follow.\nThe hotel, scheduled to open in time for the\n2026 World Cup\n, will add two floors to the historic 1938 concrete structure, bringing the building to four stories and 78,700 square feet. Designed by MCS Architects, the $4 million project won\u2019t carry a major hotel flag at launch.\n\nMolina, who founded Bonita Grand Holdings, bought the properties in 2019 and began planning last year.

The 51-key hotel, at 347 West 20th Street, is expected to open in early 2026. The developer is Austin-based Bunkhouse Hotels, the firm behind Hotel Saint Augustine in Montrose.\nThe timing also coincides with broader\ndevelopment momentum\naround Houston\u2019s East End, including the\noverhaul of the George R.

Now, rents on new leases are slipping in places such as Dallas, Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville, among the most oversupplied housing markets in the country.\nMeanwhile, single-family landlord giants like Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent, who previously bet that stretched affordability would keep young families renting, are also feeling the heat.\nNationally, more than 3 million homes were put up for sale at the start of summer, but only 28 percent found buyers, leaving nearly 2 million unsold, according to housing analytics firm Parcl Labs. That\u2019s a fifth higher than the same time last year.\nWith sellers either slashing prices, delisting or defaulting to renting, the spillover is hitting single-family rental operators.\n\nInvitation, which owns about 80,000 homes, reported rent declines for new tenants in several Florida and Texas cities. To offset the slide, it and rival AMH are raising rents for existing tenants; Invitation raised rates for existing tenants by 6.2 percent in South Florida this year, even as new renters got a slight discount.\nThat tactic props up revenue for now, but it risks widening the gap between in-place and market rents, potentially spurring turnover.\nInvestors who piled into the single-family rental trade during the pandemic are also feeling the squeeze. Shares of big landlords have lagged behind the S&amp;P 500, homebuilders and apartment real estate investment trusts.\nIronically, a break in mortgage rates could ease the glut of unsold homes now leaking into rentals, but it would also lure more renters into homeownership, raising vacancy risk.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A group of conservative City Council members is making a last-ditch effort to stop ballot measures that could overhaul how certain housing projects are approved in the city.\nMembers of the Council\u2019s Common Sense Caucus filed a lawsuit asking a state Supreme Court to void three\nquestions\nthat will be posed to voters in November.\nThe questions, if approved, would weaken the City Council\u2019s sway over certain housing and infrastructure projects, in an effort to speed up construction and sidestep members who are notoriously against new housing in their districts.\nThe lawsuit claims three of the five ballot measures violate city and state environmental laws by \u201cfailing to incorporate environmental concerns and considerations into the ballot proposals.\u201d\n\u201cPetitioners are not opposed to increased housing \u2013 particularly affordable housing \u2013 or in solving the housing crisis,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cPetitioners are opposed, however, to covering up and concealing the environmental consequences of the ballot proposals.\u201d\nThe lawsuit \u2014 filed against Mayor Eric Adams, his Charter Revision Commission and the Board of Elections \u2014 alleges that the questions should be annulled until the environmental consequences of the measures are assessed. Plaintiffs include Council members Joann Ariola, David Carr and Robert Holden, along with other Republican lawmakers, including Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, community groups and Council member Darlene Mealy, a Brooklyn Democrat.\nThe Board of Elections certified and printed the ballots this month, meaning that it is too late for the questions to be removed.\nCouncil members have not been shy about their opposition to the ballot measures, which threaten a fundamental power members have held since the 1980s.\nThe City Council effectively has the final say over land use actions through the city\u2019s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, or Ulurp. Members tend to vote according to the wishes of the local member, in a tradition called member deference (though the Council\ndefied\nthe practice last week with two small housing projects).\nOne of the ballot questions targeted by the lawsuit asks whether the city should replace the rarely-used mayoral veto in Ulurp with a three-member appeals board for certain housing projects. The board would be able to reverse Council decisions on projects that would result in affordable housing in one borough.\nAnother question asks voters if modest housing and infrastructure projects should go through a quicker review process, dubbed Expedited Land Use Review Procedure, or Elurp, that skips City Council or City Planning approval, depending on the project type.\n\nThe third proposal would fast-track housing (avoiding a Council vote) in the 12 districts that have approved the lowest rates of affordable housing over a five-year period.\nThe other two\nquestions\non the ballot, which have gone unchallenged, ask if local elections should be moved to even years, coinciding with presidential elections, and if the official street map of the city should be digitized and consolidated.\nThe questions are the same three that City Council leaders have called misleading. Speaker Adrienne Adams has said the proposals threaten to consolidate power in City Hall, while stripping Council members of leverage to secure deeper housing affordability and other benefits when negotiating with developers.\nThe Council tried to\nconvince\nthe city Board of Elections to remove the questions before ballots were printed.\nThat effort\nfailed\n, and Speaker Adams said she wouldn\u2019t file a lawsuit, opting for a public campaign against the measures instead.\nA spokesperson for Council leadership indicated on Tuesday that the Speaker and broader Council are not involved with the Common Sense Caucus\u2019 lawsuit. A representative for the Common Sense Caucus said that attorneys working on the case have filed the lawsuit pro bono.\nThe complaint shares plaintiffs and some arguments with\nanother lawsuit\nfiled in March, which alleged that the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity should be annulled. The complaint, also led by members of the Common Sense Caucus, claimed that the Adams administration violated city and state environmental laws by failing to do a comprehensive review of the impact of the zoning changes.\nThe Black Institute, Queens Civic Congress, Midtown South Community Council and Park West Village Tenants\u2019 Association are listed as plaintiffs in both cases. Attorney Jack Lester is also working on the two lawsuits.\nThe City Council recently launched a\nwebsite\nurging New Yorkers to vote against the three questions. Proponents of the questions, including pro-housing group Open New York, announced this month that they would spend $3 million to promote the ballot measures.\n\u201cThe GOP doesn\u2019t want affordable housing on the ballot because they know the truth: these measures are widely popular, will pass overwhelmingly, and help keep New York the most diverse and dynamic city in the world,\u201d Amit Singh, director of the YES on Affordable Housing campaign, said in a statement. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it here, I\u2019ve got a house to sell you in Nassau County.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Moshe Silber filed for personal bankruptcy as creditors circle the imprisoned real estate investor.\nSilber\n, who amassed a 10,000-unit multifamily portfolio by his early 30s, made the filing this month in New York\u2019s Southern District. He claimed he owned no property, had no income and no assets.\nSilber\u2019s bankruptcy filing shows a drastically different picture than his financial statements showed just three years ago. Silber once flaunted items and investments worth millions, including luxury cars, jewelry and a private jet, alongside multiple homes in upstate New York. He also owned part of a bank in Westchester County.\nThe managers in charge of one of Silber\u2019s former holdings companies, CBRM Realty, are seeking to move the case from New York to New Jersey, where CBRM\u2019s bankruptcy is ongoing.\nCBRM\u2019s attorneys claim Silber filed for personal bankruptcy on the eve of CBRM\u2019s plan to commence legal action against him. They claim that Silber mismanaged properties and \u201cextracted tens of millions (if not hundreds of millions of dollars) of value from those properties for his own benefit.\u201d\nSilber\u2019s personal bankruptcy blocks litigation in New York State Supreme Court, including at least three lawsuits from creditors seeking to pursue Silber for tens of millions of dollars over unpaid debts.\nSilber, of Suffern, New York, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud last year and was sentenced in March to 30 months in prison. It was part of a broader investigation into commercial mortgage fraud by the Department of Justice and the Federal Housing and Finance Agency.\nSilber and his co-conspirators allegedly provided a fraudulent purchase price of $95.8 million for their 976-unit apartment complex in\nCincinnati\nto obtain a $70 million mortgage from JLL and Fannie Mae. The judge presiding over the case noted Silber\u2019s fraud was significant because of the \u201clayers and labyrinth of chicanery.\u201d\nOnce Silber pleaded guilty, he was effectively banned from managing CBRM and its 6,300-unit\u00a0 multifamily portfolio. He appointed an independent fiduciary, which was approved by CBRM\u2019s noteholders. (Silber had obtained $200 million in financing from bondholders.)\n\nBut Silber and his co-conspirator Fred Schulman allegedly refused to give up the equity interests in the CBRM portfolio. This made it difficult to find financing for the bankruptcy or for the properties, according to a filing by CBRM\u2019s lawyers.\nSilber\u2019s properties were mostly vacant and had negative cash flow. Some units were uninhabitable. He was being pursued separately by the Alleghany County, Pennsylvania, District Attorney for taking money from his company\u2019s apartment properties outside of Pittsburgh.\nUnder the direction of an independent fiduciary, CBRM filed for bankruptcy in May to stop a creditor\u2019s attempt to\nsell\nthe company, which controlled 6,300 multifamily units, at a sheriff sale.\nCBRM is now trying to sell its properties through bankruptcy, including 1,512 units, in New Orleans. A portion of the proceeds will go toward funding litigation against Silber and Schulman.\nCBRM said Silber has made life difficult for the restructuring managers. The firm\u2019s lawyers tried to depose Silber this month in jail, but Silber asserted the Fifth Amendment to all substantive questions, according to a court filing.\nSilber\u2019s attorney declined to comment. CBRM\u2019s attorney did not respond to a request to comment.\nSilber\u2019s attorney initially filed the bankruptcy as a Chapter 7, a liquidation of assets, but later claimed it was an error and he meant to file Chapter 11, a restructuring.\nThe bankruptcy petition also makes a number of other surprising claims, including that Silber has not lived anywhere else in the past three years. (Silber\u2019s prison sentence started in early 2025.) It also claims he is not married, but at the time of Silber\u2019s sentencing earlier this year, he claimed he was married.\nThe filing states Moshe Silber borrowed money from his father Zalman Silber to cover his bankruptcy legal fees.\n",

The company is expected to build a\nsurf park\nwith state-of-the-art artificial wave technology for those looking to hang 10.\nToba Capital acquired the parcel from California landlord Continental Corporation. Continental bought the 30-acre office campus from Raytheon in 2021 with plans to redevelop it into a 600,000-square-foot mixed-use complex called Impact at Nash, with office, retail and media production portions.\nContinental and Mar Ventures redeveloped a 14-acre portion of the site into the\nChargers\u2019 $260 million training center and headquarters\n, which opened last year. As demand for offices and residences lost steam, Continental decided to sell off the property.\nThough he made his fortune selling his tech company to Dell Computer, Smith is no stranger to creating surf parks. Smith is an avid surfer and spent $80 million to convert the former Knotts Soak City water park in\nPalm Springs\ninto the Palm Springs Surf Club, which opened last year. The 21-acre complex has a wave pool large enough for 25 surfers at once and features a lazy river and restaurants.\n\nThe goal is to do the same in Los Angeles and possibly in other cities across the United States.\nAbout 20 surf parks worldwide are in operation, with\nfour in the U.S.\nand several others debuting in the next two years. Kelly Slater Wave Company, founded by the world record-holding surfer Kelly Slater,\noperates a complex at Surf Ranch\nin Kings County, California, and provides its wave technology to Surf Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.\nIn San Diego County, developer N4FL is planning to start construction next year on Ocean Kamp, a sprawling resort complex with a 3.5-acre wave pool, 700 housing units, a 300-room hotel and commercial spaces on a 92-acre former drive-in theater site in Oceanside, the outlet said.\nMeanwhile, In Newport Beach, a proposal for a 7-acre wave pool is moving forward, though residents have voiced opposition to the plan, which would partially involve the replacement of a portion of the public Newport Beach Golf Course.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

An Ikea store will occupy the first and second floors, totaling about 25,000 square feet.\nThe building is a 58,000-square-foot, six-story commercial building at the corner of Broadway and Spring Street, according to BKSK, the building\u2019s architect.

He did not immediately return a request for comment.\nThe property is significantly smaller than Ikea\u2019s already-operating stores. Its Red Hook location, built in 2007, is more than 336,000 square feet. That location is zoned for big-box retail, while the Broadway location is zoned for more traditional retail, according to city property records.\n\nBut it also wouldn\u2019t be Ikea\u2019s first attempt to fit into a tight space.\nIn 2019, the company opened a \u201cPlanning Studio\u201d at 999 Third Avenue, in a 17,000-square-foot space,\nCurbed\nreported.

        "content": "I like to say that there are no coincidences in politics.\nCase in point: The last four City Council approvals of a real estate project over the objections of the local member were at the end of four-year election cycles: 2009, 2021 and 2025. Credit for that observation goes to Howard Slatkin of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council.\nThe Council\u2019s message when it ignores the custom of \u201cmember deference\u201d seems to be: \u201cSee? We\u2019re not provincial, turf-protecting insiders! We act in the interest of the whole city!\u201d\nBut we\u2019re talking about four instances in two decades, if not longer. The Council has considered thousands of land use applications in that time, and in 99.9 percent of them, the local member has decided the result.\nMake no mistake: Member deference is alive and well.\nIt\u2019s also not a coincidence that two of the four instances came last week, as the Council was preparing a campaign against City Charter revisions that \u2014 if approved by voters on Nov. 4 \u2014 would weaken member deference.\nPerhaps Council Speaker Adrienne Adams will point to the chamber\u2019s Sept. 25\napproval\nof Bronx and Brooklyn rezonings over the objections of Council members Kristy Marmorato and Simcha Felder, respectively, as evidence that the system works. No reform needed!\nSorry, no. As noted, these are election-year exceptions. True outliers.\nThe 2021 override was to approve a\nNew York Blood Center project\n. In that case, the Council snubbed a member unpopular with his colleagues, Ben Kallos. He had sided with\nentitled Upper East Side residents\nwho claimed shadows would ruin their precious playground. Project supporters said it was more important to find a cure for sickle cell anemia.\nTo be sure, there was some political theater going on. Kallos claimed he might have negotiated a deal with developer Longfellow Real Estate Partners had Council leaders not hijacked the process.\nIncidentally, the Blood Center project has\nyet to break ground\n.\nGetting back to charter revision: One measure would create an appeals process for applicants voted down by the Council. Rejections could be overturned by getting two votes from a three-member panel of the mayor, borough president and Council speaker.\nWill any voters change their minds about the charter questions as a result of the Council\u2019s votes last Thursday? No chance. Only land-use geeks will even connect those dots. But the Charter Revision Commission can take some credit for the overrides.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhile the Council speaker asks New Yorkers to vote against charter reforms that weaken the Council\u2019s power, Council conservatives and Rep. Nicole Malliotakis\nsued on Tuesday\nto remove those three questions from the ballot.\n\nThey complain that the revisions would fast-track some projects around environmental reviews. That is exactly the point: to stop needless reviews that gum up the process and make housing more expensive.\nOnce upon a time, conservatives sought to free the private sector from bureaucracy and frivolous litigation. Here, they are suing to do the opposite.\nIt\u2019s an ironic but common example of conservatives exploiting processes created by liberals to delay new housing and infrastructure. What are your thoughts? Email them to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: A Quinnipiac\npoll\nof likely New Jersey voters found only 6 percent of them (including 8 percent of Democrats and 4 percent of Republicans) considered affordable housing the most important issue in determining their vote in the governor\u2019s race. Why so few? In part because 63 percent of New Jerseyans are homeowners.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 Remember when residential mortgages\nwere bundled into securities and sold to investors in public markets? That hasn\u2019t happened since 2013 \u2014 not because publicly issued RMBS were banned, but because\nregulations\nput in place five years after the housing crash effectively killed them. The regs required detailed information on every mortgage in these bundled securities.\nLast week, the Securities and Exchange Commission\nasked for comments\nabout reviving them. If that sounds familiar, you are one of the few people who continued paying attention to this issue after \u201c\nThe Big Short\n.\u201d For everyone else: In 2019, then-SEC Chairman Jay Clayton issued an\nidentical request\n. But Donald Trump lost the election, Clayton left his post, and the RMBS effort was mothballed. (Clayton is now the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan.)\n\u2014 President Trump\u2019s new tariffs\non lumber and cabinets will add $720 and $280, respectively, to the cost of a new home,\nUBS estimates\n. The first tariff adds 10 percent to the cost of softwood timber and lumber imports, and the second adds 25 percent to the cost of kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and upholstered wood products.\n\u2014 Want an ADU?\nThe city on Tuesday began accepting applications to create accessory dwelling units through the\nDOB NOW: Build filing portal\n.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$5.75 million\nfor a 2,170-square-foot condominium unit at 151 East 58th Street, One Beacon Court in Sutton Place. Marina Bernshtein with Brown Harris Stevens had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial transaction recorded was $213 million for a 44,200-square-foot retail property at\n529 Broadway in Soho\n. The seller was a joint venture that included Jeff Sutton\u2019s Wharton Properties. The buyer was the furniture store Ikea.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$11.75 million\nfor a pre-war co-op at 770 Park Avenue in Lenox Hill. Leslie R. Coleman and Christina Lee with Brown Harris Stevens have the listing.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "Valerie Russo works two jobs, from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m., at a Hudson Valley shopping center. She and her three kids have lived in a motel room for two years, courtesy of Ulster County.\nThe Albany Times Union ran an\nexcellent story\nabout homeless Hudson Valley families stuck in hotels for years, with Russo as its centerpiece.\nHer experience is not unusual. Ulster County has contracts with 24 hotels and two shelters, but families spend an average of\nmore than three years\nin this \u201cemergency\u201d housing.\nFrom a real estate perspective, these contracts are a reliable source of income for hotel owners. But from a social-welfare and public-spending perspective, this is a disaster.\nHotels are built for short visits, not for boys and girls to spend their childhood. The cost to taxpayers for Russo\u2019s room is $110 a night.\nIt would be cheaper to house families in apartments, but the article doesn\u2019t explain why that does not happen. Probably it\u2019s because motels can keep rooms available for immediate placements, while apartment buildings cannot.\nHowever, if the average stay is 1,132 days, it makes no sense to use properties designed for temporary housing. It\u2019s not disclosed why these families are not using rental vouchers, but we know that many more people are eligible for vouchers than actually receive them.\nThe article eventually gets to the question of why the rent in Kingston is too high for working families like Russo\u2019s.\nThis might sound familiar: Two Kingston council members say the area median income used to determine rents for affordable housing is too high because it includes richer areas outside Kingston.\n\nThey propose lowering the AMI by only including Kingston in the metric. That, in turn, would reduce rents that are based on a percentage of AMI.\nSome advocates make\nthe same claim\nabout New York City, where the AMI is elevated by wealthier suburbs.\nThe obvious problem is that in the Real World, legislating lower rents does not reduce the cost of building and operating housing. The lower the rent, the fewer projects pencil out.\nKingston\u2019s mayor and housing director predicted that if the affordability threshold were lowered for multifamily\ndevelopment in Kingston\n, it simply wouldn\u2019t be built.\nIt\u2019s clear that building housing with rents that some families cannot afford is better than not building at all. Without a doubt, the affordable units will become homes for some people who need them.\nHomelessness is largely a housing problem, and it persists in Kingston because housing growth did not keep pace with demand, pushing vacancy rates down and prices up.\nThe city does now have some multifamily developments in the pipeline. But Valerie Russo still might not be able to afford their affordable units \u2014 or any apartments freed up by people moving into the new projects.\nReal estate alone cannot solve her problem, which is as much about her income being too low for a family of four as it is about Kingston rents being too high.\nThe solution in Kingston, as it is in New York City, is a rental voucher and a sufficient supply of housing to ensure she can use it.\n",

An LLC paid another LLC just under $18 million for the condo at Extell Development Company\u2019s\n50 Riverside Boulevard\n, which previously traded for $19.7 million almost a decade ago. The six-bedroom, full-floor pad spans nearly 6,200 square feet, pricing the latest deal at about $2,900 per square foot, and has a private elevator landing, 60-foot great room, 100 feet of Hudson River frontage. Actress Kerry Washington once rented the unit for $70,000 a month. The condo first went up for sale in 2021 with an asking price of $27.5 million.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe top commercial transaction recorded in the city went to a joint venture that includes\nJeff Sutton\u2019s Wharton Properties\n, which offloaded a 44,200-square-foot retail property at\n529 Broadway in Soho\nfor $213 million. The buyer was the furniture store Ikea, which had a pop-up in the neighborhood last year at 51 Crosby Street. In what was a record for Soho at the time, the venture purchased the property in 2012 for $147.9 million.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nA trust tied to\nRina Pan\nparted with a condo at\n151 East 58th Street\n, also known as One Beacon Court, in Sutton Place for $5.8 million. Pan purchased the two-bedroom, 2,200-square-foot unit in 2005 for $3.2 million. The buyer was\nEZ Equity NY LLC\n. The unit has been on and off the market since 2010; it went into contract at an asking price of $6.3 million.\nMarina Bernshtein\nwith Brown Harris Stevens had the listing.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nA development site at\n92-94 North 9th Avenue\nin Williamsburg with about 8,000 buildable square feet traded for $3.8 million. The seller of the vacant lot was Floral Park, New York-based investor and developer\nMetropolitan Homes\n. The buyers were\nAvi Dishi\n, founder of Elysee Investment Company, and his wife,\nRachel Dishi\n. Metropolitan Homes paid $1.3 million for the site in 2013.\nBy the Numbers:\nPending home sales jump across U.S. as mortgage rates fall in August\n\nPending home sales rose in August as mortgage rates declined.\nThe National Association of Realtors\u2019\nPending Home Sales Index\n, which measures home sales based on deals in contract, rose 4 percent in August from July and 3.8 percent higher year over year.\nThe rising index, adjusted for seasonality, indicates an improvement in the housing market, as transactions typically take one to two months to finalize. NAR, an industry organization that represents both the commercial and residential sectors, attributed the increase to last month\u2019s\ndrop in borrowing costs\nahead of the\nFederal Reserve\u2019s September meeting\n.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

It was the only California property among the 10 priciest homes last month, which included four sales in Florida between $28 million and $36 million, and a Greenwich, Connecticut, home that sold for $43.5 million.\nThe Benedict Canyon home sold for $2,793 per square foot. It hit the market in 2023 for $72.5 million. It was listed in January for $56.9 million. The buyer was an entity known as Murray Hill Real Estate. Caruso bought the home via RFG-Lavender LLC in 2018 for $16.7 million, or $982 per square foot.\nThe property spans more than 17,000 square feet and features a 130-foot-long driveway, six-car garage, elevator, library and theater. The primary suite is 2,000 square feet and has its own living room and 900-square-foot balcony.

Galvin declined to disclose terms of the pending sale or why Newcastle exited.\nThe refreshed plan leans heavily on smaller units, with a majority set to be studios aimed at offering more attainable rents in one of the city\u2019s hottest neighborhoods. Roughly 20 percent, or 54 units, will be affordable under the city\u2019s ordinance. The project also calls for 3,800 square feet of ground-floor retail and 30 parking spaces \u2014 fewer than Newcastle\u2019s approved version, reflecting the unit mix and the site\u2019s proximity to the Morgan CTA L station.\nGalvin called the site \u201ca tremendous development\u201d opportunity in the heart of Fulton Market. The project is slated for completion in 2027, though financing details are under wraps. He said the venture has seen \u201cstrong interest\u201d from equity and debt partners but isn\u2019t ready to name backers.\n\nApartment construction downtown has slowed sharply amid high interest rates, rising construction costs and broader economic jitters, although several\noffice-to-residential\nconversions are underway. With only a few hundred\nunits\nexpected this year and next, rents have surged, climbing 6.4 percent year-over-year in the second quarter, according to Integra Realty Resources. Developers willing to brave the financing headwinds may find an undersupplied market waiting.\nThe project marks the first ground-up downtown development for\nSloniger\nand his new firm after leaving Marquette, where he pushed the West Loop frontier with projects like Parq Fulton and Evo Union Park.\nGalvin\n, meanwhile, has expanded his brokerage firm into development, partnering last year on the Saint Grand tower in Streeterville.\nThe pivot at 210 North Morgan follows other resets in the area.

        "content": "Developer Dan Kodsi missed a deadline to post a surety bond as part of an agreement reached with his lender, Monarch Alternative Capital, in the Legacy Miami Worldcenter foreclosure.\nKodsi\u2019s Legacy MWC Trustee and Legacy MWC Land Trust have been wrapped up in\nlitigation\nwith New York-based Monarch since the summer over the construction loan backing the Legacy Hotel &amp; Residences project site at Miami Worldcenter. Construction of the 50-story tower has\nbeen on hold\nsince last year.\nIn an order Judge Spencer Eig\nentered in August,\nEig said the developer had until Sept. 22 to post a $32 million surety bond, and until early November to pay Monarch more than $35 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest and late fees. The order was the result of an agreement reached between the borrower and lender. The payment would satisfy the mortgage and eventually resolve the foreclosure suit.\nThe developer\u2019s LLCs \u201cfailed to timely post\u201d the bond, according to Monarch\u2019s notice, filed last Wednesday. Because no surety bond was posted, the developer\u2019s rights to enforce the terms of their agreement \u201cimmediately lapse\u201d and \u201care terminated without further order of the court,\u201d Monarch\u2019s attorney, Josh Rubens, wrote in his notice.\nA source told\nThe Real Deal\nthat the developer has the funds to post the bond, but instead is using those funds to try and settle with Monarch.\n\nRubens declined to comment. Kodsi and his attorney, Joseph Pardo, also declined to comment. The judge\u2019s August order bans the developer, lender, their employees, agents, representatives or attorneys from making any public statements about the case.\nEig\u2019s August order was necessary for the developer to refinance the loan. In a July 31 hearing, Kodsi, CEO of Royal Palm Companies, said he\u2019s working on a $390 million refinancing of the\n$340 million\nloan.\nSilverstein Capital Partners provided the developer with the original construction loan in late 2021, but Silverstein only funded $30 million, Kodsi said during the July 31 hearing. Monarch Alternative Capital took over the loan on June 6 of this year.\nLegacy, a partially built mixed-use condo and hotel tower at 942 Northeast First Avenue in downtown Miami, is expected to have 310 short-term rental-friendly condos, a 219-key hotel and a medical and wellness center. Kodsi launched condo sales in 2019, and the condo portion sold out during the pandemic for an estimated $160 million. Construction began in 2021, and it was expected to be completed last year.\nKodsi\n\u2019s Royal Palm has worked with Monarch before. The developer, in its counterclaim, alleged that Monarch was forced to back down from Monarch\u2019s alleged effort to wipe out Royal Palm\u2019s equity in a Coco Beach project. That\u2019s when Monarch allegedly shifted its attention to the Miami Worldcenter project, Royal Palm alleged.\n",

        "content": "Marx Realty\u2019s 35-story building at 10 Grand Central is nearly full. Craig Deitelzweig, Marx\u2019s CEO, did a multi-million-dollar renovation, adding hotel-like amenities to the drab office that used to go by 708 Third Avenue. Tenant demand is now so furious Deitelzweig raised rents four times in the past year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the strongest office markets that we\u2019ve seen in a decade,\u201d he said.\nNot all New York City office dealmakers will make a claim like that, but most will acknowledge the comeback in a sector that descended into the edges of hell during Covid only to remain in purgatory for years.\nEarlier this year, New York City recorded the lowest office vacancy rate of any major city, according to Moody\u2019s. Foot traffic has exceeded pre-pandemic numbers, Placer.ai data shows. And new leasing in Midtown rose to 5.3 million square feet in the second quarter, its highest mark since 2019, according to a report from Cushman &amp; Wakefield.\nNews from the leasing market has spurred big-ticket deals. RXR\u2019s recent purchase of 590 Madison Avenue, a 1 million-square-foot tower formerly home to IBM, was the first sale of over $1 billion since 2022.\n\u201c590 Madison was finally the culmination of all the trends that we were seeing and the conversations we\u2019ve been having that the market was finally ready to get a billion-dollar-plus single asset sale done,\u201d said Gary Phillips, managing director of Eastdil Secured, who brokered the deal.\nAnother sign of a comeback: Blackstone is looking at the sector. When Jon Gray and the trillion-dollar Blackstone operation put their money into something, others follow. In June, the firm made one of its first moves into office since Covid, acquiring a large stake in Fisher Brothers\u2019 1345 Sixth Avenue. It also bid on 590 Madison and on Paramount Group, the New York City and San Francisco office landlord with 13 million square feet of Class A office space that reached a deal to sell to Rithm Capital in September.\nMeanwhile, Related Companies might build a new office at 625 Madison Avenue, where it had planned a 1,220-foot, 68-story supertall with residential, hotel and retail. The pivot would be to an \u201cAA-class office tower.\u201d\nPadding the environment, the Federal Reserve finally lowered the federal funds rate in September, while suggesting future rate cuts. CBRE already expects an uptick in deals.\nBut the scope of the office comeback is unclear. Institutional investors are still not making broad bets on office, but are surgically picking spots in sub-markets within a sub-market. At the same time, an untold amount of distress is playing out behind the scenes with lenders.\n\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s early days of a recovery in office,\u201d said Spencer Garfield, co-head of CRE credit at Fortress Investment Group. \u201cBut that recovery is underway, and there\u2019s still pain to be had, because there are still over-levered properties, and there are still poorly run properties and undercapitalized sponsors.\u201d\nR\neturn journey\nNew York City\u2019s office comeback story started with leasing.\nWith new construction virtually stopped and the trophy towers of One Vanderbilt, Hudson Yards and Manhattan West filled up, companies searching for space looked elsewhere.\nThey first turned to Park Avenue because of its close proximity to Grand Central, which seemed more convenient than ever for employees returning to the office, especially from the Northern suburbs. With its historic reputation as the premier office address, vacancy rates for Park Avenue declined to less than 10 percent in 2024, far below the city\u2019s average, according to CoStar.\nPark Avenue building owners opted to spend tens of millions on amenities and upgrades.\n\u201cThere happen to be 30 to 40 tenants right now in the market looking for big block space in and around Grand Central and Midtown East.\u201d G\naby Rosen, RFR\nAby Rosen\u2019s RFR Holdings put about $30 million into the Seagram Building, considered the Rolls-Royce of buildings when it was built in the late \u201950s. It\u2019s now fully occupied, averaging leases in the mid-$200s per square foot. Some tenants at Seagram are making forward commitments for 2027 and 2028, son Gaby Rosen noted, because of concerns about finding space in the area.\n\u201cEven though the overall market availability rate is still relatively very high, there is a lack of supply of big block space,\u201d Gaby Rosen of RFR said. \u201cAnd there happen to be 30 to 40 tenants right now in the market looking for big block space in and around Grand Central and Midtown East.\u201d\nSuch tenants scour Midtown for buildings with their desired amenities, including modern lobbies, high ceilings and spacious conference rooms. Options have been limited. Amazon, which needed to find a place for its 350,000 corporate employees returning to the office, inked a 330,000-square-foot lease at Property &amp; Building Corp\u2019s 10 Bryant Park, a 1980s offIce tower with extensive upgrades. It also enlisted WeWork to lease even more space on its behalf.\nYet institutional investors remained on the sidelines. No one wanted to be the first mover, and other business lines, such as private credit, offered returns of over 15 percent, too lucrative for investment giants to pass up.\n\nSo while the leasing upswing brought hope, the lack of sales still led to stagnation. Without comps, investors could not ascertain valuations. The smart money worried about catching a falling knife. What if values dropped further and they were stuck holding an asset with a big mortgage and no buyers?\nN\new life\nBut deals started to trickle in around 2024. Kevin Chisholm\u2019s 60 Guilders and Sentry Realty bought 292 Madison Avenue, a 26-story Midtown office building, from Vanbarton for $90 million, or $450 per square foot, in late 2024. A few months later, Chisholm and Sentry partnered again to buy 1370 Broadway for $75.5 million.\nBoth purchases had hefty discounts, compared to previous sale prices. Neither building would be considered a trophy asset, but at least, the bottom of the market started to emerge.\nIn the summer of 2025, investors felt confident about the fundamentals of New York City. Employees were returning to the office at a faster rate than the rest of the country.\nThat\u2019s when Blackstone reappeared, picking up a 46 percent stake in 1345 Sixth Avenue, a 50-story office tower, as part of a deal that included an $850 million CMBS refinancing.\nAfter years of distancing itself from the asset class and assuring investors it did not have significant exposure to office, Blackstone\u2019s tone changed. It\u2019s okay to own at least some office again, it seemed to be confiding. There\u2019s no shame in being an office landlord.\nDeals kept coming rolling in. In August, RXR purchased 590 Madison Avenue. (Some have described the 43-story, 1 million-square-foot property as a B building in an A+ location.)\nBXP even indicated to investors it might build its 46-story, 1 million-square-foot office tower at 343 Madison Avenue on spec. (In late July, an anchor tenant emerged: BXP said it signed a letter of intent for an unnamed investment firm to lease 30 percent of the building.)\nIn September, SL Green went into contract to buy the former home of Brooks Brothers on Madison Avenue near Grand Central for $160 million, with the possibility of building a 800,000-square-foot office tower on the site.\nThat same month, Rithm Capital reached a deal to buy Paramount Group, which controls 9 million square feet of Class A New York office, for $1.6 billion, or $6.60 a share.\nRithm\u2019s CEO Michael Nierenberg noted his firm\u2019s own struggles to find New York City office space as a sign of the sector\u2019s recovery.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for this for a long time,\u201d Nierenberg said.\nN\new season\nEvery time a crash occurs, commentators say: This time, it\u2019s different. But the Covid-induced office crash really was different from the 2008 financial crisis, for one.\nThis time, work-from-home policies threatened the existence of office real estate, driving down values because of real changes in behavior. When the Fed started hiking rates in 2022, landlords had to consider cash-in refinancings for the first time.\nBanks backed out of the market, dealing with their own troubled loans, but debt funds and so-called alternative lenders filled the gap, offering new financing for existing landlords trying to fend off foreclosures.\n\u201cUnlike the 2008 Great Financial Crisis, there\u2019s still money available today,\u201d said Lonnie Hendry, chief product officer at Trepp. \u201cIt\u2019s just the terms that are very unfavorable.\u201d\nThese lenders allowed owners to hang on to properties, Hendry said. But the cost of their capital is still raising questions about whether the financing just postponed inevitable losses.\n\u201cYou can argue that it increases the risk across the system, that we just haven\u2019t seen it yet, or you can argue that that\u2019s been the saving grace,\u201d said Hendry. \u201cI think it\u2019s too soon to tell.\u201d\nMore lenders probably will take back properties, and more borrowers will likely suffer losses. At the same time, landlords are finally landing anchor tenants for their next towers, and new construction will start again.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a world of stress and distress, and then there\u2019s a world of recovery, and they\u2019re both unfolding at the same time,\u201d Fortress\u2019 Garfield said.",

        "content": "At 1422 Greene Avenue, tenants are paying the building\u2019s gas bill. Earlier this year, residents at 1335 Hancock Street went five months without hot water. The lock at 1339 Hancock is broken, and a metal bar holds the door open.\nThese Bushwick buildings have one trait in common: their landlord, Aron Stark.\nIn a rarity for negligent landlords, Stark spent eight days in Rikers Island in 2023 after failing to respond to the court about repairs ordered to 1422 Greene. But more than two years later, Stark hasn\u2019t cleaned up his act. Tenants say Stark has abandoned several of his properties, and many continue to rack up housing code violations, city fines and property tax bills.\nThe city put some Stark buildings into a program that lets regulators make repairs and then bill the owner, but even that hasn\u2019t had much effect on the situation, or the landlord\u2019s operations.\nSince the\n2019 Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act\u2019s\npassage, falling property values and rising costs have surpassed income at many buildings, making major repairs financially untenable. In cases like Stark\u2019s, it can be cheaper to abandon a building than fix it.\nThe conundrum shows off the difficulty of city enforcement in a rent-stabilized market under strain. If the city does its own repairs and sends the wayward landlord the bill, that\u2019s\njust the cost of doing business\n. (That is if a landlord pays the fines; Stark, who did not reply to requests for comment, has not paid program fees in several years, according to records from the city\u2019s Department of Finance.) Even the worst the city has to offer, jail, didn\u2019t lead to reform. Meanwhile, tenants get stuck with hazardous conditions, as both the landlord and the city fall short.\nB\nugs and broken boilers\nThe saga at 1422 Greene began in 2013, when Stark tried to evict a rent-stabilized tenant. But after investigators found he had committed food stamp and Medicaid fraud, the case unraveled and Stark served a 14-month prison sentence. In 2020, while he was in prison, tenants carried out a rent strike over neglected repairs. The following year, the city\u2019s Alternative Enforcement Program took over, which meant more inspections, fees and sometimes the ability to make repairs at the landlord\u2019s expense.\nStark\u2019s\n2023 stint in jail\nstill led to no reform. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing any work,\u201d Michael Grinthal, a lawyer who represents the Greene Avenue tenants, said. When anything gets fixed, it\u2019s almost always by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, he said.\nThe property, a three-story building with white clapboard siding and 12 tenants, now has 79 open violations, of which 32 are deemed immediately hazardous. Stark also owes the city more than $140,000 in property tax and charges for emergency work, which included repairing the front door and replacing the boiler. Tenants say they still had to pay about $10,000 to keep gas running themselves.\n\u201cWe essentially run the building on our own,\u201d a representative for the 1422 Greene Avenue Tenants Association said. \u201cAny issues that come up, we deal with with our own funds or through working with the city. They\u2019re a mile wide and an inch deep, not well-funded enough to actually deliver on their missions.\u201d\n\u201cThe safety of New Yorkers is always our top priority, and through the Alternative Enforcement Program, HPD is able to conduct frequent inspections, work directly with tenants, issue violations, and, in some cases, carry out emergency repairs to quickly restore safe, stable living conditions,\u201d a spokesperson emailed.\nStark\u2019s other properties have similar problems. Three buildings on Hancock Street looked in disrepair during a recent visit. Tenants at 1335 Hancock say that Stark has abdicated. \u201cWe clean, we sweep, we take out the garbage,\u201d said a current tenant. \u201cWe do everything.\u201d The building has 77 open violations, including roach infestations, inadequate hot water and broken radiators, even though it too is in the city\u2019s Alternative Enforcement Program.\nBefore Stark stopped showing up, a tenant said that he would often barge into their apartment and take bottles of water from the refrigerator. The entryway is plastered with HPD notices of violation and unopened letters to Stark.\nNext door at 1339 Hancock, where the city now also oversees repairs, one tenant runs electricity into his apartment with an extension cord plugged into the hallway. A Con Edison notice warns service could be cut off because the landlord hasn\u2019t paid his bills. The front door hangs broken, and tenants have installed their own cameras for safety. The building has 138 open violations, 46 immediately hazardous. Across the street at 1336 Hancock, there are 139 more violations. (These are figures from mid-September, but violation count can fluctuate.)\nThe number of violations in Stark\u2019s buildings outstrips that of comparable buildings. Rent-stabilized units typically have about one or two deficiencies; even NYCHA units, long derided as some of the worst housing in New York, average 2.4. Stark\u2019s Bushwick buildings average 5.6 immediately hazardous violations or 18 overall violations per unit.\nN\no easy fix\nIn cases like Stark\u2019s, where an owner refuses to cooperate or pay bills, the city\u2019s enforcement program can fall short too. \u201c[The Alternative Enforcement Program] is about getting the landlord to clear violations, not about being a landlord,\u201d Grinthal, the tenant lawyer, said.\nThe housing department said it does try to stay involved when it is needed: \u201cWe will continue to monitor these buildings closely and use every tool available to hold the owner accountable as we work to ensure that every New Yorker has a safe, affordable place to call home,\u201d a spokesperson for HPD wrote.\nThe broader financial pressures of rent stabilization can help explain why some landlords abandon repairs. Because the 2019 law limited rent increases, many owners say they\nno longer earn\nenough to cover upkeep. Stark may be an extreme case, but he may not be as far from the average as first appears.\n\u201cIt\u2019s financial suicide to keep fixing things,\u201d Shaun Riney, a multifamily broker at Marcus &amp; Millichap, said about rent-stabilized operations. \u201cThere\u2019s no hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf someone was forcing you to show up to work every day, and not only were you not getting paid anything, but you were losing money by showing up to work every day, eventually you just lose your mind and you give up,\u201d Riney added.\nTo be sure, even among rent-stabilized landlords, most have no more than a quarter of the violations that Stark does.\nAnd, the Alternative Enforcement Program can work: More than half of the 2,630 buildings discharged from the program since its inception in 2007 were brought into compliance before the city had to issue a correction order, the HPD spokesperson said, adding that eligible owners whose buildings are in the enforcement program can apply for low-interest loans for moderate to major renovations.\nBut Stark\u2019s buildings illustrate how little difference any regulation can make when a landlord refuses to cooperate. Buildings belonging to Daniel Ohebshalom, one of the only other landlords in the city to be jailed for failing to make repairs, are also in the program, but a legal representative for Ohebshalom\u2019s tenants said that there was no marked difference on the ground before and after the buildings entered the city\u2019s purview.\n\u201cIf you asked the tenants today, they would say, \u2018We have no idea what it means to be in the AEP program,\u2019\u201d said Rebecca Whedon, a lawyer in the Tenants Rights Coalition at Legal Services NYC who represents Ohebshalom\u2019s tenants. \u201c\u2018We don\u2019t see any difference. We still feel abandoned by the city and the landlord.\u2019\u201d\nBecause buildings like Stark\u2019s have lost so much of their value since 2019, it\u2019s almost impossible to sell them. For a distressed property, especially one in the city-run enforcement program, to be sold, the price would need to be a fraction of what the owner originally paid, and \u201cit has to go through this long and painful ride of foreclosures and tax liens,\u201d Riney said.\nL\nast resort\nNew York City has one last weapon against negligent landlords: the tax lien sale.\nProperties with lots of tax owed or unpaid bills can end up on a lien sale list. If that happens, a private trust takes on the debt and charges the owner high interest. Then, if the owner doesn\u2019t pay, the trust forecloses and takes control of the property.\nUsually, the threat of a tax lien sale motivates a landlord to make repairs or pay up. If the building has a traditional bank mortgage, its lender is also paying attention because unpaid liens can wipe out the bank\u2019s collateral.\nBut Stark doesn\u2019t have a conventional lender.\nProperty records for all four buildings show that in 2019, the mortgages were sold to 189 Hart LLC, which lists its address as 156 Adar Court.\nThe LLC that owns the Hancock Street apartments has an address of 152 Adar Court, according to records of the 2007 purchase by 1335 Hancock St LLC, of which Stark is the managing member.\nBut both addresses appear to refer to the same building, a seven-bedroom house in Monsey, New York, according to Zillow. It is currently owned by Rgp Equities LLC, which bought it for $10 in 2014 from \u201cStark Ignat M.\u201d During his fraud case, Aron said the house was owned by a relative that he has never met.\nWhatever the exact relationship of Stark to his lender on these four mortgages, without a bank the usual leverage of a lien sale is weaker, with less financial pressure pushing him to make repairs or pay off debts.\nIn this case, neither owner nor lender appeared to care much about holding on to the buildings, and tax liens for all three Hancock properties were sold in June, though tenants worry a new owner might not improve conditions. At the Greene Avenue property, tenants successfully fought to keep their building off the tax lien sale list, fearing another slumlord.\nThe only other real method of enforcement in cases like Stark\u2019s is litigation. The city sued Stark, and won, in the Greene Avenue building case \u2014 but enforcing the judgment is a different ballgame. Residents are still trying to receive the damages they\u2019re owed.\nTenants \u201cdon\u2019t really see a ton of value in going back to court because they already did that and they won and it didn\u2019t bring about justice,\u201d said Grinthal, the tenant lawyer. \u201cRight now I think we\u2019re all trying to figure out what direction to go.\u201d\nAt Greene Avenue, the group of residents is hoping to form a co-op to take over ownership of the building. This is at a standstill since they say Stark won\u2019t show up to negotiate a sale. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to negotiate legally and financially when someone\u2019s not there,\u201d said the representative. \u201cHe\u2019s not shown up to a single hearing or a single milestone in the last five years.\u201d\nWhile Stark has been absent at his Bushwick properties, he hasn\u2019t fallen off the map completely and doesn\u2019t seem deterred from the real estate business. Property records show that in 2024, he purchased a multi-family building in Harlem for $6.8 million (which currently has 97 open violations).\n\u201cYou would think that someone who is so egregious would face some sort of accountability, but he\u2019s essentially living his life normally,\u201d the tenant association rep said.",

        "content": "Sam Rubin is used to working quick. Now he\u2019s working quicker.\nThe developer has four projects that qualify for 421a, New York\u2019s former tax exemption program. But a deadline is looming: June 15, 2026.\nRubin, head of Rubin Equities, is building in Mott Haven and Sunset Park, and he has eight months to finish construction. He\u2019s hiring pricier contractors to get work done fast, with more people at each job site. He estimates that he\u2019s spending about 10 percent more than he would on a typical project.\nBut missing the deadline would be even more expensive.\n\u201cThat\u2019s basically the difference between making money and not making money,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, it will take us a lot of time to recoup the investments.\u201d\nThe tax exemption expired in 2022, but last year New York lawmakers threw developers a lifeline. They passed a housing deal that gave the real estate industry five more years to complete construction and qualify their projects for the 421a program.\nBut facing political criticism, legislators\nrequired deeper affordability\nfor developments taking the extension. You can have more time, the state seemed to be saying to developers, but you won\u2019t get more flexibility.\n\u201cIf those owners are not going to\nget their act together\nright now, they\u2019re going to lose the project\u2019s value altogether,\u201d Eli Guttman, a tax abatement specialist at Metropolitan Realty Exemptions,\ntold\nThe Real Deal\nat the time, speaking about how to value 421a development sites.\nBut a year or two isn\u2019t long in the building world, and despite the extension, some smaller developers are still racing against the clock to finish their projects, hoping to be some of the last in the city to receive the implicit subsidy for building middle-income housing. Their scramble to finish isn\u2019t just about developers navigating the end of a complex tax break. It\u2019s also about the discord of a program that served many masters, pleased few of them and left a legacy of more than 100,000 units of housing in a city starved for supply.\nA\nffordable to whom?\nThe 421a program, though popular among builders, got a lot of criticism. With New York rents topping national lists, what was the use, critics asked, of subsidizing market-rate housing?\nAnd despite affordability requirements that grew with each iteration of the program, 421a was at its heart a subsidy for mixed-income and market-rate housing. Developers\u2019 favorite flavor of the program, known as Option C in the paperwork, most recently allowed them access to a 25-year tax exemption if they set aside 30 percent of units for households earning 130 percent of the area median income. Though the units were called \u201caffordable,\u201d in many places, the rent was just as expensive as the market rate.\n\u201cThere\u2019s \u2018trying\u2019 and then there\u2019s something called \u2018really trying.\u2019\u201d\nEli Guttman, tax abatement specialist\nThe income requirement was so high that developers sometimes struggled to fill the units, according to Sean Kelly, a partner and broker at Ariel Property Advisors. Applicants, who sometimes made six figures, needed to jump through bureaucratic hoops like asset checks, all to spend up to 30 percent of their income on rent.\nBut developers still flocked to the option, lured by high rents they could charge for the \u2018affordable\u2019 units. A 2022 analysis by the city comptroller\u2019s office found that 94 percent of projects in the program were pursuing that middle-income track, rather than options geared towards affordability for lower-income residents.\nThe ability to target 130 percent AMI under the \u201caffordable\u201d umbrella shifted the public\u2019s perspective towards skepticism.\n\u201cWhen New Yorkers say, \u2018Affordable to whom?\u2019 often it\u2019s a response to those 421a, 130 percent AMI units,\u201d Kim Darga, deputy commissioner of development for the city\u2019s housing arm, said at a technical briefing in August.\nE\night-month sprint\nResponding to that criticism, the state eliminated the 130 percent AMI option when it extended the construction deadline in April of last year.\nDevelopers who miss the deadline will only get the extension if they choose a different option. Most are going for Option B, which involves setting aside 10 percent of their units to target 70 percent AMI, while leaving 20 percent at the 130 option. In other words, the \u201caffordable\u201d units will bring in less rent than expected. Because market rates are unknown, it\u2019s difficult to estimate the effect this change will have on a bottom line. But if a project isn\u2019t bringing in the cash flow it predicted, refinancing can become tricky, real estate experts said.\nLosing access to the 130 option could mean a 10 to 15 percent drop in the value of a 421a project\u2019s land, said Kelly, at Ariel Property Advisors.\nJavier Martinez, head of\nArtifact Real Estate Development Company\n, is moving to finish three buildings in Upper Manhattan before the 2026 deadline. All are Option C, with the 130 percent median income threshold.\nMartinez said the projects, totaling 218 units, are in a comfortable place to meet the deadline. Although the developments would survive if they missed it, there would still be a \u201csignificant\u201d impact, he said. Rent increases at the affordable 421a units are governed by the Rent Guidelines Board while the building receives tax benefits, meaning the difference between 70 percent AMI and 130 percent will be felt for decades. And in neighborhoods like Washington Heights and Harlem, where rents are already less expensive, a developer can\u2019t necessarily hike up rents for market-rate units to make up the cash flow difference.\n\u201cIn this type of environment, where interest rates are so high and costs are so high, every little bit counts,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cIf you have projects you can\u2019t finance, then you can\u2019t go to the next one. You can\u2019t build more.\u201d\nGuttman, of Metropolitan Realty Exemptions, says developers like Rubin and Martinez are not alone in trying to save Option C for their projects. He gets calls multiple times per week from developers who are pushing their contractors and hoping to find any way around the deadline.\n\u201cThere is definitely a pressure going on on the development side to make sure to meet that deadline,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s \u2018trying\u2019 and then there\u2019s something called \u2018really trying.\u2019\u201d\nAnd the more expensive the neighborhood, the more it\u2019s worth it to try. The lower income restriction is a bigger hit to the rent roll in, say, downtown Brooklyn than in the Bronx, Guttman said.\nGuttman is working with Yitz Kaufman, COO of KS Group, on a large-scale development in Astoria. Kaufman has cut several months off the timeline for the 738-unit project, called Astoria Cove, hoping to score the 130 percent AMI option, and spending more to do it.\n\u201cThat\u2019s basically the difference between making money and not making money.\u201d\nSam Rubin, Rubin Equities\n\nHe knows that if the KS Group team doesn\u2019t make the deadline, the finances will take a hit, Kaufman said, but he doesn\u2019t know quite how much.\n\u201cHopefully that question will be hypothetical,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause hopefully we will be able to do it.\u201d\nSome back-of-the-napkin math gives a taste. Based on other developments in Astoria that have taken the middle-income track, studios for households at 130 percent of AMI list for $2,900 per month and two-bedrooms for $3,500. A resident making 70 percent AMI could pay something like $500, or even $1,000, less per month for either, according to a review of units available in the housing lottery compared to maximums set by the city. Multiplied across 10 percent of a large project, that could be a big hit, which a landlord could either absorb, or try to make up by raising rents on market-rate units.\nThat may not be make or break. Martinez and Kaufman said they are both planning to use the deadline extension for other developments, forgoing the 130 percent AMI.\n\u201cThere\u2019s obviously a financial incentive to finish earlier,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cBut the bigger financial incentive is just finishing the projects.\u201d\n\u2018\nYou either get it or you don\u2019t\u2019\nNot every developer is feeling the crunch. Big institutional players have mostly finished their 421a projects, they told\nTRD\n.\nSome other developers are working in zoning districts that have even steeper affordability requirements to build. Those players were overjoyed about the extension and unbothered by the disappearance of 130 percent AMI, since they weren\u2019t using it. That includes Charney Companies, which will have built 3,000 units under the 421a program by 2028, according to founder Sam Charney. The company is building on sites vested for 421a in recently rezoned Gowanus, where deeper affordability is required for big projects.\n\u201cIt was an unbelievable program,\u201d Charney said of 421a.\nThere were other big winners from the extension. Landowners, including those in the recently upzoned districts,\nsaw their assets jump in value\n. Suddenly, developers had the option to squeeze out the last drops of 421a before it was replaced with a less lucrative incentive program. Developers, some of whom were planning to make the original deadline, were also able to eke out some breathing room with lenders who had worried about missing the exemption entirely.\n\u201cProjects were not capable of getting financing without a certainty that they were going to be able to be completed in time,\u201d Brett Gottlieb, an attorney at Herrick, said. \u201cUntil the statute provided for the extension language, these projects were on hold. Some of them died permanently or were sold.\u201d\nBefore the deadline was announced, MAG Partners was working overtime. The development team, which builds in Manhattan, knew they could finish their projects by the 2026 deadline and access the tax exemption before it closed for good. The issue was convincing their funders. Lenders wanted assurances that projects could be completed significantly earlier.\n\u201cCapital markets and lenders really put a lot of cushion on the deadline,\u201d Jeffrey Rosen, chief investment officer at MAG Partners, said. \u201cThe end result of this is binary. You either get it or you don\u2019t.\u201d\nA\ntax exemption goes\nf\nrom rags to riches\nThe 421a program\u2019s transformation into an affordable housing program didn\u2019t happen all at once. The tax break\u2019s journey underscores New York City\u2019s transition from an emptying metropolis to arguably the most in-demand municipality in the country.\nIn the 1970s, the city hollowed out. The original 421a was a simple tax waiver for new multifamily rentals, marketed by Mayor John Lindsay as a way to spur investment. There was no affordability requirement because there was no need for one. Subsidizing middle- and upper-class taxpayers was the point.\nBut New York survived its doom loop, and by the \u201980s, development was making a comeback. Public opinion began to turn when\nDonald Trump\npushed for tens of millions of dollars in tax breaks through the program for his Fifth Avenue tower, full of luxury condos. When the program was up for one of its occasional renewals in 2006, New York\u2019s housing problem had firmly shifted from \u201cabandonment\u201d to \u201caffordability,\u201d as Michael Bloomberg put it. Critics blasted 421a for subsidizing luxury apartments in upscale neighborhoods.\nIn 2017, Mayor Bill de Blasio lobbied for all 421a buildings in the city to include affordable units. He got his wish, although with the highest-income option.\nDetractors have long focused on the program\u2019s cost, which reached $1.77 billion in foregone tax revenue in fiscal year 2022. The purported cost to the city of each affordable unit has reached more than $757,000, according to a report from the city comptroller\u2019s office.\nBut the real meaning of those numbers is complicated. Given how multifamily rental buildings are taxed in the city, most projects just don\u2019t work financially without some subsidy.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t pencil out a lot of property with full property taxes, given the construction costs and operating costs in this city,\u201d Mark Willis, a senior policy fellow at New York University\u2019s Furman Center, said.\nThe impact of the program has been so great that some real estate experts estimated there were few multifamily rental buildings constructed since the 1970s in New York that didn\u2019t have a tax exemption.\n\u201c421a is the gasoline that fuels multifamily rental construction in New York City,\u201d David Lombino of Two Trees said. \u201cWithout it, you don\u2019t have a multifamily development business in New York City.\u201d\nDevelopers have found 421a\u2019s replacement, 485x,\nuninspiring\n. \u201cBetter than nothing,\u201d as one broker described it.\nThe new program added another wrinkle to a developer\u2019s calculus: a construction wage minimum that kicks in at 100 units. The rate, $40 per hour, makes large buildings extremely difficult to pencil out, prompting many developers to target exactly 99 units.\n\u201c421a was like a very special vintage of wine,\u201d Ethan Stanton, senior managing director at JLL, said via email. \u201cThe sites we still have, whether they\u2019re under contract or on the market, are the only ones left in that case.\u201d\nUnless the wine passes its prime: Sites that have started construction under 421a but can\u2019t finish before the deadline won\u2019t be able to access 485x unless they rip up foundations and restart, according to Daniel Bernstein, an attorney at Rosenberg &amp; Estis.\nNot every developer is looking so far ahead just yet. While 421a is still here, they plan to make the most of it.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no second bite at the apple,\u201d Martinez said.",

        "content": "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac blocked the sale of a beleaguered condo complex in Pembroke Pines.\nThe companies\u2019 temporary injunction essentially halts the planned sale of Heron Pond in western Broward County that\u2019s been in the works for a year. It also puts on hold the planned distribution of proceeds to unit owners. A court-appointed receiver had determined that a sale was the best course of action due to structural safety concerns. The complex was evacuated last year.\nOn Friday, receiver Daniel Stermer designated Miami-based Integra Real Estate as the purchaser of the 25-acre complex with 19 two-story lakefront buildings at 8400 Southwest First Street. Integra had\noffered $20.5 million\nlast month for Heron Pond as the stalking horse bidder,\u00a0 setting the floor price should it have gone to auction.\nAn auction scheduled for last Thursday was canceled because no additional qualifying bids were submitted by the deadline of last Tuesday.\nUnder the current zoning, Integra \u2013\u2013 led by Nelson Stabile, Paulo Tavares de Melo, Victor Ballestas and Cory Yeffet \u2013\u2013 would be able to build a 321-unit project with one or multiple buildings up to eight stories or 100 feet tall, whichever is less.\nBut the sale process is on hold. Federal Judge Judge Rodney Smith in Fort Lauderdale on Thursday granted Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2019s emergency motion for a temporary restraining order. It is in effect until a scheduled hearing in front of Smith on Oct. 9.\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2019s argument is based on federal law that bans the sale of property that serves as collateral for a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loan without the consent of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.\nFannie and Freddie hold first position liens on eight of the condos at Heron Pond, according to their motion filed on Wednesday of last week, one day before the canceled auction.\n\nIn court filings, Fannie and Freddie argue that because they are under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, any action that would impair the agency\u2019s power is banned, according to the Wednesday filing. Freddie and Fannie\u2019s motion to halt the sale is partly based on the argument that FHFA \u201cmust consent before any sale takes place,\u201d according to their court filing.\nStermer took over as\nreceiver\nlast year after Pembroke Pines city officials issued multiple notices of violations of the Florida building and fire codes at some of the buildings. Some unit owners also had alleged mismanagement by prior board members.\nPrior to Stermer\u2019s appointment, 122 units had been evacuated. Last August, all remaining units were evacuated after engineers working on repairs found additional structural deficiencies in buildings. Stermer decided to sell the property after he determined that assessments of damage and repair costs prior to his appointment were \u201csignificantly inadequate to assess the true nature, scope, and extent of the damage facing the association,\u201d he said in court filings.\nSince then, the court granted Stermer\u2019s request to terminate the condo form of governance and to proceed with the marketing and sale. In a statement,\nStermer\nwrote that the sale can\u2019t occur until the court rules or the parties resolve their issues. \u201cWe look forward to resolving the removal action and moving forward with the sale of the property as quickly as possible,\u201d Stermer said.\nIn his report to the court last month, Stermer wrote that the issue boils down to Fannie and Freddie asserting that \u201cunless they are paid in full from the sale \u2026 they will not consent to the sale.\u201d Essentially, this means that they are asking that sale proceeds designated for unit owners, including those with no mortgages on their condos, are first used to pay back Fannie and Freddie in full.\nThis will reduce \u201cthe pro rata share to be distributed to each unit owner,\u201d Stermer wrote.\nThe sale to Integra would break down to $67,434 per unit.\nRecords show one of the two Freddie mortgage loans on a Heron Pond unit is $132,000; and some of the Fannie mortgages range from the high $100,000s to over $300,000, though that\u2019s the amount lent and doesn\u2019t include how much has been paid off.\n",

        "content": "Live by the beach long enough, and you start to ignore the red and yellow flags that come and go with the tides. Those playing in the sandbox that is South Florida\u2019s real estate market today find the signs of danger almost invisible, and talk in the region still focuses on its great performance, especially compared to the rest of the country.\nBut yellow flags that have been waving for a while are now threatening to turn red, as economic factors suggest storms. Macro indicators that include inflation, the widening wealth gap and the Trump administration\u2019s trade and immigration policies are leading to pullbacks and hesitation for some, even if it remains below the surface of the market. \u201cWhether it\u2019s on the way to recession or just weakening, I don\u2019t know,\u201d JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said of weak jobs numbers. In May, his firm\u2019s data put the probability of a recession by the end of the year at 40 percent.\nOn the\ncondo front\nin South Florida, the \u201ccuspy\u201d projects, as capital markets broker Scott Wadler describes them, are taking longer to sell. Some will be canceled, he said. At others, developers have had to kick in more equity or find partners to fill the gap.\n\u201cI have a couple of projects that are under-capitalized from an equity perspective,\u201d he added. \u201c[Developers] want too much leverage. Their rents are aggressive, and there\u2019s a lack of equity in the marketplace,\u201d Wadler, managing director of Berkadia\u2019s Miami office, said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that means that there\u2019s going to be a recession. I think that means that equity has been tough to find, and it\u2019s still tough to find.\u201d\nThe\noffice\nand\nmultifamily\nsectors have already experienced their fair share of pain, caused by high interest rates and construction costs, as well as supply outweighing demand. A number of office projects were canceled or put on hold in South Florida\u2019s urban cores, and suburban office is even weaker, as companies quashed planned expansions or halted hiring. Multifamily developers are looking to sell their sites, especially those with maturity dates looming and no other option in sight.\nRestaurants\n, a bellwether for consumer spending, have also suffered.\nH\narbingers\nProjects that sold out in better times have been delivered late or are still delayed, costing developers additional interest and frustrating buyers. Other more recently launched developments are struggling to capture enough presales.\nSome condo developers, brokerages and agents have eliminated or reduced their public relations budgets. Sales directors on new developments have seen their projects get entirely value re-engineered by their developers. This is tough news to deliver to buyers who already have contracts signed. It\u2019s also difficult to sell to new buyers.\nAnd then there are the projects that have continued to sell, but where the developer needs more capital.\nWadler described a project in Palm Beach Gardens that\u2019s under construction. The deal, he said, isn\u2019t in distress. It has the presales needed to move forward.\n\u201cMiami is not New York. It\u2019s not Paris. It\u2019s not L.A. Shit here runs different.\u201d\nFelix Bendersky, restaurant broker\n\u201cThe project is a little delayed, and it\u2019s a large project, so [the developer] needs to rebalance the deal, which is happening to a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s taking them an extra year, and on a big project with a big interest rate, you know, it could cost an extra $15, $20 million to rebalance the deal and pay extension fees.\u201d\nWadler and others insist that the majority of projects are selling and able to secure financing.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s fair or legitimate necessarily to tie that to a specific recession or market dynamic,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many projects that I\u2019m working on that are successfully obtaining financing and are oversubscribed.\u201d\nOn the office front, Swire Properties canceled its plans for One Brickell City Centre, a Class A office tower that would have some of the largest floor plates in Brickell, in January. Swire sold the site to Melo Group, which will likely build a mixed-use residential project. Smaller office projects were shelved by other developers: In September, Michael Shvo sold his office site at 1680 Alton Road in Miami Beach via a deed-in-lieu-of-foreclosure to Infinity Collective.\nMultifamily developers are also looking to move on. James Curnin\u2019s Clara Homes made a splash when it acquired a site in Wynwood that fronts the highway. Curnin secured approval for a Live Local Act apartment tower only to list the property for sale this summer. An oversupply of market rentals has put pressure on rents.\nBut locals are being squeezed out. The challenges of living and working in South Florida, including traffic, flooding and the high cost of living, have gotten worse. A majority of the population is also living in aging buildings that require significant financial investments.\n\u201cPeople are struggling to pay their rent. People who missed the window to lock in a great mortgage or to buy a house, now they\u2019re spending an inordinate amount of their income on rent, and inflation is killing everyone because a sandwich and a coffee cost $10,\u201d Wadler said.\nA number of experts have sounded the alarm on the widening wealth gap that\u2019s bifurcating the market.\n\u201cThe \u2018haves,\u2019 they have fixed-rate debt, and they were just lucky, and they\u2019re in the right place. And there are businesses that are flourishing,\u201d Wadler said. Including his. \u201cThe real estate capital markets [sector] is very active right now. I would make a general statement to say that a lot of brokers, maybe not on the sales side, but the capital markets financing brokers, year-over-year, all did better.\u201d\n\nThe \u201clarger economic reality\u201d might be evident in restaurant closures, according to Ben Wolkov, an attorney who\u2019s managing partner at Miami-based Caldera Law. Caldera\u2019s clients include the ever-successful Sunny\u2019s Steakhouse in Miami\u2019s Little River.\nBut unlike Sunny\u2019s, which continues to do well, dozens of restaurants closed over the summer, typically the hardest and slowest season for the industry. The closures include RedFarm, an upscale Chinese restaurant from New York that was open in Coconut Grove for only a year, and Miami Beach staple Sardinia, which was in the community for two decades.\nWolkov called it a \u201cperfect storm.\u201d Though some have pulled off major success, restaurants in general are also dealing with high costs of food and insurance.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the return of seasonality overlaid with macroeconomic and other factors unique to this particular summer,\u201d he said. \u201cFrame that against cash flow practices. For some restaurants, that\u2019s been a fatal blow.\u201d\nRestaurant owners also suffer from another Miami-specific problem that costs residential and commercial developers time and money they sometimes don\u2019t have: an especially lengthy permit process.\n\u201cMiami is not New York. It\u2019s not Paris. It\u2019s not L.A. Shit here runs different,\u201d restaurant broker Felix Bendersky said on a recent episode of his podcast. \u201cAnd if they don\u2019t know how to navigate, there\u2019s a good chance that they\u2019re going to be closed before they open. Just because it works somewhere else, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to work in Miami.\u201d\nM\nore than hope\nThe red flags shouldn\u2019t be misinterpreted as a sure disaster. Despite the potential of a downturn, a number of residential projects are moving forward simply because demand still exists. New residents continue to move to the state, and the region\u2019s retail and industrial markets paint a picture of a region still outperforming other major U.S. metros.\nAnd money still pours in.\nThe massive wave of wealth that moved into South Florida as a result of the pandemic has fundamentally altered the region\u2019s demographics. Billionaires, including South Florida natives Ken Griffin and Steve Ross, as well as international retail magnate Amancio Ortega, have dropped hundreds of millions of dollars on real estate and the local economies. Griffin relocated his hedge fund and sister financial firm, Citadel and Citadel Securities, from Chicago to Miami.\nGriffin has contributed more than $300 million since 2022, and he recently announced a $50 million gift to Success Academy, a New York City charter school network, at a joint press conference with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\nOrtega, the third wealthiest person in the world, has been growing his real estate portfolio. In recent months, his family office Ponte Gadea paid about $110 million for Atlas Plaza, an anchor property in Miami\u2019s Design District that\u2019s home to Michael Schwartz\u2019s Michael\u2019s Genuine Food &amp; Drink, one of the longest operating restaurants in the neighborhood.\nPonte Gadea is under contract to buy Sabadell Financial Center, a 30-story office tower in Miami\u2019s Brickell neighborhood, for $275 million.\nA drove of multimillionaires has followed the billionaires. If the wealth migration has slowed, it certainly hasn\u2019t stopped.\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve\u2019s\nrecent reduction in interest rates\nis floating the real estate world.\nBH Group\u2019s Isaac Toledano, a developer who\u2019s partnered with condo juggernaut the Related Group, Dezer Development, Kolter Group and others, said he\u2019s more optimistic now than he was a year ago, after the election put a lot of buyers, sellers and developers on hold. Even once activity picked up after the election, it slowed again because of President Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nToledano is bullish on 2026, across sectors.\nMost agree that the local real estate market won\u2019t experience the lowest lows of 2008. Although it\u2019s been difficult to secure financing, a number of condo, mixed-use and multifamily developers have closed on significant loans.\nCommercial leases also continue to be signed. For many of the restaurants that do close, a new tenant is ready to come in and take the space.\n\u201cNext year, you\u2019re going to be able to borrow money at about 5 percent. I think a lot of buyers sitting on the sidelines will start to be more active,\u201d Toledano said. \u201cRemember, everyone thought what we saw during Covid was going to last forever. Things usually change.\u201d",

        "content": "When one of south Miami-Dade County\u2019s sprawling suburbs ends, the landscape changes. Streets of master-planned communities level off into a vast expanse of open land and row crops that stretch into the horizon for a mile and a half, west toward Krome Avenue and Everglades National Park.\nThis is where, on a nearly 1,000-acre tract, homebuilding giant Lennar wants to build a mega-subdivision: homes, jobs, schools and entertainment.\nIn business-friendly Miami-Dade, government officials for years have catered to developers in an ongoing bid for new towers, complexes and homes. With real estate a major economic driver and tax base for the county, developers rarely hear no from electeds and sometimes\nget help\nto work around difficult sites and zonings.\nBut even Miami-Dade has its limits. The site Lennar  wants to develop,\nCity Park\nis outside what\u2019s known as the Urban Development Boundary. Past the line, development is strictly banned. This summer Lennar filed its application for 7,800 homes and 2.4 million square feet of commercial space.\nConstruction beyond the limit may be impossible, but as it turns out, the boundary itself is movable, if a developer can pass county and state administrative reviews, secure a supermajority commission vote and survive a potential mayoral veto, all while environmentalists lobby against the annexation of farmland and wetlands, which creep closer to protected national parks.\nIt isn\u2019t the first to embark on this quest. A pair of developers won approval to move the line in 2022 \u2014 following five public hearings where they capitulated to commissioners\u2019 many demands and halved their project size. But their plan was quashed in court, a warning that even hard-won victories can collapse before the end.\nBut if Lennar figures it out, City Park would be the single largest proposed project in the area and solidify its remaking of south Miami-Dade. It might also indicate a new upper limit of what developers can pull off here.\nThe Miami-Dade-based homebuilding giant has honed a machine-like business strategy of \u201cstarts, sales, deliveries\u201d that\u2019s made it the country\u2019s second-largest homebuilder \u2014 and the dominant force in this corner of the county. Since 2020, Lennar has delivered 8,430 single-family houses and townhomes in south Miami-Dade, nearly 70 percent of all such units built in that period, according to Colliers Research. Currently, it\u2019s building 840 more homes in the area. That accounts for almost 60 percent of the housing stock under construction.\nEven without taking the 7,800 residential units of City Park into account, Lennar plans nearly half of the proposed south Miami-Dade units, or 3,569 out of the 7,682 total, the Colliers data shows.\n\u201cThey are by far dominant,\u201d\nEd Easton\n, founder of Miami-based\nEaston Group\nand partner in City Park, said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question.\u201d\nNow, slowing sales and dropping prices, as well as stubbornly elevated construction costs and interest rates, have many pulling back from south Miami-Dade. Yet, Lennar, which also is experiencing a decline in sales and revenue from its nationwide portfolio, is only pressing on.\nH\nome base\nDuring South Florida\u2019s housing boom of the past five years, fueled by an influx of out-of-staters, builders raced south. Far from the construction cranes in Miami\u2019s booming Brickell and Edgewater neighborhoods, Coral Gables\u2019 Mediterranean Revival buildings and Pinecrest\u2019s manicured lawns, south Miami-Dade has one thing those areas don\u2019t: cheap land.\nLennar has been developing in the area, which consists of the municipalities of Homestead and Florida City, as well as unincorporated county neighborhoods such as Leisure City, Naranja, Princeton, Goulds, Redland and South Miami Heights, since at least the early 2000s.\nBut it ramped up recently. From 2020 to last year, Lennar completed the Siena Reserve community with roughly 1,200 single-family and townhomes spanning across Goulds and Princeton, according to property records. From 2019 to 2022, it completed the Campo Bello community with about 500 homes near Princeton; and from 2021 to last year, it finished Caple Farms North with over 200 homes near Cutler Bay.\nThe Simpsons-esque subdivisions are easy to spot, with their brand-new streets of cookie-cutter houses \u2014 three or four bedrooms, up to 2,000 square feet, selling in the $400,000-to-$600,000 range. Here, working families can have their own backyard and community amenities like pools and gyms.\nThe late Leonard Miller, a Miami-Dade landowner, sowed the seeds for Lennar\u2019s start here in the 1950s when he leveraged his land and $10,000 to partner with Arnold Rosen\u2019s F&amp;R Builders. By 1971, the pair had renamed the company to Lennar and taken it public. Over the decades, Lennar grew not just through its efficient homebuilding but also by acquiring existing homebuilders, giving it a nationwide foothold, and expanding its business lines into mortgage lending, title and insurance services, as well as a LenX proptech arm during the smart homes craze in 2018. The company\u2019s mantra is \u201cevolve or die,\u201d Stuart Miller, Leonard Miller\u2019s son, famously said. The younger Miller took the helm of Lennar in 1997 and leads the firm as co-CEO with Jon Jaffe. Leonard Miller died in 2002.\n\u201cBy having [developable land] on someone else\u2019s balance sheet, you are freeing your cash flow to do whatever you do best. Lennar is best at being very efficient in building again and again and again.\u201d\nEli Beracha, professor of real estate and finance at Florida International University\nLennar also seized on down markets, spinning off distressed commercial mortgage investment arms LNR and\nRialto Capital\n, eventually divesting its majority stake in both. It also launched multifamily division Quarterra, which it still owns.\nIn Miami-Dade, the Miller family has a reputation as top benefactors, with Stuart and his siblings, Leslie and Jeffrey, continuing their parents\u2019 legacy, including for homeless and medical research causes. (University of Miami\u2019s medical school was named for Leonard Miller, following a historic $100 million gift from the family in 2004.)\nFor all its scale, Lennar has kept a low profile. Unlike many Miami builders who spotlight every project milestone, Lennar rarely trumpets its projects beyond email blasts about planned or completed communities. The company declined to make a representative available for this story and generally hasn\u2019t responded to sporadic The Real Deal inquiries over the past couple of years regarding projects. Not all the press is good: Allegations of shoddy construction have been the most persistent blemish on Lennar\u2019s reputation, especially after Category 5 Hurricane Andrew pummeled south Miami-Dade in 1992 and homeowners alleged poor construction that failed to meet the state code. The homebuilder settled homeowners\u2019 class action suit for $2.4 million, denying any wrongdoing.\nLennar\u2019s move on south Miami-Dade also doesn\u2019t seem to have been explicitly announced or addressed, publicly or internally.\n\u201cI don\u2019t ever recall having that specific discussion, saying, \u2018Hey, we are going to target south Dade,\u201d Anthony Seijas, a former regional VP at Lennar in the early 2000s, said. \u201cIt started building communities in Homestead when I was there. It just became a natural progression [to] where there\u2019s land to build master-planned communities.\u201d\nAmid the rush on south Miami-Dade, development sites large enough for master-planned communities dwindled, leaving one area as the obvious place for Lennar to turn to: outside the UDB. The 990-acre site where City Park is proposed is \u201cadjacent to the Urban Development Boundary, making it the natural next place for growth,\u201d a project spokesperson said.\nIn the meantime, Lennar had done smaller projects within the UDB: In Redland, a proposed 97 homes; in the Goulds area, a project of 138 homes and another nearby with 54 homes; and in South Miami Heights, a complex with 24 single-family homes.\nH\now to build a resi empire\nBut Lennar\u2019s residential empire in south Miami-Dade rests less on bricks and mortar than on savvy land tactics. The builder has locked in developable sites for years ahead, cementing its near-monopoly and its main role in the future of the area\u2019s housing market.\nTake the palm nursery in Princeton, a half mile from the development boundary.The homebuilder doesn\u2019t own the land for a planned development where Lennar wants to build\n257 homes\n.\nYet, in a move typical for the firm, Lennar knows it can have the land when it wants it. In June, TPG Angelo Gordon paid $30.2 million for the property, not to own it, but rather to hold it for Lennar until it\u2019s ready to build, records show.\nAs such, TPG Angelo Gordon, a private equity firm, acts as a land bank for Lennar, purchasing, holding and preparing sites for construction until Lennar is ready to buy the plots and start building. Lennar\u2019s other land bank partners include New York-based JEN Partners, which paid\n$19.6 million\nfor a 19-acre site planned for 302 homes in Princeton; and Scottsdale, Arizona-based Garrett Development, which paid\n$20.4 million\nfor the 39-acre Florida City site where Lennar is now developing Le Jardine townhouse complex with 527 homes.\nIn the biggest nod to its strategy, Lennar this year\nspun off Millrose Properties,\nits own publicly traded land bank that enables the homebuilders\u2019 land-light strategy. Lennar put $5.5 billion worth of its land holdings and $1 billion in cash into Millrose. Through Millrose, Lennar already has expanded its south Miami-Dade development site stockpile.\nIn essence, Lennar outsources land ownership \u2014 the riskiest part of its empire building.\n\u201cBy having [developable land] on someone else\u2019s balance sheet, you are freeing your cash flow to do whatever you do best. Lennar is best at being very efficient in building again and again and again,\u201d Eli Beracha, a professor of real estate and finance at Florida International University, said.\nThe math is simple but powerful: Homebuilders pay a 15 percent to 20 percent deposit of the cost to land banks to get homesites ready for development. They also sign agreements to purchase the land. If it costs $100,000 to get 50 lots ready for development, a homebuilder working without a land bank ties up $5 million upfront just for the site preparation. But if the homebuilder uses a land bank, it would only pay $1 million to the land bank to get the lots ready (20 percent of the total cost) and then will have the rest of its capital free for construction, a land bank expert explained.\nFor Lennar, it\u2019s as much about efficiency as it is about optics. Because its land is off its books and sits with land banks, its financials look leaner to shareholders and its stock price isn\u2019t weighed down by non-income producing assets, Frank Schnidman, a retired economic development and urban planning professor at Florida Atlantic University, explained.\n\u201cThey are basically playing a shell game to move the property around to best benefit their balance sheet,\u201d he said.\n\nThe land, and Lennar\u2019s obligation to buy it from land banks, isn\u2019t hidden from shareholders, just less obvious, Beracha said.\n\u201cOf course it is a little bit less transparent of what is not on the balance sheet, so the shareholders need to be a little bit more sophisticated and realize \u2026 they [Lennar] have a separate liability,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a common practice.\u201d\nSouth Florida homebuilders generally focus on specific areas, in a way unofficially divvying up the tri-county region among themselves. While Kolter, Pulte and Kenco are primarily in parts of Palm Beach County, south Miami-Dade has long been the turf for Lennar and, for a long time, Arlington, Texas-based D.R. Horton.\nAlthough many south Miami-Dade market watchers call both Lennar and D.R. Horton the area\u2019s top players, data show D.R. Horton trailing Lennar by far. D.R. Horton completed 16 percent of the pipeline in the past half decade, and is responsible for 23 percent of the under-construction and proposed pipeline, the Colliers data shows.\n\u201cLennar is on the march,\u201d one south Miami-Dade tropical fruit farmer said, declining to be identified because he has a pending offer on his land from Lennar. \u201cD.R. Horton was around a lot but they have backed way off. They [Lennar] are gobbling up land everywhere you turn. There\u2019s not a person down there with land in the right area that they haven\u2019t run an offer by.\u201d\nMany south Miami-Dade farmers and nursery owners, with land holdings both inside and outside the UDB, aren\u2019t too keen to sell to Lennar, he said: Farmers want to be farmers. But sometimes, the economics of farming forces them to enter sale agreements with homebuilders.\nLandowners and residents are often against pushing the UDB, the tropical fruit farmer said. People there just \u201clike the low density.\u201d\nOne local landowner and developer cautioned his peers against entering sale agreements with any homebuilders.\nThe landowners are often locked into agreements and prices years before the homebuilder closes the deal, and by the time the builder buys, values may have soared \u2014 yet the farmer is bound to the old price, according Lewis Swezy, a south Miami-Dade landowner and affordable housing developer.\n\u201cA lot of these people aren\u2019t sophisticated sellers and they lock them in,\u201d Swezy said.\nB\noundary politics\nSometime in the 1980s, Easton, Lennar\u2019s partner in City Park, suggested to Leonard Miller that they purchase the land outside the boundary as a long-term investment. During the subsequent years, they assembled it in clumps, according to Easton.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t really talk about developing it at the time,\u201d Easton said.\nIn 2007, Lennar and Easton first filed a proposed project on the site, at the time called Parkland, with nearly 7,000 homes, a hospital and medical offices, retail, schools, warehouses and parks. By 2008, the project fizzled out after Miami-Dade administrators recommended denial, and the developers asked for a deferral of a commission vote, county records show. A City Park spokesperson cited the onset of the Great Financial Crisis.\nThe new City Park is a refreshed redesign of Parkland, a project spokesperson said.\nIt would consist of the 144-acre Village Core with shops, restaurants, a plaza and boardwalk; retail and offices; civic spaces; schools for up to 3,800 students and 250 acres of parks, lakes, a community farm and trails. The industrial space will include last-mile distribution centers and potentially support expected aerospace growth at nearby Miami Executive Airport.\nLennar and its project partners, Easton and homebuilding consultant Bill Albers, are in the early stages of approvals, a process that could drag into next year. Following their pre-application in July, they will file a formal application in the coming weeks, the project spokesperson said. Then, they will meet with commissioners, environmental groups, community members and other stakeholders, and will potentially fine-tune the proposal. Commissioners will vote several times, first on whether to transmit the application to the state.\nContention over the project is typical for Miami-Dade: build housing for the growing population or preserve remaining farmland.\nProponents say City Park would be a self-sustaining community and alleviate demand for attainably priced homes, especially for locals priced out of other areas. There would be 4,500 townhomes and 2,200 multifamily/live-work units, and 1,000 single-family homes. About 12.5 percent will be at workforce price or rents, which includes more than 300 affordable units.\nClose to 30,000 county residents are leaving annually, according to Jeffrey Bercow, a land use attorney for the City Park developers, often because they\u2019re priced out. Others make long commutes from affordable suburbs. City Park could be a place for people to work, as well as live, the project spokesperson underscores.\nSkeptics aren\u2019t convinced. \u201cIt would be a huge, huge mistake\u201d Miami-Dade Commissioner Roberto Gonzalez, whose district includes the City Park site, said, adding the planned office space isn\u2019t \u201cenough\u201d to create an employment hub. \u201cWhat we need is something that can alleviate traffic. Not more homes.\u201d\nThe project would continue a decadeslong practice of poor urban planning in Miami-Dade where homes are on one side of the county and jobs and entertainment on the other, causing traffic congestion, Gonzalez added. Developers also should consider land in the Urban Expansion Area, or the area that\u2019s designated for construction first before building elsewhere outside the UDB, Gonzalez said.\nMany south Miami-Dade farmers and nursery owners aren\u2019t too keen to sell to Lennar \u2026 farmers want to be farmers. But sometimes, the economics of farming forces them to enter sale agreements with homebuilders.\n\u201cOur internal rules make clear that we should not build outside that line [UDB] unless there is a need. There is no need,\u201d added Commissioner Danielle Cohen Higgins.\nSome environmentalists and preservationists argue that infill development, or building on developable sites on the right side of the UDB, is the best way to meet the housing needs of a growing population.\nThe county has land for about 230,000 residential units \u2014 with about 10 percent of that suitable for single-family homes and the rest for rentals, townhouses and condos. That\u2019s not enough, Bercow said.\n\u201cThe demand for single-family homes is pretty steady at about 5,500 units per year,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd with a 23,000 [single-family home] capacity, you are out in five years.\u201d\nThe would-be City Park site has no wetlands or other environmentally sensitive lands. Still, redeveloping it could destroy \u201cvaluable productive agriculture \u2026 battering\u201d Miami-Dade\u2019s endangered farming economy, according to Hold the Line, a longtime coalition of environmental groups that opposes most expansions beyond the boundary. A joint county-University of Florida 2023 study recommended keeping the UDB intact to preserve agricultural land.\nCurrently, the City Park land is leased for row crops and isn\u2019t part of the tropical fruit and nursery farms that the UF study listed \u201cas most critical to protect,\u201d a project spokesperson said.\nS\nhaky ground\nFor all the building, the south part of the county is still \u201cless tested\u201d of an area, broker Sebastian Faerman said. \u201cYou speak with new developers coming from outside Florida and they don\u2019t know it.\u201d\nWhen the real estate market slowed in recent months, some developers who had tried south Miami-Dade during the boom listed their sites for sale, walking back on their southbound exploration, Faerman said.\nHow much demand there is for homes in south Miami-Dade is also an open question, as the area is devoid from employment and entertainment hubs. Yet, because homebuilders can purchase land for cheap, they also can offer more attainable prices, providing residents priced out of most of Miami-Dade an alternative to leaving the county.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult choice for working families. They either buy an affordable single-family home in a community in south Dade and then drive for an hour or two to their workplace, or they move into a rental or a condominium multifamily project, which doesn\u2019t give them the same kind of amenities and space and community feeling they want,\u201d Bercow, the attorney, said.\n\u201cOr they move out of Miami-Dade County.\u201d\nIn the third quarter, Lennar reported a 9 percent drop in home sale revenues nationwide, as well as a drop in the average home sale price. As the top south Miami-Dade developer, the firm is most exposed to a slowdown in the local housing market. Yet if anyone can weather a downturn, it\u2019s Lennar, onlookers say, pointing to the Great Recession.\n\u201cThis is home base for them, so they understand this market probably better than anybody,\u201d David Burstyn, a Miami-Dade affordable housing developer and investor, said. \u201cStuart Miller is an industry genius. He knows what he is doing. He knows how to navigate a ship better than anybody.\u201d",

        "content": "For Martin Melo, a principal with\nMelo Group\n, a Miami-based development and general contracting firm, the past year signaled a winding down of the city\u2019s most recent development boom.\n\u201cI think we are at the end of the cycle for projects that began shortly after the pandemic,\u201d Melo told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cThere is still a lot of inventory being built in the [condo and apartment] sectors, but the market seems much calmer.\u201d\nIndeed, the sprint to add more buildings to the Magic City\u2019s skyline has turned into a jog, according to an analysis of city of Miami active permits by\nTRD\n. Data show that general contractors held 1,697 active permits valued at about $3.7 billion from August 2022 through August 2025. Zoomed out over a longer stretch, it\u2019s clear the pace is slowing. Between 2019 and 2024, the same analysis showed that general contractors pulled 87,228 permits in Miami, with a total project cost of\n$14.9 billion\n.\nLast year\u2019s top performing firm, Winchester, Massachusetts-based John Moriarty &amp; Associates, saw its output diminish considerably. In the three-year period between 2022 and 2025, John Moriarty had total project costs of $340.2 million through 65 permits. Between 2019 and 2024, the firm had $1.1 billion in total project costs through 129 permits. As a result, Moriarty dropped to third place in the most recent ranking.\nMiami-based Coastal Construction, with a total of $858 million in project costs and 48 active permits between 2022 and 2025, clocked in with the highest dollar amount for a general contracting firm in the city. Melo Group grabbed the second spot among most active general contracting firms with a total of $380.5 million in project costs based on 25 active permits.\nMarket conditions and rising costs will make it tougher for projects that have not broken ground, according to Melo. \u201cYou are still seeing a lot of cranes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut next year, it\u2019s going back to a normal pace of construction.\u201d\nMelo\u2019s sentiment is shared by other construction industry experts. Uncertainty and volatility created by the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs and immigration crackdown is causing friction between developers, contractors and subcontractors over how much price increases can be blamed on the White House\u2019s agenda.\nPassing the buck\nTariffs on imported materials have become a persistent issue reshaping construction costs and contracts in Miami and nationally. Recent U.S. trade policies have significantly increased the cost of critical construction materials.\nSteel and aluminum imports saw tariffs jump from 25 percent to 50 percent this year, with additional baseline tariffs applied broadly across other imported goods. Experts estimate material import tariffs affecting construction have surged to an effective rate near 28 percent, potentially rising higher depending on trade negotiations and retaliatory tariffs.\nYet, general contractors and subcontractors are not seeing eye-to-eye on the root cause of the price increases, noted Tom C. Murphy, Coastal Construction\u2019s co-president.\n\u201cI think we are at the end of the cycle for projects that began shortly after the pandemic.\u201d\nmartin melo, melo group\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen an increase in materials and pricing from subcontractors,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much of it is related to tariffs. The potential or idea that there could be some market volatility will make people a little bit more aggressive in their fee structure.\u201d\nCoastal\u2019s projects include St. Regis Brickell, a 50-story condominium with 152 units; a 70-story mixed-use high-rise with a combined 789 condos and apartments at Miami Worldcenter by Nafali Group; and 2600 Biscayne, another mixed-use tower with multifamily and retail by Oak Row Equities in Edgewater.\nMelo told\nTRD\nthat his firm has seen cost jumps for a small segment of construction materials, like the price of faucets and elevator parts increasing by 10 percent to 20 percent. Yet, the cost of concrete has remained stable, he said.\n\nDisagreements over tariffs are also influencing negotiations between general contractors and developers, said Elizabeth \u201cLiz\u201d Coppolecchia, a construction lawyer and partner at Coral Gables-based law firm Weiss Serota.\n\u201cContractors want protection in contracts against unexpected tariff increases, while developers seek to limit their liability after signing agreements,\u201d Coppolecchia said. \u201cTariff provisions have become standard negotiation points in contracts here.\u201d\nLabored labor\nMiami\u2019s labor market within the construction sector remains under pressure from several factors, including ongoing immigration enforcement actions. Earlier this year, federal immigration raids and crackdowns created uncertainty for many contractors, especially in markets in Florida that rely on immigrant workers.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to take a political stance on this, but immigration has obviously affected this to some extent,\u201d Coppolecchia said, noting the construction labor pool has been in decline since before the second Trump administration.\n\u201cThis has been kind of progressing since the Covid days,\u201d she said. \u201cContractors are having a harder time getting the amount of manpower that they need for these massive developments.\u201d\nStill, Murphy and Melo said they have not dealt with any firsthand labor disruptions with their projects.\n\u201cWe were blessed not to have experienced anything of any real significance,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cReally, we heard about what was happening through word of mouth. It\u2019s really tough to pinpoint what the impact has been where some of the actual raids have occurred.\u201d\nMelo echoed Murphy\u2019s assessment: \u201cI can\u2019t speak for subcontractors, but we haven\u2019t felt any impact.\u201d\nRisk assessment\nAs the next development cycle begins, general contractors are concerned about a glut of projects that may not get shovels in the dirt.\n\u201cI think contractors would probably worry that developers are biting off more than they can chew,\u201d Coppolecchia said. \u201cI think developers are pushing for schedules that are a little tough to meet and may not necessarily reap the benefits that they\u2019re expecting.\u201d\nMiami\u2019s boom has also created a pool of new players thinking they can easily get into the development game and make money, added Coastal\u2019s Murphy.\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about the influx of unsophisticated and inexperienced teams and individuals that want to get into the real estate industry,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThey overpay for a property, start to develop plans only to find out that the project doesn\u2019t make real sense. You wind up with a hyper-market where everyone raises their prices, and then the bottom falls out.\u201d\nAccess the comprehensive data set supporting this ranking\nhere\n.\nTRD Data\np\nuts the power of real data in your hands.",

        "content": "It\u2019s hard to say when exactly fortunes turned, but real estate players agree: Much of Miami-Dade County is in a buyer\u2019s market.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a buyer\u2019s market up to $2 million, $3 million bucks,\u201d Duff Rubin, Coldwell Banker\u2019s regional president for the Southeast, said. \u201cYou see a lot of stale inventory, and there\u2019s a lot of overpriced listings.\u201d\nBut above $3 million, and even more categorically above $10 million, the situation is different.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a story of contrasts,\u201d Corcoran Group\u2019s Pam Liebman said. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing a very, very strong uber-luxury market in Miami. Then you see other parts of the market where sales volume dropped by 40 percent.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a tale of two markets in a year marked by economic uncertainty and international conflict. South Florida faces high insurance costs, diminishing affordability and an\naging condo\ncrisis brought on by post-Surfside regulation.\nFor years, Miami\u2019s real estate brokers insisted that the Magic City was impervious to the obstacles kneecapping the national housing market. While the rest of the country\u2019s residential markets faltered, Miami persevered, racking up record sales and attracting billionaire transplants. A waterfront estate in Bay Point sold for\na record $85.2 million\nin November. Spec developer Todd Glaser and his partners dropped\n$105 million\non a waterfront North Bay Road estate they plan to flip for $169 million. They have a more ambitious plan they\u2019re also working on: Build a spec mansion they would sell for $300 million.\nThe luxury market\u2019s consistent growth means dollar volume is rising even as sales slow.\nThe top 20 brokerages in Miami-Dade County closed nearly $19 billion in on-market sales in the 12-month period ending in August, according to The Real Deal\u2019s analysis. The top 25 agent teams sold about $6.4 billion in on-market sales in that time, up from $5.4 billion in\nlast year\u2019s ranking\n.\nResi\u2019s kingmakers\nThe tops of the rankings for both firms and agents is crowded with familiar faces. Compass nabbed the top spot for brokerages with $3.7 billion in sales. Douglas Elliman, Coldwell Banker, One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty and Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM (BHHS EWM) Realty followed in second, third, fourth and fifth place, respectively.\nThe Jills Zeder Group, which includes Jill Eber, Jill Hertzberg and Judy Zeder at Coldwell Banker, once again clinched first place with nearly $1.4 billion in sales. Chad Carroll\u2019s Carroll Group with Compass placed second with $544.9 million. Elliman\u2019s\nDina Goldentayer\ntook third with $460.2 million in sales. Dora Puig, broker and owner of Luxe Living Realty landed in fourth place, closing $362.4 million. Nelson Gonzalez, of BHHS EWM, rocketed up to fifth with $347.8 million in sales, after falling off the ranking last year.\nThe Brokerage South Florida Real Estate\u2019s Joel Lusky is among the few, like Jordan Karp and the late\nDarin Tansey\n, who have joined the ranks of top agents in Miami-Dade in recent years. Lusky\u2019s top two deals over the past year include the record $20.7 million sale of a waterfront mansion in North Miami in August and the $23 million sale of a waterfront home in Bal Harbour a year earlier. Both were just outside of\nTRD\n\u2019s research parameters.\n\u201cNow buyers are more conscious of who they hire, their credentials. There\u2019s more loyalty.\u201d\nChad Carroll, Compass\nLusky said his strategy is to play nice with the competition.\n\u201cI have excellent relationships with every top agent in the business. That definitely has helped a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a relationship business, not only with clients, but with agents as well.\u201d\nTansey, a longtime Elliman agent who died this summer, made\nTRD\n\u2019s ranking for the first time due to his success at the Ritz-Carlton Residences, Miami Beach, where he lived. Lynna Weil, his executive assistant who is taking over much of Tansey\u2019s business, pointed to a burst of activity this summer at the Ritz.\nNoticeably absent from the list is\nOren Alexander\n, who led the Side-backed brokerage\nOfficial\nand placed eighth last year with $185 million in sales. Alexander, along with his brothers Tal and Alon, is in jail on federal sex trafficking charges and is set to face trial starting in January. He recently\ntapped the \u201cdream team\u201d\nof attorneys who represented Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs in his sex trafficking case.\nOren\u2019s exit from the market has created some opportunities for competitors to pick up his business, some said.\nIndustry shakeups\nShifts in market performance and the agent food chain were not the only elements resi players had to navigate.\nAgents and brokerages also had to adapt to the changes brought by the class action litigation that culminated in the National Association of Realtors reaching a $418 million settlement last year.\nUnder the agreement, buy-side agents are now required to sign buyer-broker agreements with their clients, a mandate some resisted. Many say it can stunt the client relationship by forcing an awkward conversation about compensation.\n\u201cI do see a lot of agents fighting for additional commission when it\u2019s not being offered, and trying to get it from the seller,\u201d said Compass\u2019 top agent, Chad Carroll.\nBut\nbuyer-broker agreements\nended up benefiting his business, he said. \u201cNow buyers are more conscious of who they hire, their credentials. There\u2019s more loyalty.\u201d\nGeorge CancioBello, the owner of Lifestyle International Realty, said the new rules have been a positive for the industry.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a great thing for the industry because now there\u2019s more transparency,\u201d he said. \u201cIt brought more professionalism to the business.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not all easy. Compass agent Nancy Batchelor said the NAR changes make it difficult to \u201cjust spontaneously run and show your listing.\u201d Some sellers are also unwilling to pay a standard commission.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen more discounts on the buyer\u2019s side,\u201d she said. Batchelor referred to a deal in South Miami where her buyers really wanted the property and the seller was paying a much lower fee. \u201cWe had to eat that and it was a very difficult sale.\u201d\nOwnership is also shifting the business. Zillow and Compass have been waging a battle over private listings. In September, Compass announced plans to acquire Anywhere Real Estate for $1.6 billion. The merger is set to close next year and will bring five of Miami-Dade County\u2019s top brokerages under the Compass umbrella. This includes Compass\u2019 fiercest rival in Miami-Dade, Coldwell Banker.\nIt may demand a shift in brokerage strategy from leaders who were more focused on treading water in a challenging market, even if they knew that growth was the path to profitability for traditional brokerages.\n\u201cWe are not of the mindset that larger is better,\u201d Elliman\u2019s Florida CEO Jay Parker said in an interview not long before the announcement. \u201cWe continue to make our primary focus our agent retention and agent success.\u201d\nBut this gargantuan merger may signal that growth is now truly necessary to compete, appraiser Jonathan Miller noted in his weekly newsletter, Housing Notes.\n\u201cThis merger provides a stern warning to all the boutique brokerage firms that they need to align with a large firm to keep up with Compass in terms of offerings to new agents,\u201d he wrote.\nTrump slump\nIn the weeks after Donald Trump\u2019s November presidential victory, exuberant buyers rushed to snap up homes in luxury enclaves in what was dubbed \u201cthe Trump bump.\u201d\nIn Miami Beach, there were 12 closings of $10 million or more in December 2024 and January 2025, compared to just one during those months a year earlier. Dollar volume followed suit, totaling $220 million, compared to just $16.5 million a year earlier, according to data compiled by Miller.\n\u201cMomentum at the end of \u201924 was really good,\u201d Liebman remembered. But market confidence wobbled in the weeks after Trump took office, and it nosedived in April when the president announced his tariff policy on \u201cLiberation Day.\u201d\nSpring, typically a busy time for real estate agents, was quiet.\n\u201cLiberation Day and trade wars aren\u2019t what we had on our bingo card,\u201d said Nathan Zeder, part of Coldwell Banker\u2019s Jills Zeder Group.\nAs markets shook off the shock of tariff policies over the summer, buyer confidence rebounded.\nCorcoran\u2019s top agent, Julian Johnston, said that he and his team were busy from December to February, but work quieted down in March and April. By the end of June, \u201cI was slammed,\u201d he said.\nWaterfront land in Miami Beach became more in demand, as inventory of turnkey homes remained low.\n\u201cThere are trophy properties still being bought by billionaires,\u201d Johnston said.\nGoldentayer said she sold $160 million worth of homes in a 40-day period this summer.\n\u201cI sold a house that was just a concrete shell for $70 million,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the location and view are perfect, buyers are willing to do the work.\u201d\nOne Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agent Michael Martinez was among the agents who said uncertainty surrounding the transition of power, tariffs and other issues pushed a lot of sales activity to the summer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been the most active summer since 2020,\u201d Martinez said.\nMartinez said buyers continue to hail from the Northeast, West Coast and\nLatin America\n. Inventory is on the rise in his markets, and, as expected, \u201cthe houses that need more updating are the ones with higher days on market,\u201d Martinez said.\nMost top agents are looking ahead to New York City\u2019s mayoral election in November, banking on more wealthy New Yorkers relocating to South Florida in the likely event that\nZohran Mamdani wins\n. It\u2019s part of what they think will help fuel the winter season.\n\u201cWe always get an influx of New Yorkers, but the conversation with New Yorkers is especially high-tuned [right now],\u201d said Nathan Zeder.\nA good season could send a wider signal about the market.\n\u201cDevelopers are back in the game. I am starting to see more international clients,\u201d Puig noted. And now that Trump\u2019s been in office for about 10 months, \u201cpeople know what to expect in the next three years. Big money comes out to play.\u201d\nAccess data and contact information from the brokerage ranking\nhere\nand the broker ranking\nhere\n.\nTRD Data\np\nuts the power of real data in your hands.",

        "content": "Robert Rivani, a commercial real estate maverick who bolted Los Angeles for Miami, recently arranged his latest coup: Playboy is moving its Hollywood headquarters to The Rivani, his newly rebranded, seven-story mixed-use project in Miami Beach.\nRivani started out as a sneakerhead and sold his collection for $150,000 as a teen. Even today, he\u2019s unconventional, sporting a gelled mohawk and chest-length beard while doing deals like a Wall Street rainmaker.\nHis approach: Don\u2019t wait for opportunity. Rivani\u2019s habit of outbidding rivals and closing fast has upended Miami\u2019s luxury hospitality sector including its restaurant scene, where he has landed trophy tenants like Delilah, Gekko, Catch and RosaNegra Miami in recent years. Now, the $40 million makeover of his building at\n1691 Washington Avenue\nwill host Playboy\u2019s 250-employee operation in a sprawling penthouse suite, courtesy of a 10-year lease and a promise to revive the faded luster of an iconic brand \u2014 so long as the company\ngets an $800,000 city incentive\nfor its headquarters relocation. The renovation is slated to finish in April 2026.\nThe Real Deal\nsat down\nwith Rivani\nat his Miami home to talk about changing his firm\u2019s name from Black Lion to Rivani, his latest projects, his outspoken persona on social media and in real life, becoming a father and why he is so bullish about Miami hospitality.\nThe interviews have been condensed and edited for clarity.\nBorn\n: April 3, 1990\nHometown\n: Los Angeles\nLives\n: Morningside, Miami\nFamily\n: Wife Krystal and son Ragna\nHow did you land Playboy as the penthouse tenant for The Rivani office project in Miami Beach?\nThey were looking at sites all over South Florida, especially in Miami Beach. When they saw the vision, hospitality and amenities that are coming with our building, it was just a perfect, harmonious match.\nYou\u2019ve coined the term Class X to describe The Rivani. What does that mean?\nI would never let anybody [describe]\nan office building\nof this caliber being Class A. So it\u2019s called Class X.\nWhat are some of the interior details that would give people a sense of why you\u2019re spending $100 million to renovate this building?\nWell, it\u2019s $100 million total [including the $63 million purchase price]. We\u2019re spending about $40 million in improvements. For example, valet for me is really important. We\u2019re the only office building in Miami Beach with a [covered driveway]. We\u2019re spending $5 million just on that. Our reception desks are almost $100,000 each because they are literally carved out of a mountain. And we have a speakeasy lounge where every VIP gets their own liquor cabinet. You can call ahead, \u201cPlease have my bottle of Scotch and four glasses ready for me and my clients.\u201d [Landlords will spend] $125 a square foot for average Class A office space. We\u2019re spending almost $300 a square foot.\n\u201cI\u2019m completely and utterly micromanaging.\u201d\nSo does that mean you\u2019re going to charge Class X office rents?\nI will have to break some records.\nAre you micromanaging or delegating the build-out?\nI\u2019m completely and utterly micromanaging. I\u2019m involved in every detail down to the carpet finishes, the handles of the kitchen cabinets, the toilets and the faucets.\nDoes The Rivani currently have tenants besides Playboy?\nWe are 85 percent occupied. For example, we already have a pretty robust tenant pool including Apple, Morgan Stanley, Raymond James, Williams Sonoma, Coldwell Banker, The Jills and The Peebles Corporation. We don\u2019t just want to let in anybody who wants to lease space. It\u2019s important to curate the right crowd.\nWhy did you decide to do this type of project in Miami Beach?\nI love Miami Beach. It\u2019s had a rough patch the past couple of years. But with the influx of wealth and all the high-net-worth individuals that are choosing to live on Venetian Island, Star Island, Palm Island and North Bay Road, an office building right there is overly convenient for those high-net-worth individuals, which is more of our target market.\nIn the last year or so, you\u2019ve sold a large chunk of your\nrestaurant space\nportfolio. How come?\nI don\u2019t raise money. I don\u2019t have outside investors. Any time I buy and sell a deal, it\u2019s my own money, so I need the capital in order to move on to the next project.\nWhy don\u2019t you like having business partners?\nI\u2019m a very unique character when it comes to my concepts and my ideas. I\u2019m sure you, just like everybody else, thought I was an absolute psychopath buying every single ground-floor vacant retail space that nobody can do anything with. And I have these weird, quirky ideas that I think will come to fruition, and I\u2019ve blown my own money to bet on it.\nIn 2023, you sold \u201cRivani Castle,\u201d your Los Angeles estate inspired by \u201cHarry Potter\u201dand \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d including a replica of the Iron Throne, for $20 million. What happened to the contents of the house?\nThe \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d stuff is coming to my office headquarters. The throne is going to be front and center.\nDo you have any plans to create a new castle in Miami?\nI wish that land wasn\u2019t so goddamn expensive. We had 2.5 acres in L.A. and it was a 15,000-square-foot home. It\u2019s almost impossible to replicate that in Miami.\nYou have a big social media presence, and you talk to the media. Why do you feel comfortable being front and center?\nIt\u2019s important for people to understand the vision, creativity and hard work of what you\u2019re doing. I want people to see that I want to help the businesses that we sign up. I want to help promote Playboy and all these new restaurants that open up in the city. And I like to speak my mind. I think a lot of people in real estate are scared to have their voice because they\u2019re getting money from outside investors. As soon as they do something that an outside investor doesn\u2019t want, they\u2019re going to slap their wrist or pull their investment or do something to control them.\nBut is social media engagement a strategy for you?\nFor sure. Instead of going on my website like a typical developer, you go to my Instagram and look at all the things I\u2019ve done and what I\u2019m about. People want to follow a person much more than follow a brand. I feel like I\u2019m the guy out of left field. Like, \u201cwho the hell is this guy with the mohawk and the beard?\u201d I was like, \u201cI\u2019m gonna play into that more.\u201d\nWhen did you get the mohawk and beard?\nIt happened during [the pandemic] because I couldn\u2019t get a barber when everything was shut down. My wife asked me if I wanted her to cut my hair. She shaved the sides of my head and I just slicked the top of my hair. Then I just let the beard grow out and ended up looking like the\nBlack Lion\nlogo. At the time, I didn\u2019t have public social media accounts.\nDo you spend a lot of time and money grooming?\nMy wife still cuts my hair from time to time. I use oils [on my beard] every single day. I gel my hair a few times a week. The problem is with gel in Miami is the heat is fucking nuts. You got all the stuff streaking down the sides of your head.\n\nYou and Krystal recently had your first child: a son, Ragna. For how long did you both want kids?\nWe always wanted children since we met, but I made it clear in the beginning [of the relationship] that my first child is my career. Once we moved to Miami, we decided to have fun for a few years and then it was time to have a kid. Our little guy was born eight months ago, and that has completely changed my life.\nI\u2019ve seen pictures of him. He\u2019s got a mohawk. Is he your mini-me?\nYes, he\u2019s mini-me. But he\u2019ll never be in commercial or any type of real estate.\nHow come? Most real estate tycoons set up a line of succession\n.\nBecause of the amount of pain and suffering that I had to go through to get [Ragna] to where he is financially set. He shouldn\u2019t have to work in an industry because I mandate him to do it. One reason my company was called Black Lion is because I was the black sheep of my family. [My parents] wanted me to be a doctor or an attorney, I don\u2019t want to force somebody\u2019s direction in their life.\nHow many siblings do you have, and did they become what your parents wanted?\nI have two siblings. They\u2019re in another world in another place where they follow Mommy\u2019s and Daddy\u2019s footsteps. I decided to get up and get out.\nYou refer to your little family as the Meatballs. How come?\nWe just call [Ragna] a meatball because he\u2019s super chunky.\nWhat\u2019s been your biggest surprise about being a father?\nThe biggest surprise is that all the things I thought were so important really aren\u2019t. We almost lost him during the first two months of his life. It made me realize that any other problem in life is absolutely not [a problem].\nWhere do you get your fashion sense?\nMy wife would say it\u2019s her. I would say that it is a blend of just being myself and wanting to stand out, even though I\u2019m more shy than you can actually imagine.\nHow many custom-made lion T-shirts do you have?\nI think 20, give or take.\nHow many sneakers did you have when you sold the collection for $150,000?\n200-plus. All stacked up everywhere in my house.\nWhat\u2019s the most expensive pair of sneakers that you have today?\nNothing crazy. I\u2019m more into watches now than I am into shoes. Rolex, Roger Dubuis and Hublot. But I am not going to spend half a million dollars to get a Richard Mille watch just because someone says it\u2019s a fashion statement.\nAre you still your wife\u2019s patient zero when it comes out to trying new foods and health and wellness trends?\nFor sure.\nWhat\u2019s a food that you recently tried for the first time?\nPassionfruit. It\u2019s fucking great. I\u2019ve had it in like nasty drinks, but not fresh by itself.\nDo you still make your own sushi?\nOh yeah. We\u2019re opening a sushi concept with Alvaro Perez, the chef behind [Miami restaurant] Ogawa. I will be one of the sushi chefs. It\u2019s a hobby for me.\nWhen did you start making sushi?\nAbout six, seven years ago. I go to Japan every [year]. It\u2019s my favorite place in the world.\nDo you like cooking, preparing meals in general?\nAbsolutely not. Sushi is as far as I\u2019ll go.\nWorking with your wife, how do you guys make it work?\nIt works great. She brings a feminine touch that I don\u2019t have. She\u2019ll do all the little intimate and delicate features that make [a space] really special. She also busts my chops.\nAnother thing you don\u2019t have a problem with is sharing your political views and where you stand on issues. How come?\nWhere do you think I stand on politics?\nWell, I know you\u2019re anti-Gavin Newsom and anti-Karen Bass.\nI\u2019m anti-craziness. I\u2019m not left, and I\u2019m not right. I\u2019m a very down-the-middle guy. If I do have a voice on social media or publicly, and I think that there\u2019s something wrong going on, if I don\u2019t speak up and say something, who\u2019s going to? It\u2019s been proven now that the politics of California and New York have caused this mass migration to Florida. It\u2019s because of their actions. And if those actions spread to Miami, then what\u2019s next? Miami is the last frontier. If Miami goes to shit or South Florida goes to shit, where are we all going to move to?\nHave your political views hurt you professionally?\nFrom a business side of things, I think most people love and appreciate what I\u2019m doing for South Florida. I do get hate mail and crazy direct messages. I\u2019ve talked about Jewish things and protecting Israel. I\u2019ve gotten messages like, \u201cI wish Adolf Hitler finished the job with your family and burned your bodies.\u201d",

        "content": "That\u2019s encouraging,\u201d Amalfi Estates\u2019 Anthony Marguleas murmured as he peered out the window of his coffee beige Porsche to get a look at a school bus on Sunset Boulevard.\nWhat would hardly warrant a second glance elsewhere was cause for optimism given that eight months ago the major thoroughfare\u2014one of only three ways in and out of the Palisades\u2014was gridlocked. Residents sat in traffic as they sought to escape January\u2019s Palisades Fire, with many abandoning vehicles that were later bulldozed to clear the road.\nDriving through the Palisades is different now.\nThe community, which Marguleas estimated saw about 5,900 homes\ndamaged or destroyed\nby the fire, has had debris cleared from most lots as the wood frames of new construction begin to emerge.\nMarguleas, who has run the Palisades-based residential brokerage Amalfi Estates for 31 years, and his wife Sue managed to evacuate unharmed, but their Alphabet Streets home was destroyed like so many others. The PTSD is real, he said.\nIt\u2019s like a moment in time, like Pompeii with the volcano.\u201d\nAnthony Marguleas, Amalfi Estates\nSince January, Marguleas\u2019 attention has crisscrossed\nland listings and sales\n(he\u2019s sold or is in escrow on 28 deals in the past eight-and-a-half months), educating owners and buyers (40 percent of land deals are falling out of escrow due to lack of understanding around financing or construction), consulting with builders, launching the 1Pali community-building group and dispelling misinformation flooding the market.\n\u201cI just want to help the community rebuild,\u201d Marguleas said.\nIt\u2019s a simple sentiment lost in the political tension circling the rebuild and one that leaves Marguleas biting back tears.\n\u201cOur goal is to bring everyone home. It may sound kitschy, but it\u2019s true,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the gist of what we\u2019re doing and why we\u2019re doing it.\u201d\nMarguleas spent a Monday in September with The Real Deal driving through the Palisades for a view from the ground of a community building back.\n1\n0:00 a.m.\nMarguleas pulls up to\n1186 Corsica Drive\nin the Riviera neighborhood.\nIt\u2019s the former home of late actor and comedian Dom DeLuise, which hit the market in August with a $21 million ask. About 150 people came through the broker caravan and the first Sunday of the open house.\n\u201cOpen houses as we know it are almost non-existent in the fire area,\u201d Marguleas said, but noting some exceptions such as the Riviera and Huntington neighborhoods. \u201cOpen houses are when we typically see other agents. That\u2019s when you find out about new listings. That\u2019s when you get to network with your sphere. And we lost that ability. Our job has changed quite a bit from selling houses to being a community leader.\u201d\n1\n1:21 a.m.\nAfter an extensive chat on the state of the residential real estate market, Marguleas heads onto Sunset Boulevard for the Alphabet Streets: \u201cWe also call it ground zero.\u201d\nIt was one of the hardest hit areas. Today, most lots are cleared and signs on some tout Thomas James Homes, Ram Miller Construction and residential brokerages.\nSeveral builders are now renting vacant parcels to store their equipment and Marguleas has helped broker a few of those deals.\n1\n1:50 a.m.\nMarguleas passes his home, which is blocked from street view by a wrap.\n\u201cThis is my lot here on the right. We just got building permit approval, so we\u2019re going to be starting construction. This one\u2019s closing escrow tomorrow. It\u2019s my neighbor\u2019s. You still see the Christmas lights. It\u2019s just weird. We\u2019re in September. It\u2019s like a moment in time, like Pompeii with the volcano.\u201d\n1\n1:51 a.m.\nJust a few seconds away, he stops at 915 Kagawa Street.\n\u201cThat\u2019s Thomas James. That\u2019s the model home. That\u2019s going to be the first home developed and they\u2019ll finish it by Thanksgiving. See how many homes are going up here? Every week, it\u2019s more and more.\u201d\nHe parks along the curb and walks in through the home\u2019s garage, talking to the site supervisor and taking a tour.\n\n1\n2:03 p.m.\nMarguleas continues his drive through the Alphabet Streets, which are named after Methodist ministers and laid out in a grid alphabetically.\n\u201cThere were wealthy people here, but the Palisades was also made up of a lot of retirees. Twenty-five percent of the Palisades locals are over 65. They bought their homes 30, 40 years ago for dirt cheap and it just happened to appreciate a lot. There were retired teachers and nurses. It wasn\u2019t like Bel-Air or Beverly Hills. People were very down to earth. In the Palisades, there\u2019s a great shirt that people would wear that said, \u2018If you\u2019re rich, you live in Beverly Hills. If you\u2019re famous, you live in Malibu. If you\u2019re lucky, you live in Pacific Palisades.\u2019\u201d\n12:04 p.m.\nThe Alphabet\u2019s Embury Street is adjacent to developer\nRick Caruso\u2019s\nPalisades Village\nshopping center. Barricades around the perimeter block public access as Marguleas drives past.\n\u201cRick Caruso has been fantastic at merging the public and the private partnerships. He started [non-profit] Steadfast LA as a way to do that.\u201d\nMarguleas pointed to Archistar as an example. He credited Caruso with pushing for the artificial intelligence-based software at the local and state level to help with expediting permitting times.\n1\n2:06 p.m.\nLunch at Palisades Garden Caf\u00e9 is a burger and Coke as Marguleas chats with Kevin Niles from the American Legion Post 283\u2019s executive committee. They catch up on recent openings, including CVS on Aug. 25.\nDuring lunch is when Marguleas opens up about\nMeasure ULA\nand its implications for the Palisades.\n\u201cWhoever marketed that was brilliant. They called it a mansion tax. Half the people affected were commercial, these big buildings in Downtown L.A. It was a $5 million lot in the Palisades. That\u2019s not a mansion.\u201d\nThere\u2019s also the day-to-day reality of businesses reopening, but not enough residents to serve: \u201cThat\u2019s the chicken and egg: They open a restaurant and there\u2019s not enough people living here or workers.\u201d\n1\n2:56 p.m.\nBack in the car, he motions to a stretch of Sunset Boulevard between Pacific Coast Highway and Temescal Canyon Road that\u2019s become part of the density debate.\n\u201cThe concern is multifamily; it\u2019s not the single-family. If you own a house in the Alphabet Streets and you find out the person next door to you is building four units, and the person on the other side is building four units, you\u2019re going to be in an uproar. But if you find out someone on Sunset\u2019s building higher density, \u2018It\u2019s not near me.\u2019\u201d\nCentral to the tussle is Senate Bill 79, which lawmakers passed in September. It\u2019s aimed at encouraging multifamily development near transit stops. As of press time, the bill was awaiting Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s signature.\n1\n:08 p.m.\nMarguleas wants to stop at Temescal Canyon Road, which reopened in August.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been down here since the fires,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s night and day.\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began using the road Feb. 23 to do recycling of concrete and metals from burned properties. Excavators, magnetic claws, conveyer belts and trucks filled the street. Today it\u2019s empty and quiet as a few cars pass.\nFrom there, he swings back through the center of town to get to the Huntington, one of the pricier neighborhoods and relatively untouched by the fires.\nThen it\u2019s a peek at Will Rogers State Park, which is closed to the public temporarily as the state works to restore the property. He passes the polo field, a husk of itself after the fire consumed it along with the historic ranch house and other buildings.\nFor Marguleas, everything is glass half full as he and his wife prepare to return to the Palisades and begin their own rebuild.\n\u201cWe\u2019re planning on moving back in about a month,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to rent a place because we miss the Palisades.\u201d",

        "content": "Beverly Hills Estates co-founder and CEO Rayni Williams was talking about Measure United to House L.A., better known as ULA or the mansion tax, when she paused to check her demeanor.\n\u201cSorry if I\u2019m shouting,\u201d Williams said, a bit sheepishly.\nThe tax has weighed on Williams and others in real estate for more than two years. Aimed at raising funds to prevent homelessness and add more affordable housing to the market, critics say it\u2019s done nothing but cast a pall over dealmaking.\n\u201cULA is the biggest detriment to the market right now. More than interest rates. More than world events,\u201d said Williams, whose Beverly Hills Estates team rose to the No. 1 spot on The Real Deal\u2019s list of L.A. County\u2019s top agents and teams.\n\u201cIt is an additional 5.5 percent [on sales of $10.6 million or more] on top of escrow fees and commissions,\u201d Williams said. The basis of the tax is price, not profit, which she finds especially irksome.\n\u201cYou are paying a tax that has no forbearance. In other words, you could still be losing money on your property. You could be upside down on your property and you are still paying a mansion tax that, by the way, nobody even knows where the money\u2019s going.\u201d\nEven with the headwind, L.A.\u2019s top agents managed to close $9.7 billion in deals.\n\u201cSorry if I\u2019m shouting.\u201d\nBeverly Hills Estates co-founder and CEO Rayni Williams, who got worked up talking about Measure ULA\nThe Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Williams &amp; Williams Estates Group swiped the No. 1 spot from the Aaron Kirman Group on this year\u2019s\nranking of the top 25 agents and teams\nin Los Angeles County. The team made the jump from second place last year by closing almost $1.3 billion in sales volume across 197 transactions.\nTRD analyzed the buy and sell sides of properties in the Multiple Listing Service between July 1, 2024, and July 1, 2025, for this year\u2019s\nranking\n. The list does not count deals of less than $1 million or off-market transactions, the latter of which would considerably alter the ranking\u2019s makeup.\nWilliams &amp; Williams enjoys a comfortable margin that sets it apart from No. 2\u2019s Aaron Kirman Group, which had about $891 million in volume across 221 transactions. Carolwood Estates\u2019 Bond Street Partners jumped up five spaces to No. 3 with 64 deals tallying to $635.8 million. Bond Street founders David Parnes and James Harris\nannounced their split\nas business partners in September, although both remain at the brokerage.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s The Altman Brothers Team stayed put at No. 4, closing on nearly $591.7 million in volume across 88 deals. Meanwhile,\nWestside Estate Agency\u2019s\nKurt Rappaport closed out the top five with 19 deals for the July-to-July period, coming out to about $568 million or nearly $30 million per transaction.\nMarket paralysis\nSome agents say they could have closed on more were it not for Measure ULA.\nThe Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Jack Harris and Michael Fahimian, who entered the list for the first time at No. 20, can attest to that.\n\nThe duo had been working on a recent deal for nearly two months, but it ultimately fell apart. They ended up renting the home instead of selling it.\n\u201cThe seller was not netting enough due to the 4 percent ULA tax, and we couldn\u2019t bridge the gap between the buyer and seller,\u201d Harris said. \u201c[The seller] would have lost money due to that 4 percent.\u201d\nHarris and Fahimian sold 18 homes in the ranking research period, which penciled out to $200.8 million.\nVoters passed Measure ULA, which applies only to property transactions within the city of Los Angeles, in November 2022. The thresholds change annually, with the current tax set at 4 percent for transactions of $5.3 million and 5.5 percent for those $10.6 million or more.\nCritics say that Measure ULA lacks guardrails and exclusions, akin to carveouts with the capital gains tax, that take specifics into account, like speculative developments selling at a loss or properties in the Pacific Palisades affected by the wildfires earlier this year. Instead, some in the industry argue Measure ULA punishes properties that sit on expensive dirt but are far from mansions.\nCarolwood\u2019s Linda May reported that in the over-$10 million range, the gap created by the tax crumbled her ability to close. May, who has one of the highest average prices per transaction on this year\u2019s ranking at $20.6 million per deal, rose two slots to No. 19 with 10 trades totaling $205.6 million.\n\u201cIn one case, both sides agreed on price, but once the tax was factored in, the seller wasn\u2019t willing to absorb it, and the buyer wasn\u2019t willing to increase their number,\u201d she said. \u201cIn others, negotiations dragged out much longer as both parties tried to rework terms around the tax.\u201d\nLast step\nIf acceptance is the final stage in the grieving process, parts of the market have arrived at that point in varying gradations.\n\u201cBuyers have factored it into their offers, but sellers are still struggling to accept the hit to their net,\u201d May said. \u201cUnless someone has a real reason to sell, many are holding off, which keeps inventory tight and the market stagnant.\u201d\nThere have been several starts and stops on attempts to modify or strike down the tax.\n\u201cThere were all these glimmers of hope that maybe it was going to go away, but now I feel like generally people accept and acknowledge that it\u2019s there,\u201d David Berg of Compass\u2019 Smith &amp; Berg Partners team said. The team counted 90 deals totaling $454.9 million in volume during the ranking period to sit at No. 8.\nLawsuits came hot and heavy after the tax\u2019s passage, with the most notable one lobbed by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association in December 2022.\nThe group, along with the California Business Roundtable, sponsored the Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Act, which was removed from the November 2024 ballot after a California Supreme Court ruling dubbed it an all-out revision to the state constitution. It was a broad-based initiative that included invalidating Measure ULA.\nFor the real estate industry, the latest bright spot was\nSenate Bill 423\n, which carved out for apartment and other commercial buildings built in the past 15 years a transfer tax of no more than 1.5 percent within the city of L.A. Single-family homes built within the past five years on property destroyed by a disaster deemed a local emergency would have also seen a similar reduced transfer tax. However, that bill was pulled in September.\nAccess data and contact information from this ranking\nher\ne\n.\nTRD Data\np\nuts the power of real data in your hands.",

Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group has been tapped to lead sales, which are expected to launch next year.\nLocated from Chelsea Piers and overlooking the West Side Highway, Sigoura in a statement called the site \u201cthe last major waterfront development site in West Chelsea of this scale and quality.\u201d\nUri Chaitchik\u2019s Casco Development bought the plot in 2014 for just $5 million than Sigoura paid. Chaitchik had planned a 20-story condo project with a $539 million sellout price, but had to seek Chapter 11 protection after financing failed to materialize.\n\nSigoura purchased the land with a $56 million loan from Deutsche Bank.\nThe construction loan comes at a fortuitous time.\nDemand for downtown properties\non the city\u2019s west side has been fierce, and there\u2019s a scarcity of new condos filling the need. Witkoff Group and Access Industries\u2019 One High Line, which occupies a similar spot along the highway just a few blocks south, has been one of the\nbest-selling condo projects in the last year\n, passing $1 billion in sales at the end of 2024.\nMeanwhile there are\nno downtown condo projects over 100 units\nexpected to launch sales next year, according to data from Corcoran Sunshine. Atlas Capital and Zeckendorf Development\u2019s 80 Clarkson, which has 112 units and also sits right off the West Side Highway further south, launched sale this past spring but has yet to publicly report any contracts.\nSigoura has been wheeling and dealing elsewhere in Manhattan in recent years. Legion and its partner, Gindi Capital, in February closed on the\nfinal two properties in a six-parcel assemblage\non Third Avenue and East 21st Street, where they\u2019re planning a 20-story condo project, the largest development on Gramercy Park in a century.\nLast year, the Legion and EJS Development bought a Greenwich Village development site at 5 West 13th Street for $57.5 million. Legion also scored a $195 million construction loan from Deutsche Bank and JVP Management for its 26-unit luxury condo building at 1122 Madison Avenue, which began vertical construction this summer.\n",

        "content": "The Chicago Bears\u2019 vision for a $5 billion stadium-anchored campus in Arlington Heights could deliver a revenue windfall for the northwest suburb \u2014 but only if the math holds up.\nTwo economic impact studies released Tuesday show the NFL team\u2019s proposed mixed-use redevelopment at the former Arlington International Racecourse would generate at least $15 million annually for village coffers, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The development, slated for more than 1,100 residential units, a hotel, office space and retail, could yield $510 million in tax revenue for the village over four decades.\nBut officials in Arlington Heights cautioned that the rosy revenue picture doesn\u2019t yet account for the steep price of public infrastructure upgrades \u2014 as much as $855 million \u2014 needed to support the project.\nThe reports, prepared by Bears consultant HR&amp;A Advisors and vetted by the village\u2019s own adviser Hunden Strategic Partners, highlight expected gains from sales, amusement, hotel and food and beverage taxes. The Bears\u2019 analysis goes further, projecting $18 million a year for the village, $38 million for the state and $12 million for Cook County, plus 9,000 jobs across Illinois. Neighboring suburbs such as Rolling Meadows are already\nprimed\nto cash in on redevelopment projects to siphon off some of the economic activity should the project go forward.\nEven so, local leaders stressed that the project won\u2019t move forward without a net fiscal benefit. Arlington Heights Mayor Jim Tinaglia said in a statement that the findings show great potential, while noting ongoing studies of traffic, transportation and municipal service costs.\n\nAt the statehouse, the numbers haven\u2019t yet swayed\nlawmakers\n. House Speaker Emanuel \u201cChris\u201d Welch told a crowd in Arlington Heights Tuesday he\u2019s unsure whether a pending megaproject bill \u2014 legislation that would let developers negotiate decades-long property tax deals with local authorities \u2014 has the votes to pass, the Daily Herald\nreported\n. The measure, backed by the Bears and organized labor, doesn\u2019t mention the team but would clear the path for its proposed tax break.\nDemocrats hold a supermajority in the House, but Welch said he won\u2019t bring the bill to the floor without clear support, especially from Chicago\u2019s 26 legislators. Gov. J.B. Pritzker has signaled openness to the megaproject concept but reiterated the team must first pay off $534 million still owed for\nSoldier Field\u2019s 2003 renovation\n.\nThe Bears, who earlier this month said they are committed to pursuing the Arlington Heights site over a competing South Loop option, are\nbetting\ntheir stadium could deliver Super Bowls and other mega-events \u2014 the type of splash that suburban officials may welcome but that Chicago power brokers are reluctant to subsidize.\nThe question for Arlington Heights is whether the promise of increased revenue and regional prestige outweighs the risks of footing the bill for the infrastructure needed to make it work. In a statement on the village\u2019s website, officials made clear they will not approve the project \u201cunless there is a net fiscal benefit \u2014 meaning the village\u2019s new revenues must exceed new expenses.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "In Doral, the vacancy rate is up to 6.5 percent, and rents have hit a three-year low.\nYes,\nthe Miami market is cooling\n, but Doral is facing more than just a slowdown. About 40 percent of\nDoral\u2019s\n80,000 residents were born in Venezuela or have Venezuelan heritage, and these families are fleeing President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, the\nWall Street Journal\nreports.\nIn some Doral buildings, vacancy rates are reaching 10 percent or more as residents contend with uncertain immigration status, according to the Journal. Many Venezuelans are living in the U.S. with temporary legal status, the result of programs like humanitarian parole and Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which were expanded under the Biden administration.\nSince taking office in January, the\nTrump\nadministration has sought to revoke these permissions, launching a bevy of legal actions in recent months and leaving more than 1 million people in immigration status limbo.\nLeasing agents have a close-up view of how this uncertainty is playing out in Doral.\n\u201cThey\u2019re all telling me, \u2018No, I can\u2019t stay, my [temporary status] is expiring,\u201d Maria Eugenia Nucete, a Venezuelan-American broker, told the publication. She has worked in Doral for decades. In March, she lost a Venezuelan client who relocated to Italy.\nChristi Fraga, the mayor of Doral, said she\u2019s seen the exodus as well.\n\n\u201cI do personally know of some families that have self-deported. Their status was unsure and they didn\u2019t want to be here illegally,\u201d she told the Journal. \u201cI\u2019m sure it will affect the housing market to a certain extent.\u201d\nSelf-deporting residents often have plans to move to Spain or Italy, or return to Venezuela, according to the Journal. Gabriela Hernandez, a 26-year-old Venezuelan who has lived in the U.S. for nearly a decade, has been living with her boyfriend in a one-bedroom apartment. Her boyfriend, fearing the loss of his protected status, has already left Doral, and she has plans to depart in the coming weeks.\n\u201cAll of our plans here have collapsed,\u201d she told the publication. They plan to emigrate to Spain.\nFlighty tenants represent a new risk to building owners. Doral landlords now say they want to know immigration status before renting, and some are turning away potential tenants with temporary status, unwilling to face a rent delinquency if a court ruling strips their legal residency. But lawyers say these denials could amount to a violation of the Fair Housing Act.\n\u201cIt could be viewed as a race-discrimination case or it could be viewed as a case involving allegations of discrimination based upon national origin,\u201d Miami-based attorney Courtney Cunningham told the Journal.\nWhile Doral now faces a contracting rental market, it has attracted millions of dollars in investment in recent years, including from the Trump family. In January, the Doral City Council greenlit the Trump Organization\u2019s plan to develop up to\n1,500 luxury condos\non the Trump National Doral Miami property.\n\u2013\u2013\nKate Hinsche",

        "content": "It pays to be on the water.\nOr so it goes in Brooklyn, which in the third quarter hit a record price per square foot of $1,490 for closed sponsor sales, according to data by Brown Harris Stevens Development Marketing.\nDriving the price climb are two dueling waterfront projects that launched sales within five months of each other last year,\nNaftali Group\u2019s Williamsburg Wharf\nand\nTwo Trees\u2019 One Domino Square\n.\nIn the last 12 months, they have been the two top-selling developments in the city, according to Marketproof, combining for over 110 contracts. Both buildings have an average closed price per square foot of over $2,000, making for the kind of large-scale, ultra-luxury cocktail that can push prices up throughout the borough.\nThe developments in Brooklyn have been \u201ccoming into their age of luxury,\u201d according to BHSDM\u2019s Jason Thomas, citing One Domino Square and Williamsburg Wharf as projects with \u201clarger-scale, higher-end finishes, [and] bigger amenities.\u201d\nIn total, Brooklyn notched 247 new development contracts in the third quarter, roughly flat with the borough\u2019s 10-year average. The contract dollar volume of $435 million was 18 percent above the 10-year average.\nOne Domino Square, where an in-house team led by Aaron Goed is running sales, topped the borough with 18 contracts last quarter.\n\nManhattan has\nnot had the same ultra-desirable large projects\nlaunch that can juice contract numbers, even with buyer demand.\n\u201cWhen supply becomes constrained and people can\u2019t get what they want \u2026 a lot of times they just go to the sidelines and they just say, \u2018I\u2019ll wait it out,\u2019 Thomas said.\nAt the end of the third quarter, Manhattan counted just under 4,000 new development condos available to purchase, leaving it roughly 25 percent under its 10-year supply average, according to data from BHSDM.\nFacing slim pickings, buyers signed just an estimated 298 new development contracts last quarter, down 15 percent from the 10-year average. The contract counts adjust for the 650,000-square-foot elephant in the borough, 80 Clarkson, which has yet to report a contract, and for 125 Greenwich, which batch-reported 20 contracts in the third quarter.\nManhattan\u2019s top-selling building last quarter was Magnum Real Estate Group\u2019s La Maison Collette at 815 Broadway in Greenwich Village, which netted 18 contracts since launching sales in July. A Serhant New Development team led by Andrew Appell, David Fernandez and Irina Balueva are leading sales.\nDespite the borough\u2019s constrained supply, the average closed price per square foot was relatively flat at $2,095.\nThere are no quick fixes on the horizon for Manhattan. A levelling off of land prices will help, according to BHSDM president Stephen Kliegerman. But, \u201cwe don\u2019t see the supply situation turning around basically until the next decade,\u201d he said.\n",

FDNY drones surveyed the damage, while two NYPD K-9s combed the wreckage. There were no signs of anyone trapped and by late morning, city officials confirmed there were no fatalities or injuries.\nThe Department of Buildings established a collapse zone around the site and demolition crews are expected to dismantle what\u2019s left of the chimney before restoring utilities. Con Edison cut gas service.\nThe Mitchel Houses already carried a partial stop-work order from June 25, per DOB records. There was also a plumbing/license complaint in June and a stuck elevator complaint last March. The building has six active violations with penalties due of $31,000, according to DOB records.\n\nResidents described the chaos of the evacuation.\n\u201cIt sounded like a bomb,\u201d one man told Eyewitness News. Another said families rushed out barefoot, carrying children into the cold.\nIn a statement, NYCHA said that \u201can investigation is underway to determine the cause of this event and the extent of any damage beyond the reported exterior damage to the chimney.\u201d\nMore than 3,400 people live in the Mitchel Houses, which date back to 1966. Tenants along the F and G lines were temporarily relocated to a nearby community center.\nThe incident adds another safety black eye for NYCHA, which has been frequently chided with tenant complaints and capital repair needs.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

DWS,\u00a0 also known as RREEF America Property Trust, is led by Stefan Hoops.\nIn the larger deal, Redfearn and TPG Angelo Gordon paid $27.8 million for a 182,919-square-foot warehouse at 5255 Northwest 159th Street in\nMiami Gardens\n. The joint venture paid $152 a square foot for the facility.\nDWS sold the 6.9-acre site for more than double the previous sale price seven years ago. In 2018, DWS paid $12.3 million for it, records show. Completed in 1974, the facility\u2019s main tenant is Mac Papers + Packaging.\n\nIn the second transaction, Redfearn and TPG Angelo Gordon paid $8.9 million for a 50,000-square-foot warehouse at 5959 Northwest 35th Avenue near\nHialeah\n. The buyer paid $177 a square foot for the building.\nThe 2-acre property sold for $5 million above the previous sale price. In 2018, DWS paid $3.9 million for it, records show. Completed between 1961 and 1964, the warehouse is leased to C Air Brokers &amp; Forwarders.\nThe Miami-Dade deals mark the latest South Florida industrial collaboration between Redfearn and TPG Angelo Gordon. In August, the joint venture dropped $33.4 million for an industrial complex of four warehouses in Miramar, Vizzda shows.\nMeanwhile, DWS is in wheel-and-deal mode. In February, the firm sold Las Olas Centre I &amp; II, a two-building office complex in Fort Lauderdale, for\n$208 million\n. Chicago-based Bradford Allen Investment Advisors bought the property.\nIn July, DWS\u2019 The Alhambra, a two-building office complex in Coral Gables, hit the market with a target price of\n$125 million\n.

The building rises 16 stories and contains 350,000 square feet of offices.\nThe approximately $200-per-square-foot sale price represents a 57.6 percent drop, or $98.4 million, from the $170.9 million that CBRE Investment Management paid for it in 2018. The seller in that $480-per-square-foot transaction was Blackstone Real Estate Partners.\nCBRE made several investments in the property, adding amenities like an on-site concierge, a fitness center and high-tech meeting spaces. That, combined with a cross-bay view of the San Francisco skyline, made the Powell Street building an attractive asset in the local office market.\nThe building has brought in some notable biotech and health care tenants in recent years.\nIn 2018, cybersecurity company Tanium leased 65,000 square feet in the building to serve as its headquarters; it moved to Seattle two years later, though it still occupies its space in the\nEmeryville building\n.\n\nEmeryville-founded protein bar company Clif Bar, meanwhile, is moving some of its workforce to the building, E\u2019ville Eye\nreported\n. And in 2022, insurance company Canopy Health signed a lease for 13,000 square feet at the building.\nThe building has approximately 103,000 square feet available for lease.\nLBA Realty has been largely absent from the East Bay real estate scene over the past decade. The Irvine-based firm used to own The Towers Emeryville, three office properties located near 2100 Powell Street. The company sold the buildings to real estate investment trust KBS in 2014 for $250 million \u2014 almost double the $130 million it paid for the 814,000-square-foot property in 2010.\nLBA Realty bought the 600 Townsend Street building in San Francisco in 2023 for nearly $25.4 million, the Business Times\nreported\n. And last year, it scored the\n255 California Street\nbuilding at a value of $55 million. Both discount purchases, along with the latest in Emeryville, speak to the ongoing\nslow recovery of the broader Bay Area office market\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Five years after completing the first condo tower at Metropica, a master-planned development in western Broward County, the developer announced he is reviving the project with new partners.\nMetropica Development CEO Joseph Kavana plans to begin construction on the next phase in October, he said at a ceremonial groundbreaking this week. The developer brought on Memphis, Tennessee-based Poag Development for the retail component, and Boca Raton-based\nWaypoint\nResidential for the residential phases.\nThe more than $1.5 billion mixed-use project calls for more than 3,000 condos and apartments, 650,000 square feet of office space, 485,000 square feet of retail space and two hotels on the 65-acre property.\nPoag and Waypoint will be responsible for about $300 million worth of development, said Metropica Development President Bernard Warren. Waypoint\u2019s managing director Chris Moore said the company is committed to building at least 900 residential units in the next several years.\nKavana has had his fair share of\nsetbacks\nover the years. He began assembling the site in the early 1990s and secured approvals for the mixed-use project in 2014. But he only completed Metropica One, a 263-unit condo tower at 1800 Northwest 136th Avenue, in 2020. In 2024, he tapped brokers to find and structure a\njoint venture partnership\n. And last year, Sunrise\napproved a density boost\nthat allows the developer to spread the cost to more residential units.\n\n\u201cThis is my work, and we are going to keep fighting the same way we fought over the last 15 years to try to make this a reality,\u201d Kavana said at the event on Tuesday.\nKavana is calling the next part of the\nSunrise\nproject the first phase, which he expects will be operating within three years. That includes nearly 1,000 luxury apartments and more than 150,000 square feet of retail space. About 50,000 square feet of condo office space will be built above the retail. The retail will be \u201ccomplementary\u201d to the nearby Sawgrass Mills and will be mostly restaurants, specialty shops and entertainment, Kavana said.\nMetropica Development sold portions of the property to Poag and Waypoint, Kavana told\nThe Real Deal\n. He declined to disclose the purchase prices. Metropica Development will handle the infrastructure and has the right to participate in the joint venture.\n\u201cAll the stars are aligned right now for us to be able to carry forward. We were ready to do this back in 2020 when Covid hit, and we had just finished the first tower,\u201d Kavana said. \u201cWe were ready to start with the retail. We had to wait for the right time.\u201d\n",

The sale price of approximately $150 per square foot for the part of the complex excluding the museum is more than 85 percent below the building\u2019s pre-pandemic value of $370 million, or about $1,000 per square foot.\nThe 409,000-square-foot property contains the former Wells Fargo History Museum on Montgomery Street and a 12-story office building on California Street. The offices are mostly vacant after Wells Fargo moved much of its operations to a 620,000-square-foot lease at 333 Market Street last year.\nThe purchase comes after housing developer\nForge Development Partners\nneared a deal to buy 420 Montgomery Street for a similar price with plans to convert the building into housing. The deal ended up falling through, leaving an opening for Redco.\nWells Fargo\nsunk more than $90 million in renovations on the property over the past decade. The office tower comes with a penthouse with a kitchen, dining hall, garden and rooftop deck that can be used for events.\nRedco has big plans to remake the building, starting with rebranding the property as \u201c450 California.\u201d The company is looking to transform the lobby into a public-facing space with various food and beverage tenants including a coffee shop, bar and restaurant.\n\nAt the top of the building, Redco is hoping to bring in a single tenant to lease the upper four floors, including the penthouse. Each floor has about 27,000 square feet of offices that can be occupied by one tenant or divided between multiple.\nMeanwhile, under the building, Redco plans to convert Wells Fargo\u2019s historic bank vault with a speakeasy bar, fitness center, bowling alley and other amenities. The former Wells Fargo History Museum on the ground floor will turn into a dedicated entrance for a large tenant.\nRedco\u2019s acquisition gives the firm control of nearly two blocks on the California Street corridor. Last year, the company bought 400 Montgomery Street next door to the Wells Fargo building for $25 million and 300 California Street for $28.5 million.\nFurther south in Showplace Square, in May, Redco bought a 78,000-square-foot office building at 208 Utah Street for $15 million. That property was\npreviously owned by Shorenstein\nand was vacant after anchor tenant Strava left for new offices downtown this year.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The land is adjacent to apartments operated by Kairoi dubbed The Union at Stockyards, at 601 Stockyards Boulevard, that started construction last year and opened to its first residents in May.\nWhite Lodging hasn\u2019t settled on what it will build, but the company is weighing a hotel and restaurant or a larger mixed-use destination. Conner White, vice chair and chief investment officer, framed the Stockyards as \u201ca unique intersection of history and opportunity,\u201d and said the company wants to add to the area\u2019s fabric while delivering new experiences for locals and visitors.\n\nThe move marks White Lodging\u2019s first project in Dallas-Fort Worth in more than two decades. The company, which operates about 60 hotels and more than 50 restaurants nationwide, has a heavy Texas footprint, particularly in Austin, where it developed the\nJW Marriott\nand Austin Marriott Downtown. It also controls 16 premium-brand hotels and 20 independent food-and-beverage venues across the state.\nCompetition for dirt in the Stockyards is fierce, as redevelopment has reshaped the once-sleepy historic district into one of Fort Worth\u2019s busiest destinations.\nThe Hickman family and California-based Majestic Realty pumped $200 million into an initial phase of a $1 billion expansion that delivered the Mule Alley corridor that includes the 200-key Hotel Drover, an Autograph Collection property. That partnership has floated plans for another 300,000 square feet of retail and hospitality but is now mired in litigation between Majestic\u2019s top executive and the former head of its Stockyards operations. The shakeup led to the exit of\ntwo Majestic executives\n.\nWhite Lodging hasn\u2019t revealed a timeline, but whatever it builds will join a lineup of projects designed to keep the historic district firmly in Fort Worth\u2019s tourism spotlight.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

He also sold \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d producer Sidney Kimmel\u2019s Central Park South home for nearly $20 million and artist Abby Leigh\u2019s Upper East Side townhouse for over $20 million.\nCompass has thus far said that Anywhere\u2019s brands will maintain their independence. It also remains to be seen how antitrust regulation will factor into how Compass and its subsidiaries operate from city to city.\nCohen said he\u2019s not concerned about how the deal will play out at his new firm, which he said \u201cholds a really special place, particularly in New York City.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it will affect me,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course there will be some changes, but it\u2019s not something I\u2019m thinking about.\u201d\nCohen will join a number of other Elliman brokers who have jumped to Corcoran recently.\nLast month, one of the city\u2019s top brokers Noble Black, who ranked fourth in\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s 2024 ranking of the city\u2019s top brokers,\nbrought his team back to Corcoran\n, where he started his career. Earlier this year, veteran agents Kathy Murray and\nKirsten Jordan, along with her eponymous team\n, switched from Elliman to Corcoran.\nCorcoran hasn\u2019t been the only recipient of Elliman defectors.\nHolly Parker and her New York-based team\nand \u201cMillion Dollar Listing Los Angeles\u201d star\nTracy Tutor\nboth departed the firm for Compass this year.\n",

        "content": "AEW Capital Management and Mast Capital sold the Remi on the River apartment building on the Miami River for $108.4 million.\nBoston-based AEW and Coconut Grove-based Mast sold the eight-story, 342-unit property they completed last year at 999 Northwest Seventh Street in Miami, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The buyer is Valeris Capital, according to the sellers\u2019 news release.\nRobert Given and Troy Ballard were part of the CBRE team that represented the sellers.\nThe deal breaks down to $316,813 per apartment.\nThe buyer borrowed $72.3 million for the purchase from The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company, Vizzda records show. The loan matures in 2030.\nDesigned by Corwil Architects, Remi on the River consists of studios and one- to three-bedroom apartments. Monthly rents range from $2,300 to $4,700, the property\u2019s website shows.\nRemi on the River is the second phase of Mast and AEW\u2019s Miami River multifamily project. In 2020, they finished the first phase consisting of an eight-story, 346-unit building at 1001 Northwest Seventh Street, adjacent to Remi on the River. Grant Cardone, a motivational speaker who crowdfunds his real estate investments, bought the building for more than $100 million in 2022, incorporating it into his\n10X brand\n.\nAEW is led by CEO Jonathan Martin, and Mast is led by Camilo Miguel Jr.\n\nSouth Florida multifamily investment sales have calmed compared to during the pandemic, when an influx of out-of-staters prompted unprecedented demand, record rent growth and a flurry of sales. More recently, investment sales slowed amid elevated interest rates, a drop in rents and less demand due to slower in-migration.\nIn Miami-Dade, multifamily sales volume reached $6.2 billion in 2021 and $4.2 billion in 2022, according to data from Avison Young. Sales dropped to $1.5 billion in 2023 and $1.2 billion last year. So far this year, sales volume has picked up, hitting $940 million during the first half of this year, Avison\u2019s data shows.\nGenerally, buyers still purchasing apartments are either relying on Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae loans, or loans from insurers, which usually have better terms than bank financing. Some are all-cash buyers, and others are assuming sellers\u2019 existing debt on properties.\nIn July, Greystar paid\n$94 million\nfor the 358-unit Avana at the Moors apartment complex at 6200 Northwest 173rd Street in unincorporated Miami-Dade County. The buyer used a $65.5 million Freddie Mac loan.\nBlackstone bought the 359-unit Solea at Miami Lakes apartment complex at 17405 Northwest 94th Court in Miami Lakes for\n$115.9 million\nin April.\nLast month, health care honcho Rudy Rodriguez-Duret bought the 129-unit Sunset Apartments at 8951 Sunset Drive in Miami-Dade\u2019s Kendall neighborhood for\n$28.3 million\n; and FCP bought the 427-unit District West Gables at 2001 and 2101 Ludlam Road/Southwest 67th Avenue in West Miami for\n$111 million\n.\nAlso last month, Legacy Residential Group paid\n$77 million\nfor the 416-unit Legacy at Coconut Creek complex at 4303 West Atlantic Boulevard in Coconut Creek.\n",

        "content": "Arnaud Karsenti\u2019s 13th Floor Investments is partnering with a Dubai-based hospitality firm to develop the first Siro hotel in the U.S. in Miami\u2019s Brickell.\n13th Floor and Ian Ludmir\u2019s Forse Holdings, both based in Miami, are the local partners of Kerzner International\u2019s planned Siro Brickell, Miami tower. It will consist of 180 hotel rooms and suites, as well as 350 Siro-branded condos, according to a 13th Floor news release.\nKerzner, the Dubai firm, bought the nearly 1-acre development site at Brickell City Centre in August for\n$45 million\n. The property is at 9 Southeast Sixth Street in Miami.\nKerzner created the Siro brand as part of its hotel portfolio last year. The hotels have a focus on health and wellness, including on reducing jetlag and promoting sleep, the release says. Siro hotels also have fitness facilities and customizable nutritional offerings.\nSiro Brickell is expected to open in 2030, according to the release. It will mark the sixth Siro hotel, including those Kerzner opened and plans. On tap are Siro Palmilla in Los Cabos, Mexico, expected to open in 2027; SIRO Olaya in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, expected to open in 2028; and SIRO Roponghi in Tokyo, expected to open in 2029. Already open are Siro One Za\u2019abeel in Dubai and Siro Boka Place in Montenegro, according to the release.\nLed by Philippe Zuber, Kerzner\u2019s other brands include Atlantis Resorts, One&amp;Only and Rare Finds. The firm was founded in 1993 by late South African business tycoon Solomon \u2018Sol\u2019 Kerzner.\nSwire Properties, the real estate arm of Hong Kong-based Swire, developed the Brickell City Centre mixed-use complex, completing it in 2016, and sold the Siro development site to Kerzner.\n\nThe deal was part of Swire\u2019s divestment in recent months from its remaining Brickell City Centre holdings. In May, Swire sold the 2.8-acre development site where it had planned an office supertall to Melo Group for\n$211.5 million\n, after canceling the project. Swire also sold its remaining stake in Brickell City Centre\u2019s retail and parking to Simon Property Group for\n$512 million\nin June.\nBrickell\nbecame South Florida\u2019s darling market in recent years, attracting new-to-market office leases, as well as commercial and residential development.\nMore recently, higher interest rates and fewer out-of-state businesses and residents have slowed the South Florida boom. Generally, all-cash buyers have remained active, and some projects are pending.\nSpanish billionaire Amancio Ortega, founder of the Inditex holding company, is expected to purchase the Sabadell Financial Center office tower at 1111 Brickell Avenue for\n$275 million\n. Ortega, who makes real estate investments through his Ponte Gadea firm, is known for making all-cash purchases.\nLast month, funds affiliated with Blackstone bought the East Miami hotel, which is at Brickell City Centre, for nearly\n$300 million\nfrom funds managed by Trinity Investments and Certares.\nPlanned projects in Brickell include Yamal Yidios\u2019 Ytech firm\u2019s proposed\n54-story, 113-unit\ncondo tower at 41 and 75 Broadway; and Chilean developer Claudio Fischer\u2019s proposed\n41-story, 544-unit\nresidential tower on the former Mexican Consulate site in Miami\u2019s Brickell.\nAlso in Brickell, 13th Floor and the Ardid family\u2019s Miami-based Key International want to develop an\n80-story condo tower\nbehind First Miami Presbyterian Church at 609 Brickell Avenue. The project would replace the church\u2019s parking lot and school building, while the church itself will remain intact.\n",

        "content": "Rockwood Capital may be out of time. Special servicer Rialto Capital Advisors sued a company connected to Rockwood over a loan secured by the Santa Monica Clock Tower, once the city\u2019s largest skyscraper.\nRockwood assumed $26.7 million in commercial mortgage-backed securities\ndebt\nwhen it purchased the 12-story office building in 2019. Rialto alleges that Rockwood defaulted when the debt matured in May and owes about $25 million.\nRockwood\npurchased\nthe property, at 225 Santa Monica Boulevard overlooking the Pacific Ocean, from Sorgente Group of America six years ago for $58 million, or $1,084 per square foot. The alleged default amount works out to $447 per square foot.\nThe loan\nlanded\nin special servicing right before the local landmark\u2019s value was downgraded. Its value\ndeclined\nto $27.4 million in July compared to $49 million in 2015, according to Morningstar Credit. Occupancy is an issue: It stands at 43 percent, per Morningstar.\n\nRockwood Capital and managing partners David Becker and Tyson Skillings and attorneys for Rialto did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nRialto wants to foreclose on the Santa Monica Clock Tower and sell it. The special servicer requested a court-appointed receiver to take possession of the 53,500-square-foot, century-old, Art Deco building. Special servicers act on behalf of lenders; in this case, the loan was originated by German American Capital Corporation but was then sold off to investors in commercial mortgage-backed securities.\nRockwood expressed interest in transferring the title back to the lender, according to servicer commentary via Morningstar.\nSanta Monica offices have a 24 percent vacancy rate, according to a second quarter CBRE report. That isn\u2019t much worse than all of West Los Angeles, which has a 22 percent vacancy rate, but goes to show that the beachside city\u2019s office market hasn\u2019t seen a post-pandemic revival.\n",

        "content": "Chicago is taking fire from President Donald Trump, but visitors don\u2019t seem to mind.\nHotels in the\nCentral Business District\nbooked nearly 3.6 million room nights from June through August \u2014 a 4.3 percent gain over last summer that also topped the pre-pandemic high in 2019, according to Choose Chicago. The strong showing helped generate a record $949 million in hotel revenue for the summer, a 0.8 percent uptick from last year, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nChoose Chicago CEO Kristen Reynolds credited the record-shattering summer with a surge in regional travelers, which offset weaker international travel.\nDomestic tourism carried the season, with suburbanites and visitors within a five-hour drive filling rooms. International travel fell 3 percent year-over-year, dampened by Trump\u2019s hardline immigration and trade policies, while his repeated threats of federal intervention in Chicago haven\u2019t boosted the city\u2019s image abroad. Still, Reynolds said the drive market momentum is reshaping the city\u2019s tourism pitch.\n\nThe four biggest hotel weekends in city history all happened this summer: Blackpink\u2019s Soldier Field concert and a Nike youth tournament at McCormick Place led the pack with 92,643 room nights in July. Pride Fest,\nLollapalooza\nand Labor Day weekend each topped 91,000. Notably absent was NASCAR\u2019s Chicago Street Race, which is on pause until at least 2027.\nEven with the high occupancy and revenue, hotel owners aren\u2019t celebrating like it\u2019s 2019. Rising labor and construction costs, plus heavier property tax bills, have eaten into margins. Michael Jacobson, who leads the Illinois Hotel &amp; Lodging Association, warned that operators \u201ccannot rest on recent successes\u201d given ongoing cost pressures and economic uncertainty.\nThe city drew 55.3 million visitors last year, up 6.3 percent from 2023, but still shy of the 61.6 million peak in\n2019\n. Events are a key draw \u2014 and with Taylor Swift skipping this year and the\nDemocratic National Convention\nstill ahead in 2028, hotels are banking on a steady pipeline of sports, music and cultural festivals to keep the rooms full.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Foty is a principal with Rise Group Investments; Ganim is with Regional Properties Texas.\nMarcus &amp; Millichap\u2019s Chris Gaine and Philip Levy had the listing.\nDeed records show Charles Lucenay is the seller. He\u2019s the Houston-based owner of Cornerstone Commercial Properties. Foty and Ganim bought the property with an $11.7 million mortgage from Bank of Houston.\nSquare 67 sits on 17 acres and is 99 percent occupied, the release said. It is home to Fitness Connection and Family Dollar. The 25-suite retail strip is 2 miles from the Shops at Redbird, a landmark shopping mall in southern Dallas that\u2019s undergoing redevelopment. Developer Peter Brodsky purchased Red Bird in 2015. The mall is now home to apartments, a Dallas College workforce center, a day care, a Parkland Health Clinic and an outpost of UT Southwestern medical center.\n\nThe purchase comes a few months after Foty and Ganim purchased a similar property in Houston. Over the summer , they bought Woodforest Shopping Center, at 10907-11095 East Freeway, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n. The 197,000-square-foot retail center was last valued at $11.9 million and was 96 percent occupied at time of the trade.\nRetail has proven to be a wise real estate investment after warnings about the death knell of retail after the Great Financial Crisis kept developers from building new products. As a result, space is limited and rents are high.\nIn Dallas-Fort Worth,\nretail rents are up from a year ago\n, increasing from $19.78 to $20.28 per square foot, according to Partners Real Estate. Vacancy rates are stable at 4.8 percent.\nThe market\u2019s stability means it\u2019s able to weather the\nclosure of big-box retailers, like Party City\n. The space has been gobbled up by\nexperiential users like gyms\nand even bookseller\nBarnes &amp; Noble, which is having a renaissance\n.\n",

        "content": "Benjamin Duell, a scion of New York real estate\u2019s Duell family, dropped $28.3 million on a penthouse in the recently completed Fort\u00e9 on Flagler in West Palm Beach.\nRecords show WPB Lower Penthouse LLC, a Florida entity managed by Duell, bought unit 2401 at 1309 South Flagler Drive from an affiliate of developers Two Roads Development and Alpha Blue Ventures.\nDuell is the son of Irene and\nManny Duell\n, the late developer of 1045 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, according to reports. Last year, the family listed a portfolio of properties for\n$300 million\n. They sold the building at 673 Madison Avenue for\nmore than $30 million\nto Friedland Properties in September of last year, after deciding to sell the portfolio in parts rather than as a whole. In 2015, they sold the building at 712 Madison Avenue for\n$83 million\n.\n\nDuell\u2019s penthouse spans 9,200 square feet, four bedrooms, four bathrooms, and two half-bathrooms, according to Zillow. Fort\u00e9\u2019s design team includes Arquitectonica and interiors firm Jean-Louis Deniot. The building has amenities like a pool, fitness center, spa facilities,\nguest suites\n,\nprivate dining room\n, library and business center.\nWest Palm Beach-based Two Roads is led by co-managing partners Reid Boren and Taylor Collins, who partnered with Marius Fortelni and Scott Maslin\u2019s Alpha Blue on the 25-story, 40-unit Fort\u00e9 tower.\nClosings began in July\n, and buyers so far have included New York Times heiress\nCynthia Sulzberger\n, Fox News contributor Liz Peek, and Michael Ainslie, the former president and CEO of Sotheby\u2019s Holdings.\nThe building did not sell out entirely, though. Christian Angle with Christian Angle Real Estate has the listing for the primary penthouse, which is asking $47.5 million. John Reynolds with Douglas Elliman and Gary Pohrer with Serhant share the listings for two other units, 2202 and 2302, which are asking $14.7 million and $15.3 million, respectively.",

        "content": "It\u2019s been eight months since the deadly Palisades and Eaton fires ripped through the Greater Los Angeles region, and if other parts of California scarred by fires are any indication, the communities that will reemerge from the ashes will be largely unrecognizable.\nResidents new and old are moving into areas damaged by wildfires, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n.\nTake the Northern California town of Paradise, burned by the 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest in the state\u2019s history.\nParadise native Jen Goodlin returned to her hometown six months after the 2018 Camp fire with plans to rebuild. Her family bought a lot where they parked a trailer, and eventually they moved into a new four-bedroom house. As younger residents like her are attracted to cheap land and room to rebuild, the demographics of the town have changed significantly from once being dominated by retirees. \u201cIt took the fire to bring me home,\u201d she told the Times.\nWhile less than a third of the 10,700 homes destroyed in the\nCamp fire\nhave been rebuilt, Paradise is still humming with life, the Times reported. Parks are open, construction crews work as taco trucks provide food for workers and residents, and registration for Little League is higher than they were before the 2018 fire. What\u2019s more, the new homes are often bigger as returning owners buy up adjacent lots and outsiders move in.\nRenters and low-income residents, however, have a different story.\n\nIn the Paradise area, many have moved into nearby Chico and other urban areas with more state-backed affordable housing projects away from fire-prone regions. In Santa Rosa, the 2017 Tubbs fire destroyed the Journey\u2019s End mobile home park, which provided housing to seniors on fixed incomes. It was later redeveloped into new apartments, but few former residents were able to return. Meanwhile, Santa Rose\u2019s formerly middle-class Coffey Park subdivision was rebuilt with homes now selling for more than $1 million, per the Times.\nCamp fire recovery has been slow and steady, though the\nrebuilding\nefforts after the 2020 North Complex fire in Butte County\u2019s Berry Creek has been even slower.\nOnly 5 percent of the nearly 1,500 homes have been rebuilt, the Times\nreported\n. That marks the lowest recovery rate of any major\nCalifornia fire\nin the past eight years. By contrast, about 30 percent of its housing stock has been replaced, thanks in part to billions in settlements and government aid. Berry Creek residents, however, were largely uninsured or underinsured; plus, because the fire was sparked by lightning, there was no legal standing to sue and little public attention or private donations. As a result, hundreds of residents are still living in trailers, recreational vehicles and makeshift shelters as officials direct affordable housing funds to\ndenser hubs\nlike Chico and Oroville.\nAs wildfires continue to spark across California, the divide between suburban and rural fire zones could become more pronounced.\nIn unincorporated parts of Los Angeles County torched by the Palisades and Eaton fires, 469 building permits have been issued so far,\naccording\nto the county\u2019s permitting dashboard. More than 16,000 structures were\ntorched\nin the January wildfires.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Construction workers in the City of Los Angeles could see the floor for their wages get considerably higher.\nOn Tuesday, Los Angeles City Councilmembers\nCurren Price\nand Hugo Soto-Mart\u00ednez introduced a motion to commission a study on the effects of setting a $32.35 minimum wage for all residential construction projects in the city with 10 or more residential units and under 85 feet in height, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n.\nIn addition to investigating the effects of such a minimum wage increase, the study would also examine the impact of an additional healthcare credit of $7.65 per hour for construction workers on such projects, according to the Times.\nPrice and Soto-Mart\u00ednez\u2019s motion argues that increasing wages and benefits is a necessary step to bring in more workers as the city continues to rebuild after the Palisades and Eaton fires. As fears across the construction world mount amid ongoing Immigrations and Customs Enforcement raids, demand for labor has surged as workers leave the industry.\n\u201cWe cannot allow an underground economy to continue exploiting vulnerable workers while\nour housing crisis\ndeepens,\u201d Price said in a press release, calling a\nconstruction worker minimum wage\nincrease \u201ca common-sense step toward dignity, stability and fairness in one of our city\u2019s most critical industries.\u201d\n\u201cConstruction workers who build housing in Los Angeles should be able to afford to live in Los Angeles,\u201d Soto-Mart\u00ednez added.\nCouncilmembers Bob Blumenfield, Heather Hutt, Eunisses Hernandez and Ysabel Jurado joined Price and Soto-Mart\u00ednez in their support for the motion. Construction unions and housing groups such as Abundant Housing L.A. and Housing Action Coalition have also voiced their support for a wage increase, according to the Times.\n\n\u201cThese are workers who can\u2019t afford a roof over their head, yet we rely on them to build the roofs over our own,\u201d Pete Rodriguez, western district vice president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, said.\nUnder the proposal, construction projects that already pay union-level prevailing wage and benefits would be exempt.\nThe idea drew backlash from Stuart Waldman, president of the Valley Industry and Commerce Association, who called the idea \u201cabsolute insanity,\u201d according to the Times. Many apartment\ndevelopers already have been avoiding building in L.A.\npartially because of\nMeasure ULA\n. \u201cThis will drive what little construction we have out of L.A.,\u201d Waldman said.\nA similar minimum wage increase for hotel and airport workers in Los Angeles faced\nsimilar pushback from business owners\n. Opponents sought to repeal the city\u2019s $30 minimum wage ordinance but failed to secure the minimum number of valid signatures needed to put the repeal before voters in a referendum.\nThe construction worker wage motion will proceed to a committee hearing.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

A record of the deal has not yet been recorded with the Los Angeles County recorder, leaving details of the buyer unknown at this time. Ramirez, reached Wednesday afternoon, was not immediately able to share client details.\nThe buyer nabbed a slight discount from the original list price, while Thorne walks away with about $600,000 more than what she paid for the home in 2019.\nThorne\u2019s breakout role was playing CeCe Jones on the Disney Channel series \u201cShake It Up.\u201d Since then, she\u2019s starred in \u201cFamous in Love,\u201d \u201cBlended,\u201d \u201cThe Duff\u201d and \u201cAmityville: The Awakening.\u201d\nThe Topanga property sits on an expansive 10-acre lot with the living space totaling about 7,600 square feet, with 360-degree views of the city, mountains and ocean.\n\nA gated, private road takes visitors up to the estate, where there\u2019s a roundabout and three-car garage. Outdoors, there\u2019s a pool, waterfall and BBQ area for entertaining.\nThe property is split between a 6,679-square-foot main house and a 945-square-foot guest house. Highlights of the main home include five ensuite bedrooms, arched windows, French doors and hardwood floors.\nThe detached guest house has its own two-car garage, living room and ensuite bedroom.\nThorne added some of her own personal design elements to the property, including a floral installation wrapping the stairs of the main home\u2019s foyer. The installation was created by florist Kristen Alpaugh and was part of the deal.\nThe median sale price of a home in\nTopanga\n, which is an unincorporated part of Los Angeles County, is $1.6 million, according to\nRedfin\ndata from August. That\u2019s down 20 percent year over year. Homes available for sale typically sell in a little over 90 days, which is up from 60 in 2024, per the Redfin data.\n",

CoStar first reported Crescent as the buyer. The valuation amounts to $638 per square foot.\nThat price eclipses the $218 million Uptown Link sale to Cousins Properties in August, setting a high-water mark for this year.\nThe 21-story tower, built in 2008, had only been on the market since\nJune\n. Union acquired it in 2016 for $226 million and listed it this summer with occupancy at 83 percent.

The firm already controls about a fifth of the district\u2019s office assets and is best known for the\nCrescent\ncomplex, a mixed-use campus that\u2019s long been a\nclubhouse\nfor Dallas\u2019 financial elite.\n\nTexas Capital Bank anchors the building, with a lease through 2040 that tripled its space and locked in naming rights.

During the same time frame, the number of active listings rose 7 percent from roughly 7,200 to 7,700.\nWhile elevated mortgage rates depressed sales across the country, transactions in Manhattan beat the decade norm. The number of sales was up about 1 percent from the long-term average of 3,030.\nThe borough\u2019s median price also increased nearly 6 percent year-over-year to just under $1.2 million.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing falling months of supply and rising sales outpacing that, which is keeping pressure on housing prices,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAffordability is still being tested.\u201d\nMortgage rates\nbegan dropping\nmidway through the third quarter, though Miller said the impact of that decline isn\u2019t yet evident in the data, given that prices remain high and most sales went to cash buyers.\n\nCash deals accounted for 65 percent of those transactions, with the number of all-cash deals rising 31 percent annually and the number of financed deals declining 9 percent.\n\u201cHigher-end consumers are better equipped to deal with elevated mortgage rates,\u201d Miller said, though he cautioned that \u201chigher-end\u201d isn\u2019t limited to the ultra-luxury sector.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t want to over-subscribe to the idea that these are all super luxury or super wealthy buyers. They\u2019re not.\u201d\nMany expect the Federal Reserve to announce two additional\ninterest rate cuts\nthis year, which could hold rates steady at their current lower levels or drive them down further.\nAn interest rate cut \u201cdoesn\u2019t guarantee that mortgage rates will fall, but it certainly helps given how damaged the job market has been,\u201d Miller said.\nHe added that a decline in mortgage rates could also\nease pressure\non the city\u2019s rental market, which has logged record highs in five of the last eight months.\nIf lower mortgage rates continue, \u201cwe\u2019ll see the rental market step back a little bit,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019ll be a dramatic improvement in affordability, but a reset to more stability.\u201d\nThe dip in mortgage rates will likely have a larger impact on results for the fourth quarter, Miller said, including an increase in deals at the lower end of the market compared to those at the higher end.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of pent-up demand in the market,\u201d Miller said, which could translate to a \u201crobust Q4 if mortgage rates fall.\u201d\n",

        "content": "With Mayor Eric Adams out of the race, some in the real estate industry see a path to victory for Andrew Cuomo. Others think nothing has changed.\nOn Monday, an email urged recipients to donate to Cuomo. This was one day after the mayor dropped his re-election bid and was the final day of fundraising before the next deadline for campaigns to file their contributions received between Aug. 19 and Sept. 29.\n\u201cWith Mayor Adams stepping out of the race, today marks a pivotal moment in the NYC mayoral election,\u201d it stated. \u201cToday is the day to support the Andrew Cuomo campaign so he can defend NYC against radical socialist policies.\u201d\nJared Epstein, president of development firm Aurora Capital Associates, who sent the email, says the effort helped raise $80,000, potentially more than $500,000 with public matching funds (though that has yet to be determined).\nEpstein thinks with Adams out, Cuomo can consolidate moderate voters. He acknowledged that some in the industry are not as optimistic.\n\u201cSome people talk like Mamdani\u2019s inevitable, but New Yorkers don\u2019t back inevitability, they back resilience,\u201d he said in an email.\nMeanwhile, one industry source told me that, absent Sliwa dropping out or an act of God, Mamdani is likely to be the next mayor. Believing he will likely be their next mayor, some in the industry have been focusing on ways to work with Mamdani.\nA poll released this month (before Adams bowed out) found that 46 percent of likely voters intend to cast their ballot for Zohran Mamdani. The poll, by the New York Times and Siena University, showed Cuomo in second with 24, but those margins narrow if Sliwa drops out. If the general election ends up being a two-way contest between Mamdani and Cuomo, the former would take 48 percent of the vote and the latter 44 percent, according to the poll.\nBut Sliwa has maintained that he won\u2019t quit the race.\nMamdani held a press conference on Tuesday outside 220 Central Park South \u2014 where the penthouse sold in 2025 for nearly $240 million \u2014\u00a0to criticize reports that Cuomo hit the phones after Adams dropped out of the race seeking donations ahead of the fundraising deadline.\n\u200b\u200b\u201cWe know that what billionaires and C-suite executives are once again trying to buy their way out of is a city that working people can actually afford \u2014 a city where the concerns of those people will be at the forefront and at the heart of our politics,\u201d Mamdani said in a statement.\nThe next set of campaign finance filings won\u2019t show us how real estate donors reacted to the news of Adams dropping out of the race, but activity over the next couple of weeks could provide more insight into whether more folks are holding out hope for Cuomo or have made peace with a Mamdani administration.\n\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill real estate try to appeal to the Trump administration on its decision to withhold billions of dollars from key NYC infrastructure projects? Will, say, the\nlargest property owner in the Penn Station area\nmake a call? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nCasinos play a major role in the fifth season of the show \u201cOnly Murders in the Building.\u201d For one, an illicit but grand casino is discovered in the subterranean levels of the fictional Arconia (the real-life Belnord) and figures into the aforementioned murders in the building. In the sixth episode, Oliver (Martin Short) and Loretta (Meryl Streep) are walking around Flatbush when they are asked by a man with a clipboard if they care about dogs dying. His mission isn\u2019t canine rescue, though: He\u2019s actually collecting signatures against opening a casino in New York City, noting that there are several competing bids.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 The Trump administration announced Wednesday that it is withholding $18 billion in federal funding for two key infrastructure projects in New York,\nPolitico New York reports\n. White House budget director Russell Vought said funding would be withheld from the Gateway Program, a new train tunnel under the Hudson River and the next phase of the Second Avenue subway, due to \u201cunconstitutional DEI principles.\u201d In a separate statement, the U.S. Department of Transportation indicated that funding for the projects was under review, to determine \u201cwhether any unconstitutional practices are occurring.\u201d The statement noted that the shutdown of the federal government meant that the review would take more time.\n\u2014 In his first public appearance since ending his reelection campaign, Mayor Eric Adams had a message for the next mayor: Don\u2019t f-it up. \u201cThis city is in good shape, and we need to make sure we don\u2019t go backwards,\u201d he said on Wednesday,\nGothamist reports\n. \u201cAnd let me say in the words of Bloomberg when I became mayor, \u2018Don\u2019t f\u2014 it up.\u2019\u201d\n\u2014 A NYCHA building in the Bronx partially collapsed on Wednesday after a gas explosion in the property\u2019s chimney shaft,\nWABC reports\n. No injuries were reported, and city officials are investigating the cause of the explosion.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$26.5 million\nfor a 9,652-square-foot single-family house at 11 West 12th Street in Greenwich Village.\nMark Fromm and Claudia Saez-Fromm with Douglas Elliman\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$7 million\nfor a 12,295-square-foot commercial property at 1619 Broadway in Midtown.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$32 million\nfor a 4,028-square-foot condominium unit at 432 Park Avenue in Midtown East. Anne Prosser with Brown Harris Stevens has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 47,984-square-foot, five-story school facility at 560 McDonald Avenue in Kensington. Lester Katz filed the permit on behalf of Jacob Bar Horin.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

Benner,\ngeneral counsel at Tishman Speyer, purchased a single-family home at\n104 Willow Street\nfor $11.3 million.

        "content": "More apartment towers are hitting the market in Chicago as the city and, more broadly, the Midwest, near the top nationally in rent growth, prompting\ndroves of listings\n.\nIn Lincoln Park, condo deconversion specialists Yitzy Klor and Saul Kupperwasser of\nStrategic Properties of North America\nare listing the K Square Apartments at 1749 North Wells Street. And a bit further north, Waterton is listing the Montrose Apartments in Buena Park at 4334 North Hazel Street.\nBoth SPNA and Waterton tapped Berkadia brokers Nick Harris, Pete Evans and Richard Evans to market the buildings. The brokers and a representative of Waterton declined to comment on the listings and representatives of SPNA.\nK Square Apartments\nKlor and Kupperwasser are hoping to cash in on the 268-unit K Square property after they converted it from condos to rentals in 2018.\nSkokie-based SPNA\npreviously listed the building\nbuilding with CBRE in 2023 but didn\u2019t end up selling it. It\u2019s unclear why the 22-story property didn\u2019t trade hands at the time but it appears SPNA is ready to try again.\nWhen the firm initially listed the property, it was fresh off of a separate failed deconversion deal at the Ontario Place condominiums in River North\nThe company had bought dozens of condos at the 467-unit building, after three years of negotiations, failed to close a $190 million purchase of the remaining units. The deal imploded in June 2023 when SPNA failed to put up $700,000 as a show of good faith to the remaining sellers.\nThings haven\u2019t been going much better since then. SPNA fumbled a second condo deconversion deal at 200 North Dearborn in 2024. The building\u2019s condo board voted to terminate an agreement with SPNA to sell the building\u2019s remaining units for $90 million after the company failed repeatedly to secure the financing needed to close the deal.\nStill, the time could be right for SPNA to score a win with the sale of the K Square Apartments. Chicago\u2019s multifamily market notched rent growth of 3.8 percent year-over-year in the second quarter, bested only by San Francisco\u2019s 5.1 percent rate, according to\nApartments.com\ndata. Plus, Klor in May saved a deal that one of his firm\u2019s affiliates looked set to lose to distress by getting a new $21 million loan for the 68-unit property at\n1211 North LaSalle Street\nto resolve a foreclosure lawsuit.\n\nWhile high interest rates have been tempering investors, SPNA is offering an assumable Fannie Mae loan that carries a 2.74 percent interest rate with a 2030 maturity date. The landlord refinanced the building with an $88 million loan in 2020 when rates were significantly lower than they are today.\nThe property was originally built as condos in 1971 before SPNA converted it into a standard rental building in 2018.\nThe Montrose Apartments\nIn Buena Park, multifamily heavy hitter Waterton is looking to offload the Montrose Apartments which the firm has owned since 2015.\nWaterton purchased the 18-story, 287-unit building for $65 million, with a $61 million mortgage from JPMorgan. The deal came out to $226,000 per unit.\nThe building is anchored by a ground floor Jewel Osco grocery store in the up-and-coming North Side neighborhood.\nUnits range from studios to 2-bedroom and 2-bathroom units with footprints of 520 to 1,025 square feet. Rents currently range from $1,770 to $4,850, according to Waterton\u2019s website.\nThe Chicago-based multifamily owner and operator has been active in the market recently with two recent purchases and one new listing.\nLast month, the firm dropped\n$90 million to buy a 263-unit building\nknown as the Mason in buzzy Fulton Market. The price came out to about $342,000 per unit. Over the summer, it made a\n$167 million purchase in the Los Angeles area\nof a 522-unit property.\nBack in Chicago, Waterton earlier this year listed the\n346-unit Grand Central apartments\nin the South Loop for sale, two years after acquiring it for $81.9 million.",

        "content": "A Schaumburg neighborhood is set to vanish under a proposal for two massive warehouses next to Experior Logistics\u2019 trucking hub.\nChicago-based Logistics Property Company lined up contracts for all 25 parcels along Long Avenue, including\n19 homes\n, to make way for a pair of speculative\nindustrial buildings\ntotaling 436,500 square feet on 70 acres, the Daily Herald\nreported\n. The company expects to close on the properties this winter.\nFor homeowners, the shift is bittersweet. Dina Menini, who has lived on Long Avenue for 25 years, said she once couldn\u2019t imagine leaving. But the arrival of Experior\u2019s 55-acre campus, and the round-the-clock noise of idling trucks, upended the rural atmosphere that drew residents there.\n\u201cNobody\u2019s going to want to buy our houses,\u201d she told the outlet. Menini, who owns a trucking company herself, described Logistics Property\u2019s offer as fair, but admitted the sale is emotional.\nThe homes, most built in the 1960s and 1970s, will be demolished if the project proceeds. Menini said she rebuilt her home 11 years ago. Some land in the assemblage is owned by the village, and\nSchaumburg\nofficials are already weighing how to support the redevelopment. The village is considering annexation and a tax-increment financing district to fund infrastructure improvements tied to the project.\n\nA study commissioned by the village projected the site\u2019s equalized assessed value would grow from $2.8 million today to $53.5 million over the 23-year life of a\npotential TIF\n. A review board of local taxing bodies meets later this month, with\u00a0 possible approval in December.\nIf greenlit, the development would cement the transformation of this southwest Schaumburg pocket from a residential enclave into a logistics hub.\nThe city\u2019s deal with Experior included a requirement for Experior to construct a bike path connecting Schaumburg\u2019s Metra Station to Rodenburg Road through the property, according to city documents. Its complex includes a 140,000-square-foot headquarters, warehouse space and a filling station for trucks.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The California Public Utilities Commission might be moving out of its longtime home in San Francisco.\nThe California Department of General Services floated moving the commission\u2019s staff from the Governor Edmund G. \u201cPat\u201d Brown Building at 505 Van Ness Avenue to the nearby Ronald M. George State Office Complex at 455 Golden Gate Avenue, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nIf the utilities commission decamps from the Pat Brown Building, the state could opt to sell the building, though other options have also been studied. A plan to renovate the building was rejected because of its projected cost of $880 million. The Ronald M. George Complex currently houses courtrooms, including the\nCalifornia Supreme Court\n.\nThe Department of General Services\u2019 recommendations to move staff comes after a review of the state\u2019s office portfolio, which is done every two years to identify places to save money. The post-pandemic proliferation of remote work prompted the state to clamp down further on owning excessive space at the risk of spending money unnecessarily.\n\nSome buildings under the Department of General Services\u2019 control are already on the sales block. Some of them are poised for transformation into housing. As for the RMG Complex, it could likely be headed to a renovation, though the government didn\u2019t disclose a cost estimate for such a project. The future of the Pat Brown Building remains uncertain, as the utility commission is the sole tenant at the property.\nThe state\u2019s office needs in San Francisco are projected to drop by up to 30 percent amid the shift to hybrid work and the overhaul of its real estate portfolio. With direct asking\nrents in San Francisco\nat $69 per square foot compared to a $36 average across the country, it appears more likely that employees will consolidate into the RMG Complex. If the Pat Brown Building is deemed to be surplus property, it could be converted into housing, similar to other state\noffice-to-residential projects\nin San Diego, Fresno and\nSan Jose\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

A tenant has not yet been secured.\nSchafer Smartt, vice president at\nLarkspur\n, said the space is one of the few buildings in the district that has architecturally significant features worth retrofitting, noting the site\u2019s industrial heritage. Renovation work will start once a lease is inked, DBA\u2019s Austin Schenkel said. Line Design, known for adaptive reuse, is leading the design.\n\nThe development is meant to sync with the first vertical phase of Westside Village, set to start construction early next year at 100 North University Drive. That phase includes a $125 million, 308-unit luxury apartment building with a 716-space garage and a 100,000-square-foot Class AA office tower with retail, two restaurants and a private social club. Michael Hsu Office of Architecture is designing the office component, while Corgan is overseeing the residential piece. Completion is slated for 2028.\nThe broader\nWestside Village\nplan includes 880,000 square feet of office space, 238,000 square feet of retail, nearly 1,800 apartments, a 175-key hotel and $45 million in infrastructure upgrades by 2034. It would mark Fort Worth\u2019s largest office delivery in more than four decades.\nTo unlock a public incentive package\napproved this summer\n, the developers must invest at least $410 million and hit hard-construction spending of $311 million by 2030. Minimum requirements include 200,000 square feet of office, 95,000 square feet of retail and a hotel of at least 150 rooms.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Developer David Martin has set his sights on his next challenge, a redevelopment of the Miami Seaquarium property in Key Biscayne.\nAn affiliate of his Coconut Grove-based firm,\nTerra\n, has a $22.5 million deal in place to take over the lease for the 38-property at 4400 Rickenbacker Causeway, which is owned by Miami-Dade County. Resilient Aquarium LLC, the Terra entity, plans to renovate and modernize the Seaquarium. The marine mammals will be relocated under the proposal, according to a filing in Delaware\u2019s bankruptcy court. The current operator, MS Leisure Company, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April.\nIntegra Investments was among the companies to submit a proposal.\nThe Seaquarium has been operational since 1954. Miami-Dade County first moved to evict the company last year, but the\neviction proceedings\nwere stayed as a result of the bankruptcy filing. Miami-Dade alleged that the operator failed to maintain Miami Seaquarium in good repair and clean condition, and that it violated the federal Marine Mammal Act and Animal Welfare Act, citing substandard animal care. In 2023, the orca Tokitae, also known as Lolita, died in her tank of renal failure, following a decades-long effort by activists to retire her to a sanctuary.\nThe existing lease is set to expire in November 2044.\nTerra\u2019s plans\nMartin\n, CEO of Terra, plans to invest between $75 million and $100 million into the Seaquarium property, which will likely include adding restaurants, retail and a new marina with wet and dry boat storage for up to 350 vessels, he told Channel 10. Court filings show he plans a new accredited aquarium; marina and aquatic experiences; wellness spaces; a fisherman\u2019s village; and an education, conservation and research center. The historic Buckminster Fuller Seaquarium dome would be preserved and repurposed for event space.\n\nMS Leisure\u2019s parent company, the Mexico-based Dolphin Company, is developing a plan to transfer animals to alternative locations, and hired International Animal Exchange to handle the process.\nThe timeline\nA bankruptcy judge in Delaware has to sign off on the sale of the lease and is expected to rule on it at a 10 a.m. hearing on Oct. 17. Objections must be filed on or before Oct. 10 at 4 p.m. Miami-Dade County Commissioners also have to approve the deal at a later, unspecified date.\nIf the judge approves the lease transfer, the Seaquarium will close by the end of the year. The actual sale and transfer of the lease will occur 30 days after the final county approval, and no later than May 15, 2026.\nTerra\u2019s other projects\nMartin has long pitched himself and his company as a sustainable developer. He\u2019s partnering with the owner of\nJungle Island\nto redevelop a portion of the Watson Island property in Miami into a condo tower and a public park. Parks are often part of his developments, including the aptly named\nFive Park\nin Miami Beach, which has a 3-acre park that features an interactive playground, botanical garden, dog park and event lawn.\nHis other projects include the planned luxury condo tower at 1250 West Avenue in Miami Beach; the redevelopment of the\nDeauville Beach Resort\nproperty in Miami Beach; the Miami Beach Convention Center Hotel; the redevelopment of the Silver Sands Beach Resort property with Fortune International Group in Key Biscayne; and the Well-branded condo project in Coconut Grove.\n",

The area, now known as the \u201c710 stub,\u201d was cleared in the 1970s as part of the planned highway extension, displacing many low-income and minority residents in the process. Caltrans seized 400 homes by eminent domain for this effort in the 1960s.\nGetting movement on deals for the state-owned \u201cStub\u201d\u2013which comprises 400 parcels altogether\u2013 land has been a glacial process.\n\u201cWe\u2019re behind where we should be, without a question,\u201d Pasadena City Council member Steve Madison\ntold\nThe Real Deal\nin July\n.\n\u201cThe bottleneck is the city council, and in particular, the mayor [Victor Gordo].\u201d\n\nThe City is required to deploy the sales proceeds from the\nCaltrans\nproperties toward affordable housing by Dec. 31, 2026.\nPasadena officials identified four smaller non-historic properties as potential sites for affordable homes for sale. The remaining 13 properties will be listed on the MLS for fair market value,\naccording\nto an announcement from the city.\nBrokers will begin marketing the first 10 properties this week, according to the City of\nPasadena\n. Marketing for the other three addresses will begin this month. All properties will be sold as-is and will be subject to deed restrictions wherein the buyer would be required to repair the property and ensure it\u2019s ready for\noccupancy\nwithin a reasonable timeframe.\nUnder Pasadena\u2019s\nHousing Element\n, the city is required to plan for 9,429 units of new housing by October 2029. Of that, 2,747 must be very-low-income units, 1,662 units of low-income housing, 1,565 units of moderate-income housing and 3,455 units of above-moderate-income housing. In Los Angeles County, very-low-income is\ndefined\nas a maximum annual income of $53,000 for one person, while low-income is generally defined as making less than $84,850 every year. Moderate income, meanwhile, sits at around $89,550.\nDPP Compass, Sotheby\u2019s International Realty and Mutual Realty Consultants have been charged with marketing the vacant Caltrans properties for sale. How much they fetch on the market remains to be seen.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Ropes &amp; Gray is doubling down on Wacker Drive, handing a win to landlords\nManulife\nand Allianz.\nThe Boston-based law firm renewed its lease at 191 North Wacker Drive and expanded by more than 26,000 square feet, bringing its total to nearly 105,000 at the 37-story office tower, according to an announcement of the deal by commercial real estate brokerage Transwestern.\nThe transaction marks a departure from the recent norm of downsizing in a Chicago office market still reeling from the pandemic, where many tenants are slashing space and landlords are dangling costly concessions to keep them in place and reel in new ones.\nVacancy in the central business district has continued notching record highs this year, fueled by remote and hybrid work patterns and rising sublease inventory, with the rate most recently rising to an average of 27 percent as of July, according to CBRE. Against that backdrop, a blue-chip tenant adding space is a notable win for 734,000-square-foot Wacker Drive tower\u2019s landlord, a joint venture of Manulife and\nAllianz\n.\nThe deal comes after it lured investment firm Neuberger Berman into a 52,000-square-foot lease in a relocation from 190 South LaSalle Street as well as another law firm, Goldman Ismail Tomaselli Brennan &amp; Baum, into an expanded 43,000-square-foot space, both closed earlier this year. Goldman previously rented about 22,000 square feet at\n200 South Wacker\n, which sold earlier this year out of financial distress to investor Patrick Halloran and Chicago-based Glenstar.\n\nAt the time of Neuberger\u2019s lease, 191 North Wacker was 72 percent occupied, meaning the new relocations and Ropes &amp; Gray\u2019s expansion have boosted the property to well above downtown Chicago\u2019s average.\nThe law firm didn\u2019t immediately return requests for additional details about the lease expansion, such as the length of its term.\nIts growth comes as 191 North Wacker is set to unveil a 26,000-square-foot amenity center later this year, the kind of asset that tenants insist on having access to in today\u2019s market as corporate leaders try convincing workers that commuting into offices is worthwhile. The addition will include a tenant lounge, flexible conference facilities, a wellness center and a presentation theater, part of a broader push by landlords to make Class A buildings more competitive as tenants demand high-end perks from their offices.\nRopes &amp; Gray has been a tenant at 191 North Wacker since 2013 and has had a Chicago presence since 2008, when it started with three local partners and rapidly grew its headcount in the city. It began with a sublease of 38,000 square feet in the building 12 years ago.\nCBRE\u2019s Matthew Dobry and Geoffrey Euston represented Ropes &amp; Gray in the recent negotiations, while the landlord\u2019s leasing team included Transwestern\u2019s Katie Steele, Kathleen Bertrand and Eric Myers.\n",

Bilt now has more than 200 employees and plans to create 625 new jobs under the agreement with the Empire State Development Corporation.\nGov. Kathy Hochul said Bilt\u2019s decision to stay in New York \u201cunderscores the unmatched talent, energy, and opportunity that only New York can offer.\u201d\nJain launched Bilt in 2021 and boasts that the company\u2019s network includes one in every four apartment buildings across the country. He said the company was valued at $10.75 billion in July after a $250 million funding round led by General Catalyst and GID.\nThor Equities, Taconic Investment Partners and Square Mile Capital redeveloped 837 Washington Street in 2011 and leased the entire building to Samsung. They sold it to Nuveen, the real estate arm of TIAA-CREF, in 2015 for\n$200 million\n\u2014 setting a record for the Meatpacking District.\n",

Combined with the price of 38 storage lockers and six wine sellers, developers expect to yield more than $380 million.\nPrices released so far start at just below $11 million for a 3,000-square-foot unit with three bedrooms and three bathrooms. The two priciest condos are unit Nos. 20 and 21 asking $48 million and $50 million, respectively. Both feature five bedrooms and five bathrooms and span more than 7,400 square feet. Unit 21 also has 33 square feet of outdoor space.\nThe plan does not yet include pricing for 20 of the residential units, including a 4,600-square-foot penthouse. The four-bedroom unit isn\u2019t the largest offering, though it comes with more than 6,600 square feet of outdoor space \u2014 the most of any unit in the current plan.\nThe developers, the Brodsky Organization and Sorgente Group, earlier this year tapped Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group to\nhead sales at the project\nat 175 Fifth Avenue with a team led by new development veterans Donna Puzio and Angeli DeCecchis.\n\nPuzio previously worked on sales at Related Companies\u2019 Lantern House and Mickey Rabina\u2019s 520 Fifth Avenue, while DeCecchis\u2019 track record includes Related\u2019s 450 Washington and Extell Development\u2019s Central Park Tower.\nSales appear to have started at the building, with Corcoran\u2019s Steve Gold claiming in an\nInstagram post\non Wednesday he brought the buyer who signed the first contract at the conversion.\nGold did not respond to a request for comment on the pending deal.\nA spokesperson for the conversion declined to provide additional details or confirm an official sales launch, though the spokesperson said in September that sales would begin later this year.\nGFP Real Estate\u2019s Jeffrey Gural and a group including Sorgente, ABS Partners and Nathan Silverstein, paid\n$160 million\nfor the Flatiron Building at a 2023 auction, following a failed $190 million bid by an outside investor, Jacob Garlick, who didn\u2019t pay the deposit. Brodsky bought a stake in the project later that year.\nNews of the project\u2019s pricing comes as the city\u2019s new development market is headed for an\ninventory drought\n. Few new buildings are slated to hit the market this year, as developers struggle to land financing while loan and land costs continue to rise.\n",

Bush was in the White House.\nTenants gobbled up 9.4 million square feet \u2014 a 2 percent bump from the second quarter and nearly 27 percent higher than the five-year quarterly average, according to a new Colliers report. Leasing volume surpassed 30 million square feet for the entire year, blowing past pre-Covid levels and marking the strongest period of year-to-date demand since 2002.\nIf the third-quarter pace holds, the year will end north of 40 million square feet \u2014 about 20 percent higher than 2024, per Colliers.

Class B offices posted the biggest jump, up 3.2 percent to $67.83, while Class C space sank to a decade-plus low.\nInvestors are sniffing around again as well. Eleven office buildings traded hands for $1.6 billion in the third quarter, including RXR, Elliott Investment Management and Baupost Group\u2019s\n$1 billion purchase\nof 590 Madison Avenue.\n\u201cThere were continued signs of the Manhattan office market recovering in virtually every measurable way during the third quarter,\u201d said Colliers\u2019 Franklin Wallach. \u201cAlthough the march towards recovery has been building\u2026 the momentum must continue through the end of 2025 and into 2026 for full recovery to be achieved.\u201d\n",

The discount was steep, as the River North office building sold for $75 million in 2015.\nAdding a suburban office specialist could pay off for Colliers if activity picks up in the next few years, or if investors increasingly target distressed suburban products for opportunistic buys.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Houston is heading into fall with a cornucopia of homes.\nAfter passing an all-time inventory milestone, Houston\u2019s single-family listing inventory increased 26 percent year over year in September, pushing 39,000 active listings, according to the Houston Association of Realtors. New listings rose 13 percent to 14,618 homes.\nThis well-stocked September follows an ample August, when Houston had almost 40,000 single-family listings, according to HAR. If you include townhomes and condos,\nHouston had the biggest residential inventory in the country in August\n, setting a record with 44,000 homes overall, per Homes.com.\nAlthough fall is traditionally the start of the slow season, September ended a months-long trend of lagging prices. The median home price in Houston trailed year over year from March to July, and the August average listing price of $443,000 was barely higher than last year\u2019s. The average listing price fell about $3,000 from August to September, but last month\u2019s average of $440,000 was 2 percent higher than a year ago, according to HAR.\n\nHowever, sellers everywhere are lowering prices and offering discounts more than in recent years, and Houston\u2019s at the forefront of the trend. Earlier this year, Houston had the\nlowest sale-to-list ratio of any populous metropolitan area in the country\n, telegraphing negotiating power for buyers.\nHouston and Dallas led the nation in price cuts in August\n, with nearly a third of sellers caving to discounts.\nHarris County ranked fifth among the most-populous counties for annual decreases in median home price, according to ATTOM.\nBuyers are gaining an edge throughout the Sun Belt. After a swift run of accelerating demand, during which builders and sellers enjoyed a rush of in-migration and historically fast home appreciation,\nTexas and Florida\nboomtowns have braked suddenly and tumbled into buyer\u2019s markets.\n",

Because the zoning change is an ordinance, it requires a second reading vote.\nThe zoning change will clear the way for Boca Raton-based SobelCo to build four buildings on what was once a boat yard with a total of 508 condo units, 10,000 square feet of retail, 1,081 parking spaces, and a ninth-floor amenity deck with pools, spas, grilling stations and other features.\nThe condos, which will include 246 one-bedroom units and 262 two-bedroom units, will be marketed to young professionals interested in living near West Palm Beach,\nSobelCo vice president Tirso San Jose\ntold\nThe Real Deal\n. The units will be priced at just under $1 million.\nIt\u2019s planned for a site next to an expanding workforce townhouse project called Villa L\u2019Onz and near Marina Annex, a 175-unit workforce housing project with a 15,000-square-foot community center proposed by a development team led by New York-based\nO\u2019Connor Capital Partners\n.\n\nThe SobelCo development site is also across the street from Marina Village, a 90-acre area adjacent to the Port of Palm Beach that Riviera Beach officials want to redevelop to attract more jobs and revenue. It\u2019s on a portion of Marina Village where the Related Group\u2019s affordable housing arm, Related Urban, recently broke ground to build the\nResidences at Riviera Beach\n, a 149-unit workforce housing project after\nsecuring $100.3 million\nin construction financing. The Related Group, BH Group and Tezral Partners also intend to build\nGallery at Marina Village\n, a 20-story market-rate apartment project, next door.\nThe city also issued a\nnew bid for developers\ninterested in building hotels, restaurants and entertainment on another 12 acres near Marina Village\u2019s marina area.\nFarther north, at 3700 Broadway, developer Peter Baytarian of Forest plans to build\ntwo 25-story mixed-use condo towers\ncalled Oculina.\nAbout a half-dozen residents spoke in favor of the SobelCo project, including former Riviera Beach Councilwoman Julia Botel. Botel said the development will be the first thing people will see when driving over the bridge from West Palm Beach.\n\u201cInstead of vacant lots and underutilized land, people will see new life and new energy and beautiful construction that reflects the promise of Riviera Beach\u2019s future,\u201d Botel said.",

        "content": "A sprawling mansion sold for $11 million in Lake Forest on Wednesday, ending another powerful Midwest business family\u2019s run at the property with an elite history of ownership.\nThe home at 930 East Rosemary Road is the most expensive sale in Lake Forest since 2022, when a Mayflower Road estate brought in nearly $13 million.\nThe eight-bedroom, nine-bathroom house was designed by architect Benjamin H. Marshall in 1912 and expanded in 1996 by Thomas Beeby. It covers 11,800 square feet. The property has a pool, outdoor gardens and a glass-paned indoor conservatory. There is an attached coach house, a guest house and a poolhouse on the estate. The outdoor space features ornate landscaping, gardens and open green spaces.\nThe home was sold by the estate of Posy Krehbiel, who died in 2022. She was the ex-wife of John Krehbiel Jr., who she bought the property with in 1988. John Krehbiel Jr. was the co-chairman of electronics company Molex, which Koch Industries bought in 2013.\nThe home was initially\nlisted in August 2024 at nearly $15 million\n, making the final $11 million price tag around 73 percent of the asking price.\n\nProperty records that could indicate the buyers\u2019 identity are not yet available.\nAnn Lyon with @properties Christies International Real Estate represented the seller. Amanda McCmillan and Andra O\u2019Neill, also with @properties, represented the buyers. They could not be immediately reached for comment.\nThe Krehbiels bought the house in 1988 for $1.95 million. They later expanded the property to include five parcels covering nearly 9 acres. It\u2019s unclear if the latest purchase was for all parcels or if the buyer split off some of them. Krehbiel\u2019s estate paid a little over $126,000 in property taxes on the five parcels in 2025.\nThe house was built in 1912 for John T Pirie, president of Carson Pirie Scott &amp; Co, a dry goods and department store company. It was later owned by Laurance Armour Jr., part of the Armour meat packing family who was the vice chairman of the board at LaSalle Bank.\nThe sale is the latest in a year of success in\nChicago\u2019s luxury market\n. The North Shore has been the site of several home sales that surpassed $10 million.\nA $31.3 million estate in Winnetka\nset the record for the most expensive Chicago area home sale in history in August.\n",

The receiver has been trying to sell the hotels for nearly two years on behalf of Wilmington Trust, a trustee for special servicer Wells Fargo.\nA previous court order set a deadline of July 29 for the sale, though no deal surfaced.

        "content": "Downtown Houston\u2019s latest office development crossed the leasing halfway mark with another headquarters tenant.\nThird Coast Infrastructure leased 20,800 square feet at Norton Rose Fulbright Tower, Skanska USA Commercial Development\u2019s 28-story spec project at 1550 Lamar Street. The Houston-based midstream operator will relocate its headquarters from Hess Tower next year. The lease pushes the building to 62 percent occupied, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe building\u2019s namesake tenant, a law firm, occupies roughly a third of its 375,000 square feet.\nBoston Consulting Group\nand\nHicks Johnson\nare also tenants. The latter moved into its 21,000-square-foot space last month after a $4.3 million build-out.\nThird Coast said it was drawn by the tower\u2019s tech infrastructure, floor-to-ceiling glass and high-end amenities, including landscaped terraces and a 9,600-square-foot amenity center on the 28th floor. Griff Brandy of Partners Real Estate represented Third Coast in the deal.\nThe lease shows momentum for a building that has worked to differentiate itself from Houston\u2019s glut of office supply. Designed by Copenhagen-based\nBjarke Ingels Group\nwith a side-core structure that maximizes natural light, the tower overlooks Discovery Green and recently landed Tenfold Coffee on the ground floor. Chef Hugo Ortega also plans to debut a concept, Zaranda, in the building this year.\n\nIt\u2019s the first new high-rise office tower downtown since Hines\u2019 Texas Tower opened in 2021. Skanska touted the\nproject\nas Houston\u2019s first LEED Platinum, WELL Platinum and WiredScore Platinum pre-certified tower, also targeting Fitwel certification.\nThe headquarters move by Third Coast is a 13-year commitment to a building still carving out its place in a downtown office market defined by high vacancy and landlord giveaways.\nIf momentum holds, Norton Rose Fulbright Tower could help reset leasing comps downtown \u2014 though much of the submarket is stuck with empty space.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Vanbarton Group landed a $280 million loan for Pearl House, its recent Financial District office-to-residential conversion.\nAllianceBernstein provided a $238 senior loan for the 588-unit luxury apartment building at 160 Water Street, according to property records. Brookfield provided $42 million in mezzanine debt.\nThe fresh financing replaces a $277 million loan from Brookfield\u2019s lending arm for the conversion of the 24-story, 533,000-square-foot office building. Eastdil Secured brokered the deal, which was first reported by\nCommercial Observer\n.\nVanbarton, led by Gary Tischler and Richard Coles, purchased the 1970s-era office building in 2014 for $165 million. The developer mulled selling the property, but ultimately decided to undertake the conversion in 2022.\n\nLeasing for the market-rate units\nlaunched in 2023\nand the building was 99 percent occupied within a year, a Vanbarton spokesperson said. When the sales at the Pearl House first launched, rents for studio apartments started at $3,500. One-bedroom units were priced at $4,700, while two-bedroom units started at $6,400. The building has more than 30,000 square feet of amenities, including a bowling alley and a hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber.\nVanbarton has been doing conversions for more than two decades, and its appetite shows no signs of slowing. The firm just bought its third office building in the past year as bargains in the office market, new city and state incentives and demand for new apartments have led to a boom in conversion opportunities.\nThe developer bought\n6 East 43rd Street\nfrom the Milstein family\u2019s Emigrant Savings Bank for $135 million last May and plans to convert it into 441 rental apartments. It\u2019s shelling out about $100 million to buy the home of the Archdiocese of New York at\n1011 First Avenue\n, which it plans to transform into 420 apartments. And late last year, it bought 77 Water Street in the Financial District for\n$95 million\n, which it will turn into 600 units.\n",

Loan proceeds are expected to go towards capital improvements.\nA JLL team including Kevin Davis, Mark Fisher and Jillian Mariutti arranged the loan at the 774-key property.\nBesides Westin\u2019s brand recognition, Smith Hill\u2019s Brendan McCormick pointed to \u201creally attractive supply dynamics\u201d for the hotel market on the East Side of Manhattan as part of the rationale for his firm\u2019s involvement.\nDavidson Kempner acquired the property one block away from Grand Central from seller Host Hotels and Resorts\nfor $302 million\nin 2019. Goldman Sachs provided the firm with $197 million in short-term, floating-rate debt for the deal and Davidson Kempner planned $20 million in renovations; it was the firm\u2019s first purchase of a major hotel in the United States.\n\nIn 2023, Davidson Kempner paid down $63 million in principal from the Goldman Sachs loan and\nsecured a $150 million loan\nfrom Apollo Global Management.\nThe 41-story hotel was developed in 1981 by Harry Helmsley. It included design touches like a red-and-gold carpet and a pair of attached golden H\u2019s mounted over the front desk. Leona Helmsley, the \u201cQueen of Mean,\u201d reportedly lorded over the hotel\u2019s operations and staff.\nHer estate sold the property in 2011\nfor $313.5 million\nto Host Hotels, which closed it for 18 months and spent $75 million to renovate and replace the dated design. Host Hotels repositioned the property and opened it in 2012 under Marriott International\u2019s upper-upscale Westin brand.\nSmith Hill (whose parent company is Procaccianti Companie) and Bain formed a joint venture two years ago to provide capital solutions to hospitality ventures.

The deal includes $10.9 million in upgrades to the rink and $91 million in concession fees over the 20-year term.\nThe nonprofit Conservancy pushed a competing offer to donate $120 million and operate the rink, promising a broader reimagining of the park\u2019s southeast corner.\nBetsy Smith, the group\u2019s president, blasted the city\u2019s decision to maintain \u201can island of for-profit commerce in the middle of Central Park\u201d rather than accept a plan that would have added bathrooms, fixed accessibility issues and created year-round cultural programming.\nInstead, Related will remain in control of the site it was\nfirst tapped\nto manage in 2021, when then-Mayor Bill de Blasio yanked the Trump Organization\u2019s contract after the Jan. 6 riot; Trump bid again for control this time around.\n\nRelated pledged to install a new ice-making system, upgrade mechanical infrastructure and improve stormwater management. A Parks spokesperson said the work wouldn\u2019t disrupt operations.\nThe timing was key: Parks rushed to get the deal before the Franchise Concession Review Committee\u2019s Oct. 16 meeting, ensuring Adams could finalize it before stepping down in December after ending his re-election bid. Had the administration missed that window, the decision would have fallen to his successor. The committee still needs to approve Related\u2019s bid.\nThe move extends Related\u2019s footprint in city-backed projects. In June, Adams\nannounced a deal\nwith the developer to build 4,000 apartments, including 764 permanently affordable units, over the Hudson Yards rail yard, a project buoyed by $2 billion in public funds.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Toronto-based Great Gulf bought the 3-acre waterfront property for\n$28.5 million\nlast year, after completing its 25-story, 83-unit\nLa Clara\ntower in 2023.\nIts latest planned condo, 5400 North Flagler, is slated to replace the Poinsettia Apartments, a two-building multifamily complex spanning three stories and 72 units built in 1966. The property at 5400 North Flagler will include a pool and the developer is considering adding a dock with between four and eight slips, according to the plans presented.\nThe design team includes Moshe Safdie\u2019s Safdie Architects, West Palm Beach-based Spina O\u2019Rourke + Partners, Toronto-based interiors firm Studio Munge, and landscape firm Enea, which is based in Rapperswil-Jona, Switzerland.\nGreat Gulf was founded in 1975 by Harry Rosenbaum, Elly Reisman, Norm Reisman, Larry Robbins and Seymour Joffe, according to reports. It has built more than 80,000 homes across North America, and currently has more than 9,000 units planned or under construction, according to its website. Neil Vohrah is its president of high-rise residential, and is overseeing the 5400 North Flagler project.\n\nIt marks Great Gulf\u2019s second project in the coastal city. It sold out La Clara at 200 Arkona Court for\nmore than $209 million\n.\nBuyers included American Express heiress Stephanie Currey Ingram, Marvel Studios executive Louis D\u2019Esposito, and Jonathan Lerner, whose D.C.-based developer family owns the Washington Nationals. Spec developer Todd Glaser and his partner Jim Randall bought the penthouse unit for\n$18.8 million\n, with the intention to flip it for $28.5 million, but the unit has since been pulled from the market.\nLa Clara\u2019s owners\nfiled a lawsuit against Great Gulf\nin February, alleging the building had construction defects and lacked the luxury finishes buyers were promised.\nIts 5400 North Flagler joins a stacked pipeline of planned condominiums in West Palm Beach, where\nmore than 2,000 units are in development\n. Also in the North Flagler Drive corridor are Related Group and BH Group\u2019s planned 21-story, 39-unit\nApogee\ntower and BGI Capital and Blue Road\u2019s 22-story, 55-unit\nAlba Palm Beach\n, which is nearing completion.\n",

Even so, the number of units under construction in Los Angeles has been in a free fall since early last year, approaching a decade low.\nFewer than 19,000 apartments were under construction in the third quarter, a 30 percent drop from three years ago, per CoStar.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a needle in a haystack to find an opportunity that makes financial sense to build today,\u201d developer Cliff Goldstein told the Times. \u201cA developer without investors would be like a king without clothes. I am an optimistic developer who wants to develop, but the investment community won\u2019t participate.\u201d\nDevelopers have shelved projects and taken their business\nto other municipalities\n.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t bought a site with the intention to develop it in over two years,\u201d Kahan told the outlet. \u201cI don\u2019t know when we will be building in L.A next\u201d\nThe Real Deal\u2019s Building Back L.A.\nroundtable revealed similar sentiments last month.\n\u201cBuyers and sellers are absolutely disgruntled over ULA, and it is not going away.

        "content": "The Nakash family\u2019s woes at its Breakwater hotel in South Beach continue, this time because of a loan default.\nThe debt on the 100-key hotel at 940 and 960 Ocean Drive in Miami Beach entered special servicing after the Nakashes failed to pay off the loan at its maturity last month, marking the third time the financing is in special servicing, according to Morningstar Credit. The owners, through an affiliate, took out the $31.3 million loan in 2014 as a refinancing, with the debt\u2019s balance now at $28.2 million.\nThe\nNakash\nfamily \u2013\u2013 led by brothers Joe, Ralph and Avi Nakash, who are founders of clothing firm Jordache Enterprises and also lead New York-based Nakash Holdings \u2013\u2013 have a portfolio of South Beach hotels that includes the former Versace Mansion and the hotel portion of\nThe Setai Miami Beach\n.\nThe Nakashes, through an affiliate, bought the Breakwater hotel out of bankruptcy in 2008 for $24.8 million, according to records. This amount may be lower than the true price because deeds generally don\u2019t reflect furniture and fixtures usually included in hotel purchases.\nThe Breakwater, completed in 1939 and renovated in 2011, consists of a four-story building at 940 Ocean Drive and a five-story building at 960 Ocean Drive, according to records and Morningstar Credit.\nNakash family members and their representatives didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\nAlthough full-year financials for the hotel haven\u2019t been provided for the past two years, the loan\u2019s debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) has been near or less than the breakeven metric for the majority of the financing\u2019s term, according to Morningstar Credit.\nDSCR is a measurement of whether a property\u2019s cash flow is enough to cover expenses, with a measurement of 1x considered the breakeven. Breakwater\u2019s DSCR was last reported at 0.73x in 2023, according to Morningstar Credit.\nThe loan first experienced trouble in 2020, entering special servicing during the Covid lockdown, according to a June\nKBRA report\n.\nAt the start of the pandemic, tourism and hospitality business halted and hotels suffered a drop in bookings.\nIn 2022, Breakwater\u2019s financing was taken out of special servicing following a forbearance agreement, KBRA\u2019s report says.\n\nBut bigger trouble came, rooted not in bookings and revenue but in a legal dispute between the Nakashes and Ocean\u2019s Ten, a restaurant tenant at the hotel owned by Catherine and Anthony Arrighi.\nOcean\u2019s Ten had first sued the Nakashes\u2019 Breakwater ownership entity in 2020, alleging the landlord was trying to illegally evict the restaurant. The Nakashes responded with a countersuit, arguing in part that the restaurant was violating noise ordinances and the lease due to loud noise, and also sued to evict Ocean\u2019s Ten.\nIn 2022, Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Valerie Manno Schurr entered a scathing order for\n$17.4 million\nin punitive damages and $2.1 million in attorney fees against the Nakashes. The ruling was based on the determination that the Nakash family enterprise submitted fabricated evidence in the case, lied under oath, filed a false expert report to the court and lied to Miami Beach city officials and special magistrates, according to the order. The owners had allegedly hired a private investigator to pose as a hotel guest and made up sham noise complaints about the restaurant.\nThe hotel\u2019s loan went into special servicing for a second time in 2022 due to the judge\u2019s order, according to the KBRA report.\nMost recently, the Nakashes got some good news in the case. In January, an appeals court agreed with the family and struck down the $17.4 million punitive damages award to the restaurant, court filings show. The appeals panel of judges determined Ocean\u2019s Ten failed to establish \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d it\u2019s entitled to punitive damages.\nThe appeals court still upheld the lower court\u2019s decision to strike the Nakashes\u2019 push to evict Ocean\u2019s Ten, and its order for sanctions against the Nakahses.\nIn the meantime, the hotel\u2019s loan matured in September of last year but a forbearance agreement between the lender and Nakashes pushed back the maturity to September of this year, according to Morningstar Credit. Last month\u2019s default marked the third time the debt goes to special servicing.\nIt\u2019s unclear who is the Nakahses\u2019 lender on the Breakwater. Their ownership entity, 940 Ocean Drive, and Nakash Holdings recorded no mortgage on the property since 2008 in public records.\nMorningstar Credit lists the lender as Pillar, though several financiers with variations of this name exist.\nIn South Beach, the Nakashes own Hotel Victor at 1144 Ocean Drive, Hotel Ocean at 1236 Ocean Drive and the commercial space at The Strand at 1052 Ocean Drive. In 2023, a Nakash affiliate and its partner VE Group paid\n$23.5 million\nfor the 80-room, five-story Beacon South Beach Hotel building at 720 Ocean Drive, also in South Beach.\nThe family bought the former Versace Mansion, home of the late fashion designer Gianni Versace, out of bankruptcy in 2013 for\n$41.5 million\n. The property at 1116 Ocean Drive has been converted into a hotel and the name The Villa Casa Casuarina.\n",

The city paid $13.5 million for the site, which it has leased for years.\nBXP\nlisted the property in May\nafter its plans for a proposed tech campus fell apart. The company, formerly known as Boston Properties, had owned the land since 2000, paying $35 million for multiple parcels from the city\u2019s Redevelopment Agency. BXP hoped to build two 16-story towers with 1.4 million square feet of office space, 37,600 square feet of retail, plus amenity space and underground parking. As\noffice space demand\ndropped after the pandemic, BXP gave up on those plans.\nThe site is across the street from the San Jose Convention Center and behind the Children\u2019s Discovery Museum and Discovery Meadow. The parking lot is a reliable revenue generator for the city, but it could be transformed into a critical piece of downtown San Jose\u2019s activity.\n\n\u201cSecuring this property will provide greater flexibility for the city as we consider a range of possibilities, including potential\nconvention center expansion\nor other sports and entertainment district uses such as a flagship hotel, retail, restaurants, arts and cultural venues, or other gathering spaces,\u201d Kevin Ice, the city\u2019s director of real estate, told the outlet.\nThe City of San Jose will use its commercial paper program to issue notes for short-term borrowing. Then it will use parking revenue and convention center funds to pay back the notes. Including financing costs, the acquisition is estimated to cost $15.7 million.\nCity officials are bullish on the idea of creating mixed-use districts around major sports venues. The city recently signed a deal with the\nNHL\n\u2019s San Jose Sharks to keep the team in the city until 2051 and to renovate their SAP Center arena a few blocks away from the 447 South Almaden site.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The company plans to move by the end of the year. The Carrollton hub will bring 1,800 new jobs.\nThe four-story office building, constructed in 2019, has a gym, cafe and patio. Pharmaceutical company AmerisourceBergen put the building on the sublease market nearly two years ago, CoStar\nreported\n. It was the area\u2019s second-largest office sublease at the time.\nPennyMac\nleased nearly 76,000 square feet\nat the Plano Corporate Center East building, at 2201 West Plano Parkway, in 2016. The property was formerly the campus for FedEx Office.\n\nNews of the Carrollton hub comes as\nPennyMac enters a subservicing relationship with Annaly Capital Management\n, the world\u2019s largest residential mortgage REIT. Per the agreement, Annaly is acquiring a portfolio of PennyMac\u2019s mortgage servicing rights; PennyMac will manage the loans.\nAs the Metroplex sprawls, companies are becoming more interested in\nestablishing offices in suburbs\n, closer to where employees live. The trend has translated to increased office leasing activity in spots like Carrollton, Plano and Frisco.\nFor example, Simpson Strong-Tie Company, a California-based manufacturer of construction fasteners and connectors,\nsigned a deal\nat Plano\u2019s Granite Park 6, which was delivered in 2023 and is now 58 percent occupied. It\u2019s leasing 38,000 square feet. Similarly, Sally Beauty is\nrelocating from its longtime headquarters\nin Denton to a 140,000-square-foot spot at 7900 Windrose Avenue in Plano\u2019s Legacy West.\nWhile office vacancy is elevated at 25.2 percent, levels in these submarkets are faring much better, with vacancy rates in the high teens and low twenties, according to Avison Young.\n",

        "content": "Illinois\u2019 controversial method of seizing properties over unpaid taxes is on thinner ice after a federal judge allowed a class-action lawsuit to move forward, raising the prospect that counties could owe millions to former property owners.\nU.S. District Judge Nancy J. Rosenstengel of the Southern District of Illinois denied an effort by treasurers from five counties to\ntoss the case\n, in a Sept. 30 opinion. The lawsuit, brought by property owners including Top Metal Buyers Inc., challenges Illinois\u2019 practice of stripping owners of all equity in a property once it is lost in a tax deed sale, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe opinion is among the first from a judge to explicitly say counties could be on the hook for violating constitutional protections.\nThe backdrop is the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2023 decision in Tyler v. Hennepin County, which found that keeping more than what\u2019s owed in taxes amounts to an unconstitutional taking. In that case, a Minnesota woman lost a $40,000 home over $15,000 in back taxes \u2014 and the Court ruled she was owed the $25,000 difference.\nIllinois\nis the lone state among the 14 with similar systems that has yet to reform its laws. A push in Springfield\nfizzled this year\n, and Cook County Treasurer Maria Pappas has punted the county\u2019s tax sales until next year, saying she wants time to pursue reforms. Other counties, however, pressed ahead with sales \u2014 and now face potential liability.\n\nIn one example cited in the lawsuit, St. Clair County recouped $44,000 in unpaid taxes on an East St. Louis property worth $102,000, wiping out $58,000 in equity. Another plaintiff lost more than $100,000 in value when his home was sold over a $10,000 bill. The suit calls the practice \u201cinstitutionalized theft.\u201d\nCounty treasurers argue they were following state law and that third-party tax buyers \u2014 the investors who swoop in on delinquent properties \u2014 should bear responsibility for lost equity. Rosenstengel disagreed, writing that the constitutional violation stems from counties\u2019 failure to compensate owners for the surplus value.\nThe opinion doesn\u2019t resolve the case, but it heightens the risk that counties will ultimately be forced to reimburse former owners. The state already dominates national rankings for property tax\nburdens\nwith four of the five highest-taxing metro areas in the country.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Staff will draft documents for a preliminary rezoning approval, moving the project from industrial to residential.\nThe proposal, from Chicago-based Habitat Company on behalf of Red Cup Land Company, would create a 48-building community anchored by a clubhouse, walking trail and nine acres of green space. Thirty-four units would be reserved for households earning the area\u2019s median income under\nHighland Park\u2019s\ninclusionary housing rules.\nIf approved, construction could begin this spring and take up to two years, said Habitat vice president Zack Zalar. Before starting construction, the developer must clear another round of engineering reviews, satisfy environmental regulators about potential industrial contamination and answer lingering questions about density and traffic.\nThis hasn\u2019t been an easy win.\n\nMonday\u2019s four-hour meeting drew more than 50 attendees, echoing six prior hearings before the city\u2019s Plan and Design Commission, which narrowly recommended approval last month after 17 hours of deliberations. Some residents oppose the project\u2019s bulk and impact on traffic.\nHabitat\nhas already scaled the project down from an initial 262 homes, but Zalar said the developer won\u2019t cut further. The city is pressing instead for refinements: accessible trails, EV chargers, assurances that construction will be completed even if delays emerge, and a second traffic study once the homes are occupied.\nThe site has a contentious backstory. A 500-unit complex from\nInterforum Holdings\npitched in 2018 went nowhere, and a subsequent plan for a 300,000-square-foot warehouse complex from\nRed Cup Land Company\nalso failed to win city approval. That history weighed on Monday\u2019s debate, with several officials warning that rejecting Habitat\u2019s proposal could open the door to less palatable options.\nCouncil member Andr\u00e9s Tapia said that while the plan isn\u2019t perfect, it may strike the best balance between growth pressures and community concerns. The council will take up preliminary approval at a future meeting, with final consideration likely by end of year.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "More than $100 million in public incentives for a sweeping redevelopment of\nBank of America\nPlaza moved past two gatekeepers last week.\nCity advisory boards approved subsidies for the 72-story tower that dominates the city\u2019s skyline, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The $409 million redevelopment proposal, pitched by developers Mike Ablon of PegasusAblon and Mike Hoque of Hoque Global, would convert portions of the nearly 2 million-square-foot building at 901 Main Street into a hotel with event and retail space, plus a parking garage.\nThe vision is to stitch the project into the broader downtown core with elevated pedestrian connections. The developer are under contract to buy the\n1980s-era tower\n.\nThe Downtown Dallas Development Authority and the Downtown Connection Tax Increment Financing District both signed off on boosting their combined subsidy from $98 million to $103 million. The bump covers the cost of designing a new garage to support 200 residential units or hotel rooms stacked above it. The boards also approved expanding the geographic boundaries of the TIF district to capture a parcel that\u2019s part of the project at 901 Main Street.\nHoque\nand Ablon, through an entity called 901 Main PAHG Partners, struck a deal last year to buy the\n1.9 million-square-foot tower\nfrom Chicago-based Metropolis Holdings. The price wasn\u2019t disclosed. The Dallas Central Appraisal District valued the 1.85 million-square-foot tower at $130 million, or $70 per square foot.\n\nAblon framed the redevelopment as a lifeline for a central business district that has been losing traction with big-name tenants. The tower, nicknamed \u201cThe Pickle\u201d for its green nighttime glow, is about 70 percent leased and is losing its anchor tenant to\nUptown\n. AT&amp;T is also rumored to be reevaluating its headquarters footprint nearby, raising the stakes for a downtown revival.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not catalytic if you just put lipstick on a building,\u201d Ablon told the boards. \u201cWe have to change the playing field.\u201d\nUnder terms of the deal, PegasusAblon must close on the tower by next September and deliver the project by fall 2032 to keep the incentives in play. The sale was originally projected to close later this year. The package now heads to City Council for a vote Oct. 22.\nIf it clears, the deal would mark one of the largest city-backed downtown overhauls in years.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "There were 219 transactions totaling $259 million recorded in New York City over the 24 hours before 4:00 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 2.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Residential:\nThe priciest residential deal recorded in New York City was on the Upper East Side.\nEric Scuderi\n, a financier, and\nNatalia Wolff\ndropped $7.6 million on a co-op at\n770 Park Avenue\n. The seller was the estate of\nPatricia Klingenstein\n, a philanthropist who purchased the pad in 2012 for just under $10 million. Patricia was married to John Klingenstein, the son of investment banker Joseph Klingenstein who was among the founders of Mount Sinai\u2019s School of Medicine. The four-bedroom co-op comes with a storage rtoom and has two fireplaces and a library. Brown Harris Stevens\u2019\nAmanda Brainerd\nand\nGerartd Ryan\nhad the listing, which went live in January 2024 for a hair under $9 million.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nThe estate of\nVera Jaqueline Winsor\n, a Canadian-born sculptor, parted with a co-op at\n112 Mercer Street\nin Soho for just under $5 million. Winsor, whose work is in the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, had lived and worked in the full-floor loft since the 1960s. The buyer was\nAbby Caulkins\n, an art dealer. The unit spans about 3,000 square feet and has an additional 300 square feet of terrace space. The loft\u2019s monthly maintenance is just $200, as the co-op\u2019s shareholders receive income from the building\u2019s ground-floor retail tenant, Frankies Bikinis. The estate had put the loft on the market in June for $4.8 million. The listing agents were Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s\nGlenn Norrgard\nand\nSamantha Sitinas.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nAnother Soho artist\u2019s loft is off the market, this time for $4.3 million. The seller was the family of the late\nIda Applebroog\n, an artist whose work is in the Whitney, the Met, the MoMa and the Guggenheim Museum. The unit, the full eighth floor of\n491 Broadway\n, in the Cast Iron Historic District, spans about 4,000 square feet and is all open space. However, it can be renovated to accommodate three bedrooms and three bathrooms, according to the listing. A Compass team led by\nHenry Hershkowitz\nrepresented the sellers. The buyers were\nDonald and Liutauras Van Hook.\nBy the Numbers:\nWhere are new offices being built?\n\nDespite a sharp two-year drop in construction starts, builders haven\u2019t hit the brakes on office development entirely.\nNearly one-half of a percent of the nation\u2019s office stock is under construction, according to real estate data platform\nYardi Matrix\u2019s September report\n, which excluded properties set to be occupied by their owners. That\u2019s more than 40.2 million square feet of space.\nAustin is the major market that has the greatest share of its office stock under construction, with 2.5 percent, or 2.4 million square feet. Miami and Boston follow, with 2.2 percent of their space in the midst of being built.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "There\u2019s a mystery surrounding a controversial development site in Crown Heights.\nWill Yitzchok Schwartz, who\njust bought\n962-972 Franklin Avenue from Ian Bruce Eichner, build the mixed-income rental project that Eichner fought so hard to get approved for that site?\nOr will Schwartz build 100 percent market-rate condominiums, as he is doing next door at 960 Franklin Avenue?\nEichner once controlled both sites and sought to rezone them for a huge multifamily development with lots of affordable units, but was denied because it would have cast shadows on the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.\nThat killed his contract to buy 960 Franklin, which Schwartz later bought. Eichner did get a rezoning for the other half of the site, 962-972 Franklin, but the City Council shrank his project and attached some strings.\nUpon selling the land to Schwartz, Eichner issued a\ncryptic statement\n:\n\u201cWe sought approval for a project with height and density that should have been approved, namely, a union-built, union pension fund\u2013financed rental project with substantial affordability. Instead,\nBBG\nis getting what it wanted: non-union built, 100 percent market-rate condominiums in an already gentrified neighborhood \u2014 a tragedy for Crown Heights.\u201d\nDoes Eichner know what Schwartz would build at 972 Franklin? Or was he just venting? Neither man is talking. So I went to an impartial source to see what Schwartz\u2019s options are.\n\u201cIt was rezoned to MIH so there is an affordability requirement,\u201d said Wilson Parry of PropertyScout, referring to Mandatory Inclusionary Housing. \u201cSchwartz cannot evade this. He has to fulfill it either on-site or off-site.\u201d\nIf Schwartz puts the affordable units somewhere else, they must be nearby (see map), and he must build more of them \u2014 say, 35 percent of total units must be affordable instead of 30 percent.\nHe can choose from\nMIH options 1, 2 or 4\n. Eichner was targeting Option 4, aka workforce housing. That would allow market-rate units on 70 percent of the floor area.\nThe other 30 percent would have to be affordable at a weighted average of 115 percent of area median income, including 5 percent affordable at 90 percent of AMI and 5 percent affordable at 70 percent of AMI. No affordable band can be above 135 percent of AMI.\nIs your head spinning yet? There\u2019s more: At least 65 percent of the floors must have affordable units, half of which must have two or more bedrooms, and no more than 25 percent can be studios.\nThe bedroom mix must be the same as for the market-rate units. Progressives often say the government should stay out of people\u2019s bedrooms. But not when it comes to development, apparently.\nSchwartz\u2019s site offers 300,000 buildable square feet and a height limit of 125 feet. (City of Yes added 10 feet to the maximum height.)\n\nEichner clearly resents that the city fought his plans for the better part of a decade. But his statement\u2019s implication that Schwartz would build only market-rate condos was misleading.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nHow come shade from trees is nice, but from buildings is bad? The common argument that a proposed project would cast harmful shadows has never resonated with me. When I took my kids to parks and playgrounds, which was nearly every day, I tried to keep them out of the sun as much as possible. Sun or shade had no impact on their enjoyment, except on hot days, in which case they preferred shade. Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The Ahi Ezer project that\novercame\n\u201cmember deference\u201d was the first to benefit from the Adams administration\u2019s\nGreen Fast Track\n, which speeds up the administrative process before the public review for small and mid-size projects that use electricity for heat and hot water.\nElsewhere\u2026\nBuildings expert Henry Gifford has a theory about what caused the\nexplosion and partial building collapse\nat NYCHA\u2019s Mitchell Houses in the Bronx on the first day of heating season, Oct. 1.\nHe explained that if an oil boiler is not tuned up, soot can accumulate and burn if too much air is added to the flame. Some of the soot will burn off and some will turn into gas, mostly methane, and fill the chimney. If a burning ember from the soot makes its way into the shaft and ignites the gas \u2026 BOOM!\n\u201cThe likelihood of an investigator figuring this out, or even pursuing this line of investigation, is, I think, very slim,\u201d Gifford said.\nOne fact that may undercut his theory: the boilers in the building were gas, which burns more cleanly than oil.\nThe Housing Authority is not speculating on the cause, which is under investigation, but said in a statement, \u201cNYCHA\u2019s heating technicians check and monitor all heating plants daily and perform regular maintenance throughout the year.\u201d\nThe ventilation shaft that fell apart at 205 Alexander Avenue was not part of the 59-year-old building\u2019s structure, which is why the rest of the building appeared unaffected by the collapse, one observer noted in a\nYouTube video\n.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$4.2 million\nfor Unit 4C at 181 MacDougal Street in Greenwich Village. The unit, in a new condominium, is 1,300 square feet.\nCorcoran Sunshine Marketing Group\u2019s\nJames Weiss has the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$3.7 million\nfor 37-31 29th Street in Long Island City. The commercial building is 4,300 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $28.5 million for 123 East 73rd Street. The Lenox Hill townhome is 11,100 square feet and listed by\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s\nEpo Manning and Florence Danforth-Meyer.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

        "content": "Last month, I got a call from a broker who sells rent-stabilized buildings. It\u2019s been a brutal six years for people like him. And he needed to vent.\n\u201cI cannot believe how bad the environment in New York is,\u201d he began. \u201cAlmost every building is underwater.\u201d\nHe was talking about rent-stabilized buildings without enough free-market rentals to offset the\neffects\nof the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019.\nThe broker was so worked up, he hardly knew where to begin. But he had to start somewhere. Selling buildings with rent-stabilized units, he said, is now like traversing a minefield.\n\u201cThe due diligence is impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the paperwork from 15 years ago when you deregulated a unit, when the rent was $900, and now you\u2019re charging $6,000\u2026\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t need to finish the sentence, because rent-stabilized owners know exactly what he\u2019s talking about: the risk of having to pay a tenant years\u2019 worth of \u201c\novercharges\n\u201d because they can\u2019t document renovations that removed a unit from stabilization, back when that was allowed.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have [the documents], and you end up going to court with a tenant, you lose,\u201d he said.\nThe records must be precise about what renovations were done to each unit and the cost. An invoice from a contractor without those specifics doesn\u2019t cut it. Landlords better have saved the canceled check, too.\n\u201cBanks get rid of their records after seven years,\u201d the broker lamented.\nNo record-retention law existed, so not all landlords kept the paperwork. But years later, new laws and court rulings required it. Without the benefit of a time machine, some landlords are vulnerable to\nrent-overcharge lawsuits\n.\nIf a unit\u2019s deregulation is reversed retroactively, the owner must reimburse the tenant for the difference between the \u201clegal rent\u201d (had the unit remained stabilized) and what the tenant has been paying. If the action is deemed to be\nfraud\n, the payback triples.\n\u201cOne unit with\ntreble damages\ncan be more than $200,000,\u201d the broker said. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer an asset, it\u2019s a liability.\u201d\nI asked what metric best captures the devaluation of rent-stabilized buildings. Gross rent multiplier, he said. Multiplying that figure by the rent roll produces the expected sale price.\n\u201cDepending on the building and location, it can be anywhere from 4 to 6.5 times the rent roll,\u201d he said. \u201cIt used to be 14 to 18 times the rent roll.\u201d\nHe paused to let that sink in.\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking values dropping 75 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine if your stock portfolio dropped 75 percent in five years.\u201d\nHe could not understand why the New York Times and other major media outlets are not writing about this. I pointed out that the Times virtually stopped covering commercial real estate in the city when reporter\nCharles Bagli\nleft the staff in 2018.\nThe broker recalled urging owners to sell their rent-stabilized buildings in the early part of this decade, as the city rebounded from the pandemic. But owners were still shell-shocked by the 2019 rent law and figured the state legislature would fix it.\n\nBig mistake.\n\u201cThe prices just keep coming down,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have come down every day since June of 2019.\nEvery day.\n\u201d\nHe pointed to a building with a $1 million rent roll now worth about $5 million. \u201cI could have sold that five years ago for $10 million \u2014 during Covid!\u201d the broker said. \u201cAnd people just did nothing.\u201d\nAnother client bought a Bronx building in 2018 and got a $33 million mortgage. Today, the owner thinks the property is worth $13 million.\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t paid the loan in months, and the bank hasn\u2019t even put him in default yet,\u201d the broker said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want it. No one wants these buildings!\u201d\nActually, some investors are looking to buy \u2014 at steep discounts. Yet owners sometimes overplay their hands.\n\u201cBuyers are able to get financing, but I wish sellers really understood how difficult it is to get a deal done. They overnegotiate sometimes,\u201d the broker said.\nEven if largely ignored by major media outlets, the plight of rent-stabilized housing \u2014 which is nearly a third of the city\u2019s housing stock \u2014 has become increasingly apparent. Yet the state legislature has shown no urgency to address the issue, passing only a\nnearly useless tweak\nto the individual apartment improvements program.\n\u201cThere is nothing on the horizon that indicates any type of rent reform is near,\u201d the broker said.\nIf anything, he sees things getting worse, with Assembly member Zohran Mamdani expected to win the mayoral race on a\nfreeze-the-rent\ncampaign.\n\u201cMamdani, he\u2019s got Cea Weaver [advising his housing agenda]. What? These are all activists!\u201d he said. \u201cThe real estate industry is not waking up to this reality.\u201d\nWeaver has called private property \u201c\na weapon of white supremacy\n.\u201d\nNow, City Council members are trying to pass the\nCommunity Opportunity to Purchase Act\n. COPA is a version of the state bill TOPA, or Tenants Opportunity to Purchase Act. Both would pause multifamily sales for months to give tenants a chance to buy their buildings.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a disaster,\u201d the broker said. \u201cI think prices will go down another 10 percent if and when that happens.\u201d\nValues are falling so fast, he said, that \u201cif you have to wait six months [to sell], it could cost you a million dollars.\u201d\nTo him, TOPA and COPA are part of tenant activists\u2019 agenda to\nsocialize rent-stabilized buildings\n\u2014 to wrest them from their owners.\n\u201cThey are trying to take back the housing, and they are not hiding from this,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first step is devaluing it. Check. The next step is making it impossible to run a profit. Check. The next step is [giving tenants] a first or last right of first refusal.\n\u201cMy clients say, \u2018It cannot get worse.\u2019 Well, what about this?\u201d\n",

The 18,963-square-foot mansion sits on a 1.2-acre point lot with a pool, hot tub, outdoor kitchen and dock.\nThe property\nwent under contract\nin September. It\u2019s on the market with Eddy Martinez and Roland Ortiz of One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. The purchase price is unknown.\nLempera, the former president of Future Environmental, sold his company to Patrick Dovigi\u2019s waste management giant GFL Environmental in 2018. The following year, he paid $25.5 million for the Gables Estates property at auction. The mansion was completed in 2018.\nTesfaye was in the market for a waterfront mansion in this price range and neighborhood, sources said. The deal marks his first publicly known real estate purchase in South Florida.\nIn 2021, he\npaid $70 million\nfor a mansion in Bel Air, marking the priciest residential deal in Los Angeles that year.\n\nGables Estates was recently named the most expensive neighborhood in the U.S., topping Beverly Hills, according to Zillow.\nIn late August, attorney Anthony Lopez and his fianc\u00e9e, former \u201cReal Housewives of Miami\u201d star, Dr. Nicole Martin,\nbought the waterfront mansion\nat 33 Arvida Parkway in the same Coral Gables neighborhood following their recent sale of a nearby estate. The couple paid $34 million for the property, which was on the market for $47 million.\nOne community away in Old Cutler Bay, Lopez and Martin sold the 19,380-square-foot, seven-bedroom home at 555 Reinante Avenue\nfor $40 million\nto English singer-songwriter Robbie Williams.\nTesfaye, known for hits that include \u201cBlinding Lights\u201d and \u201cCan\u2019t Feel My Face,\u201d won\u2019t be the only celebrity musician in Gables Estates.

Three years later, the Bay Area developer changed course, submitting another proposal for an advanced manufacturing site. It never started construction.\nLBA submitted a development permit to the city of San Jose earlier this year to build a 207,950-square-foot data center on the site. Goodman Group is known for developing, owning and managing logistics and data centers in cities around the globe.\nProperties next door are owned by Microsoft. LBA Realty sold off two adjacent sites to the tech giant in 2021 and 2023. Microsoft paid a combined $84.3 million for them, the Mercury News\nreported\n.\n\nMicrosoft is charging full steam ahead with its embrace of artificial intelligence, and itproposed building two data centers spanning 300,000 square feet on the adjacent parcels along Orchard Parkway. The construction permit for those projects have since expired without shovels hitting dirt. Earlier this year, the company\nannounced it would spend $80 billion\nto build data centers this year.\nMeanwhile, another data center is headed toward construction in downtown San Jose.\nVancouver, Canada-based developer Westbank submitted a proposal to the city\u2019s Planning Department in August to build 391 housing units next to a data center at 180 Park Avenue as part of Westbank\u2019s Park Habitat development. That data center is meant to\nbenefit Pacific Gas &amp; Electric\nby capturing the excess heat from the facility to provide low-cost, low-carbon energy to nearby residents.\nThe booming AI sector has been helping revitalize the Bay Area\u2019s office market after years of post-pandemic doldrums,\nparticularly in San Francisco\n. More than 50,000 new employees are expected to flock to the region over the next five years,\naccording\nto CBRE\u2019s estimates.\nThe South Bay and Peninsula are\nsimilarly attracting AI tenants\n. As AI grows, so too does the need for data centers, so it\u2019s likely more will continue to pop up in the Bay Area in the coming years.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Village Homes, a longtime Fort Worth homebuilder, filed for bankruptcy this week as it battles Dallas-based developer Olerio Homes over a collapsed land and branding deal.\nThe filing allows the company to keep building while it works through the dispute, according to a news release. The legal fight stems from a proposed sale last year of 100 vacant lots and the Village Homes name, part of a rebrand and retirement plan for one of the firm\u2019s founders, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram\nreported\n.\nVillage claims Olerio failed to secure financing and backed out after putting down $300,000.\nOlerio alleges the builder wrongly killed the deal, suing in Tarrant County for damages and control of the lots. In May, Olerio won an order blocking Village from selling the land; an August bid by Village to overturn the order was denied, court records show.\n\u201cThis is not a decision we take lightly,\u201d Village co-founder and president Michael Dike said, adding the company intends to keep paying employees, vendors and lenders. He framed the\nbankruptcy\nas a way to restructure and \u201ccome through this process intact.\u201d In the statement, Dike also said the filing is not lender-driven.\n\nSince launching in 1996, Village has delivered more than 1,500 homes across\nFort Worth\n, including projects in\nWalsh Ranch\nand Linwood, and is currently building luxury townhomes in Stonegate. Their product line ranges from custom single-family homes to condos and townhomes with pricepoints from $290,000 to upwards of $2 million.\nOlerio has been active in\nDallas luxury homebuilding\nand custom projects.\nThe standoff leaves Village\u2019s development pipeline tied up, its branding in limbo, and a Fort Worth company forced into bankruptcy court to preserve business as usual.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "An apartment complex for senior citizens is headed for construction thanks to\nbuilder\u2019s remedy\n.\nLaguna Hills City Council members voted to approve the project at the La Paz Village shopping center, Voice of OC\nreported\n. The project applicant is Nick Buchanan of Cape Point Development, which\nbought\nLa Paz Village in 2022 for $23.5 million.\nThe project is expected to replace some retail spaces in the mall with 180 studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments for tenants ages 55 and up. Of the units slated for construction, 10 percent of them, or 18 total, are set aside for very-low-income residents. In Orange County, very-low-income generally\nfalls under\nannual incomes of $59,250 or less for one person. For two people, the maximum annual income must not exceed $67,700.\nIn addition to the apartments, the 61-foot-tall project would include activity areas, a theater, gym, pool, salon and community courtyards.\nWhile the City Council voted 3-1 in favor of the development, the officials who approved the project said they felt their hand was forced thanks in part to builder\u2019s remedy and other state-level laws.\n\n\u201cYour concerns about this project\u2019s density, the height, the potential strain on traffic and resources, they\u2019re not just valid, but they\u2019re the same worries that keep me up at night,\u201d Mayor Joshua Sweeney said, per Voice of OC. \u201cBut here\u2019s the painful truth that we must face together as a community: The state of California, through Sacramento\u2019s relentless push of laws like the Housing Accountability Act,\nAB 1893\nand now\nAB 130\n, which was the final nail in the coffin, has systematically stripped away all our local control, and they have tied our hands in a way that feels profoundly unfair, leaving us in checkmate.\u201d\nBecause the concept of builder\u2019s remedy is part of California\u2019s Housing Accountability Act, cities aren\u2019t allowed to deny builder\u2019s remedy projects just because they don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a good fit for their communities or are concerned about density or parking issues. As a result, denying a builder\u2019s remedy project would open the door to lawsuits from groups including affordable housing organizations and the California attorney general.\nSweeney said the project \u201cclashes with the community\u2019s heart and soul\u201d but also believes it isn\u2019t worth it to risk being sued by denying it.\n\u201cIf we fight it outright, we\u2019d invite lawsuits from the attorney general, advocacy groups and many others, and we simply cannot risk bankrupting Laguna Hills and draining our city\u2019s funds,\u201d he said. Councilmember Dave Wheeler echoed that sentiment, calling the proposal a \u201cmonstrosity\u201d before voting to approve it.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The Maxal Group is behind the project, its latest Hudson-front play following the 236-unit Harbor 1500 in Weehawken.\nWhen fully built, the development is slated to bring more than 1,200 units, a 2.5-acre public waterfront park and a new ferry terminal with direct service to Manhattan\u2019s West Side. That last piece is crucial: the promised 15-minute ride to Hudson Yards is the kind of transit amenity lenders say makes Edgewater more than just spillover from New York.\nDesigned by FXCollaborative with interiors from CetraRuddy, the rental project will sport a glass-and-corrugated fa\u00e7ade nodding to the Palisades, plus 25,000 square feet of amenities from golf simulator to spa. Units are geared toward professionals and families priced out of Manhattan, with layouts catering to remote work.\nFor Maxal, led by Bruce Sturman, 615 River Road is positioned as a step up in Edgewater\u2019s luxury pipeline, offering floor-to-ceiling glass with skyline views and proximity to retail heavyweights like Whole Foods and Trader Joe\u2019s.\n\nGalaxy Capital brokered the financing.\nEdgewater\u2019s planning board\napproved the project\nin 2021. The developers had been entangled in a legal battle involving the project\u2019s affordable housing since July 2015, leading to a settlement two years later.\nS3, one of the nation\u2019s most active private lenders, framed the deal as part of a strategy to back \u201ctransit-oriented residential developments adjacent to major city centers.\u201d\nS3\u2019s Steven Jemal, who led the financing, said the project\u2019s ferry terminal would be a \u201clasting value\u201d for the town, while S3 co-founder Robert Schwartz cast it as another example of the firm\u2019s ability to underwrite and deploy capital quickly.\n",

Units in the project will span between two- to four-bedrooms and range from 1,500 square feet to 4,200 square feet. Prices start at $2 million. Amenities will include a 13,000-square-foot fitness center, a juice bar, two pools, spa facilities and a Japanese onsen, the release shows.

        "content": "A trust tied to the billionaire Bezos family is seeking approval from Coral Gables to upgrade the dock behind their prime Gables Estates compound.\nCompanies tied to the Bezos Family Foundation acquired two adjacent waterfront mansions in 2022 for a combined $78 million. The LLCs were linked to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos\u2019 late mother, Jackie, and his stepfather, Mike. They\npaid $44 million\nfor the 8,713-square-foot home at 9501 Journeys End Lane and\n$34 million\nfor the 12,829-square-foot mansion at 9475 Journeys End Road.\nThe properties total just over four acres in the gated Coral Gables community.\nForgotten Fountain LLC submitted an application to the city for variances that will allow a boatlift to extend 54 feet and two inches, more than twice as far as currently allowed;\u00a0 as well as a variance to allow mooring piles to be set 67 feet and four inches, nearly three times as far out from the banks of the waterways. The city\u2019s board of adjustment will review the variance requests at its meeting on Monday. The board of architects approved the requests in July.\nThe existing dock will remain, according to the application. The boatlift and mooring piles can\u2019t be located closer to the shoreline because of the mangrove trees, a protected plant.\n\nThe application includes an approval from the Journey\u2019s End Homeowners Association, signed by president Louis Wolfson III.\nBezos\u2019 mother, Jackie, died in August at the age of 78. Jackie and Mike owned a home in Miami\u2019s Palmetto Bay until 1984, two years after\nJeff\ngraduated from Miami Palmetto Senior High School.\nMike Bezos is reportedly planning a \u201cmajor expansion\u201d of his family office, the\nWall Street Journal\nreported in September. The office, called Aurora Borealis, recently hired Valeria Alberola as CEO.\nJeff, whose net worth is about $235 billion, has\nacquired waterfront properties\nin the exclusive village of Indian Creek, also home to Jared and Ivanka Trump, Tom Brady, Jeff Soffer and Carl Icahn. He\u2019s building a waterfront estate on the island.\n",

        "content": "A Market Street office building has sold for less than half of its pre-pandemic value.\nFountainhead Development swooped in to buy the historic 800 Market Street building, dubbed by locals as the \u201cFlatiron Building,\u201d for $17.2 million, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. The seller was\nInvesco\n, which acquired the property in 2011 for $51 million, putting the current deal\u00a0 at a 60 percent drop in value.\nThe sale price comes to about $354 per square foot, compared with $1,100 or so more than a decade ago,\naccording\nto the San Francisco Business Times. The transaction marks the second San Francisco deal for Fairbanks, Alaska-based Fountainhead after buying 795 Folsom Street last year for $48.3 million.\nThe building is across the street from\nSan Francisco Centre\n, the beleaguered mall that has been bleeding tenants since falling into loan default two years ago. The bargain-basement sale price aligns with\nrecent Yardi Research data\nclaiming 67 percent of offices in San Francisco have sold for less than their previous values in the past two years.\nFashion brand Diesel had a 10,000-square-foot flagship on the ground floor of the 800 Market Street building, but it closed its doors in 2021. Prior to that, in 2018, the building housed the first location of\nWeWork\u2019s \u201cHQ by WeWork\u201d\nprogram, which offered standalone private offices for mid-sized companies. WeWork ended up moving to terminate its lease commitments at several downtown San Francisco, including at 800 Market, by 2023.\n\nNew owner Fountainhead plans a long-term \u201cpublic-facing\u201d activation for the ground-floor retail space, according to the Business Times.\n\u201cWe love this building \u2014 frankly, it\u2019s one of the most unique office buildings that I\u2019ve been in,\u201d Wyatt Cerny, Fountainhead\u2019s vice president of real estate, told the Chronicle. Under previous ownership, the structure underwent an \u201cextensive renovation\u201d more than a decade ago that \u201cbrought it up to modern standards.\n\u201cIt\u2019s got the flatiron shape. You go in and there are creative offices that have perfect floor plate sizes \u2014 5,600 square feet,\u201d Cerny said.\nThe goal is to revive the intersection of Market, Ellis and Stockton Streets.\nForever 21\nclosed its flagship at 2 Stockton Street in 2019 with the three-story property still vacant today; Disney followed in 2021 by departing 39 Stockton Street. \u201cWe want to bring life and energy back to that corner,\u201d Cerny said.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The first was completed in 2021, while the latter was completed last year. They are each 14 stories tall and house a similar unit count. Amenities include an indoor swimming pool, outdoor patio with a grilling area, hot tub, sauna, locker rooms, fitness center with track, indoor basketball court, children\u2019s playroom as well as movie screening room.\nThe property is located at 601-607 Ridge Hill Boulevard, less than 20 miles away from Midtown Manhattan.\nThere\u2019s more to come, too: Azorim North America\u2019s Chief Operating Officer Jack Klein said work recently began on a third building, which will feature 174 units and is expected to be completed in the next 18 months.\n\nA Walker &amp; Dunlop team of Jonathan Zilber and Joel Chetner arranged the financing.\nAzorim North America is a subsidiary of Azorim, a development firm based in Israel. The firm also has a 250-unit transit-oriented development on Hudson Street in Yonkers, one of New York\u2019s largest cities outside of the Big Apple itself.\nAzorim North America has its next Yonkers project up its sleeve: a 672-unit development at 143 Woodworth Avenue that\u2019s a short walk from the Metro North station, similar to another complex at Hudson Street in which the developer provides a shuttle to the train at the Ridge Hill complex.\nThe multifamily development market in Westchester County has been booming in recent years, but developers are becoming\nincreasingly concerned\nabout the influx of units, fearful of competition and the need for concessions.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A Chicago developer is testing how far Fulton Market\u2019s housing boom can stretch.\nLG Group\nfiled plans with the city for a five-story, 66-unit residential building at 1201-19 West Kinzie Street, on the northwestern edge of the fast-growing district. The project, which needs Chicago City Council approval, would total 65,000 square feet with a mix of studios through four-bedrooms, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Twenty percent of the units would be set aside as affordable under city rules. The plans don\u2019t specify whether the building would be apartments or condos.\nThe site belongs to Sterling Bay, which has been slimming down its portfolio while sorting through financial strain tied to Lincoln Yards, once planned as a $6 billion megadevelopment. The developer recently sold off a site at\n350 North Morgan Street\n, where it had zoning for a 39-story tower, and it is marketing others in and around Fulton Market. CBRE has been shopping the Kinzie parcel for over a year, along with two nearby sites, and a marketing brochure now lists it as under contract. A Sterling Bay spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nIf it lands approvals, LG\u2019s project would be one of several mid-rises just outside Fulton Market\u2019s traditional borders. Other proposals in the area include a seven-story, 79-unit building at 450 North Morgan Street and a 72-unit complex at\n455 North Carpenter Street\n. Developers have already packed Fulton Market proper with a wave of towers and mid-rises, and the spillover to its northern and western edges signals that momentum isn\u2019t slowing.\nLG\nis already a familiar player in the neighborhood. The firm delivered a 368-unit high-rise at 210 North Aberdeen Street this spring, and a 166-unit building on West Jackson Boulevard in the West Loop. It also has towers on deck at 1143 and 1150 West Lake Street.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Plans called for a restaurant, beach club, cabanas and a swim-up island bar.\nThe project was to be designed by Houston-based Project Luong and managed by Grand Prairie-based American Resort Management, in partnership with Travel + Leisure. Groundbreaking was expected in the third quarter of last year but never materialized.\nAccording to the source, Sports Hospitality Ventures cut off communications with Houston-based Land Tejas, developer of the 2,033-acre master-planned\nLago Mar\ncommunity, sometime last year.\nCity records back that up: Texas City engineer Kim Golden said this spring that the city hadn\u2019t received any applications for a resort at the site. Zoning allows for either a hotel or townhomes.\n\nSports Illustrated Resorts\n, launched in 2023 through a partnership with Sports Hospitality Ventures, licenses its brand from Authentic Brands Group, which owns the magazine\u2019s intellectual property.\nThe resort was supposed to anchor a planned $100 million entertainment district around the lagoon, which already includes a public beach attraction called Lagoonfest Texas and resident-only areas. The broader plan envisioned a boardwalk with retail, dining and condos. Houston-based\nWan Bridge\ndelivered a 151-unit townhome project called Crystal View at Lago Mar last year, but the resort piece never got off the ground.\nTexas City isn\u2019t an isolated case for the Sports Illustrated Resorts venture. A resort announced for Tuscaloosa, Alabama, lost its hotel component, according to the Tuscaloosa News. A proposed project in Mississippi was put on hold pending lower interest rates, while another in Ann Arbor, Michigan, was scrapped altogether after pushback from city officials and residents. Even a previously touted Orlando resort has disappeared from the brand\u2019s website.\nThe only operating SI Resort is in the Dominican Republic and opened in 2022. Two more \u2014 in\nChicago and Nashville\n\u2014 are listed as \u201ccoming soon\u201d on the brand\u2019s site. The Chicago launch is set to occupy Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Hotel Chicago site.\nMeanwhile, The Lagoon Development Company is expanding across Greater Houston with its signature turquoise pools, powered by Crystal Lagoons\u2019 water treatment technology. Lagoons in Dayton, Magnolia and Katy are in various stages of opening or construction, with more tied to entertainment districts.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Business First\nreported\n. Port officials are seeking proposals for the new terminal, dubbed Pier 500.\nThe facility, along with the neighboring Port of Long Beach, is among the busiest in the U.S. and world, and often cited as a linchpin in a logistics chain that has kept Southern California\u2019s industrial real estate sector a hot spot for decades.\nPier 500 is envisioned as a 200-acre site along the port\u2019s Pier 400 Channel. Once complete, it would bring two new berths and approximately 3,000 feet of new available wharf space to the southern end of Terminal Island at the port. In doing so, the new terminal would increase cargo efficiency at the port by accommodating larger, newer cargo ships.\nThe proposed Pier 500 project would utilize an existing site where the port identified 124 acres of submerged infrastructure added during the construction of the adjacent Pier 400 more than 20 years ago. Overall, it\u2019s expected it will take about 10 years from pre-development to operation.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in a generation, the Port of Los Angeles plans to build a new container terminal to meet global supply chain demand for decades into the future,\u201d Gene Seroka, executive director of the Port of Los Angeles,\nsaid\nin a statement.\nOnce the port selects an applicant through its request for proposals, officials will work with them in a public-private pre-development agreement. After that, they would determine the project\u2019s financial feasibility, followed by procuring entitlements and tying up any other loose ends needed to begin construction.\nThe announcement comes after the port saw its busiest month on record in July. That month, the Port handled 1,019,837 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), marking an 8.5 percent increase from the previous July. With the threat of higher tariffs later this year looming, retailers and manufacturers imported goods ahead of time in anticipation of those hikes.\n\u201cShippers have been frontloading their cargo for months to get ahead of tariffs and recent activity at America\u2019s top port really tells that story,\u201d Seroka\nsaid\nat the time. \u201cPort terminals in July were jam-packed with ships loaded with cargo, processed without any delay.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Asana Partners paid $62.1 million for a shopping center anchored by Milam\u2019s Markets and Walgreens near Coral Gables.\nThe Charlotte, North Carolina-based firm bought the 92,100-square-foot Red Bird Center at 5761 Bird Road in unincorporated Miami-Dade County from Red Bird Associates, according to a news release from the seller\u2019s broker. The 5.6-acre property is in the Coral Terrace neighborhood.\nDanny Finkle and Jorge Portela led the JLL team that represented the seller.\nRed Bird Associates is managed by Stephen Brandon of Miami-Dade-based The Brandon Company and Mark Morgan of Overland Park, Kansas-based MD Management, state corporate records show.\nRed Bird Center is fully leased, the release says. Tenants include Ace Hardware, Space Coast Credit Union, Quest Diagnostics, AT&amp;T, as well as an animal clinic, pizzeria and eye care office. The property includes an Orion Fuels gas station.\nBrandon Company, led by President Jeff Brandon, is a commercial real estate development firm founded in 1974, its website says. MD Management, led by Morgan, is a family-owned real estate developer and manager, according to its website.\nAsana \u2013\u2013 led by Terry S. Brown, Sam E. Judd and Jason K. Tompkins \u2013\u2013 has been investing in South Florida in recent years. In 2018, Asana bought a seven-building r\netail portfolio\nat 1787, 1919, 1928 Purdy Avenue; 1900, 1916, 1930 Bay Road; and 1935 West Avenue in Miami Beach\u2019s Sunset Harbour neighborhood for\n$68.8 million\nfrom Scott Robins and Philip Levine.\n\nLast year, Asana sold seven West Palm Beach warehouses repurposed into retail, restaurants and offices, collectively known as the Warehouse District, at 1300, 1400, 1500 and 1220-1250 Elizabeth Avenue and 1615 Clare Avenue for\n$19.5 million\n. Asana had bought the properties for\n$18.5 million\nin 2018 from Johnstone Capital Partners, which had repurposed the warehouses.\nIn Fort Lauderdale\u2019s Flagler Village, Asana bought the retail properties at 723-737 Northeast Second Avenue and 900-924 North Flagler Drive for\n$18.3 million\n, as well as the office and industrial building at 707 Northeast Third Avenue for\n$10 million\nin 2022.\nAsana declined to comment on whether it has a redevelopment plan for Red Bird Center.\nSouth Florida\u2019s\nretail\nmarket began to calm earlier this year amid higher interest rates and slower influx of out-of-staters. In the second quarter, vacancies increased in each of the three counties and the average asking rent dropped in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, according to a\nColliers report\n.\nGrocery-anchored\nshopping centers have remained\nresilient\nwith continued investment sales. In June, Barry Sternlicht\u2019s Starwood Capital Group sold the Whole Foods-anchored Marketplace at the Outlets shopping center at 1821 Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard in West Palm Beach for\n$133.2 million\n. Longpoint paid\n$34 million\nin July for the Presidente Supermarket-anchored Miramar Parkway Plaza at 3176 South University Drive in Miramar.\nIn other recent shopping center deals, JBL Asset Management bought Palm Square at 9941 Pines Boulevard in Pembroke Pines for\n$25 million\n.\n",

        "content": "Electronic document signature company Docusign is preparing to sign a notable deal of its own.\nDocusign is in talks to lease an additional two floors at its 221 Main Street headquarters in San Francisco, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. It would give Docusign about 50,000 square feet of additional office space on top of its existing 93,000-square-foot headquarters at the building.\nThe company is also planning to extend its original lease at the building. Its existing lease expires July 31, 2029, according to the Business Times. The deal has reportedly been in the works for months, though it has not yet been finalized.\nWith the new expansion, Docusign will bring its headquarters footprint closer to its pre-pandemic square footage. In the 2021 fiscal year, the firm grew its headquarters from approximately 150,000 square feet to 211,000 square feet. But the following year, it shrunk back down to 150,000 square feet. It\nrenewed its lease\nat 221 Main Street in the 2023 fiscal year, albeit in a smaller footprint at 93,000 square feet.\n\nThe 221 Main Street building is owned by\nPIMCO\nPrime Real Estate and managed by subsidiary Columbia Property Trust. Last month, news surfaced that fintech company Affirm was approaching a\ndeal to move its headquarters\ninto 47,000 square feet across two floors at the approximately 389,000-square-foot building. Late last year, math-focused private school Proof School inked a deal for 35,000 square feet on the building\u2019s first and second floors.\nAs of January of this year, Docusign has 850 employees in San Francisco and 6,838 workers overall, according to the Business Times. By that metric, the company is the 19th-largest tech employer in the city.\nDocusign is currently hiring for several dozen positions with a hybrid work model, according to the Business Times. As companies across the Bay Area implement a post-pandemic\nreturn to the office\n, Docusign is among the firms that are having to grow their offices once again to accommodate more workers. Okta, for example, recently took back two floors at its 100 First Street headquarters that it previously looked to sublease to another tenant.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Spooky season is in full swing in the Alamo City, where the state of the\nmultifamily market has scared off developers\n.\nSan Antonio posted the largest percent decline in new multifamily permits of cities nationwide, according to a HomeAbroad analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data. The report looked at the period between 2020 and 2025.\nThe city saw 526 multifamily construction permits filed in 2020, and just 18 filed so far this year, a 96.6 percent decline. The pipeline collapsed even though San Antonio continues is experiencing rapid growth,\nranking fourth in the nation\nin terms of new residents. Nearly 24,000 people moved to San Antonio between 2023 and 2024.\nIn the last five years, Austin saw a 29 percent drop in new permits (from 1,868 to 1,321) and permits fell 14 percent in Houston (from 1,669 to 1,409). Dallas-Fort Worth bucked the trend, with permits jumping nearly 20 percent (from 4,847 to 5,800).\nA rush of apartment construction in Texas over the last few years has resulted in a glut of new product coming online. As a result,\noccupancy and rent rates have declined\nin the major Texas metros.\n\nSan Antonio ranks\nsecond in the country for rental affordability\n, with renters spending an average of 17 percent of their income on housing, JLL\u2019s Kai Penn said during a Connect CRE conference on the multifamily market in the Lone Star State.\nHalfway through the year, average occupancy was 93.2 percent, and average asking rent was $1,237 per month in San Antonio, according to a report from Newmark. The drastic contraction of the multifamily development pipeline will increase these levels.\nEven though the pipeline has dried up, San Antonio is still in need of additional housing. The metro is underbuilt by more than 25,000 housing units, according to a 2024 report by the housing advocacy organization Up for Growth.\nDallas-Fort Worth\u2019s housing shortage is nearly five times higher, with the Metroplex still underbuilt by 122,000 units. Houston is short 79,000 units, and Austin is short 24,000 units.\n",

The purchase breaks down to $461,111 per apartment.\nThe buyer borrowed a $78.4 million Fannie Mae loan for the purchase. The loan matures in 2030.\nRobert Given and Zach Sackley were part of the CBRE team that represented the seller.\nCompleted in 2018 and 2019, Bell at Broken Sound consists of 22 three-story apartment buildings and a pair of clubhouses on a 14.4-acre site, according to a Tishman Speyer news release and Vizzda records. It has one-bedroom to three-bedroom units, with monthly rents ranging from $2,279 to $4,390, the property\u2019s website shows.\nThe units break down to 180 apartments and 90 townhouses, the release says.\nTishman Speyer plans amenity, technology and interior improvements, according to the release.\n\nThe complex is within\nThe Park at Broken Sound\n, a 700-acre mixed-use development with offices, apartments and light industrial space.\nBell Partners, led by Lili F. Dunn, had paid $94.3 million for Bell at Broken Sound Apartments in 2020, records show.\nLed by Rob Speyer,\nTishman Speyer\nhas been slowly beefing up its South Florida real estate investments over the past year. Last year, it paid\n$100.2 million\nfor the two-warehouse Rock Lake Business Center at 3150-3250 Northwest 33rd Street in Pompano Beach, marking its first known industrial investment in Florida. It was the\nfifth biggest\nindustrial deal last year in South Florida.\nFounded in 1978 by Jerry Speyer and the late Robert Tishman, Tishman Speyer has purchased and developed about 34,000 apartments and condos in the U.S., Brazil, China and Europe, the release says.\nSouth Florida\u2019s\nmultifamily market\nis experiencing an uptick in investment sales in recent months after a calming over the past two years due to elevated interest rates and a slowdown of the influx of out-of-staters. During the pandemic, the tri-county region\u2019s market was supercharged by unprecedented demand from newcomers and record rent growth.\nIn Palm Beach County, multifamily investment sales totaled $3.9 billion in 2021 and $1.8 billion in 2022, according to data provided by Avison Young. Activity dropped to $668 million in 2023 and $1 billion last year. Palm Beach County investment sales totaled $120 million during the first half of this year, the Avison data shows.\nBuyers still purchasing apartments generally are relying on discretionary funds that have to deploy their capital, or are borrowing Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae loans, or obtaining loans from insurers, which usually have better terms than bank financing. Some are all-cash buyers, such as Spain\u2019s richest person, Amancio Ortega, who paid\n$165 million\nin June for the 259-unit Veneto Las Olas apartment tower at 201 South Federal Highway in downtown Fort Lauderdale.\nLast month, Legacy Residential Group paid\n$77 million\nfor the 416-unit Legacy at Coconut Creek complex at 4303 West Atlantic Boulevard in Coconut Creek. This month, AEW Capital Management and Mast Capital sold the 342-unit Remi on the River building at\u00a0 999 Northwest Seventh Street in Miami for\n$108.4 million\n. Buyer Valeris Capital borrowed $72.3 million from The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company.",

Units span one to four bedrooms. Treo completed the first VOX building with 99 units and 326 beds in 2021.

Treo is leasing the 6.2-acre development site from Miami-Dade County. It launched the project in 2020 with an initial\n$33.25 million construction loan\nfrom Centennial Bank.\nStudent housing\nhas emerged as a favorite asset class among real estate investors for its strong rent growth, stable demand and perceived recession resistance. Buildings are rented on a per-bed basis rather than per-unit. Last year, Chicago-based Harrison Street Capital Partners closed a\n$2.5 billion investment fund\nfor student housing, senior housing and data centers.\nBlackstone\nlanded a $1 billion refinancing deal for part of its student housing portfolio last year.\nIn South Florida, hundreds of units are in the pipeline for projects that target University of Miami students.

The sites are\nco-owned\nwith Harkham Family Enterprises, run by Uri Harkham.\n\nArchitectural plans from Los Angeles-based Ottinger Architects for 333-353 South Beverly call for an 85-foot building with 135 units. The project would span 202,570 square feet with homes ranging from one- to three-bedrooms. Twenty-seven of them would be earmarked for low-income households. The communal roofdeck will include a pool and spa, fire pit as well as outdoor cooking and sitting areas.\nThe Olympic Boulevard building would span 282,620 square feet, per Ottinger Architects plans, with one- to three-bedrooms and a roof deck and gym. Twenty-one units would be set aside for low-income tenants.\nNext week\u2019s Planning Commission\u2019s public hearing will be the first time the commission is considering the projects, according to Michael Forbes, director of community development for the city. The commission will then deliberate on the project and vote to approve or deny the project, likely at the same meeting, he said.\nSeparately, Aflalo Equities, in a joint venture with Fisch Property, the property management arm of the family business, is\nplanning\ntwo 10-story buildings \u2014 one at\n9430 Olympic Boulevard\nand the other at 9441 West Olympic Boulevard, with 45 units and 63 units, respectively. The former would replace a three-story office building, while the latter would replace a two-story office building, per the preliminary applications.\nIn addition, at 8822-8826 West Olympic Boulevard, Aflalo Equities plans to replace a single-story commercial building with a nine-story 30-unit building.\n",

        "content": "Three skyscrapers in downtown Los Angeles designed to house the homeless could end up costing federal taxpayers more than $1 billion.\nHomeless services nonprofit Weingart Center Association is behind the three towers, which would utilize federal Section 8 Housing vouchers to repay the state and city and to fund private developer fees and investor returns over the buildings\u2019 55-year life, The Center Square\nreported\n.\n\u201cTaxpayers are being forced to foot the bill for over $800,000 per unit for homeless housing,\u201d Susan Shelley, vice president of communications for the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, told The Center Square. \u201cThere should be an audit to determine if this is genuinely the best option to provide housing or if this is just making a lot of people rich off the taxpayers\u2019 dime.\u201d\nWeingart opened a 19-story, 278-unit tower in Skid Row last year. The project cost $167.7 million, or more than $600,000 per unit. The tower was funded with $32 million of the city\u2019s homeless housing bond, a $1.8 million land loan from the City of Los Angeles, $48.7 million in deferrable loans from the California Department of Housing and Community Development, $56.9 million in tax credit equity and $85.3 million in tax-exempt bonds. Developer Chelsea Investment Corporation, meanwhile, earned $18.3 million in development fees.\nThis summer, Weingart opened a second tower that cost $171 million for 298 units. That project,\ndeveloped by Related Companies\n, is estimated to be in line to generate $534 million in federal voucher revenue over its lifespan. A third tower containing 104 units is now in the planning phase with a $865,656-per-unit price tag, or $90 million total; at that figure, it costs more to build one of these units than to pay the median price for an entire home in the state. Related is set to collect $10.4 million in fees on that project.\nThe dependence on government financing and high costs per unit of the recent developments come a sPrivate-sector construction of market-rate housing in Los Angeles has fallen in recent years.\u00a0 Permitting approvals for government-regulated affordable housing climbed to 60 percent in fiscal year 2023-2024 from 24 percent in the previous four years, according to The Center Square.\nMany real estate insiders\nblame Measure ULA\n, which charges a transfer tax on big-ticket property sales. A recent report from UCLA bears out that finding, noting that the transfer taxes can be linked to notable declines in housing production and property tax revenue growth, per The Center Square.\n\nGuests at\nThe Real Deal\u2019s Building Back L.A. roundtable\nlast month echoed that sentiment with real-life anecdotes.\n\u201cBuyers and sellers are absolutely disgruntled over ULA, and it is not going away. It\u2019s actually getting worse every day,\u201d\nAaron Kirman\n, CEO of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California, said. \u201cWhen you are doing these deals and sellers can be charged anywhere between 4.5 and 5 percent additional fees on top of commissions and closing costs and everything else, it\u2019s make it or break it for a lot of these developers, not only on the luxury level, but for apartments, for retail, and everything in the middle.\u201d\n\u201cIt really has probably stopped 50 percent of the deals, maybe even more,\u201d Kirman added.\n\u201cWe have developers that would love to develop in L.A., that do develop in L.A., that are just saying until ULA gets off the books or changed substantially they\u2019re not going to do it,\u201d\nSean Burton\n, chairman and CEO of Cityview, also noted.\nThe Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association is working on accomplishing just that. The group is a proponent for a new initiative called the Local Taxpayer Protection Act to Save Proposition 13, which would repeal Measure ULA and similar transfer taxes. The proposal, which is collecting signatures until next February, would restore the prior maximum transfer tax of 0.11 percent.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The move keeps the firm in Richardson, where it\u2019s been based since 2008, and consolidates its Richardson and Dallas offices, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The company signed a 12-year lease at 2380 Performance Drive and plans to invest at least $13 million in tenant improvements for about 500 employees.\nCity officials made sure the deal stayed local. Richardson\u2019s City Council approved a $2.3 million retention and expansion grant last year, along with $130,000 in waived permit fees, to beat out at least two other cities that tried to lure the headquarters away.\n\u201cFujitsu has been in our community for nearly four decades now, so it was really meaningful as they evolved into 1Finity for us to keep them,\u201d City Manager Don Magner said.\nThe lease lands 1Finity in one of the city\u2019s premier office hubs. Galatyn Commons spans 800,000 square feet across four buildings, with amenities including a food hall, amphitheater and conference center.\n\nThe park has been steadily filling with high-profile tenants: Halff moved its headquarters there last year with an 80,000-square-foot lease backed by its own incentives deal, while CBRE planted a 131,000-square-foot office in 2022.

        "content": "An investor primed to go big on troubled office towers that recently bailed on a LaSalle Street deal is circling a Streeterville asset instead.\nColorado-based Real Capital Solutions is in advanced talks to acquire the 35-story Chicago office building at 401 North Michigan Avenue,\nsources told\nCrain\u2019s. The pending price isn\u2019t finalized, but the firm reportedly offered more than $130 million for the 747,500-square-foot tower at the Chicago River. That\u2019s $174 per square foot and a steep drop from the $360 million Chicago-based Walton Street Capital paid in 2017, though not as brutal a discount as other downtown fire sales.\nReal Capital\nshifted its plans, as it had the 40-story tower at\n190 South LaSalle\nunder contract earlier this summer before backing out. The firm is planning to deploy $3.5 billion into distressed office purchases nationwide over the next three years. Its affiliates recently scooped up heavily marked-down buildings in\nDallas\nand Washington, D.C., betting that values will rebound as the post-pandemic\noffice slump\nlevels off.\nHigh interest rates and lingering skepticism about the commercial property sector have kept transactions scarce, while many downtown towers are still encumbered by debt that exceeds valuations.\n\nIn fact, 401 North Michigan itself was previously the subject of a broken deal. The\nSaudi Arabian enterprise Olayan Group\nlate last year was in talks to acquire the building at a similar discount as Real Capital, but a purchase never moved forward.\nWalton Street refinanced the property in 2019 with a $160 million loan from the firm ING, and the debt\u2019s maturity date has been repeatedly extended. A sale at north of $175 a foot would not only wipe out the seller\u2019s equity but also leave the lender exposed. ING has signaled willingness to stay involved with the property and finance up to 60 percent of a buyer\u2019s purchase.\nLeasing metrics at 401 North Michigan are stronger than the downtown average, with the tower 88 percent occupied versus the 72 percent norm. However, near-term moveouts could drive that down to 76 percent. A long-term lease with the American Dental Association, which runs through 2040, and a weighted average lease term of more than seven years provide ballast that brokers at JLL are highlighting to prospective buyers.\n\u2014 Rachel Stone\n",

That\u2019s more than double its pre-pandemic level, according to CBRE. Vacancy has increased for 13 straight quarters, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Companies have shed 2.3 million square feet downtown over the past two years \u2014 almost twice the space lost during the Great Recession \u2014 leaving landlords and lenders to grapple with a prolonged downturn.\nThat weakness has chilled the investment sales market, where institutional buyers have largely stayed on the sidelines. Property tax revenue from downtown office buildings \u2014 a critical source for the city \u2014 has also eroded, raising the stakes for a recovery.\nBut the market split is widening. Vacancy at older, second-tier Class B properties ballooned to nearly 35 percent in the third quarter, while Class A vacancy landed at 21.4 percent.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tale of two markets,\u201d CBRE\u2019s Todd Lippman told the outlet, noting that top-tier towers with lots of perks and amenities are drawing steady demand while commodity space languishes.\nThat demand has fueled rent growth for trophy assets even as broader asking rents have barely budged. Colliers data shows average gross rents across downtown offices have ticked up just 1 percent since 2020, while rents at the newest glass-and-steel towers have surged 26 percent. Recent deals illustrate the trend: law firm\nKilpatrick Townsend\nsigned on for a floor at BMO Tower on Canal Street, consolidating from multiple Loop offices, while private equity shop\nWind Point Partners\nis set to sublease space at Salesforce Tower.\n\nOverall absorption was negative last quarter, with tenants vacating 51,000 more square feet than they leased. Evolent Health\u2019s exit from nearly 124,000 square feet at\n300 South Riverside Plaza\nwas the biggest hit, outweighing expansions by JPMorgan Chase and Adyen. CBRE expects net absorption to stay flat as more leases roll and tenants reassess footprints.\nLaw firms may offer a glimmer of stability. Lippman noted that most are no longer aggressively cutting space, and some are even growing, unlike the contraction cycle that reshaped the sector a decade ago.\nInvestment sales are scarce, though some local and opportunistic players are wading in. Blue Star Properties paid $28 million for\n2 North Riverside Plaza\n\u2014 the historic former home of the Chicago Daily News \u2014 earlier this summer, while 601W is under contract to buy the distressed\n175 West Jackson\n.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Starwood Capital Group is letting other developers in on the action at an upcoming master-planned community in southeast Austin.\nMiami-based Starwood listed 230 acres for sale at its 1,400-acre Revelry development in Del Valle, a community about 10 miles from downtown, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThere are 16 parcels for sale within the community to be built at the intersection of Pearce Lane and Wolf Lane. The land ranges in designated use from commercial to multifamily to retail. Avison Young\u2019s Mike Kennedy, Sullivan Johnston and James Nelson have the listings.\nAt full build-out, Revelry will have 2,300 single-family homes as well as multifamily and commercial development. Brightland Homes, Perry Homes, David Weekley Homes, Highland Homes, Coventry Homes, Toll Brothers and Lennar have already signed on to build at the community.\nDel Valle is an unincorporated area with a\npopulation of about 29,000\nat the edge of Austin-Bergstrom International Airport. It\u2019s known for being home to the Circuit of the Americas, the race track that hosts the Formula One U.S. Grand Prix.\n\nRevelry, formerly known as Mirador, is one of the developments Starwood purchased from Hines earlier this year in an\n$800 million deal\nthat included 11 communities. In addition to Revelty, the portfolio includes seven DFW properties and three in Houston.\nDuring this economic cycle, master-planned communities have been shielded from the doldrums of the housing market, but, midway through this year, they started to feel the pain, too.\nNew home sales in the country\u2019s top master-planned communities\ndropped nearly 7 percent\nbetween June 2024 to June 2025, according to real estate consultant RCLCO. That\u2019s about on par with new homes in the overall market, which posted a 6.6 percent decline during that period.\nTexas is the second-largest market for master-planned communities in the country, making up 34 percent of the top 50 master-planned communities, per RCLCO. At the city level,\nHouston takes the crown\n.\n\u2013 Jess Hardin\n",

        "content": "On Sunday, the leader of New York City pulled the plug on his reelection campaign.\nAfter months of speculations \u2014 and years of scandals \u2014 Eric Adams\nofficially dropped his bid\nto come back as mayor of New York City.\nEven as Adams resisted pressure to abandon the race, his departure felt inevitable as he struggled to keep up in the polls with three other candidates. A coalescing around a candidate to compete with Zohran Mamdani has long been a clarion call among watchers.\nAdams still has a few months left at Gracie Mansion, but The Real Deal columnist Erik Engquist evaluated the\nreal estate legacy\nthe 110th mayor will leave.\nWhile Adams was dropping out of the race, the New York Mets were putting the final nail in the coffin of a collapse that left the team out of the MLB playoffs. But this week wasn\u2019t all bad for owner Steve Cohen.\nHis plan for an $8 billion casino complex is\nheading to the final round\nof the state\u2019s casino licensing competition after a community advisory committee voted unanimously to advance Metropolitan Park, a project that would transform 50 acres of parking lots next to Citi Field.\nThat leaves a list of four contenders for three downstate gaming licenses: MGM Empire City in Yonkers; Queens Aqueduct Casino, operated by Resorts World; and Bally\u2019s in Throggs Neck.\nMost expect the state to grant MGM and Resorts World two of the licenses because they both already operate as racinos. That would leave Bally\u2019s and Metropolitan Park proposals competing against each other for the last license.\n\nOn the legal front, Meyer Chetrit was\ncriminally indicted\nin Manhattan for harassing rent-regulated tenants in Chelsea, accused of waging a five-year campaign of harassment against two septuagenarians to force them out of their building.\nCharges include two counts of harassment of a rent-regulated tenant in the first degree, a class E felony carrying a maximum sentence of four years in prison.\nGet excited, connoisseurs of Swedish meatballs. An entity connected to Ikea\npurchased 529 Broadway\nin Soho from Jeff Sutton for $213 million. It\u2019s a 58,000-square-foot commercial building occupied by Nike.\nThe investment group is planning to open an Ikea location across the first and second floors, totaling 25,000 square feet.\nAlso, of interest this week, the developers behind the iconic Flatiron Building\u2019s conversion have\nunveiled\nthe project\u2019s initial pricing, where the projected sellout is $375 million for 18 of its 35 residential units.\nPrices for the available units start just under $11 million; the two most expensive condos are asking $48 million and $50 million.\nThe Brodsky Organization and Sorgente Group are the developers, while Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group is handling sales, which appear to have begun.\n",

        "content": "New York City agents, cross your fingers, knock on wood and say a prayer because the residential market might be headed for a solid end to the year.\nThough typically one of the weakest periods, macroeconomic factors \u2014 namely\nlower mortgage rates\n\u2014 could prove fertile ground for a number of deals, particularly at the lower end of the market, said appraiser and data expert Jonathan Miller.\nMetrics from last quarter\nmight, at first glance, cast doubt on that theory. Though sales were up overall, the borough logged more activity at the higher end of the market, where buyers are less sensitive to mortgage rates and can often close deals in cash, Miller\u2019s report showed.\nDuring the period, co-op and condo sales backed by financing actually fell 9 percent year-over-year and accounted for only 35 percent of all deals for the property type.\nHowever, Miller cautioned that the effect of a lower mortgage rate environment isn\u2019t yet reflected in the data.\n\u201cMuch of that drop in rates started a third or almost halfway into the quarter,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the full impact. That\u2019ll spill over into and have more of an impact on sales next quarter.\u201d\nBut Miller\u2019s optimistic forecast comes with a big if. It hinges, in part, on mortgage rates falling further or holding steady at their current levels, which may or may not happen even if the central bank\nvotes to lower\nthe federal funds rate again.\nAn early look at deals likely to close next quarter does show signs of life, according to Miller\u2019s monthly report.\nNew signed contracts in September rose modestly in Manhattan, up 1 percent from year-ago numbers. New listings hitting the market notched more significant growth, up more than 7 percent annually \u2014 an increase Miller attributed to sellers gaining confidence in a more affordable marketplace.\nThe story was similar in Brooklyn, where new signed contracts rose by 6 percent and new listings 7 percent.\nHowever, much of the growth in each borough was still fueled by the luxury market, defined in Manhattan as deals above $4 million and above $2 million in Brooklyn.\nBut if mortgage rates continue on the current trend, that balance could shift in October.\nNot so fast\u2026\n\nAn Upper East Side couple is chasing a dream few in Manhattan achieve \u2014 a private pool. The rarified amenity isn\u2019t coming easy.\nHedge funder Zachary Kurz and his wife, Brittany Morgan, whose family owns Morgan Properties, are renovating their double-wide home on East 77th Street, which they bought two years ago for $30 million, the\nNew York Post\nreported.\nTheir plans include adding a pool to the basement, a pursuit their neighbors, an ophthalmologist and former dermatologist in their 70s, are strongly opposing.\nThe couple\u2019s resistance could stand in the way of Kurz and Morgan achieving their vision, one that only a slice of New Yorkers have access to. A study\npublished in Curbed\nin 2021 found a total of roughly 15,000 private pools citywide, a tally that includes pools in condo towers, hotels and in private backyards.\nThat number may look like a lot, but considering the Big Apple has more than 8 million residents and more than 3 million housing units, it\u2019s a small piece of the pie. Even fewer of those pools are attached to single-family homes across the city. Mill Bergen Pools owner Bob Blanda estimates just 50 underground pools in townhouses in Manhattan, Blanda told the Post.\nTo build the pool, Kurz and Morgan need access to their neighbor\u2019s property, and the couple has so far refused to grant it. Kurz and Morgan sued the couple in August, hoping a court might intervene and greenlight their plans, though their neighbors have since filed a counter lawsuit.\nIn their counterclaim, the neighbors allege the construction would infringe upon their property and cause \u201cirreparable damage\u201d to their health and home.\nKurz and Morgan\u2019s \u201cdesire to have an underground swimming pool is causing\nenormous\ninconvenience to its directly adjacent neighbors,\u201d the couple\u2019s attorney wrote. \u201cWe implore your client to simply scale back its project.\u201d\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe most expensive sale recorded in the city register this week was for a Greenwich Village townhouse sold by the founder of the company, Big Ass Solutions. J. Carey Smith, his wife, Nancy Smith and their son, Tristan Smith, sold their home at 11 West 12th Street for\n$26.5 million\n.\nThe couple purchased the five-story abode for just under $20 million in 2019 and listed it for $27 million earlier this year. The 25-foot-wide townhouse spans 9,700 square feet and has five bedrooms, six bathrooms, two terraces and a garage.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Mark Fromm and Claudia Saez-Fromm had the listing. Corcoran\u2019s Dana Power brought the buyer, whose identity is shielded by an LLC.\n",

        "content": "To say the Soho/Noho rezoning has not met expectations would be an understatement.\nBut a residential project at 43 Bleecker Street might provide a template for developers eyeing the neighborhood.\nThe project, an 11-unit condo conversion of a historic six-story building by the Caedes Group, is the first to take advantage of a long-available option for developers looking to meet Mandatory Inclusionary Housing requirements.\nDevelopers have historically met those requirements by building the affordable units themselves, but projects of a certain size and unit count are eligible to pay into the Department of Housing Preservation and Development\u2019s Affordable Housing Fund.\nIt\u2019s essentially a Goldilocks situation. Projects adding fewer than 10 units and less than 12,500 square feet of residential floor area generally qualify for MIH exceptions, while projects adding over 25,000 square feet or over 25 units generally need to build the units themselves.\nBut developments adding less than 25,000 square feet of residential floor area and less than 25 units can contribute to HPD\u2019s Affordable Housing Fund, which is a pool of money for, yes, developing affordable housing.\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised that the first residential conversion to contribute to the Affordable Housing Fund is a conversion in Noho,\u201d said Vivien Krieger, a land use expert with Akerman LLP who added the housing stock in the area is \u201cripe for this.\u201d\nThe option is not cheap: The most recent contribution schedule requires developers to pay $1,130 per square foot of required affordable housing, down almost 7 percent from the previous year. (Caedes is paying almost $6 million into the fund, according to a declaration filed with the city.)\nBut for certain projects, it can be a lifeline for getting things to pencil out, according to Belkin Burden Goldman\u2019s David Shamshovich, whose firm facilitated the transaction.\n\u201cIt\u2019s prohibitively expensive if you don\u2019t have the right project in mind,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you may not actually get out of the ground and move forward with a project if this wasn\u2019t available.\u201d\nThe fund contribution also gives developers a reliable fixed cost for their project, where affordable housing \u2014 especially with talk of rent freezes on the horizon \u2014 can feel like a risky proposition, Shamshovich added. \u201cAny issues that are raised with rent stabilization will naturally affect\u201d affordable units, he said.\nAnd while it\u2019s refreshing to see a whopping 11 new units coming to Soho/Noho, the rezoning there \u201ctotally failed,\u201d according to PropertyScout CEO Wilson Parry, who shared data showing just several hundred residential units proposed for the heavily landmarked area.\nWhat\u2019s more, while using the fee-in-lieu options might spur more immediate market rate development, it doesn\u2019t do anything to address affordability in the immediate future. \u201cThe city is not getting affordable housing right away,\u201d Shamshovich said. \u201cThey\u2019re getting money.\u201d\nThe requirements around using that money are stringent. For the first 10 years after money is contributed, the city must use it in the same community district, meaning in this case, the challenges of developing affordable housing in Soho are shunted off to the public sector.\n\nAfter all is said and done, the city may end up with just a handful of expensive new condos in Soho and an unallocated pool of money. But almost five years after its rezoning and with little to show for it, something might be better than nothing.\n\u201cIt gives people the understanding we can actually do this and proceed, and our site doesn\u2019t have to be stalled,\u201d Shamshovich said. \u201cI think it gives a lot of hope, particularly in the Soho/Noho area, where MIH hasn\u2019t been very good.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: The Wall Street Journal\npointed out\nthe anomalous growth between GDP (good) and jobs (not so good), positing that we might be in the midst of an AI-driven productivity boom. Most real estate brokerages on earnings calls talk about using AI to speed up operations, but is anyone in the industry using it for something unexpected beyond synthesizing documents and writing emails? Email me at\njacob.indursky@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: For those unfortunate enough to be groundbound last weekend, there was an unmistakable whir in the air from the helicopters flying back and forth to the Ryder Cup in Farmingdale, Long Island. Somebody was kind enough to produce a\nvisual encapsulation\nof the buzzing aircraft, but the fun might not be for long. City Council in April\npassed a law\nthat might cut down on heli-trips starting in 2029. I, personally, will never get aboard one, not that I\u2019ve been invited\u2026\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 In preparation of its planned phaseout of MetroCards, the MTA will be limiting OMNY card service this weekend, Gothamist\nreported\n. From Friday at 7 p.m. to Sunday at 10 p.m., riders will be unable to purchase new OMNY cards or reload existing cards. The MTA is advising weekend straphangers to load up their cards before the Friday evening deadline.\n\u2014 New York City will be looking at buying the homes of residents in flood-prone areas, starting with the infamous Brooklyn/Queens neighborhood nicknamed \u201cThe Hole,\u201d The City\nreported\n. The effort is part of the Resilient Acquisitions program piloted by the Mayor\u2019s office, which began collecting information on Friday from residents interested in volunteering their homes for sale.\n\u2014 The Trump administration is reversing what would have been the largest federal cut to New York\u2019s police force in decades, the New York Times\nreported\n. The Department of Homeland Security had initially defunded $187 million to New York\u2019s intelligence and counterterrorism, something President Donald Trump was reportedly unaware of until receiving a call from Gov. Kathy Hochul.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nCommercial:\nNew to the Market:\nBreaking Ground:\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

The commercial condos that sold span a combined 28,305 square feet, pricing them at about $760 per square foot.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nIn Carnegie Hill, a co-op at\n1175 Park Avenue\ntraded for $9.9 million. The sellers were\nRichard Hogan\nand\nCarron Sherry\n. The buyer was a trust. The transaction appears to have been off-market. A former listing shows the co-op as having five bedrooms and four full bathrooms.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nWilliam and Leslie Jacques\nparted with a condo at\n565 Broome Street\nin Hudson Square. The buyer,\nAIO NYC RE LLC\n, paid $7.5 million, about $3,300 per square foot, for the 2,200-square-foot unit. The residence has three bedrooms, three and a half baths and curved glass windows. The Jacques purchased it in 2019 for just over $7.7 million.\n\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nFinancier\nIan Wace\nand\nGioia Bini\nscooped up a co-op that was once home to Senator Jacob Javits and his wife Marion at\n322 East 57th Street\nin Sutton Place for a hair under $6 million. The seller was film producer\nDorothy Berwin\n, who had owned the unit since 2018, when she purchased it for $4 million. The duplex has four bedrooms, a private elevator landing and a curved staircase.\nBy the Numbers:\nMortgage rates on the up and up \u2014 again\nAfter hitting a year-to-date low last month,\nmortgage rates\nare on an upward trend again.\nThe average 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage rate was 6.34 percent for the week ending Thursday, according to\nFreddieMac\u2019s latest primary mortgage market survey\n. That\u2019s up 0.04 percentage points from the week before and 0.22 percentage points from the same time last year.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "As South Shore residents were jolted awake in the middle of the night to a controversial federal raid on their apartment building, a nasty legal battle between the building\u2019s owner and lender offers clues into how Chicago real estate turmoil escalated into a national news story.\nWells Fargo\u2019s foreclosure lawsuit against the property\u2019s landlord reveals that city officials were aware of serious problems with the complex well before the raid took place, but have shared nothing publicly about whether they had knowledge of federal agents\u2019 plans ahead of time.\nChicago code inspectors visited the 130-unit asset at 7500 South South Shore Drive two weeks before it was subject to a massive Department of Homeland Security operation that led to dozens of arrests on Sept. 30, raising questions over what city officials knew about alleged illegal activity taking place in the building prior to the jarring raid.\nThe building\u2019s owner, Wisconsin-based investor Trinity Flood, is currently facing\na $27 million foreclosure lawsuit\nfiled by Wells Fargo regarding missed loan payments on the property as well as several other properties in Chicago and across the U.S.\nOn Oct. 1, the day after the raid, a judge considered an emergency order requested by Wells Fargo to appoint Matthew Tarshis of Frontline Real Estate Partners as a receiver for the property. The judge determined a receiver would be determined at a later date. The decision came after two months of contentious back-and-forth between Flood and Wells Fargo.\nWells Fargo alleged that the bank was foreclosing on Trinity Flood not only because of missed loan payments but also due to the investor\u2019s failure to insure the 7500 South South Shore Drive property. But Trinity Flood hit back, stating that the lender-placed insurance plan they ended up with was significantly more expensive than a prior plan the building held and was based on \u201cinflated property values.\u201d The landlord used the ongoing dispute over the insurance plan as reason to request that a judge not grant Wells Fargo\u2019s emergency order for a receiver.\nThe same week that a judge was considering granting the emergency order for a receiver, the federal operation quickly garnered national attention. Residents in and around the building took photos and video of hundreds of government agents approaching the property, some from unmarked white vans and others from the back of rental trucks, photos show. Reporting from NewsNation, which was invited on the operation, states that agents descended from military helicopters, as well.\nWitnesses told reporters on the scene that most, if not all, of the tenants, including children and U.S. citizens, were rounded up and detained temporarily outside of the building.\nCustoms and Border Protection, the ATF and the FBI were all involved in the operation, which resulted in the arrests of 37 people, according to the Department of Homeland Security. A statement from the agency noted a preliminary review of the operation found that the 37 people arrested were undocumented and that subjects were \u201cbelieved to be involved in drug trafficking and distribution, weapons crimes, and immigration violators.\u201d\nMayor Brandon Johnson and Alderman Gregory Mitchell, who represents the area, have not issued official statements about the raid, besides a reference Johnson made to the operation during a Friday press conference. They did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\u201cThe South Side of Chicago is under siege with (President Trump\u2019s) federal agents that are terrorizing our communities, where Black families are being awakened in the middle of the night with masked armed men with high power weapons in their face,\u201d Johnson said.\nGovernor J.B. Pritzker denounced the operation on social media, sharing an article about it and writing, \u201cICE is running around Chicago harassing people for not being white. Just a year ago, that was illegal in the United States and now it\u2019s commonplace. That\u2019s not making America great again.\u201d\nBut legal documents from the foreclosure lawsuit indicate that at least some government officials were well informed that the building was facing significant turmoil.\n\n\u201cThe building is unsecured, which allows non-tenants to access the interior. There has also been increased criminal activity and shootings at the property, which is located across the street from an elementary school, and the current property manager is unable to \u2018re-assert control over the building,\u2019\u201d a legal filing from Wells Fargo stated. \u201cThe City has received reports from (a) tenants\u2019 rights group and the Alderman\u2019s office that conditions continue to worsen at the property.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear whether city officials were aware that federal officials were plotting an operation at the property ahead of time or if they were involved at all in the effort.\nTrinity Flood, attorneys for the landlord, Wells Fargo and representatives of Wells Fargo also did not respond to requests for comment.\nJohn Warren, Chair of Squatters Legislation Task Force for Chicago landlord lobbying group Neighborhood Building Owners Alliance, said he hopes situations like this won\u2019t escalate to such a scale in the future when\na new Illinois law regarding squatters\ntakes effect.\nThe law, which takes effect January 1, allows police to remove \u201csquatters\u201d from residential properties without a court-ordered eviction.\nMeanwhile, the landlord group NBOA advises members to comply with lawfully issued warrants.\n\u201cOur housing providers will always respect a lawfully issued warrant and comply with their legal obligations,\u201d said NBOA president Michael Glasser. \u201cWe want to cooperate with law enforcement in addressing criminal activity while upholding our fundamental responsibility to keep our tenants safe and secure, and to respect their privacy and their rights.\u201d\nThe operation came as immigration enforcement is ramping up rapidly in Chicago, accompanied by protests both downtown and at an immigration detention center in Broadview.\nOn Friday alone, federal agents reportedly deployed tear gas on a residential street in Logan Square and handcuffed and threatened Humboldt Park-area Alderwoman Jessie Fuentes with\u00a0 arrest, Block Club Chicago\nreported\n. Fuentes said she heard the agents brought a suspect to the hospital after he fell while they were chasing him. She said they would not produce a warrant for the man or allow him to speak with attorneys.\nProtestors have also been criticizing ICE for allegedly violating due process in its apprehension of subjects.\nGuidance from the National Apartment Association\nnotes that \u201crenters and their families have a right to privacy and generally do not have to allow ICE into their homes.\u201d\nBut it also goes on to clarify that ICE can receive criminal warrants from a judge in certain circumstances.\nEditor\u2019s note: this post has been updated to properly reflect that Matthew Tarshis was recommended to be a receiver for the property at 7500 South Shore Drive but a judge will determine who to appoint at a later date.",

        "content": "Own a hotel in Los Angeles? Then, you\u2019re probably feeling some pain. Relevant\u2019s Grant King is these days.\nA lender wants to\nsell\nthe equity interests in the Dream Hollywood hotel, owned by a company connected to Relevant. A foreclosure auction is scheduled for mid-October.\nThe lender, LCP Group, alleges Relevant owes more than $30 million in unpaid debt connected to the 10-story, 178-key hotel at 6417 Selma Avenue.\nKing, for his part, said Relevant is working on a loan recapitalization and extension with the lender. If he loses the hotel, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time. The Tommie and Thompson Hollywood hotels \u2014 both sporting different names now \u2014 were under Relevant\u2019s ownership when they went to lenders two years ago.\nKing isn\u2019t the only owner in a jam. Queensgate Investments\ndefaulted\non the debt connected to the Freehand Los Angeles, a hotel-meets-hostel downtown, to the tune of $71 million and too faces foreclosure. The London-based company missed its maturity date for the loan tied to the 226-key hotel at 416 West 8th Street that was once the 13-story, Beaux-Arts-style Commercial Exchange Building.\nAnd, this may only be the beginning, Atlas Hospitality Group\u2019s Alan Reay told\nThe Real Deal\n. Several Los Angeles hoteliers are receiving notice of defaults, and investors are looking at the city with disdain.\nAmong the the pitfalls that are keeping would-be investor out of L.A. is\u00a0 Measure ULA, the so-called \u201cMansion Tax,\u201d that goes beyond mansions and has led to fewer commercial trades, Then there\u2019s homelessness and crime, a related dip in tourism hitting revenue, and a $30 minimum wage for hotel workers in the City of Los Angeles adding to costs.\nAn uncertain economic environment marked with high interest rates is a kicker.\nAdd it up and there\u2019s a new calculus, according to Reay, who says he would have called the Dream Hollywood and the Freehand desirable and well-located a few years ago.\nThings have changed.\nRunning out of time\n\nWe\u2019ve been following the Rockwood Capital-owned Santa Monica Clock Tower for a few months now. Back in May the debt connected to what was once the city\u2019s tallest skyscraper went to\nspecial servicing\n. By July the property saw its\nvalue slashed\nand Rockwood appeared ready to\nsurrender\n.\nFall arrives with Rialto Capital, the special servicer, which acts on behalf of the lender,\nsuing\na company connected to Rockwood, claiming the company defaulted on about $25 million in debt.\nThe special servicer requested a court-appointed receiver to take possession of the 53,500-square-foot, century-old, Art Deco office tower at 225 Santa Monica Boulevard. Rialto wants to foreclose and sell the Santa Monica Clock Tower that is only 43 percent occupied.\nNow to the Valley\nThe Encino Financial Center, a 13-story office building owned by Lowe Enterprises, received a recent reappraisal that reduced its value by almost a third. The downgrade came after its loan landed in special servicing due to imminent monetary default, according to Morningstar Credit and Trepp.\nThe about 230,000-square-foot office building at 16133 Ventura Boulevard is now valued at $48.8 million compared to $72 million at loan issuance in February 2015. That is still more than the $36.9 million debt connected to the property, and according to servicer commentary via Morningstar, modification discussions are ongoing. Lowe, which on its website notes the Encino Financial Center was the first office building the company acquired on its own behalf, declined to comment.\nEarnings season\nEarnings are near. Los Angeles-based, publicly traded, real estate investment trusts Hudson Pacific Properties, Kilroy Realty and Rexford Industrial Realty have announced dates for their third quarter earnings calls in October and November.\nLast quarter, Hudson Pacific\nreported\nan $83 million loss; Kilroy\nreported\nan increase in income to $68 million and announced a $40 million Santa Monica office sale; and Rexford\nreported\nan increase in income to $113 million.\nStay tuned to see how the companies fared through the third quarter.\n",

        "content": "Wall Street\u2019s creep into Texas turned into a stampede of financial institutions bounding into Dallas and\ngrabbing acres of office space in recent years, and the trend has New Yorkers shaking in their Timberlands.\nThe latest back-office clearance\ncame last week, when the Texas Stock Exchange won approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to set up shop, putting it on track to open next year, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. The exchange is temporarily located at 4550 Travis Street in Uptown Dallas and is searching for a long-term headquarters, likely in downtown.\nNone other than the\nNew York Stock Exchange\nand Nasdaq are next, each of those exchanges with regional headquarters planned in Dallas. NYSE chose a traditional office enclave to house the offices of its Texas exchange, taking a lease at Harlan Crow\u2019s Old Parkland in Uptown Dallas,\nThe Real Deal\nfirst reported\nback in June.\nThe cast of big players with a rooting interest in Dallas as a growing center of the financial world looks likely to help. The nation\u2019s largest homebuilder, Arlington-based\nD.R. Horton\n, is among the powerhouses committed to listing on the NYSE Texas exchange.\nA lot of the groundwork has been laid without the fanfare that has accompanied the more recent push for full-blown Y\u2019All Street. Texas already has more\nfinancial services jobs\nthan New York City, the New York Post\nreported\n. Many more are on the way, with Goldman Sachs developing a $500 million office in Uptown and Wells Fargo building a 22-acre campus in Irving\u2019s Las Colinas.\nAnd then there\u2019s JPMorgan Chase, by far the largest bank in the United States, which has more employees in Texas than in its headquarters, New York City. The bank\u2019s Dallas headcount is creeping up on NYC\u2019s with 18,000 employees in Big D compared to 24,000 in the Big Apple.\nDallas-Fort Worth is one of Chase CEO Jamie Dimon\u2019s favorite markets, and he\u2019s been bullish on Texas for years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hospitable. It\u2019s the infrastructure, it\u2019s the education, it\u2019s the taxes. They want business, they support it,\u201d Dimon\ntold\nthe Dallas Morning News in 2023. \u201cIt\u2019s conducive to helping everybody. That\u2019s how you build a healthy, vibrant society. And so we\u2019re urging them here not to become like Washington, D.C., which does almost everything it can to slow down the growth of companies.\u201d\nAs Texas kicks up its heels to Y\u2019all Street, New Yorkers are alarmed.\n\u201cThe financial services industry, they\u2019re our biggest taxpayers and major employers \u2014 and that industry is shrinking in New York,\u201d\u00a0 Kathryn Wylde, president and CEO of the Partnership for New York City\nsaid\non talk radio recently. \u201cThat\u2019s scary.\u201d\nThen again, Chase\u2019s Dimon is about to cut the ribbon on a 2.5 million-square-foot\nheadquarters on Park Avenue\nin Midtown Manhattan, so it\u2019s not exactly a zero-sum game at this point.\n\nUptown rides Y\u2019All Street to biggest office sale\nAnother cause for Dallasites to cheer the arrival of financial firms: Uptown is the epicenter of Y\u2019all Street and Dallas\u2019 hottest office market, out-competing downtown Dallas for top leases, including Bank of America\u2019s 238,000-square-foot lease at KDC\u2019s under construction Parkside Uptown.\nUnion Investment knocked one out of the park with the sale of an office building at 2000 McKinney Avenue in Uptown, the\nbiggest office trade in Dallas\nso far this year. The price for the 21-story, 457,000-square-foot property wasn\u2019t disclosed, but the German investor said it \u201ca significant value increase\u201d to its 2016 purchase price of $226 million, or $500 per square foot. The buyer wasn\u2019t disclosed.\nThat price beats the $218 million price Atlanta-based Cousins Properties\u2019 paid for the Link at Uptown, at 2601 Olive Street, in August. Cousins\u2019 transaction still wins on price per square foot at $747.\nNorthPark takes back ownership\nThe DFW-NYC connection is working out nicely for the Texans of the Nasher-Haemisegger family.\nThe once and future owners of\nNorthPark Center\nin Dallas went to several banks in the Big Apple for a $900 million refinancing deal that buys out a single New York outfit that held a majority stake in the upscale indoor retail center in North Dallas.\nNasher-Haemisigger\u2019s deal includes a two-year, floating-rate CMBS loan from Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. The debt will wipe out $650M in previous debt and allow the family to buy out JPMorgan\u2019s stake in the mall, which has more than 200 stores and restaurants.\nEiseman Jewels recently made a massive investment in the 2.35 million-square-foot mall, and Neiman Marcus is expected to invest in its store there. The mall was developed in 1965 by Ray Nasher.\nIn memoriam\nJoshua Pack\n, the co-CEO of Dallas-based Fortress Investment Group died recently at age 51. Pack joined Fortress, which also has a headquarters in New York, 23 years ago. He was promoted to co-CEO two years ago and had recently relocated from Dallas to London to focus on European expansion. The cause of death wasn\u2019t disclosed.\n",

        "content": "Chicagoland\u2019s luxury real estate market is reaching new peaks.\nMultiple\nbillionaires have now assembled North Shore beachfront estates\nconsisting of multiple homes to extend private shorelines along Lake Michigan.\nEric Lefkofsky\n, the co-founder of Groupon and investor in a handful of other unicorn companies, was the latest member of the 10-figure net worth club to make his footprint even bigger than his already record-setting property on the waterfront.\nWhile his plans for the\nGlencoe home he just bought from his late former neighbor\nfor $8.3 million aren\u2019t yet clear, it adds a substantial chunk of land to his sprawling Glade Road mansion that he bought for $19.5 million back in 2014, the highest price ever paid for a Chicago-area home at the time and one\nseldom surpassed\nsince.\nYet surpassed it was \u2014\nby a longshot\n\u2014 last month in Winnetka, when a still unidentified buyer plunked down over $31 million for a former Goldman Sachs executive\u2019s property to crush the record price for a single-family home in the Chicago area.\nThose deals come on the heels of\nbillionaire Justin Ishbia paying nearly $40 million\nto buy an assemblage of homes on Winnetka\u2019s lakefront so he could tear them down to build a 68,000-square-foot house. The new estate is under construction, at a total cost of at least $77 million including the land.\nWhile the Ishbia deal, and perhaps Lefkofsky\u2019s, are about gaining access to what could be considered blank canvases for development, there\u2019s still a market for\nhistoric properties on the North Shore\n. That came clear with the $11 million sale of a Lake Forest mansion once owned by members of the Armour meatpacking family after it was built in 1912 for John T. Pirie, president of Carson Pirie Scott &amp; Co.\nAre the upper reaches of the North Shore catching up to high-end markets on the nation\u2019s coasts? The Chicago metro isn\u2019t at Manhattan or Westside L.A. levels, but its luxury scene fits with Sunbelt hotspots Dallas and Miami, where\nbigger-ticket deals for waterfront land assemblage\nhave been a force in the market for years.\nOnly time will tell, but this week prolonged a strong stretch for Chicago\u2019s luxury market across various neighborhoods, property types, conditions and price points.\nThere were 15 deals at $4 million-plus, according to online listing services. That number is probably a little higher, as sales sometimes happen off market and aren\u2019t recorded in public records until later.\nIndeed, deals over the $4 million local luxury line ranged from the North Shore to an increasingly well-heeled southwestern Michigan vacation town, and from downtown to the western \u2018burbs, with a stop in Lincoln Park for good measure.\nIn the raw: Unfinished West Loop penthouse brings $5.3M\nAn\nunfinished penthouse in the West Loop\nsold for $5.25 million on Sept. 25, leaving the new owners with a significant build-out project before they can move in.\nThe 5,200-square-foot condo is a raw \u201cshell space\u201d on the top floor of the 16-story Embry West Loop tower at 21 North May Street. Building out the space will likely cost more than $1 million.\nThe buyers, who were not identified, were represented by Julie Busby of Compass. Tim Sheahan and Mark Icuss, also with Compass, represented the developer, Sulo Development.\nThe sale marks a full sell-out for all 58 units in the Embry building. While a high price for the neighborhood, it is not the building\u2019s priciest unit. A penthouse on the 15th floor sold for $7 million in 2023.\nSulo is also the developer behind Hayden, an eight-story, 28-unit condo building at 1109 West Washington Boulevard. It also proposed a three-building, 243-condo project last year at 1325 West Fulton Street.\nTicket to South Haven hideout costs $4M\n\nOn the other end of Lake Michigan in the getaway town of South Haven, Michigan, a sleek modern lakehouse sold for $4 million on Sept. 1. The house has a contemporary, angular design with industrial black siding and large glass windows, draped by a curved roof.\nThe 5,205 square-foot lakefront house with 5 bedrooms and 6.5 bathrooms is only the fourth house in South Haven to sell for $4 million or more in recent years. It came fully furnished, minus some items reserved by the owner.\nThe house was constructed and put up for sale by Anthony Penrose, MLive reported last year. Property records list the buyer as a trust connected to Allison Kouba.\nAndy Klavins of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Michigan Real Estate represented the seller, and Tammy Kerr with Better Homes and Gardens Connections represented the buyer.\nHinsdale mansion pushes boundary of western suburban market at $5.9M\nA Hinsdale mansion\nsold for $5.9 million on Sept. 11\n, securing the highest sale price in the wealthy western suburb in more than a year. The deal for the home at 818 South Elm Street closed in a private transaction after it was initially listed for $7.3 million last year, representing a nearly 20 percent price cut.\nThe seven-bedroom, 16,000-square-foot home sits on a 1.27-acre lot. It was publicly listed in August 2024 before being removed from the market that December. The sale makes it the priciest non-lakefront suburban home to sell in Chicagoland so far this year, aside from a unique Barrington property featured in the TV show \u201cEmpire.\u201d\nColdwell Banker\u2019s\nDawn McKenna\nand Lauren Walz represented the seller on the deal, and\nAlexandra Shaban\nof Jameson Sotheby\u2019s represented the buyer. The seller couldn\u2019t be identified in public records, and information on the buyer was not immediately available.\nWhile it set a high mark for the year, the property is not the most expensive Hinsdale sale on record. Two homes have fetched prices above $7 million in Hinsdale: A 17,600 square-foot mansion sold for a\nrecord $7.7 million in 2021\n, and an off-market sale brought in\n$7.5 million in 2022\n.\nKenilworth mansion found buyer after four years\nAfter four years on the market and major price cuts, a\nKenilworth mansion sold for $6.8 million\non Sept. 11, one of the most expensive sales in the village\u2019s history.\nThe home was last owned by the late Yadelle and Robert Sklare, and their family managed the sale. The long time on the market was in part because the family was in no rush to sell the house, listing agent Nancy Nugent of Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty said.\nIt first hit the private market in 2021 asking $14 million. In 2022, it went public, keeping the $14 million ask. The price dropped five times before its last listing price of $7.7 million in September 2024.\nThe buyers haven\u2019t been identified, but Nugent said they plan to tear down the house and build a new one on the lakefront property.\nCommercial roundup\nThe big commercial real estate news of the week pointed to signs of life in some long-fallow sites eyed for megadevelopments.\nDeveloper\nRelated Midwest, Clayco and a platoon of other partners\nbroke ground on the multi-billion dollar quantum computing facility set to replace the former South Works steel site on Chicago\u2019s South Side.\nBlue Owl\u2019s real estate division\nthat specializes in sale-leaseback transactions was revealed to be involved in financing the land acquisition, as it paid around $75 million to U.S. Steel for the land and subsequently sold a $58 million ground lease deal to the development team led by Related.\nAnd on the North Side, developer\nJim Letchinger\u2019s JDL and Kayne Anderson\nofficially closed on an approximately $84 million acquisition of the northern portion of the former Lincoln Yards site. The deal unlocks a plan focused on residential development, under a new name for the property: Foundry Park. The site\u2019s former developer\nSterling Bay and investment partner Lone Star Funds\nlost the land to their lender Bank OZK after a $125 million default, but Sterling Bay and J.P. Morgan Asset Management have\nretained control of the southern portion\nof the property that was once set to be turned into a $6 billion campus with an emphasis on commercial buildings.",

        "content": "While some artificial intelligence and tech firms in the Bay Area are looking to claw above each other for the top spot,\nSnowflake\nis instead reaching its arms out sideways.\nThe cloud data platform just revamped the top floor of its Menlo Park headquarters into the all-new \u201cSilicon Valley AI Hub,\u201d a 30,000-square-foot space meant to act as a meeting place and water cooler for some of the booming sector\u2019s emerging unicorns. Case in point: One of the first events held in the new space gathered executives from OpenAI, Windsurf and\nGlean\nto share their wisdom on launching an AI startup.\nAn inaugural class of 13 startups will set up shop at the hub over the course of three months, gaining access to coworking space, professional video studios and snacks as well as Snowflake\u2019s computing infrastructure and the company\u2019s investor network. The goal is to host up to 10 events a week at the AI hub, including networking dinners, hackathons and educational sessions. An expansion to add a rooftop restaurant and bar is slated for next year.\nIn the years since the public release of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT in 2022, Snowflake has been beefing up its artificial intelligence capabilities, as well as its own business operations, growing its headcount from 1,000 to 8,000 in the five years since its 2020 IPO and\nsubleasing 773,000-square-foot from Meta\nlast year.\nSnowflake has partnered in the past with OpenAI and Anthropic to integrate their language models in its products. But the new AI hub marks a new chapter for collaboration in the booming sector \u2014 not just between Snowflake and AI companies, but among those specialty AI firms themselves.\nThe move comes as other AI firms across the region also beef up their operations in terms of headcount and office square footage.\nDatabricks\n\u2014 Snowflake\u2019s most direct competitor \u2014 snagged an additional 305,000 square feet in Sunnyvale in July. OpenAI and Anthropic have been on similar tears in San Francisco.\nOpenAI\noccupies approximately 1 million square feet of offices and vowed at the grand opening of its Mission Bay headquarters in March that it plans to double its headcount of 2,000 San Francisco-based employees.\nAnthropic\nlast month added another 100,000 square feet to its headquarters footprint. And AI-powered software company\nPostman\nopened a new 32,367-square-foot headquarters in the Financial District over the summer.\nThe AI sector is driving office demand in the Bay Area as the region stumbles toward post-pandemic recovery. As of last month, office lease demand in San Francisco was up 107 percent year-over-year, according to a recent VTS\nreport\n. Office demand in the city was up more than 350 percent since ChatGPT was first released to the public in late 2022.\nOver the next five years, San Francisco and the Bay Area could see as many as 50,000 to 60,000 new workers in the AI sector move in, experts at CBRE\npredict\n. To accommodate them, AI firms are expected to grow their office footprints from 5 million square feet to more than 20 million.\nSan Jose site trades\nIn more AI-related news, a\nGoodman Group\naffiliate bought land in north San Jose proposed for a data center, a hot asset class thanks to the demand for space to store computer processing units as AI proliferates. The deal with LBA Realty came with a $200 million price tag. The all-cash deal for 350 and 370 West Trimble Road includes 46.8 acres currently housing an office complex and adjacent vacant land. Earlier this year, LBA submitted a development permit to the city of San Jose to build a 207,950-square-foot data center on the site; Goodman Group is known for its work with data centers around the world.\nElsewhere in San Jose, a plot of land in downtown sandwiched between the convention center and Children\u2019s Discovery Museum sold to the city for $13.5 million. BXP offloaded the 3.6-acre parking lot property after plans to build a tech campus complete with offices, retail and housing.\nA spooky buy\nScared by the idea of buying a haunted hotel at a bargain-basement price?\nDon\u2019t be\u2013hotels across the Bay Area\nhave been selling\nat steep discounts in recent years amid a wave of loan defaults, foreclosures and other financial woes.\nThere was, however, something unique about the latest deal, which saw\nHotel Union Square\ngo at bargain. While it was one of several hotels used as temporary shelter during the pandemic, it was just one of two that never reopened its doors to the public afterward.\n\nThat likely helped investor Mahmood Alam snap up the 131 room property for $30 million, a discount of more than a third on the 131-room property at 100-120 Powell Street street.\nThe hotel comes with more than 100 years of history, including the purported ghost of playwright Lillian Hellman, who had frequent dalliances with author Dashiell Hammett in Room 207 during the Prohibition era. In recent years, it operated as temporary residences for the homeless in 2020 and 2021. Rockpoint Group defaulted on its mortgage in 2023 and managers Rockpoint and Highgate Hotels have been searching for a buyer ever since.\nRedco adds another trophy to mantle\nThe\nsale of Wells Fargo\u2019s headquarters\nin downtown San Francisco is finally complete.\nRedco Development closed its purchase of 420 Montgomery Street for $55 million \u2014 more than 85 percent below the building\u2019s pre-pandemic value of $370 million. The offices are mostly vacant after Wells Fargo decamped much of its operations to a 620,000-square-foot lease at 333 Market Street last year.\nRedco was able to move in after housing developer Forge Development Partners got close to buying 420 Montgomery Street for a similar price with plans to convert the building into housing, with the plans ultimately falling apart.\nRedco plans to rebrand the iconic office building as \u201c450 California,\u201d complete with a revamped public-facing lobby with food and beverage tenants including a coffee shop, bar and restaurant. Underground, Redco plans to convert the former bank vault into a speakeasy bar, fitness center, bowling alley and other amenities, while the developer is hoping to bring in a single tenant to lease the upper four floors, including the penthouse.\nRedco now owns nearly two blocks on the California Street corridor after buying 400 Montgomery Street next door to the Wells Fargo building for $25 million and 300 California Street for $28.5 million last year.\nMattson\u2019s lending accomplice under microscope\nOne of Ken Mattson\u2019s lending partners is in the crosshairs of his victims.\nVictims of the disgraced Sonoma developer-turned-alleged-fraudster have trained their sights on\nSocotra Capital\n, the Sacramento-based firm that provided Mattson\u2019s businesses with more than 100 loans totaling more than $180 million. Socotra holds liens on 75 properties linked to Mattson.\nDefrauded investors haven\u2019t filed a lawsuit against the lender directly \u2014 yet.\nMatt Treger, who claims to have gotten scammed after investing with Mattson over 15 years, cites Scotra\u2019s own website as a red flag.\n\u201cFrom Socotra\u2019s website, they proclaim, \u2018We\u2019re not like your conventional lenders with strict parameters, slow turnarounds, and unnecessary hoops to jump through,\u2019\u201d Matt Treger, who invested with Mattson over more than 15 years,\ntold\nthe Press Democrat. \u201cAs someone whose life savings has been swallowed up, their business model seems clear evidence that parameters and hoops are an essential part of a just system.\u201d\n\u201cMy hope is that, as an investor group, we pursue every avenue to determine accountability and recompense,\u201d Treger added.\nThe latest accusations against Socotra come a month after Mattson,\nout on $4 million bail\n,\ncrashed his car into a fence and tree\nin Sonoma. The Press Democrat\nreported\nthis week that he was unconscious when authorities arrived on the scene. Notably, in the year leading up to his arrest, Mattson reportedly sold off 40 classic cars to the tune of nearly $3 million, though his lawyers\npleaded this summer\nfor relief from selling off additional other vehicles.\n",

        "content": "Rankings\nand superlatives are probably the one thing agents and brokerages can agree they love to hate and then love again.\nMost are unable to look away from perusing said rankings even if they take issue with the methodology.\nWith the Los Angeles County ranking for this year\u2019s top agents and teams now complete, the list may be as close to a reflection of the high end of the market one can get. That statement doesn\u2019t gloss over the common complaints heard each year from some in the industry, most notably that the list throws teams and solo agents into the same ring.\nTo be fair, it\u2019s not an apples to apples comparison when, for example, a 15-person team\u2019s production is going up against the business of an agent that operates solo. However, the market\u2019s housing inventory isn\u2019t siphoned off into buckets of what can be bought and sold by a team or a single agent.\nAll that said, the Williams &amp; Williams Estate Group, helmed by Branden and Rayni Williams, took the No. 1 spot on this year\u2019s list with about $1.3 billion in production and 197 deals.\nKurt Rappaport\n, co-founder of Westside Estate Agency, ranked No. 5 overall but if we were only counting single agents, he\u2019d rank at the top with $568 million dollars closed across the 19 deals he handled, and lead on median price, too.\nLack of context\nSpeaking of superlatives, a Redfin report found the sale of Rick Caruso\u2019s former home at 912 Benedict Canyon Drive to be the U.S.\u2019s priciest deal in\nAugust\n.\nThe property sold for\n$47.5 million\n, although the designation of \u201cpriciest\u201d lacked market context beyond the month of August, the traditional dog days for residential sales.\nFor example, within Los Angeles County, the most expensive home sales to date in 2025 were two properties that each sold for $110 million: 630 Nimes Road in Bel-Air and 594 South Mapleton Drive in Holmby Hills.\nAgainst the backdrop of the broader U.S. residential market, Nimes Road and Mapleton Drive are tied for second place after the\n$225 million sale\nof a three-address, 15-acre compound in Naples, Florida.\nThe April sale consisted of 2170, 2200 and 2340 Gordon Drive and is now the second-most expensive residential sale in U.S. history.\nAll that to say, awarding superlatives based on the timespan of a week or month doesn\u2019t always offer the clearest view of much of anything.\n\nNavigating Measure ULA\nThe rankings and records indicate that agents in Los Angeles are still closing deals even with what some liken to a big wet rag on business in the form of\nMeasure ULA\n.\nThe two-tiered tax on all property \u2014 commercial and residential \u2014 went into effect in April 2023 and currently assesses a 4 percent fee on deals starting at $5.3 million or 5.5 percent on $10.6 million or more.\nRayni Williams, CEO and co-founder of the Beverly Hills Estates, called ULA the \u201cbiggest detriment\u201d for the market currently.\nThat\u2019s \u201cmore than interest rates. More than world events,\u201d she added.\nOthers see things differently and have largely accepted the tax as a cost of doing business.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to accept it\u2019s there, otherwise what can we do?\u201d said David Berg of Smith &amp; Berg Partners at Compass. \u201cWe can yell and scream about it and hope that there\u2019s a solution that comes along. Maybe it\u2019s repealed, but essentially, it\u2019s a fact of life at this point for what we do.\u201d\nRecommended reading\nTRD\ntagged along with Amalfi Estates founder Anthony Marguleas in the\nPacific Palisades\nlast month.\nThe ride along offered not only a sense of what it\u2019s like to do business in the community, but also on the progress that\u2019s been made in the Pacific Palisades since January\u2019s fire.\nA subsequent visit back noted a steady stream of dine-in and to-go business from construction workers and locals at the Palisades Garden Caf\u00e9. Construction equipment sat parked at Rick Caruso\u2019s Palisades Village on the other side of Sunset Boulevard, where a group of suits walked around the retail center, which remains under repair in the wake of the blaze.\nThe split-screen along Sunset illustrated that there\u2019s still plenty of work ahead,\u00a0but construction on residential lots is becoming increasingly common as the community moves forward.\n",

        "content": "Developers and brokers are bullish on South Florida. Talk of a recession is unwarranted, they say. What about a housing bubble? Also unlikely.\nMiami\u2019s perpetual optimism helps mask some of the issues that we\u2019ve been reporting on.\nIn\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s\ncover story\n, I took a macro look at the real estate market in South Florida and the red flags that may be clouding the region\u2019s future.\nA lot is going well, and an abundance of industry pundits are available to speak to that. The wealth migration continues, and construction crews are showing up to work every day. But many challenges also have plagued developers for years. Condo sales slowed, construction, insurance and debt are all too expensive. Projects require more equity. And some sectors are experiencing longer, stronger pauses than others.\nCondo developers have had to secure more equity at a time when equity is lacking, one capital markets broker told me. We reported this summer that many multifamily developers sitting on land are looking to sell their sites, and demand for spec office space has dried up. Retail is still doing well.\nAnd restaurants had to endure a tough summer. Many closed.\nOne thing that I\u2019ve noticed in conversations with sources and publicists is that developers and real estate agents are cutting back on their marketing budgets. They\u2019re re-engineering projects to save money, even if they have already sold those units. Companies have stopped hiring, or pulled back on hiring.\nAffordability is playing a big role in the region\u2019s economy because the gap between the haves and the have-nots has grown tremendously.\nLate last month, UBS released its housing bubble report, which looks at price to income, price to rent and prices compared to the national average. At the top? Miami. If only the wealthy can afford to live here, that will have a big effect on the region in the long term.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nHistorian Marvin Dunn alleges in a new lawsuit that Miami Dade College violated Sunshine Laws in\napproving land\nfor a potential Trump Presidential Library without public input. The site could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. What do you think, and how does this end? Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\n\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential\n: Deborah Ann Robinson, a novelist and the widow of Edward J. Robinson, chief financial officer of RJR Nabisco, parted with a single-family home at 217 Clarke Avenue in Palm Beach for $30 million. The buyer was Southern Mark LLC, a Delaware-registered company reportedly tied to Winifred \u201cWinnie\u201d Johnson Marquart, heir to the SC Johnson fortune.\nCommercial\n:\nTishman Speyer acquired\na 270-unit apartment complex at 5500 Broken Sound Boulevard Northwest and 950 Northwest Broken Sound Parkway in Boca Raton for $124.5 million. The seller of the complex, known as the Bell at Broken Sound Apartments, was Greensboro, North Carolina-based Bell Partners.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nAn oceanfront estate in Manalapan hit the market for $75 million. The ocean-to-lake compound at\n640 South Ocean Boulevard\nwas built in 2020. The nearly 17,000-square-foot mansion has 11 bedrooms, six and a half bathrooms, a gym, spa, bar and lounge, two boat lifts, a guard house and a guest house, according to the listing. Casey Flannery of Equestrian Sotheby\u2019s International Realty has the listing. The property is owned by a trust, and it was on the market last year for $85 million. It sold in 2020 for $36 million.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nFlorida\u2019s Treasure Coast is living up to its name. A shipwreck salvage company recovered more than\n1,000 silver and gold coins\nvalued at about $1 million from an 18th-century shipwreck. The treasure is allegedly part of gold, silver and jewels lost by the Spanish fleet during a hurricane more than 200 years ago.\nElsewhere in Florida\nAs lawyers duke it out in court over the future of Alligator Alcatraz, the Trump administration awarded Florida $608 million for the state\u2019s immigrant detention efforts, the\nNews Service of Florida reports\n. The money will come from the $150 billion that Congress awarded to the Federal Emergency Management Agency this year.\nFlorida regulators will open hearings Monday on Florida Power &amp; Light\u2019s revised $7 billion rate hike, down from its original $9.8 billion proposal, according to\nFlorida Phoenix\n. Critics called FPL\u2019s original proposal the largest utility rate increase in U.S. history, and the latest proposal would still grant FPL a return on equity above the national average.\nA grand jury in Tallahassee will hear testimony this month as part of a criminal probe into the Hope Florida Foundation, a charity led by First Lady Casey DeSantis, after revelations that $10 million from a state settlement was funneled into a political committee tied to Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 chief of staff, the\nMiami Herald\nreports.",

        "content": "Nail-polish money provided the gloss for the biggest condominium sale in Los Angeles County in the first half of the year, with former OPI nail polish executive Miriam Schaeffer paying $39.1 million purchase of a full-floor penthouse in Century City, according to Los Angeles County tax assessor records. The January deal at The Century also marks the county\u2019s\nmost expensive condo trade\nin at least the past three years, as\nThe Real Deal\nreported.\nThis is the latest installment in a feature providing a weekly update on top sales by market segment, based on TRDData for given periods. You can see the top 10 condo sales for the first half of the year by clicking\nhere\n.\nThe seller \u2014 represented by Douglas Elliman\u2019s Bachir Oueida \u2014 was Vicki Walters, who listed the property at 1 West Century Drive for $50 million in 2023, according to the\nWall Street Journal\n. Her late husband, Raul Walters, was a real estate developer who built and financed early Walmart stores. Walters paid $22.5 million for the residence in 2015, property records show.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Jacob Dadon negotiated on behalf of Schaeffer, whose ex-husband founded OPI.\n\nThe 9,400-square-foot unit, which went for $4,153 per square foot, includes three bedrooms and seven bathrooms. Touches include hand-painted 22-karat gold leaf on the ceiling and 11-foot projector screens. The apartment also comes with a 500-square-foot studio, a pool cabana, a separate 1,200-square-foot office suite and four parking spaces.\nOther high-profile deals in the Robert AM Stern-designed building include Candy Spelling \u2014 widow of Aaron Spelling \u2014 buying a penthouse unit for $35 million in 2010, and singer Rihanna\nselling\nher condo in 2024 for $20.8 million\na year after acquiring it\nfor $21 million. Rihanna\u2019s unit was once owned by the late \u201cFriends\u201d star Matthew Perry.\nSchaeffer, whose fortune tracks to the OPI nail-polish brand founded by her now ex-husband, is an active player in the L.A. County high-end residential real estate market.\nIn September 2024 she sold the Malibu carbon neutral residence named\nZero One\nat 11865 Ellice Street for $25 million. She acquired the 4,300-square-foot\n31048 Broad Beach Road\nin Malibu in 2023 for $35 million. And she spent roughly $51 million in 2021 across three purchases for properties in Los Angeles, Malibu and Hidden Hills.\n",

        "content": "A group of Dream Town agents in Chicago has moved over to Compass, notching a win for the national firm as it chases growth in Chicago\u2019s market.\nJoey Halperin, David Schatz and Chris Sweitzer joined Compass on Sept. 29 as the principals of their new team, Terra Group. They brought along Megan O\u2019Carroll, Dana Noureldin, Riley Callahan and Daniel Banys, all previously members of the Halperin Schatz team at Dream Town, which is owned by independent brokerage Baird &amp; Warner.\nAll seven agents have worked at Compass in the past, and Halperin said the return to Compass was a \u201cfull circle\u201d moment for the team.\nThe move is further evidence of competition for agents and market share between Compass and the remaining Chicago brokerages that aren\u2019t affiliated with the real estate behemoth. Compass announced its plan to\nmerge with Anywhere Real Estate last month\n, which would bring some of the city\u2019s biggest brokerages under its banner. It purchased Chicago\u2019s largest brokerage, @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, last year.\nThe purchase of @properties left Baird &amp; Warner, which\nacquired Dream Town earlier this year\n, as the largest independent brokerage in Chicago. Baird &amp; Warner president and CEO Steve Baird said in an earlier interview with\nThe Real Deal\nthat he sees the consolidation as an opportunity to grow Baird &amp; Warner and pick up more agents as mergers disrupt the brokerage space.\nPeter Cummins, a longtime @properties agent on the North Shore recently moved to Baird &amp; Warner,\nciting opposition to consolidation\nand private exclusive listings as his reason for the move.\nBut the move back to Compass by these agents gives weight to Compass\u2019 bet that its deep agent network, technology platforms and exclusive listing strategy will attract more agents.\n\nThe members of the new Compass team made a combined $55 million in sales in the last 12 months, Sweitzer said. The team has a focus on selling new development, with about 60 to 70 percent of the agents\u2019 business being in new construction, Schatz said. Sweitzer also focuses on investment properties.\nHalperin said access to Compass\u2019 private exclusives is a plus, especially in new developments. Compass has been pushing a three-phase marketing strategy, where some properties begin as private exclusives marketed only to Compass agents. The company says the strategy offers sellers more freedom and privacy and helps them test pricing before their house hits the open market.\nZillow and many of Compass\u2019 competitors, like Baird &amp; Warner, have\nopposed the trend toward private exclusive\nlistings, arguing they distort the market for consumers and are anti-competitive.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the basketball player where you hate to play against him but you love when you\u2019re on the team,\u201d Halperin said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that, when we weren\u2019t on the team, we didn\u2019t necessarily love, but now that we\u2019re on the team, it\u2019s giving our clients an advantage.\u201d\nBeyond the initial group of seven, the team\u2019s principals said they hope to attract more agents going forward.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to be able to scale a team quite well and bring a really strong group of like-minded individuals together and make a really, really solid team,\u201d Sweitzer said.\n",

        "content": "The CRE loans hitting the auction block in Texas this month dipped slightly despite warnings of an\nimminent wave of multifamily distress\n.\nThis month will see $575 million in loans at the auction block across the Texas Triangle, down from\n$710 million in September\nand\n$670 million in August\n, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service.\nHarris County, home to Houston, was once again the hardest hit, with 11 properties totaling nearly $270 million in debt facing foreclosure.\nHere are the biggest loans up for auction this month. It\u2019s possible that some of these borrowers and lenders will reach agreements to avoid auction.\nHouston\nThe largest CRE loan debuting on the auction block in Houston this month is a $42 million mortgage tied to the 265-unit Adenine Apartments. Unlike most of the multifamily properties facing foreclosure in Harris County, this one is relatively new, built in 2016. Madera Residential, which is based in Lubbock, bought the apartment complex, at 1755 Wyndale Street, in 2023. The debt is a collateralized loan structured by Prime Finance Partners. It works out to $158,490 per unit.\nSan Antonio\nTroubled investor Alan Stalcup and his firm GVA\nare facing foreclosure on Barcelo Apartments, a 288-unit apartment complex at 3501 Pin Oak Drive in San Antonio. CBRE Multifamily provided the $30.5 million mortgage. The debt on the property, built in 1972, works out to $106,000 per unit.\nDallas\nArbor Realty is foreclosing on Parea Oak Lawn, at 4503 Lake Avenue. Lakewood, New Jersey-based\nSun Equity Partners\nis the owner. The $25.5 million mortgage on the 131-unit property built in 1970 works out to $194,656 per unit.\nFort Worth\n\nThe loan tied to Arioso Apartments &amp; Townhomes is supposed to hit the auction block this month. A Rialto Real Estate fund provided the $56 million mortgage for the 288-unit property at 3030 Claremont Drive in Grand Prairie. Ed Monce\u2019s IMH Companies bought the property in 2022. It was built in 2007, and the debt works out to $194,000 per unit.\nRepeat offenders\nOf the 11 foreclosures in Houston\u2019s Harris County, six properties are regulars. They\u2019ve received multiple foreclosure notices but haven\u2019t been sold yet. The list includes multiple properties owned by Rao Polavarapu\u2019s Falls Apartment Group, which had a loan head to special servicing in August.\nFalls of Braeburn, a 191-unit complex at 9707 Braeburn Glen ($64.5 million);\nThe Selena Apartments, a 446-unit complex at 250 Uvalde Road ($37.9 million).\nFalls of Las Villas, a 466-unit complex at 407 Richey Street, and Falls of Alta Vista, a 514-unit complex at 621 Richey Street ($33.5 million);\nFalls of Westpark, a 356-unit complex at 6130 Southwest ($29 million); and\nThe Sophia Apartments, a 240-unit complex at 11500 Green Plaza ($17.9 million).\nTwo properties in Bexar County are headed to the block a second time:\nOne Technology Center, a 196,000-square-foot office building, at 7411 John Smith Avenue ($57.75 million); and\nAviator at Brooks, a 280-unit apartment complex at 8010 Aeromedical Road ($33.9 million).\nTravis County will see one repeat customer at the auction block this month:\nGalleria Oaks Building 2, an 18,000-square-foot retail strip at 13376 North U.S. Highway 183 ($16 million).\nAs will Dallas County:\nThree Forest Drive, a 367,000-square-foot office building, at 12221 Merit Street ($57.75 million).\n",

        "content": "New York City authorities are claiming a win in their push to enforce standards on landlords after\nMeyer Chetrit\u2019s indictment\non felony charges of tenant harassment.\nThe action is an escalation of city enforcement actions against landlords, who are largely subject to administrative penalties and rarely face criminal charges.\n\u201cFor folks who are following the law, this evens the playing field,\u201d said Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. \u201cOur hope is that the industry would be supportive of this kind of alleged conduct being rooted out.\u201d\nChetrit has been charged with two counts of harassment of a rent-regulated tenant, a felony that carries a maximum sentence of four years in prison.\nChetrit, through defense attorney Jeffrey Chartier, denied the allegations.\nBragg cited Chetrit\u2019s track record of poor conditions at his properties that persist after penalties and inquiries from the Department of Buildings and Loft Board. That gives the case evidence, but it also means that criminal sanctions are the appropriate next step, he said.\nBringing a criminal case to trial can be a deterrent to the cost-benefit analyses landlords make about administrative penalties, according to Jocelyn Strauber, Department of Investigations commissioner.\n\u201cWe suspect there\u2019s more conduct like this out there, which we will be looking for,\u201d Strauber said.\nMaking the case\nAshley Viruet, deputy director at Legal Services of New York City, said tenant harassment is still quite common in New York, and something tenants\u2019 attorneys see often. A one-off prosecution, she said, may not be enough to curb bad behavior.\n\u201cI appreciate that they\u2019re trying to put landlords on notice,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not entirely sure that it\u2019s going to change behaviors.\u201d\nAlthough Chetrit is facing potential prison time, that result would be something of a first for New York. There has not been a high-profile case where a landlord has served in prison specifically for tenant harassment.\nOther landlords who have tangled with law enforcement have either avoided time in state prison so far or have been sent there for other crimes.\nDaniel Ohebshalom was jailed at Rikers Island\nlast year for his refusal to fix deteriorating conditions at two Washington Heights buildings even after court orders. Last May, Ohebshalom was indicted on charges of tenant harassment and accused of filing false documents with the city.\nIn 2022, landlord Raphael Toledano was banned from real estate activity\nin New York for five years after he violated an agreement with the state to stop harassing tenants.\n\nSteve Croman, once named among the worst landlords in the city, faced a civil suit from the state for tenant harassment, which he\nsettled for $8 million in restitution in 2017\n. (He was\nsentenced to state prison in 2017\n, but for mortgage and tax fraud.)\n\u201cHistorically, the D.A.\u2019s office has wanted some kind of financial crime as kind of the linchpin to hold it all together,\u201d said Viruet, who is part of the team representing tenants of Ohebshalom in housing court.\nThere are other divisions in New York that come after landlords for tenant harassment, said Sherwin Belkin, a landlord-side real estate attorney and founding partner at Belkin Burden Goldman. But rarely do accusations to rise to the criminal level.\n\u201cProsecution for criminal harassment is a serious matter,\u201d Belkin said. \u201cI assume it\u2019s being taken very seriously by Mr. Chetrit and his attorneys.\u201d\nThe\ndistrict attorney alleged Chetrit\nallowed conditions in 111-117 West 26th Street to deteriorate, leaving the two senior citizens without heat or, in some cases, an elevator.\nThe tenants have special protection because they are in rent-stabilized apartments overseen by the city\u2019s loft board.\nChartier, Chetrit\u2019s defense attorney, cast doubt on the facts of the case, alleging that one of the two senior citizens is not a true resident of the building.\n\u201cRather than prosecute violent criminals that are plaguing the city, Bragg has again chosen to misapply the law in pursuit of a progressive political agenda,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s not the first time tenants have raised concerns about conditions in buildings associated with Chetrit.\nElected officials on the Upper West Side have raised alarms about\nChetrit\u2019s management of the Park West Village\non Columbus Avenue between West 97th and 100th streets. Tenants there have accused Chetrit of pocketing city rent subsidies without crediting them to renters\u2019 accounts, and then pursuing eviction.\nState Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal launched a confidential survey to determine the scope of the problem.\n\u201cMeyer Chetrit\u2019s indictment echoes the pattern of harassment and mismanagement that tenants in my district have reported for years under his management,\u201d Hoylman-Sigal said in a statement to\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cNo landlord should take taxpayer funds, bill tenants twice, and leave people in unsafe homes.\u201d\nRent-stabilized tenants at\n496 Metropolitan Avenue in Brooklyn\naccused an entity associated with Chetrit of abandoning the building. About one-third of the tenants filed a petition against the building owner in March, alleging dangerous conditions, harassment and retaliatory eviction. The building\u2019s lender has also brought a commercial foreclosure case on the building.\nThe city of Cleveland sued the Chetrits\u2019 family firm in 2023\nover conditions at three buildings\nin the city after tenants complained of broken elevators, malfunctioning heat, and negligent security. The city was seeking a receiver for the properties, but the parties have since proposed a buyer for the buildings, which would end the case.\nChetrit and associated parties are facing multiple civil suits from lenders, including several foreclosure actions. Maverick Real Estate Partners has\naccused Chetrit of fraudulently transferring money\nto shield assets from a $132 million judgment. His lawyers have denied the allegations.\n",

        "content": "The Live Local Act is incentivizing some developers to add affordable housing units with below-market rents to buildings that are already under construction or completed, instead of doing so at the pre-approval stage of development, according to a panel of speakers at the Urban Land Institute\u2019s Fort Lauderdale Forum.\nFor example, the developer of The Arcadian, a 502-unit apartment project in Fort Lauderdale, is in the process of designating some of the apartments as affordable housing units under the state\u2019s\nLive Local Act\n, which encourages the development of rental housing with below-market rents. The developer is Fort Lauderdale-based Fuse Group Investment Companies.\nConstruction of phase one of\nThe Arcadian\nwill be completed by the end of the year, panel member Eyal Peretz, founder of Fuse Group, said during a panel discussion of the Live Local Act at the ULI event last week. The Arcadian \u201cstarted as a non-Live Local project and went through some transformation, and we are going through a process right now where we are about to submit [it as] a Live Local project,\u201d Peretz said.\nAs elevated interest rates and construction costs slow residential development, the Live Local Act\u2019s incentives can make marginal projects more profitable, panelists said. The Live Local Act\u2019s incentives to developers to offer affordable and workforce housing include property tax breaks on apartments with below-market rents.\n\u201cEvery project we\u2019re looking at, we\u2019re looking at adding a Live Local component to it,\u201d said panelist Doron Broman, founder and CEO of Miami-based Moderno Development Group.\u00a0 \u201cMost projects don\u2019t pencil in today. So, with the Live Local Act that gives you additional income, that means, maybe, the project will pencil in.\u201d\n\nModerno started construction of Rivr Lofts, a 29-story, 352-unit apartment building in Fort Lauderdale, in 2022, prior to enactment of the Live Local Act. Construction is complete, and \u201cwe are looking right now at converting some of the units into the Live Local pool,\u201d Broman said. \u201cThe smaller studios seem to be a very good fit for that type of product.\u201d\nThe availability of Live Local units at Rivr Lofts would be limited to people who collect up to 120 percent of area median income. \u201cSo, we\u2019re talking about aiming units at people making around $90,000 a year,\u201d Broman said. \u201cA lot of our residents already fit that criteria, so it\u2019s worthwhile for us to lower the rent a little bit more and get the tax benefit.\u201d\nNot all residential developments are feasible as Live Local projects because blending market-rate apartments and below-market rate apartments in a mixed-income building is difficult, said panelist\nRussell Galbut\n, managing principal of Crescent Heights.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a small percentage, and that\u2019s because you have 60 percent of your building that has to pay for the other 40 percent,\u201d Galbut said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work in paper and pencil, it will never work in brick and mortar.\u201d\nGalbut said the biggest benefit of the state\u2019s Live Local Act is \u201cprompt and professional\u201d municipal approval of developments with affordable housing without a time-consuming review by a planning and zoning board or a city commission. \u201cTime kills many great projects,\u201d he said.\nMany lenders are hesitant to finance construction of mixed-income residential developments under the Live Local Act , Peretz said. \u201cWe see an issue with financing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping it\u2019s going to change \u2026. But I\u2019ve been hearing from a lot of developers with issues on that side of things.\u201d\u201cIt seems we need to get everybody on the same page and make sure \u2026 our cash flow matches with what the lenders are expecting,\u201d said Alfonso Costa Jr., chief operating officer of\nFalcone Group\nand moderator of the panel discussion. \u201cWorking with the takeout agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on takeouts, and then HUD as well, both on the new construction and takeout side, it\u2019s more of an educational process.\u201d",

Archer\u2019s air taxis will purportedly offer 10- to 20-minute flights between SoFi Stadium, LAX and various hubs from Santa Monica to Orange County.\nThe goal is to divert passengers from busy surface roads \u201cwhere it should take 30 minutes to get from point A to point B, but it takes an hour and a half,\u201d VertiPorts by Atlantic CEO Kevin Cox told the Times. \u201cSouthern California area has got a lot of challenges in terms of congestion on the roadway.\u201d\nAs for where the vertiports could be created across Southern California, Cox predicted we will see \u201ctwo or three dozen scattered around the market that will truly transform how people move through and between cities.\u201d Santa Monica, downtown L.A. and Culver City, then, could be prime targets.\nThose worried about safety shouldn\u2019t fret, as professional pilots will be charged with flying the eVTOL vehicles, not everyday people like George Jetson.\n\nStill, because eVTOLs are such a new technology, there are no FAA regulations on how they can be used.\n\u201cThe real challenge for these is getting local land use entitlements,\u201d Mike Condon Jr., a commercial property broker with Cushman &amp; Wakefield, told the Times. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere in zoning codes that says how flying taxis can take off.\u201d\nAtlantic Aviation already operates a network of private plane terminals at airports across the countries, with more than 100 across North America including at LAX,\nSanta Monica Airport\n, Hollywood Burbank Airport and Long Beach Airport. Those could eventually also double as eVTOL takeoff and landing sites.\n\u201cWe expect a lot of travel will start from those,\u201d Condon said. \u201cLeave from the airport and don\u2019t fight traffic.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The 68-year-old is expected to remain in jail until the court\u2019s adjournment concludes in a little more than a month.\nSolny was sentenced to five years of probation in 2019 after pleading guilty to possession of stolen property. He allegedly violated that probation within months after committing another deed theft.\nThis summer, Solny was convicted of stealing 11 homes. He was allowed to be free ahead of his sentencing in the case, which is expected to unfold in Brooklyn this month.\nIt appears Solny wasn\u2019t expecting to be taken to jail when he attended his probation hearing, since he did not have his medicine for high blood pressure in hand, according to one of his lawyers. He added that it was insensitive for him to be taken into custody directly before Yom Kippur.\n\nSolny was known to lure owners in by offering to arrange a short sale, where owners in financial distress sell their home under lender-approved terms for less than they owe on their mortgage. In return, the lender drops the foreclosure action and forgives the balance of the mortgage. After the short sale, however, Solny\u2019s victims \u2014 often Black or Latino families \u2014 would emerge still carrying debt.\nSolny would also tell homeowners that lenders required them to vacate a property for a short sale to occur. They would vacate and he would transfer the deed to himself and start collecting rent on existing tenants or those he brought in.\nWhen the tricked owners would ask what was happening with the sale, he would allegedly tell them negotiations were pending.\nDeed theft is challenging to prosecute, as intent needs to be shown and victims typically sign legally-binding documents, allowing perpetrators to frame schemes as legal business deals.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "You won\u2019t find a more pro-housing politician in the city than Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso. But you wouldn\u2019t know it from his appointee on the City Planning Commission.\nJuan Osorio has repeatedly voted against major housing initiatives.\nLast year, Osorio\nopposed\nCity of Yes for Economic Opportunity \u2014 the only one of the 13 commissioners to do so. But he was just getting warmed up.\nSix months later, he\nvoted against\nthe City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, which at the time was estimated to create 110,000 homes. The City Council later whittled it down to 82,000.\nThis year, Osorio has\nvoted no\non rezonings of Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, Midtown South in Manhattan and downtown Jamaica in Queens, which together should spur 27,000 new homes. The three initiatives passed by a combined vote of 33-5. Only Public Advocate Jumaane Williams\u2019 appointee, self-described Marxist\nLeah Goodridge\n, voted with Osorio.\nIn a moment of weakness, Osorio did vote for the Bronx Metro-North Station Area rezoning, which is projected to add 7,000 units. But otherwise, Reynoso\u2019s representative has been on a rejection rampage.\nOsorio\u2019s remarks at Planning Commission meetings indicate he\u2019s on a quixotic quest for perfection. He wants every conceivable impact studied, not a single manufacturing job displaced and rents affordable to anyone with two nickels to rub together.\nThis kind of thinking is\nWhy Nothing Works\n, as Marc Dunkelman\u2019s new book by that title explains. The author is among many thought leaders urging fellow liberals to prioritize results over process and protectionism.\nOsorio hasn\u2019t gotten the message.\nThe problem with creating fantastically affordable apartments on paper is they don\u2019t materialize in bricks and mortar. The problem with studying everything to death is nothing gets done. The problem with zoning to protect jobs is they inevitably vanish anyway and new ones can\u2019t move in.\nTake the Midtown South rezoning. Osorio\ncast the only \u201cno\u201d vote\n, saying that in a \u201cworst-case scenario,\u201d 5,300 jobs would be displaced from the Garment District.\nAn environmental impact statement had deemed that possible result insignificant. In a borough with 4 million daily workers, a rezoning that displaces 0.1 percent of them in 15 years is hardly a job-killer.\n\u201cBut these are New Yorkers,\u201d Osorio said of the 5,300 hypothetical displacements, \u201cwho rely on these jobs to be able to afford housing in the city.\u201d\nAs a former senior planner at the Municipal Art Society, Osorio must know the Garment District\u2019s manufacturing zoning was preserved for decades by well-meaning politicians, yet nearly all of its textile jobs relocated or disappeared anyway. Buildings aged and emptied out.\nHad the city rezoned long ago, billions more dollars would have been invested in Midtown South real estate, replacing those lost jobs and then some.\nOsorio made the same argument about manufacturing jobs when he\nvoted against the Jamaica rezoning\n, which is expected to create 12,000 homes, including 4,000 affordable.\n\nI get the need for some manufacturing in the city, which is why Mayor Mike Bloomberg carved out Industrial Business Zones. But, pre-Bloomberg, ample industrial zoning did not stop the number of manufacturing jobs from plunging from 1 million to 157,000 in half a century.\nToday,\njust over 50,000\nremain. Osorio\u2019s insistence on saving every one makes no sense in a world where technology constantly improves, destroying some jobs and creating others.\nThe city must ensure zoning allows for this evolution. There will be losers, yes, but far more winners. Omelets can\u2019t be made without breaking eggs.\nReynoso agrees with Osorio on industrial policy. The borough president believes the city could create enough housing in residential areas without touching manufacturing districts.\n\u201cFifty percent of Brooklyn hasn\u2019t built any housing since 1968,\u201d he said in a phone interview, citing Sheepshead Bay, Bay Ridge and Canarsie as among the laggards.\nBut the politics of upzoning there are difficult. The city can\u2019t rely on southern Brooklyn and eastern Queens to create the\n500,000 homes it needs\n.\nReynoso does differ with his appointee, Osorio, on some things. The borough president endorsed City of Yes, urging its housing goals be expanded, not shrunk by rent caps.\n\u201cWe need to be realistic about what City of Yes for Housing Opportunity is and what it is not,\u201d he said last year. \u201cIt is not an affordability strategy.\u201d\nTwo months later, his appointee\nvoted against it\n, citing \u201cthe lack of affordability mandates.\u201d\nLater, Osorio said the low-rent units mandated by Mandatory Inclusionary Housing were not enough for the Atlantic Avenue and Jamaica rezonings.\nWhen I asked Reynoso if Osorio had gone rogue, the borough president said his appointees are independent. \u201cI don\u2019t have any puppets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mayor\u2019s appointees are all rubber stampers. What Osorio is doing is making the Department of City Planning work. He\u2019s challenging them to do better.\u201d\nBut Osorio is making the perfect the enemy of the good. If every planning commissioner were like him, the city would spend even more time studying impacts, protecting jobs and freezing rents \u2014 and getting even less housing built.\nThis is the recipe for failure that Dunkelman and\nother progressives\nare urging the left to abandon. Reynoso appears to be listening.\n\u201cThe progressives are leading the pro-housing movement,\u201d he said. \u201cThe progressives used to be the problem. They were scared of gentrification. But we got new data.\u201d\nYet Reynoso\u2019s appointee keeps asking for more. It\u2019s classic paralysis by analysis \u2014 a demand for Utopia that will never achieve it.\nWe got new data. What they show is we don\u2019t need more data. We need more housing.\n",

        "content": "L&amp;L Holding Company and Columbia Property Trust have landed two large retail tenants at their Terminal Warehouse office and retail redevelopment in West Chelsea.\nEquinox\ninked a 50,000-square-foot long-term lease across the lower three floors of the full-block development at 261 11th Avenue,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned. The asking rent and lease length are unknown.\nMeanwhile, Convene Hospitality Group inked a 50,000-square-foot lease across the same three floors in a different section of the historic building, where it will open an event space called The Mallory. The name is a nod to the original architect of the 1890s building, George Mallory, the company said in a press release.\nOffice tenants will have access to the lounge and conference center, which are slated to open next year. The CHG deal was first reported by the\nNew York Post\n.\nEquinox and CHG are the first new retail tenants since the\n$1.8 billion transformation\nof the late-19th-century 1.3-million-square-foot landmark warehouse into offices, retail space, food and beverage areas as well as other indoor and outdoor amenities. Both will be accessible from the building\u2019s 700-foot tunnel, which was originally used by freight trains shuttling goods between the Hudson River and the railroad system.\nThe building, which is nearing completion, will have 12 floors of office space around a central courtyard.\n\nNewmark\u2019s Jeff Roseman represented Equinox. CBRE\u2019s Rocco Laginestra represented CHG. A Cushman &amp; Wakefield team including Alan Schmerzler, Catherine Merck and Sean Moran represented the landlord in both deals.\nA representative for the landlord declined to comment on the Equinox lease. Equinox did not respond to requests for comment.\nL&amp;L and Normandy Real Estate Partners purchased the building for $880 million in 2018. Columbia entered the picture when it\nacquired Normandy\nin 2019. Two years later, the developers secured a $1.25 billion\nconstruction loan\n, among the largest real estate loans made during the pandemic.\nDespite finding themselves in an unprecedented market due to Covid, the developers plowed ahead with the redevelopment, aiming to bring more than 1 million square feet of office space online in a few years.\nTheir bet could pay off. The tides have begun turning for the Manhattan office market. After\nfinishing last year\non a high note, office leasing volume surpassed 30 million square feet for the year in the third quarter, blowing past pre-Covid levels and marking the strongest period of year-to-date demand since 2002, according to Colliers.\n",

        "content": "A failed flip on the Upper East Side has ensnared a once-busy developer.\nRussian-born developer and art collector Janna Bullock is accused of defaulting on an $8 million loan backed by 14 East 82nd Street, a 9,500-square-foot prewar townhouse she once owned and converted into a single-family home, according to a complaint filed Thursday in Manhattan Supreme Court. The lawsuit also names the property\u2019s owner, Zoya Kuznetsova, as a defendant, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe debt was issued by Antonia Ventures LLC, a shell company linked to Downtown Investment Advisory, a White Plains-based asset manager. The suit claims no payments have been made since February. Bullock personally guaranteed the loan, which means she\u2019s on the hook even though she sold the building more than a decade ago.\nBullock bought the six-story property for $12.2 million in 2006 from Aby Rosen\u2019s RFR Holding, intending to gut-renovate it into a single residence. But construction stalled, leaving the property boarded up with a stop-work order still in place.\nIn 2012, she unloaded the townhouse at a loss for $9.1 million to Kuznetsova, a close associate who, according to society photos and past filings, has family ties to Bullock\u2019s ex-husband, Alexey Kuznetsov, a former Russian government official.\nKuznetsova has since struggled to keep the building out of foreclosure. Last year, the property narrowly avoided auction after she secured emergency financing \u2014 the same loan now in dispute. The lender\u2019s complaint signals that the lifeline may have run out.\n\nBullock, a onetime Guggenheim board member known for flipping Gilded Age townhouses into luxury single-family homes, was among the Upper East Side\u2019s most active redevelopers in the mid-2000s.\nHer projects included 54 East 64th Street, the onetime New York Observer offices, which she bought for $9.5 million in 2004 and resold for $18.7 million two years later, and 9 East 67th Street, which she flipped for roughly $25 million in 2009.\nBullock and Kuznetsov were\nconvicted in absentia\nby a Russian court in 2018 for allegedly embezzling public funds, though both denied the charges.\nKuznetsov was extradited from France to serve his sentence; Bullock remains abroad.\nNeither Bullock nor Kuznetsova could be reached for comment.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Residents of a 180-unit rental building in Sheepshead Bay will soon be saying hello to a new owner: Bonjour Capital.\nThe privately held real estate investment firm acquired the apartment portion of 1501 Voorhies Avenue in the Brooklyn neighborhood for $75 million, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The seller was the prominent multifamily real estate investment trust AvalonBay Communities.\nA Newmark team including Adam Spies, Dan O\u2019Brien and Adam Doneger represented AvalonBay in the deal, which worked out to $417,000 per unit. Both buyer and seller did not respond to the outlet\u2019s request for comment.\nAvalonBay and Muss Development\nfiled plans\nmore than a decade ago for a 30-story building on the site, towering over the rest of the neighborhood and setting the stage for the tallest post-war development in Sheepshead Bay. The partners bought the property in April 2014 for $16.2 million.\nThe development site, an empty lot several blocks from the bay, was completely flooded during Superstorm Sandy.\nIn 2016, the venture filed a \u201ctest the market\u201d application\nfor 56 units\nin the building to be condominiums, rather than rentals. Months later, an official offering plan emerged\nwith a $63 million projected sellout\n. AvalonBay ultimately\nlent $49 million\nfor the project the following year.\n\nCompleted in 2017, the building includes 250,000 square feet of residential space and nearly 34,000 square feet of amenities, including a fitness center, resident lounge, children\u2019s playroom, outdoor pool, barbecues, a bocce court and a pool table.\nThe 12,000-square-foot retail and office portion of the site, listed with an alternative address of 1600 Sheepshead Bay Road, counts Citibank and Starbucks among its tenants.\nOver the summer, Bonjour Capital sold five apartment buildings \u2014 601, 605, 607, 609 and 611 West 137th Street \u2014 to Janusz Sendowski\nfor $62 million\n.\nMeanwhile, Virginia-based AvalonBay recently bought a 270-unit apartment complex in Coconut Creek, Florida\nfor $98.3 million\n.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The properties spent 121 days on the market, on average.\nForty-two luxury listings were added to the market, for a total of 1,152 listings.\nThe\nprevious week\n, buyers signed contracts for 20 properties in Miami-Dade, asking a combined $162.6 million.\nThe asking dollar volume for the nine single-family homes and eight condos under contract last week totals $190.4 million, according to the report, which is authored by the Douglas Elliman team led by Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes.\n\nThe single-family homes that entered into contract last week have an average asking price of $15.8 million and spent an average of 112 days on the market. They total $142.6 million in asking dollar volume.\nThe teardown at 1821 West 27th Street in Miami Beach topped the report. The 6,860-square-foot home, built in 1940, sits on a 0.6-acre lot with 150 feet of water frontage, according to the listing. The\nSunset Islands\nII house is on the market with Compass agent John Sandberg. Property records show Mark and Patricia Jaffe paid just $1.15 million for the seven-bedroom, seven-bathroom house in 1989.\nThe condos that secured buyers last week have an average asking price of $6 million and spent 131 days on the market, on average. They total $47.8 million in asking dollar volume, or an average of $2,333 per square foot.\nA 3,247-square-foot condo at One\nPark Grove\nin Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove went under contract.

Their combined asking price is $286.6 million, and the typical home spent 912 days on the market.\n",

        "content": "The\nrichest real estate developer\nin America didn\u2019t spend a lot of words in cutting off one of his sons amid allegations of a high-flying con job in Beverly Hills.\nDonald Bren\n, chairman and owner of\nIrvine Company\n, issued a 12-word rebuke of son David, who has been embroiled in an alleged fraud scandal, the Daily Mail\nreported\n.\n\u201cWe do not have a personal or business relationship with this individual,\u201d the elder Bren said in a statement.\nDavid Bren allegedly bilked investors out of millions for an apparent private members\u2019 club in Beverly Hills called The Bunker, per the Daily Mail. The 33-year-old son of the 92-year-old real estate titan purportedly used his famous last name to lure investors to the $90 million club that never materialized.\nFour separate lawsuits accuse David Bren of fraud, defaulting on leases, forging luxury lifestyle appearances and trespassing into a Beverly Hills home to live without paying rent. Judgments against the embattled real estate heir total approximately $2.6 million and could continue to grow.\nBren has not appeared in court or retained attorneys in the Bunker cases, and as of now has not faced any criminal charges despite referrals to the Los Angeles Police Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nBren promised buyers of memberships access to a $50 million fleet of supercars including Bugattis, Ferraris and Porsches, as well as amenities including luxury restaurants and exclusive wine and private smoking lounges. Angled as a \u201cSoHo House for car lovers,\u201d Bren dropped names of notable figures such as Mark Cuban and Larry Ellison, claiming them as founding members of the $14,500-per-month club.\nWhile The Bunker, backed by the Bren name, attracted interest, investors began filing lawsuits once they picked up a scent of deception.\n\u201cThe Bunker does not exist. There is no ultra-high end automotive club. There are no members. The business is a mirage,\u201d one lawsuit alleges, according to the Daily Mail.\nBren has deployed his links to his father in pursuing prior real estate deals, sources have said.\n\n\u201cHe presented like he could have picked up the phone and called his father right away,\u201d Chris Rising, whose real estate firm was involved in David\u2019s attempts to buy\nMr. C\u2019s\nCameo Beverly Hills hotel, said, per the Daily Mail.\nThe Brens\u2019 relationship \u2014 at least on the surface \u2014 wasn\u2019t as cordial as it seemed.\n\u201cHe was slick. He played this, like, victim; that\u2019s how he pulled people\u2019s heartstrings. \u2018My dad didn\u2019t give me nothing; I could do this, but no one believes in me,\u2019\u201d Mike Tran, a friend of one allegedly defrauded investor,\ntold\nthe Los Angeles Times.\nIn total, more than a dozen investors claim they sunk hundreds of thousands and even millions of money into The Bunker after falling for David Bren\u2019s purported shtick. They were seemingly swayed by him arriving for property tours in a Lamborghini and hosting luxury events he claimed were sponsored by Louis Vuitton.\nInvestor Tony Chen was among those buying what Bren was selling. He put hundreds of thousands of dollars to the venture, but eventually died by suicide in 2022 at the age of 46, according to reports.\nTran believes it was a result of Bren\u2019s actions.\n\u201cTony built out this thing for this guy like, \u2018Oh man, he\u2019s this underdog. He\u2019s this David. And if he gets this right, he\u2019s going to become Goliath,\u2019\u201d Tran told the Times.\nDonald Bren has been married three times and has seven children, according to reports.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The home at 25421 North\nSaint Mary\u2019s Road\nis on a private listing network for $3.25 million, or $626 per square foot.\nMettawa is known for its horse farms and low\nturnover\n, which keeps inventory tight. Listing agent Donna Mercier of\nColdwell Banker\nRealty told the outlet that homes there typically trade below $6.25 million and attract buyers looking for privacy close to Chicago\u2019s\nNorth Shore\n.\nThe \u201cSpaceship House\u201d was built in 1979 by Peter M. Vanderklaauw, who built several UFO-shaped houses.\nWhen seller Bob Hollar first pulled into the driveway of a white, circular home in Mettawa nearly 30 years ago, his first thought was less admiration than disbelief, he told the outlet.\nThat was 1996, when Hollar, a retired healthcare executive, bought the futuristic residence for $525,000 \u2014 largely for the one feature that did impress him: room for his 145-pound Leonberger dog. Over the years, the property grew on him. The pond, fruit trees and sprawling yard turned the oddball structure into a quiet retreat about 35 miles north of downtown Chicago.\n\nThe house evolved along with the seller\u2019s life. When Hollar\u2019s wife, Lisa Giles, moved in during the early 2000s, the couple embarked on renovations, beginning with the most radical move \u2014 removing an indoor pool that cut through the center of the two-level home. The couple replaced it with livable space, added wood floors, modernized the kitchen and reworked the outdoor areas with patios, landscaping and a small waterfall.\nThe property also features a bridge leading to an island in the pond, where the couple likes to drink wine by the firepit and listen to bullfrogs. Their expansive vegetable garden produces everything from beets to brussels sprouts, and for years, the grounds have been their weekend project and sanctuary.\nWith a new dog that doesn\u2019t travel well and a second home on Kiawah Island in South Carolina, Hollar and Giles said it was time to simplify.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Meyers Accesso plans a 200-unit apartment project in Fort Lauderdale\u2019s Cypress Creek neighborhood.\nMeyers Accesso, a joint venture between Aventura-based Meyers Group and Hallandale Beach-based Accesso, wants to develop the eight-story Avery Cypress Creek at 6210-6282 North Andrews Avenue, according to records and Meyers\u2019 website.\nAn entity tied to Meyers Accesso bought the 2.2-acre development site from Double Mountain Development Ventures, led by co-founders and co-CEOs Fred Burgess and Jack Flechner, according to records. The buyer borrowed\u00a0 $1.6 million for the site from Miami-based Sky 18 Capital.\nDave Preston and Jonathan Carter of Colliers represented the seller.\nAvery Cypress Creek will consist of one- and two-bedroom apartments, Meyers\u2019 website shows.\nThe site is in Uptown Urban Village, an area Fort Lauderdale officials and property owners have long targeted for more mixed-use development. The district is from McNab Road and the C-14 canal south to Northwest 57th Street, and from I-95 west to Powerline Road.\nIn 2019, Fort Lauderdale approved the master plan for the Uptown Urban Village.\nSince then, several developers have seized on the area. Grover Corlew is developing the 312-unit\nMayla Cypress\napartment project at 6261 Northwest Sixth Way. Last year, Fairfield Residential completed the seven-story, 295-unit Treo Apartments at 6500 North Andrews Avenue.\nAlso, Pinnacle wants to develop an affordable housing project with a\n100-unit building and a 96-unit building\nat 6250 North Andrews Avenue, according to Fort Lauderdale city records.\nMeyers Accesso\u2019s other South Florida projects include the 200-unit\nAvery Lake Worth\nwith two buildings completed last year at 3300 Boutwell Road in Lake Worth Beach. Last year, the joint venture paid\n$25 million\nfor the three-story Atrium at Broken Sound office building at 6111 Northwest Broken Sound Parkway in Boca Raton.\n\nThe Meyers Accesso joint venture was formed in 2022, according to Meyers\u2019 website.\nMeyers Group, led by CEO Alan Losada, is a developer and manager of market-rate and affordable apartments, as well as hotels and condominiums, according to its website. The firm was founded about a decade ago by the late Stuart I. Meyers, who died this summer at 83.\nMany of Meyers\u2019 multifamily projects are under its Avery brand. The firm develops much of its affordable housing by using low income housing tax credits, which are disbursed by the state.\nAccesso \u2013\u2013 led by Ariel Bentata, Moises Benzaquen and Claudio Dombey \u2013\u2013 was founded more than 20 years ago and has since owned and managed over $3.3 billion in properties, more than 18 million square feet of offices and more than 1,000 residential units nationwide, according to its website.\nIn January, Accesso paid\n$36.5 million\nfor the six-story Sawgrass Lake Center at 13450 West Sunrise Boulevard in Sunrise. The deal marked a 36.4 percent discount from the property\u2019s 2018 sale price.\nIn Chicago and Houston, Accesso has faced some\nheadwinds and financial woes\nfor its office holdings.\nSouth Florida\u2019s\nmultifamily\nmarket has calmed compared with the leasing and construction bonanza during the pandemic. Over the past year, slower in-migration and an oversupply of apartments have led to a drop in rents, slower leaseups and increased concessions.\nDevelopers starting projects now argue demand and rents will pick up again by the time they complete their buildings next year and in 2027.\nAlso in\nFort Lauderdale\n, Affiliated Development scored an\n$80 million\nconstruction loan in March for the eight-story The Era with 400 apartments at 2125 South Andrews Avenue. And Fuse Group is developing the eight-story Arcadian complex with 480 apartments and 15,000 square feet of retail at 640 Northwest Seventh Avenue.\n",

        "content": "When Brooklyn\u2019s luxury market\nnotched $115 million in contracts\nlast November, housing data guru Jonathan Miller said the contract volume was \u201cthe kind of number you don\u2019t really see.\u201d\nBut last week came close.\nThe borough netted over 35 contracts for over $108 million in contract volume between Sept. 29 and Oct. 5, according to Compass\u2019 weekly report for contracts signed for homes asking at least $2 million. The contracts comprised 12 condos and 23 houses.\nDuring the first week of October last year, the\nborough saw 15 contracts signed for over $56 million\n, and it was the strongest opening to the month since Compass began publishing its reports in 2020.\nThe top contract last week went to a Brooklyn Heights townhouse at 42 Monroe Place asking almost $8.9 million.\nThe 26.5-foot-wide home spans over 6,400 square feet and is laid out as a two-family with duplex residences on the first two and top two floors. Built in 1913, the home has been in the same family for 45 years.\nThe bottom two floors hold a 3,600-square-foot four-bedroom home with a living room, gallery and formal dining room. An extension from the dining room leads into a modern windowed kitchen and separate pantry, along with a home office, casual dining room and adjacent sun room.\nThe third and fourth floors span 2,800 square foot, with a three-bedroom residence. The fourth floor has three bedrooms, including a primary suite.\n\nCorcoran\u2019s Leslie Marshall and Nick Hovsepian had the listing.\nThe second priciest contract last week went to a penthouse at 524 Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint asking almost $6 million. The home, which traded in an off-market deal, set the record for priciest condo sale in Greenpoint,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously\nreported\n.\nPurchased in 2019 for $1.9 million by Ronen Segev, who owns piano reseller Steinway Pianos, the home set the record for the most expensive condo sold in Greenpoint.\nSegev undertook a $2 million renovation of the 1,780-square-foot duplex overlooking McCarren Park, outfitting the home with a custom western cedar round hot tub, outdoor kitchen and a heated cabana with a retractable roof.\nThe home comes with two bedrooms, three bathrooms and 680 additional square feet of outdoor space.\nCompass\u2019 John Chubet, who had the listing, previously listed the apartment for $8 million in 2022 before taking it off the market at the start of 2024. Nest Seekers\u2019 Cornell Jones brought the buyer.\nHomes put into contract last week had a median asking price of $2.75 million and an average price per square foot of $1,206. On average, the homes went for their last asking price.\n",

Racine, Wisconsin-based Johnson Bank, the financial institution owned by the Johnson family, provided a $21 million loan for the off-market purchase, records show.\nJohnson-Marquart is the daughter of the late Samuel Curtis Johnson Jr., the fourth-generation Johnson credited with growing the family business into a multibillion-dollar cleaning supply behemoth. He spearheaded the creation of several first generation aerosol products, including Glade air fresheners, Off! insect repellent and Pledge furnisher polish, according to published reports. His daughter, Johnson-Marquart, is married to music producer Mike Marquart, with whom she shares four children. Forbes estimates her net worth at $4.5 billion.\nThis marks at least her second purchase in\nPalm Beach\n. Her Southern Mark LLC bought the house at 449 Brazilian Avenue for $15.9 million last year, records show.\n\nRobinson is a novelist and the widow of Edward J. Robinson, who was the CFO of RJR Nabisco when it sold to KKR in 1988 for a then-record $25 billion, and inspired the film \u201cBarbarians at the Gate,\u201d according to published reports. He died last year.\nThe Robinsons bought the 7,500-square-foot Clark Avenue home, known as Villa Banyan, for $3.3 million in 1998, records show. It was built in 1929 on 0.4 acres and includes five bedrooms, seven bathrooms and a pool.\nThe couple listed it for $14.9 million in 2019, before taking it off the market in 2020, Zillow shows. Deborah Robinson is downsizing to a condo on the south end of Palm Beach. Records show she bought unit 503 at the Bellaria at 3000 South Ocean Boulevard for $9.4 million.\nThe sale marks the latest pricey deal in Palm Beach, where sales are picking up after the slow summer season. Last month, Jon Steinberg, a media executive known for founding Cheddar News, bought a spec home for\n$14.6 million\nin an off-market deal. Also last month, Lucerne Capital Management founder Pieter Taselaar sold his mansion for\n$29.5 million\nin an off-market deal. Ex-Apple CEO John Sculley also sold his oceanfront estate for\n$37 million\n.",

        "content": "The fast-growing business of\nJack Harris and Michael Fahimian\nis now clocking over $76 million in Beverly Hills Flats deals this year with the duo\u2019s latest closing.\nThe Beverly Hills Estates agents confirmed the closing of 722 North Maple Drive this past week for $22.4 million, or about $2,571 per square foot. The duo represented a local family in its purchase of the home, while Keller Williams\u2019\nGary Gold\nwas the listing agent.\nThe off-market deal means Harris and Fahimian are now behind three of the five transactions in the tony Beverly Hills neighborhood that have closed above $20 million this year.\n\u201cWe have the market cornered,\u201d Fahimian boasted.\nThe\nHarris and Fahimian\nteam made their debut at\nNo. 20\non\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s recently released list of Los Angeles County\u2019s top 25 agents and teams, with 18 transactions totaling $200.8 million. The list reflects deals over $1 million recorded in the Multiple Listing Service between July 1, 2024 and July 1, 2025.\n\u201cWe\u2019re noticing a lot of deals being done off market in the Flats,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe\u2019re also noticing a lot of deals selling fairly close to ask, within 10 percent of the asking price.\u201d\n\nThe two said several factors are at play to benefit the Flats, which gets its name from the largely level terrain and large lots comprising the neighborhood between Sunset and Santa Monica boulevards. Among them are neighborhood\u2019s amenities, including the school district, police and fire services, the two said. More recent events have further fueled the area\u2019s popularity.\nMeasure United to House L.A., the two-tiered tax that applies to all property sales within the city of Los Angeles, makes Beverly Hills a good alternative for anyone looking to avoid paying the assessment. There\u2019s also the more recent concern around obtaining insurance, especially post-January\u2019s wildfires.\n\u201cAnother thing that\u2019s huge is the ability to get good insurance in the Flats because it\u2019s out of a fire zone,\u201d Fahimian said. \u201cA lot of the large carriers are still writing insurance policies in the Flats, whereas they are completely out of certain fire zones in Los Angeles and don\u2019t even offer insurance.\u201d\nSo far in 2025, home sales in the Flats have crept up to as high as $27 million. That\u2019s the highest price so far this year for the neighborhood, with two properties tied for the designation.\nCarolwood Estates co-founder and CEO Drew Fenton was the listing agent on the first $27 million deal, which closed in February, at 620 North Beverly Drive. Fahimian and Harris represented the buyer in that transaction, which penciled out to about $2,558 per square foot.\nIn June, Harris and Compass\u2019 Jessica Pasternak represented the seller, while Harris and Fahimian negotiated on behalf of the buyer for 521 North Canon Drive. The deal was recorded as closing for $27 million, or $1,641 per square foot. However, the buyer paid an additional $1 million for the property\u2019s furniture, according to the duo.\n",

A sale at that price would be $411,000 per unit. The property at 6-8 Locksley Avenue is under contract though a deal has yet to close.\nThe potential deal is a sign that multifamily investors are ready to bet on San Francisco again amid an increase in rents and artificial intelligence jobs in the city.\nA 332-square-foot studio apartment at Sunset Towers is advertised at $3,320, which is $10 per square foot. A one-bedroom is listed for $6.60 per square foot. The average rent price in San Francisco is just under $4.50 per square foot, according to Apartments.com.\nRents for Class A apartments in San Francisco are up 8.8 percent year-over-year, according to CBRE. Class B and C properties, meanwhile, have seen a growth of about 5.5 percent. Demand is reportedly being driven by tech workers, especially those in AI and related fields.\nThe data appears to support the idea of an AI-linked bounceback. For nearly two years, between mid-2022 and 2024, San Francisco had no sales of 100-plus-unit apartment developments, as investors weren\u2019t convinced the city was humming back to life.\n\nAvalonBay has believed for months that the\nAI boom is behind rising apartment rents\nacross the city. Housing demand has increased amid\nreturn-to-office mandates\n, improved public safety and AI-dominated job growth, according to AvalonBay COO Sean Breslin.\n\u201cAI is certainly a big part of that,\u201d Breslin told investors in May of the upward pricing trend, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nAvalonBay president and CEO Benjamin Schall told investors last month that sales across its portfolio could increase as rents and property values pick up.\nInvestors will likely be drawn to existing multifamily properties instead of sinking money into new construction. More than\n20,000 apartment units\nin San Francisco are in limbo as projects face years of delays or dissolve entirely. Last year, just 1,453 housing units were completed and plans were filed for 2,541 new homes, down from more than 5,000 delivered in 2020.\nAvalonBay\nowns nearly 3,400 apartments in San Francisco with a value of about $1.2 billion.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A slice of Panther Island could soon go vertical.\nThe City of Fort Worth will consider rezoning 15.4 acres near downtown to allow buildings as tall as 15 stories, paving the way for denser development on the long-stalled waterfront district. The proposed zoning covers land between North Commerce Street and the future Ring Road, and between Northeast Fourth and Fifth streets, near the Coyote Drive-In site at 223 NE Fourth Street, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The Fort Worth Zoning Commission is set to consider the case this week, with a City Council vote expected Oct. 21.\nThe change would bring density to an area largely limited to five-story projects, permitting taller towers and smaller structures within mixed-use developments, in alignment with the city\u2019s form-based code and canal-focused master plan.\nThe city has been pushing for years to activate the mostly underdeveloped 500-acre Panther Island, which spans public and private parcels just north of downtown. The\nproject\n\u2014 envisioned as a sprawling\ndistrict\nwith investments exceeding $1.1 billion \u2014 will also require new canal systems in order to mitigate flooding.\nThe canal network is central to the district\u2019s long-promised transformation, connecting two forks of the Trinity River north of NW 8th Street, according to a 234-page report issued last year by Consultant HR&amp;A Advisors and San Antonio-based Lake Flato architects. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers secured\n$403 million\nto aid flood control in 2023, opening up Panther Island to development.\nThe\nreport\nidentified areas of the north island\u2019s interior that could be developed before flood control improvements are in place.The consultant divided Panther Island into zones to prioritize development.\n\nThe first phase could focus on 12 acres along North Main Street, designated as a high-impact area for early development, and recent zoning changes have included increasing height limits to 20 stories and removing restrictions on building floor plate sizes.\nThe city aims to attract higher-density, transit-oriented growth to Panther Island. The study called access and connectivity to the island \u201cnotably inadequate,\u201d citing fragmented pedestrian infrastructure, including a lack of access to the Trinity Trail system.\nSusan Alanis, Panther Island program director for the Tarrant Regional Water District, told council members last month that the rezoning sets the stage for the first phase of canal construction, slated to start next year.\nA request for quotes from developers to design and build the canal system is expected to open this fall. The project is seen as a critical catalyst for private investment, which has been slow to materialize since the Encore apartments \u2014 a 300-unit complex with its own man-made waterway \u2014 were delivered in 2018.\nCity leaders have been methodically revising zoning across Panther Island to encourage higher-density construction. Last year, the council approved a change along North Main Street that lifted height caps to 20 stories and removed floor-plate limits for taller towers.\nIf approved, the latest rezoning could position the northeast section of the island for early redevelopment as\nFort Worth\nfinally moves from planning to pouring concrete.\n",

        "content": "The day after Mayor Eric Adams dropped his re-election bid, real estate donors turned to Andrew Cuomo.\nThe latest filings with the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board show that industry professionals gave more than $32,000 to Cuomo on Sept. 29, one day after Adams announced that he was suspending his campaign. When including donations given to Cuomo\u2019s campaign the day of\nthe mayor\u2019s announcement\n, that number climbs to roughly $41,000.\nThat\u2019s more than half of the $77,700 he took in from industry donors between Aug. 19 and Sept. 29, according to a\nTRD\nanalysis of campaign finance filings that included different real estate sectors, including development, property ownership/management, commercial, residential, architecture and construction. These totals include donors who self-reported working in the real estate industry or could otherwise be easily identified in filings.\nThe industry donations were part of a rush of contributions after Adams\nabandoned his campaign\n. During this reporting period, Cuomo received $895,000 in donations (when accounting for contributions that were refunded), with $380,000 coming in on Sept. 28 and 29.\nReal estate donors who gave the maximum of $2,100 in the six-week filing period include: A&amp;H Acquisitions\u2019\nAlex Adjmi\n, investor Yaacov Amar, Crown Acquisitions\u2019 Richard Chera, Coldwell Banker broker Emily Becker and United American Land principals (and brothers) Jody, Jason and Albert Laboz.\nRepublican donor and Florida developer Alan Keen, who was also\ninvolved\nin the Florida chapter of No Labels, a centrist group that pursued but eventually\nabandoned\nplans to nominate a third-party presidential candidate, also gave $2,100, as did Michigan-based shopping mall developer Robert Taubman.\n\nA few members of the Cayre\nfamily\ndonated on Sept. 29, including Cayre Equities\u2019 Ken Cayre, who gave $400 and Aurora Capital Associates\u2019 Robert Cayre, who donated $250. Aurora President Jared Epstein was one of several people who sent out an email\ncalling for donations\nto Cuomo after Adams dropped out of the race. The email stressed the need to \u201cdefend NYC against radical socialist policies,\u201d referring to frontrunner Zohran Mamdani, who is a Democratic Socialist.\nMeanwhile, Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa brought in $423,700, of which at least $11,750 came from industry donors. Landlord Jerry Lebedowicz was the only real estate donor to give the full $2,100. M&amp;N Management\u2019s Nikitas Drakotos and Bronx landlord Alan Feurman each contributed $500.\nMamdani received more than $410,000 during the six-week filing period, with at least $2,500 coming from donors working in real estate. The most he received from industry donors during this period was a $500 contribution from an affordable housing developer based in Sacramento, Calif. Still, some industry leaders have\nsignaled\nthat they plan to work with Mamdani if he wins in November.\nBefore the Democratic primary last summer, Cuomo was the clear favorite among the real estate industry. A\nTRD\nanalysis\nin June found that people in the industry donated more $500,000 directly to this campaign. Following Mamdani\u2019s win, the industry\nremained split\non\nwho to back\n.\nEven with Adams out of the race, Cuomo faces an uphill battle.\nA September poll\nby the New York Times and Siena University found that in order for Cuomo to meaningfully chip away at Mamdani\u2019s double-digit lead, Sliwa would need to drop out of the race.\nAfter Cuomo lost the June primary, Adams saw a spike in donations from the real estate industry. Following the\nindictments\nof some of his top-ranking officials, he dragged even further in the polls, trailing fourth behind Sliwa. As a result,\ncontributions slowed\n. The latest filings show some industry donations trickled to his campaign, but most of the disclosure features refunds to previous real estate professionals.\n",

        "content": "A hefty deal is in the works at a condo tower next to the Museum of Modern Art that\u2019s been plagued by discounts, slow sales and developer disagreements.\nUnit 65 at 53 West 53rd Street, asking just under $47 million, was the priciest Manhattan home to land a signed contract last week, according to Olshan Realty\u2019s weekly report. The full-floor apartment was one of 29 properties to find buyers between Sept. 29 and Oct. 5, up from 23 in the\nprevious period\n.\nThe building\u2019s developers \u2014 a group including Hines and Singapore\u2019s Pontiac Land Group \u2014 initially sought $51 million for the 6,400-square-foot pad in 2015, when they began marketing units off of floor plans. They dropped the asking price to just under $44 million when the apartment was listed on Streeteasy in 2017, before raising its price tag again four years later.\nThe home has four bedrooms and four bathrooms. It also features a corner great room and views of Central Park. Amenities in the 161-unit tower include a concierge, fitness center, lap pool and golf simulator.\nThe developers\ntapped Douglas Elliman\nto replace Corcoran Sunshine at the helm of sales at the project in 2021, following years of sluggish momentum and a series of controversial price cuts that pushed the developers into arbitration with each other. At the time, the building\u2019s projected sellout was lowered from more than $2 billion to $1.96 billion.\nElliman\u2019s Renee Micheli is the sales director at 53 West 53rd Street, with Elliman\u2019s Shari Scharfer Rollins, Jade Chan, Frances Katzen and Michelle Griffith all listed as representing the listing on Streeteasy.\n\nThe second most expensive home to snag an inked deal was a penthouse at Related Companies\u2019 520 West 28th Street, asking $35 million. The triplex last traded five years ago for $20 million, down from its initial asking price of\n$50 million\nin 2015.\nUnit PH37, which was redesigned by the seller, has five bedrooms, five bathrooms and 2,600 square feet of outdoor space spread between a balcony and roof terrace. The condo also features a great room overlooking the High Line, a hot tub and cold plunge pool.\nAmenities at the Zaha Hadid-designed building include a pool, garage, spa and fitness center.\nCompass\u2019 Hudson Advisory Team, including co-founders Clayton Orrigo and Stephen Ferrara and agent Arran Patel, had the listing.\nOf the 29 properties, 21 were condos, five were co-ops and three were townhouses.\nThis week\u2019s homes\u2019 combined asking price was $287 million, for an average price of $9.9 million and a median of $6 million. The typical home spent about two and a half years on the market and was discounted 9 percent from the original listing price.\n",

She pulled the home from the market in July, shortly after listing the Palm Beach townhouse for $17 million.\nThe Brazilian Avenue townhouse was built in 2022 on 0.2 acres.

The vote affirms a previous decision by the Los Angeles City Planning Commission to allow the development to proceed.\nUnder Vermont Real Estate\u2019s plan, the car wash, located near Barnsdall Art Park at the busy intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and North Vermont Avenue, would be replaced by a seven-story building with 139 studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments. The ground floor would feature a grocery store and residents would have access to parking for 145 vehicles.\nBecause of its proximity to the Vermont/Sunset Metro station, the approved plans for the project include Transit Oriented Communities\naffordable housing\nincentives, clearing the way to build a larger building than zoning rules would normally allow. The developer would have to set aside 16 of the new apartments for affordable housing for extremely-low-income Angelenos. For one person to\nqualify\n, they would have to make $31,850 or less annually; a household of four would be limited to an income of $45,450.\nDesigns are being handled by Daryoush Safai, per Urbanize. The contemporary podium building would come with an outward-facing courtyard against Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nThe Supporters Alliance for Environmental Responsibility (SAFER), an affiliate of Laborers International Union of North America Local 270 (LIUNA),\nfiled an appeal\nagainst the project that led to its latest bureaucratic snag. That appeal came after a previous one before the Planning Commission in October 2024 was rejected. In its most recent attempt, SAFER urged the Planning Commission to pause the proposed development to allow for further environmental study.\nVermont Real Estate\u2019s development would join two other mixed-use complexes near Barnsdall Art Park.\nLaTerra Development\nrecently completed two buildings next to the park at 4850 and 4900 Hollywood Boulevard, while Lazer Properties is building an 86-unit complex with ground-floor retail across the street from the park at 4773 Hollywood Boulevard, according to Urbanize.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The 188 planned residences start in the $400,000s, with completion expected in 2027 or 2028, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. Indianapolis-based Flaherty &amp; Collins is building The Franklin, a $100 million mixed-use tower near the new train station that\u2019s set to open in 2026.\nThe momentum follows last year\u2019s completion of a second Metra South Shore Line track and new station, which cut the train ride to Chicago to about an hour. The improved commute has made\nMichigan City\nviable for professionals\npriced out\nof the city but unwilling to give up its amenities \u2014 a zoo, a lighthouse, outlet shopping and a casino \u2014 or its proximity to the Indiana\nDunes\nNational Park, which draws about 3 million visitors annually.\nDevelopers\nare taking note. Deron Kintner of Flaherty &amp; Collins told the outlet that Michigan City has character.\n\n\u201cWith the speed to get to Chicago and back, we think it\u2019s going to be very desirable to live in,\u201d Kintner said.\nFarpoint Development\u2019s Scott Goodman said the town\u2019s mix of affordability and access makes it \u201calmost a suburb.\u201d\nMichigan City\u2019s renaissance does have hurdles. The coal plant and cooling tower looming over its lakefront is derided locally as \u201cthe monstrosity.\u201d Operator NIPSCO plans to close the facility by 2028 but may instead convert it to gas power.\nThe state prison nearby, also slated for closure, could eventually open prime redevelopment land. Mayor Angie Nelson Deuitch said the goal is to attract newcomers without pushing out residents.\n\u201cWe want industry, but tourism is a big part of who we are now,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "With the number of casino contenders slashed in half, the real competition for a license in New York may boil down to two teams.\nMany consider existing slot parlors \u2014 MGM Empire City in Yonkers and Queens Aqueduct Casino, operated by Resorts World \u2014 to be shoo-ins for two of the three state casino licenses up for grabs.\nThat leaves New York Mets owner Steve Cohen\u2019s Metropolitan Park and Bally\u2019s Bronx.\nFor simplicity\u2019s sake,\nThe Real Deal\ndecided to compare these two proposals, which many are already pitting head-to-head. That being said, the playing field is still open, the two racinos may not clinch the deals \u2014 and it\u2019s also possible the Gaming Commission won\u2019t award all three licenses.\n\u201cThis is a tabula rasa,\u201d Brian O\u2019Dwyer, chair of the commission, said during a Sept. 30 meeting. \u201cThere are no front-runners or favorites.\u201d\nCohen, who is teaming up with Hard Rock International, wants to turn 50 acres of parking lots near Citi Field into a casino complex that includes a 1,000-key hotel, a 5,650-person live music venue and 25 acres of green space. The team has billed the project as a way to turn the Flushing, Queens, ballpark into a year-round destination and to keep Mets fans onsite after games.\nThe Bally\u2019s casino would be built on 16 acres of parking lots and practice-green area at Bally\u2019s Golf Links at Ferry Point. The project would include 500 hotel rooms and a 2,000-seat entertainment venue.\nThe golf course is city-owned land, which is managed by Bally\u2019s. The company acquired the golf course\u2019s lease from the Trump Organization in 2023. If it secures a casino license, as part of that 2023 deal, it must pay Trump $115 million,\naccording to the New York Times\n.\nThe state\u2019s Gaming Facility Location Board is expected to decide who receives a casino license by Dec. 1. The state Gaming Commission will then issue the licenses before the end of the year.\nUnlike\nthe Community Advisory Committees that eliminated four of the eight casino proposals last month \u2014 which were supposed to determine the projects\u2019 fates based on the input of the nearby neighborhoods, but members often appeared beholden to the politicians who appointed them \u2014 the board has specific criteria for evaluating the projects. The body will consider four different categories, with \u201ceconomic activity and business development\u201d carrying the most weight (making up 70 percent of each proposal\u2019s score).\n\nThat category includes a project\u2019s estimated revenue and taxes, as well as the number of jobs it will create and how much these employees will be paid. Other factors in this category include how quickly the casino can be built and proof that it can be fully financed.\nMetropolitan Park is larger than Bally\u2019s and is expected to bring in more revenue and annual taxes. The team has said that the site is shovel-ready, and construction will begin in January if it obtains the license in December. The project is expected to be complete by June 2030, according to the team\u2019s application.\nConstruction on Bally\u2019s would begin eight to nine months after receiving a license.\nThe other categories, worth 10 percent each, include local impact siting, workforce enhancement and diversity framework. The first pertains to ways the project teams are working to minimize the impact of their projects on surrounding communities and how they will work with and promote local businesses. The last two focus on various aspects of employee hiring, training, retention and diversity.\nThis information is laid out in the teams\u2019 applications, to varying degrees. Some details, including financing, are not readily available, given that the applications are heavily redacted. Metropolitan Park\u2019s application states, however, that the development team will use a combination of debt and equity to finance construction of the project, noting that if it faces any unexpected challenge in lining up debt, \u201cthe partners are financially stable enough to raise the additional capital.\u201d\nHere\u2019s how Bally\u2019s and Metropolitan Park\u00a0stack up. The breakdowns are not exhaustive and only include factors that can be easily compared, i.e. numbers.\n",

The mansion and guest house were completed last year. The couple is likely related to the Donatucci Kitchens &amp; Appliances family based in Pennsylvania.\nThe property was asking $31.2 million with Leslie Leopold and Cheri Tindall of Ocean Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. Serhant\u2019s\nAngel Nicolas\nrepresented the buyer.\nLeopold and Nicolas declined to comment on the buyer\u2019s identity in the purchase, which was first reported by the\nWall Street Journal\n.\n\nThe property features 150 feet of private water frontage, including a dock, boat ramp, beach and two pools, according to the listing. It includes a 7,600-square-foot main house and a 2,700-square-foot guest house.\nThe previous record home sale in the Florida Keys was the $23 million trade of an Islamorada mansion called Palm Harbor.\nPortnoy also owns a home in Miami. He paid\nnearly $14 million\nfor a nine-bedroom, eight-and-a-half-bathroom house in Miami\u2019s Morningside in 2021, then a record for the neighborhood. Before he acquired his Miami home, Portnoy was\nreportedly\nrenting Floyd Mayweather Jr.\u2019s former Miami Beach house for $200,000 a month.\nPortnoy founded Barstool Sports, then a sports and gambling blog company, in 2003. In 2022, majority stakeholder Chernin Group announced it was selling 50 percent of Barstool to Penn National Gaming, in a deal that valued the company\nat $450 million\n. But Portnoy bought the digital media company back from Penn Entertainment for $1 in 2023, as part of a larger deal that included a brand licensing agreement with ESPN. Barstool is based in Chicago.\n",

        "content": "The former headquarters of Zendesk is now under lender control.\nLenders have seized ownership of the 77,225-square-foot 1019 Market Street building at a foreclosure auction, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The unnamed entities placed the winning bid at $10.3 million after the borrower stopped making payments on a $33.5 million loan backed by the property.\nPrior to the lenders\u2019 purchase, the previous owner was 1019 Market Street LP, reported to be an affiliate of an investment fund managed by Deutsche Bank,\naccording\nto the Business Times. The ownership bought the property for $48.3 million, or $625 per square foot. A Morningstar appraisal in August placed the building\u2019s value at $14.7 million \u2014 a notable fall from its appraisal price of $71.4 million in 2019, according to Cred IQ\ndata\ncited by the Business Times.\nThe trustee,\nChicago Title Company\n, filed a notice of mortgage default in April on behalf of the lenders. The following month, lenders alleged in a lawsuit that the building owner stopped making its monthly payment on the $33.5 million loan linked to the building in February. The owner was identified as Deutsche asset management arm DWS. A month later, Chris Neilson of Trigild was appointed the building\u2019s receiver.\n\nZendesk\nsigned its lease for the 1019 Market building in 2013, a year before 1019 Market Street LP affiliate bought the building. In 2021, Zendesk paid $7 million to terminate its lease. The company exited the building in 2022 and\nplanted its flag at 181 Fremont Street\n; the 1019 Market building has been vacant ever since, aside from a retail tenant in a small ground-floor commercial space.\nHow the lenders proceed with the Mid-Market building after the\npurchase at foreclosure auction\nremains to be seen. They could move to sell the building to a new buyer at a lower price than was available to previous ownership. In doing that, a future owner would have more flexibility as to how to deal with and invest in the building.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The seller of the lower unit was\nWillow Oak Holdings LLC\n,\nwhich paid $11.8 million for their unit in 2018.\nCorcoran\u2019s\nDeborah Kern\nhad both listings.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe priciest commercial deal recorded in New York City was near Grand Central Station, where a 27-story office property at\n5 East 42nd Street\nsold for $135 million. The buyer was the\nVanbarton Group\n, and the seller was the\nMilstein family\u2019s\nNew York Private Bank &amp; Trust\n, which had owned the building for decades.\nVanbarton plans to convert the 375,000-square-foot property into a 500-unit apartment complex, according to\nCrain\u2019s\n.\n\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nBonjour Capital\nscooped up floors three through 19 at\n1501 Voorhies Avenue\nin Sheepshead Bay for $74.2 million from\nAvalonBay Communities.\nThe portion that was sold covers about 172,000 square feet.

        "content": "The latest donation numbers are in for NYC\u2019s mayoral race.\nUnsurprisingly, some real estate folks threw money Andrew Cuomo\u2019s way after Mayor Eric Adams dropped out of the race.\nMore than half\nof the funds he received from industry folks were donated the day of and after Adams announced he would not seek reelection.\nHere are the totals (including campaign refunds this reporting period) from Aug. 19 to Sept. 29:\nAndrew Cuomo: $895,000\nFrom real estate: $77,700\nZohran Mamdani: $410,000\nFrom real estate: $2,500\nCurtis Sliwa: $423,700\nFrom real estate: $11,750\nMeanwhile, various political action committees continue to draw tens of thousands, in some cases hundreds of thousands, of dollars. A quick overview of the latest donations shows more of the same spending patterns among industry professionals and some surprises.\nNotably, Toll Brothers President David Von Spreckelsen gave $2,500 to OneNYC, a PAC backing Mamdani, just a few days before Adams abandoned his campaign. Within the industry, affordable housing developers appeared to be the first to publicly warm up to the idea of a Mamdani administration. Real estate trade group leaders have also said they\nexpect to work closely\nwith Mamdani if he becomes mayor.\nThe Solomon Organization, a New Jersey-based development firm, gave $35,000 to New Yorkers for a Better Future Mayor 25, an anti-Mamdani PAC, in September. Abro Management\u2019s Richard Scharf contributed $25,000 to the PAC in August, but the amount wasn\u2019t reported until last month. An LLC tied to Berndt Perl, co-founder of APF Properties, gave the PAC $2,500 in August, which was reported this month.\nElizabeth Tisch, married to Jon Tisch, CEO of Loews Hotels, gave pro-Cuomo PAC Fix the City $50,000 last month. In the lead-up to the primary, Fix the City raked in millions from real estate donors.\nKamson Corporation CEO Richard Kurtz donated another $50,000 this month to Anyone but Mamdani, a PAC formed by private investigator and\nformer\nAdams ally Bo Dietl. Kurtz gave the PAC $50,000 in August as well.\nJust days before Adams\u2019 exit, cryptocurrency billionaire Brock Pierce gave $1.1 million to Empower NYC, a super PAC backing Adams. Pierce apparently is urging Adams to change his mind,\nper the New York Daily News\n.\n\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nIf you could ask each of the mayoral candidates one real estate-related question, what would it be? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nThe\nNYC chapter of the League of Women Voters is endorsing most of the housing-related measures that will appear on the ballot Nov. 4.

        "content": "Democrat Ben Chou is trying to unseat Republican City Council member Vickie Paladino in northeast Queens. Why should the industry care? Because competitive races reveal which way the pendulum is swinging on key real estate issues.\nOne thing is clear: Candidates do not see the housing shortage as a safe topic in single-family neighborhoods.\nPaladino, a Trump-style conservative, opposes any development that would change the character of her district. That fuzzy argument has been used by Republicans and Democrats alike against all manner of rezonings and projects \u2014 even accessory dwelling units.\nThe City of Yes for Housing Opportunity was a good example. It was explicitly designed to add a little housing in every community, but not the same amount in every community, to avoid changing their character.\nIt was proportional, meaning dense areas like Midtown South would get more units than low-scale neighborhoods such as College Point, Whitestone, Bayside, Douglaston and Little Neck, all of which Paladino represents. Yet Paladino railed against City of Yes.\nQueens politicians who are primarily polemicists (\nPaladino\n) or entertainers (Curtis Sliwa) portrayed City of Yes as The End of Queens as We Know It. I try to ignore Paladino\u2019s\npropaganda\nand Sliwa\u2019s\nshtick\n. The more oxygen they consume, the less there is for serious debate.\nFortunately, Paladino and her conservative colleagues were unable to sabotage City of Yes, which passed the Council 31 to 20 \u2014 not on partisan lines, but geographic ones. This\nCity Limits map\nshows a crescent-shaped swath of \u201cno\u201d votes across the farthest-from-Manhattan neighborhoods where, not coincidentally, the least housing has been built.\nChou cannot possibly be worse than Paladino on housing development. But will he be better? His website doesn\u2019t even mention the issue, although land use is the Council\u2019s most important power and the city has a severe housing shortage.\n\nThat\u2019s because a pro-development platform might well be suicidal for a Council District 19 candidate.\nWhat does play well there? Protecting large residential buildings from the city\u2019s\ncarbon emissions cap\n.\nChou\u2019s website says he will \u201csave co-ops from the burden of Local Law 97.\u201d His explanation: \u201cWe cannot fight climate change by putting the cost on the backs of working- and middle-class homeowners. Local Law 97 is an important and well-meaning law, but it places an unfair burden on co-ops and condos.\u201d\nChou proposes extending and expanding the J-51 tax break to help co-ops and condos reduce their emissions.\nPaladino \u2014 unlike Chou \u2014 opposes Local Law 97. But, realizing she cannot repeal it, she also wants a salve like J-51. She also introduced a bill in 2023 to\npush back Local Law 97\u2019s deadlines\nby seven years. (It didn\u2019t pass.)\n\u201cMy bill seeks to\nbuy time\n,\u201d she said then. \u201cYes, I\u2019m opposed to the law, but if it has to happen, we have to do it wisely. If we\u2019re going to push these drastic climate bills, it would be nice if there was a J-51 type of tax break.\u201d\nIt makes sense, politically, to offer help to co-ops and condos large enough to be subject to Local Law 97. Queens politicians love their co-ops and condos. Just don\u2019t ask them to allow any more to be built.\n",

        "content": "Tom Comforte is looking to cash out while the cranes are still swinging in Fulton Market.\nThe West Loop landowner put his site at 1240 West Carroll Avenue on the market, seeking to ride the apartment wave reshaping the corridor\u2019s western edge, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nComforte tapped CBRE brokers Tom Svoboda and Dominic Soltero to find a buyer for the parcel, which sits between two development sites owned by Sterling Bay, according to marketing materials. The property could yield up to 123 residential units on its own, or as many as 239 if a buyer also secures two small adjacent lots from Sterling Bay.\nThe listing comes as apartment developers swarm the former meatpacking district, betting on surging rents and long-term demand despite a tough financing climate.\nComforte, whose family once ran HVAC firm Climatemp out of Fulton Market before decamping to Broadview, has gradually offloaded holdings as the neighborhood evolved from industrial to mixed use hotspot.\nTwo major projects are already advancing nearby.\nSterling Bay\nis under contract to sell most of the 1200 West block of Carroll to developer Tom Roszak, who plans a\n29-story tower\nwith 398 apartments. One block west, Sterling Bay is shopping its site at\n1300 West Carroll\n, where the city signed off last year on a 700-unit proposal.\n\nRoszak told the outlet that Comforte\u2019s land was in play while he pursued his own deal but said the new listing won\u2019t alter his project, which still needs city council approval.\nEven with construction loans scarce and interest rates high, Fulton Market\u2019s housing pipeline keeps expanding. Chicago-based LG Group recently filed plans for a five-story, 66-unit building a few blocks south at\nKinzie and Racine\n, underscoring the neighborhood\u2019s resilience.\nComforte hasn\u2019t set an asking price for his Carroll Avenue property, and neither he nor Sterling Bay returned requests for comment. But with residential developers circling and the city\u2019s westward growth showing few signs of slowing, Comforte may find now is the right moment to sell.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n\n\n",

Coincidentally, the outpost will be in the former Jeffrey\u2019s Toys store, the inspiration behind the \u201cToy Story\u201d films, which closed in January 2024 amid decreasing foot traffic\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a vibe shift happening in the area,\u201d O\u2019Connor told the Standard. \u201cThings are looking up, and we wanted to be part of that story.\u201d\nOther tenants have been moving in in recent months. A watch shop called Clicky Bezel and wedding boutique Chien &amp; Buffle have opened their doors. In August, a John Varvatos store debuted on the strip, joining other menswear shops like Suit Supply, which recently renewed its lease, and Hugo Boss, which is reportedly in the market for a Union Square space, including a potential Maiden Lane shop.\n\nRetailers aren\u2019t the only ones planting flags on Maiden Lane. Just as the\nartificial intelligence boom\nis\ngobbling up office space\nin the city, commercial spaces above the pedestrian street are attracting AI startups.\nEnterprise AI platform Writer, for example, moved this year into an upper-floor space.\nKaizen, another AI company, recently signed a lease for\nMaiden Lane offices\n. The price point for office space could be a draw for many firms. Class A offices in the Financial District lease for upwards of $65 per square foot, while offices in Union Square and Maiden Lane lease for $38 to $49 per square foot.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The purchase of Seattle-based Redfin closed in July, solidifying Rocket\u2019s plan to vertically integrate the process of buying, selling and financing homes.\n\u201cBy combining mortgage servicing and loan origination, along with home search through Redfin, we are paving the path for Americans to own the dream,\u201d CEO Varun Krishna said.\nThe merger with\nMr. Cooper\nunites two of the country\u2019s biggest mortgage players. Rocket is one of the largest originators in the U.S., while Mr. Cooper ranks as the nation\u2019s top mortgage servicer.

The company cut about 2 percent of its\nworkforce\nin July, soon after closing the\nRedfin deal\n, citing redundant roles across overlapping divisions.\nRocket\u2019s move to dominate every stage of the housing market mirrors strategies by tech and financial giants chasing end-to-end control of consumer transactions.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Another five\nHouston-area\nPicklr clubs are expected by the end of 2027, though sites haven\u2019t been disclosed.\n\nThe company\u2019s investors include Chaifetz Group, Navigator Partners and Pickleball Inc., the parent company of the PPA Tour.\nIts rapid rollout is national: The Picklr opened its 50th club this month in Littleton, Colorado, and says another 70 are in the pipeline. More than 500 franchise agreements have been sold across the U.S., including 16 locations across the Texas Triangle.\nWhile most clubs are franchised, the company keeps some corporate-run sites to test products and programs. The three Houston locations each have different local franchisees.\nInternationally, The Picklr is extending its reach to Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand through master franchise deals. It\u2019s also partnering with JLL to scout markets in Europe.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "There\u2019s blood in the water, and it\u2019s coming from Jon Venetos.\nThe founder of Dallas-based Lurin Capital has been bleeding assets since April, when lender Acore Capital Management\nforeclosed on a dozen Lurin-owned assets\nin Florida.\nAcore filed six lawsuits last week asking for judgments totalling $80.7 million, Venetos\u2019 payment guaranties, plus other default-related expenses, court records show.\nThe lender claims Venetos personally guaranteed the $394.4 million he borrowed; Acore alleges his liability was triggered when he defaulted on the loans and when he allowed mechanics\u2019 liens to be placed on the properties. Lurin Capital didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nThe guaranties were on loans tied to three Texas properties and 12 Florida properties. The Florida portfolio started being sold at foreclosure auctions in April. The loans tied to the properties totalled $383.6 million.\nVenetos is also fighting a\nrecent lawsuit from Select Securities Europe\n, a lender from Luxembourg that claims he defaulted on 15 loans totaling $40.5 million.\n\nVenetos launched Lurin Capital with his wife Ashley after he was axed by hedge fund Citadel. He told a podcast in 2022 that Lurin builds on his family\u2019s 60 years of experience in multifamily real estate.\nHe explained the pivot from finance: \u201cThe opportunity to extract outsize returns with a relatively manageable amount of risk was far greater in real estate.\u201d\nThe Venetoses launched Lurin in 2016 among a wave of upstart real estate operators who planned to make money by purchasing Class B apartment complexes, updating them, raising rents and selling them at a profit.\nLurin\u2019s website says the firm owns 46 properties across five states, but the list includes assets that have faced foreclosure.\nInterest rates threw sand in the gears for many of them, increasing debt service on their floating-rate loans and raising construction costs. At the same time, Texas, a hotspot for value-add multifamily operators, was absorbing a historic wave of apartment development, causing rental rates and occupancy levels to fall.\nAs a result, experts anticipate\na wave of multifamily distress in Texas\n, where about $19 billion in CMBS loans tied to multifamily is set to mature in the next five years.\n",

That brings the state\u2019s footprint at the tower to more than 117,000 square feet.\nThe asking rent on the expansion, which covers the building\u2019s top two floors, was $85 per square foot. A CBRE team including Stephen Siegel, Liz Lash and Peter Larkin represented the tenant, while another team from the brokerage including Robert Alexander, Ryan Alexander and Emily Chabrier represented the landlord.\nWith the expansion, the 1.5 million-square-foot, 47-story office property is fully occupied.\n\u201cLeasing velocity on Third Avenue has significantly increased this year, resulting in a notable shortage of large, high-quality availability,\u201d SL Green executive vice president Steven Durels said in a statement.\n\nIn November, the New York State Executive Chamber \u2014 or the Office of the Governor \u2014 signed a seven-year lease for 53,000 square feet on the building\u2019s 40th and 45th floors. The space was set to be used as Governor Kathy Hochul\u2019s personal office, as well as a press office and working space for her staff.\nThe Office of General Services explored potential leases at 40 buildings, touring 20 of them before picking 919 Third Avenue. At the time of the lease, it was said to be negotiating for more space, the result of which appears to be the latest deal.\nOther tenants at the building include law firm Schulte, Roth &amp; Zabel; law firm Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo; and\nBloomberg\n.\nIn the third quarter, tenants in Manhattan\nleased 9.4 million square feet\n, a 2 percent jump from the second quarter and almost 27 percent higher than the five-year quarterly average, according to a Colliers report. Leasing volume surpassed 30 million square feet for the full year, surging past pre-pandemic levels and representing the strongest period of year-to-date demand since 2002.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A group of unit owners hired brokers to sell their waterfront building in North Bay Village, near Related Group and Macklowe Properties\u2019 planned two-tower luxury condo tower project.\nNearly all of the Harbor Condominium owners tapped Blanca Commercial Real Estate and MSP Group to sell the 29-unit, circa-1951 building at 7909 to 7911 East Drive on Harbor Island, said Blanca\u2019s Cary Cohen, and Deme Mekras and Sam Mekras of MSP.\nThe 0.54-acre property is unpriced, but \u201cWe expect this to shatter the North Bay Village record,\u201d Cohen said. Deme Mekras said the current record for land sales is $744 per square foot, which would come out to more than $17.6 million.\nA developer could build 38 units and up to 150 feet tall, or about 15 stories; or up to 50 units with 195 feet of transferable development rights that the buyer could purchase from the city or a private seller, the brokers said.\nDeme Mekras said the property will be a short walk to the planned island walk promenade that\u2019ll be part of Sunbeam Properties\u2019 planned development.\u00a0 The billionaire Ansin family\u2019s Sunbeam Properties owns 14 acres in the village and plans to build a\n7.3 million-square-foot\ndevelopment with roughly 2,000 residential units, 300 hotel keys and commercial space.\n\u201cTo be walkable to that, it\u2019s going to be pretty special,\u201d he said.\nCondo associations that may have deferred maintenance, repairs and the full funding of their aging buildings for years are now playing catch-up, thanks to condo safety laws passed after the deadly condo collapse of Champlain Towers South in Surfside more than four years ago. The cost of insurance has also soared.\n\n\u201cRather than maintaining aging structures that require substantial capital investment, they are making the strategic decision to capitalize on the soaring value of their location,\u201d Cohen said in the release, adding in an interview that the association\u2019s monthly dues would create \u201cmore of a burden than a benefit.\u201d\nSome unit owners and associations have instead opted to sell their condos to developers in bulk.\nRelated and Macklowe bought out the owners of the Biscayne Sea Club co-op and the Majestic Isle condo building on the northern tip of Harbor Island, though both deals were previously tied up in litigation. The developers plan two nearly 500-foot condo towers on their assemblage of more than 4.1 acres. In July, North Bay Village commissioners\nunanimously passed\na zoning ordinance via a special area plan that will allow the project to move forward. Arquitectonica, led by Bernardo Fort Brescia, is the architect.\nOn the west side of Harbor Island, S2 Development recently sold the\n1-acre development site\nat 7913 West Drive to El-Ad National Properties. The waterfront lot is approved for a 22-story, 94-unit residential tower.\nNorth Bay Village, a three-island town sandwiched between Miami and Miami Beach, has a number of other residential and mixed-use projects planned.\nThe Eichner family\u2019s Continuum Company controls 4.5 acres in North Bay Village, including the former Shucker\u2019s and Best Western property. This summer, the commission unanimously\napproved\na special area plan, site plan and development agreement for the entire Continuum Waterfront District, which calls for two condo towers, a 200-key Continuum hotel and a marina. One tower can now be up to 440 feet tall.\nMikael Hamaoui\u2019s Riviera Horizons plans the 28-story, 70-unit\nPagani-branded condo tower\nat 7940 West Drive on Harbor Island, marking the first condo development for the Italian hypercar brand. Shoma Group plans Shoma Bay, a mixed-use condo tower with a Publix supermarket, at 1872 79th Street Causeway.\nDeveloper Vivian Dimond also took over a stalled\n21-story, 54-unit\ncondo project at 7918 West Drive on Harbor Island, with plans to complete the building next year.\n",

Instead, DOF capped their benefit at $16.5 million, citing outdated filing rules, according to the lawsuit.\nThe dispute turns on when the project \u201cofficially\u201d began.\nDanforth filed its first ICAP application in 2014, but the developer filed renewed permits in 2017. Over time, escalating costs from pandemic delays pushed the budget far past initial estimates.\n\nThe developers asked to shift the project\u2019s start date from 2015 to 2017 so the tax calculation would reflect its completion in 2023. DOF allegedly refused, saying the request relied on ICAP rules that didn\u2019t exist when the original application was filed.\nThat timing gap, the lawsuit claims, was the city\u2019s fault. The lawsuit stated that DOF waited nearly a decade after state and city lawmakers created ICAP in 2008 to finalize implementing regulations \u2014 a lag that the lawsuit says violated separation-of-powers principles and undermined the program\u2019s purpose.\nA DOF spokesperson defended the decision, saying the agency administers programs \u201cwithin the parameters established by state and local law.\u201d\nDanforth founder Steven Williams declined to comment to the outlet.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Walgreens Boots Alliance is shutting down its massive workspace in Chicago\u2019s Old Post Office and consolidating operations at its suburban Deerfield headquarters, the company confirmed Monday \u2014 a major reversal of its pre-pandemic urban expansion strategy.\nThe move was announced five weeks after Walgreens completed its $10 billion sale to New York private equity firm Sycamore Partners. In an email to employees, the new CEO Mike Motz said the company \u201cmust make bold, decisive choices to free up resources\u201d and that bringing its Chicago-area workforce under one roof would \u201cenhance collaboration\u201d and improve support for store teams, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nWalgreens plans to close the downtown office by the end of January. The company leased roughly 200,000 square feet at the Old Post Office at 433 West Van Buren Street in 2018 \u2014 a high-profile deal that helped kick off the building\u2019s transformation into a modern corporate hub. At the time, Walgreens said up to 1,800 employees could eventually work there, a symbol of its push to attract younger, tech-oriented talent in the city.\nThat vision never fully materialized. The Old Post Office lease runs through 2032, according to CoStar, and it\u2019s unclear whether Walgreens will sublease the space or negotiate an early exit. Either scenario would deal another blow to a downtown office market battered by record vacancies and rising distress.\nA spokeswoman for the building\u2019s owner, New York-based 601W Companies, declined to comment. In 2019,\n601W\ncompleted an $800 million overhaul of the Old Post Office building.\n\nThe Deerfield consolidation also fits into a broader downsizing trend for Walgreens\u2019 real estate footprint. Last year, the company sold 18 acres of its corporate campus to Atlanta-based homebuilder\nPulte Group\n, which is developing single-family homes on the site. A year ago, Walgreens began\nclosing\n1,200 of its 8,000 stores nationwide.\nMotz, a former Staples retail chief installed by Sycamore, is leading Walgreens through a sweeping restructuring after years of weak performance, mounting debt and failed bets on healthcare ventures such as\nVillageMD\n.\nThe company\u2019s breakup into five standalone private entities \u2014 including its core pharmacy chain, Boots Group in the U.K. and Shields Health Solutions \u2014 marks the most significant overhaul in its 120-year history.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The $30.5 million purchase price includes a one-space parking garage, according to the listing agents.\nThe 7,442-square-foot, four-bedroom and four-bathroom and two-half-bathroom condo\nwas asking $35.9 million\nwith Ruthie and Ethan Assouline and Eytan Namiech of the Assouline Team at Douglas Elliman.

She is board chairperson of the Lyric Opera of Chicago.\nThe previous record sale in Bal Harbour was also to a Chicago buyer. Two years ago, a hidden entity based in the Windy City paid $25 million for unit 2101, a 7,400-square-foot condo with six bedrooms, eight bathrooms and two half-bathrooms. The Assouline Team also brokered that deal.\nThe 28-story oceanfront tower includes a spa, two tennis courts, a library, pool and poolside restaurant.\n",

        "content": "The owners of\n3612 Crescent Avenue in Highland Park\nseemed to command the high ground of the Texas market last month. With an asking price of $18.5 million, the mansion, held by the family trust of a Stanford University trustee and a Morgan Stanley wealth manager, was the second-most expensive listing in the state. Located in one of Dallas\u2019 most desirable neighborhoods, the home has a top-performing Compass agent and glowing coverage in local media.\nThe rub? The home had already listed\nlast year\nfor $19.5 million, stalled, relisted in January and left the market in August before reentering with a $1 million price cut in September.\nThe Crescent Avenue mansion isn\u2019t alone. As the\nSun Belt shifts in favor of buyers\n, prices are lowering and market time is lengthening for Texas\u2019 most luxurious homes.\nWhile prices have risen nationally, luxury home transactions fell 0.7 percent to a 10-year low in August,\naccording to Redfin\n. In this metric, Texas is strongly outperforming Florida, which has undergone the most drastic change; luxury deals declined by 27 percent in West Palm Beach and 19 percent in Miami. Austin is the only major Texas metro to experience a decline in luxury trades, and its 0.4 percent fall is slightly shallower than the national average.\nHowever, Austin, Dallas and Fort Worth all chart higher-than-average days on market for homes above $1 million, and the price history of the state\u2019s top homes suggests that demand for ultra-luxury in Texas might be on the wane.\nIn Dallas,\nthe state\u2019s leading luxury metro\n, agents are optimistic about the general luxury class.\n\u201cThe $3 million-plus segment is thriving,\u201d said Bryan Pacholski, chief sales officer of Compass\u2019 Dallas office. Dallas/Fort Worth saw 338 luxury transactions in the second quarter of 2025 compared to 232 the prior year, according to Pacholski, amounting to a 46 percent increase year over year.\n\nThe lower stratum of luxury is more sensitive to lending, said Douglas Elliman agent Breah Brown, who calls North Texas luxury \u201cpretty resilient.\u201d\n\u201cInterest rates are affecting that first-home buyer, and here, that\u2019s around the $2 million, $2.5 million dollar mark. Of course, you\u2019ve got condos and stuff that are under a million, but first-home buyers are really in that range,\u201d Brown said.\nHowever, the ultra-luxury lane is noticeably slowing. Of the 40 most-expensive properties in Texas to list since June, only one has sold, according to the Houston Association of Realtors. The average luxury home sold in 46 days in August, three days slower than last year, according to Redfin. Most of the state\u2019s 40 priciest listings have already exceeded this average.\nFurthermore, the new listings aren\u2019t that new. September had a higher concentration of relistings compared to prior months. Along with 3612 Crescent Avenue, six other properties \u2014\n7031 Turtle Creek Boulevard\n, 4625 Walnut Hill and 4208 Beverly Drive in Dallas,\n412 Timberwilde Lane\nand a condo at 2555 North Pearl Street in Houston, and 2 Grand Colonial Drive in Spring \u2014 reentered the market in September. With an asking price of $9 million, 4625 Walnut Hill is the most serially marketed home of the set, having listed five times in the last 12 months.\nPrevious months didn\u2019t have this many relistings. None of the top 10 homes for sale in either May or June had listed before within the year, and July had just one relisting.\nSeveral sellers have decided to take their homes off the market altogether. The properties at 3648 Stratford Avenue and 3709 Euclid Avenue in Highland Park, 4905 Reserve Court in Parker, and 6 Estancia Place in Spring all failed to find a buyer, according to Zillow and county records.\nNationally,\nluxury listings increased 9.5 percent\nyear over year during the summer to their highest peak since 2020, accounting for seasonal trends, according to Redfin.\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s official: A long-stalled megadevelopment in Brooklyn has a new development team that will take over seven sites and, in a new twist, pay $12 million toward an affordable housing fund.\nA\njoint venture\nled by Cirrus Real Estate and LCOR has scooped up the remaining sites that make up Pacific Park, a massive project that was launched\nmore than two decades ago\n. Through a foreclosure auction on Tuesday, the joint venture took over the development rights to six rail yard sites, after Greenland USA defaulted on nearly $350 million in loans tied to the properties.\nBeyond Cirrus and LCOR, the joint venture taking over the sites includes U.S. Immigration Fund and Fortress, but those firms won\u2019t have an active role in managing the development.\u00a0Terms of the project restructuring were not immediately available. USIF confirmed the deal Tuesday afternoon.\nAhead of the auction, the state blessed Cirrus and LCOR as new developers of the sites, which include the rail yard properties \u2014 to be developed once platforms are built over the tracks between Pacific Street and Atlantic Avenue \u2014 and another located near the Barclays Center, known as site 5. Greenland is still part of the joint venture that will develop that site.\nThe latter was not included in Tuesday\u2019s auction and is being transferred through a separate, private deal.\nAs part of an agreement with the state, the joint venture will pay $12 million toward an affordable housing fund, of which $4.5 million would be paid upfront, according to state officials. The money, which will be paid in installments, is intended to fill in for penalties that were supposed to kick in when the current\ndeveloper\n, Greenland USA, failed to finish the project\u2019s remaining 876 affordable apartments by May 2025. Under a 2014 agreement, failing to meet that construction deadline meant the developer must pay $2,000 per unfinished unit for every month that the apartments went without a temporary certificate of occupancy.\nBut Empire State Development, the state agency overseeing the project, halted those fines and\ntied them to new deadlines\n, the first of which was quickly missed.\nStill, the agency once again\ndeclined\nto enforce the penalties, citing concerns that Greenland would sue over the fines and further delay the project.\nThe $12 million payment isn\u2019t as much as would likely have been collected if the 2014 agreement were enforced (a two-year delay on all the units would result in a $42 million fine, for example). Elected officials and BrooklynSpeaks, an advocacy group that was party to the 2014 agreement, have railed against the state\u2019s decision not to enforce the penalties, viewing it as a betrayal of the community\u2019s trust.\nIn this next phase of the project, ESD plans to set new benchmarks for the project. If a memorandum of understanding outlining the project isn\u2019t signed by July 31, 2026, the state agency could still collect the damages described in the 2014 agreement, dating back to June 1. Those damages would take the $12 million payment installments into account.\nA decades-long project\nThe mixed-use development has been in limbo for several years. First proposed in 2003 with the name Atlantic Yards, Greenland began taking over the then-long-stalled project in 2014 and rebranded it Pacific Park. The rail yard \u2014\u00a0a key part of the \u201cblight\u201d that empowered the state to take over the sites through eminent domain and lease them out to developers \u2014 went untouched, and concerns over Greenland\u2019s ability to finish the project mounted.\n\nIn 2022, Greenland\ndefaulted\non $350 million tied to the rail yard sites from Nick Mastroianni\u2019s USIF, which raised the capital through the cash-for-visas EB-5 program. Fortress Investment Group also owns a stake in the debt.\nThe fact that ESD has approved the joint venture and that the development rights have been transferred for the six sites means that the project can enter the next phase \u2014 whatever that may look like.\u00a0The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has also signed off on the team, which has agreed to make annual payments of $11 million related to air rights tied to the rail yards.\nThe new developers have indicated that they want to make changes to the earlier plans, which called for more than 6,400 apartments, 2,250 of which would be set aside as below market-rate. So far, nine buildings (including the Barclays Center) have been completed as part of the project, with more than 3,200 apartments built, by original developers Forest City Ratner, Greenland USA and other developers who, over the years, have taken over individual sites.\nUSIF\u2019s Nick Mastroianni said he expects the plan to be reworked and finalized over the next year and half. The first phase, which involves building the first of two platforms over the rail yards, will cost an estimated $4 billion and take roughly five years to complete, he said. The second phase will cost another $2 billion. He said the development team has \u201cideas on how to bring the affordable housing\u00a0to reality sooner rather than later,\u201d but wouldn\u2019t share details on what the team envisions for the site. He noted that\nsome of the sites\nwill qualify for the now-expired property tax break 421a.\nMastroianni described the transfer of the sites as a turning point for the project and its EB-5 investors.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve now advanced the project so that we can develop, and the development will be the trigger for the [loan] repayment on a unit by unit basis,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a light at the end of the tunnel for the return of their capital.\u201d\nWhat comes next\nChanges to the plan will require amendments to the state\u2019s general project plan, a method outside the city\u2019s land use process that lays out the parameters of a project. ESD indicated that it will kick off a public engagement process to discuss the development team\u2019s proposals in the coming months.\nIf the history of Pacific Park is any indication, that process will be tense: The project has been held up as an example of what happens when developers promise big, fail to deliver and then walk away unscathed. BrooklynSpeaks has called for deeper affordability levels than originally planned.\nOther suitors circled Pacific Park, including\nRelated Companies\n. Cirrus\nconfirmed\nin January that it was pursuing the project, and LCOR emerged a few months later.\nCirrus has said that it will lead capitalization on the project, and LCOR comes in as an experienced multifamily developer. Cirrus\u2019 website provides little information about the company\u2019s development experience, but the firm\u2019s principals collectively have overseen \u201c$150 billion in real estate finance transactions, $10 billion in real estate equity investments and more than 10,000 multifamily units,\u201d according to a company spokesperson.\nCirrus has seen its portfolio of projects in the city grow since reaching an agreement last year with the Building and Construction Trades Council and City Hall to invest $100 million in multifamily workforce housing and redevelopments by pooling pension funds from more than a dozen construction unions. The fund, which raised $300 million as of July, will help finance development at Pacific Park, as well as workforce housing at a\ndefunct airport\nin Queens and tens of thousands of units of housing as part of an agreement with Resorts World Casino New York City.\nLCOR, which is also working with Cirrus on the Queens project, oversees a portfolio of 10,000 multifamily units and 2.4 million square feet of commercial space, according to the firm\u2019s website. Cirrus is led by Joseph McDonnell, who was formerly head of real estate at BlueMountain Capital, and Tony Tufariello, who served as head of real estate finance at Morgan Stanley and head of global real estate at Fortress, which is also part of the joint venture.\n",

        "content": "Morgan Properties bought a 300-unit apartment complex near West Palm Beach for nearly $70 million, amid an uptick in South Florida multifamily investment sales.\nConshohoken, Pennsylvania-based Morgan purchased the gated garden-style property at 4860 Sand Stone Lane in unincorporated Palm Beach County from Miami-based Bar Invest Group, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The deal breaks down to $233,167 per unit.\nThe buyer paid $69.95 million for the complex and financed it with a $49.9 million Freddie Mac loan.\nThe complex, called Visions at Willow Pond, consists of 17 two-story and three-story apartment buildings, a clubhouse and one warehouse, Vizzda records show. It was completed in 1986 and 1987 on a 30.4-acre site.\nBar Invest, a major South Florida multifamily landlord, had paid $56.2 million for the property in 2020, according to records. Bar Invest is led by Herve Barbera.\nMultifamily investment firm Morgan, led by Mitchell Morgan, has been ramping up its apartment purchases nationwide this year. After it purchased an 11-property portfolio with more than 3,000 apartments in eight states for\n$501 million\nin April, its total multifamily holdings topped 100,000 units nationwide.\nIn August, Morgan reached a deal to purchase a majority stake in Toronto-based publicly traded Dream Residential REIT for $10.80 per share, or about\n$354 million\n. After the purchase, which is expected to close by year-end, Dream will go private.\n\nMorgan is considered the largest private multifamily owner in the U.S.\nIn South Florida, Morgan owns the 180-unit Tuscany Pointe at Somerset Place at 23126 Post Gardens Way near Boca Raton; the 191-unit Savannah Place at 22356 Calibre Court near Boca Raton; the 202-unit Royal St. George at the Villages at 1441 Brandywine Road in West Palm Beach; and Village Place at 2111 Brandywine Road in West Palm Beach, according to the firm\u2019s website.\nSeveral South Florida multifamily investment sales have closed in recent months, after a slowdown during the past two years due to elevated interest rates and more skittish lenders. The tri-county region had become a magnet for newcomers during the pandemic, which had prompted unprecedented apartment demand and record rent growth. The in-migration slowed just as developers also completed a record number of units last year, slowing lease-ups and increasing concessions.\nDuring the pandemic, Palm Beach County apartment investment sales reached $3.8 billion in 2021 and $1.8 billion in 2022, according to data from Avison Young. This dropped to $668 million in 2023 and $1 billion last year. Multifamily investment sales for the first half of this year in the county totaled $120.6 million, the Avison data shows.\nMany of the buyers still purchasing are relying on Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae loans, which usually offer better terms than bank financing.\nThis month, Tishman Speyer paid\n$124.5 million\nfor the 270-unit Bell at Broken Sound Apartments at 5500 Broken Sound Boulevard Northwest and 950 Northwest Broken Sound Parkway in Boca Raton. The buyer financed the purchase with a $78.4 million Fannie Mae loan.\nIn July, Brookfield Properties bought the 444-unit Turtle Cove complex at 825 Cotton Bay Drive East in unincorporated Palm Beach County for\n$107.5 million\n. The deal was part of Brookfield\u2019s $1.6 billion purchase of a 7,300-unit portfolio of 23 properties from Miami Beach-based Starwood Capital Group.",

        "content": "The Big Ten Network is looking to switch studios nearly two decades after it first went on the air from a converted warehouse along the Chicago River.\nThe college sports broadcaster is exploring a move from 600 West Chicago Avenue, the 1.6 million-square-foot former Montgomery Ward complex, according to people familiar with the plans and first reported by\nCoStar\n.\nThe network, which leases about 58,000 square feet in the building, is weighing options of similar size at two high-profile downtown locations: Prudential Plaza, overlooking Millennium Park, and 350 North Orleans Street, near the Merchandise Mart. Savills broker Robert Sevim is representing the network in the search.\nThe Big Ten Network hasn\u2019t commented publicly on its next move.\nThe network\u2019s building recently changed hands. Arizona-based 3Edgewood, the real estate firm led by former Phoenix Suns owner\nRobert Sarver\n, bought 600 West Chicago earlier this year for just $89 million \u2014 a steep drop from its $510 million sale price in 2018. The firm is pitching upgrades like outdoor terraces, bars, and a rooftop deck to lure tenants amid rising vacancy.\n\nAny relocation would mark a major shift for the Big Ten Network, which debuted in 2007 as the first college sports\nconference-owned\nTV channel, broadcasting football, basketball and dozens of Olympic sports from its Chicago studios. The network has since grown alongside the conference, which ballooned from 11 to 18 teams after recent expansions into the West Coast.\nThe two options reflect differing strategies in a struggling office market. The property at 350 North Orleans Street has been in receivership since\nBlackstone\nhanded back the keys last year when its $310 million loan came due. Receiver Trigild and leasing agent Lincoln Property Company are seeking tenants as the building\u2019s appraised value plummeted to $87.4 million from $489 million in 2018.\nPrudential Plaza owner Wanxiang America Real Estate, on the other hand, recently negotiated a loan extension through 2027 \u2014 at 130 East Randolph Street and 180 North Stetson Avenue \u2014 pledging more than $50 million in\nupgrades\n, landing tenants including ComPsych, HOK, AECOM and Howard &amp; Howard.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The artificial intelligence boom in the Bay Area is driving demand for more than just apartments for incoming workers.\nAs AI barons move into town, the San Francisco real estate market is experiencing a shortage of mansions, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. Luxury listings that once sat on the market for months are now drawing multiple offers within days.\nTake a 5,000-square-foot\nmansion in the tony Pacific Heights neighborhood\nthat went into contract last month with a sale price of about $9.4 million. It\u2019s roughly the same price it sold for eight years ago, but at the time, nearly four months passed before an offer came in.\n\u201cIt was a difficult house at the time,\u201d luxury broker Peter Rodway, senior partner at Neal Ward Properties who worked to sell the Jackson Street home in 2017 and now, said of the property. \u201cThis time, buyers were just banging at the doors to get into it. An offer came in on the first day, at full price.\u201d\nAI startups\nare growing, stock options are turning into cash and high-paid tech workers are returning to the \u2014 all ramping up demand in the high-end market.\n\u201cThe future wealth in AI is out and touring homes right now. Some of them are touring $2 million condos. Some of them are touring $20 million houses. That wealth effect is going to continue to help drive demand,\u201d Gregg Lynn, a luxury agent with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, said.\n\u201cThe city is just flush with cash right now \u2014 and there\u2019s not enough inventory to keep up with it,\u201d Rodway added.\n\nSales for luxury homes are up 14 percent year-over-year in San Francisco, according to Redfin data cited by the Chronicle. Inventory, meanwhile, is down by about 4.5 percent year-over-year.\nFor the months of June through August, total\nhome sales\nregardless of price were up by 4.2 percent compared to the same period last year. This September saw a massive uptick from the same month last year, with overall home sales last month in San Francisco being up 35 percent year-over-year.\nAdditionally, San Francisco was the only county in the Bay Area to see a year-over-year increase in its \u201cpending ratio,\u201d which compares demand versus supply.\n\u201cSan Francisco\u2019s pending ratio leapt higher by 15 percentage points, an enormous rise. We ascribe the large shifts in the market to its rapidly accelerating AI startup boom,\u201d Patrick Carlisle, chief market analyst at Compass, said. October could be even bigger, as it\u2019s \u201ctypically the big month in fall for closed luxury sales\u201d in San Francisco. As it stands, 15 sales of homes over $5 million are pending and expected to close this month.\nCBRE predicts\nthe explosion of AI will bring more than 50,000 tech workers to San Francisco by the end of the decade. Just how much AI juices the once-slumping San Francisco market in the coming years remains to be seen.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",
