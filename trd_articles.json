        "content": "Former top Adams aide Ingrid Lewis-Martin and Jesse Hamilton, who oversees the city\u2019s office leases, face charges for steering city contracts to specific real developers and helping fast-track their projects in exchange for personal home renovations and other perks.\nFour new indictments accuse Lewis-Martin of accepting $75,000 in bribes between March 2022 and November 2024, as part of a wide-ranging scheme involving eight co-defendents, including Hamilton, who is the deputy commissioner of real estate services at the Department of Citywide Administrative Services.\u00a0Hamilton is named in one of the four indictments.\nMost of the bribe money, $50,000, was directed to an account run by her son, Glenn Martin II, according to the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office. Other alleged bribes were less conventional, including thousands of dollars worth of catered food at Gracie Mansion and a speaking role on a television show.\nLewis-Martin, who resigned last year as Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 chief aide, was already\nindicted\nin December on charges that she intervened on behalf of hoteliers seeking construction approvals in exchange for more than $100,000 in bribes to her and her son.\nMuch like the first set of charges, the latest indictments center around the city\u2019s dealings with private real estate companies. The complaints accuse Lewis-Martin using her position in the Adams administration to help out developers Tian Ji Li and Yechiel Landau.\nAccording to one of the new indictments, Lewis-Martin pushed Hamilton and other city officials to direct contracts for asylum seeker shelter sites to property owners favored by developer Tian Ji Li. As part of his arrangement with the property owners, Li received 10 percent of the contract\u2019s value. In February 2023, the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation entered\u00a0 a $12 million licensing agreement with one of the owners, netting Li $1.2 million, according to the indictment. He allegedly transferred $50,000 worth of that haul to Martin II\u2019s account.\nThe indictment describes Lewis-Martin pressuring Hamilton, who helped oversee the selection of sites, to consider the properties preferred by Li. On May 25, 2024, Lewis-Martin called Hamilton to make this clear: \u201cI want you all to go back to the sites for TJ Li\u2026I need those done\u2026whatever site TJ wants, I need him to get them. Because that\u2019s our fucking people,\u201d she said, according to the indictment.\nShe called back a few days later to say: \u201cCan you make sure that when I\u2019m sending you a fucking site, [John Doe # 2] finds the site I fucking send you,\u201d the indictment details. Hamilton allegedly confirmed to Lewis-Martin in a June 25 call: \u201cTJ, he\u2019s, he\u2019s first. He\u2019s first in line.\u201d\nLewis-Martin also allegedly helped speed up approvals for a karaoke bar Li was building in Queens.\nAnother indictment accuses Lewis-Martin of intervening on behalf of developer Yechiel Landau on a project at 498 Columbia Street in Red Hook, 1211 Southern Boulevard in the Bronx, and an unidentified apartment complex in Jamaica, Queens.\nAt the Bronx property, Lewis-Martin allegedly put pressure on HPD to get the agency\u2019s approval to refinance and buy out a previous investor on the city-subsidized property. The agency signed off on Landau\u2019s takeover of the property before it assigned a project manager to work with him to ensure the preservation of affordable housing at the building, according to the indictment.\nIn exchange for Lewis-Martin\u2019s help, Landau allegedly paid for more than $5,000 worth of renovation work at her home.\u00a0 At the time, her sister had been living with her and needed a place to stay while the work was being done, according to the indictment. Hamilton agreed to let her sister stay on a lower level of his house, which Landau paid to have cleaned and repainted to accommodate the move, prosecutors allege.\nThe indictment describes messages between the three on encrypted messaging app Signal on July 12, 2023 as Lewis-Martin simultaneously tried to get other city officials to focus on the Red Hook project.\nLewis-Martin asked then-Deputy Mayor of Housing and Economic Opportunity Maria Torres-Springer to \u201czip out\u201d of a meeting with Mayor Eric Adams about hate crimes to join a call with the Department of Housing Preservation and Development \u201cfor a hot minute to just give your blessings.\u201d\nShe immediately followed up with: \u201cI know the mayor is major priority, but if you could skip out for second. They had been bugging the stuffings out of me,\u201d according to the indictment.\n\nTwo minutes later, she messaged Landau, saying that Torres-Springer\u2019s chief of staff joined the call with HPD. She also assured him: \u201cI promise you that your project is priority,\u201d she wrote, according to the indictment.\nEight minutes later, Landau messaged Lewis-Martin and her son, lamenting that an HPD employee was \u201cgiving push back\u201d on the project\u2019s financing closing in December. The residential project was going to be developed using various\ncity subsidy programs\nfor senior and low-income housing.\nLewis-Martin\u2019s son, who is accused of serving as an intermediary, allegedly responded with \u201cF*** him we make it close.\u201d\nThe indictment describes Lewis-Martin speaking to the deputy mayor and then sending multiple text messages \u2014\u00a0sometimes several in one day \u2014 to then-HPD Commissioner Adolfo Carri\u00f3n demanding to know what was holding up the project.\n\u201cI need to know what they are missing which is preventing them from moving forward. Thank you,\u201d she sent on July 28, 2023, according to the indictment.\nThe next day she followed up with: \u201cWe need to get it done,\u201d and then adding, \u201cDecember.\u201d\nShe also asked Carri\u00f3n to send a document detailing \u201cthe order of the projects,\u201d referring to HPD\u2019s pipeline, according to the indictment.\nLewis-Martin also allegedly met with Landau and his personal consultant on the project without HPD. She told the two: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna, we gotta get that place [HPD] under control, so when we [expletive] tell them something, we expect them to make that shit move\u2026 I\u2019m gonna speak to the Mayor, and then that\u2019s it, so we\u2019re just gonna push for December [2024] and we\u2019re gonna keep it going,\u201d according to the indictment.\nThe project closed in December, despite the fact that \u201chundreds of projects are in HPD\u2019s pipeline, but only a few are able to close each calendar year,\u201d a press release from the Manhattan District Attorney and Department of Investigations notes.\nOn September 11, 2023, Lewis-Martin sent a text message to Hamilton alluding to the renovations planned at her home: \u201cAh, we will get it done. I called my contractors to advise,\u201d according to the indictment.\nIn October 2023, Lewis-Martin texted her sister: \u201cI am excited that soon you will live in a quality home. You are deserving. Jesse\u2019s place will be ready for your review. It needs paint but we just need it clean\u2026 I told them we needed to move you in ASAP. Just have it clean.\u201d\nAnother indictment accuses Lewis-Martin of conspiring with Gina and Anthony Argento, the owners of the film and production studio Broadway Stages, to get the Department of Transportation to change its planned redesign of McGuinness Boulevard in Brooklyn, which would have added protected bike lanes. The Argentos opposed the plan, not wanting vehicle traffic to be reduced near Broadway Stages.\nIn exchange for Lewis-Martin\u2019s help, the Argentos allegedly paid her $2500, spent $10,000 to cater an event at Gracie Mansion and provided her a speaking role on the TV show, \u201cGodfather of Harlem.\u201d Anthony Argento also allegedly promised to be her agent and to get her more roles on that show as well as another, \u201cBlue Bloods.\u201d\nThe indictments come as the mayor faces an uphill battle to re-election. Adams was able to\nshed\nhis own criminal charges this year, but his inner circle has not been so lucky.\nNews surfaced nearly a year ago that state investigators were looking into Lewis-Martin and Hamilton. In October, state officials had\nseized the phones\nof Lewis-Martin, Hamilton and Cushman &amp; Wakefield broker Diana Boutross as they returned from a vacation in Japan.\n",

        "content": "Taconic Partners and National Real Estate Advisors have inked a deal to bring the discount supermarket chain Aldi to Midtown.\nThe German grocer signed a lease for 25,000 square feet at the\nnew luxury rental building\nat 312 West 43rd Street, known as The Ellery. The flagship location will have an entrance on 42nd Street and is expected to open next year, according to the landlord.\nCBRE\u2019s Lon Rubackin, Michael Kadosh and Bevan Cohen represented the landlord in the deal. Ripco Real Estate\u2019s Esther Bukai represented Aldi.\nThe deal comes on the heels of Aldi announcing plans to open more than 225 stores in the U.S. this year. Last year, Aldi opened nearly 120 stores, bringing the total number of locations to over 2,400 and making it the third-largest grocery chain by store count in the U.S. The openings this year are part of a five-year plan by Aldi to add 800 locations in total by the end of 2028.\n\nThe grocer currently has locations in East Harlem, the Bronx and three in Brooklyn, according to its website.\nThe developers took over the Times Square-adjacent property in 2018 via a 99-year ground lease. The site used to be the headquarters of the 1199SEIU union. In 2022, they landed a $204 million construction loan from Union Labor Life Insurance Company to build a 32-story, 330-unit building. Taconic was also part of a big neighboring project as well, locking in $200 million of long-term debt alongside Mitsui Fudosan America for 525 West 52nd Street in 2019.\nLeasing for The Ellery kicked off 11 months ago and the building is fully leased, according to the landlord. In addition to the retail space, the Handel Architects-designed building will have spa areas, private gardens, workspaces and a pool on the rooftop.\n",

        "content": "Capital Commercial Investments now has a matching set.\nThe Austin-based firm picked up Energy Crossing I in West Houston after purchasing its companion building Energy Crossing II in November, according to a release from JLL, which represented the seller.\nAccording to deed records, the seller was Dallas-based Invesco Real Estate.\nThe three-story, 240,000-square foot Energy Crossing I, at 15021 Katy Freeway, was built in 2010. Energy Crossing II, an eight-story, 327,000-square-foot 15011 Katy Freeway, was built in 2014. At the time of the trade, it was about 30 percent occupied. The seller of Energy Crossing II was also Invesco Real Estate.\nEnergy Crossing I\u2019s most recent appraisal valued the building at $17.25 million, while its counterpart logged an appraisal of $23.5 million.\nThe office park sits on more than 5 acres and features an on-site fitness center.\n\nBoth properties are located in the middle of Houston\u2019s popular Energy Corridor. The submarket has recently attracted tenants like DNV USA, which\nsigned a deal for 63,000 square feet\nat the Offices at Greenhouse, another Capital Commercial Investments-owned property.\nAs a result, its vacancy rate was 21.5 percent at the end of the first quarter, according to a report from Partners Real Estate.\nDoug Agarwal\u2019s Capital Commercial Investments has recently been focused on reviving suburban office properties in Dallas and Houston. In addition to Energy Crossing I and II, the firm purchased the Offices at Greenhouse, at 19219 Katy Freeway, last summer, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n.\nWhen it purchased Energy Crossing II, Capital Commercial Investments said it intended to capitalize on the flight to quality trend gripping the office market.\nAt the end of the second quarter, vacancy at properties built in the last 15 years averaged 14.9 percent, compared to 27.5 percent in properties constructed before 2009. The numbers reflect tenants\u2019 effort to lure employees back to the office with space in new buildings.\n",

That pace is higher than any year since 2018, when monthly evictions peaked at about 1,666 per month.\nThere are approximately 2.2 million rental units in the city.\nThe jump in evictions comes as housing courts grind through a backlog of cases filed after the pandemic moratorium lifted in 2022. The easing of clogged housing courts appears to be fueling the spike in evictions.\nAnn Korchak of Small Property Owners of New York argued that eviction is \u201ca last resort,\u201d but necessary to keep buildings solvent.\nThe ones profiting the most from the evictions may be city marshals: 29 officers brought in nearly $20.5 million combined last year, up from $14 million in 2019.\n\nSince 2021, landlords have filed nearly half a million eviction cases citywide. The greatest share of those have been in the Bronx, where more than 9 percent of households received court notices last year. Fewer than 10 percent of filings result in a formal eviction order, but the process can take months or years to resolve, leaving tenants and landlords in limbo.\nAmid the rise in eviction actions this year, eviction filings have slowed. Landlords have launched about 9,500 cases a month in 2025, down from 10,500 over the same period last year.\nAnalysts say legal protections like the city\u2019s right-to-counsel program have blunted the damage for tenants, but those safety nets remain uneven. Many households earn just above income thresholds, while others who qualify can\u2019t get help fast enough.\n\u201cOne financial shock can be the precipitating factor for an eviction case,\u201d Peter Hepburn of Princeton\u2019s Eviction Lab told Gothamist.\nThe Robin Hood Foundation warned last month that one in four low-income New Yorkers can\u2019t reliably cover rent, leaving many \u201cone financial shock\u201d away from eviction. Housing advocates say the ripple effects extend far beyond individual families, destabilizing schools, employers and neighborhoods, not to mention their landlords.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The company leased the entirety of the 105,000-square-foot building owned by West Tasman Drive 10, an affiliate of Copia Lending.\nThe\nCopia Lending affiliate foreclosed\non the building\u2019s delinquent loan and seized the property last October. The lender estimated the office building\u2019s value at $23.7 million, placing it 53.8 percent below the property\u2019s assessed value in January 2024.\nSan Jose-based entity called Heritage 10 West Tasman bought the building in 2021 for $30 million. It filed for bankruptcy to try to avoid foreclosure and the loss of the building. The entity said the building was vacant for years, and it had a hard time securing a tenant to move in,\nper\nthe Mercury News.\n\nThe Archer Aviation lease adds to its growing presence in town. The company now operates three large work hubs in north San Jose all within a few blocks of each other. That includes its headquarters at 190 West Tasman \u2014 down the street from its latest new office \u2014 and 77 Rio Robles, which it leased in 2023.\nArcher is looking at using the Bay Area as its testing grounds for its electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles, which are similar to helicopters. Last year, it announced plans to create an \u201curban air mobility network,\u201d featuring takeoff and landing locations in South San Francisco, Napa, San Jose, Oakland and Livermore.

The hotel will occupy the upper stories, with separate elevators serving each use.\n\nThe apartments will include 39 studios, 52 one-bedrooms and 39 two-bedrooms, with just 59 of the units leased at market rates, per city ordinance. The developer has already lined up $20 million in state housing tax credits over the next decade and intends to pursue federal historic tax credits, city incentives and tax increment financing district funds to help finance the project. Construction, pegged at $90 million, is slated to start early next year and wrap by 2028.\nThe redevelopment is a pivot from prior plans. Current owner\nNewcrestImage\nbought the Magnolia in 2021 with ambitions for a high-end redo, including a potential Waldorf Astoria hotel location and a three-story addition, but that never materialized. Sycamore is now under contract to buy the property from the Grapevine-based firm, with Davidson Bogel Real Estate and attorney Philip Kingston advising on the deal.\nOriginally the headquarters for Magnolia Petroleum when it opened in 1922, the building was the tallest west of the Mississippi at the time and a symbol of Dallas\u2019 early oil-fueled growth. Its Pegasus, installed in 1934, has long been one of Downtown Dallas\u2019 most recognizable icons. In 2022 the Dallas City Council footed the\n$358,000 bill\nto secure and repair the 30-ton sign\u2019s eroding steel supports to prevent a fall.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Jesse Hamilton, a political protege of Mayor Eric Adams who oversaw the city\u2019s office leases, has stepped down.\nHamilton resigned Thursday after being\nindicted\non a conspiracy charge related to allegedly working with Ingrid Lewis-Martin, a former top aide to the mayor, to speed up certain developers\u2019 projects and steer city contracts to preferred players. As deputy commissioner of real estate services for the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, Hamilton handled the city\u2019s 400 leases at private properties, spanning more than 22 million square feet, though that responsibility was shifted away from him late last year.\nIn a statement, DCAS Commissioner Louis Molina said his agency\u2019s focus is \u201cunwavering.\u201d\n\u201cDCAS is the backbone of city government, and bearing that weight has never fallen upon just one person,\u201d he said. \u201cJesse Hamilton has tendered his resignation, and I\u2019ve accepted it, effective today.\u201d\nRafael Carvalho, formerly the chief of staff to the executive deputy commissioner for asset and property management, has been named acting deputy commissioner.\nHamilton joined DCAS in August 2022 as legal counsel and quickly rose through the ranks. The leasing deals he oversaw drew increased scrutiny after state officials\nseized\nhis phone in 2024, along with those of Lewis-Martin and Cushman &amp; Wakefield broker Diana Boutross as they returned from a trip together in September.\n\nThat fall, DCAS restructured its real estate division and reassigned the authority to execute leases to Shameka Overton, executive deputy commissioner for asset and property management, according to the agency.\nThe indictments released Thursday accuse Hamilton of playing a role in an alleged scheme that helped fast-track developer Yechiel Landau\u2019s projects. He also allegedly tried to use his authority at DCAS to steer a city contract to a Queens apartment building that ultimately didn\u2019t come to fruition. A separate indictment, which doesn\u2019t name him as a defendant, also describes Lewis Martin directing Hamilton to prioritize property owners hand-picked by developer Tian Ji Li for city contracts for asylum seeker shelters.\nHamilton is named as a defendant in one indictment, but Lewis-Martin faces charges in all four indictments that were released Thursday. The two, along with six other co-defendants, have pleaded not guilty.\nEarlier in his career, Hamilton worked as legal counsel to Adams when he was a state Senator. When Adams left the legislature to become the Brooklyn borough president, many saw Hamilton as his hand-picked successor. He served two terms representing the 20th District in Brooklyn.\nIn a statement, Adams, who is already facing a difficult path to re-election, emphasized that he has not been accused of wrongdoing and said his \u201ccommitment to New Yorkers is unwavering.\u201d Federal corruption charges previously brought against the mayor were\ndropped\nin April.\n\u201cWhile Ingrid Lewis-Martin no longer works for this administration, she has been a friend and colleague for over 40 years, and I know her as a devoted public servant; she has declared her innocence, and my prayers are with her and her family,\u201d the mayor said in a statement.\nAs for Hamilton, Adams noted his not guilty plea, adding, \u201clike anyone accused, he is entitled to the presumption of innocence.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Michael Shvo\u2019s firm is going on the attack against Core Club.\nAfter the members-only club sued Shvo for $600 million last year, an entity tied to Shvo is seeking $178 million from Core Club in a new lawsuit filed in California.\nShvo alleges the ritzy social club failed to approve design plans required to build out the club\u2019s space at the Transamerica Pyramid, leading to delays. Shvo alleges Core Club\u2019s lack of action and delays constituted a default. And in November 2024, Shvo ultimately terminated Core Club\u2019s lease.\nNow, Shvo and his partners allege Core Club owes $178 million for payments owed on the remainder of Core Club\u2019s 20-year lease.\nThe social club was set to be a key tenant for Shvo\u2019s revamp of the Transamerica building and Shvo\u2019s office building at 711 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. Instead, the two have traded barbs in New York State court. Things heated up even more this week after Shvo initiated an\neviction\nof Core Club in the Fifth Avenue building.\nCore Club fired the first shots, claiming Shvo over-promised and under-delivered on opening three club locations with plans to spend $100 million on a buildout. Shvo\u2019s side responded, calling the lawsuit a public hit job, intended to get Core a rent reduction.\nShvo and his German partners, including the pension fund BVK, made a big splash buying the historic 48-story Transamerica Pyramid in 2020 for $650 million. Shvo undertook a $250 million renovation to modernize San Francisco\u2019s iconic tower. The purchase was part of a larger acquisition and development spree by Shvo, which included buying the former Coca-Cola building in Manhattan and building an ultra-luxury hotel and condo project in Miami Beach known as\nThe Raleigh\n.\n\nBut Shvo\u2019s high-end portfolio has faced recent\nchallenges\n. Construction at The Raleigh has stalled and it could be sold for $275 million. Shvo sold its luxury condo project in Beverly Hills after 10 sales in three years, the Wall Street Journal reported. Separately, Shvo has filed an arbitration claim, alleging he is owed more than $85 million in fees from the German pension fund BVK.\nThe Transamerica Pyramid was among Shvo\u2019s boldest bets. Shvo finalized the deal in 2020, as Covid forced employees to work from home. Core Club, a high-end members-only club, inked a lease in 2021, which would be offered as an amenity to office tenants.\n\u201cAfter years of failed commitments in both San Francisco and New York, the ownership of the Transamerica Pyramid has lost patience with Core Club,\u201d said Morris Missry of Wachtel Missry, an attorney for the Shvo entity. \u201cWe have tried to resolve this and to keep Core Club in the building, but it is now clear that Core Club is unwilling and/or unable to meet its obligations, and legal action is the only option to enforce the lease.\u201d\n\u201cIt is incredible that Mr. Shvo, who reneged on his promise to fund and build a luxury space for Core in the Transamerica Building due to his own lack of the resources, now seeks rent from Core for the very facility he failed to deliver,\u201d said Marc Kasowitz of the law firm Kasowitz.\nKasowitz said Core believes the project was a \u201cruse\u201d and will assert counterclaims for damages suffered as a result of \u201cShvo\u2019s failure to deliver\u201d the Core Club in San Francisco.\nA New York state judge recently ordered Core Club to pay Shvo close to\n$1 million\nover a loan Shvo provided in 2022. Core Club is appealing the ruling.\n",

        "content": "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\u2019 real estate investment arm picked up a 384-unit apartment complex in Boca Raton for $152.5 million.\nThe deal marks the church\u2019s continuing investment in South Florida properties over the past two years. The religious institution has made the purchases through Property Reserve, which invests church reserve funds in commercial real estate.\nSalt Lake City, Utah-based Property Reserve bought the Del Ola complex at 7801 North Federal Highway from an affiliate of New York-based Clarion Partners, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The deal breaks down to over $397,100 per unit.\nCompleted in 2012 and 2013, Del Ola consists of 19 three-story apartment buildings, a two-story clubhouse and five one-story garages on a 17.4-acre site, Vizzda and Palm Beach County records show. Clarion Partners, led by David Gilbert, had paid $120.8 million for the complex in 2019.\nDel Ola has one-bedroom to three-bedroom apartments, with monthly rents ranging from $2,169 to $4,802, according to its website.\nProperty Reserve, led by Ashley Powell, has purchased at least three properties in South Florida since 2023.\nIt owns the 1.3 million-square-foot Beacon Logistics Park, an industrial campus on 75 acres in Hialeah. It purchased it from developers Codina Partners and Affinius Capital in several deals. In 2023, Property Reserve paid\n$174.3 million\nfor several buildings and outparcels at Beacon Logistics and\n$55.8 million\nfor another warehouse.\n\nLast year, it bought the eight-story, 315-unit Ellsworth apartment building at 1301 Southwest 80th Terrace in Plantation for\n$133 million\n; as well as the 284-unit Elan Polo Gardens at 4310 Chukka Lane in unincorporated Palm Beach County, near Wellington, for\n$102.4 million\n.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has faced criticism over its massive real estate holdings, construction of\ngrandiose temples\nand opaque financials, allowed by limited public disclosure requirements. In 2023, the church and its investment manager, Ensign Peak Advisors, settled for $1 million and $4 million, respectively, over the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s claims the church\u2019s portfolio was obscured through about a dozen limited liability companies. The church and Ensign neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing in the settlement.\nFarmland Reserve, another investment arm for the church, last year paid\n$289 million\nfor 46 farms nationwide, including in Florida, the New York Post reported.\nSouth Florida\nmultifamily\ninvestment sales are experiencing an uptick in recent months, despite elevated interest rates, a slowdown of demand and lease-ups, and flat \u2013\u2013 and even declining \u2013\u2013 rent growth.\nMany of those still buying apartments are using Freddie Mac and Fannie loans, financing from insurance firms or are finding other workarounds such as assuming buyers\u2019 existing debt on a property or purchasing all cash. Property Reserve did not record a mortgage on the Del Ola purchase.\nThis month, AvalonBay Communities paid\n$98.3 million\nfor the 270-unit Avalon Coconut Creek apartment complex at 5401 Wiles Road in Coconut Creek, and Favo Capital purchased the 22-story, 277-unit 1818 Park apartment tower at 1818 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood for\n$190 million\n. AvalonBay didn\u2019t record a mortgage, and Favo completed the purchase though an all-stock and assumption of liabilities deal.\n",

        "content": "Developers Bart Przyjemski and Anita Lisek found a buyer willing to take on a rare conversion of a Chicago rental property to a for-sale condo building.\nNoah Properties, the Chicago-based development team founded by the husband-and-wife duo, sold The Avondale, a 52-unit townhome property at 4200 West Belmont Avenue, for $34 million to an out-of-state buyer, according to the Kiser Group brokerage.\nTransforming the property, known as The Avondale, into for-sale units would mark a turn in the Chicago condo market, as a streak of big deals for buildings that went the other way \u2014 from condos into rentals \u2014 took hold of the city in the late 2010s and into the early 2020s. Those transactions, known as condo deconversions that put separately owned homes in a building under the ownership of one landlord, have slowed down, though.\nIf the buyer, who hasn\u2019t yet been identified in public records, pulls off a conversion of The Avondale into condos, it would mark the second project taking the route in Chicago. Developer Crescent Heights began marketing units in\n850 North Lake Shore Drive\nfor sale as condos after buying that former rental building last year for $80 million, a substantial discount from its previous value.\n\nNoah is moving on from the property after taking out a $26.5 million construction loan to build it in 2021 and testing the market for the property a year later after it was completed. However, it never sold, as the developer opted to refinance it instead with a $26 million loan from Ready Capital, and an appraised value of $35 million, public loan data said.\n\u201cThey were originally intended to be for-sale condos, and the market wasn\u2019t there for them in 2022, when it was still the tail-end of the pandemic, and Noah filled it up with renters,\u201d said Kiser Group\u2019s Andy Friedman, who represented the buyer in the Avondale deal. Jake Parker of the Kiser Group represented Noah.\nThe Avondale features large units, with 32 three-bedroom layouts spanning more than 2,200 square feet each, 16 four-bedroom at more than 2,500 square feet, and four five-bedroom units of 4,000 square feet.\nWhile Noah appears to have cleared the Ready Capital debt with some room to spare on the sale, the developer still dealt with some financial pain due to a floating interest rate. Noah was likely putting in cash out of pocket to cover some debt service, after the interest rate hikes of 2023 ratcheted up the costs of floating deals, according to loan data collated by Morningstar Credit.\nThe loan data shows The Avondale generated nearly $2.3 million in revenue last year at 94 percent leased, but after over $800,000 in operating expenses and $2.4 million in debt service costs, there wasn\u2019t takehome pay for Noah until the sale.",

        "content": "For decades, the New York City Housing Authority tried to keep up its buildings without help from the private sector. It was like using paper cups to bail out the Titanic.\nEven when NYCHA started\nenlisting developers\nto fix properties early in the de Blasio administration and ramped up those efforts under Mayor Eric Adams, it couldn\u2019t make progress fast enough.\nThe numbers are mind-boggling. In 2011, NYCHA developments needed $29.2 billion worth of work. By 2017, the number had ballooned to $45.3 billion. Its latest physical needs assessment, in 2023, came to a stunning $78.3 billion, or $445,000 per apartment.\nOne reason for the increase was inflation, but most of it was the accelerating deterioration of old buildings. So the agency turned to the private sector to increase its capacity.\n\u201cThe faster we work, the quicker we can stay ahead of this,\u201d NYCHA chairman Jamie Rubin said in an interview.\nNow the nation\u2019s largest public housing system is opening a new line of business with real estate firms. It spelled out the effort Tuesday in a rather extraordinary request for proposals.\nNYCHA is looking to make deals with private parties that control a development site near the city\u2019s most decrepit public housing. One scenario might be:\nThe developer puts up a mixed-income or fully affordable building on the private site\nTenants move there from the nearby public housing\nThe developer gut-renovates \u2014 or demolishes and rebuilds \u2014 the vacated NYCHA building\nThe tenants move back to the new or renovated NYCHA building\nThe developer manages the new public housing\nThe private sector\u2019s incentives would include development fees, reliable Section 8 rental income and management fees for operating the properties.\nThere\u2019s another carrot: By working with NYCHA, developers could also build affordable housing much faster than by going through the city\u2019s Department of Housing Preservation and Development.\nHPD has a backlog of projects. A developer needing subsidies from the agency must often wait several years (although less than a year for certain projects). NYCHA is offering an immediate start, a different set of tools, help with the development plan and maybe even some capital.\n\nThe new\nrequest for expressions of interest\nwasn\u2019t hatched out of thin air. NYCHA spoke with some big developers about what would make sense for them and for the public housing system, which is by far the nation\u2019s largest. It crafted a flexible RFEI so private interests could offer a variety of approaches.\n\u201cI am confident we will get a lot of good ideas,\u201d Rubin said.\nOpposition\nis also likely. Critics tend to crop up when NYCHA works with for-profit developers, such as L+M Development Partners and Related Companies. They bemoan \u201cprivatization,\u201d although only property management and not ownership is privatized.\nMany tenants just don\u2019t trust the agency, which is understandable given its history. But that\u2019s actually an argument for getting help from the private sector, because the alternative is NYCHA going it alone.\nProtests have diminished since the initial years of the partnership program, called\nPACT\n/RAD, because tenants like their renovated campuses. But opposition continues at the West Chelsea development, where NYCHA will knock down a building that is no longer worth fixing and has enlisted Related to\nbuild 217 units\n.\nA\nbuild-and-demolish plan\nat the same Fulton Houses was scuttled during the de Blasio years because of blowback, only for the property to deteriorate further. People are fighting the new plan, too. Some opponents don\u2019t even live in public housing. They just don\u2019t want construction disrupting their lives.\nLocal opposition is just one threat to NYCHA\u2019s new strategy. Another is Zohran Mamdani, who may be mayor when the time comes to make deals with RFEI respondents. The deadline for submissions is Nov. 18, two weeks after the mayoral election.\nIf the socialist Assembly member wins, all bets may be off. His housing plan makes no mention of tapping the private sector. Quite the opposite.\n\u201cWhen the City allows private developers to build,\u201d\nMamdani\u2019s housing plan\nwarns, \u201cwe are inviting the private sector to profit.\u201d\nThat is precisely what NYCHA is doing. Profit is the backbone of its plan: Developers get the chance to make money in exchange for doing work that NYCHA has been unable to do on its own.\n",

        "content": "Gregory C. O\u2019Connell Jr., a progressive developer who was responsible for much of the revitalization of Brooklyn\u2019s Red Hook neighborhood, died on August 2 at his home in Geneseo, New York. He was 83.\nThe cause of death was pancreatic cancer, his son Gregory T. O\u2019Connell told\nThe New York Times.\nBorn in Queens in 1942, O\u2019Connell was the son of a police officer and a teacher. He made his first real estate venture when he was a student at the State University of New York (SUNY) Geneseo, investing $22,000 along with two friends to buy and renovate a building they then rented out to fellow students.\nAfter graduating in 1964 with a teaching degree, O\u2019Connell joined the New York City Police Department and later became a detective. He bought his first property in the city in 1967, paying $28,500 for a Cobble Hill house that he renovated himself. He continued to acquire other properties throughout the 1970s in Carroll Gardens and the Columbia Street waterfront district. He eventually retired from the force in 1981 to become a developer full-time.\nHe bought his first property in Red Hook, then a gritty and industrial enclave, a year after retiring from the NYPD. In 1992, he purchased 28 acres along the waterfront for $500,000 and set about redeveloping the area with an eye for commercial and light manufacturing.\n\u201cI could make three times the amount of profit with residential than I\u2019m doing with commercial and industrial,\u201d he told the\nCommercial Observer\nin 2008. \u201cAnd I could get the zoning changes, but for me the key is balance, so you take a little less, and everybody gets a piece of the pie.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Connell\u2019s work in Red Hook is credited with\nrevitalizing\nthe area. At one point, he was said to own\n$400 million\nworth of property in the neighborhood.\nHe was especially known for bringing a\nFairway Supermarket\nto a Civil War-era warehouse in the district, providing the neighborhood with jobs and affordable food. In the course of that project, O\u2019Connell exposed a local council member, Angel Rodriguez, for soliciting a bribe in exchange for support on the project.\nWhen Hurricane Sandy\nrocked the area\n, causing an estimated $50 million in damages, O\u2019Connell provided rent abatements and low-interest loans to his tenants as they got back on their feet.\nBrooklyn business owners, real estate developers, and community members expressed condolences after O\u2019Connell\u2019s passing. On LinkedIn, Brooklyn tour guide Dom Gervasi called him \u201ca man of vision \u2013 [whose] vision actually materialized.\u201d He added, \u201cI admire Greg O\u2019Connell Sr. not only for standing apart from so many others in his industry as a force for good, but for his humanity.\u201d\nO\u2019Connell is survived by his wife, two sons, four grandchildren, and two brothers.\nThe younger Greg O\u2019Connell posted on LinkedIn to pay tribute to his father.\n\u201cHe believed in me. He believed in us all.\u201d",

        "content": "Billionaire Russell Weiner is expanding his Miami Beach real estate portfolio with the $35.3 million purchase of a waterfront mansion on Star Island,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nWeiner closed on the purchase of the 1.1-acre property at 43 Star Island Drive on Thursday, according to sources. The late Dr. David Frankel, a prominent dermatologist, owned the 11,104-square foot, eight-bedroom mansion with his wife, Linda Frankel. It previously belonged to former talk show host and comedian Rosie O\u2019Donnell.\nThe price is closer to $36 million, including commissions, according to a source.\nThe home, built in 1923, was listed with Compass agent Liz Hogan for $48 million. Weiner, who confirmed he bought the property, received a 26 percent discount off the asking price. It went into contract\nin mid-June\n, according to the Multiple Listing Service. Hogan, who brokered both sides of the deal, could not be reached for comment.\nHomeowners on Star Island include Gloria and Emilio Estefan, billionaires Ken Griffin and Philip and Patricia Frost, Rick Ross and Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, who is in jail. Earlier this year, billionaire developer Vlad Doronin sold his waterfront Star Island estate\nfor $120 million\n, setting a new record for home sales in Miami-Dade County.\nWeiner, who made his fortune with the $3.9 billion sale of Rockstar Energy to PepsiCo in 2020, has set his sights on ultra-luxury residential real estate in South Florida.\nHe\u2019s building a massive compound on Pine Tree Drive and is also the true owner of\n5300 North Bay Road\n. Both properties are in Miami Beach. Developer and hospitality mogul Keith Menin paid $16.1 million for the waterfront North Bay Road home last year and has been renovating the property into the Mediterranean-modern style his company, Menin Homes, uses.\n\nWeiner is working with Menin on the North Bay Road project and a planned expansion and renovation of the Star Island property, he confirmed. The North Bay Road home will likely be completed in September and could hit the market for $35 million, according to a source.\nThe Star Island estate has 200 feet of water frontage, two guest houses, a boat house and tropical landscaping, according to the listing. The expanded estate could span 15,000 square feet once completed, with a master suite, gym, spa, padel court and cabana.\nIt will likely hit the market for more than $100 million, the source said.\nWeiner has been buying and selling homes in South Florida for years. In 2020, he flipped two homes in North Palm Beach for more than $48 million, reaping a 45 percent gain in one month. The billionaire entrepreneur bought the properties from Swedish model Elin Nordegren, the ex-wife of golfer Tiger Woods, for\nnearly $33 million\na month earlier.\nConstruction of his Pine Tree Drive estate is at the\ncenter of lawsuits\ninvolving Weiner and his former project manager. Earlier this year, he foreclosed on the middle property at 5101 Pine Tree Drive\nvia foreclosure\n.\nMenin is a principal at Miami-based Menin Hospitality and owner of Bodega Taqueria and Tequila. His Menin Homes has bought, renovated and sold other homes in South Florida. The company was recently involved in the renovation of attorney Anthony Lopez and former \u201cReal Housewife of Miami,\u201d Dr. Nicole Martin\u2019s waterfront Coral Gables estate, which\nsold for $40 million\n.\n",

        "content": "A Pacific Palisades property once owned by the late actor and comedian Dom DeLuise hit the market Thursday with an asking price more than triple what it last sold for.\nAnthony Marguleas\n, founder of Palisades-based Amalfi Estates, is marketing 1186 Corsica Drive, which is asking $21 million.\nThe broker also represented the buyer when DeLuise\u2019s estate sold the home for $6.5 million in 2021 to an entity managed by Jeff Mironer, according to property records.\nMironer runs developer Provincetown Estates, which specializes in residential projects in the Palisades, and is behind the rebuild of the former DeLuise property.\nDeLuise appeared in several Mel Brooks films, such as \u201cThe Twelve Chairs,\u201d \u201cBlazing Saddles\u201d and \u201cSilent Movie.\u201d There was also \u201cFatso,\u201d which Brooks\u2019 wife Anne Bancroft directed. The actor also authored several cookbooks and children\u2019s books, in addition to lending his voice in \u201cAn American Tail\u201d and \u201cAll Dogs Go to Heaven.\u201d\nThe new build spans over 10,000 square feet and has six bedrooms, seven full bathrooms, two powder rooms, a three-car garage and elevator.\n\nThe property sits less than half a mile away from the Riviera Country Club and is also about a five-minute drive to the Brentwood Country Mart.\nThe home\u2019s landscaping is inspired by the Mediterranean, with olive trees and gardens, in addition to an outdoor kitchen with a pizza oven. Inside, the home touts white oak floors, custom wood moldings and millwork, a speakeasy bar, 1,657-bottle wine room and theater. A whole wing of the residence is dedicated to wellness, with a gym, sauna, cold plunge and massage room.\nIt\u2019s a big change from the ranch-style home that DeLuise\nreportedly\npaid $103,000 for in 1968. That price adjusted for inflation would still be under $1 million today, for a 4,500 square feet with five beds and fourth baths, built in 1953, according to the home\u2019s previous listing.\nAs the Palisades bounces back from the fires, it\u2019s seeing land listings continue to hit the market. However, as noted in Marguleas\u2019 July market report recapping June, the gap between the number of new listings and closings is shrinking.\nMarguleas said he expects land listings to peak at about 500 by the middle of next year, based on how the market is currently faring with over 75 properties added to the market each month.\nIn June, 77 land listings hit the market, compared to 39 sold, according to Marguleas\u2019 report. That could be viewed as an improvement compared to March\u2019s 115 land listings and 11 closings, or April\u2019s 112 listings and 26 sales.\n",

Jannone will now move to return to its original plan.\nJannone looks to complete the apartment-to-condo conversion and sales process over the next 18 to 24 months, per Business First. In locking down the financing, the developer is \u201cperfectly positioned to meet the growing demand for ownership opportunities\u201d in\nKoreatown\n, according to JLL\u2019s Chris Collins, who represented the borrower.\nKoreatown is quickly becoming a go-to destination for property buyers in Los Angeles.\n\nThe ZIP code 90020 in the L.A. enclave was the hottest housing market in the city in the second quarter,\naccording\nto Business First. The average sale price was $2.2 million with 62 new listings hitting the market last quarter. Another Koreatown ZIP code, 90004, rounded out the top five hottest markets in Greater L.A. alongside parts of Newport Beach and Silverado.\nElsewhere in Koreatown, other use conversions and multifamily redevelopment projects have moved forward in recent months.\nLast month, Jamison Properties filed plans to convert a 20-story office building at\n3550 Wilshire Boulevard\ninto 495 apartments. That project follows Jamison\u2019s similar adaptive reuse endeavors at\n3325 Wilshire\nand a two-tower high-rise complex at\n3600 Wilshire\n. In 2023, the developer filed plans to convert a 17-story office tower at\n6380 Wilshire\ninto 210 apartments.\nIn June, Barkley Development\nfiled an application\nto turn 412 South Catalina Street into a six-story, 53-unit apartment building with a 22-car garage. That project would be an extension of a similar redevelopment next door at 400 South Catalina Street completed in 2019, which turned two smaller apartment buildings into a 61-unit property with a gym, roof deck and subterranean parking.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "Victor Ciardelli, the mortgage mogul behind Rate, has sold his Hinsdale home at a markdown.\nThe five-bedroom, six-bath property at 622 South Washington Street in Hinsdale closed Wednesday for $2.45 million. Ciardelli and his wife, Sandra, listed the home in April at just under $2.8 million before trimming the ask to $2.58 million, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The deal closed at about 87 percent of the original asking price.\nAccording to the listing provided by the sellers\u2019 agents \u2014 Coldwell Banker\u2019s Stefania Campo and Paula Ciardelli, Victor\u2019s ex-wife \u2014 the home was built in 1907 and sits on an 8,520-square-foot lot, but the home\u2019s square footage was not disclosed. The buyers, not yet identified in public filings, were represented by Jennifer Williams of Coldwell Banker.\nCiardelli bought the house in 2013 for roughly $1.64 million. Photos from the listing show a Hamptons-style exterior, airy white interiors, and traditional finishes like wainscoting and multi-paneled windows. Perks include a balcony off the primary bedroom, a basement pub and a sauna.\n\nThe sale is a relatively small-ticket move for Ciardelli, who in 2021 dropped $37.5 million on a Miami Beach\nestate\nin the Altos Del Mar enclave. His Chicago-area house hunt has been overshadowed by\nRate\u2019s\nown turbulence. Founded in 2000 with $2.5 million from family and friends, the firm ballooned to more than 10,000 employees by 2021. But as mortgage volume shrank in the current environment, Rate reportedly cut staff by nearly half.\nLast year, Rate \u2014 the Chicago lender whose name is on the White Sox ballpark,\nRate Field\n\u2014 originated $26.4 billion in mortgages, good for sixth place nationally, according to Scotsman Guide. But the lender has been dogged by internal scrutiny: a June 2024 Chicago Tribune investigation described a\ntoxic culture\nunder Ciardelli, alleging he frequently berated employees. Ciardelli denied the claims.\nThe Hinsdale sale looks more like housekeeping than distress for the Rate CEO. With his Miami mansion already secured, Ciardelli is clearly shifting his personal footprint south. But unloading a suburban house at a discount underscores the reality of today\u2019s market, where sellers rarely get everything they ask for.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Brookfield Properties is working to meet housing demand in the Bay Area with a change of plans in San Mateo.\nThe New York-based developer has revised its redevelopment plan for Concar Passage, a new mixed-use community at the Concar Shopping Center. The new version would cut down on retail in favor of housing, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. The strip mall currently is home to businesses like Trader Joe\u2019s, T.J. Maxx and 7-Eleven.\nThe new plan calls for 847 homes consisting of a mix of rental apartments and for-sale townhomes. About 186 apartments will be set aside for affordable housing.\nIt\u2019s a shave from a previous proposal approved in 2020 that had called for 961 apartments at the site, including 73 affordable units. That plan also included the construction of a food hall and a daycare facility. The new plan would \u201cbring much-needed new housing, open space and neighborhood-serving retail\u201d to the area, Josh Roden, president of Brookfield Residential NorCal, told the Chronicle.\nBrookfield plans to demolish a chunk of the shopping center\u2019s commercial space, forcing Ross Dress for Less, T.J. Maxx and The Pantry restaurant to close or move.\n\nThe\nConcar Passage\nsite is just one several retail spaces across the Bay Area that developers have floated for redevelopment.\nIn San Francisco, for example, Brookfield is moving forward with 3,500 new residential units on 30 acres of parking lot space at the highly trafficked Stonestown Galleria mall. About 20 percent of that housing will be below market rate.\nAcross the Golden Gate Bridge in Marin County, Prado Group is looking at turning a closed Macy\u2019s store and its accompanying parking lot for potential development into housing. Last year, the city of San Rafael approved Merlone Geier Partners\u2019 plan to build about 1,400 units at the Northgate Mall.\nIf Brookfield\u2019s Concar Passage project is approved by the end of next year, construction is expected to begin in 2027 and wrap up in 2032. Under its\nHousing Element\n, San Mateo must plan for 7,015 new residential units by 2031.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Hines smashed another Houston real estate record, this time with a splashy retail-and-office buy in Montrose.\nThe global developer\u2019s nontraded Real Estate Investment Trust, Hines Global Income Trust, paid $137.6 million for Montrose Collective, a 189,000-square-foot mixed-use project at 888 Westheimer Road, according to an SEC filing Bisnow\nreported\n. The deal pencils out to about $728 per square foot \u2014 more than triple the metro\u2019s average retail price per square foot of $223 last quarter.\nThe project, developed by Radom Capital, was completed in 2023 after a pandemic-delayed build that mixed new construction with adaptive reuse across 2.4 acres. It includes about 100,000 square feet of offices leased to tenants such as Live Nation and renewable energy firm Pattern Energy, plus 50,000 square feet of retail anchored by restaurants, boutiques and fitness brands like Uchi and Solidcore. The development also houses the Freed-Montrose branch of the Houston Public Library, part of a land-swap deal with the city.\nThe property is fully leased, according to Hines\u2019 SEC disclosure. The buy resets the city\u2019s price-per-foot high-water mark, a record Hines itself set last year with its $145 million purchase of\n200 Park Place\n, an office tower that traded for about $700 per square foot. The Montrose Collective trade also arrives as Houston retail investment volume climbs from a subdued 2023.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the only eye-popping retail deal this summer. Brixmor Property Group, a New York firm, dropped $233 million for\nLaCenterra at Cinco Ranch in Katy\n, a 409,000-square-foot lifestyle center. That deal worked out to $545 per square foot, more than double the metro average.\nInvestors and developers have been watching closely for what Montrose Collective would fetch, given its high-profile tenants and prime urban location. For the Hines REIT, which has been busy scooping up trophy\nassets\nin its home market, the Montrose deal underscores a willingness to pay top dollar for curated, experience-driven real estate.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The site, between Lincoln Park and Bucktown, would include nearly 3,300 residential units, 350,000 square feet of office, 435,000 square feet of retail, 250,000 square feet of hotel space and 12 acres of open space.\nRenderings depict Southport Avenue as the spine of the project, lined with mid- and high-rise buildings up to 38 stories, while townhomes and single-family houses hug an extended riverwalk. JDL is working with local architecture firm HPA on the site\u2019s master plan, Chicago YIMBY\nreported\n.\nBut the city\u2019s Department of Planning &amp; Development has already raised concerns. In a recent response letter, officials suggested replacing riverfront for-sale homes with multifamily, to avoid clashes between private owners and public riverwalk users. They also pressed the developers on phasing, interim uses and traffic fixes.\n\nInfrastructure is the perennial sticking point. Sterling Bay, the project\u2019s original developer, won Chicago City Council approval in 2019 with a controversial agreement that the developer would bankroll new bridges and roads upfront, but would later be reimbursed by the city with as much as $490 million in tax incentive fund dollars as projects were completed. Whether Foundry Park requires the same level of investment remains to be seen, though the Chicago Department of Transportation flagged future connections to the 606 trail, a Southport-Throop bridge and a redesign of the messy Elston-Ashland-Armitage intersection as factors to consider.\nFor now, JDL CEO Jim Letchinger told the outlet that the\nproposal\nwas \u201cindicative of what we are attempting to do,\u201d while cautioning that details could shift as the city reviews the plan. What\u2019s clear is that the tract \u2014 once home to the A. Finkl &amp; Sons steel mill and most recently in the hands of\nBankOZK\nafter it foreclosed on Sterling Bay \u2014 is finally back in play.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

UCSF bought the 50,000-square-foot parcel where the eight-story center will be built from Associate Capital this spring for $75 million.\nIn total, the center could cost nearly half a billion dollars. The developer estimates construction costs around $400 million, according to the Business Times. In May, the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank\napproved the issuance\nof up to $575 million in tax-exempt, fixed-rate revenue bonds to fund the cancer center.\nThe proton therapy center will be built in the building\u2019s basement.

When completed, it will be one of fewer than 50 such centers in the United States today.

        "content": "A 21-story vacant office building in the Garment District was a prime candidate for a residential conversion, after a key upzoning in Manhattan.\nThe listing for Expansion Group\u2019s 554-568 Eighth Avenue boasted that the more than 300,000-square-foot building was ready to be converted into residential space, potentially with the use of a new property tax break available for office-to-residential conversions.\nBut the property was among the sites the City Council carved out of the northwest section of the Midtown South rezoning.\nInstead of allowing residential space with a floor area ratio, or FAR, of up to 18, the Council decided to increase the permitted density for light-industrial use and to eliminate residential as an option for 37 properties within the Garment District.\nBy the city\u2019s count, only 76 apartments were shaved off the rezoning\u2019s housing projections as a result of that change. Another projected 117 units were eliminated when the City Council reduced the maximum residential FAR from 18 to 15 in the southeast quadrant of the rezoning.\nBut the Garment District Alliance, a business improvement district whose board members include local property owners,\u00a0say that far more housing was at stake. A report commissioned by the Garment District Alliance and produced by BFJ Planning concluded that six sites included in the northwest carveout could have contributed between 900 and 1,000 units of housing if the City Council left the rezoning intact.\nInstead, 37 property owners were \u201cblindsided.\u201d\n\u201cWe had to basically announce it to those 37 property owners, many of whom are really ticked off for obvious reasons,\u201d said Barbara Blair, president of the Garment District Alliance. \u201cSome of them had sort of started down the road of thinking about converting to housing and had plans that were in the works.\u201d\nProperties like the Eighth Avenue building, and others identified by BFJ, underscore how housing projections for zoning changes are an approximation, an art rather than exact science. City Planning has its own criteria for determining the likelihood that a site will be developed, but such estimates can\u2019t anticipate whims of the market or of developers, nor fully account for every possible development scenario. Neither can BFJ\u2019s report.\nThe agency labeled 61 properties as \u201cprojected development sites\u201d and estimated that 9,676 apartments would be built across those sites over the next 10 years if the rezoning were approved. Those calculations did not include properties like Expansion Group\u2019s Eighth Avenue building, which was not identified by City Planning as a likely redevelopment site as part of the rezoning.\nWhen asked about BFJ\u2019s report, a City Planning spokesperson pointed to its methodology.\n\u201cThe Dept of City Planning\u2019s environmental review for the Midtown South Mixed-Use Plan (as proposed and modified) adheres to the extremely detailed standards and methodology of City Environmental Quality Review,\u201d a City Planning spokesperson said. \u201cOur work is based on hard data and documented in detail in our environmental impact statement and technical memo. The claims presented in their memo are not supported by facts or any known methodology.\u201d\nThe spokesperson noted that the BFJ projections include density bonuses that would require additional approvals, while city projections rely on development that can happen as-of-right. The report also doesn\u2019t go into detail about how potential development sites were selected or aspects of its methodology.\nEven with the\nchanges\nthat reduced residential density, the rezoning is a major milestone for the city. The rezoning,\napproved\nlast week by the City Council, marks the first time that the city has mapped new districts that allow residential FARs of 15 and 18. These higher density districts were made possible by changes made in the state budget last year and in the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity text amendment.\n\nStill, the reasons given for the carveouts are controversial. Local Council member Erik Bottcher indicated last week that the modifications were aimed at assuaging concerns that fashion-related businesses in Garment District would be driven out by landlords eager to redevelop their buildings. The carveout for this area will help ensure that \u201cnew housing and new business growth can thrive side-by-side,\u201d Bottcher said.\nThe rezoning area is home to nearly a quarter of New York City\u2019s fashion manufacturing and wholesale jobs. That is equal to about 2,300 jobs, representing less than 2 percent of the area\u2019s total jobs and an 80 percent decline in the sector over the previous two decades, according to City Planning. Some have questioned the wisdom of trying to plan around these garment-focused businesses, given this decline.\n\u201cThis area has long since ceased to include any meaningful manufacturing activity, let alone garment factories or assembly,\u201d Herrick\u2019s Mitch Korbey said in a statement last week.\nBlair called the carveout a \u201cvast overreach.\u201d\n\u201cThe modifications that were made were made at the 11th hour,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were not aware of them at all. It was a done deal by the time we learned about it.\u201d\nShe believes that if the BID had been included in the modification negotiations, it could have helped \u201cright-size any kind of exclusion.\u201d\nShe noted that those owners will also see building values in the surrounding area increase but won\u2019t be able to enjoy the same appreciation because their properties\u2019 use is limited.\nThe owners of some of those properties, meanwhile, are leaning into the existing office use. A\nlisting\nfor 262 West 38th Street boasts that the property is nearly fully occupied with \u201ca vibrant mix of fashion, technology, nonprofit, architecture, engineering, and other industry tenants.\u201d\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the landlord is happy with the rezoning changes. Owner Silver Eight Capital\u2019s Guillermo Silberman said that his company was unlikely to directly take advantage of a residential conversion but believed the building still would have benefited. Allowing residential use in the area could have culled unused office space for the market and led to a \u201cmore vibrant, mixed-use neighborhood,\u201d he said. The properties neighboring his building are vacant or nearly so, and now they don\u2019t have the option to convert to another use.\n\u201cTo be clear, there is insufficient demand for manufacturing and office space, so the opposition to the rezoning on these blocks did not make much sense to me,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cIf they wanted or needed the space, they\u2019d be occupying these properties.\u201d\nJLL\u2019s Drew Isaacson and Hall Oster, who are marketing 554-568 Eighth Avenue, still have a bright outlook for the rezoning. (They declined to speak specifically about the Eighth Avenue property, and representatives for Expansion Group didn\u2019t return messages seeking comment.)\nThe brokers said even with the rezoning carveouts, commercial buildings will benefit from demand for office space in the area, especially as other properties convert to residential.\n\u201cThis is an area that should be far more vibrant than it is for all asset classes,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cIt\u2019s square in the center of Manhattan.\u201d\n",

        "content": "\ud83c\udfc6 Residential:\nA pre-war triplex in Lenox Hill marked the top residential deal recorded in the Big Apple.\nLois Chiles\n, a model and actress who starred opposite Roger Moore in the 1979 installment in the James Bond franchise, \u201cMoonraker,\u201d sold the three-level co-op at\n953 Fifth Avenue\nfor $12 million to a trust tied to\nJacqueline McCoy.\nThe three-bedroom co-op has a private elevator landing, wood-burning fireplace and terrace. The unit first went on the market in March 2024 with an asking price of $18 million. Compass\u2019\nLib Goss, Julie Wurts\nand\nJames Hall\nrepresented Chiles.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded in New York was the closing of Miki Naftali\u2019s acquisition of\n800 Fifth Avenue\nfor $810 million. The sellers were\nEliot Spitzer\nand the\nWinter Organization\n. The 33-story rental building has 208 units, and\nJPMorgan\nprovided a $675 million loan for the purchase. Naftali, whose partners include high-net-worth families from Mexico, Japan and Israel, plans to tear down the tower and replace it with a new one.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nNew York Police Department commissioner and billionaire heiress\nJessica Tisch\noffloaded a four-bedroom co-op at\n9 East 79th Street\non the Upper East Side for $10.5 million. The buyer was\nJohn Berger.\nThe duplex measures about 4,000 square feet, pricing the deal at more than $2,600 per square foot. The unit first went on the market last year for $13 million. Corcoran\u2019s\nDeborah Grubman, David Adler\nand\nPaul Albano\nhad the listing.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nOn the Upper West Side,\nCathleen Price Seaman\nscooped up a nearly 2,900-square-foot, three-bedroom unit at The Apthorp at\n390 West End Avenue\nfor $5.4 million. The seller,\nDown York Enterprises Ltd.\n, paid just under $4 million for the pad in 2010. The latest transaction works out to about $1,900 per square foot. The latest asking price was just under $5.7 million. Douglas Elliman\u2019s\nJamie Safier\nand\nKim Shepard\nhad the listing.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nA Park Slope brownstone traded for $5.5 million. The sellers of the two-family home at\n461 11th Street\nwere\nAvishy and Laura Fisher\n, and the buyers were attorneys\nKevin Trowel\nand\nSidney Bashago.\nThe Fishers paid just under $3 million for the townhouse in 2021. The latest transaction appears to have been an off-market purchase.\nBy the Numbers:\nThese Hamptons firms dominate with fewer, but pricer, home sales\n\nFor some Hamptons brokerages, it\u2019s about value \u2014 not volume.\nAmong the brokerages with the\ngreatest residential sales volume\nin the Hamptons, three firms handled the fewest deals that were, on average, the priciest.\nBespoke Real Estate closed 48 sales in the Hamptons over the past year, but the average price of those deals came in at about $11.2 million. That\u2019s the highest average prices among the top 10 real estate firms, by deal volume, on The Real Deal\u2019s\nannual ranking\nof Hamptons brokerages.\nCorrection:\nThe top commercial real estate transaction in yesterday\u2019s newsletter inaccurately described the nature of the deal. Here are the corrected details:\nThe top commercial real estate transaction recorded in the Big Apple was for a five-story office building in Soho.\n7G Group,\nled by Jon Krasner,\nlast year purchased a defaulted note on a 17,000-square-foot property at\n123 Lafayette Street\nthen filed a foreclosure action. The company reached an agreement with the building\u2019s owner, an affiliate of\nFirst Atlantic Capital\n, to transfer the property\u2019s deed to 7G. The foreclosure settlement was $21.8 million. The First Atlantic entity bought the site in 2016 for $33.5 million with a $16 million mortgage from Signature Bank.\nHarvey I.

        "content": "Of all the criticisms leveled against Zohran Mamdani, his occupancy of a\nrent-stabilized apartment\nis probably the weakest.\nThat\u2019s because he is essentially paying market-rate rent,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nFor his unit at 32-15 35th Street in Astoria, the socialist mayoral candidate pays what is called a preferential rent, meaning a lower amount than the landlord could charge under state law.\nThat might look like a sweetheart deal: Mamdani pays about $2,250 a month, while the legal rent \u2014 the maximum allowed under rent stabilization \u2014 is nearly $3,100 for his one-bedroom apartment.\nBut the 30 free-market units in the 52-unit building have an average rent of $2,115, according to the owner\u2019s property tax assessment challenge. That is even less than Mamdani is paying, which is an indication that the owner could not get the legal rent of $3,082 if he or she tried.\nThat is usually the case with preferential rents, although they are also offered when a landlord wants to give a particular tenant a break.\nWhy didn\u2019t Mamdani bring this up when rival candidate Andrew Cuomo\nattacked him\nfor leasing a rent-stabilized apartment? That is unclear. Mamdani might not have known he was paying a preferential rent until\nTRD\nemailed his campaign an inquiry, which went unanswered Thursday. He has said he did not know the unit was rent-stabilized when he rented it.\nIt is likely, however, that Mamdani\u2019s unit would be rented out for closer to the $3,082 maximum if he were to win the November election and move to Gracie Mansion. Despite a pandemic dip, rent growth has been strong since the pre-Covid period when Mamdani initially rented the apartment. Astoria specifically has seen the steepest rent growth in Queens, with the average price of a one-bedroom hitting $3,304 this year, compared to $2,845 a year ago, per a report from M.N.S. Real Estate. But the Rent Guidelines Board has kept rent increases\nbelow the inflation rate\nfor a decade.\nAt one time, Mamdani\u2019s landlord could have jacked up his rent to the legal limit, but in June 2019, the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act gave\nadditional protection\nto tenants paying preferential rent. The landlord would have to wait for Mamdani to leave to raise the rent to the legal limit.\nBut even then, there is no guarantee that someone would pay it. StreetEasy on Wednesday showed 86 listings for one-bedrooms in Astoria asking less than $3,000 a month.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nProperty tax arrears are public information. Should outstanding mortgage debt be public as well? With easy access to property debt, people who\nbought Hamptons houses in foreclosure\nfrom Michael O\u2019Sullivan, only to lose them to lenders or foreclosure auction bidders, might have avoided that disaster.\nOn the other hand, such clueless people might have failed to check the debt anyway. And making mortgage balances public could be considered an invasion of privacy and have unintended consequences. Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\n\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The New York State Bar Association is working on a report about housing court. It will become public after it\u2019s adopted by the group\u2019s House of Delegates. Given housing court\u2019s reputation for dysfunction and delay, and the endless horror stories told by landlords and their lawyers, the bar association\u2019s report could present a damning picture.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 An appellate judge has upheld an order blocking the Department of Social Services from ending a key housing voucher program, according to a press release from supportive shelter and housing provider Win. The ruling preserves the \u201cunit hold incentive,\u201d which compensates landlords who accept CityFHEPS tenants while holding a unit vacant during the voucher holder\u2019s application process.\n\u2014 This month\u2019s Legionnaires\u2019 disease outbreak in Central Harlem, which has killed five people, hospitalized 14 and made sickened 100 New Yorkers in all, comes after the city\u2019s Department of Health lost over one-third of its cooling tower inspectors in the past three years,\nGothamist\nfound. Though the city aims to inspect towers annually, seven out of the 10 linked to the current outbreak were not inspected in the past year.\n\u2014 Mayor Eric Adams and Council Speaker Adrienne Adams will roll out a pilot this fall to streamline the city\u2019s discretionary funding process for some nonprofits,\nCity &amp; State\nreported. The initiative replaces the current months-long contracting process with direct one-year grant agreements, cutting out 13 steps. About 100 organizations will test the new system in the first year.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$15 million\nfor a 3,466-square-foot resale condominium unit at 157 West 57th Street. Bespoke Real Estate had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$19.8 million\nfor a portfolio of mixed-use properties at 194-196 Avenue A and 503-505 East 12th Street in the East Village. The four properties have a total of 16,336 square feet and 15 residential units. Avenue Realty Capital sold the properties to Hamilton Lane.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$7.4 million\nfor a 4,800-square-foot co-op at 477 Washington Street in Hudson Square. Thomas Hemann with Compass has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for a proposed 68,458-square-foot, 13-story mixed-use building at 2361 Second Avenue in East Harlem. Panagis Georgopoulos filed the permit on behalf of developer Abraham Biller.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "David Werner didn\u2019t hesitate when a deal came his way in Hudson Yards.\nThe real estate investor snapped up 440 Ninth Avenue in the trendy neighborhood for slightly more than $100 million in cash, Bloomberg\nreported\n. The deal for the office building, located between 34th and 35th Streets, breaks down to $243 per square foot.\nIt\u2019s likely a tough pill to swallow for the sellers, Taconic Investment Partners and Nuveen Real Estate, which purchased the property only seven years ago\nfor $269 million\n. The transaction was a short sale, meaning the purchase price was below the outstanding mortgage balance; lender MetLife agreed to the sale.\nCBRE\u2019s Doug Middleton and Jack Stillwagon arranged the sale. Nuveen and MetLife declined to comment to the outlet, while the other parties didn\u2019t immediately respond to the publication\u2019s requests for comment.\nThe former Harding Building went up almost a century ago, spanning 411,000 square feet and rising 18 stories high. Tenants have included BlackRock and KKR.\nWerner has been on a buying spree across New York City\u2019s office market, diving into the office-to-residential conversion space.\n\nIn the spring, Madison Realty Capital provided Werner and Nathan Berman\u2019s Metro Loft with a\n$720 million loan\nto redevelop the former Pfizer headquarters property at 235 East East 42nd Street in Midtown East. The financing likely represented a record for both the lender and the type of project being supported.\nWerner\u2019s deal in Hudson Yards may not be the last for an office property in the neighborhood.\nTwo months ago, Related Companies and partner Oxford Properties\nbegan exploring a sale\nof a portion of 35 Hudson Yards, including office, retail, fitness and hotel condominiums completed directly before the pandemic. The components could come to a $600 million price tag, sources previously told Bloomberg.\nThen again, a discount is always possible.

        "content": "A Palm Beach condo association reached a settlement with a resident nearly a year into litigation regarding an allegedly unsanctioned air conditioning project and $15 million in unaccounted special assessment funds.\nCourt records show the Halcyon of Palm Beach Condominium Association settled the case brought by resident Dr. Michael Montanaro, a local orthodontist. Montanaro filed suit in October, alleging that the association had violated owners\u2019 right to vote on a $2.5 million air conditioning project. The complaint sought a court-appointed receiver to assume control of the association and its finances.\nEarlier this month, Palm Beach Circuit Court Judge Maxine Cheesman approved the appointment of a receiver. As part of the settlement, the association will instead hire a forensic auditor to determine how the $15 million was spent, according to Montanaro\u2019s attorney, Bill Pincus.\n\u201cHaving a receiver would be much worse for them than having an accountant, as a receiver is in control of the association,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, the association will have a forensic accountant, agreeable to us, look through these books and figure out what happened with this money.\u201d\nThe unaccounted $15 million was raised in two separate special assessments in 2021, one for $6 million and one for $9 million. A previous investigation into the funds described the association\u2019s accounting as in \u201cshambles,\u201d court records show.\n\n\u201cThe main issue was that the association was simply unable to account for all of the $15 million it spent. Its effort to show what happened to all of that money was insufficient,\u201d said David Glickman, another attorney for Montanaro.\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t necessarily evidence of nefarious activity,\u201d he said, but it \u201craises a lot of questions,\u201d given the amount of money involved.\nA spokesperson for the association said it expects to hire the auditor in early September.\nThe Halcyon is a 104-unit, two-building oceanfront condo at 3440 South Ocean Boulevard on the South End of\nPalm Beach\n. The six-story and seven-story buildings were built in 1980, the same year Montanaro bought his two-bedroom unit for $87,000, property records show. It is one of dozens of older condo buildings on the island navigating the state\u2019s new\ncondo safety laws\n. Among other recent condo lawsuits in the area, the\nowners of La Clara\nin\nWest Palm Beach\nfiled suit in February against developer Great Gulf, alleging misrepresentation and defective construction.\nAs part of the Halcyon settlement, the association also agreed to pay Montanaro\u2019s $250,000 in legal fees, and he is excused from special assessments related to paying his fees, as well as the association\u2019s legal fees connected with the case, Pincus confirmed. Other terms of the settlement include a vote on the air conditioning project, which was previously greenlit by the association without a vote by the owners.\n\u201cMy client is very glad,\u201d Pincus said. \u201cI think ecstatic is a proper word.\u201d",

        "content": "Developer Alejandro Chaberman advanced plans to build Blue Park, an eight-story condominium with 173 units in Hallandale Beach, one of several projects he has launched in the city.\nThe Hallandale Beach City Commission voted unanimously Tuesday to approve a site plan for Blue Park and rezone, on second reading, one of four parcels in the development site, two blocks west of\nGulfstream Park\nracetrack and casino.\nBlue Park is designed as two eight-story condo buildings connected by a parking garage with a swimming pool on top. The 173 condos would include 36 studios, 43 two-bedroom units, and 94 one-bedroom units.\nSpread throughout the development, and across all three types of condos, would be 28 units reserved as workforce housing for buyers who earn up to 140 percent of the area median income\n\nAventura-based Blue Park LLC owns the 1.5-acre development site at 216, 220 and 228 Southeast Eighth Street and 221 Southeast Ninth Street in\nHallandale Beach\n. Blue Park LLC, led by Jonathan Cohen, Bryan Cohen and Roberto Cohen, assembled the four-parcel site last year, acquiring it for a total of $5.4 million, according to state and county records.\nChaberman has the site under contract, documents show. He was identified as the developer of Blue Park in a June 17 letter of intent to Hallandale Beach\u2019s Planning and Zoning Division from Ari Sklar, the project\u2019s Hollywood-based architect. In the letter, Sklar also disclosed that Blue Park will be condos. Neither the architect nor the developer could be reached for comment.\nChaberman has been active in Hallandale Beach. On the block just north of the Blue Park site, Kadima Developers is developing an eight-story, 121-unit condominium called\nSeven Park\nat 218-220 Southeast Seventh Street. Chaberman and Joseph Melul are co-founders of Kadima.\nConstruction of Seven Park is scheduled to start in October, a spokesperson confirmed. Kadima assigned Fortune Development Sales to lead sales and marketing of units, with prices starting at $375,000. The ground floor of the mixed-use development will have a quartet of 4,500-square-foot retail spaces.Chaberman is also a co-founder of Grupo Eco, which developed\nAtlantic Village\n, a mixed-use property in Hallandale Beach with restaurants, retail stores, and office space. Atlantic Village is next to\nJeffrey Soffer\u2019s Big Easy Casino\n, and covers three blocks on the west side of Federal Highway between Northeast Sixth Street and Atlantic Shores Boulevard.",

        "content": "Grand Prairie is pulling thousands of acres into its city limits to make way for one of North Texas\u2019 largest new communities.\nThe city council this month approved annexing about 900 acres into Goodland, a 5,000-acre master-planned project from Dallas-based Provident Realty Advisors. Located south of Mansfield near the U.S. 287 and 360 Tollway, the development is envisioned as a small city of its own, with homes, retail, civic amenities and even a water tower branded with its name. Goodland already counts more than 700 homes, with 280 more underway by David Weekley Homes and Highland Homes. At full buildout, the city projects the community will house 50,000 people and generate $5 billion in taxable value, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nProvident\u2019s plans for the annexed acreage include higher-density residential, regional parks, trails, a church, an event venue and a coffee shop. The firm is also planning a 50-acre town center with civic buildings and a walkable urban core, expandable if demand warrants. City services from Grand Prairie such as police, fire, water and sewer will now extend to the new land.\nRylan Yowell, managing director for Provident, said the annexation vote was key to the developer\u2019s partnership with the city. It\u2019s part of a phased agreement with the city to absorb all 5,000 acres. The vote on the 900 acres comes after the City Council annexed 1,500 acres of Goodland in\nDecember\n, and follows a\npattern\nby the municipality of supporting and annexing master-planned communities within its extra-territorial jurisdiction. Grand Prairie committed up to $45 million for new roads, including the nearly-finished Goodland Parkway, a 6-mile arterial linking Highways 360 and 287 that\u2019s expected to open by year\u2019s end.\n\nThe council also approved zoning changes to allow mixed-use and medium-density housing. The vote drew some opposition, mostly from residents worried about property taxes, but passed unanimously.\nProvident is also planning a 25-mile trail network and restoring 1,600 acres of floodplain and creek corridors. Earlier this year it broke ground on The Retreat, a $14 million amenity center with a clubhouse, pool, playground and fishing ponds, set to open in 2026.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The Milestone Group bought a 206-unit apartment complex near Boynton Beach for $46.4 million, marking an uptick in South Florida multifamily investment sales.\nDallas-based Milestone bought the Casa Brera at Toscana Isles at 4725 Via Bari in unincorporated Palm Beach County from Ramsey, New Jersey-based Raia Capital Management, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The deal breaks down to $225,000 per unit.\nHampton Beebe and Avery Klann of Newmark represented the seller.\nThe buyer assumed the seller\u2019s $27.4 million Fannie Mae loan on the property and took out an additional $7.7 million Fannie Mae loan, Vizzda records show. Wells Fargo originated both loans.\nGenerally, buyers take over sellers\u2019 existing loans on properties because the debt has better terms than what the buyer can secure for new financing. The loan Milestone assumed from Raia Capital has an interest rate of 3.93 percent. The current rate is over 5 percent.\nAgency loans also tend to have better terms than bank financing, experts have said.\nThe purchase price is a roughly 20 percent discount from replacement cost in the \u201csupply-constrained\u201d submarket, David Giles, vice president of acquisitions at Milestone, said in the firm\u2019s news release about the deal.\nCompleted in 2013, Casa Brera comprises seven, three-story apartment buildings and a pair of one-story clubhouse buildings on a 12.2-acre site, per Vizzda. Raia Capital paid\n$44.4 million\nfor the complex in 2018, records show.\n\nCasa Brera offers one-bedroom to three-bedroom units, with monthly rents ranging from $1,456 to $2,610, according to its website.\nRaia Capital is an investment manager and developer with a portfolio of 3,000 apartments in Florida, Tennessee, Alabama, South Carolina and Missouri, its website shows. Founded by members of the Raia family, it\u2019s led by Samuel A. and Lawrence C. Raia.\nLed by Jeffrey L. Goldberg and Robert P. Landin, Milestone is a multifamily investor that\u2019s made more than $9 billion in investments since it was founded in 2003, according to its website. Its portfolio consists of more than 80,000 units.\nMilestone has been ramping up its South Florida deals in recent years. In 2021, it paid\n$107 million\nfor the 505-unit Emerald Palms apartment complex at 12325 Southwest 151st Street in unincorporated Miami-Dade County, near Zoo Miami. Last year, Milestone bought the 488-unit Axis Delray Beach apartment complex at 1495 Spring Harbor Drive in Delray Beach for\n$111.6 million\n.\nRecords show Milestone still owns both complexes.\nSome South Florida\nmultifamily\ninvestment sales have closed in recent months, despite elevated interest rates, slower demand and lease-ups, and flat \u2013\u2013 and even declining \u2013\u2013 rent growth. Buyers still closing on apartments largely are avoiding higher rates by using all cash or relying on loans from agencies and insurance firms. Some are assuming sellers\u2019 existing debt and others are finding other workarounds.\nThis month, Favo Capital bought the 22-story, 277-unit 1818 Park tower at 1818 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood for\n$190 million\nthrough a deal of all stock and an assumption of liabilities.\nAlso in August, Property Reserve \u2013\u2013 which invests The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\u2019 reserve funds into commercial real estate \u2013\u2013 paid\n$152.5 million\nfor the 384-unit Del Ola apartment complex at 7801 North Federal Highway in Boca Raton. Property Reserve recorded no loan for the deal.\n",

With hundreds of renters vying for just a handful of units, applicants spend hundreds of dollars only to walk away empty-handed.\nThe issue is landing squarely in the city\u2019s heated mayoral race. Hudson County Commissioner Bill O\u2019Dea, one of several candidates, pledged to ban such charges if elected. He told Gothamist he would issue an executive order blocking developers who receive city subsidies from collecting application fees and push for a broader ordinance.\nO\u2019Dea also floated creating a centralized database and standard application process, a move that would make the system more efficient.\nCouncilmember James Solomon backed the idea of banning the application fees.\n\nLandlords defended the fees, arguing they cover costs like credit and background checks. Wendy Paul of the Jersey City Apartment Owners Association told Gothamist her group is open to discussing fee waivers but warned owners need to recover expenses.\nCritics, however, note that multiplied across large applicant pools, the charges add up to a lucrative side stream for property managers.\nThe fight comes as New Jersey faces a statewide shortfall of more than 200,000 affordable units. In Jersey City, where more than 70 percent of residents rent, the pressure is acute. The city\u2019s median rent for a one-bedroom is $2,820, the fourth-highest in the country, according to Zumper.\nBanning application fees on affordable rentals wouldn\u2019t be the only significant change Jersey City landlords have encountered. A few months ago, the City Council\nvoted unanimously\nto ban apartment owners from using products like those from RealPage and Yardi Systems to suggest rents.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Pat Ryan, the insurance titan behind Aon and Ryan Specialty Group, joined the growing list of sellers offloading condos in the Bloomingdale\u2019s building for prices ripped from the 1990s.\nRyan and his wife, Shirley \u2014 namesake of the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab research hospital \u2014 sold their three-bedroom unit on the 62nd floor of the North Michigan Avenue tower for $1.75 million this month, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. That\u2019s a 60 percent haircut from the $4.4 million they paid in 2018. The condo traded for less than it did in 1994, when it sold for about $1.85 million, which would be about $4 million today, adjusted for inflation. The home\u2019s square-footage wasn\u2019t reported.\nIt\u2019s not the first time the billionaire couple has taken a bath in the building. Last December, they sold a unit on the same floor for $1.3 million \u2014 well below the $1.9 million they paid in 1989. The fire-sale pricing underscores a broader trend in the 900 North Michigan Avenue tower, where several recent deals have closed at or below their \u201990s numbers.\nAgents say many longtime owners aren\u2019t investing in updates that could boost resale value. Pam Miles of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices told the outlet that some residents, many of whom split time between multiple homes, are reluctant to endure the hassles of rehabbing, from material deliveries to elevator scheduling. Listing photos of the Ryans\u2019 condo suggested it hadn\u2019t been renovated in years.\n\nFor Ryan \u2014 whose net worth Forbes pegs at nearly $12 billion \u2014 the loss is a rounding error. The 87-year-old mogul built his fortune by founding Ryan Insurance in 1964, growing it into Aon, and later launching Ryan Specialty, now a $10 billion firm. He\u2019s also Northwestern University\u2019s biggest benefactor, funding the school\u2019s $860 million Ryan Field in Evanston.\nBut for Chicago\u2019s\nluxury condo market\n, the Ryans\u2019 sales reinforce an uncomfortable reality: marquee addresses aren\u2019t immune to depreciation, especially when units don\u2019t keep pace with buyers\u2019 expectations.\nRecent sales\nrecorded during the last few days showed losses in value in the millions, such as a three-bedroom condo in the Bloomingdale\u2019s tower that sold for $2.62 million. In 2009, the sellers of the property paid $5 million for it, or nearly twice the recent sale price.\nIn a city where trophy towers once promised\nbulletproof appreciation\n, the Bloomingdale\u2019s building is proving that even billionaire sellers can\u2019t rewrite market math.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Has Houston\u2019s office market bottomed out with the sale of 801 Travis Street?\nThe beleaguered 222,000-square-foot office building traded after nearly a decade on the CMBS loan watchlist. Court records show the sale was approved in June for $12.1 million, or $54 per square foot.\nThe buyer is Rashmi Teja, an entity affiliated with Ramesh Gunda, the CEO of engineering company Gunda Corporation. Gunda did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.\nThe seller is an affiliate of Dallas-based Lincoln Property Company.\nJLL has been hocking the 21-story building that was built in 1981 and renovated in 2014 as a value-add investment opportunity since November.\nAt the time of the listing, it was 43 percent occupied. It had been half-filled for years, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n, but occupancy dipped further when another major tenant, Maryland-based KCI Technologies, left in October. It had occupied 15,000 square feet.\n\nThe $30 million CMBS loan on the property, which was issued in 2013, had a balance of $24 million in July 2024. Around the same time, the building was valued at $19.9 million \u2014 half its 2013 value of $43 million.\nThe property\u2019s loan has shown up on servicer watchlists since 2016, the\nreport\nsaid. A receiver was appointed in February 2024 after the loan matured, court records show.\nLincoln Property Company bought 801 Travis in 2015 on behalf of a pension fund client from Atlanta-based Goddard Investment Group.\nThe building\u2019s distress saga illustrates the broader issues in Houston\u2019s office market, which is saddled with mostly vacant older office buildings that have become obsolete.\nAt the end of the first quarter, vacancy at properties built in the last 15 years averaged 14.9 percent, compared to 27.5 percent in properties constructed before 2009, according to Partners Real Estate.\nDespite the challenges faced by 801 Travis, the submarket it\u2019s located in, Houston\u2019s CBD, is performing well. It was pulling the highest asking rents of any submarket in the city, at about $35 per square foot.\n",

Oren faces six charges, including sex trafficking, conspiracy and aggravated sex abuse, brought by the Southern District of New York.

The rapper was found not guilty of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges in July after a trial in New York federal court. He was convicted on two lesser charges of transportation to engage in prostitution.\nOren, along with fellow former broker Tal and Oren\u2019s twin brother and private security executive Alon, has been in a Brooklyn jail awaiting their January 2026 trial. They were arrested in Miami in December on sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking charges. Prosecutors later added\ncharges\nin two superseding indictments filed in May and June.\nIf convicted, the Alexander brothers could face up to life in prison. All three brothers pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nAgnifilo is a former supervisor at the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of New Jersey and former Manhattan Assistant District Attorney who largely handles cases involving financial fraud and corruption, according to his bio.\nGeragos is a founding partner of Agnifilo Intrater LLP with experience defending and investigating allegations of sexual misconduct, \u201cwhich involve complex legal issues and emotionally charged situations,\u201d according to her bio.\nIntrater is also a founding partner at Agnifilo Intrater. He previously spent eleven years at the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of New Jersey, where he specialized in white collar crime.\nAgnifilo, Geragos and Intrater join Richard Klugh on Oren\u2019s criminal defense team. Alon\u2019s attorneys are Howard Srebnick and Jason Goldman. Tal\u2019s attorneys are Milton Williams, Alexander Vaughan Kahn and Deanna Paul of Walden Macht Haran &amp; Williams LLP.\nOren and Alon are also facing sexual battery charges in Miami-Dade County. Ohad Fisherman, a family friend and former associate of Oren and Tal, was charged alongside the brothers in connection with one allegation.

        "content": "Jessica Tisch, the NYPD commissioner and scion of one of New York\u2019s wealthiest families, has sold her Upper East Side duplex co-op for $10.5 million, a haircut from its original ask but still a healthy gain from the purchase price.\nThe sale of the 4,000-square-foot spread at Nine East 79th Street closed Aug. 12, according to city records cited by\nCrain\u2019s\n. Tisch and her husband, venture capitalist Dan Levine, first listed the prewar four-bedroom last March for $13 million, ultimately shaving about 20 percent off the ask to get it done.\nThe deal breaks down to $2,625 per square foot. The couple bought the unit in 2011 for $8 million from Tisch\u2019s parents, James and Merryl, who helm and represent the family behind Loews Corp.\nThe buyer is Jonathan Berger, co-founder and chief executive officer of TP Birch Grove, a Hudson Yards-based investment arm of Dan Loeb\u2019s hedge fund Third Point, which manages about $12 billion. Berger paid cash, records show.\nThe duplex comes with Central Park views, a formal dining room, a gas fireplace and five and a half baths. But even for pedigreed co-ops in prime UES locations, aspirational pricing has met reality in the past year. Deep-pocketed buyers are still active, but willing to wait out sellers clinging to peak-era numbers.\n\nTisch, 43, has spent her career in city government, moving from Sanitation commissioner under Mayor Eric Adams to NYPD commissioner last year, where she oversees 36,000 officers. Her tenure has already sparked headlines, including the launch of \u201cQ Teams\u201d targeting quality-of-life offenses, a throwback to broken-windows policing that critics warn could disproportionately impact minority communities.\nWhere she and Levine are headed next isn\u2019t clear. Corcoran\u2019s Deborah Grubman, David Adler and Paul Albano had the listing.\nThe co-op isn\u2019t far from Victor Sigoura\u2019s 109 East 79th Street, which recently scored a\ncontract\nfor a 16th-floor condo asking just under $35 million.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The Adam Rubin and Andrew Shanfeld-helmed private equity firm\u2019s deal collapsed, and the property is coming back to market, according to a source familiar with the matter.\nServicer commentary via Morningstar Credit, indicated it was \u201cunable to negotiate acceptable documentation with the selected buyer.\u201d A month earlier, the special servicer said a buyer was selected, approvals were obtained and documentation had commenced. The closing had been expected last month.\nThe deal still would have left Brookfield\u2019s lenders underwater on the $275 million commercial mortgage-backed securities debt connected to the 41-story office tower at 725 South Figueroa Street. It was\nplaced\nin receivership two years ago after Brookfield defaulted on the debt.\nThe 900,000-square-foot office property is valued at $150 million, after an appraisal last year, compared to $446 million four years ago when the debt was issued, Morningstar data shows.\nCarolwood and Eastdil Secured, who was marketing the property, declined to comment. Brookfield and the receiver did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe latest status update from the court-appointed receiver read: \u201cEastdil is now engaged and actively marketing the property for a receiver\u2019s sale. Plaintiff is continuing to evaluate all of its options, including but not limited to foreclosure.\u201d\nThe office tower\u2019s anchor tenant for which it is named after, Ernst &amp; Young has occupied the property since 1999. The company\u2019s lease encompasses 128,000 square feet, about 14 percent of the total space.\nBrookfield has faced significant distress in Los Angeles, particularly downtown, where it has offloaded properties for less than the debt tied to them. It sold\n601 South Figueroa Street\nto Uncommon Developers earlier this summer for $210 million, against a $250 million debt.\nLast summer, the Brookfield-owned\n777 Tower\nsold for $120 million in a forced-sale through lenders, which was less than half of the $319 million debt associated with the property.\n",

The call precedes a formal request for proposals, which will be issued once preliminary visions are submitted.\nThe scope is sweeping. Depending on which scenario a developer pursues, projects could include Festival Hall and adjoining back-of-house spaces, or extend further to cover the Terminal and Shelter buildings, outdoor beer gardens, and 60,000 square feet of the Aon Grand Ballroom. Most of those structures date to the pier\u2019s 1915 origins, while Festival Hall was added during its 1990s redevelopment.\nMore than $450 million of public and private investments have been injected into other parts of the pier in the past dozen years, including a replacement of the ferris wheel, the 223-room\nSable Hotel\nand other south dock projects.\n\nThe nonprofit pitched the opportunity as a \u201cdefining chapter\u201d for the pier, which drew more than 8.5 million\nvisitors\nlast year. The east end alone accounted for $16.5 million in expenses out of $65.9 million in total operating costs, with annual revenues reaching $70.9 million. Developers have until Nov. 3 to submit concepts, with questions allowed before final bids.\nThe effort follows the opening of the privately funded\nNavy Pier Marina\nthis summer, which had been delayed for years over security concerns from City Hall.\nThe 170,000-square-foot Festival Hall has long been a key venue for conventions and exhibitions. Redevelopment could cement the pier\u2019s status as a global attraction and a revenue engine.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The investor-owned entity managed by Signature defaulted on a $39.8 million loan originated in 2016 and modified in 2020. It still owes $1 million on the loan.\nForeclosure could be imminent as a result of the default. Building owners have 90 days from the notice of default to repay.\nThe building was developed in 2015 as part of a larger project, The Hive, which turned a seven-building former car dealership in Uptown Oakland into offices, retail and restaurants. When the apartments opened for rent, residents quickly moved in, the outlet reported. Its assessed value as of last month is about $24 million, or $228,600 per unit.\nSignature Development is working with the lender and investor group to reach a solution, company founder Mike Ghielmetti told the outlet, though he noted \u201cOakland has experienced a slow and anemic recovery from the effects of the pandemic\u201d and, as a result, the developer is \u201csubject to market forces.\u201d\nSignature initially was entitled for 367 units of housing at the site with plans to build a high-rise, but the Oakland-based firm changed course after the 2008 recession. It instead opted to pursue a mixed-use development.\n\nThe distress could add to a string of\nmultifamily properties in Oakland\ngoing back to lenders or selling in a short sale. In April, Signature turned over the Orion Apartments at Brooklyn Basin to its lender via deed in lieu of foreclosure after racking up $138 million in debt and interest on the property.\nLast December,\nThree Steps Properties\nbought the 254-unit building at 447 17th Street for $99 million, representing a 53 percent drop from its assessed value. Quarterra, a subsidiary of the Lennar Corporation, owned that property and took out a $97 million loan in 2020.\nThe following month, The Martin Group bought\n1889 Harrison Street\nin downtown Oakland for $61 million, or about half of its assessed value.\nQuarterra\nalso took out a $70 million loan on the property in 2021.\nIn June, Oakland-based developer oWow gave back 1919 Market Street in West Oakland to its lender via deed in lieu of foreclosure. At the time, there was $50 million in debt on the 102-unit property, dwarfing the building\u2019s $40 million assessed value.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A Taiwanese manufacturing powerhouse partnering with Nvidia is planting a flag in Fort Worth, in a move likely to spur real estate activity in the area.\nWistron confirmed this week that its U.S. subsidiary, Wistron InfoComm USA, will spend $760 million redeveloping twin factories that will assemble next-generation supercomputers, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The facilities will span more than 1 million square feet in north Fort Worth.\nThe plants, expected to open early next year, will employ 888 people and serve as a key hub in Nvidia\u2019s $500 billion effort to build out artificial intelligence infrastructure worldwide. Foxconn and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company are also part of the initiative.\nWistron snapped up two properties this summer in the 27,000-acre master-planned development AllianceTexas. It bought a 324,600-square-foot building at 15200 Heritage Parkway from Trammell Crow Company, which will serve as its primary site with a $580 million investment, and the 767,000-square-foot Westport 14 at 14601 Mobility Way, from Hillwood, where it will spend another $181 million.\nCity and county officials signed off on tax breaks to secure the deal, which quietly came together over recent months.\nJackie Lai, Wistron\u2019s senior vice president of global manufacturing, told the outlet that\nFort Worth\nwon out for its workforce talent and its logistics and industrial infrastructure.\n\nAllianceTexas developer and Hillwood chairman Ross Perot Jr. framed the deal as a watershed for reshoring.\nFor North Texas, the investment marks a full-circle moment. Intel once planned a $2 billion chip plant in the same corridor in the 1990s, before scrapping the project. This time, the momentum is real: Wistron\u2019s move follows activity from MP Materials, which is working on a $500 million rare earth magnet factory nearby in partnership with Apple.\nWistron, one of the world\u2019s largest contract manufacturers, spun off from Acer in 2001 and now produces hardware for some of the biggest names in tech. Its Fort Worth commitment signals the scale of Nvidia\u2019s AI push and the\nregion\u2019s growing role\nin the global supply chain.\nMeanwhile, about 120 miles west of Fort Worth, Denver-based\nVantage Data Centers\nhas teed up a $25 billion tech campus near Abilene.\nThe company is building a 1.4-gigawatt facility in Shackelford County, comprising a 10-building, 1,200-acre data center campus. The first building of the project is expected to be completed late next year. The buildings will span 3.7 million square feet and should create 250 jobs.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Authorities responded to a suspected fire at the former Pfizer headquarters in Manhattan, the site of a highly anticipated Nathan Berman and David Werner residential conversion.\nWork stopped at the massive construction site at 235 East 42nd Street, resulting in hundreds of construction workers milling on the sidewalk while the fire department investigated the situation, according to eyewitness accounts and videos viewed by\nThe Real Deal\n. Work halted for about 20 minutes, according to a member of the construction crew.\nAccording to Berman\u2019s Metro Loft, no fire actually occurred, but the New York Fire Department was called due to smoke coming from the construction site. No damage has been reported, and work resumed after a brief NYFD investigation.\nThe Midtown site is home to the largest office-to-resi conversion in New York City. Nathan Berman\u2019s Metro Loft\nreached a deal\nin March 2024 to convert the former Pfizer headquarters into approximately 1,500 rental units.\n\nBerman purchased a minority stake in the site from David Werner, who had bought the interests in the property five years earlier when Pfizer relocated to Tishman Speyer\u2019s Spiral.\nWerner owns the leasehold of the larger of the two buildings, the 33-story 235 East 42nd Street, after purchasing it for $407 million. He bought the smaller 10-story 219 East 42nd Street in partnership with life sciences developer Alexandria Real Estate Equities for $142 million before buying out the real estate investment trust.\nThe developers have gone through several rounds of financing for the massive undertaking. In May, the pair secured a $700 million construction loan from Madison Realty Capital, a record amount for a residential conversion project in New York.\nNorthwind Group last summer provided a $75 million loan to the joint venture for the property at 219 East 42nd Street, which is also slated for redevelopment. In January, the firm supplied another\n$135 million\nfor the site.\nConstruction is expected to wrap the last quarter of 2027. The combined property, which will host a mix of luxury rentals and affordable housing through the 467m tax abatement program, will include more than 100,000 square feet of amenities and 30,000 square feet of retail space.\n",

        "content": "Boca Raton\u2019s Planning &amp; Zoning Board voted in favor of developers James and Marta Batmasian\u2019s proposal to build a mixed-use hotel near the Mizner Park shopping and entertainment district.\nDespite pleas from downtown area condo residents, the board voted 5 to 1 on Thursday to recommend parking space waivers and other zoning changes that will enable the Batmasians to build Mizner Plaza, a twin 12-story hotel project with 242 rooms, 18,840 square feet of retail and 16,000 square feet of restaurant space at 132 and 170 Northeast Second Street.\nThe\nproject\nwould replace a U.S. Post Office branch and a retail plaza.\nThe board also voted 5 to 1 to recommend that the city transfer its 0.3-acre parking lot at 190 Northeast Second Street to the Batmasians so they can build underground parking for the project.\nBoard member Dorothy MacDiarmid was the lone dissenter for both measures, which will ultimately be decided by Boca Raton\u2019s mayor and city council members at a future meeting.\nThe parking waiver will allow the Batmasians to build just 372 spaces at the 1.9-acre site instead of the 569 spaces currently required, the developers\u2019 land use attorney, Ele Zachariades said. The developers also want to build two-levels of underground parking below what is now a city-owned, 17-space parking lot.\nThe waiver will allow the developer to incorporate a stepped-style crafted by Boca Raton-architecture firm HdA that would place the retail, restaurant spaces and amenities on the first, second, fourth and 12th floors of the hotel, Zachariades said.\nThe hotel rooms would be between 380 and 1,100 square feet in size, according to a memo.\nThe Batmasians offered to replace the lot\u2019s 17 parking spaces and turn the above ground area into a mini public park. But the majority of the planning and zoning board sided with city staffers\u2019 recommendation that the developers pay the city for the land\u2019s appraised $2.4 million value with nearly $900,000 in cash and the rest in public improvements and maintenance credits related to the spaces and future park.\nWithout the parking waiver and city land, the developers would pursue a design that would end up blocking most condo dwellers\u2019 views and consist almost entirely of hotel rooms, Zachariades said.\n\nBut residents at the neighboring\nTower 155\n, a complex finished in 2020 that is up to 150 feet tall, asked the board to vote no on the project or delay it for further analysis.\nJeff Costello, a planning consultant retained by Tower 155\u2019s condo association, said there will be more than 2,400 daily new trips in the area once the hotel is built, much of it going through a 20-foot alleyway between Tower 155 and the future development.\nRichard De Witt, an attorney representing the same asociation, argued that the project should be delayed because it did not go through proper procedures and that the sale of the parking lot should go out to bid.\nDe Witt also pointed out that a previous appraisal for the land done by the city\u2019s consultant, Walter Duke &amp; Associates, put the value of the land at $3.3 million.\n\u201cOnce the developers saw that they balked at the price and demanded a new appraisal,\u201d De Witt told the board, adding that the Batmasians want \u201cto pay zero\u201d for the land.\nZachariades countered that the first appraisal included public properties that were not part of her clients\u2019 undergrounding plans.\nMost board members, though, said the project would help revitalize the Mizner Park district and Boca Raton\u2019s downtown area.\n\u201cI do think it is a beautiful building. Mizner needs something. Mizner has a lot of problems,\u201d board member Timothy Dornblaser said.\nThis is the second hotel plan the Batmasians have proposed near Mizner Park.\nAn earlier proposal\n, made in the summer of 2023, would have consisted of two 11-story buildings with 266 hotel rooms and 32,400 square feet of retail and restaurants.The Batmasians founded Investments Limited in the early 1980s and have become one of the biggest real estate developers in the Boca Raton area. James Batmasian served eight months in prison after pleading guilty for evading $250,000 in payroll taxes in 2008. But he was pardoned by President Donald Trump in\nDecember 2020\n.\n",

        "content": "Two years after falling into bankruptcy and closing all of its stores across the United States, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is poised for a retail comeback \u2014 just not in California.\nMarcus Lemonis, executive chairman and principal executive officer of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond parent company Beyond Incorporated, handed down the decree, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. California won\u2019t get any Bed Bath &amp; Beyond storefronts as the company prepares to relaunch some brick-and-mortar operations.\n\u201cThis decision isn\u2019t about politics; it\u2019s about reality,\u201d Lemonis said. \u201cCalifornia has created one of the most overregulated, expensive, and risky environments for businesses in America. It\u2019s a system that makes it harder to employ people, harder to keep doors open, and harder to deliver value to customers.\u201d\nCompanies that operate in the Golden State face \u201chigher taxes, higher fees, higher wages that many businesses simply cannot sustain, and endless regulations that strangle growth,\u201d he said.\n\nBed Bath &amp; Beyond filed for\nbankruptcy\nin 2023 and closed all 360 of its stores from coast to coast. In early 2022, a year before the troubled retailer filed for bankruptcy, there were 87 Bed Bath &amp; Beyond locations in California, per Statista.\nThe company is in the midst of a rebirth as Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Home. The first location opened in Nashville earlier this month. About 75 former Kirkland\u2019s Home locations across the country are expected to turn into Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Home stores by next year.\nCustomers in California will still have access to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond\u2019s inventory via the company\u2019s website. In response to Lemonis\u2019 statement, Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s office brushed off the executive\u2019s rebuff of the state.\n\u201cAfter their bankruptcy and closure of every store, like most Americans, we thought Bed Bath &amp; Beyond no longer existed,\u201d the governor\u2019s office wrote on social media. \u201cWe wish them well in their efforts to become relevant again as they try to open a second store.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "An East Austin landfill that closed decades ago has become the unlikely roadblock to one of the city\u2019s most ambitious mixed-use projects.\nGraham Development is suing Travis County after officials denied its plan to relocate an auto scrapyard to a 42-acre site at 9500 East U.S. Highway 290 \u2014 a former landfill that stopped accepting waste in 1982 but allegedly still leaks toxins into nearby soil and water, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe Austin-based firm needs the scrapyard, LKQ Auto Salvage, off its South Congress Avenue property in order to move forward with a planned 43-acre project that would deliver more than 1,200 apartments, 210,000 square feet of offices, and 136,000 square feet of retail. The development would be positioned next to where Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority is building a new\nOrange Line\nrail route.\nThe problem: LKQ\u2019s lease at 7900\nSouth Congress Avenue\nruns until 2036. Without relocating it, Graham\u2019s transit-oriented project is stuck in limbo. The developer and the landfill\u2019s owner, Moo Moo Meadows, filed a lawsuit July 31 in federal court, arguing the county exceeded its authority when it blocked the scrapyard relocation and claiming the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality \u2014 not the county \u2014 should decide land use questions for closed landfills.\n\nThe suit also accused Travis County of decades of neglect, saying the landfill has been leaking hazardous leachate into the ground since the 1960s and still tests positive for unsafe levels of arsenic, barium and lead. Graham alleges the county is using the contamination as a \u201cbludgeon\u201d to stifle development.\nCounty officials pushed back, pointing to ongoing cooperation with TCEQ and past efforts to address the landfill. Travis County commissioners voted unanimously in August 2023 to deny the scrapyard move, citing risks to human health and environmental safety.\nThe stakes go beyond legal wrangling. The South Congress project could reshape a corridor already under heavy development pressure, bringing both density and affordable housing to a rapidly growing part of the city. But until the scrapyard has left the vision on ice.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "New Yorkers retreat to the Hudson Valley to escape the hustle and bustle of city life.\nThey find refuge in the quieter expanses in a two-hour range of Manhattan, where drool-worthy properties aren\u2019t glitzy high-rise condos, but quaint farmhouses, Victorian mansions and sprawling estates. Historically, the firms trading those properties were boutique mainstays that embrace the pace of small(er) town life.\nEnter Serhant.\nThe five-year-old brokerage\nset up shop\nin the region in October with a 10-person team poached from Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices\u2019 Hudson Valley franchise.\nThe then-four-year-old brokerage was relatively early\namong its New York City-born competitors\nin establishing a Hudson Valley presence. Corcoran launched Corcoran Country Living in 2020 and Compass earlier this year added the 14-agent Upstate Untapped Team.\nThe interest from brokerages has followed a rising tide in the Hudson Valley market. Home prices hit record highs last year, just as Serhant opened its doors, with the median sale price in every county in the region beating $300,000, the Times Union reported earlier this year.\nAlmost a year into the Garay-Michaud Team\u2019s tenure at the brokerage and it appears the team has embraced the firm\u2019s signature social media- and content-friendly stunts to sell homes.\nThis week, broker Jordan Vaccaro hosted roughly 60 brokers at a mountaintop estate in East Fishkill for a sunset soiree, complete with a DJ and private chef. An unusual addition to the broker open house \u2014 off-road ATV tours of the 120-acre property, on the market for just under $4 million. (Vaccaro had initially planned for a helicopter to sail over 401 Woodmount Road, known as the Cloud Walk Estate, but wind conditions kept the party grounded.)\nCruising between the estate\u2019s two homes, barn and three-car garage meant a trove of Instagram-worthy shots, and while taking an ATV around the streets of Manhattan likely won\u2019t happen any time soon, the footage posted on social media rivals the drone shots of Billionaires\u2019 Row towers that Serhant is famous for.\n\u201cJaws\u201d in the Hamptons\nA luxury residential broker who\u2019s a fixture in Manhattan\u2019s social scene said she was caught in a beachfront fray in East Hampton this week. Gail Bomze, a 75-year-old Compass agent who has brought eight-figure listings to the market, was accused of biting a seven-year-old in a dust-up at a community concert.\nAn\narrest report seen by Page Six\ndescribed an account from an event worker that a woman was seen \u201ckicking and punching kids\u201d to get hold of a t-shirt thrown as a giveaway at a beach concert in East Hampton last week. In the frenzy, a child told police, a woman \u201cgrabbed her right arm and bit,\u201d drawing blood.\nBomze, who was arrested Tuesday and charged with third-degree assault and endangering a child, has denied the allegations. In a statement to the outlet, her attorney said Bomze was instead \u201cknocked to the ground\u201d in the chaos of the t-shirt toss and reported the incident to organizers, who returned with an apology for the fray.\n\nNot so fast\u2026\nMayor Eric Adams\u2019 administration is back in the news this week after two of the New York City leader\u2019s associates\nwere indicted\non Thursday.\nProsecutors accused the mayor\u2019s former aide, Ingrid Lewis-Martin, of accepting bribes and other perks from real estate developers in exchange for helping them secure city contracts and expediting their projects.\nJesse Hamilton\n, who oversaw the city\u2019s office leasing portfolio, allegedly conspired with Lewis-Martin and heeded her directives to give certain developers preference.\nThe developers identified in the indictments are Tian Ji Li and Yechiel Landau. One of the indictments also alleges Lewis-Martin conspired with Anthony and Gina Argento, the owners of a production studio, to ditch the protected bike lanes included in the redevelopment plans for McGuinness Boulevard in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.\nLewis-Martin \u2014 who was already facing charges in a December indictment \u2014 allegedly accepted $75,000 worth of bribes over two years, including a speaking role in the TV show \u201cGodfather of Harlem.\u201d\nHamilton resigned from his post at the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, or DCAS, on Thursday following news of the indictment. Lewis-Martin resigned from the administration last year.\nAdams was previously facing federal charges of fraud and bribery, among others, though a federal judge dropped the case in April.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe priciest deal to land in public records this week was a condo at Extell Development\u2019s One57, which traded at a loss. Unit 51C at the Billionaires\u2019 Row tower sold for just under $15 million, or $4,300 per square foot \u2014 down from its 2015 purchase price of $19 million.\nThe discount is in line with other\nresales at the building\n, which has seen units trade for roughly 24 percent less than their sponsor sale price.\nThe four-bedroom, four-bathroom apartment has drifted on and off the market since 2018, when it was listed for $22 million, and last asked $18 million.\nBespoke had the listing.\n",

        "content": "Remember when real estate executives were dropping Andrew Cuomo and backing Eric Adams\u2019 re-election bid?\nThat now seems like\nages ago\n, and I\u2019m hearing from some in the industry that we shouldn\u2019t expect the level of spending that we saw in the lead up to the primary \u2014 on either candidate. One source noted that industry insiders were shocked by Cuomo\u2019s loss in the primary and responded by throwing their support behind Adams. Some may now step back, the source said.\nThis week, I asked readers of this newsletter \u2014\u00a0specifically those who had decided after the primary to back Adams \u2014 if they had changed their mind given the mayor\u2019s place in the polls and the additional corruption\nallegations\nagainst those in his inner circle.\nI heard from two people who firmly feel the mayor\u2019s fate in the election shouldn\u2019t be swayed by the accusations against his former top aide and his former real estate chief. Nor the\npotato chip incident\nwith former aide Winnie Greco. They also remained supportive of the mayor, even after he was personally indicted (charges that were dismissed this year).\n\u201cI am sticking with re-electing Mayor Adams because I think he did a pretty good job considering that he had so little support from the City Council and had an impossible job fixing all the mistakes made by [Bill] de Blasio\u2019s disastrous mayoralty,\u201d attorney Stuart Saft said in an email.\nFor his part, the mayor was defiant at a press conference on Friday, noting that some reporters had asked his staff if he was going to announce his exit from the race. He said he couldn\u2019t leave the city to the other candidates in the race.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come too far to go backwards,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThat is not going to happen.\u201d\nOthers in the industry appear to be watching and waiting. For example, RXR\u2019s Scott Rechler, who indicated last month he was open to supporting Adams, has not formally decided who to support, per a rep. He previously donated $250,000 to Fix the City, a super PAC tied to Cuomo.\nToday was the deadline for mayoral campaigns to report their donation hauls between July 12 and August 18. As of early Friday evening, the filings for most of the campaigns were not on the Campaign Finance Board\u2019s website.\nI was able to start sorting through Mamdani\u2019s filings. He reported taking in more than $1 million during this period. The filings indicate that roughly $19,700 came from real estate-related donors (including those who identified as working in real estate, development, brokerage, property management, construction and architecture). That included a $2,100 contribution from Obaid Khan, chief financial officer at Tishman Realty.\nI\u2019m expecting to see donations pop up from fundraisers held for Adams last month (the results of an SL Green fundraiser didn\u2019t seem to be in the last set of filings). The race is fluid, and the donations made in July already seem somewhat stale, perhaps not reflective of where the industry stands today in the race.\n\nOf course, that won\u2019t stop us from writing about which real estate executive donated to each of the campaigns, so keep an eye out for that.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nMore mayoral candidates should want to sit down and talk to nerds. Specifically, this nerd here \u2014 me. With this in mind, I ask you: Will Zohran Mamdani\u2019s press people ever respond to me? Send help to kathryn@therealdeal.com.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: In 2010, Houston, Texas,\nbanned\na number of attention-getting items that are typical outside car dealerships \u2014\u00a0think giant inflatable gorilla strapped to a roof or those brightly colored \u201ctube men\u201d that thrash in the wind. The changes were made over traffic safety concerns,\nper Next City\n.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\u00a0The family of Julia Hyman, the 27-year-old Rudin associate killed in the Midtown mass shooting last month, has hired a lawyer to investigate her death, according to the\nNew York Post\n. A source told the paper the elevators should have been shut down as soon as the shooter entered with a semi-automatic rifle, which might have prevented him from getting past the lobby. The family is also looking into whether Rudin provided adequate security given the building\u2019s high-profile tenants.\n\u2014\u00a0The city issued a permit to self-driving taxi company Waymo for a pilot program,\nGothamist\nreports. The permit allows the company to test eight self-driving cars on city streets, provided a driver is present and no passengers are on board. \u2014\nQuinn Waller\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$13.3 million\nfor a condominium unit at 443 Greenwich Street. The Tribeca condo is 3,000 square feet and last sold on the market for $8 million in 2018.\nDouglas Elliman\nhas the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$28.9 million\nat 229 West 43rd Street. The New York Times building retail space formerly owned by the Kushner family sold at a steep discount of $114 per square foot.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $10.5 million for a condo unit at 127 East 64th Street. The Lenox Hill condo is 4,000 square feet and is listed by\nCompass\u2019\nTrade Residential Team.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

That\u2019s when Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team, who compiles the group\u2019s weekly signed contracts report, suggested the possibility of a buyer\u2019s market \u201cin the near future.\u201d That\u2019s when the brokerage\u2019s data pointed to weekly growth of luxury listings, without comparable signed contracts to offset the inventory ramp. In the case of the week ended March 15, there were 23 homes that went into contract, while 97 listings were added.\nThe most recent Eklund Gomes report for the week ended Aug. 17 had 20 signed contracts, while 76 homes were added to the market.\n\u201cThe word I would use is challenging because the market is shifting, but not completely,\u201d said Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California COO Nina Zokhrabyan. \u201cYes, it is a buyer\u2019s market, but interest rates are high.\u201d\nThe part of the cycle L.A. real estate finds itself in is at a \u201cweird moment\u201d in time, she said.\nIn some cases, sellers still think their properties are worth what they originally asked, and buyers are seeing through the glossy photos and marketing speak.\nMuch like how the industry talked up good agenting following last year\u2019s NAR settlement over an antitrust lawsuit on commissions, this is where skill matters, some say.\n\u201cThe sellers and the buyers are now trying to figure out that price, that happy medium, and this is where the agents come in,\u201d Zokhrabyan said. \u201cIf you have really good agents on both ends, they\u2019ll be able to navigate and negotiate on the buyer\u2019s and seller\u2019s behalf to make the deal.\u201d\nULA throws off \u201cnormal\u201d cycle\nThere\u2019s more on Zokhrabyan\u2019s point about the market oddities.\nThat\u2019s so for a couple of reasons that are not cyclical. First off, there\u2019s the\nMeasure United to House LA\nfactor that has impacted the $5 million and above market.\nThe tiered tax for properties only in the city of Los Angeles kicks in with deals of $5.3 million getting assessed a 4 percent levy and 5.5 percent on those $10.6 million or more. The thresholds are adjusted annually by the city.\nThe \u201cmansion tax\u201d has been a wet blanket for deals since the November 2022 ballot measure went into effect in April 2023.\nThe Agency\u2019s Santiago Arana has a client, David Maman of David Maman Design, who in March sold 1050 Stradella Road in Bel-Air for $25 million and had to pay $2 million for\nULA\n. The end result was no profit on the sale.\nThe developer bought the property in 2018 for $4.8 million, built it anew into a seven-bedroom, 16-bathroom mansion and listed it in March 2024 for $33.8 million.\n\u201cULA, the fires, the economy\u2014all that has created uncertainty in the L.A. market,\u201d Arana said.\nThe fires factor\nThe question of insurance bubbles up to the surface when looking at post-fire recovery and dealmaking.\nAltadena, Pasadena, Pacific Palisades and Malibu are all coming back from January\u2019s Palisades and Eaton fires. The blazes razed whole neighborhoods and communities, but it also added to jitters around the state\u2019s existing insurance crisis.\nInsurance\n, which one needs for a mortgage, is hard to come by or quite pricey.\n\u201cInsurance has quietly become one of the biggest deal killers in California real estate,\u201d said\u00a0 Parker Beatty, Compass regional vice president of Southern California and Hawaii.\u00a0 \u201cPost-fires, it\u2019s now one of the first questions a buyer asks, and the rising cost of ownership can spook people. With traditional insurance pulling back, many homeowners are being pushed into the state\u2019s\nFAIR Plan\n. Enrollments nearly doubled this year, highlighting both the depth of the problem and the scramble for solutions.\u201d\n\nThose in real estate can usually find the bright side, and Parker said there are opportunities to be had in the challenges: \u201cThose willing to navigate it are finding openings that others overlook,\u201d he said.\nMowbrays\u2019 $65M Moves in Malibu\nBrothers\nNick and Mat Mowbray\nfound success in toys, but recent real estate acquisitions in Malibu could place them at the forefront of the city\u2019s fire rebuilding process.\nThe Mowbrays are behind the mysterious buys of nine plots of land on Malibu\u2019s La Costa and Carbon beaches after the fires, spending $65 million on the real estate. The transactions were first reported by\nRealtor.com\n, and\nKevin Shelburn\nof Mar Vista-based Shelburn Realty Group sleuthed out the buyers\u2019 identity.\nIt\u2019s what the Mowbrays plan to do with the land that\u2019s now most interesting. The company did not return requests for comment on the purchases this past week, but one wonders if the oceanfront lots will be case studies for the Mowbrays\u2019 Zuru Tech pre-fabricated housing subsidiary. That\u2019s the software platform that promises the ability to design a custom home or commercial property online, with the components built in a factory and then delivered to the site.\nLast year, Nick Mowbray told\nBloomberg\nthe business is expected to \u201cdwarf everything we\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\nPerhaps Malibu will have a front-row seat to that.\nWhat buyer\u2019s market? $110M listing hits Santa Monica\nBranden and Rayni Williams are testing the theory of the ultra-wealthy bubble that can skirt broader market trends.\nThe Beverly Hills Estates co-founders placed a\n$110 million listing\non the market that is Santa Monica\u2019s priciest home for sale and one of eight in Los Angeles County in the nine-figure club.\nFor as much as agents talk up \u201cunique\u201d properties selling, 859 Woodacres Road really fits that profile. The 12,000-square-foot residence, asking $9,167 per square foot, sits at the Riviera Country Club\u2019s 7th hole and was designed by the late Howard Backen. The architect was known for his residential and winery work.\nThe asking price is about a 168 percent jump from the last known trade, which occurred off market in 2017. That\u2019s when the property sold for $41.1 million. At the time, the closing was Santa Monica\u2019s priciest-ever deal.\nChunk of OC history up for sale\nOrange County history buffs will appreciate this one.\nCompass\u2019 Annie Clougherty and Mike Johnson brought\n245 Crescent Bay Drive\nonto the market with an ask of just under $20 million. The estate of James and Martha Newkirk, the couple who bought the property in 1979, is selling the Laguna Beach home. The four-bedroom, five-bathroom property spans about 6,900 square feet and looks out onto the Pacific Ocean.\nThe home\u2019s only traded hands a few times since the 19th century.\nThat starts with the 1905 sale of what was once part of Irvine ranch to the McKnight family from the Irvine family. Irvine Ranch was made up of Spanish and Mexican land grants from 1864 and is the predecessor to the Irvine Company.\nThe McKnight family\u2019s L.C. McKnight was among a group of individuals who are credited with developing Laguna Cliffs, the first neighborhood in Laguna Beach.\nIn the 1920s, planes flown by Florence Lowe \u201cPancho\u201d Barnes passed by and landed close to the Crescent Bay Drive property. Barnes started the first stunt pilots union and broke Amelia Earhart\u2019s air speed record in 1930.\nNow, Chateau du Soleil\u2019s big claim is that it sits across from Los Angeles Times\u2019 billionaire owner Patrick Soon-Shiong\u2019s blufftop estate, which he bought for $45 million in 2016.\n",

        "content": "A development site in the West Loop that\u2019s zoned for up to 362 multifamily units is hitting the market during a historic supply drought.\nBut it\u2019s not just available space that developers are looking for. It\u2019s lower interest rates, lower construction costs, willing lenders and a more predictable property tax environment.\nIf the West Loop site sells, it will be because the appeal of the property has overcome all the other headwinds developers are facing in the city.\nLocated at 309 South Green Street, the listing consists of a parking lot and an industrial, loft-style office. With access to Fulton Market directly north and the Loop directly east, the site could benefit from demand for housing from young professionals. It is being marketed by Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s Susan Tjanksen and Anna Lovell; the seller hasn\u2019t been identified.\nFewer than 300 units are slated for delivery this year, a historically low figure for the market, Integra Realty Resources found. It\u2019s been difficult to get apartment projects off the ground, but those that do get started will benefit from the city\u2019s strong rent growth.\n\nDowntown Chicago\u2019s luxury apartment rents rose 2.56 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarter, reaching $3.60 per square foot, Integra found. Rents in general are expected to grow 4 percent this year.\nJust north of the listing, Fulton Market is seeing some of the only major multifamily developments taking off.\nIn May, Cedar Street scored a discount on a Fulton Market property, setting the stage for a 300-unit apartment project. The Chicago-based firm paid $6.5 million for the former Leslie Hindman Auctioneers property at 1332 and 1338 West Lake Street.\nThe two connected buildings span roughly 36,000 square feet on just over half an acre at the northeast corner of Lake and Ada streets. Hindman listed it for sale in mid-2020 with an $11 million asking price.\nAn asking price isn\u2019t included in the 309 South Green listing but it will likely sell for a significant markup. The property has been held in a trust since the 1990s when it sold for just $375,000.",

That led to a lawsuit from\nlenders\nincluding JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank over unpaid debt.\nAt one point, San Francisco Centre was one of the best-performing malls on the West Coast, but it\u2019s largely become a ghost town. The shopping center is between 30 percent and 40 percent occupied, according to the\nSan Francisco Examiner\n, representing a steep drop from 96 percent in 2016. By that estimate, between 750,000 and 1 million square feet is vacant at the 1.5 million-square-foot mall.\nThe mall\u2019s court-appointed receiver Trident Pacific and real estate broker JLL are not involved in the auction process.\n\nRetailers and restaurants have been running for the doors over the past two years.\nIn 2023, Nordstrom\nclosed\nits flagship at the mall as part of its citywide exodus. It was followed by another anchor department store,\nBloomingdale\u2019s\n, earlier this year. Several other retailers have exited in recent months, including\nZara\n, Steve Madden, Kate Spade, Sunglass Hut, Oak + Fort and Razer electronics.\nIt\u2019s gotten harder to find a bite to eat at the barren shopping center. Restaurants and food court outposts have closed up shop, with the latest departees including Jamba Juice, Blondie\u2019s Pizza, Izzy &amp; Wooks sandwich shop, Mija Cochinita taco shop, Mai Savory Hot Dogs and a Fires of Brazil barbecue restaurant.\nFoot traffic has dropped off significantly as the mall empties out. Visitors to San Francisco Centre fell 63.3 percent between 2019 and 2024, according to the\nSan Francisco Business Times\n. It was just as bad from January to May of this year with foot traffic down 68 percent from the same period in 2019 and between 25 and 40 percent year-over-year.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

It\u2019s supposed to be completed by 2031. The city said the project could accommodate up to 1 million passengers annually, providing an alternative to Dallas Fort Worth International and Love Field.\nThe airport expansion has inspired other industrial developments, too.\nHolley Development Company\nrecently collected 461 acres nearby for an industrial development.\n\nMcKinney Air Business Park will enjoy easy access to the future Spur 399, an eight-lane freeway currently under construction that would connect U.S. 75 with U.S. 380.\nThe airport expansion project and construction of Spur 399 come as Collin County, home to McKinney, is growing residents by the bushel: the county added around 46,700 residents between July 2023 and July 2024, according to the latest U.S. Census Bureau estimates.\nCaprock specializes in acquiring and developing industrial real estate in Texas, Colorado, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, California, Oregon and Washington.

The office tower was once valued at $446 million four years ago.\nTo receive, or not to receive\nThe Rising Realty Partners-owned One California Plaza could be placed in\nreceivership\nafter defaulting on $300 million of CMBS debt, if the court agrees to the lender\u2019s request.\nOn behalf of the loan holders and through a special servicer, US Bank requested a receiver be appointed to take possession of the foreclosed, 1-million-square-foot office tower downtown and collect rents, according to a complaint filed in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County. The complaint notes that the plaintiff believes the borrower intends to consent to the appointment of a receiver.\nChristopher Rising\u2019s company and Colony Capital purchased the office tower at 300 South Grand Avenue for $465 million eight years ago. But the 42-story, Bunker Hill office property is now worth less than the debt connected to it and less than its purchase price. A recent appraisal put its value at about $121 million, compared to $459 million at loan issuance in 2017.\nPost-pandemic occupancy is down at the property to about 63 percent this year compared to 88 percent at underwriting.\n\u201cBorrower is in default under the loan documents and is depriving plaintiff of its interest in the rents, causing material, immediate and irreparable damage to plaintiff,\u201d the complaint reads. It later notes: \u201cunless a receiver is appointed, plaintiff will suffer great and irreparable damage.\u201d\nValue haircut\nRealty Bancorp\u2019s Los Angeles County office portfolio ran into some more\ntrouble\n. After the roughly $67 million in CMBS debt connected to the five-property portfolio landed in special servicing, the borrower became delinquent, with the offices worth less than half as much as it was at underwriting six years ago.\nThe 346,800-square-foot portfolio, located throughout Aguora Hills, Woodland Hills and Calabasas, was recently appraised at $47.8 million compared to $101.6 million in 2019.\nOne of the Aguora Hills properties was home to the Los Angeles Rams for nine years, but the team\u2019s billionaire owner, Stan Kroenke, moved the headquarters, part of a $10 billion development plan at Warner Center in Woodland Hills. Total occupancy declined to 72 percent at the end of June from 98 percent at underwriting six years ago \u2014 and the office buildings are not bringing in enough money to pay off the debt.\nThe latest servicer commentary notes that the borrower is requesting a short term forbearance, or a temporary suspension of loan payments for a set period, which the special servicer is reviewing.\n\nHundreds of million in bonds\nOne Beverly Hills could receive up to $550 million in bond\nfinancing\n, after the Beverly Hills City Council gave developers Cain International and OKO Group the greenlight to allot a Community Facilities District.\nThat means of the $550 million special taxes, $390 million would be used to fund public improvements and $160 million would be allocated for \u201cfuture city council to fund major repairs or enhancements to the public improvements decade from now without needing to revisit voter approvals,\u201d according to a presentation at the council meeting.\nThe 17.5-acre mixed-use development is set to include an Aman resort, two condominium towers and the renovation of Beverly Hilton hotel. Development is underway after the city council approved the plan in 2021, and the project is anticipated to be completed three years from now. Revenues would then be used to repay the bonds.\n\u201cThe CFDs really act like takeout financing,\u201d Cain\u2019s managing director said at the council meeting. \u201cIt is not a gift or a subsidy. There is no financial risk to the city, and there is no impact to the existing taxpayers outside of the CFD.\u201d\nMega-project moves\nMore development news out of the opulent Beverly Hills: the city planning commission\nvoted\nin favor of Saks Fifth Avenue parent company Saks Global\u2019s 3.7 acre mixed-use development. The approval came despite criticism during the public hearing, and with some amendments to logistics such as an area for pedestrians to walk and retail and restaurant space.\n\u201cAt the last meeting, there were questions about the retail and restaurant distribution. To clarify this issue and move the project forward, we\u2019re prepared to accept a limit of 15,088 square feet of restaurant use, as shown on the concept plan, exclusive of the hotel and private club,\u201d Douglas Adams, senior vice president of Saks\u2019 real estate development arm, said during the August meeting.\nThe plan calls for 76 apartments, a boutique hotel, a spa, a social club, 45,000 square feet of offices and 64,000 square feet of retail \u2014 and is designed by Marmol Radziner. It is expected to take more than four years to complete.\nHollywood refi\nHackman Capital Partners and Affinius Capital secured a three-year, $165 million\nfinancing\npackage for Raleigh Studios. The financing will be used to repay $135 million of existing debt.\nNetflix leases most of the 314,940-square-foot Hollywood film studio as a hub for some of its biggest-budget deals that include production companies owned by Former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and Shonda Rhimes \u2014 the woman who gave the world\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy\n. The streaming giant is about halfway through a 10-year lease.\nHackman, Affinius, and Raleigh Enterprises are all owners: Hackman holds a 36 percent stake, Affinius 34 percent and Raleigh Enterprises 30 percent, though the latter has owned the property since 1979.\n",

        "content": "As Mayor Brandon Johnson strives to reset his standing with voters and Chicago\u2019s real estate community, some more of the city\u2019s big landlords are working to reset theirs with lenders.\nJohnson is a little over halfway through his first term, but his\nreal estate report card\nis a mixed bag. Go inside his grades on real estate-related policies according to industry players and a deputy mayor, from an A for\neliminating parking minimums\nto an F for his\nfailed transfer tax hike\n.\nLenders keep piling up lawsuits in the office market. New York-based\nFeil Organization\nis staring down foreclosure on a 35,000-square-foot West Loop loft office on Madison Street, after occupancy fell below 50 percent. It\u2019s just the latest Chicago headache for Feil, which already\nsurrendered a River North property\nand is battling\nlitigation over its LaSalle Street tower\n.\n\nIn the multifamily market, student housing\nsyndicator Versity Investments has fallen behind on $83 million in loans\ntied to The Buckingham and Tailor Lofts, two student towers near Roosevelt and UIC, respectively.\nBut bigger deals are getting back to flowing. Stuart Handler\u2019s firm\nTLC dropped $100 million on a Vernon Hills apartment complex\nto mark the highest price in the suburbs so far this year. In Chicago, developer\nNoah Properties scored a $34 million exit for The Avondale\n, a 52-unit rental townhome complex on Belmont Avenue. The buyer is eyeing a rare rental-to-condo conversion, flipping the script on a decade of deconversions.\nDevelopment site prices remain down. In the Gold Coast, investor Don Wilson\u2019s real estate firm\nConvexity scooped up a property entitled for 304 apartments\nat 1120 North State Street for $39 million, more than a third below its 2019 sale price. The parcel was once slated for a 42-story tower, but may see a fresh plan under Convexity.\nThe\nmegaproject once set to transform the Chicago River\u2019s North Branch\nis splintering some more.\nSterling Bay has put the only finished Lincoln Yards building\non the market \u2014 a vacant 284,000-square-foot lab-and-office property at 1229 West Concord. Once envisioned as the anchor to a $6 billion neighborhood, it now overlooks empty land that\nnew developers, JDL and Kayne Anderson, move ahead\nhave rebranded portions of with new plans for over 3,000 apartments.",

        "content": "The Trump administration\u2019s sweeping deportations raised an alarm for apartment associations recently, amid reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers hitting landlords with subpoenas seeking information on tenants.\nThe National Apartment Association and the Apartment Association of Greater Dallas\nissued advisories\non the federal overreach, informing members of the difference between the immediate urgency of a warrant, and a subpoena, which doesn\u2019t have to be answered right away.\nEven though Dallas-Fort Worth is the market where ICE is most actively cracking down, there is little evidence of multifamily landlords being hit with ICE subpoenas. But that has been reported in Georgia and Massachusetts.\nTexas politicians who have spoken out against ICE raids in Texas, such as U.S. Representative Greg Casar, haven\u2019t yet weighed in on the situation.\nHere\u2019s more Texas real estate news from this week.\nAustin lost an influential real estate player with the death of brokerage executive and developer\nTodd Wallace\n. Wallace, who was president of JLL\u2019s Central Texas region and CEO of CSW Development, died late last month after a six-year battle with cancer. He was 53.\n\nAshford Hospitality Trust, led by Dallas investor Monty Bennett, failed to refinance a $580 million hotel portfolio, according to the loan\u2019s special servicer, as reported by Morningstar Credit. The firm said it received an\nextension until January\nand is waiting for interest rates to drop before refinancing. The portfolio, comprising 18 hotels across 13 states (with several in Texas), went into special servicing in June after a missed balloon payment.\nThere is optimism in Austin\u2019s multifamily market, despite the area\u2019s\noversupply\nof new apartments. Occupancy dropped to 85 percent and average rents are down 7.5 percent year-over-year, making financing and valuations more difficult. However, reduced construction starts and strong absorption suggest the market may rebound next year.\nAustin-based\nCapital Commercial Investments\nacquired Energy Crossing I in West Houston, after buying its twin, Energy Crossing II, last year. The buildings, purchased from Dallas-based Invesco Real Estate, span 560,000 square feet. Capital Commercial Investments, helmed by Doug Agarwal, has been targeting newer suburban office properties amid a market trend favoring modern buildings.\nThe most expensive home sold in Houston last month was a 1938 mansion at\n2110 River Oaks Boulevard\n, which was listed for $18.9 million, or $2,004 per square foot. The 1.6-acre estate includes a 9,400-square-foot main house and two additional dwellings, and was purchased by philanthropists Martha Long and Sean Wade.\nThe Dallas City Council unanimously rejected a proposal to ditch the city\u2019s\n\u201cpay-to-delay\u201d ordinance\n, which allows nearby property owners to postpone zoning cases for a $150 fee. The decision highlighted the divide between the council and Mayor Eric Johnson, who is pushing for streamlined development and zoning reforms.\n",

        "content": "Upwards of 20,000 apartment units in San Francisco\nare in limbo\nas projects face years of delays or fall by the wayside entirely.\nOnly 1,453 housing units were completed last year, representing less than a third of the more than 5,000 delivered in 2020. Last year, plans were filed for just 2,541 new homes. Meanwhile, the city is way behind on its state-mandated goal of permitting 82,000 units by 2031 as part of its Housing Element.\nResidential developments like\nTreasure Island\n,\nMission Rock\nand\n5M\nadded hundreds of housing units during the pandemic. But apartment starts have largely stalled in recent years as developers deal with inflation, city fees, a construction materials shortage and tariffs.\nConsider FivePoint Holdings\u2019 Hunters Point Shipyard and Candlestick Point developments. More than 10,000 homes were approved for construction in 2010, but environmental hazards and other setbacks have kept the projects in limbo. The following year, Parkmerced was approved for 5,600 new units, but construction was pushed continually before falling by the wayside entirely during the pandemic.\nA mixed-use project was set to rise at 655 Fourth Street in South of Market in 2020 but was revised and approved in 2023 for 1,110 housing units, plus office space. Like other major developments in SoMa, that project has yet to get off the ground. Nearby, other projects like\n88 Bluxome\nand the\nSan Francisco Flower Mart\nare seeking plan revisions that could include an increased focus on housing as office demand in the city claws back from pandemic lows.\nUCSF\u2019s Power Station development\nConstruction at the Power Station mixed-use development in Dogpatch is about to take a big jump forward.\nAssociate Capital and the University of California, San Francisco\nwill start construction\nnext week on an eight-story, 300,000-square-foot cancer center that will provide proton therapy and other health services to patients. UCSF bought the 50,000-square-foot parcel from Associate Capital in the spring for $75 million.\nConstruction will be funded in part by up to $575 million in tax-exempt, fixed-rate revenue bonds from the\nCalifornia Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank\n. Costs are estimated to be about $400 million.\nThe first tranche of housing at the Power Station development, the 105-unit Sophie Maxwell affordable housing project, is slated for delivery in October. Up to 2,600 homes and 1.6 million square feet of space are approved for the site.\nMadison Capital\u2019s swing for crypto HQ\nMadison Capital\nis making a play on one the largest cryptocurrency headquarters in San Francisco.\nThe New York-based investment firm bought a loan from Affinius Capital backed by 600 Battery Street, a 125,000-square-foot building near Jackson Square currently serving as the corporate home of crypto company Ripple. The sale price of the loan hasn\u2019t been disclosed, though Madison is thought to have spent more than $80 million,\naccording\nto the San Francisco Business Times.\n\nAffinius predecessor Square Mile Capital originated a $106.2 million loan for the property in 2019 when TMG Partners and Invesco acquired the building for about $115 million, or $920 per square foot.\nRipple planted its flag at 600 Battery in 2022 when it leased the whole three-story building for its headquarters. It will stay in its space at the site.\nWith Madison now owning the building\u2019s debt, it could be well positioned to buy the building outright.\nSan Jose\u2019s ADU condo sale\nFor the first time ever in California, homeowners can sell accessory dwelling units as standalone condos.\nThe city of San Jose\napproved a backyard ADU\non Jos\u00e9fa Street near downtown to be sold as a condominium, utilizing Assembly Bill 1033 to make the sale happen. AB 1033 became state law last year, and San Jose was the first large city in the state to adopt the law last July.\nMayor Matt Mahan called the sale a \u201cproof of concept for California.\u201d\nThe ADU was developed by Bay Area real estate firm AlphaX RE Capital. San Jose has permitted 1,500 ADUs since 2022 and issued final building permits for more than 1,110.\nCarmel Highlands price record\nA\nmansion in Carmel Highlands\nfeatured on film and television is listed for an eye-popping price.\nThe estate at 157-163 Spindrift Road is asking $91.2 million \u2014 $7,600 per square foot and more than double the record for the most-expensive sale in Monterey County. A $45 million\nhome in Pebble Beach\nset the bar last year.\nThe property was featured in the 1992 thriller \u201cBasic Instinct\u201d as well as an episode of the HBO series \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d which was set in the nearby seaside enclave of Monterey.\nThe property consists of five parcels spanning 5.4 acres and six houses, including a 12,000-square-foot main house, four cottages and a new one-bedroom abode. Colorado-based software entrepreneur Gary Vickers and his wife Kerry Vickers are the sellers of the property that once belonged to world record-holding aviator Steve Fossett.\n",

He was working closely with two of his adult children, Joseph and Camilla, at the family firm.\nKodsi\u2019s brother, condo developer Dan Kodsi, will work with Camilla to complete the 45-unit building at 3034 Oak Avenue, just north of the neighborhood\u2019s downtown, Dan tells me. Arbor has secured contracts for more than 60 percent of the building. Remaining units start at $1.7 million. Sandra Masis from Cervera Real Estate has been handling sales.\nDan says he will ensure the project is completed but that Camilla will take the lead and continue her father\u2019s legacy.\n\u201cShe\u2019s got a great grip on what\u2019s happening on the property,\u201d he says. \u201cFor someone who doesn\u2019t have that level of experience, she\u2019s doing a great job.\u201d\nIsaac lived nearby in Coconut Grove with his wife, Teresita, and their children.\nDan says that while the residential market has been slow, Arbor is priced slightly lower than other buildings in the area, giving it an advantage. The building is expected to receive its temporary certificate of occupancy by the end of the year.\nIt will mark the long-awaited next chapter for Arbor. The previous developer, a partnership led by Nick Hamann and Jeremy Waks, launched sales at Arbor in 2017 and planned to deliver the building in 2019. Completion was delayed before the pandemic.\nCamilla Kodsi wrote in a statement that completing the project, alongside her brother and uncle, \u201cis deeply personal for me.\u201d\nIsaac bought the property out of foreclosure, returned buyers\u2019 deposits and paid the general contractor and subcontractors who were owed money. Had the lender foreclosed on the site, the buyers likely would not have received their deposits back, he told me in 2023.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nI\u2019m working on a story about the state of the Brickell condo market, focusing on new developments in the pipeline. What are you hearing? Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\nCLOSING TIME\n\nResidential\n: Billionaire Russell Weiner\npaid $35.3 million\nfor the waterfront mansion at 43 Star Island Drive in Miami Beach. The late Dr. David Frankel, a prominent dermatologist, owned the 11,104-square foot, eight-bedroom mansion with his wife, Linda Frankel. Weiner plans to renovate and expand the home, eventually listing it for sale for more than $100 million.\nCommercial\n: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\u2019 real estate investment arm, Property Reserve, paid $152.5 million for a 384-unit building known as Del Ola at 7801 North Federal Highway in Boca Raton. Clarion Partners sold the apartment building.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nThe 14,321-square-foot, seven-bedroom estate at 2315 South Ocean Boulevard in Palm Beach hit the market for $73 million. The 1.8-acre property, with two pools, a theater, gym, guest quarters and more, is listed with Gary Pohrer of Serhant and Nick Malinosky of Douglas Elliman. It previously\ntraded in 2022\nfor $44.9 million.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\nWeiner, the billionaire founder of Rockstar Energy Drink, is the real owner of the waterfront home at 5300 North Bay Road in Miami Beach. He\u2019s been assembling a portfolio of ultra-luxury waterfront properties in the city in recent years.\nElsewhere in Florida\nA federal judge ordered the state to stop accepting new detainees at \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d and dismantle infrastructure added to the former airport site in the Florida Everglades. The ruling stems from a lawsuit by environmental groups and a Native American tribe over the detention center\u2019s effects on the ecosystem,\nCNN\nreports. The state is appealing the ruling.\nSiemens Energy signed a 242,000-square-foot office relocation lease in Lake Nona, marking the largest office lease in Orlando since 2009 and one of the top three ever recorded in the city, according to a press release.

What about an office-to-hotel conversion?\nKensico Properties proposed converting 509 Madison Avenue in Midtown from a 21-story office to a 30-story hotel with ground-floor retail space, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Nabil Chartouni\u2019s firm filed a rezoning application with the Department of City Planning.\nThe conversion plans call for 96 hotel rooms, as well as a lobby and amenity spaces, all stretching across 139,000 square feet. The retail space would occupy 3,300 square space and have separate frontage from the hotel.\nA decade ago, it wasn\u2019t even clear if Kensico would be holding on to the property. In 2017, it\nput its leasehold of the office property on the market\n, despite high occupancy rates remaining strong. The leasehold never sold.\nTenants at the building today include investment firm Banyan Tree Capital Management, private equity firm Yellowstone Capital Partners and Kensico itself, all of which would likely be displaced by a conversion that doesn\u2019t appear to leave any office space behind.\nNone of the relevant players commented to the outlet about the application. Should the conversion take place, the hotel would be competing with the likes of Omni Berkshire Place, Lotte New York Palace and Hotel Elysee in the neighborhood.\n\nNew York City\u2019s hotel market is\noutperforming\nthe rest of the sector nationally in a number of key metrics, including average weekly occupancy rate \u2014 82 percent in the first half of the year, according to CoStar \u2014 and revenue per available room in the city per night, which averaged $238.93 a week.\nThe city\u2019s hotel owners are benefitting from a pair of critical legislative changes in recent years.\nA 2021 City Council bill mandated a special permit for new hotel developments, essentially\nfreezing the sector\u2019s construction pipeline\n.\nTwo years ago, the city began cracking down on short-term rentals, blocking platforms from processing payments to hosts that were either unregistered with the city or didn\u2019t have approval to rent their properties for fewer than 30 days.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Brookfield Properties is facing a foreclosure push at one of its Downtown Brooklyn office buildings, where Rialto Capital Management alleged a $132.7 million loan default.\nRialto, acting as special servicer, filed a pre-foreclosure complaint on Aug. 21 in New York State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, according to\nPincusCo\n. The loan, originated in 2013 at $170 million and securitized into a Morgan Stanley Bank of America Merrill Lynch CMBS trust, matured in September 2023. The borrower, Forest City Myrtle Associates \u2014 controlled by Brookfield \u2014 allegedly failed to pay off the balance at maturity.\nRialto claims at least $132.7 million remains due, a total that doesn\u2019t include reserves but factors in principal, interest and default interest. The loan is secured by 115 Myrtle Avenue, a 692,000-square-foot office building formerly known as 15 MetroTech Center. The property is part of the Brooklyn Commons campus, which Brookfield\nrebranded\nin 2022 after acquiring Forest City Realty Trust in 2018.\nBrookfield invested in upgrades to the property after its acquisition, with reports of renovations underway in 2021. Records show the building generated $25.9 million in revenue in the most recent year, about $37 per square foot, roughly in line with its assessed market value of $132.7 million.\nFor Brookfield, the foreclosure threat comes as its New York portfolio remains heavily weighted toward office \u2014 58 percent of its holdings \u2014 with $13.8 billion in debt across city properties.\n\nThe firm isn\u2019t alone in facing maturing CMBS debt with limited refinancing options, but a foreclosure fight in Brooklyn highlights the growing risks for landlords outside Manhattan\u2019s core.\nRepresentatives for Brookfield and Rialto did not immediately respond to requests for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nRialto\u2019s aggressive tactics have proven\nnewsworthy\nin recent months. Citywide, property owners and court records show Rialto waging war against Signature Bank borrowers, creating defaults on deals in good standing by ignoring borrowers\u2019 notices to exercise loan extensions and then suing to foreclose.\nRialto has said it is following the rules and has only enforced its rights and remedies in \u201crare instances\u201d in which sponsors defaulted and failed to communicate.

The total was on par with the\nprevious period\n, which logged 23 pending deals.\nStreisand paid $420,000 for the 9,200-square-foot home in 1970. The five-story, 25-foot-wide property hit the market last June asking $18 million.\nThe Art Deco-style townhouse, built in 1930, has eight bedrooms, five bathrooms, a landscaped garden and three terraces. It also features an elevator and six wood-burning fireplaces.\nCorcoran\u2019s Cathy Franklin and Alexis Bodenheimer had the listing.\nThe second most expensive home to find a buyer was a co-op in Carnegie Hill, with an asking price just under $13 million. The pending deal price was down significantly from its last sale price of\n$16.5 million\nwhen retired advertising executive Dick Tarlow and his wife, Kristin Kehrberg, bought it roughly nine years ago.\n\nThe 19th-floor apartment at 1050 Fifth Avenue was once two separate units, which were combined and renovated in 2011. It hit the market last March asking $17 million, and though it spent more than a year searching for a new owner, the signed contract came after a bidding war.\nThe home spans 4,000 square feet and has four bedrooms and four bathrooms. It also features three terraces and views of Central Park.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Anne Easton had the listing.\nOf the 22 properties to find buyers, 17 were condos, three were co-ops and two were townhouses.\nThe homes\u2019 combined asking price was $151 million, for an average price of $6.9 million and a median of $5.6 million.

ZD Jaspser is aiming to build an 18-story property with 24 luxury condo units, ranging from two- to five-bedroom pads sprawled across 81,000 square feet. The pricing has yet to be determined.

        "content": "More than seven years of legal proceedings seeking damages for targeted, systemic overcharging for Section 8 tenants ended last week.\nPangea Properties was accused of systematically overcharging the Chicago Housing Authority for housing choice voucher tenants as alleged in a 2018 whistleblower lawsuit filed by a former employee of Pangea, Antoni Muhawi. The case was closed with a joint stipulation of dismissal, the Promote\nreported\n. Court records filed Aug. 18 show that unless the charges are reinstated in 30 days, the allegations are dismissed with prejudice. Any specific damages awarded to the federal government or Muhawi were not outlined in the court filings. Previously, Pangea denied committing fraud or systemic overcharging while admitting that there were some isolated cases of overcharging.\nWhistleblower complaints against Pangea\u2019s practices began a decade ago, when an investigator with CHA\u2019s Office of the Inspector General received a complaint from a voucher tenant, who was told when touring an apartment that the rent was $820 per month, according to internal emails filed as evidence in the lawsuit. But when she said she had a Section 8 voucher, Pangea told her the rent would be $970. Pangea had 1,130 units with Section 8 tenants at the time of the investigation.\nMuhawi\u2019s complaint alleged that Pangea had an \u201cestablished internal policy\u201d instructing property managers and leasing agents to quote new Section 8 tenants a monthly rent price $150 higher than the target rent for the unit, an amount that matched what the Section 8 renter told the CHA in her complaint.\n\nPangea was one of Chicago\u2019s largest landlords until it sold its portfolio of more than 400 buildings \u2014 amounting to 7,500 units \u2014 to New York-based\nEmerald Empire\nin 2022 for $600 million. It was one of the largest multifamily real estate deals in Chicago\u2019s history. The 2022 sale came after another lawsuit was filed against Pangea Properties. More than a dozen tenants accused the landlord of ignoring repeated requests for repairs, threatening their safety by deferring property maintenance.\nThe 153-page class-action\ncomplaint\nsaid Pangea racked up 5,000 reports of city violations since 2009, including no heat in the winter and rodent and insect infestations.\nEarlier this\nmonth\nThe Real Deal\nreported that Fannie Mae and Emerald entered a forbearance agreement on at least $125 million worth of loans associated with the purchase of Pangea\u2019s holdings.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The South Bay retail market had a tough second quarter.\nSilicon Valley retail vacancy increased, and asking rents dropped in April through June, compared to the previous three months, the Mercury News\nreported\n, citing Cushman &amp; Wakefield. The exit of several national retailers, such as\nBed Bath &amp; Beyond\nand Barnes &amp; Noble, was partially to blame.\nThe South Bay saw a retail vacancy rate of 5.2 percent in the second quarter, up from 4.7 percent in the first quarter, when vacancies hit a six-year low in the area. Retail rents fell from about $2.92 per square foot in the first quarter to $2.81 in the second.\nSome parts of Silicon Valley and the South Bay fared better than others. The retail vacancy rate in\nSunnyvale\nand\nCupertino\nwas 3.1 percent, while North San Jose and Milpitas were at 4.5 percent.\nPalo Alto\n, Mountain View and Los Altos had a 5.1 percent vacancy rate, while downtown San Jose, south San Jose, Los Gatos and Campbell registered a 5.4 percent retail vacancy. The markets in the area with the highest retail vacancy rates were Santa Clara with 5.5 percent and Morgan Hill and Gilroy at 7.5 percent.\n\nWhile the trend might raise some concerns, investors don\u2019t appear to be shaken and are looking toward the long term in the South Bay.\nLast December, Arc Capital Partners and Milan Capital Management bought The Plant shopping center in San Jose for $95 million, the Mercury News\nreported\n. After that purchase, a supermarket and discount store moved into spaces that had been empty and several new leases at the property were signed.\nElsewhere in the South Bay, retail centers have begun finding more tenants for previously vacant spaces. At Almaden Plaza in south San Jose, for example, the former homes of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and Barnes &amp; Noble have been filled by Hobby Lobby with a 62,000-square-foot lease and Sports Basement renting 86,000 square feet.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Billionaire Charles Cohen is eking out a little liquidity.\nVornado has entered an agreement to buy Cohen\u2019s Manhattan office tower at 623 Fifth Avenue for $218 million, the company announced Monday.\nA sale would help pay off Cohen\u2019s nearly $200 million judgement to Fortress Credit Corp. But the price was likely less than he was hoping for; The property was valued at nearly three times that amount, $640 million, in 2023, according to a financial statement filed with the court.\nCohen\u2019s fight with Fortress is a result of personally guaranteeing a $534 million loan portfolio. When the billionaire defaulted, Fortress waged war, going after the his personal assets. He lost the buildings backing the loans when Fortress took them in what was among\nthe largest UCC foreclosures of all time\n.\nThe lender scored a\n$187 million judgement\nin the case in March. With interest, that is now $194.4 million before legal fees, according to a letter from Fortress to the court.\nBut Cohen says he needs to sell his assets first. Fortress has accused him of dragging his feet, and is seeking to appoint a receiver for the buildings.\nCohen\u2019s lawyers, meanwhile, have said he\u2019s motivated to sell.\n\n\u201cFortress\u2019s aggressive pursuit of Mr. Cohen is doing nothing more than interfering with efforts to maximize the value of his assets and generate the most amount of liquidity to pay down the Judgment,\u201d his lawyers wrote to the court in June.\nBetween April and the end of June, Cohen\u2019s representatives met with five different buyers to discuss a sale of 623 Fifth, according to a letter from his lawyers to the judge. The letter from law firm Blank Rome to the court also describes a publicly traded REIT in talks to purchase the property \u2014 likely Vornado \u2014 alongside a hotel operator and two New York City developers.\nThe 36-story tower at 623 Fifth Avenue is more than 352,000 square feet and owned by a company that Cohen fully controls. He had intended to convert the building into residential units. As such, it\u2019s 75 percent vacant, according to the release from Vornado.\nThe Midtown-based real estate firm doesn\u2019t intend to move forward with the conversion, instead intending to redevelop the tower as a Class A office building. Vornado said it plans to close the deal next month and to finish the redevelopment in 2027.\nFortress declined to comment. Cohen Brothers Realty as well as Donald Harwood, an attorney for Cohen in the Fortress case with Harwood Reif LLC, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nAt least four of Cohen\u2019s properties are in foreclosure proceedings, including one that he intends to sell, 3 East 54th Street, according to a letter from Fortress to the court.\n",

Nearly a fifth of them would also be reserved specifically for formerly homeless individuals.\nThe 66,000-square-foot lot is largely vacant, zoned for light manufacturing use. The site, which Phipps wants to be altered to allow for medium-density residential use, is bound by Intervale Avenue, East 169th Street and Kelly Street.\nThe project would be anywhere from six to 12 stories tall and include nearly 6,000 square feet of community facility space. There would also be amenities, including two laundry rooms, a fitness room, a playroom, bicycle storage and a doorman.\nThe nonprofit did not respond to a request for comment from the outlet.\n\nPhipps has been involved in major residential developments in New York City before. A couple of years ago, it scored\na $225 million construction loan\nfor a 436-unit affordable housing complex on Euclid Avenue in Cypress Hills, Brooklyn.\nThe project represented one of three the nonprofit housing developer plotted between Fulton Street and Atlantic Avenue.\nDevelopment is springing up all over the South Bronx. Last month, Scale Lending provided\na $305 million loan\nto the Beitel Group for its 755-unit project at 355 Exterior Street.\nLast summer, Arian Liton filed plans for a 99-unit mixed-use project at 36 Bruckner Boulevard.

The site is in the Country Walk neighborhood, south of Miami Executive Airport.\nDevelopment of the project, called Tamiami Logistics Center, has started, Whitfield Hamilton, the firm\u2019s CEO, said in a news release. Construction is expected to be completed in the spring of next year, the release says.\nLast year, Hamilton filed an application for administrative site plan approval to Miami-Dade officials. The county approved the project this year, records show.\nThe development site is within a 9.5-acre property. Hamilton only purchased the portion of the property, including the 42,000-square-foot office building, where Hamilton will build Tamiami Logistics Center. The office building was completed in 1979.\nBaptist Health kept ownership of its emergency room on the property, records show.\n\nJose and Sebastian Juncadella are part of the Fairchild Partners team leasing Tamiami Logistics Center.\nWhitfield Hamilton founded his eponymously named firm in 2023 after a nearly two-decade career as regional partner at Irvine, California-based Panattoni Development Company. Former Panattoni executives Scott Abbott, Bill Hudgins, Jeff Konieczny and Hayne Hamilton also are founding partners of Hamilton.\nThe firm has projects underway in 12 markets in the Southeast and mid-Atlantic areas.\nAt Miami-Dade\u2019s Flagler Station business park, Hamilton plans three warehouses in place of the office buildings at 9675, 9725 and 10451 Northwest 117th Avenue, records show. The properties are in an unincorporated area of the county.\nIn May, Hamilton acquired the building at 10451 Northwest 117th Avenue from Bridge Investment Group through a deed-in lieu of foreclosure, and it paid\n$20.8 million\nfor the building at 9675 Northwest 117th Avenue. Hamilton also filed a $59.3 million foreclosure suit against Bridge Investment on the building at 9725 Northwest 117th Avenue, records show.\nSouth Florida suburban offices are getting\nredeveloped\ninto industrial and multifamily projects.

        "content": "A year after selling a Lincoln Park mansion for $35 million under asking, Richard and Michaela Parrillo downsized to a $6.5 million Gold Coast penthouse in July.\nThe couple bought the discounted 6,800-square-foot condo at 1300 North State Parkway for $956 per square foot. The two-story penthouse has five bedrooms and six bathrooms.\nThe buyers, United Automobile Insurance Company chairman and CEO Richard Parrillo and his wife made headlines when they set the record for the most expensive single-family home sale in Chicago with the sale of their\nLincoln Park mansion\nfor $15.25 million in August 2024. The home was initially listed for $50 million and sold at a steep loss.\nThe condo was sold under a land trust that obscures the sellers\u2019 identities. But documents from 2016 list the previous owners as Christian Zann and Amy Everard. Zann, the chief investment officer at Sourcerock Group, was an asset manager for Balyasny in Chicago until 2019.\n\nTimothy Salm of Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty represented the buyer in the deal, and he previously represented the Parrillos on the $15.25 million Lincoln Park deal. Rachel Krueger, also of Jameson Sotheby\u2019s, represented the seller. Salm declined to comment, and Krueger did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe condo last sold in August 2015 for $6.9 million. In October 2022, it went up for sale asking $8 million, about a 15 percent increase. But the home proved difficult to sell in the weaker downtown market. The listing was removed in August 2023 and put back up for sale in February 2024 with a $1 million price cut.\nThen in June 2024, it was listed for rent at $30,000 a month, but the listing was removed a month later.\nThe condo is a significant downsize from the 25,000-square-foot estate in Lincoln Park the Parrillos sold last year. The couple spent $65 million acquiring the land and building the six-bedroom, 11-bathroom house, Crains previously reported.\nThe Lincoln Park mansion\u2019s buyer was David Cocagne, CEO of Vermilion Development. Cocagne\u2019s Vermilion is\ndeveloping a 447-unit\n, 31-story apartment tower in Evanston, which would be the city\u2019s tallest building.",

        "content": "The yearslong fight over Pepper Square is over, and the developer came out on top.\nThe Save Pepper Square Neighborhood Association dropped its lawsuit against Dallas and developer Henry S. Miller Company, ending a high-profile zoning dispute that had stalled plans to redevelop the aging Far North Dallas shopping center, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nThe Dallas-based firm is moving ahead with a $200 million mixed-use project with 868 apartments on the 15.5-acre site near Preston and Belt Line roads. The maximum height was set to 165 feet by the Dallas City Council, and a minimum of 35,000 square feet of retail, office or other personal service business space must be set aside. Miller originally pushed for as many as 2,000 units at the site before negotiations with City Hall slashed the density.\nThe outcome underscores the sweeping impact of a new Texas law that could accelerate redevelopment of aging retail centers across Texas. For developers, it opens the door to higher-density plays on underperforming commercial sites. Set to take effect Sept. 1, the law requires cities to allow\nmixed-use residential\nand multifamily development in a zoning classification that allows office, retail or industrial development and applies to cities with more than 150,000 residents located in counties with more than 300,000 people.\n\nMatt Bach, who led the neighborhood opposition group, told the outlet that winning the lawsuit would have been a hollow victory once the law takes effect, prompting the organization to\ndrop\nthe case.\nThe developer expects to start construction by the end of next year, starting with a midrise fronting Belt Line Road and moving next to an eight-story building along Preston. Gregory Miller, president of Henry S. Miller Company, said the new law would let him pack in closer to 1,900 units, but market fundamentals make that unrealistic. The project\u2019s scale was cut substantially, as the originally proposed\n12-story tower\nand higher apartment number was scrapped.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Developer David Martin is now involved in Michael Stern\u2019s planned luxury condo tower in Miami Beach, sources told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nState records show that in late July,\nMartin\u2019s\nname and Terra\u2019s address were added to LLCs that are tied to the planned project. JDS Pulse, an anonymous blog that\nStern sued in May\n, first disclosed Terra\u2019s involvement.\nMartin\u2019s Coconut Grove-based Terra does have an interest in the deal to develop the condo project at 1250 West Avenue, a spokesperson for Terra confirmed.\nGianluca Vacchi\u2019s\nGV Development and RG Development are also partners in the project. A statement from JDS said that Terra is part of the development team for the project.\nThe developers did not disclose additional details.\nRecords show JDS and its partners have purchased at least two dozen condos at the building at 1250 West Avenue, which is home to the 15-story, circa-1964 Bay Garden Manor condos. It has 238 units. The developer\u2019s 1250 West Ave LLC has been in contract to acquire the remaining majority of units, and could close on them soon, according to sources.\n\nThe JDS-led LLC secured a\ncontentious approval this summer\nfrom the Miami Beach City Commission that will allow for a taller and slimmer tower on the bayfront West Avenue site, which is next to the Stern-developed Monad Terrace luxury condo project.\nThe new building at 1250 West Avenue can be up to 330 feet tall, more than double what was allowed as of right. But a reduction in density brings the maximum number of condos down to 125 units from the 286 allowed by right.\nThe JDS-led venture will redevelop the Bikini Hostel property across the street at 1247 West Avenue as part of a public benefits package it\u2019s providing to the city. The developer has been in contract to buy the property for months. Stern declined to disclose the purchase price at a recent commission meeting.\nThe commission granted final approvals to the development agreement and zoning amendments at a special meeting in late June, where Martin also secured an upzoning for the\nDeauville Beach Resort\nproperty. Martin is a 25 percent owner of that property; the controversial Meruelo family holds the majority interest.\nMartin has a history of involving himself in tricky deals, including the Deauville project. He was working on a bulk purchase of the Castle Beach Club property, an aging condo building in Miami Beach, but that\ndeal expired early last year.\nDevelopers have been increasingly joining forces with their competitors, bringing on additional equity partners or forming a joint venture partnership with other developers as they deal with rising costs. Earlier this year, Martin partnered with Edgardo Defortuna\u2019s Fortune International Group to pay a\nrecord $205 million\nfor a Key Biscayne development site where they plan a 56-unit ultra-luxury condo building.\n",

        "content": "After a post-primary spike in donations from real estate executives, Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 campaign saw contributions from the industry level off.\nReal estate donors gave Adams a little more than $60,500 between July 12 and August 18, according to the latest filings with the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board. That\u2019s down considerably from the more than $480,000 he received from the industry between June 25 and July 11, following former Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s defeat in the Democratic primary.\nThe sudden boost from the industry was\nseen\nas an early sign that real estate professionals \u2014\u00a0who had rallied behind Cuomo\u2019s campaign leading up to the primary \u2014\u00a0were shifting support to the mayor\u2019s re-election bid.\nBut over the last month, Adams, who is running as an independent, has ranked fourth in multiple\npolls\n, trailing behind Assembly member and Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, Cuomo and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa. Though he escaped federal corruption charges himself, allegations have continued to plague his inner circle. Last week, current and former members of his administration were\nindicted\non charges related to speeding up construction approvals and steering contracts to certain developers.\nThe real estate contributions during the latest filing period \u2014 based on donors who self-reported working within various sectors of the industry \u2014 represent roughly 14 percent of the total $425,000 Adams brought in over the last month. During the previous filing period, he received $1.5 million in total donations.\nTodd Shapiro, a spokesperson for the Adams campaign, brushed off any suggestion that the latest donations indicate waning enthusiasm among industry players. He pointed to a number of fundraisers held by real estate executives after the primary.\nSL Green Realty\u2019s Marc Holliday hosted a fundraiser for Adams in July, and employees of the real estate investment trust\ndonated\nmore than $67,000 to the mayor\u2019s re-election period after the primary. Shapiro noted that the donations and fundraisers happen at different times, and looking at one filing period fails to account for big-picture support from the industry.\n\u201cThe real estate industry wholeheartedly supports Mayor Eric Adams,\u201d he said.\nBefore news of the indictments, as well as\nreports\nthat one of his campaign advisors handed a reporter a potato chip bag stuffed with cash, real estate executives gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to Empower NYC, a super PAC backing Adams.\nAn LLC tied to Two Trees Management gave the super PAC $100,000 on August 11. GFP Real Estate\u2019s Jeff Gural contributed $25,000 on August 15. In an email, Gural said he still thinks Adams is the best choice, but acknowledged that the \u201clatest batch of arrests make it much harder for that to happen.\u201d He doesn\u2019t, however, intend to support another candidate.\nDeveloper Gary Barnett gave the PAC $250,000 on July 2, and billionaire Alexander Rovt donated $15,000 on June 6. Officials paused a city office lease at Rovt\u2019s 14 Wall Street in November amid questions of whether the property got special treatment because of Rovt\u2019s previous support of Adams. The administration ultimately allowed the lease to\nmove\nforward.\n\nThose who gave the Adams campaign the maximum $2,100 include Tao Group Hospitality co-CEOs Noah Tepperberg and Jason Strauss, based out of Manhattan and Las Vegas, respectively; Harry Bajraktari, whose eponymous Bronx firm owns and manages more than 70 buildings; Corcoran broker Dana Power; Nest Seekers broker Andy Kim; Adam Falk, a principal and co-portfolio manager at BH3 Management in Manhattan; Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s Gil Gideon; and Broadway Construction Group\u2019s Joseph Aiello.\nLandlord Paul Gjonaj gave $1,000, while his brother, former Bronx Council member Mark Gjonaj, also an owner and property manager, gave $500. The former Council member, who had been subject to a\nprobe\nrelated to government contracts awarded to campaign donors (no charges or discipline were ever announced), dropped his bid for re-election in 2021, telling City &amp; State that the \u201ccurrent political climate is not favorable to a centrist ideology.\u201d\nCuomo\u2019s donations from the industry have bounced back since the last filing period. Over the last month, he brought in a little more than $53,700 from the real estate industry. After the primary through July 11, he only received $2,115 in total, with a $25 donation from one real estate agent (at the time, Cuomo\u2019s team indicated that the campaign had stopped fundraising after maxing out on donations ahead of the primary).\nRFR Realty\u2019s Charles and Gabriel Rosen each gave $2,100 in August. Others who gave the maximum amount to Cuomo during this filing period include Icon Realty Management\u2019s Todd Cohen, CBRE\u2019s Ken Meyerson, Florida developer Peter Brock and Rob Vecsler, CEO of Hyperion Group, a development firm based in Manhattan and Miami.\nBetween July 12 and August 18, the Cuomo campaign reported receiving just over $472,500 in donations. The campaign also transferred\n$68,000 from a state account\n.\nThe super PAC, Fix the City, received millions of dollars from industry donors in the lead-up to the primary. The PAC has indicated that it will still support Cuomo in the general election, but it hasn\u2019t received many contributions from real estate donors since the June primary. Equity Residential gave it $10,000 earlier this month.\nMeanwhile, Mamdani reported taking in more than $1 million during this period. Though many in the industry have been critical of Mamdani\u2019s policies,\nsome have donated\nto his campaign. They tend, however, to be nonprofit or affordable developers or otherwise smaller industry players.\nOne developer who donated to Mamdani explained that his support was a product simply of Mamdani being the Democratic nominee, and that the developer\u2019s kids are roughly the same age as the Assembly member and are supporting him.\nMamdani\u2019s latest filings indicate that roughly $19,700 came from real estate-related donors. That included a $2,100 contribution from Obaid Khan, chief financial officer at Tishman Realty.\nOver the last month, Sliwa raised roughly $406,400, with more than $9,000 coming from real estate donors. Attorney Jim Walden, who is running as an independent, received a total of $8,200 over the last month and reported some small donations from construction professionals.\n",

        "content": "Thrive Living\u2019s affordable housing development in East Hollywood is moving forward with the help of a $65 million construction loan.\nThe Los Angeles-based developer, an affiliate of New York-based Magnum Real Estate Group, secured the loan from J.P. Morgan for a seven-story building at 1141 North Vermont Avenue, Urbanize Los Angeles\nreported\n.\nThe development will feature 290 studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom units for residents making up to 80 percent of the area median income. In Los Angeles County, this is\ndefined\nas a maximum annual income of $84,850 for one person or $121,450 for a household of four.\nTo bring the 1141 Vermont development to life, Thrive Living will use prefabricated modular units, thus allowing for a speedier construction timeline. Work on the site could be completed within 14 months, according to Urbanize. The property will feature amenities like a rooftop deck, a community room and various landscaped outdoor spaces.\nAnother modular Thrive Living project, a 376-unit development at 1457 North Main Street in Chinatown, also benefited from a J.P. Morgan construction loan, per Urbanize. By using modular construction there, Thrive\nexpects\nto cut costs by 15 percent.\n\nThe area near the Vermont/Santa Monica Metro station, where the 1141 Vermont development will rise, is in the midst of a transformation as other affordable housing projects get underway nearby.\nOutside the train station entrance, Little Tokyo Service Center built a 187-unit affordable housing complex, while one block to the east, Jamison Properties is similarly building a 177-unit mixed-income development.\nPrefabricated modular projects such as Thrive Living\u2019s latest East Hollywood endeavor are proving to be beneficial in the Los Angeles area for both single-family and multifamily developments.\nIn the wake of January\u2019s deadly wildfires, some homeowners in the Eaton and Palisades burn zones have turned to\nprefabricated models\nto erect\ntemporary housing\non their property. As Altadena, the Pacific Palisades, Malibu and other surrounding areas emerge from the ashes, modular housing could end up being a boon for these homeowners .\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "How much did Waterton pay for the Warner Center?\nIt shelled out $167.4 million for the Woodland Hills apartment complex, property records reveal.\nWaterton\npurchased\nthe 522 apartments from AMLI Residential last month, but a price was not disclosed.\nAMLI Residential developed the property almost two decades ago. The complex at 21200 Kittridge Street is now called The Kitt at Warner Center and boasts a resort-inspired pool and spa, al fresco dining and an outdoor fireplace. The value-add, Chicago-based investor plans to renovate the one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments and revamp common areas.\n\n\u201cWhat made it attractive was primarily the value-add upside. The vast majority of units are in either original condition from 2007 or have been partially upgraded over the years. The common areas and amenities can be reconfigured and improved,\u201d Kol Rath, vice president of acquisitions at Waterton, said when the deal was announced. The company, founded and helmed by David Schwartz, owns thousands of apartments in Los Angeles.\nThe Kitt at Warner Center is within a master-planned community, the Warner Center, where the billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Rams, Stanley Kroenke, has proposed a $10 billion\ndevelopment\n.\nWoodland Hills has a 4.3 percent multifamily vacancy rate, and commands $2,788 average rent per apartment, according to a second-quarter CBRE market\nreport\n. That\u2019s on par with typical vacancies and rents throughout the Los Angeles market. The highest multifamily sale price for that period was $126 million for a 235-unit apartment building in Glendale, according to the report.\nWaterton has been pretty active, on the buy and sell side. The company recently began\nmarketing\ntwo 14-story apartment buildings in Chicago. Waterton paid about $82 million for the complex, called Grand Central, two years earlier. In another deal, last year Waterton\npurchased\na San Francisco complex encompassing seven six-story buildings from Brookfield for $177.5 million.\nAMLI last summer\nsold\na 325-unit apartment complex for around $89 million in South Florida.",

        "content": "Dry Creek Capital is getting in position to gain a second foothold in the office market with distressed debt deals surrounding Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International Airport.\nThe Denver-based firm acquired the loan note for the $47.3 million non-performing mortgage tied to the O\u2019Hare International Center, a two-building, 530,000-square-foot property at 10255 and 10275 Higgins Road in Rosemont, Steve Emerson of Dry Creek confirmed. The property is owned by Utah-based Bridge Investment Group\nThe loan note traded for about $26.5 million, according to a person familiar with the deal. Emerson declined to discuss the price. But a transaction for that amount would have dealt a blow to Alabama-based lender Regions Bank, which originated a $50 million mortgage loan to Bridge in 2018 for the landlord\u2019s $64 million purchase of the property. Bridge poured another $8 million into improvements during its ownership, meaning the landlord is feeling some financial pain as the property\u2019s value is likely well below its investment.\nThe deal sets Dry Creek up to seize the property from Bridge, though Emerson said the path forward is still being discussed between the companies. The asset is 76 percent leased, according to JLL.\nThis is the buyer\u2019s second distressed debt acquisition in the O\u2019Hare office market. Dry Creek seized the 210,000-square-foot building at 25 Northwest Point Boulevard in Elk Grove Village earlier this summer from a venture of Michigan-based landlord Farbman Group.\nIt may not be Dry Creek\u2019s last deal in the area, either, though it has recently been active in the Washington, D.C., region, Emerson said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a ton of dry powder,\u201d he said. \u201cWe mainly purchase loans from banks.\u201d\nBridge and Farbman are far from the only victims of the downturn for suburban Chicago office properties. The sector is rough for landlords, as vacancy is hovering near record highs of over 30 percent on average, with demand from tenants shrinking as companies cut space while remote and hybrid work schedules linger and interest rates are elevated. Landlords are being forced to offer steep concessions just to attract or keep tenants.\nOn top of that, landlords are skittish about sinking more money into their properties when leasing absorption has been negative for years, leaving a lot of suburban offices stuck in limbo.\nDry Creek stripped Farbman of the Northwest Point property two years after buying the loan note for the building, which took its second consecutive nosedive in value as the former landlord\u2019s loan came due, Cook County property records show. Farbman bought the property for just under $20 million in 2013 from a John Buck Company venture that had bought it in 2007 for $31.5 million. Farbman used a $16 million mortgage loan from KeyBank to finance its acquisition, and distressed debt specialist Dry Creek acquired the note in 2023.\nJLL\u2019s Tom Hall, Kyle Kaminski, Pat Shields and Sam DiFrancesca marketed the O\u2019Hare International Center loan for sale.\n",

        "content": "Boutique office properties are drawing the attention of real estate firms looking for big discounts on well-positioned buildings.\nThat\u2019s the case with a deal inked last week by Chicago-based Cubed Real Estate and developer R2, who jointly paid just shy of $5 million for a River North loft office building, which the lender had seized a year prior, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. That puts the price at about $95 per square foot. The six-story, 52,500-square-foot building at 225 West Ohio Street was sold well below its going price a decade earlier of $13.3 million. Green Bay-based lender Associated Bank seized the property last year to resolve an outstanding loan on the building.\nAssociated took over the deed in a foreclosure from Dallas-based Transwestern Investment Group last summer. Transwestern refinanced the property in 2020 with a $9.4 million mortgage from Associated. Transwestern paid down the loan balance by $2.7 million, buying an extension beyond the original maturity date in 2023, but eventually the lender seized it.\nThe discounted price reflects the struggle office buildings have faced across the country post-pandemic, as high interest rates and work-from-home policies became the norm.\n\nCubed and R2 are betting on discounted offices increasing in value amid the trend of converting larger office towers into residential, removing some competition, Cubed principal Eric Weber told the outlet.\nThe River North building is 78 percent leased, and the buyers plan to lease it up. The largest tenant in the building is engineering and landscape design firm Terra Engineering. R2 has been testing investor interest in net-leased properties, which are characterized by a single long-term tenant covering most operational costs.\nThe purchase follows a\ntrend\nfor R2, which purchased another six-story building in\nRiver North\nearlier in August.The 70,000-square-foot\noffice\nproperty at 303 West Erie Street sold for $7.5 million, and it followed a similar steep discount pattern. The seller, New York-based Alvarez &amp; Marsal Property Investments, paid double that for the building in 2017.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Glencoe officials are debating how far the village should go to preserve its historic housing stock, as teardown pressure chips away at the North Shore suburb\u2019s architectural legacy.\nThe Preservation Commission pitched a package of new incentives, from tax rebates to permit fee discounts, aimed at encouraging owners to landmark their properties, the Record North Shore\nreported\n. But trustees balked at the potential price tag, questioning whether the village should shoulder the cost of keeping older homes intact.\nGlencoe designates homes in three categories: \u201ccertified landmarks,\u201d which carry strict protections and qualify for state and local incentives; \u201chonorary landmarks,\u201d subject only to demolition delays and advisory reviews; and \u201chistorically significant\u201d homes, which come with no regulatory teeth. Since 2013, when the state limited tax benefits to certified landmarks only, honorary designations have plummeted \u2014 and demolitions have picked up. Just three homes have received honorary status in the past 12 years, compared with 92 between 1990 and 2013. Eight honorary landmarks have been torn down since 2013, nearly matching the 13 lost over the prior two decades.\nIn an effort to reverse the trend, the commission proposed giving certified landmark owners rebates of up to 90 percent on building permit fees and $2,000 annual property tax breaks for eight years. Honorary landmarks would qualify for 50 percent fee rebates. Both programs would be capped annually to control village costs.\n\nThe group also asked trustees to consider zoning incentives, such as flexible setbacks and height allowances, as a lower-cost way to make preservation more appealing. Other recommendations included doubling demolition delays to 360 days and requiring owners to consent to honorary designations. The Village Board asked staff for more detail and is set to revisit the issue at its Sept. 18 meeting.\nThe question of preservation versus development is also being put to the test in other high-end\nChicagoland\nsuburbs. Last year, buyers in Winnetka wanted to tear down a $12.3 million historic mansion known as the\nClement Stone Mansio\nn, at 445 Sheridan Road, a Spanish revival built in 1912. And after rolling out an anti-teardown incentives package in\nHinsdale\nthree years ago, that town\u2019s Historic Preservation Commission changed the minds of the buyers of a 1930s colonial mansion set to be demolished.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A month\u2019s worth of political donations isn\u2019t the definitive record of who the real estate industry is supporting in the mayoral race.\nIt is, however, a pulse check. Leading up to the primary, the big industry players were overwhelmingly donating to former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. That changed after he lost, and then Mayor Eric Adams saw a sudden surge in industry donations. He brought in more than $489,000 from real estate donors after the primary, up through July 11.\nNow we have the latest donations, received between July 12 through August 18:\nZohran Mamdani\nReal estate donations: $19,720\nTotal contributions reported this period: $1 million\nEric Adams\nReal estate donations: $60,545\nTotal contributions reported this period: $425,181\nAndrew Cuomo\nReal estate donations: $53,720\nTotal contributions reported this period: $472,537 (plus a $68,225 transfer from a state fund)\nCurtis Sliwa\nReal estate donations: $9,939\nTotal contributions reported this period: $406,392\nJim Walden\n\nReal estate donations: $250\nTotal contributions reported this period: $8,222\nThe bottom line? The industry is still by and large supporting Adams and Cuomo. Donations to the mayor have slowed since the last filing period, but that seemed to be driven by an immediate (panicked) reaction to Cuomo\u2019s primary loss.\nThe next filing deadline is Oct. 3, at which point we should have a better sense of whether the industry is deciding to pull back further on its spending ahead of the general election. Of course, if someone drops out, everything could change.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill anyone drop out of the mayoral race before the general election? Have you heard anything about the land use ballot questions lately? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nThe term synanthrope (undomesticated creatures that live in close proximity to humans, such as rats, pigeons or squirrels) comes from the Greek \u201csyn,\u201d meaning \u201ctogether with\u201d and anthropos, which is \u201cman,\u201d according to the book \u201cThe 99% Invisible City: A Field Guide to The Hidden World of Everyday Design.\u201d\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 former chief advisor, Ingrid Lewis-Martin, was indicted last week on charges that she accepted kickbacks, including a brief cameo on the TV show \u201cGodfather of Harlem\u201d, in exchange for interfering with a controversial traffic redesign. But she isn\u2019t the only member of the mayor\u2019s inner circle to get a gig with the show.\nGothamist\nreported that Adams\u2019 son, Jordan Coleman, acted as personal assistant to actor Forest Whitaker during the show\u2019s second season, in what was described by two production employees as a \u201cpolitical hire.\u201d\n\u2014 Gothamist\nprofiled\nDrew Warshaw, who is emerging as a challenger to state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli. Warshaw\u2019s platform focused on the affordability crisis. As part of his campaign, he wants to invest $10 billion of the state pension fund into affordable housing projects.\n\u2014 Zohran Mamdani\u2019s campaign held a scavenger hunt over the weekend,\nNewsweek\nreported. The activity dovetailed with the mayoral candidate\u2019s campaign promise of fast, free buses, as participants used public transit to cross the city to various stops, several of them transit-themed. \u2014\nQuinn Waller\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was for a condominium unit at 63 West 17th Street for\n$7.8 million\n. The unit at The Lyla Condominium is 4,100 square feet and listed by\nCompass\u2019\nThe Davis Team.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$5.4 million\nfor 856 Greene Avenue. The Bedford-Stuyvesant rental building is three stories, has six units and is 5,800 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $7 million for a penthouse unit at 545 West 110th Street. The Morningside Heights condo is 3,100 square feet.\nCompass\u2019\nDeirdre De Risi and Marissa Galletti have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for a proposed 222,596-square-foot, six-story school building at 153-10 Hillside Avenue in Queens. Carrie Moore of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill is the applicant of record.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

That\u2019s $2,266 per square foot. The venture capitalist\nlisted the property\nat 164 Elena Avenue for more than $33 million last year. The buyer\u2019s identity hasn\u2019t been disclosed.\nAndreessen paid $16.6 million for the home in 2007. The cofounder of the Andreessen Horowitz venture capital firm and early web browsers Mosaic and Netscape moved in the year after marrying Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen, daughter of billionaire developer John Arrillaga who helped build up Silicon Valley into the tech hub it is today.\nThe main house boasts two kitchens, seven fireplaces and media entertainment options via \u201cvisible and concealed screens,\u201d according to the listing.\n\nBesides the main home, the property also has a one-bedroom guest house, a detached studio and a four-car garage partially converted into an office space. The home has a reflecting pool, fountains and a pergola; however, there\u2019s no swimming pool or sports court.\nAndreessen dropped more than $250 million on three properties in Malibu in 2021 and 2022. He, along with basketball power couple Steph and Ayesha Curry, objected to Atherton city officials adding density to the town at that time.\nAtherton has become a go-to escape for Silicon Valley\u2019s tech titans over the past decade. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and former Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg have planted flags in the town over the years. Schmidt\noffloaded\nhis Atherton property last year and\nspent $24 million\non a three-bedroom apartment in San Francisco\u2019s swanky Pacific Heights neighborhood.\nAndreessen\u2019s Atherton home sale price represents about half of the year\u2019s priciest sale in the Peninsula town.

The sale price of the 6,400-square-foot property isn\u2019t available, but it was asking $5 million when it sold after 101 days on the market, about $777 per square foot and $1 million higher than its last tax appraisal.\nThe listing agent, Eklund Gomes\u2019 Jeff Burke, didn\u2019t mince words in the listing summary: This single-family home is a business. The Bouldin Compound, as it\u2019s known on Vrbo, is projected to generate $700,000 in revenue this year as a short-term rental. (It\u2019s booked already for Labor Day weekend.) Catering to corporate retreats, the property managers have planned a conference area among other renovations. They\u2019re also \u201cactively working to build partnerships with major events like SXSW, ACL, F1 and the BLAST.tv Major, one of the world\u2019s largest e-sports tournaments,\u201d according to the listing.\n\nThe Bouldin Creek neighborhood is just across the river from downtown Austin and the Rainey Street Historic District, a nightlife hotspot.\nThe property has changed hands three times since it was built in 2018, and every owner after the original \u2014 a couple named Samuel and Lucia Ruiz \u2014 has been a business. The seller, an LLC registered to Adam Coleman, acquired the property last summer. Travis County hasn\u2019t published records relating to the sale yet.\nThe Bouldin Compound shouldered a West Austin new build to second place in the city\u2019s most-expensive residential sales last month. A five-bedroom mansion on 0.62 acres at 1604 Barclay Drive was asking $3.9 million when it sold last week.\n",

        "content": "The developers of a $1 billion project in Leander were dealt another setback by the Austin suburb.\nAustin-based iLand Development Group\u2019s updated plans for the 78-acre Leander Springs project was denied by the Leander City Council last week, Austin Business Journal\nreported\n. The unanimous vote denied amendments to its public utility district agreement with the city, further delaying any dirt moving on the ambitious mixed-use project centered around a 4-acre artificial lagoon, which was first announced five years ago.\nThe developer requested amendments to reduce the required number of apartments from 1,600 to 1,200, as well as some changes to the timeline. It asked for removal of the date required for certificate of completion on the lagoon, and to remove the time requirement for hotel construction and delivery. The PUD requires the hotel to be complete by the end of 2028.\nThe amendment also would\u2019ve removed the requirement that the Lagoon be open to the public, with admission offered at a discount to Leander residents.\nKey sticking points in moving the development forward have been water usage, stakeholder investment, a terminated\n$22 million\ncity incentive package \u2014 lost by tapping the federal EB-5 program, which trades permanent resident status to foreign investors and their families in exchange for investment in commercial enterprises. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality\u2019s website lists a permit application for an entity tied to the project to discharge up an average of 1.4 million gallons of treated effluent and stormwater per day. Leander Mayor Christine DeLisle has long been skeptical of the project due to concerns over water usage.\n\nAnother request in the PUD amendment was to designate the lagoon as a \u201cnon-essential use\u201d in terms of water so that it would have had to comply with conservation.\nAfter\u00a0 the Aug. 21 meeting, iLand said in a statement that the company is eager to move forward with the project, and that the water management plan presented to the City Council and residents is robust. iLand dropped Miami-based Crystal Lagoons as the lagoon developer, and Austin-based VVater has replaced it.\nThe setbacks don\u2019t stop with just water-use concerns for the project, at FM 2243 and the 183A frontage, intended to transform Leander into a\nCentral Texas\ndestination. Since announcing the project in 2020, iLand has faced setbacks that include $3 million in liens to contractors.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The leases bring the property\u2019s occupancy to 80 percent, according to a release from property owners Glenstar and Singerman Real Estate, which are based in Chicago.\nThe resi brokerage, which had a 17,000-square-foot office in Grapevine, will occupy 18,000 square feet on the first floor of the 278,000-square-foot Building 8 starting in September.\nIn addition, workforce development company Pluralsight moved its headquarters from Draper, Utah, to a 26,000-square-foot space in Building 6. Defense contractor M1 Support Services is shifting its headquarters from Denton to Building 5 of Terraces, where it inked a deal for 26,000 square feet of the 124,000-square-foot building.\nThe leasing momentum at the property follows a $25 million renovation completed in 2021. The campus now has 50,000 square feet of amenity space, including a restaurant, conference center, gym and covered parking.\n\nThe amenities sealed the deal for Century 21 Mike Bowman, said president Dave Bowman. Specifically, the brokerage will be able to host national events in the conference center.\nThese wins for the property speak to the strength of the office market in Dallas-Fort Worth suburbs. Companies are eager to locate closer to where employees live, in places like Westlake, which is an upscale suburb about 30 miles northwest of Dallas.\nHalfway through the year, JLL reported positive net absorption for the North Texas office market. It was highest in the second quarter in suburbs like Plano, McKinney and Irving\u2019s Las Colinas area.\nVacancy is stuck at 27.7 percent across Dallas-Fort Worth, according to JLL. The high rate is attributable to empty space in the region\u2019s office properties built in the \u201980s and \u201990s.\nThe vacancy rate has declined for Class A properties, CBRE reported, highlighting the continued prevalence of the flight-to-quality trend that has office users seeking properties with high-end amenities to lure their remote workers back to the office.\n",

        "content": "Dallas has been working behind the scenes to map out a new home for the Mavericks, even as officials keep the details under wraps.\nThe city hired Hillwood Urban Services this spring under a $75,000 consulting deal to identify potential sites for a new NBA arena, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. The three-month contract \u2014 approved administratively without City Council sign-off \u2014 tasked Hillwood with site evaluations, feasibility analysis and final recommendations for where the Mavs might land after their lease at American Airlines Center expires in 2031, in time to open an arena by the 2031-2032 NBA season.\nNeither the city nor Hillwood, the developer behind the AAC and Victory Park, disclosed what sites were studied. Dallas rejected a public records request\u00a0 from the outlet for related documents, citing confidentiality exemptions tied to economic development negotiations. The city appealed to the Texas Attorney General to keep the information sealed, saying disclosure would reveal incentive offers still in play.\n\nThe cloak-and-dagger approach comes as speculation mounts. Mavericks CEO Rick Welts confirmed last month that officials floated several possible locations and said the team is assessing two of them, though he cautioned that \u201cneither may work.\u201d Sources have suggested possibilities ranging from land near the planned convention center downtown to the former Valley View mall site in North Dallas. The county-owned jail land has also been floated, though officials say no talks have occurred.\nWelts, who previously oversaw the development of the $1.4 billion Chase Center in San Francisco during his time with the\nGolden State Warriors\n, said the\nMavericks\nare leaning toward a basketball-only facility. Hiring Welts to lead the organization last year might also provide fuel to the idea of anchoring a new stadium to a\ncasino\n.\nThe hunt for a site is only half the battle \u2014 financing could prove far trickier. In San Antonio, where officials are mulling a $1.3 billion arena for the\nSpurs\n, the funding plan includes $311 million in tourism taxes and up to $489 million in city money, alongside $500 million from the team.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

There, he doesn\u2019t have to worry that locals will elect political leaders eager to \u201cdecommoditize\u201d housing \u2014 a concept that popped up as Fallon researched\nZohran Mamdani\nin preparation for his\nTRD\ninterview.\nIn one campaign video, Mamdani says, \u201cIf we want to end the housing crisis, the solution has to be moving toward the\nfull de-commodification of housing\n.\u201d\nTo the contrary, the only feasible strategy to end \u2014 or prevent \u2014 a housing crisis is to allow for-profit development at scale.\nFallon does that by building affordable units the traditional way, typically with Low Income Housing Tax Credits, partnerships with big insurers such as Mass Mutual and Prudential, and debt from major lenders including\nFortress Investment Group\n; Santander,\nBank OZK\n, Wells Fargo and Key Bank.\nThe first phase of his next\nNashville project\nwill be 100 percent affordable and have north of 300 units. In the second phase, 10 percent of the units will be income-restricted. The\n$3 billion project\n, of which Fallon is the master developer, is expected to break ground next year.\n\nFallon is also working with\nCharlotte\u2019s housing authority\non a mixed-use project with 975 residential units, 405,000 square feet of office, 36,000 square feet of retail and amenities, and a 180-key hotel. Phase one includes 329 units, 20 percent of which will be affordable.\nTo be sure, the Fallon Company\u2019s last New York project was long before the socialist Mamdani came along. It has steered clear because like most developers, it prefers to operate in markets where it knows the players and the regulatory, cultural and political environment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about de-risking that whole spectrum of development as much as you can,\u201d the CEO said. \u201cIn New York, it\u2019s very complex and challenging to build.\u201d\nHis company has been in Charlotte since 2016, Raleigh since 2018 and Nashville since 2019.\n\u201cNashville in particular is very focused on \u2018how do we make this a compelling investment opportunity for a company relocation?\u2019\u201d Fallon said. \u201cYou need the city to remove friction points, and that is what the city and state are really good at.\u201d\nTennessee\u2019s capital city is pursuing smart growth and striving to be competitive with other Southeast markets in attracting development, the CEO said.\nNew York has become more\nhospitable\nto new housing since the city\u2019s vacancy rate was found to have sunk to a\nrecord low of 1.4 percent\nin 2023, but it still requires\nhigh wages\nand\nsubstantial affordability\nin large multifamily projects. The hotel workers union has effectively\nblocked nonunion hotels\n. Rezoning remains a\ncrapshoot\n, and\nhistoric districts\nand\nlocal opposition\nare major obstacles.\nDoing a big project in New York would mean navigating these pitfalls and competing with firms familiar with the ins and outs of the city; Fallon cited the Related Companies\u2019\nHudson Yards\nand Tishman Speyer\u2019s\nthe Spiral\nas among his favorite developments. He would also have to find investors to bet on that proposition.\n\u201cWe need to focus on markets where we have a competitive edge in product, in relationships, in policy,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cThat works for partners with very long-term capital.\u201d\n",

The lot is more than 20,000 square feet sitting behind gates with hedges for further privacy. Built in 1925, the New England traditional-style home recently received some touch-ups that included oak floors and interior paint.\nAside from the main residence, there\u2019s a two-story guest house with a bedroom, kitchenette and two bathrooms. Outdoors has a pool and sprawling lawns.\nThe next priciest listing to go into contract last week was 1760 Carla Ridge in Beverly Hills, which is listed for $13.5 million.\nThe Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Robby Sutton and Rayni Williams are the listing agents. Property records show a family trust is selling the home.\nThe Trousdale Estates residence has five bedrooms and five bathrooms across nearly 5,000 square feet. It offers big views of Century City, Downtown Los Angeles, the ocean and the Santa Monica Mountains.\nThe Mid-Century modern home was designed by Rex Lotery, the architect behind Elvis Presley\u2019s Trousdale Estates home.\n",

Additionally, Vistria Group, in its first ground-up development, is infusing $120 million in equity and taking a majority stake in the project as a limited partner. Alloy, as general partner, will continue to lead development and is kicking in $40 million.\nAccording to Alloy, the 730-foot tower is slated to be the world\u2019s tallest built to passive house standards, a design method aimed at cutting energy costs through extreme insulation. The project is the second phase of \u201cAlloy Block,\u201d which includes the city\u2019s first all-electric skyscraper at 505 State Street and two public schools (also passive house) at 489 State Street.\n\nOne Third Avenue will include 143 affordable housing units, with monthly rents starting at $1,023 per month. These apartments will be reserved for tenants earning, on average, 60 percent of the area median income.\nResidential space will span the 11th through 60th floors, and the tower\u2019s podium will include 60,000 square feet of office space. Two buildings constructed in the 1800s on State Street and Schermerhorn Street will also be incorporated into the development, and house 30,000 square feet of retail space.\nDemolition work on the site began earlier this year, and the development team expects to begin construction in the fall.\nWhen finished, Alloy Block is expected to include more than 1,000 homes, with 200 set aside as permanently affordable. The electric tower at 505 State Street was completed in July 2024. The developers\nsecured\n$290 million to replace a $210 million construction loan in December.\n",

Catellus and Deca have filed plans with the city of Los Angeles for its Five Points Union Specific Plan, which would require zoning changes before any shovels can hit dirt.\nAt the Wilmington site, the Anaheim Street land will be split into two portions: A commercial and recreation strip along Anaheim Street with grocery stores, cafes, sports courts and greenways, and a logistics area with warehouses to the south.\n\nThe Wilmington development would stretch across three parcels including the 410-acre refinery site, a 10-acre vacant lot north of Anaheim Street and a 20-acre propane and butane storage yard. Plans have yet to be announced for the Carson site, though it could be redeveloped for industrial logistics use. It could also face separate legal and logistical hurdles due to its location in the city of Carson.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time Catellus has undertaken such a project.\nIn 2003, the Emeryville-based firm redeveloped the 200-acre former Pacific Refinery Company near San Francisco into a residential subdivision known as Victoria by the Bay. In order to do that, the company had to remove contaminants from the site, not unlike what it will have to do in Wilmington and Carson.\nMeanwhile, in Huntington Beach, Shopoff Realty is\nlooking to redevelop\nthe\nMagnolia Tank Farm\nwith housing.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",
