        "content": "The owners of a famed Upper East Side townhouse are searching for a tenant.\nThe home known as Woolworth Mansion at 4 East 80th Street is being offered as a rental, asking $125,000 per month, according to a listing on StreetEasy. The listing, which includes the furniture, comes as the owners \u2014 the family of the late fitness magnate, Lucille Roberts \u2014 have yet to find a buyer for the five-story property, which has been up for sale since the fall.\nThe mansion, built in 1915 for the daughter of \u201cFive-and-Dime\u201d store mogul Frank Woolworth, hit the market in November for $59 million, though its asking price dropped to just under\n$50 million\nin March.\nThe Roberts first sought to offload the home in 2011, when they listed it for $90 million. The family pulled it off the market two years later without a deal and rented it in 2021 for $80,000 a month.\nRoberts and her husband, commercial real estate investor Bob Roberts, renovated the 20,000-square-foot home after purchasing it for $6 million in 1995. Roberts, who founded a chain of all-women gyms, died in 2003.\n\nThe 35-foot-wide townhouse has nine bedrooms and seven bathrooms and features a solarium, wood-paneled library, an elevator and rooftop lounge.\nThe Modlin Group\u2019s Adam Modlin has both the rental and sale listing.\nThe property joins other Upper East Side mansions also on the hunt for renters, including a Gilded Age mansion at 4 East 64th Street asking $175,000 a month. The Lenox Hill property hit the market in April with a monthly asking rent of $150,000.\nIn Carnegie Hill, a 16,000-square-foot mansion owned by former Lehman Brothers executive Robert Millard is on the market asking $85,000 a month. The home at 9 East 88th Street has been on the market for sale since 2021, asking\n$38 million\n.\nDemand for luxury rentals rose at the start of the year, as economic uncertainty sparked by President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies and persistently high interest rates kept some would-be buyers on the sidelines. Between January and April, 300 apartments asking more than $20,000 a month were rented, a 30 percent uptick compared to the same period last year, according to data from UrbanDigs.\n",

        "content": "Rialto Management Group and Hines acquired a trio of loans in Manhattan, each secured by an office property owned by the same company.\nRialto and Hines purchased the Midtown office debt totaling $99.8 million, according to\nPincusCo\n. All three properties tied to the loans are owned by Hilson Management.\nThe loans \u2014 originally issued by Flagstar Bank \u2014 are backed by 185 Madison Avenue, 5 West 37th Street and 349 Lexington Avenue. The deal closed June 27 and was recorded Aug. 1; all three transactions were executed through an entity tied to Hines Rialto Credit Partners.\nThe largest note, $35.2 million, is secured by the 71,00-square-foot building at 349 Lexington Avenue in Murray Hill. A $34.5 million note is tied to 185 Madison Avenue, an 80,000-square-foot office property, and the third, for $30 million, is backed by the 83,000-square-foot building at Five West 37th Street.\nFlagstar Bank, the seller of the notes, has previously held debt on all three properties. Signatories for the transaction were Jeremy Schwalbe for Hilson and Eric Green and Liat Heller for the Rialto and Hines joint venture.\n\nRialto and Hines did not immediately respond to requests for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nIn the fall, the two companies held the initial close on a targeted $2.5 billion commercial real estate credit fund, PERE Credit\nreported\n. They raised roughly $700 million by first close and quickly started deploying capital, geared towards originating loans backed by high-quality office buildings across the country.\nThe latest debt acquisition comes as Manhattan\u2019s office sector continues to face elevated vacancy and limited refinancing options.\nHines, based in Houston, recently\nlanded $450 million\nin fresh financing for the 1.2-million-square-foot office building it co-developed with Ivanhoe Cambridge in the Texas city. The deal represented the first in two years for a multi-tenant office tower outside New York City financed in the CMBS single-asset, single-borrower market, according to Newmark\u2019s Jonathan Firestone.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Hockey star Patrick Kane, a longtime mainstay of the Chicago Blackhawks who now plays for the Detroit Red Wings, has sold his Gold Coast condominium for $6.4 million in an off-market deal.\nThe transaction, finalized in late June, marks another example of prominent athletes exiting the\u00a0 once star-studded tower at 9 West Walton Street in Chicago, based on reports by the\nChicago Tribune\nand\nCrain\u2019s\n.\nKane purchased the four-bedroom, 4,776-square-foot condo on the building\u2019s 25th floor in 2019 for $6.46 million, meaning he sold it at a roughly 1 percent loss. The unit was held in a land trust, shielding both Kane and the buyer from direct public association, though the trustee, Jeffrey Zaluda of Kilpatrick Townsend law firm, was named in public records.\nOn the buyer\u2019s side, Coldwell Banker agent Chezi Rafaeli represented the anonymous land trust. Nancy Tassone of Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty represented Kane in the deal.\n\nKane\u2019s modest loss on the Walton Street unit pales in comparison to the nearly $1 million hit he took on Chicago real estate earlier this year, when he sold a Trump Tower condo for $2.1 million after purchasing it for $3.1 million in 2016. Kane still maintains a $5 million, 5,900-square-foot Greek Revival home in Lake Forest, which he purchased in 2022 shortly before his trade to the New York Rangers.\nThe\n9 West Walton building was once a magnet for pro athletes\n, but the trend has reversed in recent years. Kane\u2019s former teammate Jonathan Toews, who now plays for the Winnipeg Jets, sold his unit in 2019 for nearly $7 million. Former Cubs outfielder Jason Heyward sold his for $7.2 million in 2020, and ex-Bears linebacker\nKhalil Mack\nsold his in 2022 for $6.9 million. Bulls guard Zach LaVine, who bought Mack\u2019s unit, now has it listed for the same price.\nBillionaire Ken Griffin also exited the tower. In late 2024 and earlier this year, the Citadel CEO sold the tower\u2019s top four floors \u2014 including a rooftop pool deck. The top two floors and pool area were sold to Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and his wife MK Pritzker for $19 million, while the two floors below were sold on the same day in multiple land trust deals totaling nearly $16 million. It\u2019s unclear if the lower two floors that Griffin sold were purchased by the same buyer but the transactions for each closed on the same day with land trusts of similar names.\nKane played for the Blackhawks from 2007 until 2023, leading the club to three Stanley Cup championships. He played in nine NHL All-Star Games. In addition to his Chicago properties, Kane at one time owned a palatial home on the shores of Lake Erie in Hamburg, New York near his native Buffalo. He sold it in 2019 for $2.5 million.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

Notable projects include Fort Worth\u2019s Foundry District, which it sold in 2022, and the Mule Alley redevelopment in the Fort Worth Stockyards.\nThe firm is also involved in a\n$1 billion expansion\nof the historic Stockyards. The project hit a snag when M2G\u2019s development partner California-based Majestic Realty Company became embroiled in a legal dispute with the head of its Texas operations, Craig Cavileer. He left the company this spring.\nThe leap into hospitality aligns with M2G\u2019s broader mission to \u201cinspire evolution through impact and innovation,\u201d said Essl. She emphasized the company\u2019s affinity for mixed-use environments, where hospitality naturally complements retail and other asset classes.\n\nHanrattie supervised the acquisition of 23 hotels totaling more than $2 billion during his time at Crescent. At M2G, he will focus on acquiring hospitality properties in high-growth Sun Belt markets such as Texas, Georgia and Arizona. His strategy targets underperforming assets that could benefit from rebranding, repositioning or new management, especially \u201csoft brand\u201d hotels that integrate into their communities \u2014 like Fort Worth\u2019s Hotel Drover.\nHanrattie sees growing demand for hotels that offer immersive experiences beyond lodging. Whether luxury or select-service, successful investments should blur the lines between lodging, retail and local culture.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the wave of the business going forward,\u201d he told the Business Journal.\nWhile no deals have been finalized, Essl confirmed that M2G is actively evaluating potential acquisitions.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to tread lightly,\u201d she said, hinting that the firm\u2019s first hospitality project will make a bold statement.\nThe Miller sisters are identical twins who have focused on adaptive reuse, historical redevelopments and industrial property development.\n",

        "content": "Integra Real Estate offered $20.5 million for a sprawling Pembroke Pines condo complex in receivership, setting the floor price for an upcoming auction of the distressed property.\nMiami-based\nIntegra\n\u2014 led by Nelson Stabile, Paulo Tavares de Melo, Victor Ballestas and Cory Yeffet \u2014 was selected as the stalking horse bidder for Heron Pond, the 25-acre complex at 8400 Southwest First Street, according to a purchase and sale agreement included in court filings.\nThe stalking horse bid breaks down to $820,000 per acre.\nThe property consists of 19 two-story lakefront buildings with 304 condo units. Embattled Heron Pond, which had been the subject of multiple unsafe structure city notices and allegations of mismanagement against former board members, was put under the\nreceivership\nof Daniel Stermer last year. Shortly after that, the entire complex was evacuated due to structural safety concerns.\nIntegra was one of five bids that resulted from Avison Young and Fisher Auction\u2019s marketing, and offered the highest and best offer, Stermer said in a statement.\nCurrent zoning allows for a 321-unit project with one or multiple buildings up to eight stories or 100 feet tall, whichever is less, according to an analysis of the land completed by Greenspoon Marder attorney Dennis Mele. A developer would have to secure site plan approval and a plat note amendment.\n\u201cThe marketing and sale team will now return to the marketplace with this stalking horse bid in an effort to entice other parties to become qualified bidders so that we have a vibrant auction,\u201d Stermer, a consultant and former mayor of Weston, said in his statement.\nThe auction is scheduled for Sept. 25.\nIn 2023, the\ncity\ndetermined that six buildings and 26 units in seven other buildings were unsafe and ordered them evacuated. After Stermer took over as receiver last year, he found that prior evaluations of damage and repair costs were underestimated, according to his court filings. Last summer, all residents remaining at Heron Pond were\nevacuated\nfollowing ACG Engineering Services\u2019 determination that the buildings have hidden deficiencies due to inadequate design and construction.\n\nStermer decided to proceed with the\ntermination of the condo association\nand\nsale\nof the property last year. In a court filing, he cited the high cost of repairs and \u201csubstantial damage and destruction\u201d that can\u2019t be repaired \u201cwithin a reasonable period of time.\u201d\nHeron Pond was developed in 1988 as an apartment complex and converted into condos in 2006.\nIn past lawsuits, Heron Pond unit owners alleged some board members purposefully mismanaged the complex to allow it to fall into disrepair, with the goal of purchasing more units at a discount.\nIn his statement, Stermer said the five bids came from \u201cindependent third parties that have no prior relationship with Heron Pond.\u201d\nLast week, Broward Circuit Court Judge David Haimes ordered the termination of the condo governing structure of Heron Pond, allowing the sale process to proceed.\n",

Two cousins and family friends also live in the area. All of those homes were destroyed in January\u2019s Eaton Fire.\n\u201cWhere my mom\u2019s home is, never in a million years did we think that [the fire] was going to reach that far,\u201d said Camarillo, a portrait photographer who lives in nearby Pasadena and was also forced to evacuate during the fire.\nIn the beginning, post-fire, the neighbors banded together. The plan was to use the same contractor to lower costs. As reality set in with individual needs and circumstances, owners splintered off to go their own ways. Most went the conventional route of rebuilding with lumber. Camarillo\u2019s mother was in the same boat.\n\u201cThen we saw the amount of money we were going to get from the [insurance] policy that my parents had,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t going to be enough.\u201d\nInsurance would cover around 65 to 70 percent of the cost, equating to a roughly $200,000 shortfall, Camarillo estimated.\n\u201cEven with my [contractor] friend\u2019s discount, we were probably going to build a house, but there would be no furniture, no appliances, no fencing, no garden,\u201d he said. \u201cSo even if we had a house, it\u2019s not really functional.\u201d\nA local newscast caught Camarillo\u2019s attention. It featured a story on Hapi Homes, the maker of panels made from light gauge steel.\nNow, his mother is one of several homeowners in\nAltadena\nand\nPacific Palisades\nlooking to\nalternative homebuilding methods\nthat promise an affordable and faster path back into their residences.\nIn Camarillo\u2019s case, he was seeing Hapi Homes kit pricing quoted for $82 per square foot. At the time, quotes were no less than $500 per square foot to go the traditional route. He\u2019s now hearing of costs shooting up to $600 a foot.\nCamarillo\u2019s mother is ready to wrap up the design work soon. Building will take between six to eight weeks and he\u2019s hoping they can break ground as early as December.\nAlternative solutions\nHapi Homes is what\u2019s known as a maker of panelized homebuilding materials. Unlike modular homes that are assembled in a factory and then placed onto a lot, panelized homes are built with panels manufactured in a facility and then assembled on a home\u2019s site.\nFor the massive rebuild now underway in Altadena and\nPacific Palisades\n, the idea of\naffordable\nand fast construction using light gauge steel is appealing with companies such as Hapi Homes and RSG 3-D seeing business spike. There\u2019s also\nSamara\n, which is linked with Rick Caruso\u2019s Steadfast LA nonprofit to provide homes for free to low-income residents impacted by the wildfires.\nSometimes, it can be hard to break from tradition.\nCamarillo said he spread the word on Hapi Homes with his mother\u2019s neighbors and has posted about the company on the Nextdoor app in a bid to help the community get back to a sense of normalcy faster.\n\u201cI tried with them, but there\u2019s this innate skepticism about building with light gauge steel and the skepticism is lack of knowledge,\u201d he said.\nThe tides may be turning.\nMary O\u2019Brien, CEO and co-founder of Hapi Homes, said the number of inbound inquiries into the company has ticked up from Californians since February.\nThe company is currently in the design stage with 30 rebuild clients in Altadena and Pasadena. That\u2019s still a sliver of the 6,785 damaged and destroyed properties in the unincorporated parts of Los Angeles County destroyed by the Eaton Fire. As of Monday, 86 permits for single-family homes have been issued for that same area with 1,307 applications received, according to the county.\nThe majority of Hapi Homes customers are rebuilding in the 1,500- to 2,000-per-square-foot range. Several of them, like Camarillo, have visited the company\u2019s Salt Lake City, Utah factory to see the materials for themselves.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re hearing constantly are identical stories: People seeking us out because they\u2019re underinsured and they\u2019re looking for alternative ways to build aside from timber,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cSeparately, they\u2019re looking at innovation to help them get them into their homes faster.\u201d\n\nHapi Homes\u2019 build kits range from $60 to $120 per square foot. When factoring in the price of a contractor \u2014 Hapi Homes currently has three working with several of its clients \u2014 the total is somewhere under $250 per square foot, according to O\u2019Brien.\nWhen a homeowner decides to move forward, they begin with the design stage, which typically takes about six weeks. The current holdup is in topography surveys, with one of the company\u2019s clients waiting around 12 weeks to get that done. It\u2019s performed by an outside service Hapi Homes doesn\u2019t provide but is critical for architects and engineers to move forward.\nWhen it comes to obtaining the actual permits, O\u2019Brien isn\u2019t concerned.\nShe pointed to one of the company\u2019s Los Angeles County clients not impacted by the fires, who received an accessory dwelling unit permit in two weeks at the end of March.\n\u201cLook, there\u2019s always going to be delays or unknowns, but we\u2019re comfortable with the fact that once we have the [permit] submission in, we\u2019re not necessarily anticipating problems,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce the permitting is complete, we\u2019ll have the build kit on site in 30 days. Once you have control, it\u2019s not a long lifecycle to actually get into your house.\u201d\n\u201cRisk in every direction\u201d\nHapi Homes is set to open a Pasadena office this month, planting a project manager and quality control workers into an expanding market for its business.\nThe company isn\u2019t the only one seeing demand shoot up on account of the rebuilding.\nKen Calligar, founder and CEO of RSG 3-D, calls panelized housing an industry disruptor, but noted it\u2019s in the early adopter phase.\n\u201cPeople are not aware that there is such a thing as a resilient home because all they\u2019ve ever seen is a wood-framed home and so that\u2019s what we really work on is awareness and education,\u201d Calligar said.\nRSG is mainly a manufacturer of panels, although over the years it\u2019s built out its company-owned engineering and construction divisions. The company\u2019s pitch is housing that stands up to natural disasters and is sustainable by eliminating the waste and dumping fees associated with timber.\nDeep-seeded housing issues in the state, ranging from the impact on property from continuous wildfires and earthquakes to the shrinking of\ninsurance\navailability are now being placed under a microscope once again in areas such as Altadena and the Palisades.\nRSG said about two-thirds of new builds using its materials are from first timers to panelized housing, with about 75 percent of the business client led from word of mouth.\n\u201cPeople really understand the [homebuilding] challenges, especially in California now and of course in hurricane regions,\u201d Calligar said. \u201cThe state of California is a massive risk in every direction. It\u2019s just a giant geography of risk and it\u2019s not reducing.\u201d\nMost of RSG\u2019s rebuild clients are currently in the Palisades, with the remainder in Altadena, Malibu and Ventura County.\nIn total, there are 40 to 50 homeowners, who have architects and expect to use RSG 3-D, Calligar said. Of that total, between 20 to 30 are moving forward with permitting. RSG also has another 20 to 30 homeowners now ready to find an architect.\nThe first of the company\u2019s rebuild projects is slated to begin assembly in late September. Additional details could not be disclosed due to a non-disclosure agreement with the client, according to Calligar.\nAs with what O\u2019Brien of Hapi Homes noted, it\u2019s the financing that\u2019s the headache. Calligar said he has seen a funding shortfall \u201calmost universally\u201d among homeowners. He partially attributes that to flawed modeling on the part of\ninsurance\ncompanies when it comes to assessing risk that\u2019s now set off a chain reaction playing out in real time for the state\u2019s most closely watched construction sites in Altadena and the Palisades.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an existential financial problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t get insurance, you can\u2019t get a mortgage. If you can\u2019t afford insurance, you have to move.\u201d\nCalligar noted bigger problems not likely to be solved in the time it takes to rebuild the burned communities. For affected homeowners, they just want to go home.\nBack in Altadena, Camarillo\u2019s mother is 88. She\u2019s been lamenting she may never get back into her home. The opportunity to return faster than many of her neighbors offers a sense of relief after six months of loss and uncertainty.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the human part of this. The emotional part, the brain fog, the trauma, the sleepless nights and just the panic,\u201d Camarillo said. \u201cWithin all of that you have to pick up the pieces of your life and try to navigate and make the best decisions for you personally. I don\u2019t wish, not even the evacuation part of this, on anyone.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Spirit Halloween has revealed 25 Houston-area locations for its pop-up stores this fall, continuing its annual strategy of short-term leases in recently vacated retail spaces.\nThe holiday store chain, based in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey, plans to open about half the locations in August, with the remainder marked \u201ccoming soon\u201d on the company\u2019s website, according to a\nreport from the Houston Business Journal\n. The company\u2019s short-term leases provide temporary relief for landlords looking to fill empty storefronts and stimulate foot traffic at their properties.\nThe seasonal retailer is moving into former sites of major chains that have shuttered. The list of former tenants features many of the highest-profile bankrupt brands in retail for recent years, including Party City, Conn\u2019s, Big Lots, Joann Fabrics, BuyBuy Baby, Tuesday Morning and Forever 21.\nSpirit Halloween locations typically vary in size between 5,000 and 50,000 square feet, according to its website.\nThe company utilizes this temporary approach to secure high visibility and prime locations ahead of its fall selling season, according to the Business Journal. In terms of scope, last year the chain opened a record 1,525 locations, while the total for this year is still undetermined.\n\nThe outlet compiled a list of the spots in Houston where Spirit Halloween will open in August, together with the previous tenants:\nAtascocita: Former Tuesday Morning, 8072 FM 1960 Road East;\nBaybrook: Former Conn's, 1020 W.

        "content": "Claire\u2019s Stores, the teen-focused fashion accessory retailer, has taken a step toward Chapter 11 bankruptcy after reportedly skipping rent payments for June and July at some leased locations.\nA Bloomberg\nreport\nciting sources familiar with the matter said the filing could come as soon as this week, but timing remains uncertain as the company makes its final preparations. The chain, founded in 1961, is headquartered in the Hoffman Estates suburb of Chicago.\nClaire\u2019s struggles and its impending second bankruptcy reflect a\nbroader downturn\namong chains once popular in malls and big box spaces within retail strip centers that has weighed on commercial real estate. Beyond major bankruptcies like those of Party City, Big Lots, Joann, and Rite Aid \u2014 which are forcing widespread store closures and contributing to vacant retail spaces \u2014 the commercial property market also faces challenges from tariffs and trade wars, causing merchants to hesitate on expanding their physical storefronts.\nTo start this year, net occupancy in the retail sector decreased by about 6 million square feet, marking the weakest quarter since the onset of the pandemic, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield. This decline signals a retreat for retailers, with a two-year period of net expansion concluding last year as 1,300 more stores closed than opened, as reported by Coresight Research.\nClaire\u2019s has been exploring restructuring strategies, including a possible sale, amid deteriorating cash flow and a sizable debt load. Earlier this year, the company delayed interest payments in an effort to preserve cash. The retailer faces heightened financial pressure with a nearly $500 million loan maturing in December 2026 trading at just 37 cents on the dollar \u2014 down from 76 cents in June.\n\nThis would mark the retailer\u2019s second bankruptcy in a decade. A 2018 restructuring handed ownership to investment firms Elliott Management and Monarch Alternative Capital.\nQuestions around U.S. tariff\u00a0 policy have further clouded Claire\u2019s future. The company and its key stakeholders declined to comment on the situation.\nClaire\u2019s was once a fixture in U.S. malls selling inexpensive jewelry and accessories to a teen and tween female clientele. The firm claims it has pierced more than 100 million ears during its 64-year existence. Last year Ryan Vero stepped down as CEO and was replaced by Interim CEO Chris Cramer.\n\u2014 Joel Russell\n",

The Jackson Group acquired the building in 2015 for $21.8 million; the following year, the firm took out a loan from Citigroup guaranteed by the property for $12.7 million.\n\nWhen the Jackson Group was served a default notice last June for the property, it was $258,000 behind in payments on that loan. By the time the foreclosure auction rolled around, the total debt, penalties and fees associated with the debt was $14.4 million.\nBack in 2022, the Jackson Group lost the bottom two retail floors of the Grace Building after defaulting on a $28.5 million loan. It went into receivership shortly thereafter.\nThe Jackson Group originally bought the 12,907-square-foot property at the Grace Building in 2014 for $46 million. The first two floors fell 62 percent in value from an appraised estimate of $46 million in 2016 to $17.3 million in 2024, according to the Business Times.

        "content": "Jared Solomon, the former Vornado vice president\naccused of embezzling more than $9 million\nfrom the REIT, has decided to fight the charges.\nSolomon, alongside his attorney, Peter Toumbekis, pleaded not guilty on December 4 after prosecutors from the U.S. Southern District\u2019s office charged him with one count each of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft.\nIn May, prosecutors told the judge overseeing the case that they had reached an agreement in principle with Solomon to change his plea to guilty. But soon after, Solomon brought on a new legal team at Aidala, Bertuna &amp; Kamins, who said they needed more time to review his case.\nThe judge decided to extend the schedule for pretrial motions. After about three months, the Aidalia, Bertuna &amp; Kamins attorneys told the court last week there had been a \u201ccomplete breakdown in the attorney-client relationship\u201d and they would be resigning from the case.\n\u201cWe have reached the \u2018point of no return\u2019 in our representation of Mr. Solomon,\u201d attorney Arthur Aidala wrote. \u201cDespite our best efforts, the attorney-client relationship is beyond repair. Due to multiple significant communication-related issues, we do not believe we can provide an adequate defense for Mr. Solomon any longer.\u201d\nAidala additionally noted that Toumbekis had remained involved in the case, and on Monday, Toumbekis told the court that he plans to move to dismiss the charges on constitutional grounds on Sept. 29.\nToumbekis said that the government\u2019s indictment fails to provide clear and specific allegations that Solomon can defend himself against.\n\n\u201cHere, the indictment provides no detail whatsoever \u2014 no specific dates, acts, victims, misrepresentations, or transmissions,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe lack of meaningful factual allegations renders the indictment impermissibly vague and invites arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Southern District U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office declined to comment.\nThe government\u2019s indictment is light on details.\nIt accused Solomon of devising a scheme to defraud an unidentified \u201cVictim Company 1\u201d between 2009 and 2023, but didn\u2019t explain anything about how the scheme operated.\nA person familiar with the allegations, however, told\nThe Real Deal\nthat it has to do with Vornado\u2019s Times Square signage business.\nIf found guilty, Solomon faces up to 20 years in prison and will have to pay the millions he allegedly stole. That allegedly includes a Westchester home at Three Beverly Road in Purchase, New York (which records show Solomon bought for $4.55 million in 2023), a co-op apartment at 23 East 74th Street ($3.95 million in 2020, per StreetEasy) as well as money in Solomon\u2019s bank account.\n",

        "content": "New York City Housing Authority and Related Companies\u2019 plans for transforming a public housing site in West Chelsea are coming into focus.\nNYCHA and Related filed plans for a 12-story building at 401 West 19th Street, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The plan for the 217-unit property was filed with the New York City Department of Buildings.\nThe building would span 211,000 square feet, including nearly 11,000 square feet for a community facility. NYCHA recently filed plans to demolish the seven-story, 36-unit building at the site, which were approved.\nPlans to revamp the Fulton and Elliott-Chelsea Houses, which include the site in question, date back several years. A\nsurvey of NYCHA residents\nreported in 2023 found that more were in favor of tearing down and redeveloping the properties than simply rehabilitating them.\n\u201cThe redevelopment plan puts NYCHA residents first, creating a more equitable living experience for them in Chelsea, inclusive of the modern amenities and accessibility features that many of their neighbors are accustomed to,\u201d a NYCHA spokesperson said in a statement.\nRepresentatives for the developers did not respond to a request for comment from the outlet.\n\nIn 2019, tenants rejected a proposal to demolish at least two of the public housing buildings, opting instead to have the developers renovate. But the cost of those renovations skyrocketed in the intervening years, pushing a full rebuild as a practical option.\nThe developers, which also include Essence Development, are tasked with replacing more than 2,000 public housing units. They will also construct retail and commercial space, as well as 3,500 mixed-income apartments; 1,000 of those will be put aside at affordable rates.\nAs of 2023, the project was expected to cost $1.5 billion.\nNew York City\u2019s public housing authority has been under increased pressure to fill its empty units, which are\nmore plentiful\nthan previously believed. When including units being held for resident relocations within NYCHA, those that need substantial repairs and those being converted to community uses, the number of vacant units is greater than 8,600.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Latin American investment banker Daniel Canel and his wife, Silvia Estela, sold their waterfront Key Biscayne home for $31.8 million.\nThe sale marks one of the most expensive residential trades on the island since 2015.\nCanel, who is now managing director of DC Consulting Services, and Estela sold the property at\n330 Harbor Drive\nto Farm House Trust. The true buyer is unknown.\nOne Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Jorge Uribe represented the sellers. Brigitte de Langeron of DLS International Realty represented the buyer, according to the listing.\nThe 7,178-square-foot, six-bedroom and eight-bathroom house sits on more than half an acre with 120 feet of water frontage. It was built in 1996 and previously sold for $8.7 million in 2012. It was most recently asking $34.5 million.\n\nThe property underwent a renovation that was completed in 2014. It includes a private dock, rooftop pickleball court and a covered outdoor kitchen overlooking the water.\nCanel previously led the international bank Patagon, which was acquired by Banco Santander Central Hispano. He has also worked for UBS Warburg, Chase and JP Morgan, according to his LinkedIn.\nThe luxury residential market in Key Biscayne has seen a handful of pricey deals in the last year. Nearly a dozen homes on the island are asking more than $15 million, according to\nRealtor.com\n.\nIn July, longtime homeowners Simon and Claire Mueller sold their property at 510 South Mashta Drive for\n$18.9 million\n. De Langeron was also involved in the sale of that waterfront home. Three months earlier, Jenny Katherine Lindley Suarez, a scion of Peru\u2019s Lindley family, the makers of Inca Kola,\npaid $13.8 million\nfor a waterfront home on the same street.\nThe existing record in Key Biscayne is still held\nby the sale of the former Matheson estate,\na 2-acre property at 775 South Mashta Drive, a decade ago.\nDevelopers are also paying attention. In April, Terra\u2019s David Martin partnered with Edgardo Defortuna\u2019s Fortune International Group to buy a 3.9-acre development site for\na record $205 million\n. The partners are planning a 56-unit ultra-luxury condo building.",

        "content": "The Lone Star State\u2019s top 10 listings are usually dominated by Dallas estates, but a Southlake mansion has made the latest list.\nThe seller, Grapevine businessman Monty Patterson, is asking $8.75 million for the five-bed, seven-bath house at 1711 Maranatha Way, according to the statewide list from Houston Association of Realtors, which covers July.\u00a0 It was built in 2017, and Michael Hershenberg of the Hershenberg Group has the listing.\nThe 8,000-square-foot home on 3.7 acres straddles Southlake and Westlake in a suburban stretch of Tarrant County that\u2019s one of the most affluent areas in the state.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty uncommon for property to be built on a couple of acres in Southlake,\u201d Hershenberg said.\nThe home is the only property among the top 10 not in Dallas County or Harris County, and it comes to $1,100 per square foot at its asking price.\nThe gated property includes a sports court, a heated pool, a barn and a six-car garage. The house boasts a wine cellar and four stone fireplaces.\nSchools, space and airport access are big draws for the property, according to Hershenberg \u2014 not to mention its proximity to Vaquero Golf Course. The house is 13 miles from DFW International Airport and within Keller Independent School District.\n\nThis listing is part of an uptick in luxury offerings Hershenberg typically sees around this time of year as wealthy clients seek year-end tax advantages. The majority of closings come in the second half of the year, he said.\nPlus, \u201cPeople are trying to get settled before school starts,\u201d said Erwin Nicholas II, a Houston-based agent who specializes in luxury homes.\nIn addition, homes of this size in the Southlake-Westlake area are freeing up as empty-nesters move to properties that are easier to maintain, according to Hershenberg.\n\u201cThese owners purchase homes and move to something a little bit more turnkey. Sometimes you don\u2019t want to spend your retiree years maintaining a five-acre estate,\u201d Hershenberg said.\nMid-market buyers might be standing on the sidelines waiting for interest rates to fall, but that\u2019s not the case for the luxury sector where many buyers pay in cash.\nThe luxury market in North Texas is coming out on top. Last year\u2019s Compass luxury report reported the brokerage sold 13 homes for more than $10 million in Dallas-Fort Worth last year, compared with five in Houston and zero in Austin.\n",

        "content": "Developer Gary Melius has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a bid to save Oheka Castle from being sold.\nAccording to the bankruptcy filing, the property owes $63.5 million to creditors and has just $57.27 in a checking account,\nNewsday\nreported. Its assets total $92.8 million, including the property itself, machinery, equipment and vehicles.\nFiling for Chapter 11 will allow the politically connected Long Island developer some breathing room, providing a temporary stay on\nforeclosure\nproceedings that have plagued the property for almost a decade.\n\u201cI had a foreclosure; I was going to lose the place on Aug. 7. I\u2019ve been in foreclosure for 10 years, but the judge gave them permission to sell it, so I could no longer keep them at bay,\u201d Melius told Newsday, speaking about banks and lenders. The property was set to be sold at auction on Thursday.\nThe 109,000-square-foot chateau acts as a hotel, restaurant and wedding venue. Melius hopes to bring in more cash with plans to build a 95-unit, four-story\ncondominium\non castle grounds. His lawyer told Newsday that these concurrent ventures will allow him to pay back lenders.\n\nThe condominiums were the source of a 2023 lawsuit brought by the Cold Spring Country Club, which alleged the town board \u201cabused its authority\u201d after approving a permit Melius needed due to the chateau\u2019s location within Huntington\u2019s historic building overlay district.\nThe castle was built in 1921 for banker Otto Kahn and is the second-largest private residence ever constructed in the United States, according to the castle\u2019s website. Melius originally bought the property in 1984 and resides there himself.\nIn 1941, the castle was used as the set for Xanadu in the movie \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d appeared in the HBO show \u201cSuccession\u201d and was the site of the music video for Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cBlank Space.\u201d It\u2019s also been the venue for several celebrity weddings, including musician Kevin Jonas and disgraced congressman Anthony Weiner.\nMelius was shot in an apparent\nassassination attempt\noutside the castle in 2014. The case remains unsolved.\n\u2014\nQuinn Waller\n",

The property is proposed for a development with 350 condos and 180 hotel keys with ground-floor retail.\nLed by Philippe Zuber, Kerzner\u2019s brands include Atlantis Resorts, One&amp;Only, Siro resorts and Rare Finds. Its website does not list any U.S. hotels.

The project consists of about 500,000 square feet of retail; the 43-story Reach and Rise condo buildings; the 352-key East Hotel at Brickell City Centre; and a pair of office buildings.\nThe firm has been steadily divesting of the mixed-use complex, shedding two major sites this year. In June, Swire sold its 75 percent stake in the retail portion of Brickell City Centre and the underground parking garages to Simon Property Group for\n$512 million\n. Simon already owned a 25 percent stake in the properties.\nIn May, Swire sold a 2.8-acre development site, scrapping plans for an office supertall. Miami-based Melo Group, led by the Argentine Melo family, bought the property for\n$211.5 million\n.\nFunds tied to Trinity Fund Advisors and Certares Real Estate Management bought the East Hotel for\n$174 million\nin 2021. Northwood Investors paid\n$163 million\nfor the Two Brickell City Centre and Three Brickell City Centre office buildings in 2020.\nKerzner is at least the second Dubai-based real estate firm to home in on a prime South Florida development site.

        "content": "Downtown Chicago condo market sales continue to struggle with ever-decreasing value, as some properties are changing hands for substantially less than what they sold for more than 15 years ago.\nThe downtown slump is by all accounts an outlier to the rest of the Chicago-area\u2019s robust housing market. Local real estate agents point to a combination of a slow return to office work from the pandemic and an increase in downtown criminal activity, as reported by\nCrain\u2019s\n. The perception of downtown as a \u201cprime, luxurious market\u201d has dwindled, Coldwell Banker\u2019s Chezi Rafaeli told the outlet, as buyers look beyond Streeterville and the Loop to the West Loop, Lincoln Park and beyond.\nRecent sales recorded during the last few days showed losses in value in the millions, such as a three-bedroom condo in the tower at 900 North Michigan Avenue \u2014 called the Bloomington\u2019s tower \u2014 that sold for $2.62 million. In 2009, the sellers of the property paid $5 million for it, or nearly twice the recent sale price. A\ncondo in the St. Regis tower\n, at 363 East Wacker Drive, listed for $8 million last week, down $1.2 million from the seller\u2019s purchase price in 2022,\nThe Real Deal\nfirst reported.\nOther recent deals showed significant devaluation but not quite in the millions, such as a Millennium Park-area two-bedroom condo at 6 North Michigan Avenue that sold for $200,000 less than it fetched in 2011, as well as a Trump Tower unit listed for $810,000, the same price it traded for in 2011 and $33,000 less than it sold for in 2009.\nOther factors leading to the slump include a glut of inventory downtown added during the 2000s up until the housing crash. At that time, 20,000 condos were added downtown.\n\nThe flip side of the dropoff is that it presents an opportunity for downtown renters looking to buy or anyone considering a move downtown to invest now at the lower price points. There are also recent examples of similar condos sold for greater appreciation over their prior prices, such as a Westshore Drive condo near the St. Regis tower that sold for over 40 percent more than its original sale price in 2012.\nAgent Nick Powers of Baird &amp; Warner, who helped the downtown renters that purchased the aforementioned Millennium Park condo, said the discount his clients got on a two-bedroom unit isn\u2019t necessarily a warning sign for downtown living, but might instead represent a course-correction in the market.\n\u201cJust because it was overpriced 16 years ago doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s overpriced now,\u201d Powers told the outlet.\n\u2014 Eric Weilbacher\n",

The project, developed in partnership with the City of Dallas, is scheduled to open in June 2027.\nTravis Barber, development associate at Dallas-based Generation Housing, said the project aligns with the city\u2019s goal of repurposing underutilized land. It also supports the West Oak Cliff Area Plan, which promotes diverse and mixed-income housing.\n\u201cOne of the city\u2019s goals is to repurpose underused parking lots for more housing,\u201d Barber told the Dallas Morning News. \u201cThis is a great site for the City of Dallas to invest in. It\u2019s 6.5 acres currently occupied by a church and a lot of surface parking.\u201d\n\nLocal demand is already evident, with Dallas College officials noting struggles to find housing for\u00a0 students and staff.\nThe property had been under contract since 2023, with challenges that included rezoning, applying for 4 percent housing tax credits, securing bond reservations and forming a public-private partnership with the city. The rezoning approval, obtained last summer, was a particularly complex hurdle, according to Corbin Tanenbaum of Weitzman, who brokered the deal alongside colleague Scott Smith. The team also helped the church secure a new location in Carrollton, where a property is currently under contract.\nThe $70 million development of the church site is funded through $25 million in tax-exempt bonds, $33 million in low-income housing tax credit equity, and $7 million in city-issued gap financing.\nHiLine Illinois will offer 22 units for households earning up to 30 percent of the area median income, 20 units for 31 to 50 percent of AMI, 120 units for 51 to 60 percent of AMI, and 38 units for 61 to 70 percent of AMI. Dallas\u2019 current AMI for a family of four is $117,300.\nBeyond housing, the development will feature services and extra amenities, including free tax preparation, financial literacy programs, health and wellness courses and a 2,500-square-foot co-working space.",

Let\u2019s look at building on top of libraries. Let\u2019s look at abandoned school buildings,\u201d he said.\nHe also backed faster permitting and land use approvals, including changes to ULURP and deploying artificial intelligence to process drawings and approvals.\nOn NYCHA, Adams defended public-private partnerships, including the Related-led Elliott-Chelsea rebuild.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t keep putting a Band-Aid on a cancerous sort of repairs,\u201d he said.\nAdams also made his election pitch\nto the industry\nas he tries to fend off Democratic primary winner Zohran Mamdani for the city\u2019s top office.\n\u201cMy record has been clear,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThe industry has benefited from my administration, and I am looking for them to acknowledge that benefit and give me the support I need so we can stop someone that\u2019s coming into the city that\u2019s going to be harmful, not only to the industry, but\u2026 his policy is going to be harmful to our city.\u201d\n",

Korman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe building was developed and opened in 2009 by Walton Street Capital in a joint venture with Tribeca Associates. In 2010, the pair brought 15 condo units to market, called the Smyth Upstairs. The acquisition by Republic and Capstone does not include those residential units.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lack of high-quality hotels in Tribeca and the few new openings have really been incredibly successful,\u201d said Joshua Zamir, founding partner of Capstone Equities. \u201cThis location being in southern Tribeca also benefits from demand related to World Financial Center and the Financial District.\u201d\nThe investors plan to renovate the property to bring it upmarket, but Zamir said it\u2019s too early to say how much that renovation will cost or what exactly it will involve. It\u2019s the pair\u2019s seventh hotel acquisition, following deals for The Renwick, Ink48 and Life Hotel. Rebel Hotel Company will operate the property.\n\nThe Smyth\u2019s cultural cache shot up in 2012 after Kim and Kourtney Kardashian stayed in the development while they shot the first season of E! Network\u2019s \u201cKim and Kourtney Take New York.\u201d\nThe 100-room hotel contains about 7,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor event space. The building, including the condos, is 13 stories high, according to tax records. The total area of the building is more than 71,000 square feet.\nRepublic and Capstone aren\u2019t the only investors eyeing Tribeca.\nBroad Street Development and partner TPG Angelo Gordon are seeking to\nconvert a 10-story storage facility\nat 139 Franklin Street into up to 18 upscale condo units. The pair acquired the building for about $44 million and total capitalization will cost about $100 million.\nIn March, Urban Capital Group and Prosper Property Group announced\nplans\nto turn 32 and 34 Walker Street, in part a former textile warehouse, into five full-floor loft condos and ground-floor retail.\n",

Overall, there were 238 deals, totaling about $426 million, throughout the city.\n\ud83c\udfc6Residential:\nThe top residential sale recorded in New York City was for a resale at Extell Development Company\u2019s Billionaires\u2019 Row tower,\n157 West 57th Street\n. The 66th-floor condominium transferred from one LLC to another for $24 million, about $25 million more than the unit\u2019s last trade price in 2021. The true parties in the deal are hidden. The unit spans about 4,200 square feet, pricing the deal at more than $5,700 per square foot.\n\ud83c\udfc6Commercial:\nThe priciest commercial transaction recorded in the Big Apple was in South Williamsburg.\nSimon Dushinksy\n\u2019s\nRabsky Group\noffloaded The Garnett, a mixed-use property at\n146 South Fourth Street,\nfor $82.5 million. The buyer was\nPacific Urban Investors\n, who financed the deal with a $41.2 million loan from\nNewmark\n. The Garnett, built in 2013, stands 11 stories tall and has 113 apartments.\n\ud83d\udccaCommercial:\nIn North Williamsburg, another apartment complex at\n56 North Ninth Street\ntraded hands for $66.3 million. The seller was Brooklyn-based developer\nDouble U Realty\nand the buyer was Boston-headquartered\nRockpoint Group\n, Dallas-based\nLincoln Property Company\nand\nLand Labor Capital\n. The property dates to 2019 and has 30,000 square feet of retail space.\nTruist Bank\nprovided a $44.8 million mortgage for the deal.\n\ud83d\udccaCommercial:\nA company managed by\nDavid Fu\noffloaded a five-story, mixed-use property with five apartments at\n385 Broome Street\nin Little Italy. The buyer, a company tied to\nDaniel Hedaya\nand\nMaxwell Seibald\u2019s DAX Real Estate\n, paid $10.9 million for the building, financing the purchase with an $8 million mortgage from\nInternational Finance Bank.\nThe Fu-related entity acquired the property two decades ago for $3.1 million.\n\ud83d\udccaResidential: Marco and Helga Locascio\n, via a trust, parted with a brownstone at\n45 Park Place\nin Park Slope for $6.5 million, its asking price, according to Compass. The buyers were\nNicole and Andrew Bocskocsky\n, who are both entrepreneurs. Marco Locascio is an executive at Orogen Royalties, a royalty and mineral exploration company. The townhouse, constructed around the turn of the 20th century, last sold in 2016 for $3.7 million. It went on the market in May with Compass\u2019\nAdam Sadel\nand\nJoshua Golan\n.\n\ud83d\udccaResidential: Peter Mudd\nsold a townhouse at\n527 Ninth Street\n, also in Park Slope, for $4.4 million. Mudd had owned the property since 2011, when he purchased it for $1.7 million. The buyer in the latest deal was an LLC. The three-story home has five bedrooms, three and a half bathrooms and a fireplace. Corcoran\u2019s\nJessica Buchman\nwas the lead listing agent on the deal.\n\nBy the Numbers:\nIndustrial vacancy rising as tariffs, recession fears loom\nThe vacancy rate for industrial buildings across the country is up \u2014 and more properties are slated to hit the market soon, even as President Trump\u2019s newly enacted tariffs raise questions about the U.S. economy.\nThe national industrial vacancy rate in June came in at 9 percent, a 290-basis-point increase, year over year, and a 50-basis-point rise compared to May, according to a new report from CommercialCafe, Yardi\u2019s commercial real estate listings platform.\nThe pipeline also has no shortage of square footage. So far this year, about 147 million square feet have been constructed. Another 342 million square feet is underway \u2014 near pre-pandemic levels. When these properties hit the market, the industrial stock in the U.S. will increase by 1.7 percent.\nThe spike in vacancies reverses what the industry saw during and immediately after the pandemic: Consumers, stuck at home, bought more goods online than ever, which boosted already high demand for warehouse space. This led developers to build pre-leased spec properties. Now, economic uncertainty is causing some industrial tenants to think twice about their supply chains, according to the report.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "Which is more powerful, the laws of rent stabilization or the laws of economics?\nMy Monday\ncolumn\nwas about a two-bedroom, prime West Village apartment with a stabilized rent of about $1,400 that sits vacant because it needs a $100,000 overhaul. I mentioned it in conversation with someone, to which she declared: \u201cI\u2019d pay $100,000 to get that lease.\u201d\nThink of the real-world value of a permanently renewable, low-rent lease for a renovated, 1,200-square-foot, prime Village unit that you can eventually bequeath to a roommate, such as your kid. It\u2019s in the millions.\nSo paying a hundred grand to renovate is perfectly logical for a tenant. But not legal. Or is it?\nI asked some landlords and lawyers. Here\u2019s what I learned.\nTechnically, a landlord cannot require a prospective tenant to pay for renovations in exchange for a lease. And technically, the owner must provide a code-compliant dwelling at lease-signing.\nBut if there\u2019s a high degree of trust between the landlord and tenant, wink-and-nod arrangements involving rent-stabilized leases and renovations can and do happen.\n\u201cI have a friend who has renovated rent-stabilized apartments for his kids for apartments in the West Village and Gramercy Park,\u201d one owner told me. The friend has \u201can in\u201d with the owner of those buildings, one of the city\u2019s most prominent landlords. Clearly, the two have reached some kind of understanding.\n\u201cI do the same when I can in my buildings,\u201d the owner added, referring to properties in Prospect Park South, Flatbush and Crown Heights. \u201cBut when low-rent apartments come up, they sit vacant until we find a brother or cousin of the super/porter where we can rent the apartment as is. Most of the time, they fix it up. Occasionally, they live in squalor.\u201d\nTrust is necessary because the tenant could, in theory, report the squalid conditions to the government and compel the landlord to renovate. The owner might never collect enough rent to justify the outlay and operating burden.\n\u201cI would rather invest in treasuries at 5% than get an 8% return in rent-stabilized housing,\u201d a Harlem owner of such housing\ntweeted\n. \u201cWith treasuries, I eliminate the risk of socialism and I eliminate work hours. I just buy and sit. Who wants to do all of the work associated with rent control for 3% extra?\u201d\nThe first landlord was equally blunt. \u201cI would never put any money into a low-rent apartment,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe losers are the 25- to 40-year-olds who can\u2019t afford a $5,000 market-rent apartment and can\u2019t afford doing their own renovation.\u201d\n\u201cThe whole market for fixed-up, rent-stabilized apartments is dead,\u201d he concluded. \u201cThe whole system is just so stupid.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nThe City Council considered downscaling the floor-area ratio in a Garment District portion of the Midtown South rezoning to ensure that demolish-and-rebuild projects would not pencil out. The point would be to save the manufacturing tenants in those buildings. Wouldn\u2019t that be like scratching up your new car so no one steals it? Word is the Council will reject the Garment District carveout when it votes on the broader plan Wednesday.

(It was called Riverbank West at the time.) Thank you to\nTRD\n\u2019s Alexis Manrodt for spotting this on social media.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 Surveillance technology can identify someone by the way they walk, but Council member Jennifer Guti\u00e9rrez has introduced a bill that would classify a person\u2019s gait as personal identifying and private information, Gothamist\nreported\n. The classification would create oversight into the way that the information, as well as data about phone or computer use, is used and distributed. \u201cRight now, the city can collect and share information about how you walk, type or browse \u2014 without treating it as sensitive. That needs to change,\u201d said Guti\u00e9rrez.\n\u2014 The City Council will likely not hold a vote to override Mayor Eric Adams\u2019\nveto\nthat kept Bally\u2019s proposed casino in the running for a state gaming license, City &amp; State\nreported\n. Some Council members, including Bob Holden, aren\u2019t thrilled with the Council\u2019s decision to stand down, claiming it doesn\u2019t honor Council member\nKristy Marmorato\u2019s opposition\nto the casino bid. \u201cMember deference is the only real power we have,\u201d Holden said.\n\u2014 A 2.7 magnitude earthquake hit New Jersey\u2019s Bergen County on Tuesday, three days after a 3.0 magnitude quake centered in Hasbrouck Heights, according to\nCBS News\n.

        "content": "WeWork is making moves in Manhattan.\nThe coworking giant inked a 55,000-square-foot lease at Moinian Group\u2019s\n245 Fifth Avenue\nin NoMad. The new location, slated to open in mid-2026, will span four floors \u2014 the 2nd, and the 4th through 6th \u2014 of the 24-story office building, the company announced.\nThe deal comes as WeWork embarks on a broader effort to streamline operations and double down on high-demand areas under CEO John Santora. Foot traffic at WeWork\u2019s NoMad locations (of which there are three) is up nearly 11 percent from January to June, the company said. In total, WeWork has 35 locations in New York City.\nThe new location will replace an expiring lease at Williams Equities\u2019 79 Madison Avenue, which is up for sale, according to\nCommercial Observer\n. A WeWork spokesperson declined to disclose the asking rent or length of the lease.\nA Newmark team including Scott Klau, Erik Harris and Zach Weil represented the landlord in the deal. Newmark\u2019s Aaron Ellison and Travis Milone represented WeWork.\n\nWeWork exited bankruptcy proceedings last year, slashing $4 billion in debt, adding an equity partner in Yardi Systems and revamping its C-suite with Cushman &amp; Wakefield veteran Santora.\nThe company shrunk its portfolio from a peak of 850 to around 600,\nThe Wall Street Journal\nreported. WeWork plans to invest between $80 million and $100 million into its spaces in 2025, chief marketing and communications officer Petula Lucey told the publication.\nIn a\nrecent interview\n, Santora told\nThe Real Deal\nthat he was focused on \u201csustainable growth without question, and balancing out the portfolio, balancing out that risk.\u201d\nThe Fifth Avenue lease comes on the heels of a\n60,000-square-foot lease\nat 250 Broadway, the company\u2019s first new lease in the city since 2019. This latest space will include private offices, meeting rooms and a coworking lounge.\nThe co-working firm also inked two recent Big Apple deals that it will operate on behalf of Amazon \u2013 a 304,000-square-foot lease at Vornado\u2019s 330 West 34th Street and a\n112,000-square-foot\nsublease at Brookfield Properties\u2019 5 Manhattan West.\n",

        "content": "In 1998, a city inspector walked into 109 East Ninth Street and found a gas meter and piping in a public entrance \u2014 a violation deemed hazardous by the Department of Buildings. Then the agency found an illegally installed kitchen and bathroom on the third floor.\nMore than two decades would pass before anything came of the violations at the five-story, 1860s-era single-room occupancy. But when they resurfaced, a seemingly manageable problem mushroomed into a horrific mess.\nThe story that unfolded at 109 East Ninth Street hits all the low notes of multifamily ownership in New York City: aging buildings, intractable bureaucracy, kneejerk politicians, militant activists, conniving tenants, pointless laws, housing court, administrative trials and lawsuits.\nMost of these could have been avoided had everyone sat down with the building\u2019s owner, Michael Geylik. He is not hard to find: His office is on the ground floor.\nInherited violations\nGeylik bought the 13-unit but mostly vacant SRO for $3.35 million in 2021. With permits from the Department of Buildings, he converted the former pub on the ground floor and removed the longstanding violations: the illegal partitions, kitchen, shower and toilets that tenants shared on the third floor, and a hazardous gas riser.\nThat work, approved by the city in late 2022, cured the violations from the 1990s, but Geylik still needed to replace the communal kitchen and bathroom.\nTo do that, he needed a Certificate of No Harassment. The City Council had added that layer of regulation in 2018, back when landlords had a financial incentive to vacate rent-stabilized units and sometimes used construction to harass tenants into leaving.\nThe state\u2019s rent law reform of 2019 removed the incentive, but the Council kept the anti-harassment law on the books, and in fact expanded it in 2021. Geylik applied for the certificate, known by the acronym CONH, in August 2023.\nThe Department of Housing Preservation and Development looked back six years to see if Geylik was an unscrupulous landlord. More than six months later, HPD found he was not. It granted the CONH in March 2024.\nIn April, a 4.8 magnitude earthquake shook the city. Most buildings suffered no damage, but 109 East Ninth Street was already in bad shape \u2014 far worse than Geylik realized when he bought it.\nVisible structural damage, previously flagged by a tenant named Judy Sabin, now appeared worse than before. Walls were cracking and the top four floors were severely sloped. Walking up the stairs made people nervous.\nGeylik hired Steel Core Engineering to do an analysis. Renovations were suspended pending the results \u2014 disappointing tenants who were expecting a new communal kitchen and bathroom. Their complaints would come back to haunt the landlord.\nBut the structural integrity of the building had to be addressed first.\nDepartment of Buildings engineer Philip Ng was so alarmed by Steel Core\u2019s findings that he demanded immediate exploratory openings in the walls to determine if 109 East Ninth Street was sound.\nThe next month, August 2024, DOB issued two emergency work orders. One required a full structural evaluation and corrective plan. The other demanded temporary shoring from the cellar through the second floor, which Geylik put in immediately.\nThe columns made it hard to move around his office but helped support the slanted stairwell. But much more work was needed, especially for the SRO portion of the building.\nSteel Core opened some walls and ceilings of vacant units and discovered more frightening problems. Load-bearing exterior walls had huge gaps in between the bricks, some of which could be moved by hand. Severely deteriorated masonry walls were transferring their load onto compromised mortar joints.\nMany joists had extreme water damage, and some floor joists were unsupported except by the subfloor. They were sending their load onto overloaded joists.\nThe upper floors were sagging toward the middle of the building and could collapse at any time, Steel Core told DOB in a 45-page report. The engineering firm judged them unsafe for occupancy.\nHere come the tenants\nGeylik was advised that the structural repairs would be difficult or impossible with tenants in place. Tenants likely realized that as well, and they did not want to move from units that rent for as little as\n$155 a month\n. Their housing is less expensive than a storage locker and exceedingly rare, as the city\u2019s few remaining SROs are grandfathered under ancient building codes.\nThe renters began to turn up the pressure on the landlord.\nIn November, one complained about the work Geylik was doing to comply with the emergency orders. The Department of Buildings issued a violation.\nThe agency withdrew it two weeks later, on Dec. 6, writing, \u201cAfter further review, we have determined that a permit covering the work was approved before the violation was issued.\u201d\nBut the initial action fed a narrative that Geylik was harassing tenants with unauthorized construction.\nMeanwhile, other building drama was playing out.\nA fourth-floor renter filed a detailed complaint alleging that across the hall in 4B, fellow tenant James Hicks was renting out his room through a middleman named Bobby Rich. State law requires rent-stabilized units to be a primaryv home.\n\u201cThe purported tenant, James Hicks, has not used his rent stabilized room as a primary residence or lived here for over 25 years,\u201d the neighbor wrote in December. \u201cHe has been subletting the room to various people to generate passive income for himself. I myself once sublet it from him over 10 years ago and I have receipts to prove it.\u201d\nThe complaint went on to say that a man named Tom Scarlet had rented 4B from Hicks for several years and had acknowledged paying $500 a month \u2014 about three times the legal rent, now $177.\nRecently, strangers had been using the unit for shorter periods, and given the building\u2019s poor condition and shared bathrooms, the resident across the hall was worried. Once, he called the police to report an unauthorized visitor.\n\nDocumenting illegal short-term rentals is difficult. The city\u2019s Special Operations Unit tried, visiting the building twice. The first time it could not get in. The second time it gained access but did not find a short-term renter. It closed the case in January.\nGeylik was incredulous. The owner had encountered a man in the building late last year and asked who he was. \u201cI am your tenant, James Hicks,\u201d the man said.\n\u201cI have never seen you,\u201d replied the landlord, whose surveillance system captures movement in and out of the building.\n\u201cEvery time I enter,\u201d Hicks said, \u201cI put on invisibility clothes.\u201d\nThe Harry Potter reference did not amuse Geylik, who said he recorded the conversation on his phone. \u201cJames, you haven\u2019t been residing in the building,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou have to live here.\u201d\n\u201cTake me to court,\u201d Hicks shot back.\nGeylik did.\nBut housing court in New York City is a notorious slog. Evictions can take a year or more. The case against Hicks, who Geylik believes lives in Washington, D.C., is still pending.\nAnother of Geylik\u2019s four tenants \u2014 the other units are vacant \u2014 is a CUNY photography lecturer named Patterson Beckwith. He has rented the room since he was a Cooper Union student.\nGeylik is trying to get him out as well, alleging that Beckwith no longer lives there and only uses it for storage and a mail drop. At $214 a month, it\u2019s $36 cheaper than a\n24-square-foot, East Village locker\nthat holds \u201csmall items like clothes, seasonal decorations, and a few boxes.\u201d\nGeylik hired a private investigator who gathered evidence that the professor was living with his wife in her rent-stabilized Greenpoint apartment and their\nsecond home\nin Pittsburgh, where deeds show they own three houses in a row. Geylik\u2019s cameras at 109 East Ninth Street showed the academic spent just 1 percent of his time at his 90-square-foot SRO.\nIn court, Beckwith, reportedly on the verge of tears, told a judge that the landlord brought the case to harass him. Geylik was infuriated. \u201cWhat bothers me the most,\u201d the owner said, \u201cis that he knows he doesn\u2019t reside there.\u201d\nBeckwith did not return emails seeking comment.\nGeylik took two other tenants to court for not paying rent for 18 months and two years, respectively, but the city paid the arrears through its \u201cone-shot\u201d program and the cases were dropped.\nThe tenants have brought their own housing court case against Geylik, alleging harassment.\nRepairs stymied\nIn February 2025, Geylik filed plans for $75,000 worth of work to support the roof with temporary shoring and replace the rotted framing on the upper floors with steel, paying $1,130 in filing fees for the privilege. The work would cure a violation issued by the Department of Buildings.\nWhile tenants in other buildings beg their landlords for repairs, at Geylik\u2019s property, they tried to stop him. Cooper Square, an affiliate of TakeRoot Justice, advocated for them. The landlord sensed that the group had political connections that he lacked, so he hired a government relations lawyer, former City Council member Ken Fisher.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not always wrong,\u201d Fisher said of Cooper Square, \u201cbut they\u2019re very aggressive and everyone gets painted with the same brush.\u201d\nEven before the landlord hauled them into housing court, tenants were upset that a year after HPD issued a certificate of no harassment, he still had not put in the third-floor kitchen and bathroom. They also reported heat outages, although Geylik had replaced the boiler.\nSome claimed the exploratory probing ordered by the Department of Buildings was a ruse to create dust and noise. The eviction filings amounted to harassment as well, the tenants charged.\nGeylik also refused to accept some rent checks \u2014 a standard practice when a landlord does not want to validate a disputed tenancy.\nPreviously, the city had worked with Geylik to make the building safe and habitable. But, prompted by tenant advocacy groups and local politicians, agencies began to descend on 109 East Ninth Street like a swarm of wasps.\nOne 311 call triggered a March 13 inspection that found minor violations, including missing firestopping and exposed wiring in unoccupied rooms, which Geylick quickly corrected. Days after that visit, HPD showed up with six building inspectors. An inspector returned that afternoon and issued a violation for the same infraction cited on March 13 \u2014 part of a pattern, Geylick says, of \u201cduplicate complaints on resolved technical issues.\u201d\nIt seemed to him like a mission to revoke the certificate of no harassment, which a Department of Buildings spokesperson told\nTRD\nwas needed for the upper-floor repairs job filed in February.\nCooper Square was joined in its effort by five politicians, including state Sen. Brian Kavanagh, the powerful Senate Housing Committee chair, and Council member Carlina Rivera. Without asking Geylik for his side of the story, they urged HPD in a March 25 letter to \u201ctake all necessary steps to remedy the egregious conditions in this building, including reevaluating the CONH.\u201d\n\u201cTenants were describing a lot of activity that sounded problematic,\u201d Kavanagh said in a phone interview. \u201cSo we thought it was reasonable to ask HPD to look at the conditions to make sure it was not uninhabitable.\u201d\nAgencies tend to escalate cases when asked by elected officials. On April 22, HPD suspended the certificate of no harassment, and for the past three months has been in the city\u2019s administrative court trying to revoke it. Between that and the five housing court cases, Geylik has run up large legal fees. In May alone, they were $60,000.\nHPD insists that Geylik can find a way to shore up the building without a CONH, perhaps by changing the scope of work. But the Department of Buildings makes the call.\nKavanagh told\nTRD\nthat his office could help Geylik deal with the bureaucracy if asked. \u201cOur goal is to get tenants decent conditions to live in,\u201d the senator said, \u201cnot to make life miserable for landlords.\u201d\nBut until his non-harasser status is restored by HPD, Geylik said, his hands are tied.\n\u201cOn one side, I\u2019m being pushed by DOB to fix the building,\u201d Geylik said. \u201cOn the other side, HPD won\u2019t let me.\u201d\n",

That included a San Francisco office building the company\nsold\nearlier this summer for $28 million, about half the $56.5 million Hudson Pacific purchased it for a decade ago.\nHudson Pacific is still feeling the burn of flailing office and studio sectors that are dealing with soaring vacancies and a production\nslowdown\n, respectively.\nThe company\u2019s office revenues fell to $156 million in the three months ending June 30, compared to $176 million during the same period last year. Production studio revenues fared worse too, dipping to $34 million from $42 million year-over-year.\n\nHudson Pacific chair and CEO Victor Coleman, whose total compensation was valued at about $25 million last year despite ballooning losses, hinted at offloading more properties in the future, during the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call Tuesday, and touted a bright spot: leasing.\nHudson Pacific executed 558,000 square feet in leases in the second quarter, a small increase from a year earlier but a decline from the previous quarter. Still, second-quarter leases included a six-year, 77,000-square-foot renewal with a cybersecurity company at Metro Center in Foster City; a nine-year, 41,000-square-foot renewal with a digital sports company at 11601 Wilshire in Los Angeles; and a six-year, 32,000-square-foot new lease with a bio-tech company at Page Mill Hill in Palo Alto.\nColeman said during the call the firm is banking on artificial intelligence for an office recovery and looking to Gov.

        "content": "Danish architect\nBjarke Ingels\nis set to leave his mark on Los Angeles\u2019 Arts District.\nThe Los Angeles City Council has given the green light for a mixed-use high-rise development at 670 Mesquit Street,\nUrbanize Los Angeles\nreported. The project has been in the works for nearly a decade and will rise next to the Los Angeles River between the Sixth and Seventh Street Viaducts.\nThe development would consist of four interconnected high-rise buildings, the tallest of which would be 34 stories. Among the amenities would be a deck above the nearby railroad to the east \u2014 possibly the site of a future Arts District Metro station \u2014 to get residents closer to the river.\nDeveloper Vella Group, with designs from architecture firm Bjarke Ingels Group, plans to build 676,000 square feet of offices; 894 residential units, including 144 for very low- and extremely low-income households; a 271-room hotel; a charter elementary school; and commercial spaces for retail, restaurant and art galleries. In Los Angeles County, very low-income is\ndefined\nas a maximum annual salary of $51,000 for one person, while extremely low-income caps out at $31,850.\n\nThe 670 Mesquit project would replace the Rancho Cold Storage facility owned for years by the Gallo family.\u00a0 Construction is expected to take place either over a single five-year period or in separate phases over the course of nine years. A groundbreaking date has not yet been announced. Total cost of the project is estimated at $1.4 billion, according to\nThe Los Angeles Times\n.\nWhile the project was initially proposed as an office-heavy development, the plans have since shifted to focus more on housing. When completed, it will be one of the largest residential projects to be built in Downtown Los Angeles, per the L.A. Times. The shift comes as the office vacancy rate in Los Angeles ticked up last quarter and demand for office space continues to recover post-pandemic, per Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s second-quarter\nreport\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

An affiliate of Corebridge Real Estate Investors sold the property at a $40 million profit after buying it in 2014 for approximately $27 million.\nThe 5-acre property was built in 1968 and remodeled in 2009. It comprises 147 residential units, according to the Business Journal.\nThe Citra apartments\u2019 sales price was higher than the average multifamily sales price in Santa Clara County. The complex sold with a per-unit cost of about $466,000; the five-year average for Santa Clara County is about $458,000 for properties with more than 100 units, according to CBRE data cited by the Business Journal.\nThat being said, average rent prices in Sunnyvale are lower than those in neighboring Silicon Valley cities like Mountain View, Cupertino and\nSanta Clara\n. Average monthly rent prices in Sunnyvale were about $2,125, per the Business Journal.\n\nBesides residential sales like those, Sunnyvale is proving to be a magnet for tech companies seeking office space in Silicon Valley.\nApple, for example, has plunked down nearly $1 billion for various office properties in the area. In June, the iPhone maker spent $350 million for the office buildings at 615 and\n625 North Mathilda Avenue\nin Sunnyvale; last month, it snapped up the properties next door at 505-599 North Mathilda Avenue and\n605 West Maude Avenue\nfor\n$365 million\n.\nSemiconductor manufacturer Applied Materials has been on a similar tear in Sunnyvale over the past decade. Last month, it\npaid $25.1 million\nfor an office and research building at 999 East Arques Avenue. That acquisition followed nearly $422 million in building purchases in the South Bay city since 2018, including 928 East Arques Avenue for $41.4 million; 1050-1090 East Arques Avenue for more than $100 million; and two buildings last year at 929-935 East Arques Avenue and 306-310 De Guigne Road for $32.7 million. Last October, the company\ndropped $100 million\nfor a vacant Fry\u2019s Electronics store at 1077 East Arques Avenue.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Most recently, the Peltzes took out a $40 million loan on the property in 2022, records show.\nThe Peltzes made headlines in 2022 when they hosted their daughter\nNicola\u2019s black tie wedding to Brooklyn Beckham\n, son of\nDavid and Victoria\n, at Montsorrel.\nNelson Peltz has a net worth of $1.6 billion, according to Forbes. He is best known as an activist investor and the head of Trian Fund Management. In 2021, the firm bought an office building in Palm Beach for\n$23 million\n. Last year he stepped down as the chair of Wendy\u2019s, which he had helmed for 17 years, according to published reports.\n\nThe loan comes decades after the billionaire couple bought the estate. Records show they bought the 25,300-square-foot mansion at 548 North County Road for $13.5 million in 1987. It has five bedrooms and 16 bathrooms, according to property records. It was built in 1965 by Anita Young, the widow of railroad magnate Robert R. Young and sister to artist Georgia O\u2019Keefe. Young dubbed the compound \u201cMontsorrel,\u201d meaning \u201cmountain of sorrows,\u201d according to published reports.\nIn 1988, an entity linked to the Peltzes bought the property across the street at 542 North County Road for $3 million, according to property records. They completed the 15,400-square-foot mansion in 1991, records show. Their compound totals 13.1 acres with two pools and two sport courts.\nPalm Beach\nproperty values have grown exponentially since the Peltzes bought their estate. Palm Beach County estimates the market value of the property at $372.4 million, which is likely a conservative approximation.\nThey\u2019re not the only billionaire couple tacking on a mortgage to their trophy estate. Last month, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z took out a $57.8 million mortgage on their mansion in Bel Air, California, bringing their\ntotal amount borrowed on the home to $110.6 million\n. With a combined net worth of more than $3 billion, they are considered music\u2019s richest couple.",

In April, the district\npurchased\na house next to the 12.5-acre Madronia Cemetery for $4.5 million, pointing to a forthcoming expansion.\nThe Savannah-Chanelle property at 23600 Congress Springs Road was once listed for $27.5 million, per The Mercury News. The property spans five parcels and 57.9 acres.\nThe cemetery district has been eyeing an expansion in the area, according to the\nSilicon Valley Business Journal\n.\n\u201cThis is the one we\u2019ve always wanted,\u201d Steve Albright, general manager of Madronia Cemetery, told the Business Journal about the vineyard purchase. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on this one for about a year.\u201d\n\nAbout 80 percent of the money spent on the vineyard came from debt, according to Albright. The\nSaratoga\nCemetery District will pay off the debt over the next 20 years as it prepares to turn the Savannah-Chanelle land into another cemetery for Saratoga residents.\nIn the meantime, the Cemetery District is leasing the property to Savannah-Chanelle, meaning the winery will continue to operate there for at least the next 10 years before the cemetery redevelops the land. In the lead-up to that change, the Cemetery District will work to rezone the property.\nLast year, the Ballards\nsued\nSanta Clara County after being fined more than $120,000 for allowing their vineyard manager and his family to live on the property in a recreational vehicle for more than a decade. The lawsuit is ongoing, according to the\nEast Bay Times\n.\nThe couple bought the winery in 1996\nfrom Victor Erickson\nand renamed it Savannah-Chanelle Vineyards after their two daughters. The property\u2019s history dates back more than a century when brothers Pierre and Eloi Pourroy planted vineyards at the site in 1901.

        "content": "Valencia Hotel Group scored refinancing for its River Walk hotel in San Antonio.\nThe Houston-based firm secured a $22.6 million loan for Hotel Valencia Riverwalk, at 150 East Houston Street, according to a release from Sonnenblick-Eichner Company, which arranged the deal.\nIt\u2019s a five-year, fixed-rate loan that will finance a maturing 10-year loan on the property, said Patrick Brown, a principal at Sonnenblick-Eichner. The debt amounts to $106,100 per key.\nBrown said the debt markets are \u201cextremely liquid\u201d for hotel loans, and the transaction generated a lot of interest.\nWhen Valencia developed the 213-key hotel in 2003, it was considered the city\u2019s first boutique hotel. The firm developed it on a site leased by former owner Maryland-based Federal Realty Investment Trust.\n\nValencia completed a $10 million upgrade at the property in 2017. The property features almost 10,000 square feet of meeting space, a gym, interior courtyard and three food and beverage options: Dorrego\u2019s, Naranja Tequila and Mezcal Bar, and Caf\u00e9 Naranja.\nHotel Valencia Riverwalk is part of San Antonio\u2019s most popular tourist attraction, the River Walk, which is a public park that hugs the San Antonio River and is lined with stores and restaurants. It\u2019s also within walking distance of the city\u2019s convention center.\nDespite the availability of fresh financing for hotels, San Antonio\u2019s downtown hospitality market is still struggling to stabilize after the pandemic.\nThe submarket sold 745,000 room nights in the first quarter, a drop of 15.4 percent from the first quarter of 2019, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n, citing consulting firm Source Strategies.\nValencia\u2019s other Texas properties are in Austin, Dallas, Lubbock and College Station. Its portfolio also includes a hotel in San Jose, California. It has two additional hotels in the pipeline: one in Tuscon, Arizona, and another in Arlington, Texas.\n",

        "content": "The Durst Organization joined the Manhattan refinancing wave, securing a deal for its One Five One office property in Times Square.\nWells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America agreed to originate a $1.3 billion commercial mortgage-backed security for Durst\u2019s 1.8 million-square-foot tower at 151 West 42nd Street, Bisnow\nreported\n. The loan, carrying a 6.1 percent interest rate, will pay off roughly $1.1 billion in existing debt and fund nearly $40 million in reserves and closing costs, according to an S&amp;P Global presale report.\nThe CMBS transaction includes a $719 million \u201cA\u201d note that earned a preliminary AAA rating from S&amp;P on the back of Durst\u2019s financial strength and the tower\u2019s performance. Remaining capital will go toward tenant improvements, leasing costs and a $146 million equity payout to the landlord. The deal is expected to close Aug. 19.\nGreen Street\u2019s Commercial Mortgage Alert first revealed the CMBS deal. Durst previously\nlanded a $900 million refinancing\nfrom JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo in 2019.\nDurst\u2019s Times Square tower, formerly known as 4 Times Square, is 92 percent leased. Its anchor tenant is social media app TikTok, which occupies 232,000 square feet through 2031. But the political cloud hanging over the Chinese-owned platform prompted lenders to earmark $50 million of the loan into a reserve fund in case TikTok\u2019s lease is disrupted by a U.S. ban.\n\nDurst acquired a ground lease on the property from the city and has an option to purchase it in 2027. The building was valued at $2.3 billion for the purposes of the refi.\nRents at the building average $116 per square foot. Tenants include Nasdaq,\nVenable\nand BMO Capital Markets, and the tower features H&amp;M\u2019s U.S. flagship store and prominent LED signage facing Broadway.\nThe refinancing comes as CMBS lending for New York\u2019s top-tier office properties heats up after years of drought. More than $59 billion in CMBS loans were issued nationwide in the first half of 2025 \u2014 the strongest showing since before the financial crisis, per Trepp \u2014 and other landlords including RFR, Tishman Speyer and Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge have recently inked billion-dollar-plus refinancings on Manhattan assets.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The Midtown South rezoning is moving forward, but with a few changes that shave 165 apartments off the number of housing units to be built in the neighborhood.\nThe City Council\u2019s Land Use Committee and Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises voted on Wednesday to advance the rezoning of 42 blocks in Midtown South, but reduced the residential density allowed in certain parts of the neighborhood. With the changes, the rezoning is expected to net 9,535 housing units, with 2,842 affordable. That\u2019s down from the 9,700 units, of which 2,890 would be affordable, originally projected.\nThe rezoning now heads back to the City Planning Commission before it is put up for a vote before the full City Council.\nThe rezoning will affect four\nnon-contiguous areas\nof Midtown South, bounded by 40th Street to the north, Fifth Avenue to the east, 23rd Street to the south and Eighth Avenue to the west. The areas are zoned for manufacturing use, and either bar housing construction or limit it considerably.\nThe Council reduced the residential density permitted in a four-block area within the southeast portion of the rezoning, between 23rd and 27th streets. The maximum residential floor area ratio in that perimeter was reduced from 18 to 15.\nThe Council also removed a planned high-density residential designation midblock between West 36th and 40th streets between Seventh and Eighth avenues. Council member Kevin Riley, who chairs the subcommittee, indicated that those changes would not have a significant impact on the housing expected to be built under the rezoning because the city did not expect properties in that area to be redeveloped as housing.\nHeight limits were also introduced in certain sections of the rezoning area.\nAhead of the votes, Council member Erik Bottcher noted concerns raised by fashion-related businesses in the Garment District that they would be driven out of the area as landlords emptied their buildings to redevelop their properties. Bottcher said the modified rezonings ensure that \u201cnew housing and new business growth can thrive side-by-side.\u201d\n\nThe rezoning marks the first time that the city has mapped new residential districts, known as R11 and R12. The districts, created as part of the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, respectively permit a residential floor area ratio (FAR) of 15 and 18, allowing housing projects to be 15 or 18 times larger than their lot sizes.\nThe city was able to create the new districts after the state lifted a restriction on residential density in the city last year. Residential FAR was previously capped at 12.\nThe rezoning is also the first time that Mandatory Inclusionary Housing has been used in Midtown Manhattan.\nLeading up to Wednesday\u2019s votes, elected officials and community members discussed scaling back the rezoning. One proposal called for significantly reducing density in the southeast quadrant of the rezoning area, where the city wants to allow residential space with an FAR of 18. City Planning testified during a hearing last month that such a change would result in a 55 percent loss of housing.\nWednesday\u2019s changes were not as drastic.\nCommunity Board 4 called for height limits and suggested a special permit for any residential building where the developer wishes to exceed an FAR of 12. The changes were driven, in part, to disincentivize developers from demolishing their properties.\nAs the first neighborhood rezoning to employ the new residential districts, Midtown South is a critical test for the City Council. The administration did not try to map the districts in another\nmajor rezoning in Long Island City\n, where the highest FAR for residential space under the rezoning will be 12.\nThe inability to approve these districts in a dense, transit-rich area of Midtown Manhattan would jeopardize the chances of doing so elsewhere in the city. In other words, if Midtown wasn\u2019t able to be successfully rezoned under City of Yes, it likely wouldn\u2019t happen anywhere else.\n",

Details regarding the ground lease\u2019s structure were not disclosed.\nA JLL team including Andrew Scandalios, David Giancola and Drew Isaacson represented the Wallaces in the lease deal.\nTF Cornerstone will transform the 32-story office building into a 350-unit residential complex, featuring both market-rate and affordable housing; 25 percent of the units will be for those earning up to 80 percent of the area median income. The property has a \u201cvery properly dimensioned floorplate for residential\u201d use, according to principal Jeremy Shell.\nThe developer plans to tap into the state\u2019s 467m tax exemption program, which helps facilitate the conversion of office buildings to residential properties. TF Cornerstone aims to wrap the project by 2028.\n\nThe curved tower on Billionaires\u2019 Row was\nput on the market\nlast year following a lengthy fight between Cohen and the Wallace clan. William Wallace sued to evict Cohen after he allegedly defaulted on the lease in early 2023 and started skipping out on paying millions of city property taxes.\nHe also neglected repairs, according to court documents, prompting retail tenant Saks Off Fifth to begin another court action and stop paying rent.\nCohen pushed back on the eviction attempt, laying the blame for his struggles on office vacancies and low demand. He also said Wallace gave an \u201cunreasonable refusal\u201d to a plan to\nconvert the office and retail property\ninto a residential condominium; it\u2019s unclear how Cohen\u2019s conversion would\u2019ve compared to TF Cornerstone\u2019s.\nLast year, TF Cornerstone and Dune Real Estate Partners\ncreated a $1 billion venture\nto advance office-to-residential conversions across the country.

        "content": "Despite downplaying his family\u2019s influential commercial property business while campaigning,\nreal estate scion Jason Friedman\nis emerging as a favorite among industry players to fill Rep. Danny Davis\u2019 soon-to-be-vacated House seat in the March 17 primary election.\nFriedman has raised more than $1 million in donations and is so far the only candidate in a crowded field to report fundraising totals in the race for Illinois\u2019 seventh district.\nMore than 200 of his 600-plus donations have been tied to real estate professionals, according to federal election data. Prominent donors include Waterton CEO David Schwartz, Blue Star Properties\u2019 Craig Golden, AMLI Residential CEO Gregory T. Mutz, CRG\u2019s CEO Shawn Clark and MZ Capital Partners\u2019 Michael Zaransky.\nAt least eight other challengers have recently joined the race, including state Rep. La Shawn Ford, who Davis endorsed last week. Next quarter\u2019s fundraising results will likely reveal more nuances about the candidates\u2019 coalitions.\nOther Chicago business heavyweights who have cut checks for Friedman include private investment billionaire Craig Duchossois and multiple Linden Capital Partners executives.\nFriedman\u2019s father\n, the founder of Friedman Properties, referred to as the \u201cMayor of River North,\u201d is also among his donors, as is one of the firm\u2019s retail tenants, the well-known restaurateur behind the Lettuce Entertain You empire, Richard Melman.\nWhoever takes over the seat will step in at a crucial time for the district, which has been hammered by distress in the commercial real estate market following the pandemic. The district stretches from Lawndale to River North and from the Loop to Oak Pak.\nOver Friedman Properties\u2019 55 years in the business, it has amassed a 5 million-square-foot commercial real estate portfolio, developed towers and preserved architectural landmarks. Its properties span the retail, office, multifamily and hotel sectors. Jason Friedman served as president of his father\u2019s company from 2005 until 2023.\nHe describes his approach to policymaking as one of \u201cabundance,\u201d referring to a book of the same title by political commentators Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson. The emerging political rallying call is seen among the center-left as a way to tackle issues like housing affordability via both government investment and certain kinds of deregulation.\nThe Real Deal\nspoke with Friedman about how his real estate experience will influence his campaign. Because the district is considered safely Democratic, the winner of the primary will be strongly favored in the following November general election.\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nTRD:\nYou previously worked in government but what made you want to step back into politics now as a candidate?\nJF:\nI felt that our existing public officials just weren\u2019t fighting for us anymore. This needs to be a place that people want to invest in again and that people want to raise their families in again. This particular congressional district is the most diverse district in the state of Illinois, maybe one of the most diverse in the United States. It\u2019s also the economic engine of our city and state. It\u2019s where the majority of these big real estate developments take place and where a lot of people are employed and where all of the corporations are.\nTRD:\nYour father, Albert Friedman, has been nicknamed the mayor of River North and you spent 18 years as president of his company, Friedman Properties. What role will your real estate background play in your approach to politics?\nJF:\nReal estate is an industry of collaboration. In order to build a building, you have to have a good relationship with your public officials [and] with the community, and you have to deal with union labor, good paying jobs, minority contracting and really helping businesses and entrepreneurs. It\u2019s not dissimilar from being in public service.\nTRD:\nChicago ranked 45th in construction starts per capita, according to a recent study of the 50 largest metro areas in the U.S. by Apartment List. Impact for Equity also found that the Chicago Housing Authority has 19,000 fewer homes than it did 10 years ago. At the current pace of building, the CHA won\u2019t be able to redevelop all the vacant land created by public housing demolitions for another 30 to 40 years. How do you plan to address the city\u2019s shortage of both subsidized and market rate housing?\nJF:\nIt\u2019s a huge problem. The secret sauce for achieving more affordable housing is through more supply. It\u2019s through growth. It\u2019s through this abundance strategy and the idea that Chicago and some of these other great cities have created such restrictions on the ability for developers and for owners to build that we need to figure out a way to streamline that process.\nTRD:\nWe hear a lot of that conversation on the local level, particularly at City Hall, but how does a congressperson, specifically, play a role in this issue?\nJF\n: Every aspect and chain of government is related. I would work with every alderman here. I would certainly work with the mayor\u2019s office to create pathways to business success and good public stewardship for housing abundance. The other thing we can do on a federal level is create better pathways for home ownership for first-time home buyers.\nTRD:\nTell me about your other campaign priorities and how you plan to balance representing this district. It\u2019s very economically and ethnically diverse so there may be a lot of competing priorities.\nJF:\nYou know, it\u2019s funny, I don\u2019t think there are. The community is very diverse, from Chinatown to Oak Park and from North Lawndale to Fulton Market or River North, [but] for a lot of people, the top issues are the same, which are pathways to business success, public safety and access to education. You should have the same education regardless of your zip code. You should grow up with affordability, and that\u2019s affordability in housing and affordability in health care. Sometimes we just look at it through different lenses but there\u2019s a pathway through and a lane that\u2019s the same for all of us.\n",

        "content": "The developers of Ritz-Carlton Residences, South Beach are moving forward with plans to revamp a portion of Lincoln Road.\nMiami Beach commissioners approved a resolution last month for the streetscape improvement agreement covering the 100-300 blocks of Lincoln Road. A partnership between Lionstone Development, the Ben-Josef Group and Flag Luxury Group are kicking in $4 million for the $12 million first phase, which includes the beach entrance and the 100 block.\nFlag Luxury, Lionstone and Ben-Josef, owners of the existing Sagamore and Ritz-Carlton South Beach hotels at 1671 Collins Avenue and 1 Lincoln Road, plan a\n15-story, 30-unit condo tower\non the property, which the developers are branding Billionaires\u2019 Beach.\nPricing for the condos started at $4.3 million and run as high as $125 million for a combined penthouse. The development, designed by Kobi Karp Architecture &amp; Interior Design, will include 50,000 square feet of amenities. Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund-Gomes Team is leading sales. In April, Fredrik Eklund posted on Instagram that buyers signed three contracts totaling $44 million in new deals at the project, adding to previously undisclosed presales.\nThe Ritz-Carlton Residences will be completed in 2028, according to a spokesperson for the project.\nThe\nLincoln Road\nstreetscape project could be completed at the same time or toward the end of construction of the condo project. The city will manage construction. A city memo issued in July stated that the design will be completed by next spring. Construction could start in the spring of 2027 and be completed within a year.\n\nCommissioner Alex Fernandez, who sponsored the resolution, said the project will help \u201cbring back safety, bring back beauty and pride to this neglected area.\u201d\nPeter Kanavos, a partner and senior vice president of planning and development at Flag Luxury Group, told commissioners that he expects about $1.8 million to $2 million of the developers\u2019 contribution to go toward soft costs, which includes the design. Naturalficial, led by Andres Arcila, is designing the 100 block of Lincoln Road to include a display of public art, traffic and life safety improvements and a Morris Lapidus-inspired gateway monument.\nThe county bus stop is expected to be relocated to\nWashington Avenue\n, Kanavos said.\nThe state is also contributing nearly $4.9 million in funding for hard costs, and the city is providing another $4 million in funding.\nAcross from the Ritz, Alo Yoga plans to open a new store and private health club that will take the place of a shuttered Walgreens pharmacy on the ground floor of the Decoplage condominium at 100 Lincoln Road. The Miami Beach Historic Preservation Board\napproved\nAlo\u2019s plans earlier this year.\nSobe Sky Development, the Flag Luxury, Ben-Josef and Lionstone venture, is also involved in later phases to revamp the 200 and 300 blocks of Lincoln Road.\n",

        "content": "A North Side apartment complex that replaced a Treasure Island grocery store in 2022 is on the market.\nOptima hired JLL brokers to scout a buyer for Optima Lakeview, a 199-unit, eight-story building at 3478 North Broadway, CoStar News\nreported\n. The asking price hasn\u2019t been disclosed. The property sat empty for about a year after the local grocery store chain went out of business in 2018. Optima paid $12.85 million for the property in 2019.\nOptima, which based in Scottsdale, Arizona, and Glencoe, leveled the store and took out a construction loan from Village Bank &amp; Trust, then refinanced the property last March with $56 million from PNC Bank, the outlet said. The refinancing amounted to $281,400 per unit.\nThe building is more than 90 percent leased with rents of $4.13 per square foot, nearly $4,400 per unit. The building features a rooftop deck with a pool, spa, party room, fire pits and grill stations, along with private balconies, indoor basketball and pickleball courts, a putting green and fitness center. JLL is marketing the property as a rare large apartment development in a high-density neighborhood.\n\nA slow construction pipeline and high demand for apartments has led to rent growth and increased investor interest in Chicago this year.\nChicago-area apartment sales totaled $4 billion in 2023, $3.9 billion in 2024 and clocked in at $2.3 billion halfway through this year. Major sales this year include the 375-unit\nFulbrix tower\nin Fulton Market for $170 million.\nSales of large apartment complexes on the North Side this year include the 292-unit Cobbler Square building in Old Town for $87 million, or $298,000 per unit, and the 191-unit Elevate Lincoln Park building for $114 million, or $597,000 per unit. Other apartment assets that have hit the market this year include the 275-unit\nMilieu tower\n, at 205 South Peoria Street, a 363-unit building called the Mason, at\n180 North Ada Street\n, and the 451-unit Left Bank tower at 300 North Canal Street.\n\u2014Eric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A phishing email may have cost one of Manhattan\u2019s luxury landlords nearly $19 million.\nMilford Entities, which owns and manages upscale buildings including Liberty Luxe and Liberty View in Battery Park City, mistakenly wired the massive sum to cybercriminals posing as the Battery Park City Authority, according to the\nNew York Post\n. The July incident, now under federal investigation, involved quarterly PILOT and ground-lease payments collected from condo owners \u2014 fees that typically pass through building management to the BPCA.\nThe Department of Homeland Security is leading a multi-agency probe.\nMilford confirmed the fraud in a brief statement, noting the funds involved properties both owned and managed by its affiliates. The company declined further comment to the outlet, citing the active investigation.\nThe scam appears to have targeted the automated infrastructure of PILOT payments \u2014 a quasi-property tax structure unique to Battery Park City, where condo owners pay into a fund that\u2019s funneled to the state-run BPCA.\n\nMilford, which oversees at least nine buildings and more than 2,000 units in the neighborhood, serves as intermediary for a sizable share of those payments.\nThe BPCA said it never received the payment and was not itself affected. But fallout from the scam has rippled through the neighborhood. One condo board was told $3.5 million of its dues vanished in the transfer.\nThe BPC Homeowners Coalition, which represents 18 buildings, warned residents in an email that the attack \u2014 likely the first of its kind in the area\u2014won\u2019t be the last, urging buildings to review cybersecurity protocols.\nThe need for strong cybersecurity is only likely to grow in the industry, especially as cryptocurrency becomes more omnipresent in transactions.\nLast year, a homebuyer\nfiled a federal lawsuit\nagainst his lawyer and the lawyer\u2019s firm in Ridgefield, Connecticut. The buyer blamed the attorneys for a loss of almost $600,000, claiming hackers accessed the firm\u2019s private emails to obtain key information about the transaction, enabling hackers to walk off with $726,000, of which the banks were only able to recover $129,000.\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The sale of the 100,000-square-foot property breaks down to $663 per square foot.\nDouble U developed the property in 2019, but put it on the market last year seeking $80 million, according to Meridian Capital Group materials. The asking price was ultimately lowered to $77 million, then $73 million before its sale last month; Meridian\u2019s Chirag Doshi had the listing.\nTruist Bank provided a $44.8 million mortgage for the deal, according to property records.\nThe six-story rental building near the waterfront is fully leased, including 45 residential units. The last three transactions recorded on\nStreetEasy\nwere for two-bedroom units, all commanding at least $7,000 in rent.\nThere\u2019s also 27,000 square feet of retail space, spread across the bottom three floors. Tenants include the Veterinary Emergency Group, which paid a starting rent of $128 per square foot for its 5,000-square-foot space. The property has a net operating income of $4.4 million, according to Meridian\u2019s marketing materials.\n\nDouble U and Lincoln did not respond to the outlet\u2019s requests for comment, while Rockpoint declined to comment.\nThree months ago, Double U\nfiled permits\nto convert a vacant two-story building at 144 Greenpoint Avenue into a six-story mixed-use building. The plans call for a 6,200-square-foot ground floor retail space and 35 apartments perched above.\nElsewhere in Williamsburg, CIM Group and Osiris Ventures recently\nsnapped up\n190 Berry Street from LENY for $55.7 million out of bankruptcy.

Other VSGS partners include Argentine retired professional basketball player and NBA Hall of Famer\nManu Gin\u00f3bili\n; ex-professional tennis players Juan \u201cPico\u201d M\u00f3naco and Mariano Zabaleta; and\nRiccardo Silva\n, a real estate investor and owner of Miami FC, a professional soccer team that plays in the USL Championship league.\nMiami FC would play its home games in the planned stadium, which would also host other sporting events, including the Homestead Championship Rodeo, city documents state.\nVSGS\nhad previously been negotiating with Miami-Dade County to build the project on county-owned land near Homestead Air Reserve Base. A VSGS spokesperson said the firm withdrew its proposal to the county.\n\nThe developer submitted a letter of intent to Homestead in May, and city officials began negotiations with VSGS the same month, Homestead City Manager Nzeribe \u201cZerry\u201d Ihekwaba said at the July 30 city council meeting.\nHomestead Mayor Steven Losner, who participated in the negotiations, said the lease terms were vetted by the city\u2019s financial consultants, and the city and VSGS came to an agreement on the property\u2019s fair market value.\n\u201cThese folks are going to make a significant equity contribution,\u201d Losner told his council colleagues. \u201cWe have hard and fast and clear obligations on both sides of this deal.\u201d\nUnder the ground lease approved by the Homestead city council, VSGS agreed to pay the city $200,000 upon starting construction, which is planned for early next year, the agreement shows.\nThe developer will pay the city another $300,000 while the project is under construction. In 2030, when the project is expected to be completed, VSGS will pay $500,000 in annual rent for a five-year period. Thereafter, the firm will pay $852,000 annually. VSGS also agreed to share a percentage of revenues derived from sports event ticket sales, hotel rooms and naming rights.",

It has 15,000 square feet of contemporary design sitting above a private cul-de-sac. The three-level mansion boasts a primary suite with its own private patio, bar, temperature-controlled wine cellar, screening room, wellness center, outdoor kitchen, pool, staff quarters and an eight-car garage.\nMaman purchased the property in 2021 through Maman Properties LLC for $5.8 million from Chickory Lane LLC, according to property records. Chickory LLC is managed by Bill Zutter and operates as an investment rental business tied to a Florida address, according to filings with the state Following his purchase, Maman went on to build the home anew and completed it this year.\nThe Agency\u2019s Santiago Arana is marketing the property.\nThe listing comes after Maman\u2019s March sale of\n1050 Stradella Road\nin Bel Air for $25 million. The closing price was a steep cut from the $33.8 million the new build originally hit the market for in March 2024.

The overall number of transactions totaled 71 in the second quarter, which was up 7.6 percent from the same three months in 2025.\nProperties also appear to be sitting on the market for shorter periods at 51 days, which is down 5.6 percent from the year-ago period.\nThe market data may be lagging from what some agents are seeing play out currently, while also hinting at what could materialize in the third-quarter Elliman Report.\nElliman noted bidding wars were down from 25.5 percent of transactions in the second quarter of last year to 21.3 percent in the same three months in 2025, potentially hinting at a cooling. Meanwhile, the report suggests the pace of dealmaking, a gauge of how quickly the market can burn through and sell available inventory, slowed to 21.8 percent annually.\n",

        "content": "Weeks after completing a $343 capital raise, Scott Everett\u2019s S2 Capital is buying up industrial operator Fort Capital.\nFort Capital has an 11 million-square-foot industrial portfolio and a pipeline of $350 million in targeted acquisitions, according to a release from S2.\nThe Dallas-based multifamily syndicator is hiring Chris Roach as president of the new vertical; Parker McCormack is coming on as chief investment officer.\nFort, which was founded by Chris Powers in 2010, focuses on value-add industrial assets in high-growth markets. Specifically, it specializes in shallow-bay infill properties.\nIn a statement, Everett pointed to the growth of e-commerce and rising transportation costs as the reasoning for S2\u2019s foray into industrial real estate.\nNews of the merger comes after S2 announced the closure of its second value-add fund.\n\nThe capital was raised from investors like multifamily offices and public pensions. The fund will target distressed assets that it can upgrade, and 60 percent of the capital has already been invested in 14 properties in Texas, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Tennessee, Georgia and the Carolinas.\nS2 closed its first multifamily fund in September 2022 at $400 million. It hasn\u2019t returned capital from this fund, but it landed a $500 million refi deal that provided distributions to limited partners.\nEverett has been more successful at dealing with the higher interest rate environment than syndicator peers like Rise48 and Tides Equities.\nIn an effort to shield his syndicated deals from the floating-rate debt that was the downfall of his peers, he launched the\nbiggest private REIT\nlast year. Everett capitalized on his survivor status by taking a\nbig bite of syndicator GVA\u2019s distress mess\n. S2 joined as a general partner on a $60 million recapitalization deal.\nEven so, there have been speed bumps along the way. The firm faced foreclosure on an apartment complex last month after appearing to default on a\n$36 million mortgage\nprovided by CBRE for Preslee Apartments, at 2504 Ivy Brook Court in Arlington. The 290-unit apartment complex was built in 1981. The loan amounted to $124,000 per unit.\n",

        "content": "Billionaire Quogue Capital founder Wayne Rothbaum sold a second oceanfront lot in Delray Beach for $22 million, bringing his total sale to $44 million in three months.\nRecords show his 941 South Ocean Blvd LLC sold the 1.4-acre property at 941 South Ocean Boulevard to another entity named for the address and managed by Coral Springs-based attorney Larry Rothenberg. It mirrors his May sale of the adjacent lot at 939 South Ocean Boulevard, which also went to an entity controlled by Rothenberg for\n$22 million\n. The combined value of the sales is $44 million.\nNick Malinosky with Douglas Elliman represented both sides in the latest deal.\n\nIn both cases, the buyer financed the purchases with $14.3 million mortgages from City National Bank of Florida. The latest mortgage lists a mailing address as the Stuart location of Sherban Spine Institute, a spinal practice with eight locations throughout Florida, led by Dr. Ross Sherban. Sherban sold an Ocean Ridge home for\n$10.1 million\nin 2021.\nRothbaum founded New York City-based Quogue in 2001 with a focus on biotech investments, and is considered one of the most successful investors in that segment, according to\nForbes\n. He founded and invested in cancer drug developer Acerta Pharma, which later sold to AstraZeneca for $7 billion. His net worth today is $2.6 billion, according to Forbes.\nHe bought the 941 South Ocean Boulevard lot for $8.3 million in 2013, according to property records. It has 110 feet of beach frontage, according to a previous listing.\nRothbaum has ties to other\nDelray Beach\nproperties. In 2021, a Delaware entity linked to Quogue bought an oceanfront mansion at 855 South Ocean Boulevard for\n$34 million\n.Other recent deals in Delray Beach include digital marketing mogul Jeffrey Herzog\u2019s sale of his mansion for\n$23.5 million\nin May.",

        "content": "Nearly 60 percent of international homebuyers in California hail from Asia or Oceania, according to a new National Association of Realtors report.\nFifteen percent of foreign buyers who purchased a residential property in the U.S. bought in California,\nSF Gate\nreported, citing a new National Association of Realtors\nreport\n, which tracked data from last April to this March. Of those California buyers, 57 percent were from Asia or Oceania, followed by Latin America at 18 percent.\nHomebuyers from China led the way, accounting for 15 percent of the homes in the U.S. purchased by foreigners. California was the \u201ctop destination\u201d for Chinese buyers, according to the report.\n\u201cChinese buyers are drawn to California due to its proximity to China, business opportunities from moving to the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, and stronger cultural ties to the population in certain markets,\u201d Matt Christopherson, a business and consumer research director at the National Association of Realtors, told SF Gate. \u201cAdditionally, low affordability in California brings strong rental demand, presenting an opportunity for those investment buyers purchasing residential rentals.\u201d\n\nReal estate professionals saw a 33 percent increase in international clients compared to the year prior, according to the data cited by SF Gate. In total, buyers from outside the U.S. spent $56 billion on homes in the country from April 2024 to March 2025, gobbling up 34,400 homes, up from 23,300 the year before.\nAll-cash deals were especially popular among international buyers in the U.S. due in part to limited housing stock, currency exchange rates and stagnant mortgage rates, according to the report cited by SF Gate. During the April-to-March study period, 56 percent of international buyers bought homes in cash. That number was even higher among Chinese homebuyers, with 71 percent buying properties in cash at an average home price of $1.2 million.\nThe report aligns with\nanecdotal evidence from Bay Area real state agents\nwho recently told the\nSan Francisco Business Times\nabout their changing client base.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Multifamily syndicator Rise48 Equity is following a familiar playbook with its latest transaction in a suburb northeast of Dallas.\nThe Arizona-based firm purchased a 248-unit apartment complex at 2379 Apollo Road in Garland, Bisnow\nreported\n. The sale price wasn\u2019t disclosed, but the firm said it was a 30 percent discount to the property\u2019s value a few years ago. It was an off-market transaction without competition, the firm\u2019s co-founder and CEO Zach Haptonstall said.\nThe seller was Redondo Beach, California-based Wedgewood, which had 86 percent ownership, along with entities named GDD Holdings and West Ridge Rentals, according to property tax records. The complex was valued for tax purposes this year at $32.8 million, or $132,000 per unit. One- and two-bedroom apartments in the complex are advertised online for about $1,200 to $1,700 a month.\nThe buyer plans to renovate 88 percent of units at the Shiloh Oaks Apartments and rebrand the property as Rise Apollo Heights. The firm\u2019s \u201cvalue-add\u201d plans for the 40-year-old complex include adding in-unit washers and dryers and stainless-steel appliances, as well as updating the lighting, plumbing and fixtures. Landscaping, exterior paint and renovations to the pool and clubhouse are also planned.\nHaptonstall founded the firm in 2019, and it deals primarily in Phoenix and Dallas. It focuses on acquiring, renovating and reselling value-add apartments.\n\nFloating-rate debt put some multifamily syndicators in distress a few years ago, following interest-rate hikes. In November 2023, $256 million in debt tied to Rise48 buildings was\nwatchlisted\n, according to Trepp and Morningstar Credit. The loans tied to that debt accounted for seven Phoenix-area assets comprising over 1,700 units. However, Rise48\ndisputed that it was in distress\n.\nThe firm acquired at least three DFW multifamily properties last year.\nOne of them was a 144-unit apartment complex at 2929 Kings Road on the edge of Dallas\u2019 Oaklawn and Park Cities neighborhoods, which it bought\nwith a $21 million loan\n. The debt amounted to $145,800 per unit.\n\u2014Eric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Cirrus Real Estate and LCOR want to take over the remaining railyard development sites at Pacific Park, as well as a separate property known as Site 5.\nDuring a meeting on Wednesday, Empire State Development confirmed the developers submitted an application to be designated as a \u201cpermitted\u201d developer of six railyard sites in the long-stalled Brooklyn megadevelopment. The development rights were supposed to be transferred to a new team, approved by ESD, by Aug. 1, with millions of dollars of late fees on the line. Now, the deadline has once again been extended.\nESD officials indicated that Greenland, the current Pacific Park developer, along with the U.S. Immigration Fund and Fortress Investment Group, would be part of the joint venture with Cirrus and LCOR, but would not have an active role in managing the development. Their involvement would be financial, based on their previous investments in the development sites, the officials said.\nCirrus and LCOR are also applying to take over Site 5, home to a former Modell\u2019s and a P.C. Richard &amp; Son near the Barclays Center. Greenland, which currently controls Site 5, would also remain part of that joint venture.\nPrevious\nplans for the site included two office towers, and Greenland has also proposed housing on the site. The Modell\u2019s space is currently\nbeing used\nfor a youth basketball training facility.\nPacific Park was supposed to be done by now. Thanks to a 2014 agreement with the city, Greenland was on the hook to finish the project\u2019s 2,250 affordable apartments by the end of May 2025. Failing to do so meant the developer would need to pay millions of dollars in fines.\nWith 876 affordable units yet to be built and no platform over the train tracks to accommodate the development, Greenland did not meet the deadline. In\nMay, the state\nannounced\nthat it would not fine Greenland. Instead, ESD set new deadlines\nAs part of the new deadlines, ESD pledged to approve the new development team for the railyard site by Aug. 1, but officials said Wednesday that the team\u2019s application for Site 5 extended the amount of time the agency needs for its review. Officials now say they are hoping to approve the development team by the end of September.\n\nESD\u2019s Arden Sokolow said Greenland has challenged the enforceability of the fines, arguing that it has faced \u201cunavoidable delays.\u201d Sokolow indicated that imposing the fines at this point could result in litigation and disrupt the project just as a new development team is poised to take over.\nAccording to the new parameters set by the state, the development team must have a \u201cfeasible\u201d project framework and new timeline for taking the project through public review.\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported that\nCirrus\nand\nLCOR\nwere preparing to take over the site. ESD needs to sign off on the replacement developers for the platform sites, as well as Site 5.\nThe development rights for the railyard sites still need to be officially transferred through a foreclosure auction. In 2022, Greenland\ndefaulted\non $350 million worth of loans tied to the sites from Nick Mastroianni\u2019s U.S. Immigration Fund, which raised the capital through the cash-for-visas EB-5 program. Fortress Investment Group also owns a stake in the debt.\nPacific Park, formerly known as Atlantic Yards, was first\nannounced\nmore than 20 years ago. The project faced years of litigation, construction mishaps and financial hardships, in the form of global economic crises and distress within the balance sheets of the development firms leading the project.\nCirrus\u2019 portfolio of projects has grown rapidly in the past year. Last year, Cirrus reached a deal with the Building and Construction Trades Council and City Hall to invest in multifamily workforce housing and redevelopments by pooling pension funds from more than a dozen construction unions. Since then, the company has also announced that it will partner with Resorts World Casino New York City to build 50,000 housing units over the next 20 years. Last week, the city\ntapped\nCirrus and LCOR to build 3,000 housing units at a former airport in Queens.\n",

        "content": "Masoud and Stephanie Shojaee\u2019s Shoma Group secured nearly $30 million in financing for its planned North Bay Village condo project.\nCoral Gables-based Shoma obtained a predevelopment loan from Forman Capital for Shoma Bay, according to a press release. The $29.9 million loan will be used to pay off an existing loan that\u2019s backed by the property at 1872 79th Street Causeway.\nShoma Bay will be a 24-story, 333-unit luxury condo building with a 36,068-square-foot Publix Supermarket on the ground floor, as well as another 15,628 square feet of ground-floor retail.\nThe building is more than 30 percent presold with about $97 million in presales, according to the release. Units start in the $800,000s. Craig Studnicky\u2019s ISG World is handling sales of the project.\nAmenities will include a rooftop pool deck with cabanas and an outdoor kitchen; a golf simulator and virtual reality gaming; a fitness center and spa.\nIn July, Shoma Group CEO Masoud Shojaee\nreceived an extra month\nto secure a master building permit for Shoma Bay. Shoma now has until Halloween to secure the permit.\nThe deadline was previously set for Aug. 30. The commission voted 4 to 1 to amend the development agreement. Shoma wasn\u2019t able to obtain a master permit due to\nmillions of dollars in fees\nowed to the village, the South Florida Business Journal reported earlier this year.\nShoma\u2019s attorney, Mario Garcia-Serra, suggested that the developer may seek another amendment to increase the project density by 53 units, from 119 units per acre to 150 units per acre. The height could increase about 40 feet, or four additional stories.\n\nThe Shojaees plan to live in one of the penthouses, according to a press release issued last year about the groundbreaking.\nThe units in the tower, as currently approved, range from 344-square-foot studios to 2,700-square-foot, three-bedroom condos, plus 10 townhouses.\nShoma\npaid about $16 million\nfor the site in May 2022, with plans for a rental apartment tower and retail development anchored by Publix. North Bay Village approved the project that year.\nBut Shoma changed course to build condos instead of rentals, a strategy that a handful of other developers have deployed as multifamily projects have been too costly to build.\nThe project\u2019s estimated completion date is now the end of 2027. It was previously the first quarter of 2027, Shojaee said at the July meeting.\nDevelopment is heating up in the village. At the same commission meeting last month, a joint venture between the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related Group and Harry Macklowe Properties secured approval for their planned two-tower luxury condo development. It will include two 498-foot, 43-story waterfront buildings at 8000 East Drive and 7946 East Drive.\nThe\nEichner\nfamily\u2019s Continuum Company plans to redevelop the former Shuckers-anchored property, now called the Palm Tree Club, into more than 500 condos, 200 hotel rooms and a marina.\nThe largest planned development is the Ansin family\u2019s phased project that includes land north and south of the 79th Street Causeway, which bisects the town.",

        "content": "Los Angeles County has unveiled its plan to help rebuild unincorporated areas torched by\nwildfires\nearly this year.\nThe new\nL.A. County Forward: Blueprint for Rebuilding\nplan details how officials and residents can rebuild in a low-cost, streamlined approach to recovery efforts,\nL.A. Business First\nreported. The outline is designed for the county to create an \u201cequitable reconstruction\u201d process and better support rebuilding residents in unincorporated areas as their properties emerge from the ashes.\nAs part of the city of Los Angeles, the Pacific Palisades has relied on the city for permits and other hurdles to rebuilding. But residents of unincorporated areas affected by the fires, such as Altadena in the Eaton burn zone and Sunset Mesa between the Palisades and Malibu, have to go through the county instead.\nThe plan emphasizes six priorities for the county that officials believe are paramount to rebuilding. They include streamlining permitting resources, reducing building costs, restoring critical infrastructure, mobilizing a stronger workforce, expanding the pool of builders and bringing back public assets and services.\nThe county is looking to support a \u201cfeasible financial path\u201d forward through unlocking financial support for families and businesses and lowering upfront construction costs by directing homeowners to affordable rebuilding plans and contractors. Additionally, homeowners will receive more than $50 million in direct relief funding.\nL.A. County also intends to waive certain non-life-threatening requirements, such as temporary pauses on new rules for rooftop solar\u00a0 and other efficiency standards that will help simplify rebuilding. The local government is also expediting reviews for like-for-like rebuilds and will allow self-inspections for licensed architects and engineers, open one-stop permitting centers and provide new technological tools to streamline approvals.\n\n\u201cAs we turn the page from recovery to rebuilding, we\u2019re doing it with a clear plan, strong partnerships, and the urgency this moment demands,\u201d Gov. Gavin Newsom\nsaid\nof the findings. \u201cThis report creates a step-by-step guide to accelerate rebuilding and provide support to impacted families.\u201d\nLos Angeles County Board of Supervisors Chair Kathryn Barger, who represents residents in the Eaton fire burn zone, said in a\nstatement\nthat the plan is \u201can essential roadmap forward\u201d that marks \u201ca shift from debris removal to reconstruction that will help residents and businesses navigate the path home with greater clarity and support.\u201d\n\u201cThis blueprint shows what\u2019s possible when multiple levels of government, private industry, philanthropy and community partners come together with urgency to facilitate large-scale solutions,\u201d Barger said.\nTo date, Los Angeles County has issued 164 rebuilding permits in the affected areas, including 148 in the Eaton fire burn zone and 16 in the Palisades area, according to the county\u2019s\npermitting progress dashboard\n.\nThe county and its partners plan to use the report\u2019s guidance over the next 120 days. Next steps include planning for more than 150 miles of infrastructure lines for electricity, gas and telecommunications.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The Milligan clan sold a massive Ventura County site that has been in limbo for decades to Hearthstone for $59.4 million, according to property records and a source involved in the project.\nThe price for the 271-acre site amounts to $219,200 per acre.\nThe vacant nine-parcel deal for Hitch Ranch in Moorpark, a city about 50 miles northwest of Downtown Los Angeles, includes a purchase option agreement with Lennar.\nHearthstone, an investor in residential development, will finance and complete the land development, and then sell the lots to homebuilders, including Comstock and Lennar, to erect 755 homes, said Debra Geiler, vice president of entitlements and forward planning for Comstock.\nEl Segundo-based development firm Comstock Homes has had control of the site via a private agreement with the Milligan family for about 10 years, Geiler said. The firm took the project through its entitlement process and then sold its interest to Hearthstone.\nNow Comstock and Lennar are focused on architectural review and compliance with the specific plan, and before moving on to permitting of the housing.\nHitch Ranch doesn\u2019t have an address, but it\u2019s located in Moorpark, a city of roughly 36,000 people, \u201cnorth of Poindexter Avenue, west of Casey Road, and extending approximately 1,700 feet to the west of Gabbert Road,\u201d according to the Moorpark community development department\u2019s website.\n\nThe site was once a hillside for grazing and farming. Its namesake is Archibald Hitch, whose\nfamily migrated\nfrom Tennessee in the early 1900s and farmed apricots and lemons on the site, according to project material.\nDifferent versions of the project have been bandied about for over 30 years, according to Doug Spondello, community development director for the City of Moorpark, who reviews entitlement requests like those for Hitch Ranch.\nComstock filed its initial plans with the city in 2019, and the final environmental impact report was approved by the Moorpark City Council in June 2022.\nProposed housing types at Hitch Ranch include multifamily, smaller single-family starter homes, larger-lot single families and move-up housing. Fifteen percent of the 755 homes will be allocated for affordable housing, Spondello said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a project that envisioned housing affordability in every category,\u201d Geiler said.\nIn addition to the 755 homes, Hitch Ranch is slated to include a 6-acre public park, open space, associated roadways and infrastructure.\nHitch Ranch isn\u2019t the only big development underway in Moorpark.\nAdjacent to Hitch Ranch is developer James Rasmussen\u2019s 68-acre North Ranch, a project slated to have 134 detached single-family homes, five 5-acre estate homesites, and 20 affordable homes.\n",

Arbor purchased the resort from an affiliate of AllianceBernstein, which had taken over the property in 2022 to resolve a distressed $29 million mortgage.\nThe price was probably below the outstanding loan balance due to declining property values at a time of rising interest rates, the outlet reported. Jones Lang LaSalle\u2019s Adam McGaughy and John Nugent brokered the sale.\nThe acquisition signals a strategic pivot for Arbor, which typically invests in traditional urban hotels. Eaglewood has a 295-room hotel that caters to corporate guests but also includes unique features such as a championship golf course, a spa, a bowling alley and 39,000 square feet of meeting space. It is Arbor\u2019s first venture into golf resort ownership, reflecting broader industry trends since the pandemic.\nGolf courses, once seen as money-losing assets, have become profitable as participation in the sport has surged. Arbor CEO Vamsi Bonthala described Eaglewood as a \u201cunique and irreplaceable asset\u201d with significant potential to grow as a destination for corporate meetings and events.\n\nArbor\u2019s interest in golf comes shortly after the company sold its Hampton Inn/Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago at a steep loss compared to its 2018 purchase price, underscoring the financial pressures faced by urban hotels in the post-pandemic era.\nIn contrast, Bonthala is optimistic about suburban hospitality assets like Eaglewood, especially given their accessibility and appeal to corporate groups seeking in-person gatherings. He emphasized the resort\u2019s proximity to O\u2019Hare Airport and the suburbs north and west of Chicago strategic advantages.\nThe purchase also reflects a growing trend of non-traditional investors \u2014 such as hotel operators and private equity firms \u2014 entering the golf industry, driving up property values. Arbor financed the acquisition with a loan, though details were not disclosed.\nOriginally built in 1971 and expanded in 2002, Eaglewood has a colorful history, including serving as a site for weight-loss retreats modeled on \u201cThe Biggest Loser.\u201d The resort had been owned by Denver-based Amstar until 2022, when it was turned over to AllianceBernstein.\n\u2014 Joel Russell",

        "content": "A poster child for Houston office distress is still bleeding even after it secured a lifeline earlier this summer.\nOne Riverway is losing law firm Wright Close &amp; Barger, which signed a 41,000-square-foot lease to occupy TC Energy Center, at 700 Louisiana Street in downtown Houston, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe firm is exiting 777 South Post Oak Lane in the Galleria. That 507,000-square-foot building has been\nscheduled for auction at least seven times\nin the last few years. Its owners, Israel-based Azrieli Group and Beverly Hills-based Unilev Capital, finally scored a recapitalization deal with lender German American Capital Corporation earlier this summer, Bisnow\nreported\n.\nThe deal includes a\nloan modification\nand additional equity with which the owners plan to renovate the common areas and build spec suites.\nBut it hasn\u2019t staunched the bleeding of the emptying building.\nThe law firm\u2019s exit frees up about 5 percent of the space at One Riverway. In 2024, the building lost Houston-based law firm Thompson, Coe, Cousins &amp; Irons, which leased 11 percent of the building.\n\nThe building was 51 percent occupied in December. The owners first fell behind on payments on the property\u2019s $80 million mortgage in June 2023.\nTC Energy Center is one of downtown Houston\u2019s most recognizable properties. Built in 1983, the 56-story, 1.5 million-square-foot tower is made of red granite and features a three-part gabled roof rising on an incline. It\u2019s owned by Houston-based M-M Properties.\nFounding partner Tom Wright called downtown \u201cthe heart of our legal community\u201d\nThe property was saved from default when the owner reached a deal with lender Starwood Property Trust to modify its $252 million mortgage last year, Houston Chronicle\nreported\n. The owner raised $30 million for renovations last year. The last round of updates took place in 2017 and cost about $20 million.\nPreviously the Bank of America Center, the building was renamed when TC Energy signed a lease in 2019.\n",

        "content": "The Midtown South rezoning was a test. What does this mean for future upzonings?\nThe City Council Land Use Committee and Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises on Wednesday advanced the 42-block rezoning, but trimmed 165 units from the original plan.\nThe changes that reduced the projected unit count were not as extensive as some had sought. The Council nodded to a request to reduce residential density in the southeast portion of the rezoning area, doing so within just four blocks. It also removed a high-density residential district from the northwestern portion, leaving it as a light manufacturing zone.\nThe carveouts, as explained by the Council members, were in response to concerns raised by the garment-related businesses (manufacturers and wholesalers) that they would be pushed out as owners opted to demolish their buildings to take advantage of the upzoning.\nThe result: Instead of an estimated 9,700 units, the rezoning is expected to net 9,500 over the next decade.\nThe changes were mostly surgical and didn\u2019t make a huge dent in the projected unit count. It is important to note that these projections are just that: projections. What ultimately gets built will depend on a number of factors; things like developer whim cannot be quantified in a review intended to estimate how many apartments are likely to be built.\nThe changes to the rezoning reduced the projected housing production by just 2 percent. Still, I wonder if this is the kind of change that would trigger action by an appeals board. The Charter Revision Commission has proposed creating one that could overrule land use actions by the City Council, including modifications to rezonings. It\u2019s a small reduction in housing, but a board might find that any reduction (within the city\u2019s power) is unacceptable.\nThe rezoning is the first to map two new residential districts, R11 and R12, that were created as part of the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity. The designations allow residential floor area ratios of 15 and 18, respectively.\nBack in 2023, when the city was still pushing the state to lift its residential FAR cap, land use hawks\nspeculated\non what areas of the city would likely be upzoned if the state were to act. At the time, one attorney pointed to Long Island City, Midtown, Downtown Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan as \u201clow-hanging fruit.\u201d The administration has opted not to pluck the first, capping residential FAR in the Long Island City rezoning at 12. As I\nnoted\nearlier this week, if the City Council had failed to map those districts at all in Midtown South, chances of doing so elsewhere would be killed.\nThe fact that the Council kept most of those districts intact in Midtown South doesn\u2019t necessarily open the floodgates. And the modifications may mean that rezonings elsewhere will also include carveouts. But approval of this first rezoning might give more momentum to proposals in other high-density areas.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: Where should the city try to map R11 and R12 districts next? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\n\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nFormer HFZ Capital Group exec Nir Meir was a subscriber to this newsletter. Court filings included an email to Meir\u2019s HFZ email with a September 2019 edition of The Daily Dirt attached. Meir, who is accused of orchestrating an $86 million fraud scheme, was\nreleased\nfrom Rikers in June after posting bail. Thank you to\nTRD\n\u2019s Keith Larsen for passing the newsletter tidbit along!\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 The Campaign Finance Board again denied Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 bid for matching funds,\nthe City\nreports. The board cited Adams\u2019 now-dismissed indictment and his failure to adequately respond to questions about hundreds of suspicious donations as reasons to deny the public funding.\n\u2014 NYC has opened the country\u2019s first city-funded homeless shelter for transgender and gender non-conforming people, according to\nGothamist\n. The Long Island City facility will have 150 beds and cost $65 million to operate through 2030.\n\u2014 City Hall officials greenlit a plan for a 34th Street busway after speculation that the project had been axed,\namNY\nreports. The project got the go-ahead as part of the Midtown South rezoning. The busway would improve bus speeds by up to 15% and support the residents of the nearly 10,000 new apartments that will result from the rezoning.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$20 million\nfor a 6,163-square-foot townhouse at 230 West 11th Street in Greenwich Village. The Eklund-Gomes Team at Douglas Elliman had\nthe listing.\nThe property last sold for\n$20 million\nin 2023.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$86 million\nfor a 34,3701-square-foot office building at 141 Willoughby Street in Downtown Brooklyn. The transaction included 383 Gold Street. Savanna Funds sold the properties to Capstone Equities.\nThe Real Deal\nreported on Savanna\u2019s foreclosure in June.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$18 million\nfor a 4,500-square-foot townhouse at 20 Charles Street in Greenwich Village. Adam Modlin and Andrew Nierenberg of The Modlin Group have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for a 269,062-square-foot, 282-unit project at 413 East 120th Street in East Harlem.

        "content": "Douglas Emmett is turning a Westwood office building to residences, the company announced during its second-quarter earnings call Wednesday.\nThe real estate investment trust reported that it plans to turn the office tower it purchased earlier in the year for $131 million from Tishman Speyer through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure into apartments, per its second-quarter earnings\nrelease\n.\nThe 17-story, 247,000-square-foot office tower at 10900 Wilshire Boulevard called Murdock Plaza combined with a residential building it plans to construct on the same site will become a 320-apartment complex with ample amenities in Westwood. The conversion will occur over an undisclosed number of years as offices are vacated on a floor-by-floor basis. The first apartments could be ready in the next 18 months, the company said.\n\u201cIncluding the costs to acquire the property, convert the existing office tower and construct the new building, we expect this plan to increase the total project costs to approximately $200 million to $250 million,\u201d Douglas Emmett said in the earnings release Tuesday.\n\nIn the first-quarter earnings\nrelease\n, the company reported that it expected the total project to cost $150 million to $200 million for the acquisition, construction of the apartment building on Ashton Avenue and upgrades to the existing tower. The firm estimated a timeframe of three to four years, but now, the ground-up development alone is estimated to take three years.\n\u201cWe expect this conversion will not only enhance the value of 10900 Wilshire, but will also reduce office vacancy in the submarket,\u201d Douglas Emmett CEO Jordan Kaplan\nsaid\non the earnings call. Westwood office vacancies were at about 19 percent, according to a CBRE first-quarter market report.\nDouglas Emmett is converting a 21-story building in Downtown Honolulu from offices to apartments.\nOverall, Douglas Emmett\u2019s revenues increased to $252 million in the second quarter compared to $246 million a year earlier due to an uptick in office and multifamily revenue. At the same time, losses escalated to $6 million. A year ago, the company reported $11 million in income.",

        "content": "Which way is Los Angeles residential\u2019s high end going?\nIt\u2019s hard to say and the latest data comprising the\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\nfrom Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team indicates a mixed bag. The report, which is compiled by the team\u2019s Marcy Roth, tallied 17 homes that went into contract last week, which equated to $126.9 million in asking dollar volume.\nThat\u2019s down from the 19 deals inked in the week prior and also off 2.5 percent in comparison to that same seven-day period\u2019s total asking dollar volume of $130.3 million.\nOn a year-over-year basis, which some would argue is the best gauge of change, last week\u2019s asking dollar volume reflected a 7 percent decline from the year-ago period\u2019s volume. But, there were four more deals last week compared to a year earlier.\nThe data for the report, which is pulled every Sunday, listed 1600 Casale Road in Pacific Palisades as the top home to go into contract with a list price just under $20 million.\nHowever, the property, which was listed as contingent last week, fell out of contract and went back on the market Monday for $1 million less than its last listing price as it looks to attract a buyer with the new ask of just under $19 million.\nA limited liability company named 1600 Casale and tied to Keith Natvig is the seller, according to property and state records.\nThe Agency\u2019s\nSantiago Arana\nand Compass\u2019 Craig Natvig, Keith\u2019s son, hold the listing.\n\nAt 9,000 square feet, the six-bedroom, 10-bathroom home in the Palisades\u2019 Riviera neighborhood \u2014 which was not as damaged by January\u2019s fire as other parts of the community \u2014 is decked out with Smart Home technology, Tesla Powerwall batteries, an EV charging station and solar panels. It\u2019s also relatively new after construction on the gated home was completed last year.\nLast week\u2019s second home to go into contract was 10694 Somma Way in Bel Air, which is listed for $15.8 million. It was first listed in January for nearly $20 million.\nCompass\u2019\nTracy Tutor\nand Thea Sheinberg hold the listing.\nThe home was built by the Rizzoli family, whose namesake publishing business is behind the coffee table books sitting in many a Los Angeles mansion and beyond. Rizzoli also happens to be the publisher of the late\nHilton &amp; Hyland\nco-founder Jeff Hyland\u2019s book \u201cThe Legendary Estates of Beverly Hills.\u201d\nThe estate is now owned by a trust tied to husband and wife David and April Tausik, according to the deed on the property.\nThe eight-bed, 11-bath home spans over 11,000 square feet on a 3.3-acre lot that keeps it hidden from view of the street and visitors to the nearby Hotel Bel-Air.\nThe property includes a mother-in-law apartment with its own entrance, a primary suite with a laundry chute and safe in the closet, library, bar, air filtration system, solar panels and Tesla Powerwalls. Outside, there\u2019s a tennis court, pool, outdoor kitchen, fruit orchard, paths for hiking and chicken coop.\n",

A second building depends on securing more power. The project could generate over $3 million in annual property taxes, with no added load on school districts, Whitaker said.\nBut some city officials are tapping the brakes over concerns about electricity and water consumption, which have become flashpoints as suburbs from Hoffman Estates to Aurora court similar projects. Karis countered that water use will be lower than that of the previous 600,000-square-foot office building, which was demolished in 2023, and that Naperville\u2019s grid can handle the first building.\n\nThe city council greenlit a $42,000 electric load study, funded by Karis.\nThe data center project would also include Class A office space for 70 on-site employees. The office square-footage wasn\u2019t reported.\nThe development follows a regional trend, as former suburban corporate campuses are repurposed for data centers, as municipalities adapt to declining demand for office space by allowing large properties to be redeveloped for industrial uses.\nThat includes the 2.4 million-square-foot former Sears headquarters in Hoffman Estates, which is being demolished to make way for a data center project by Compass Datacenters.\nElk Grove Village has already emerged as a significant Chicagoland data center market, and Hoffman Estates is following suit, with big names like Microsoft receiving approval for data center facilities in the area.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

        "content": "One piece of a funding jigsaw puzzle for an ambitious sports and entertainment district in downtown San Antonio, which could include a new stadium for the San Antonio Spurs, was punted to voters this week.\nThe Bexar County Commissioners Court sent the issue to a vote on the November ballot, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported.\nCommissioner Grant Moody voted against the referendum, in a 4-1 vote.\nShould voters approve the measure, it could raise $500 million in visitor tax revenue for the renovation of the Frost Bank Center, the current home of the Spurs, as well as to work on redeveloping the grounds of the Freeman Coliseum. Bexar County would contribute 25 percent of the cost of the new arena and no more than $311 million to the project.\nSpurs Sports and Entertainment Chairman and Managing Partner Peter J. Holt recently pledged $1 billion toward the projects: at least $500 million for the new arena, $500 million for adjacent development and $60 million for community incentives, per a letter sent to city officials\nlast week.\nThe Spurs also pledged to cover cost overruns.\n\nThe organization is seeking matching funds from the city and county to fund not just the new arena \u2014 estimated to clock in upwards of $1.2 billion \u2014 but also expanding the convention center, building a 1,000 room hotel, redeveloping the John Wood Federal Courthouse into a 5,000 seat entertainment venue, upgrading the Alamodome, and building a land bridge between complexes over Interstate 37.\nThe commissioners\u2019 move comes after the San Antonio City Council tapped into a state mechanism in May that could funnel up to $2 billion in state hotel tax revenue over 30 years into a broader sports and entertainment district.\nThe council dissolved a previous Project Finance Zone that excluded a new arena and required near-term work on the convention center and Alamodome. Establishing a new one that includes those areas gives the city more flexibility, requiring only one of the three core projects to start construction within five years.\n\u2014Eric Weilbacher\n",

That marks one of the biggest quarterly occupancy losses of any industrial market in the country last quarter.\nAs it stands, the I.E.\u2019s industrial vacancy rate is at a 15-year high of 8.5 percent, according to CoStar, above the nationwide industrial vacancy rate of 7.5 last quarter.\nIn response, landlords have begun offering rent concessions and focusing on lease renewals and marketing attractive top-tier properties.\nThe sharp increase in vacancy \u201cpresents an interesting dilemma for landlords,\u201d Monique Snowden, vice president of asset management at CapRock Partners, told CoStar. CapRock owns 35 industrial properties in the region. Some landlords could consider \u201celevated tenant credit risk\u201d to fill space while others could negotiate cheaper rents when renewing existing tenants\u2019 leases, Snowden said.\nIt\u2019\u2019s not all doom and gloom in the I.E. industrial sector, though.\n\nDedeaux Properties, which owns and manages 14 million square feet in the region, recently locked down a full 165,000-square-foot warehouse lease in Fontana with logistics firm Pilot Air Freight. Last week, IDC Logistics\nleased nearly 1 million square feet\nin one of the I.E.\u2019s largest industrial leases of the year so far.\n\u201cWe recognize we\u2019re in a slow leasing environment,\u201d Alex Filler, senior director of investments at Dedeaux, said. \u201cBut even with all the macro items in the background, we were able to lease at market rates and get really-good-credit tenants into our buildings.\u201d He added that hesitant tenants are \u201cwaiting on interest rates, watching consumer spending and tariffs.\u201d\nAn increase in warehouse and logistics facility construction during the pandemic could be to blame for the current lack of demand to fill the space.\n\u201cMuch of the current rise in vacancies is a correction from the pandemic-era demand surge and record-breaking construction deliveries,\u201d Snowden said. \u201cThis cycle will take time to work through, but I have no doubts about the resilience in the Inland Empire.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The rental market in San Francisco has almost entirely recovered from its pandemic losses.\nMedian rental prices for two-bedroom apartments in San Francisco have surpassed levels before the pandemic\u2019s outbreak, which led to a price dropoff in 2020 and stagnant recovery in the following four years, according to data from\nZumper\ncited by the\nSan Francisco Examiner\n.\nIn July, two-bedrooms in the city rose to a monthly median listing price of $4,780, the highest such level since August 2019. Median rents for one-bedrooms, meanwhile, have almost completely recovered at $3,400, just under the pre-pandemic level of $3,500.\nAn influx of new tech workers, likely driven by the proliferation of\nartificial intelligence company offices\nin the city,\nplayed a key part\nin the recent increase, according to Zumper spokesperson Crystal Chen.\n\u201cWith high-earning renters competing for limited inventory, especially near job centers, rent growth is accelerating and showing few signs of slowing in the near term,\u201d Chen told the Examiner.\nIncreasing return-to-office rates could also play a role in more workers needing housing in San Francisco, according to the Examiner. Earlier this year, the city\nclawed its way out of last place\nin return-to-office rates across the country.\n\nHigher-end apartments in the city\u2019s most desirable neighborhoods have seen the greatest price increases.\n\u201cMission Bay, [South of Market], Hayes Valley and Civic Center all saw rents grow in the double digits annually,\u201d Chen said. \u201cDemand in these pockets has risen so much because they are near where offices are typically located, close to the city\u2019s downtown area.\u201d\nRental rates in San Francisco bottomed out in 2020 in the months after nationwide Covid-related shutdowns. Between February 2020 and 2021, median rents for two-bedroom apartments tumbled 24 percent.\n\u201c2020 was an absolute disaster,\u201d Inna Rubinchik, a San Francisco-based leasing agent with Compass who specializes in the luxury rental market, told the Examiner. \u201cPeople had left, and there was so much vacancy.\u201d\nThat, in turn, has made it easy for landlords to find tenants willing to pay whatever price necessary to get the keys to an apartment. \u201cThose properties, you can ask for anything at this point,\u201d Rubinchik said. \u201cYou could just pull the number out of the blue sky, and you will get it.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

He\u2019s teaming up on the deal with childhood friend Justin Gruenberg. The pair moved quickly, reportedly signing a contract within a week of touring the home.\nTMZ first\nreported\nthe transaction. Should the deal close at the expected price, the sale would break down to $1,932 per square foot.\nThe 4,400-square-foot traditional-style home, built by Vault Development Partners and designed by architect Brian Glasser, is being rented by David Zander, a Los Angeles-based producer known for pricey, trophy home buys.\nZander, who co-founded production firm MJZ, sold Jackie O\u2019s childhood home, Lasata, in 2023 for $52 million, then followed it with an $86 million splurge on Rod Stewart\u2019s former L.A. estate earlier this year.\nThe East Hampton home features a pool, pool house, covered terraces, a one-car garage and luxe finishes, including a sink said to have once belonged to Billy Joel. Flagg is expected to give the home a more \u201ctraditional\u201d look with renovations aimed at making it feel a century old.\nIts layout includes a grand foyer leading to a great room with 38-foot accordion doors, chef and prep kitchens, a junior primary suite on the ground floor and a main bedroom with private balcony upstairs. The lower level features a rec room with wine storage, two guest bedrooms and a laundry room.\n\nThe property, on a half-acre lot, was originally listed last year for $10.85 million and last asked $9.15 million before going into contract.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Martha Gundersen and Paul Brennan have the\nlisting\n.\nFlagg, summering in a Sagaponack rental while recovering from a whirlwind trip to the South of France, is planning a birthday bash with a guest list that includes Candy Spelling.\nHis Hamptons home purchase comes months after his Flagg Family Capital venture, alongside Andrew Aryeh and David Elbez, picked up retail space at 170 Mercer Street in SoHo in a Christmas Eve closing.\nLast month, the Compass broker\ndropped his former Douglas Elliman boss\nfrom a lawsuit he filed last year over claims that someone accessed and shared his private information.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Sussman and Laurel Sussman last fall for $8.3 million, property records show. On Friday, the estate sold the second unit, penthouse 5102, to an undisclosed buyer for $9.5 million. The two sales total $17.8 million.\nIn April 2021, Minerd, who was chief investment officer of the New York and Chicago-based global investment giant,\npaid $12.5 million\nfor the two units. Together they would total 22,547 square feet, including 16,312 square feet of interior space, and have two swimming pools and 12 parking spaces.\n\nThe developer,\nTwo Roads Development\n, sold the condos at the time. The 51-story, 391-unit bayfront\nBiscayne Beach\nwas completed in 2017.\nThe condos were part of Minerd\u2019s fortune, which was estimated at $400 million around the time of his late 2022 death, the result of a heart attack while working out, according to the\nNew York Times\n. His sudden death at age 63 ignited a fight over his estate. Minerd was married to actor and producer Eloy Mendez.\nBill Hernandez and Bryan Sereny of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Bill and Bryan Team brokered the 2021 purchase, and also listed the units for Minerd\u2019s estate. Coldwell Banker\u2019s Danny Hertzberg represented the buyer of unit 5101. Redfin agent Cecilia Jakubowycz represented the buyer in the latest deal, the sale of unit 5202.\nPenthouse 5202 has six bedrooms, eight bathrooms and spans 8,434 square feet, according to the listing.\nHernandez of Elliman said his client \u201cwanted to make one of the greatest penthouses ever,\u201d and called the latest sale bittersweet. \u201cI\u2019m sad he never got to do what he wanted to do,\u201d he said.\n",

        "content": "An investor who has made Chicago multifamily deals with embattled real estate attorney Mark Nussbaum is at risk of losing a chunk of his portfolio to financial distress.\nNew York-based Eliazer Tauber, a landlord of dozens of small to midsize apartment complexes on Chicago\u2019s South Side, operated by Straightline Management, is facing at least nine foreclosure lawsuits on buildings that he purchased for far more than the appraised values set by property tax officials.\nThe Straightline portfolio includes hundreds of Chicago apartments, many of which Nussbaum and Tauber appear to have purchased together, sometimes at prices that make little sense, given the need for major renovations and construction work on the properties.\nWhile Nussbaum has served real estate clients as a lawyer, he also became a fast-acting lender to help multifamily buyers show they had funds to close transactions. Some of his clients, however, got their real estate businesses caught up in a mortgage fraud scheme that involved selling properties between related parties in order to score bigger loans, often for more than what the collateral was worth.\nNussbaum then began buying Chicago apartment buildings that were in rough shape as a white knight, saving the previous owners from facing foreclosures or city building code violation cases.\nNow, financial distress is engulfing Tauber, a fellow landlord with whom Nussbaum appeared to work closely. Tauber has signed multiple loans on behalf of Nussbaum\u2019s entities. He and his son Jacob Tauber were Nussbaum\u2019s known deal partners on Chicago multifamily properties through Straightline, according to people familiar with the investors.\nThe foreclosures on Tauber come as Nussbaum is under indictment in New York for grand larceny for allegedly bilking investors out of at least $15 million in escrow deposits meant for real estate deals.\nNussbaum hasn\u2019t been directly tied to the ownership for Tauber\u2019s apartment buildings now facing foreclosure. But he looks to have been a key part of investments for South Side multifamily players now on the brink of financial danger, including Tauber and Yissocher \u201cIzzy\u201d Rotenberg, who sold multiple buildings to Tauber before a big portion of Rotenberg\u2019s 500-unit Chicago portfolio got dragged into foreclosure.\nClose looks at their deals show the wave of distress that could be coming for other investors in the South Side linked to Nussbaum. Many appear to follow a similar playbook of buying properties at low prices, flipping them to related parties at high prices and taking on bigger and bigger loans. This strategy is coming crashing down just as Nussbaum\u2019s many escrow clients are seeking to get repaid.\nThe foreclosure cases totaling 29 units are now hitting Tauber, who bought the properties for nearly $5 million total between December 2023 and May 2024.\nTauber borrowed nearly $4 million from New York-based Ark Mortgage to complete the purchases, and the loans often came at interest rates of more than 8 percent for the borrower. He\u2019s been involved in the purchase of larger buildings with Nussbaum-led entities that employ Straightline Management as their operator, as well.\nSilver Hill Capital, based in Coral Gables, Florida, as well as Wilmington Trust acquired the mortgage notes originated by Ark and are now moving to foreclose on Tauber\u2019s property.\nAttorneys for Nussbaum and the lenders didn\u2019t return requests for comment, and neither did Jacob Tauber nor Straightline.\nThe Chicago Housing Authority last year suspended Straightline from its housing choice voucher program, meaning it wasn\u2019t allowed to make new leases with tenants whose rents are mostly subsidized by the federal government for at least a year, according to public records obtained by\nThe Real Deal\n. Suspensions are most commonly triggered by a landlord having multiple units fail the CHA\u2019s Housing Quality Standards, meant to keep apartments from falling into disrepair. Unit failures can allow tenant leases to be terminated early.\n\nStraightline was one of more than 200 companies currently debarred from the program as of May, and Straightline was required to serve a one-year suspension that was scheduled to end earlier this summer. To lift the suspension, Straightline was required to attend a property management course with an approved trainer and gain a certificate of completion; it\u2019s unclear whether Straightline has been reinstated to the authority\u2019s housing assistance program.\nWhile the authority\u2019s landlord guide says suspensions aren\u2019t common, several owners have been suspended for various reasons in recent years, including for failing to get units into compliance within the Housing Choice Voucher program\u2019s housing quality standards requirements.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Tauber\u2019s apartments now in foreclosure were subject to the suspension \u2014 some landlords are able to protect certain portions of their portfolios from Chicago Housing Authority enforcement by using separate vendor numbers issued by the agency for each building, officials said. \u201cIf the vendor uses multiple vendor IDs, CHA\u2019s treatment would vary on a case-by-case basis,\u201d a spokesperson for the agency said.\nStraightline listed 97 units owned and 47 occupied through the CHA program. It\u2019s unknown whether Straightline, Tauber or Nussnaum has additional CHA vendor IDs that have avoided suspensions.\nHere are the properties where Tauber is facing foreclosure from Silver Hill and Wilmington:\n9130 South Throop Street\n8017 South Hermitage Avenue\n5226 South Paulina Street\n8052 South Langley Avenue\n8047 South Vernon Avenue\n5621 South Green Street\n7944 South Eberhart Avenue\n7938 South Langley Avenue\n7937 South Eberhart Avenue\n",

        "content": "Another planned office development in the Bay Area is pivoting to housing as demand for office space lags.\nVancouver, Canada-based developer Westbank has revised its plans for a development in downtown San Jose,\nThe Mercury News\nreported. The new proposal, submitted to the city\u2019s Planning Department, calls for 391 housing units next to a data center at 180 Park Avenue as part of Westbank\u2019s Park Habitat development.\nThe housing would rise next to The Tech Interactive museum on a site previously set aside for an office tower. The plan is the latest iteration of proposals from Westbank over the past year that call for the construction of apartments and a data center in downtown San Jose.\n\u201cOur entire San Jose initiative is based on the premise that the best placement for housing is in central urban locations that are walkable and offer proximity to amenities, transit and workplaces,\u201d Andrew Jacobson, vice president of the U.S. for Westbank, told The Mercury News. \u201cPark Habitat aligns perfectly with that strategy\u2026 We\u2019re building on the idea that great cities don\u2019t have business districts or residential districts; rather they are all intermixed.\u201d\nWith the increased strain on the power grid that\nartificial intelligence\nand other new technologies bring, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric is looking to\nupgrade\nits electricity systems in San Jose and other parts of the Bay Area. Westbank\u2019s data center would\ncapture the waste heat\nfrom the facility to provide low-cost, low-carbon energy to nearby residents, Jacobson said.\n\nElsewhere in San Jose, last August, Westbank swapped out an approved plan for a 14-story office building at 255 West Julian Street in downtown San Jose for an\n18-story residential tower\n. Soon thereafter, it revised plans submitted in 2022 to switch from a\n750,000-square-foot tower\nat 35 South 2nd Street with 194 apartments and 368,000 square feet of offices to 768 housing units and 10,700 square feet of ground-floor retail.\nOther Bay Area projects to replace offices with housing include a planned\nredevelopment at Bishop Ranch\nin San Ramon, a\nTrammell Crow-led project\nin Walnut Creek, and Align Real Estate\u2019s plans to\nturn offices into homes in Livermore\n.\nOffice vacancy in downtown San Jose was 28.9 percent in the second quarter, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s Q2\nreport\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Portions of the space have been used to house more than 3,000 asylum seekers.\n\nThe lease for the health and hospital system expired in March.\nRXR acquired the property in 2016 for more than $160 million but was forced to pause in the middle of renovations after the onset of the pandemic.

It also has more than 300,000 square feet of offices.\nVornado bought the 39-story building for $118 million in 1998, when the company was then headquartered in Saddle Brook, N.J., and just gaining a toehold in Manhattan. A spokesperson for the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe A&amp;D Building is the latest offering from Vornado, which is becoming increasingly open to doing deals.\n\nIn May, the company and its partner the Albanese Organization went into contract to sell the West Chelsea office building at 512 West 22nd Street to Raghsa Real Estate, a subsidiary of Argentinian developer Mois\u00e9s Khafif\u2019s Raghsa SA, for\n$205 million\n.\nAnd on Vornado\u2019s earnings call Tuesday, Roth said the company is open to offers on two of its biggest office buildings: the Merchandise Mart in Chicago and 555 California Street in San Francisco.\nRoth said the company isn\u2019t going to actively market the towers for sale, but said he would be willing to part ways if the price was right.\n\u201cThose two assets we will sell for the right price at the right timing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not sacred.

The investigations stemmed from a 2018 lawsuit that alleged such control led to racial segregation and dampened affordable housing development in wealthy, predominately white neighborhoods, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nCity Council members from white neighborhoods have historically resisted racially integrated public housing since the 1930s, the 2018\ncomplaint said\n. Developers still rely heavily on blessings by local aldermen to secure zoning changes and city subsidies for affordable projects, a system critics say reinforces segregation.\nThe city had already entered a voluntary agreement to negotiate a resolution after federal housing authorities found merit in the claims. Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s administration was reportedly near an agreement at the end of last year, but negotiations tapered off after Trump took office.\nIt is unprecedented for HUD to walk away from enforcing the Fair Housing Act, said Patricia Fron, executive director at the Chicago Area Fair Housing Alliance.\n\nThe lawsuit and investigation \u201cdemonstrated that decades of discriminatory decision-making have led to the loss of affordable housing in Chicago,\u201d Fron told the outlet. \u201cSo the fact that HUD is now retracting this, when we rely on HUD to enforce these protections, is really a gut punch for us and for the people who have been harmed.\u201d\nJohnson\u2019s office disagreed with the decision and said it will\u00a0 work with allies to push for \u201creforms that make it easier to build and maintain affordable housing across our city.\u201d\nHousing advocates worry, however, that more comprehensive measures are unlikely to move forward without the leverage of federal oversight.\n\u2014Eric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "In order to secure crucial City Council approvals, Northwell Health just scaled down its proposed rezoning of an Upper East Side block needed to expand Lenox Hill Hospital.\nNorthwell on Wednesday agreed to reduce the size of an originally proposed 436-foot tower to 370 feet, leading the proposal to unanimously pass the Council\u2019s land use committee and zoning subcommittee. This reduction followed community complaints about the size of the building and timeline of construction,\nCrain\u2019s New York\nreported.\nThe project will include 475 single-bed rooms, expand the emergency room and build a mother-baby unit. Additionally, the new proposal will require eight years of construction, shaving a year off the original timeline.\nLenox Hill\u2019s current campus spans an entire city block from Park to Lexington Avenue, between 76th and 77th streets, with some of the facilities dating back to the 19th century.\nThe hospital has spent\nfive years\nin a standoff with a local community group that pushed back against the $2 billion\nredevelopment\n. The size reduction of the medical tower is the latest in a series of reductions that lowered the scale of the project; it was originally supposed to be 516 feet tall and include a now-scrapped residential tower.\n\nAlthough the plans have been revised to scale down the size and adjust the construction schedule, Valerie Mason, chair of Manhattan Community Board 8, told Crain\u2019s that \u201cwe remain extremely disappointed with the overall height and mass of the building,\u201d adding that the board will continue efforts to further shrink the project.\n\u201cLet there be no confusion, this process is difficult,\u201d said Upper East Side Council member\nKeith Powers\n, pointing to the back-and-forth with the local community. But he added that it was imperative to invest in Lenox Hill. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen firsthand in Manhattan what it looks like when we lose our hospitals,\u201d Powers said, likely referring to Mount Sinai\u2019s closure of Beth Israel Hospital.\nThe vote marks one of the last steps Northwell must clear to secure city approval for the redevelopment of its flagship Manhattan hospital. The full City Council is expected to vote on the project next week, followed by a review from the mayor.\n\u2014\nQuinn Waller\n",

It surpasses the Witkoff Group\u2019s\n$1,370-per-square-foot sale\nof the waterfront lot at 4766 North Bay Road in June.\nA trust in the names of Jorge E. Mattos Barrero and Sofia Patricia Toja Mondragon sold their 6,116-square-foot, five-bedroom and five-and-a-half-bathroom house to 68 LGC Revocable Trust, records show. The true buyer is unknown.\nMattos and his brother,\nCarlos\n, own Neos Group, a Colombian conglomerate that includes a construction company. They made their fortune through a car import and distribution company in Colombia.\nThe Mediterranean-style Miami Beach home, built in 1961 and expanded in 2001, sits on a 0.4-acre lot that faces north.\nA company led by the couple\npaid $8.8 million\nfor the property in 2015. Their investment paid off, as they sold it for nearly four times the price they paid a decade ago.\n\n\u201cThe buyer bought it sight unseen,\u201d Puig said, declining to identify the buyer or seller. \u201cThat tells you how attractive\nLa Gorce Island\nis.\u201d\nDanny Hertzberg of the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker represented the buyer. Hertzberg declined to comment.\nThe deed lists an address in Miami that is the same as the address for companies managed by Haygo Demirian. An attorney manages the trust that purchased the home.\nLa Gorce is among the island neighborhoods in Miami Beach that\u2019s seen a surge in price growth. In May,\u00a0 hedge fund manager Nick Maounis\npaid $75 million\nfor the waterfront estate at\n88 La Gorce Circle\n. That sale is a record for completed homes on the island, and one of the most expensive home sales in Miami-Dade County.\nIn March, developer James Curnin and his wife, Jennifer, sold their mansion at 66 La Gorce Circle\nfor $60 million\n. Nearly a year ago, consumer goods multimillionaire Anand Khubani\npaid $100 million\nfor the properties at 18, 22 and 24 La Gorce Circle, where he plans a massive estate.\n",

        "content": "A casino in San Jose has come under new ownership after a nearly $72 million deal \u2014 though it\u2019s still all in the family.\nThe site of the Bay 101 casino at 1788 North 1st Street in San Jose sold for $71.7 million,\nSiliconValley.com\nreported. The buyer was Timothy Bumb, CEO of Bay 101 cardroom operator Sutter\u2019s Place, while the seller was his brother, Brian Bumb, of S.J. Bayshore Development. Timothy Bumb is also an executive at S.J. Bayshore.\nThe $70 million-plus transaction was only for the property and doesn\u2019t affect the casino\u2019s operations, as ownership and management will remain in place, per SiliconValley.com.\nThe purchase price was 88.2 percent above the property\u2019s $38.3 million assessed value in January 2024, according to SiliconValley.com. To finance the purchase, Sutter\u2019s Place obtained a $65 million loan from Western Alliance Bank.\nDocumentary transfer taxes for the transaction include about $78,900 for Santa Clara County taxes, about $236,700 in city of San Jose taxes, and approximately $1.1 million for San Jose\u2019s Measure E real estate transfer tax, according to the deed.\n\nLast year, Sutter\u2019s Place, doing business as Bay 101, was involved in a legal spat with S.J. Bayshore Development, the landlord of the casino property, over Sutter Place\u2019s future ability to purchase the property, according to law firm\nCoblentz Patch Duffy &amp; Bass\n, which represented Bay 101.\nSutter\u2019s Place sued S.J. Bayshore for breaching the parties\u2019 lease agreement. In the suit, Bay 101 claims that S.J. Bayshore refused to choose an appraiser or conduct an appraisal of the property on which the cardroom is located, thereby delaying Bay 101\u2019s ability to exercise the option and buy the property.\nBay 101 was allegedly seeking $54 million in damages. Ultimately, a Santa Clara Superior Court jury awarded $14.2 million in damages to Bay 101 and declared that S.J. Bayshore wasn\u2019t entitled to any recovery on any of its claims of fraudulent concealment.\nIn addition to the Bay 101 casino, the Bumb family owns the flea market property at 1590 Berryessa Road near the Berryessa BART station. There are plans to potentially redevelop the site into a mixed-use property primarily consisting of housing, though construction has yet to begin.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Texas municipalities are working to fend off a state law that overrides local approvals by allowing residential redevelopment by right in nonresidential zones.\nThe city of Arlington is proposing roadblocks to the legislation, including increasing minimum parking requirements, creating minimum balcony requirements for apartments, mandating electric vehicle charging capabilities, and requiring a minimum of six stories for all developments fronting major thoroughfares.\nSenate Bill 840\ntakes effect Sept. 1, requiring cities to allow mixed-use residential and multifamily development in a zoning classification that allows office, retail or industrial development.\nCity planners presented the Arlington City Council with amendments to the city\u2019s code this week.\n\u201cIt is very obvious that all these additional requirements \u2014 which, by the way, are not required for other projects not under SB 840 \u2014 are very flagrantly targeting missing-middle housing,\u201d said Nicole Nosek, a\nYIMBY organizer\nwho lobbied for the law.\nFor example, under the current code, all multifamily projects need two of six possible amenities. However, for resi conversions with more than 80 units, a swimming pool and shaded children\u2019s play area would be mandatory, with no other options, under the proposed amendments.\n\nArlington isn\u2019t alone. Cities around Texas are trying to stump developers hoping to carry out resi redevelopment under SB 840, according to Dallas-based land attorney Misty Ventura.\nCities are \u201clooking for ways to avoid compliance with state law. And the regulation I see Arlington and other cities focusing most of their effort on is minimums rather than maximums,\u201d Ventura said. \u201cFrisco and others will follow the same playbook.\u201d\nIrving and Plano are weighing similar measures, Nosek and Ventura said.\nThe six-story minimum rule would require steel frames, presenting a considerable cost to resi conversions of stick-frame structures, Ventura said.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not being coy about it. They say, \u2018We\u2019re doing this in response to changes in state law, and we need to get it in place before Sept. 1.\u2019 They\u2019re blatantly trying to navigate their way around state law,\u201d she said.Texas lawmakers passed several measures alongside SB 840 to address a projected\nhousing shortage\n, measured at more than 300,000 homes, according to housing advocacy group Up for Growth.\n",

The firm paid $33.2 million for Daycroft and $24 million for Hamilton Gardens, both of which were appraised last year below the sale prices.\nThe deal for the combined properties breaks down to $304,000 per unit.\nThe seller behind the shell company is Ahron Rudich, principal of Empire Realty USA, according to the\nHartford Business Journal\n. Rudich faced pressure from residents to improve conditions at another Connecticut community he allegedly neglected, according to\nCT Insider\nreporting from last year.\nDaycroft, at 44-150 Blachley Road, spans eight buildings with 108 units across 104,000 square feet. Hamilton Gardens, at 333 Hamilton Avenue, includes four buildings with 80 units and 77,000 square feet. The properties were appraised at $23.7 million and $18.4 million, respectively, last year.\n\nK5 is led by Steve Kessner and his son Michael. The elder Kessner, a Bronx native, bought his first building in Manhattan in 1980 and amassed a 48-building portfolio he sold for $225 million in 2007. The firm has acquired nearly $400 million worth of commercial real estate assets in the New York metro, with a focus on value-add and repositioning strategies. The Stamford acquisitions fit that model, though K5 has not yet disclosed any plans for upgrades or redevelopment.\nThe deal adds 188 units to the firm\u2019s holdings and marks a continued push into suburban multifamily properties within its geographic footprint.\nRents have been soaring in Stamford and vacancy rates have remained below the national average.

In a news release at the time, Doronin said OKO and Tao \u201cwill craft an elevated experience that resonates with the district\u2019s dynamic spirit and sets a new standard for the city and beyond.\u201d\nAt some point after the announcement, the joint venture was dissolved, sources told\nTRD\n. OKO still plans to open a restaurant and lounge at 830 Brickell\u2019s top two floors, another source said.\nTao Group confirmed that the firm and OKO \u201cagreed to mutually part ways.\u201d OKO declined to comment.\nMiami-based OKO and London-based Cain International completed the 55-story\n830 Brickell\nlast fall at 830 Brickell Plaza in Miami, after a roughly two-year\ncompletion delay\n. It\u2019s the first new standalone office tower in the\nBrickell Financial District\nin over a decade.\n\nThe fully leased tower was under construction during the pandemic-induced influx of out-of-state companies to South Florida, leading to a preleasing bonanza at 830 Brickell. Tenants include wealth manager\nCorient\n, private equity firm\nThoma Bravo\n, law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis, Brazilian bank\nBanco Master\n, and Ken Griffin\u2019s\nCitadel and Citadel Securities\n.\nOver the past two years, new-to-market companies slowed their South Florida expansions, with some pulling the plug on planned offices. Financial services firm\nRothschild &amp; Co\n, which had leased 5,000 square feet at 830 Brickell in 2023, opted out of opening a Miami office. Law firm\nWinston &amp; Strawn,\nwhich also had preleased at 830 Brickell, opened an office at Southeast Financial Center in downtown Miami instead, citing the 830 Brickell construction delays.\nElsewhere in Miami, OKO and Cain are developing the 47-story, 135-unit Una Residences condo tower at 175 Southeast 25th Road in Brickell, and completed the 57-story, 249-unit Missoni Baia condo tower in Edgewater.\nTao Group, led by Noah Tepperberg and Jason Strauss, has a portfolio of restaurants, nightlife and daylife venues around the world. In South Florida, Tao has the Hakkasan Miami restaurant at Fontainebleau Miami Beach and, in partnership with Groot Hospitality, opened Casadonna restaurant in Miami\u2019s Edgewater. Tao is a subsidiary of Nicosia, Cyprus-based Mohari Hospitality.\nLast summer, OKO and Cain scored a\n$565 million\npermanent loan from Tyko Capital for 830 Brickell.\n",

        "content": "Lennar and its partners dusted off a three-year-old proposal for a megaproject on a 960-acre land tract outside of Miami-Dade County\u2019s Urban Development Boundary.\nMiami-based homebuilding giant Lennar and South Florida\u2019s Easton real estate family want to develop City Park with 7,800 for-sale and for-rent homes; 1.4 million square feet of commercial space; and 249 acres of open space, according to a pre-application they submitted to the county late last month. The site is between Southwest 136th and Southwest 152nd streets, and between Southwest 162nd and Krome avenues, near the Country Walk neighborhood in unincorporated Miami-Dade.\nDallas, Texas-based homebuilder Bill Albers also is partnering on the project, according to Ed Easton, the Easton family\u2019s patriarch and founder of Miami-based\nEaston Group\n.\nThe site consists of 11 lots primarily owned by Lennar, the Eastons, the Dallas investor and the Cheng family, according to records and Easton. Freight rail company CSX Transportation owns two lots. John C. Cheng Escartin is managing partner and international consultant for Panamanian tax, assurance and professional services firm HLB International, according to records. It has not been decided whether the Chengs will partner on the project or sell their properties to the developers, Easton said.\nA\nUDB\nexpansion is one of the most controversial proposals a developer can file in Miami-Dade, often drawing opposition from environmentalists and others seeking to stop suburban sprawl. Opponents often decry UDB expansions as development encroachment onto wetlands, open land that could be needed for preservation of Everglades National Park and Biscayne National Park, and farmland needed to meet the demand for produce.\nUDB\nexpansions require a super-majority vote by county commissioners, and often also face a mayor\u2019s veto and lawsuits.\nLennar and the Eastons first proposed City Park in 2022 and backed out of pursuing the project at the time.\n\n\u201cWe decided in the middle of it that it was not a good time to do it,\u201d Easton said, \u201cbecause we thought the housing market wasn\u2019t as much in need of something like this as it is today.\u201d\nSince then, South Florida\u2019s housing demand has grown, necessitating projects such as the City Park UDB expansion, Easton said, adding that Miami-Dade also struggles with a lack of developable land. Also, he said the City Park land has no environmental significance.\n\u201cSensible development on non-environmentally sensitive land like this one makes sense,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a need for more land for sensible development in Miami. This particular parcel does not have any environmental sensitivities.\u201d\nThe 2022 City Park concept book attached to the recent application depicts a somewhat self-supporting mixed-use development with its own schools, offices, retail and entertainment venues such as a lagoon or water park. The project would include the Village Core district with restaurants and entertainment, as well as a 10-acre farm.\nThe residences will include single-family homes, townhomes and apartments, according to the application. The project will include below-market rate homes, Easton said.\nThe developers are in the very first inning of the approval process, which could take until late next year or early 2027 to reach a final vote by commissioners, he said.\nThe last major proposal for UDB expansion was Coral Rock and Aligned Real Estate\u2019s South Dade Logistics &amp; Technology District on 379 acres. The developers won commission approval after five public hearings and survived Mayor Daniella Levine Cava\u2019s veto in 2022, but lost in court when a judge determined last year the county had\nmissed an approval deadline\n.\nLast month, a group of landowners, through their Herkoz and Alflo Sunset affiliates, proposed a\n64.8-acre UDB expansion\nfor a project with 1,200 single-family homes and apartments, and up to 90,000 square feet of retail. The site is on the northwest corner of Southwest 137th Avenue and Southwest 248th Street.\n",

The project is in the Logistics Campus, which is Dermody\u2019s redevelopment of the former Allstate headquarters at 3075 Sanders Road.\nDermody bought the 232-acre site for $232 million\nin 2022\n, with plans to build one of the largest urban logistics developments in the U.S. The 10-building, 3.2 million-square-foot complex will amount to a $500 million project, but finding tenants is taking some time.\nThe Pepsi facility is being built at the far southern end of the campus in the second phase of the development. The five-building first phase is mostly\nvacant\n. Four of those five buildings comprise 700,000 square feet up for lease.\nDental equipment manufacturer HuFriedyGroup leased one of the buildings, spanning 326,300 square feet, in March, though a target date for moving in has not been determined.\n\nThat lease followed an earlier agreement with California-based Upside Foods, which planned to build but then\npostponed\na 187,000-square-foot cultivated-meat facility at the campus, choosing to focus on its California operations instead.\nThe vacancy rate in greater Chicago\u2019s industrial market crept up 6.3 percent year-over-year in the second quarter, and construction was down 24 percent, according to Avison Young. The Pepsi warehouse is the only industrial project in development in Cook County, and its lease begins in February.\nOffice-to-industrial redevelopment, especially for data centers, is becoming a trend in the Chicago suburbs. Karis Critical, for example, is planning a\ntwo-building data-center complex\non the site of the former Alcatel\u2011Lucent office site in Naperville.\nAnd Compass Datacenters is redeveloping the 2.4 million-square-foot former Sears headquarters in Hoffman Estates into a data-center complex.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The ocean-to-lake property includes a tennis court, boat dock and an oceanfront pool and spa. It has seven bedrooms, eight bathrooms and three half-bathrooms.\n\nThe sellers listed the property in February 2024 for just under $40 million, and it was most recently\nasking $33 million\n.

Two successive plant-based grocery stores preceded XMarket, going back to 2021.\nTrader Joe\u2019s has not confirmed any plans for an Uptown store, telling Block Club the chain is always on the lookout for\npotential locations\nand has been eyeing Chicago, specifically, for new opportunities.\n\nThe chain has six stores in Chicago, ranging from Roscoe Village to Hyde Park, and a dozen or so more in the suburbs.\nThe application for a liquor license suggests more than a passing interest in the Uptown location, and a Trader Joe\u2019s could provide a boost to the area\u2019s retail scene beyond the 6,500-square-foot space, providing an amenity for residents and stirring commerce on Montrose Avenue.\nIndeed, residents of various neighborhoods on the\nFar North Side\nhave publicly pined for a Trader Joe\u2019s, which appeared set for a store in nearby Andersonville before the deal fell through two years ago.\nResidents and business interests in West Ridge tried to sell Trader Joe\u2019s on a location on Western Avenue, a pitch that came in the early days of the pandemic. Trader Joe\u2019s passed on the location, which eventually landed Starbucks as an anchor for a new development.Trader Joe\u2019s is known for its eponymous private-label foods, as well as quirky marketing and relatively\nlow prices\n, given its foodie sensibilities. It operates coast-to-coast, with locations in 42 states.\n",

City staff approved the change because the east side is not the primary facade of the building.\n\nThe measure approving the concept passed the Historic Design and Review Commission without objection, but the panel did set some conditions for Innjoy to address going forward. The developer was encouraged to salvage any brick that is removed during renovations and keep it on-site as a resource for future repairs.\nInnjoy partner Adrian Ramirez previously told the outlet that the residential conversion proved to be the developer\u2019s most compelling option on a conversion.\nInnjoy bought the building in 2020 and considered remaking it into a hotel before settling on a residential plan.\nInnjoy is no stranger to the hotel business. It bought the State National Bank Building in downtown Houston in 2020 and converted it to a Moxy hotel, part of the Marriott stable of brands. That deal set off speculation that the developer would turn the Nix Building into a hotel, but plans submitted to the San Antonio Historic Design and Review Commission indicate it has stuck with the plan for apartments.\nNo timeline has been set for construction.\n",

        "content": "New York City\u2019s broker fee ban is\nwreaking havoc\non rental data.\nThe number of new rental listings uploaded to local listing services has dropped dramatically since the law, known as the FARE Act,\ntook effect\nin mid-June. The provision prohibits landlords from charging tenants fees for agents they hired and imposes fines up to $2,000 per violation.\nBetween June 11 and July 31, brokers added just 1,400 rental listings to the Residential Listing Service, Brooklyn MLS and similar agent-facing platforms, compared to 5,300 listings submitted during the same period last year, according to data from UrbanDigs. The total marked a 74 percent decline in new listings year-over-year.\n\u201cThis sharp decline suggests landlords are using other listing sources as they adjust to the new FARE Act requirements,\u201d UrbanDigs\u2019 co-founder John Walkup wrote in a statement.\nThe \u201ccollapse\u201d in rental listings on the RLS comes after a July report from StreetEasy found rental inventory on its platform had held steady in the month after the law\u2019s passage, excluding a temporary drop in listings immediately after the law took effect.\nThe day after the FARE Act\u2019s implementation, more than 1,000 listings\ndisappeared from StreetEasy\n. The company chalked the sudden dip up to those represented by rental agents who did not have an updated compensation agreement in place before the law\u2019s implementation.\n\u201cThe outflow of listings has since stabilized and followed usual seasonal trends associated with summertime leasing activity,\u201d the report states.\n\nHowever, the platform logged an 8 percent decline in rental inventory across the five boroughs last month compared to July 2024, according to its data dashboard. Manhattan notched the largest drop, with inventory falling more than 11 percent.\n\u201cThe FARE Act curbs brokers\u2019 ability to market nonexclusive listings, leading to a noticeable drop in inventory across platforms,\u201d REBNY\u2019s senior vice president of residential brokerage wrote in a statement. \u201cWith vacancy rates at historic lows, this reduced visibility makes an already competitive market even harder to navigate for everyday New Yorkers.\u201d\nThe Real Estate Board of New York requires its members to submit rental listings to the RLS if they have an exclusive agreement with the landlord.\nUnlike consumer-facing platforms such as StreetEasy and Zillow, the RLS limits who can upload their listings directly to the service, as it is designed to encourage co-broking between agents. The platform does not allow landlords or property managers who are not licensed brokers to submit their units.\nREBNY and others in the industry cautioned that the law could drive rental inventory down, as the provision assumes that brokers have exclusive agreements with landlords, making the landlords responsible for their compensation. Before the law, brokers were able to market listings to tenants without an exclusive agreement with the landlord and collect fees from tenants directly.\nA federal judge has\nrejected multiple bids\nfrom REBNY to halt the FARE Act\u2019s implementation while a lawsuit it filed against the City Council makes its way through the courts. REBNY has alleged that the provision violates the First Amendment.\nSome agents have said the law\u2019s implementation has created chaos. Market analytics firms reported inflated rents in the immediate aftermath of the law, and uncertainty over how to properly comply with the rules.\n\u201cBoy, is it confusing,\u201d said Donna Olshan of Olshan Realty. She added that finding accurate data on the rental market was already a tall order, but the fallout from the new law could likely make it worse. \u201cI don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to keep the data now.\u201d\n",

        "content": "BH3 Management and Capstone Equities closed on 141 Willoughby Street and have major plans to reposition the vacant office tower in Downtown Brooklyn.\nThe joint venture acquired the 24-story, 400,000-square-foot building from Savanna through a foreclosure and is now seeking to convert part of the tower into 200 residential units.\nThe developers plan to add both market-rate and affordable housing with residences spanning studios all the way up to three bedrooms. Only floors two through seven of the 24-story building will consist of office space.\nThe conversion is expected to start in 2026.\nSavanna bought the site for\n$28 million\nin 2014. About seven years later, the developer finally nabbed $264 million in construction financing, a major coup at the time given the lack of office demand during Covid. PIMCO provided the senior debt, and CarVal Investors added the mezzanine loan, according to the\nCommercial Observer\n.\n\nSavanna bet corporate tenants would trickle into Downtown Brooklyn. But since the tower\u2019s completion in 2023, it has remained vacant.\nSavanna defaulted on its senior loan and Joshua Zamir\u2019s Capstone swooped in to purchase the debt from PIMCO and BH3 Management pitched in equity,\nThe Promote\nreported. Capstone initiated a non-judicial\nforeclosure\n. An auction date was set for June. The lender appears to have made a credit bid using its existing debt to acquire the property.\nThe Willoughby Street office building wasn\u2019t Savanna\u2019s only recent loss. Last year, it offloaded\n360 Lexington Avenue\nfor $65 million; it purchased the 270,000-square-foot office and retail property in 2019 for $180 million. Savanna also faced foreclosure last year at\n521 Fifth Avenue,\na 39-story, 460,000-square-foot office tower.\nNow, the firm is down another office building, and the property won\u2019t be solely office space for long.\n\u201c141 Willoughby Street presents a truly unique blank slate upon which to reimagine a newly developed institutional-grade asset,\u201d said Adam Falk of BH3 Management.\n",

The three-story property at\n230 West 11th Street\ntraded between two LLCs that hide the identities of the true parties in the transaction. The 25-foot-wide Italianate townhouse dates to 1860 and has three wood-burning fireplaces and a terrace. It has been fully gutted,\naccording to a Douglas Elliman listing\n.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe priciest commercial transaction recorded in the Big Apple was for $86 million in Downtown Brooklyn. A\nSavanna\naffiliate transferred all of its interest in an office building at\n141 Willoughby Street,\nalong with a neighboring parcel at\n383 Gold Street,\nto\nCapstone Equities\n, which had initiated a\nforeclosure action against the property\nin June\n.\nThe Class A office building stands 24 stories tall; Savanna completed construction on the property in 2022.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Carlos Saavedra\nand\nNicole Eckstrom\u2019s Eckstrom\nparted with a newly renovated, move-in-ready brownstone at\n51 Tompkins Place\nin Cobble Hill for $11.5 million \u2014 more than 134 percent more than its last trade price just two years ago. The buyer was an LLC. Brooklyn-based Eckstrom paid $4.9 million for the single-family home in 2023. The three-story property was built in 1899 and went on the market in April for $11.9 million. Saavedra and\nJorge Murillo\nwith Park Property Advisors listed the townhouse, and Douglas Elliman\u2019s\nLindsay Barton Barrett\nbrought the buyer.\n\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nAlso in Cobble Hill, a townhouse at\n219 Kane Street\nwith an attached garage was snapped up for $9.3 million. The sellers were\nChristopher and Kimberly Browne\n, and the buyers were\nHelga Locascio\nand\nMarco Locascio,\nvia a trust, and his wife\nEmily O\u2019Brien.\nThe home had been on and off the market for about a year, when it was first listed for sale in June 2024 for $11 million, according to\nRealtor.com.\nThe Brownes had owned the property since 2019, when they purchased it for $6.5 million. The Locascios recently sold a\nbrownstone in Park Slope for $6.5 million\n.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nIn Sunnyside, a two-story, more than 35,000-square-foot warehouse traded hands for $12 million. The seller of the property at\n41-39 39th Street\nwas a company linked to\nJoshua L. Goldman\nthat had owned the property for decades. The buyers were White Plains, New York-based\nOakland Trading Corp.\nand\n4141 Group LLC.\nThe deal works out to roughly $340 per square foot.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nA company tied to\nGregory Spatz\npicked up a four-story mixed-use property at\n385 Greenwich Street\nin Tribeca from an affiliate of\nRandal Gindi\nand\nZachary Gindi\nfor $8.5 million via a bankruptcy auction that was held in March. The property had been tied to the Gindi family since at least the 1970s, but the LLC that sold the building filed for bankruptcy protection in March, citing a $18.5 million unpaid mortgage on the Greenwich property and another on Nassau Street.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "Capitalism doesn\u2019t work without competition.\nSo it would be nice to see rank-and-file real estate people \u2014 who rightfully\noppose socialism\nfor things markets can do better \u2014 get just as worked up about anti-competitive practices in the industry.\nCredit bureaus are a good example. Three are dominant players: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. Instead of promoting competition among them, the government does the opposite.\nWhen a homebuyer applies for a mortgage that will be sold to or backstopped by Fannie and Freddie \u2014 and we\u2019re talking\n70 percent of mortgages\n\u2014 the two government-sponsored entities require that the buyer\u2019s credit history be obtained from all three major credit bureaus.\nBecause of this \u201ctri-merge\u201d policy, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion do not have to compete for that business. The result is higher prices that inflate closing costs for buyers.\nThe Mortgage Bankers Association has\nlong called for reforms\n, lamenting in a June blog that \u201cgovernment mandates for a tri-merge report have insulated providers from competitive pressures, allowing them to raise prices with little regard for quality, performance, or innovation.\u201d\nThe Biden administration heeded that call in 2022, proposing two alternatives to tri-merge. One was \u201c\nbi-merge\n\u201d \u2014 requiring a credit score from two of the three major credit bureaus. The other was using the FICO 10T and VantageScore 4.0 models. Again, two sources.\nThe proposal was never implemented because Joe Biden lost the election a year before its scheduled start date, which the Federal Housing Finance Agency postponed four days before Biden left office. Industry opposition was a factor. As\nsix large mortgage players\nlater told the Trump administration\u2019s FHFA director,\nBill Pulte\n, the plan created \u201csignificant uncertainty, complexity, and multitude of unanswered questions.\u201d\nLast month, Pulte allowed Fannie and Freddie to use VantageScore 4.0 by itself, which will help responsible renters become homeowners because VantageScore takes rent and utility payments into account.\nPulte\nalso ditched the bi-merge plan, leaving tri-merge as the other choice.\nThe Mortgage Bankers Association cheered that news, but wants to replace tri-merge with a\nsingle-score option\n: Equifax, Experian\nor\nTransUnion. Using all three was once necessary because their reports varied widely, but their information is far more consistent now, the MBA says. Single-score is working well for auto loans and home equity loans, according to the group.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWoody Pascal, who authored the\ncriteria\nby which a substantially rehabilitated building may be removed from rent stabilization, was\nhired four months ago\nby the New York Apartment Association, which represents rent-stabilized owners.\nThe criteria \u2014 as interpreted by the Division of Homes and Community Renewal \u2014 have turned out to be very difficult to meet, trapping\nsome buildings\nin rent stabilization.\n\nBut the NYAA clearly did not blame Pascal. It considers the regulations to be a product of the agency, not of Pascal in particular.\nSend your thoughts on sub rehab and demolition to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The G train, which fully opened in 1937, was the last complete subway line built in New York City. It was originally called the IND Crosstown Line. No subway stations have been built in Brooklyn since 1948, when the A train was extended from Broadway Junction to Euclid Avenue. The\nInterborough Express\n, if built as planned, would end both of those droughts.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 A former NYPD lawyer filed a corruption suit against the department and Mayor Eric Adams, alleging she was fired after recommending disciplinary action against the highest-ranking uniformed officer, former Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey, according to\nGothamist\n. The plaintiff, Amy Litwin, investigated Maddrey following allegations by civilians that he intervened to halt the arrest of a retired officer who threatened teenagers.\n\u2014 Three years into Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s five-year housing plan, the state says it has \u201cbuilt or preserved\u201d 65,000 of the 100,000 promised affordable homes, according to\nCity &amp; State\n.\u00a0 However, according to the official housing plan dashboard, only 47,000 homes are done or in the works. The state attributes this discrepancy to a delay in data collection. New York City has the bulk of the units \u2014 19,000, including 8,000 in Brooklyn.\n\u2014 There\u2019s no official enforcement or oversight of ballot petitions, Gothamist\nreported\n. The outlet looked into fraudulent signatures found on Adams\u2019 petitions and concluded that no city official reviews the signatures. Enforcement is typically done by rival campaigns.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$5.5 million\nfor a 3,650-square-foot townhouse at 683 Leonard Street in Greenpoint. The Yuval Vidal Team at Compass had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$12 million\nfor a 35,349-square-foot warehouse at 31-39 39th Street in Sunnyside.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$15 million\nfor a 4,032-square-foot condominium unit at 36 Bleecker Street in Noho. Tony Sargent at Compass has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for an 870,124-square-foot, 22- and 28-story project with 630 total units at 61-06 Junction Boulevard in Rego Park. Lu Ning Architecture filed the permit on behalf of Jiashu Xu of Grand Construction and Development.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

Neither returned requests for comment.\n\nMcNamee, who wasn\u2019t immediately reachable, refinanced the property for $160 million, or $5,691 per square foot, in 2019.\nRodeo Drive \u2014 where rents average $1,000 per square foot per year plus triple net \u2014 has notched some hefty retail investment sales prices in recent years.\nThose include LVMH\u2019s\n$245 million purchase\nof a 22,270-square-foot two-story double lot at 468 North Rodeo Drive (or $11,001 per square foot); hotelier Efrem Harkham\u2019s\n$200 million sale\nof the 42,560-square-foot 360 North Rodeo Drive that housed his Luxe boutique hotel plus three high-end retail stores (or $4,699 per square foot); LVMH\u2019s\n$110 million acquisition\nof the 6,200-square-foot property at 456 North Rodeo Drive (or $17,742 per square foot); and Shabani\u2019s purchase of two storefronts spanning 11,600 square feet at 457-459 North Rodeo Drive for\n$112 million\n(or $10,500 per square foot).\nIn Beverly Hills, the 338 North Rodeo Drive deal is believed to mark the second-highest deal for a single property behind Nicholas and Christian Candy\u2019s 2007 $500 million purchase of the former Robinson\u2019s-May department store site.\n",

        "content": "In an otherwise dismal suburban office market, the O\u2019Hare area is gaining.\nThe submarket boasted the highest average asking rent in Chicago\u2019s suburbs last quarter, with rents up 5.5 percent year-over-year, according to Transwestern. The submarket\u2019s average rent climbed to $33.07 per-square-foot, outpacing the average suburban Chicago office rent of $27.12 per square foot.\nNo other suburban Chicago submarkets tracked by Transwestern saw rents increase by more than 1.5 percent year-over-year, and rents fell by more than 5 percent in two submarkets.\nEven with O\u2019Hare\u2019s slight advantage, the overall region is in worse shape than it was pre-pandemic.\nIn 2019, the suburban office market\u2019s direct vacancy rate hovered around 15 percent and now sits at 20 percent. The overall vacancy rate, which includes space being marketed, is at 26 percent.\n\nDemand had softened in the suburban markets before the pandemic, but the steep decline in office demand since then accelerated the trend.\nNow, class A offices, landlords with significant tenant-improvement dollars to offer or properties with close proximity to the airport appear to be attracting the few tenants that are looking for space.\nSignificant transactions in the second quarter included a 79,800-square-foot lease signed by the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund for the entire building at 800 Commerce Drive in Oak Brook. The lease did little to improve overall market conditions, however, as the firm is relocating from a 60,000 square-foot space at 2211 York Road, also in Oak Brook.\nJust down the road, Ashley Capital bought an 183,400-square-foot office building at 2001 York Road for $10 million, under $55 per square foot, from Varde Partners. Though the sale was rare for the slow market, it marked a significant decline in value for the property.\nThe building last sold in 2013 for $34 million, or $185 per square foot.",

        "content": "The lending arm of the Rok family is accusing Miami-based developer Marlon Gomez of delaying the court sale of an Aventura site by allegedly filing frivolous bankruptcy petitions.\nAn affiliate of Aventura-based Rok Lending, led by CEO Bryan Morjain, is seeking to immediately reschedule an Aug. 4 foreclosure auction. It was canceled due to Gomez\u2019s entity that owns the 1.6-acre property at\n21291 Northeast 28th Avenue\nfiling for bankruptcy protection, court records show.\nIn February, Rok Lending\u2019s affiliate won a final judgment of $19.9 million against Gomez\u2019s entity, which allegedly defaulted on a\n$15 million\nloan issued in 2023.\nIn an emailed statement, Gomez said his entity and Rok Lending have worked out a resolution. \u201cWe have reached agreement with Rok on a deal that works for both of us,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cWe have our refinancing in process, look forward to paying off our loan and restarting an excellent project.\u201d\nRepresentatives and attorneys for Rok Lending did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nGomez\u2019s entity filed two Chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions in the past four months in order to stall the court sale of the property, where Gomez is planning a 142,000-square-foot medical office building, according to filings by Rok Lending\u2019s affiliate in Miami-Dade Circuit Court and Miami federal bankruptcy court.\nThe Aventura development site was first scheduled to be sold at an auction on April 22. But Gomez\u2019s entity filed for Chapter 11 protection the day before, which stayed the foreclosure proceedings, court records show. On May 20, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Mark dismissed the petition and restricted Gomez\u2019s entity from refiling for Chapter 11 protection for a period of 180 days, according to filings in bankruptcy court.\nHowever, Gomez\u2019s entity filed a second Chapter 11 petition \u201cjust minutes before the rescheduled [Aug. 4] foreclosure sale,\u201d a Rok Lending motion states. The petition lists assets between $10 million and $50 million and liabilities in the same amounts. Rok Lending alleges that the second bankruptcy petition is void due to the 180-day prohibition.\n\u201cTo be clear, the damage to [Rok Lending\u2019s] interests require emergent relief,\u201d the motion states. \u201cThis property is underwater and every day that [Rok Lending\u2019s] realization on its collateral is delayed results in immediate and irreparable damage.\u201d\nThe Aventura site is not the only property tied to Gomez that is facing foreclosure. A court-appointed receiver is listing a distressed 1.8-acre Miami River development site for\n$18.1 million\nthat is owned by a Gomez-managed entity. Karson &amp; Co and The Porosoff Group, the brokerages marketing the Miami River property, have set an Aug. 20 deadline to receive offers.The site is subject to a pending foreclosure lawsuit filed in March by a lender alleging Gomez\u2019s entity defaulted on a\n$10 million loan\n.",

        "content": "Gary Mkrtichyan said his construction company Opus Builders receives two to three calls per day from prospective wildfire rebuilding clients.\nHe\u2019s got about a dozen\nAltadena homeowners\nhe\u2019s working with but thinks that could easily grow to 20 within the next couple of months. That\u2019s in addition to a mixed-use project with apartments above ground-floor commercial near Palisades Village in Pacific Palisades.\nAs more homeowners make the decision to stay and\nrebuild\n, nailing down a consensus on cost is a bit like herding cats. In other words, a painful exercise with seemingly no point.\nThe construction inflation is real, according to Mkrtichyan who said some of the quotes he hears are coming in wildly beyond reality for his company.\nAn example? The conversation around pricing that\u2019s $700 and above per square foot to rebuild. Mkrtichyan can\u2019t see it.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not one client that I\u2019m charging $700 a square foot,\u201d he said. \u201cI built three homes in the Palisades prior to the fires below that number. Now, OK, I understand there\u2019s been some appreciation. There\u2019s a labor shortage, especially with ICE [raids], but I know this is not the reason for these numbers people are talking about.\u201d\nThe exception would be maybe adding a basement level, he said.\nMkrtichyan said there\u2019s no client for which Opus Builders is currently charging more than $550 to $600 per square foot at the moment. The company bills itself as a one-stop-shop general contractor specializing in upscale custom homes and commercial projects, which could explain what some might call a low quote.\nOpus has the capacity to handle architecture, design and construction internally, while working with a roster of subcontractors and acting as a project manager on planning, permitting and sourcing of finishes. All of that being overseen by a single touchpoint can in some ways help keep costs in line.\nThe builder walks into what\u2019s become a heated discussion among some. It\u2019s one some might say began in February when The Agency\u2019s Ben Belack posted an\nInstagram video\non rebuilding.\nBelack broke down the challenges developers face in buying burned Palisades lots based on a construction cost of $600 per square foot. When factoring in the cost of the Measure United to House L.A. tax, in addition to commission, escrow, title and other fees, the end result is a loss.\nMeasure ULA, which was a 2022 ballot measure marketed as the Mansion Tax, applies a 4 percent levy on deals starting at $5.3 million. It creeps up to 5.5 percent on deals of $10.6 million or more. It\u2019s relevant in the Palisades rebuilding conversation because the community is part of the city of Los Angeles. Eaton Fire properties, if resold, are not subject to the tax because Altadena and Pasadena are not part of the city of Los Angeles.\n\u201cThe lesson here is that prohibitive measures like the Mansion Tax continue to discourage builders from building in Los Angeles and, before you vilify the homebuilders, we really need them right now to replace all the homes and communities the fire just took from us,\u201d Belack says in his video. \u201cThe land is for sale because these specific families are unable to rebuild, so unless we allow builders to make a few bucks, which is usually around 20 percent of their investment, Los Angeles remains in a housing crisis.\u201d\n\nMounting headaches\nBelack\u2019s post, as of Thursday, had garnered nearly 29,000 likes and almost 3,000 comments from people launching discussions on land values, zoning, affordable housing in the state, taxes and the subject of costs to rebuild. Central to Belack\u2019s post wasn\u2019t to set off a squeal over who was charging what, but to point out\nMeasure ULA\n\u2019s impediment to rebuilding.\nEven still, it cracked open a discussion around cost that has been eating away at residents since the Jan. 7 fires.\nResults of a\nsurvey\ndone between March 6 and April 11 show\nPalisades\nresidents estimating $800 per square foot for construction, which was culled from 307 respondents. That\u2019s an average based on a range swinging from $400 to over $1,200 a foot.\nThe Urban Land Institute sponsored the survey that was administered by Real Estate Consulting, with endorsements from the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and USC Lusk Center for Real Estate.\nThe Eaton fire data in that same survey draws from a smaller pool of 37 respondents that estimated an average of $580 per square foot in construction costs. The mean was based on a range of $400 to $800 per square foot.\nFor most wildfire victims, budgets are not unlimited. In fact, those on the ground almost universally call out the funding shortfall for rebuilds as a major pain point.\nOpus\u2019 Mkrtichyan is no different, pointing out most in Altadena that he\u2019s working with don\u2019t have sufficient funds to cover rebuilding. Some, he said, applied for relief through the U.S. Small Business Administration in a bid to offset some of the difference. THE SBA offers disaster loans up to $500,000 for the repair or replacement of a primary residence and up to $100,000 for personal property loss. Other clients of Opus Builders paid out of pocket to make up the difference, but those are typically residents that were already doing a remodel and had funds available.\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s probably 60-40 between people who have just enough to rebuild and then 40 [percent] are probably ones that don\u2019t have enough or had a lapse in coverage and those people are the ones that are either going towards the SBA or they\u2019re stuck, and they have to sell or figure out some sort of funding,\u201d Mkrtichyan said.\nOnce homeowners push past questions of funding, it\u2019s now navigating\npermitting\n.\nSo far, Opus Builders has six Altadena projects submitted to the county. They\u2019re part of the 1,454 applications received as of Thursday for the unincorporated areas impacted by the Eaton fire, according to Los Angeles County. That\u2019s a jump of over 100 applications since Monday. So far, 172 building permits have been issued.\n\u201cI think they\u2019re overwhelmed,\u201d Mkrtichyan said of the system. \u201cIt\u2019s too much workload and there is a void between submitting and getting a response.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Nathan Berman\u2019s Metro Loft sealed the deal on its recapitalization of one of its most prominent conversions.\nMetro Loft secured a five-year, $280 million mortgage to refinance its debt at 180 Water Street in the Financial District, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The Deutsche Bank loan carries a 6.4 percent fixed interest rate, according to Moody\u2019s.\nTo avoid a looming $365 million debt maturity, Metro Loft also brought in additional investors. Sentuy Realty and 60 Guilders bought the property\u2019s mezzanine loan for $80 million and invested an additional $40 million in the building.\nMetro Loft is still an owner of the property, though Berman didn\u2019t disclose what his stake in the building was at this point. In May, it was reported that 60 Guilders and Sentry would\nacquire a combined 50 percent interest\nin the property.\nIn April, the special servicer of a $265 million securitized loan filed a pre-foreclosure action against Metro Loft, which came after a November KBRA report revealing Metro Loft was nearing default on its mortgage.\n\nAfter the pre-foreclosure action was filed, a representative of the developer said it would be \u201cbringing in a new partner to pay off the debt.\u201d The pre-foreclosure case was expected to be dropped when the recap was finalized, though it\u2019s unclear if that\u2019s happened yet; Metro Loft did not immediately respond to a request for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nBerman\npaid $450 million\nin 2017 to buy Vanbarton Group out of the rental property. That was three years after Metro Loft purchased a minority stake in the property and two years after the partners launched a $100 million conversion.\nThe 573-unit, 460,000-square-foot conversion opened in 2017. Occupancy is at 98 percent. Amenities include a 1,200-square-foot courtyard and an indoor pool.\nApartments are leasing for an average of $5,000, according to Moody\u2019s, and the building generated $17 million in net operating income last year. The property was valued at $378 million in an appraisal two months ago.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The debt should enable Namdar to start work on the two developments, which will carry a combined 1,126 units between them.\nThe Van Reipen Avenue project will stand 27 stories tall, according to\nNew York YIMBY\n, and include 696 units with 19,000 square feet of retail space and another 3,100 square feet of commercial space.\nAt 612 Pavonia, meanwhile, 432 units will be spread across another 27-story building, as well as 4,500 square feet of retail space and 3,300 square feet for a \u201cprofessional office spa.\u201d\n\nA Newmark team of Jordan Roeschlaub, Nick Scribani and Max Ralby arranged the financing. None of the firms involved in the transaction responded to the outlet\u2019s requests for comment.\nNamdar is one of Jersey City\u2019s most active developers. Just four months ago, Hudson Bay Capital Management provided the company with $335 million to refinance a trio of multifamily buildings, all in the same Journal Square neighborhood.\nKushner Companies is also investing heavily in the neighborhood. Last month, Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies\nprovided a $515 million loan\nfor Kushner\u2019s One Journal Square, which also opened recently to residents. The development spans 2 million square feet across two 52-story towers, containing 1,723 units; the refinancing only covers the first phase of the development.\nIn the spring, Tyko provided a\n$392 million construction loan\nfor David Martin and Jackie Soffer\u2019s long-planned convention center hotel in Miami Beach. The developers are planning to build a 17-story, 800-room hotel next to the Miami Beach Convention Center.\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Starlife Group launched an EB-5 investor program that will help fund construction of a planned luxury Hollywood rental development.\nAventura-based Starlife, led by CEO Gevorg Shahbazyan, is seeking EB-5 investors for 21 Hollywood, a 14-story, 200-unit building that will include about 10,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space at 2100 North Federal Highway. A Starlife affiliate paid $6.5 million for the 1.5-acre development site in 2023.\nShahbazyan said his fund is seeking 25 investors who can invest a minimum of $800,000 each, for a total of $20 million. The federal visa program provides permanent U.S. residency to foreigners and their immediate family members who invest in businesses, including real estate developments, that create at least 10 full-time American jobs.\n\u201cAssume that the construction loan today is averaging about 8 to 10.5 percent interest,\u201d Shahbazyan said. \u201cEB-5 offers much lower interest rates, of 5 to 7 percent, or sometimes lower. It\u2019s a great tool for the investors to become U.S. residents. The only downside is it\u2019s a bit slow.\u201d\nHe expects investors from Asia and Latin America, where EB-5 is most popular. (The Trump administration is working on a\ngold card program\nthat will provide citizenship to foreigners who pay about $5 million.)\nStarlife\u2019s construction affiliate is building the Hollywood project, and work began earlier this year, records show. It\u2019s expected to be completed by early 2027. Kobi Karp designed the project.\n\nThe developer secured site plan approval in late 2023. Units will range from 489-square-foot studios to 1,250-square-foot, three-bedroom apartments. Shahbazyan said apartments made the most sense for the site after completing a market analysis.\n\u201cWe believe the rental market is the strongest, highest and best use for this area, especially luxury because there\u2019s not a lot,\u201d he said.\nStarlife has multifamily, mixed-use, hotel and single-family and townhouse developments, mostly in Broward County. Hollywood 21 marks its first in\nHollywood\nand its first EB-5-funded project, Shahbazyan said.\nEarlier this year, developer Louis Birdman and his partners\nadvanced plans\nto build 618 apartments in Hollywood, as part of a mixed-use development on a city-owned brownfield property just west of I-95.\nCalta Group, led by brothers Gaetano and Ignazio Caltagirone, are building a pair of apartment projects in Hollywood totaling 251 rentals. In February, they secured a\n$53.7 million construction loan\nfor Caltopia Hollywood at 2750 Van Buren Street and Caltopia Hollywood II at 2217-2239 Jackson Street.\n",

It has another five conversions under its belt in various markets around the U.S.\n\nThe latest deal indicates that Foundry Commercial sees continued potential as office markets are ailing in many suburban markets. The strategy is based on what the developer expects to be \u201cstrong demand from logistics and manufacturing users who want to be closer to labor, rooftops, and major transportation corridors,\u201d partner and general manager Jim Traynor told the outlet.\nSupporting the strategy in Irving is limits on industrial zoning amid strong demand for Class A industrial space, which the developer can address with new construction.\nThe developer has retained Holt Lunsford Commercial\u2019s Andrew Gilbert and Keaton Bryce \u2014 the duo behind the recent $43.5 million sale of the Dallas Morning News\u2019 620,000-square-foot printing facility in Plano \u2014 to handle leasing on the latest project in Irving.\n",

        "content": "Local firm Sightwell is pitching an $18 million development on the site of a former lumber yard in the downtown of suburban village East Dundee.\nThe proposed Heritage Station development would center around a performing arts center and feature a mix of retail, apartments and townhomes, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. The village purchased the property at 110 Railroad Street, previously the site of Doederlein Lumber, in 2023. The primary stipulation placed on the property by the village board of trustees was that any development include a performing arts center.\nSightwell was the sole developer to submit plans to the village\u2019s request for proposal. The firm pitched an 8,000-square-foot performing arts center consisting of a 4,000-square-foot stage and 2,000-square-foot lobby, flexible seating and classrooms. A second floor would include six apartments and 10 suites of lodging.\nAnother residential component would face Hill Street, adding nine to 12 townhomes with alley garages and front stoops.\nThe performing arts center was proposed as a lease-to-own structure in order to attract nonprofit or other civic organizations to take the helm. Andy Burns, co-founder of Sightwell, said the concept is designed to promote walkability, and decisions on businesses to go in the retail component will complement existing downtown commerce.\n\nOf the three design options proposed, one featuring a clock tower appealed most to the trustees.\nStillwell asked the village to sell the company the site for $10 and contribute $2.5 million in Tax Increment Financing. Another $10 million would come from private investors and $5.5 million from the organization that ends up leasing the performing arts center.\nQuestions remain about the development going forward. Located a little more than a block from the Fox River and located in a flood plain, trustees raised concerns about how that might potentially affect neighboring properties. Sightwell promised to assess those concerns in the engineering process.\nA decision to move forward will come in the coming months after a development agreement is drafted with the village for board approval, potentially lending to construction starting at the end of next year, with a target completion in summer 2028.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Florida Value Partners is now a major landlord in the Kendall office submarket after picking up a three-property portfolio near South Miami for $34.3 million.\nMiami Lakes-based Florida Value Partners, led by Gus Alfonso, Ed Farah and Alicio Pi\u00f1a, acquired Commons on Sunset at 9350-9360 Southwest 72nd Street, The Forum of Sunset at 9415-9425 Southwest 72nd Street and Sunset Square at 9485-9495 Sunset Drive, records and real estate database Vizzda show. The portfolio spans 260,000 square feet of office space.\nThe buyer financed the purchase with a $34 million loan from City National Bank of Florida. Two entities managed by Elizabeth Colross Harper in Miami sold the properties, which have a total of six buildings completed in 1985, 1987, 1989 and 1994, records show.\nThe portfolio, representing an estimated 10 percent of the overall inventory in the\nKendall\nsubmarket, is near\nBaptist Hospital\n, Alfonso said in a statement.\n\u201cFlorida Value Partners plans to reposition and renovate the vintage office portfolio,\u201d Alfonso said. \u201cThe renovation will provide more opportunities for medical tenancy while modernizing the existing office campus.\u201d\n\nHarper\u2019s entities sold the three properties for nearly 10 times above the previous sale prices. In the largest deal, Florida Value Partners paid $12.5 million for Sunset Square, a complex with two low-rise buildings on 4.4 acres, records show. The seller paid $1.4 million in 1984.\nThe firm paid $11.8 million for Commons on Sunset, a 4.5-acre site with a pair of two-story office buildings, records show. The seller paid $1.3 million in 1989.\nThe buyer paid $10 million for the third property, The Forum of Sunset, which also has a pair of two-story buildings on 4.4 acres, records show. Harper\u2019s entity paid $1 million in 1994.\nSince its founding in 2009, Florida Value Partners has acquired, managed and developed more than $1 billion in real estate properties, including 7,000-plus apartments, two million square feet of commercial space and 3,000 acres of land acquisitions, a press release states.\nIt is also partnering with Chicago-based\nJohn Buck\n, Aventura-based BH Group and Boca Raton-based Pebb Enterprises to develop a 41-story mixed-use tower in downtown Miami.",

        "content": "Chicago State University is floating an offer of ground leases on a chunk of its campus fronting 95th Street in hopes of drawing proposals for a mixed-used development in the Rosedale neighborhood on the South Side.\nThe school\u2019s plan to lure private developers for residential buildings that would house up to 528 tenants, along with 25,000 square feet of shops and restaurants, comes as near- and longer-term projects take shape around the 160-year-old public institution, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nA $56 million renovation of a nearby regional Metra transit station is in the works, and the Chicago Transit Authority\u2019s plan to extend its Red Line will serve the campus area. All of that is is taking shape just a few miles from the quantum computing campus the State of Illinois plans to sponsor at the former South Works steel mill along the Lake Michigan\nPlans call for the additions of housing and retail to what is now open green space on the Chicago State campus.\nA request for proposals calls for would-be developers to offer plans for financing, design and timelines.The school expects four phases of development, with the eventual possibility of additional apartments, ranging from studios to \u201cfamily-sized units\u201d to achieve a \u201ccollege town experience.\u201d\n\nChicago State has an annual enrollment of about 2,000 and is the lone four-year institution serving a predominantly Black student body in Illinois. It is largely a commuter school, serving locals who do not live on campus, and generates about $1.6 billion in economic activity, according to a recent state study, which found that about 20 percent of the money is spent outside its immediate area.\nThe redevelopment plan aims to capture more of the economic activity within the South Side neighborhood.\n\u201cUniversity Village 95 is more than a real estate project. It\u2019s a commitment to equitable development through real estate investment,\u201d said Andrea Zopp, chair of the CSU board of trustees, who previously served as deputy mayor and chief neighborhood development officer under Rahm Emanuel\u2019s mayorship.\nThe materials the school distributed by the plan did not spell out much in the way of specifics on what would be considered \u201cequitable development\u201d or how the plan would conform to the broadly stated goal.\n",

        "content": "Developer Michael Shvo has engaged in a high-stakes arbitration dispute with Bayerische Versorgungskammer, the German pension fund that has backed many of his high-profile U.S. projects.\nShvo has filed a claim through the private Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, alleging he is owed more than $85 million in fees, including $27 million in payments tied to specific properties and $21 million in carried interest from the Transamerica Pyramid project in San Francisco,\nBisnow reported\n.\nBVK said in a statement it is \u201cnot unusual to seek a separation, possibly prematurely, depending on the performance of an investment, the overall market or the existing interest of third parties.\u201d\nShvo declined to comment, according to Bisnow.\nThe legal clash comes amid mounting concerns in Germany over BVK\u2019s exposure to Shvo\u2019s ventures, which have faced delays and financial troubles. Shvo\u2019s projects \u2014 often funded by German pensioner money \u2014 include the Raleigh Hotel in Miami, Mandarin Oriental Residences in Beverly Hills and 711 Fifth Avenue in New York. BVK has invested more than $712 million in Shvo-related deals via a fund managed by Deutsche Finance America, though the pension fund emphasizes it has no direct contractual relationship with Shvo.\nThe arbitration dispute was sparked in part by leadership upheaval. Rainer Komenda, BVK\u2019s longtime real estate head, and Jason Lucas, who oversaw BVK\u2019s U.S. investments at Deutsche Finance, have both exited their roles. The Bavarian State Parliament has questioned BVK after German tabloid Abendzeitung reported on potential pension fund losses tied to Shvo\u2019s struggling developments. BVK has since launched an internal review.\n\nBVK maintains that its investments are managed prudently and that any potential losses will not impact pension benefits. In 2024, BVK achieved a 3.4 percent net return, which it says exceeds its actuarial requirements.\nSome of Shvo\u2019s projects have stalled or defaulted.\nIn Miami, redevelopment of the historic Raleigh Hotel has dragged on for years, and the property is now subject to a $275 million bid from\nNahla Capital\n, which Shvo can match to retain control. In Beverly Hills, he\ndefaulted\non $200 million in loans just four months after completing the Mandarin Oriental Residences, selling most of the units in bulk to Centurion Real Estate Partners.\nShvo recently achieved a legal victory in a\nhigh-profile dispute\nwith members-only Core Club, a tenant in the Transamerica Pyramid. Earlier this week, a New York judge ordered Core Club to pay him nearly $1 million. The club took out a $750,000 loan from Shvo in 2022, but defaulted by failing to pay up when its location on Manhattan\u2019s Fifth Avenue opened the next year.\nCore is appealing the decision and continues to accuse Shvo of misconduct.\n\u2014Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "Two New Yorkers are facing prison after allegedly swiping a Kew Gardens Hills home from a dying widow \u2014 the first prosecution under the state\u2019s new deed-theft law.\nOn Thursday, New York Attorney General Letitia announced the indictment of Deepa Roy, 68, of Manhattan, and Victor Quimis, 39, of Queens, for falsifying property records to take the longtime home of Renuka Bherwani, who was in hospice care. Quimis was arrested earlier this week; Roy remains at large, according to\nCrain\u2019s\n.\nProsecutors say the pair forged Bherwani\u2019s signature in October to transfer the home to themselves for nothing, then repeated the trick in December to move it into a Quimis-controlled shell company. That helped the pair allegedly set up a $552,500 mortgage, which they allegedly used to clear the property\u2019s debts and pocket roughly $312,000.\nRoy allegedly earned at least $15,000 for her part in the scheme.\nBherwani\u2019s family discovered the theft only when city mail congratulating Quimis on his \u201cnew\u201d ownership arrived at the house. The widow, who bought the home with her husband in 1986, had been battling dementia since 2020 and granted power of attorney to her son and daughter-in-law. Prosecutors allege Roy insinuated herself into the home after her husband\u2019s death in 2022, posing as a friend and even asking to move in \u2014 a request the family denied.\n\nJames said deed theft has become rampant in gentrifying neighborhoods where homeowners are \u201ccash-poor and equity-rich,\u201d with scammers targeting seniors and those in financial distress. The attorney general\u2019s office is also probing a Harlem case where a brownstone worth millions was allegedly stolen, leaving its owner homeless.\nThe 2023 law \u2014 drafted by James and Brooklyn state Sen. Zellnor Myrie \u2014 extended the statute of limitations on cases and gave the AG authority to prosecute directly, rather than relying on local district attorneys. A companion measure passed also gave the attorney general and local prosecutors the power to\nhalt court proceedings\nwhere the possession of a property is in dispute.\nBoth Roy and Quimis face charges including grand larceny and residential mortgage fraud, carrying potential sentences of eight to 25 years.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The property consists of the Tavares Cove I complex and the Tavares Cove II complex.\nLawrence M. Abramson and Sarajane Abramson Marell, as trustees of the Ruth C.

Generally, residents own their mobile home and rent the lot it sits on.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that Havenpark will redevelop Tavares Cove because the firm is a manager of manufactured home communities.

A four-level podium and six subterranean parking levels will hold 581 cars. The design by Arcadis includes rooftop and podium-level amenity decks.\nThe project replaces a surface parking lot. Construction will take more than 30 months, although a start date is not set.\nAlong with project entitlements, the council approved a nearly $11.5 million public benefits package in exchange for a floor area rights transfer from the Los Angeles Convention Center. While officials initially proposed directing some of those funds to the convention center itself, revised conditions now allocate the funds toward affordable housing.\nThe high-rise is one part of Mack\u2019s broader redevelopment vision for the Downtown L.A. market. A second proposed tower \u2014 a 60-story building with more than 700 units \u2014 is planned just east across Olive Street.\n\nThose developments are the final phases of a large-scale plan Mack Real Estate launched a decade ago with AECOM. Completed elements include the 362-unit Wren apartments on Pico Boulevard, the 38-story Aven tower on Grand Avenue and a pocket park. Additionally, a 16-story hotel has already been approved for a nearby site at 12th Street and Olive.\nTogether, the projects mark a transformation of the South Park neighborhood in Downtown L.A., as high-density mixed-use towers replace surface parking lots and industrial buildings.\nNew York-based Mack was founded in 2013 after William Mack liquidated his family\u2019s holdings in Apollo Real Estate Advisers, according to the company website. It has three divisions focused on development and ownership, lending and property management. The company is run by CEO Richard Mack.\n\u2014Joel Russell\n",

Even though Hidalgo pitched her plan as a \u201cpenny\u201d increase, no specific numbers were put forth.\nDemocrat commissioners Lesley Briones, Rodney Ellis and Adrian Garcia withheld support for Hidalgo\u2019s proposal along with Republican Commissioner Tom Ramsey. As no one seconded Hidalgo\u2019s proposal for a vote, it died.\n\nEllis proposed his own plan, which would\u2019ve increased the county tax rate by 2.8 cents per $100 valuation, and Judge Hidalgo seconded the measure, but it failed in a 3-2 vote.\nThe failed motions came after a contentious morning where Hidalgo held signs with her staff and encouraged children in the audience, who were purportedly recipients of child care paid for from the ARPA funds, to take part in demonstrations for the property tax hike. The judge and fellow commissioners also accused one another of lying to the public.\nResident resentment to additional taxes is growing, the outlet said. After last year\u2019s disastrous spring and summer storms, the May derecho and Hurricane Beryl in July, Commissioners passed a disaster-rate tax hike \u2014 allowed by the state of Texas to bypass the typical 3.5 percent threshold that would require voter-approval. That raised the county\u2019s overall tax rate from $0.35007 to $0.38529 per $100 valuation.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Aurora Capital Associates snagged a signed contract for a penthouse at 140 Jane Street asking $87.5 million,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nThe pending deal comes just four months after the developer announced it was\npreparing to list\nthe property, one of 15 units at the West Village project.\nIf the condo closes for its listing price, the deal would set a new record for Downtown Manhattan, unseating a unit at the Witkoff Group\u2019s 150 Charles that traded for\n$60 million\nearlier this year. The sellers, financier Harsh Padia and his wife, interior designer Purvi Padia, sold the apartment for roughly double what they paid for it nine years earlier.\nPlans for the 9,500-square-foot penthouse at 140 Jane Street include floor-to-ceiling windows, a wraparound terrace and three balconies. The building, which quietly launched sales last summer, is slated for completion in early 2027. All but one of its units have already entered contract.\nThe inked contract \u201creinforces what everyone\u2019s saying about Downtown Manhattan,\u201d said Nikki Field of Sotheby\u2019s International, who\u2019s representing the buyer in the deal. \u201cIt\u2019s the new billionaires\u2019 coast.\u201d\n\nField declined to share the identity of the buyer but said her client agreed to purchase the property from a Zoom presentation. She added that the city\u2019s new development market hasn\u2019t seen a building so close to sellout this far in advance of completion since Extell Development\u2019s One57, signaling high demand for quality projects in the face of rapidly declining new development inventory.\nA Corcoran Sunshine team, led by Tara King-Brown, is heading sales at the project. Both King-Brown and Field declined to share the sale price.\nNews of the contract first surfaced in an Instagram post on Compass\u2019 Leonard Steinberg\u2019s account pushing back against industry outcry against private exclusive listings, including criticisms that marketing homes through this channel prevents sellers from nabbing top-tier prices.\n\u201cThe Downtown luxury markets are significantly healthier than the numbers being reported.\u00a0 Especially in brand new buildings,\u201d Steinberg wrote in the comment. \u201cThose spewing a narrative that private exclusives depress all pricing are obviously very wrong.\u201d\nJake Indursky contributed reporting.\n",

Cejas\u2019 420 Lincoln Rd Development LLC is requesting to rezone the 1.6-acre site at that address, to replace the 15,340-square-foot commercial building at 1600 Washington Avenue with a planned 15-story, 210-unit multifamily development, the outlet reported.\nThe apartments will span nearly 217,000 square feet, including 7,000 square feet of retail, a pool deck, 36 studio units, 144 one-bedroom units and 30 two-bedroom units. Units will range in size from 560 square feet to 1,100 square feet. The design team includes Mexico-based architect Enrique Norten of Ten Arquitectos and Miami-based Beilinson Gomez Architects.\nLocal attorney Neisen Kadsin is representing the project, and told the outlet the new zoning would increase the floor-area ratio and up the allowable height to 150 feet.\n\n\u201cEveryone in the city has identified this as a need, not luxury condos but market-rate residential,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cIt\u2019s a realistic project that could be developed in a relatively short period of time for a much-needed market-rate rental product that will be affordable for many of the people who work there.\u201d\nThe rezoning requires two votes of approval from the City Commission and for the Historic Preservation Board to review the site plan.\nRecords show Cejas bought the majority of the\nLincoln Road\nblock for $14.5 million in 1997. Cejas, a longtime Democratic fundraiser, was ambassador to Belgium from 1998 to 2001, according to published reports. In 2020, he sold his waterfront Star Island mansion for\n$20.1 million\n. In April, he dropped $8.4 million on a Park Avenue condo in Manhattan,\nCrain\u2019s New York\nreported.\n\u2013\u2013\nKate Hinsche",

Wright updated the six-bedroom, 6,350-square-foot home in his Prairie style, turning the home 90 degrees in the process, as reported in\nCrain\u2019s\n. The asking price for the 313 Forest Avenue home is just shy of $2.3 million. Wright also added two verandas on the first floor and updated the home\u2019s siding to stucco with dark wood trim.\nThe home has a long history of renovations and other unique details: a fire in 1976 caused during a restoration project burned most of the first floor, according to the Frank Lloyd Wright Trust. Also on the one-third acre property stands a ticket booth from the 1893 World\u2019s Columbian Exposition, held 20 miles away in Jackson Park. It was first used by the Hills family as a children\u2019s playhouse.\n\nThe previous owners restored the home from the fire and updated its utilities, and the windows are recreations of the original glass style. The kitchen was also expanded to modern preferences from what had been a small galley kitchen, opening up smaller rooms to pair it with a breakfast room. The basement was also updated for entertainment. The current owners also added a walled, private patio in the backyard.\nBoth the living room fireplace and the primary bedroom fireplace feature narrow, horizontal Roman bricks, and built-in bookcases are featured throughout. The sunroom on the first floor was previously an open-air porch, but now has windows with views of other Wright homes in the area, such as the original home Moore commissioned Wright to design in 1895 in the Tudor style.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The debt, from University Place Asset Management and Axonic Capital, amounts to nearly $3 million per unit.\nThe developer, One Turtle Creek LLC, is a joint venture between Swiss wealth advisory firm SVAG and USA Infrastructure Investments.\nThe deal refinanced the previous construction loan and provided the needed capital required to complete the 18-story project.\nThe units are expected to be priced from $3 million to $20 million, spanning 2,000 to 6,380 square feet. Its amenities will include views of the Dallas skyline, a private garden, infinity pool, dog park, pet spa and library.\n\nThe building will be managed by Rosewood Hotels &amp; Resorts.

        "content": "Thousands of housing units, missed deadlines and another boost for federal housing tax credits.\nThese describe some of the major housing-related headlines of the week. Thrilling, right?\nThe first refers to the\nMidtown South rezoning\n, which could pave the way for roughly 9,500 new housing units over the next decade. This week, City Council carved out some midblock properties in the Garment District and reduced residential density allowed in the southeast portion of the rezoning in a nod to the manufacturers still operating in the neighborhood. The changes reduced housing projections by 140-ish units.\nThe fact that the Garment District carveout only affects portions of the midblocks is key.\nTo exempt all midblock areas on West 36th and 40th streets between Seventh and Eighth avenues would have eliminated a lot more housing opportunities. By my count, at least 458 units of projected housing across six properties would have been shaved off the production numbers estimated by City Planning if residential was removed from all the midblocks in that area (the City Council subcommittee meeting on Wednesday made it sound like that was the change).\nThe language for the modifications was released Thursday night, which cleared things up a bit, but not before I printed out maps of Midtown South and highlighted the properties on the midblocks where housing would be lost, like a crazy person.\nAnyway, some have questioned the wisdom of the carveout, even if it is more surgical than what had previously been proposed.\n\u201cThis area has long since ceased to include any meaningful manufacturing activity, let alone garment factories or assembly,\u201d Herrick\u2019s Mitch Korbey tells me. \u201cThe Planning Commission saw this and appropriately called for a rezoning \u2014 we should trust and abide by the thoughtful and careful planning work done by the experts.\u00a0 Maintaining manufacturing zoning where no manufacturing jobs or activity exists is not sound planning \u2014 it simply will keep vacant or under-utilized buildings that could have a new and vibrant life as apartments and affordable housing.\u201d\nCouncil members said the changes were made to preserve the area\u2019s unique ecosystem of businesses and ensure \u201cnew housing and new business growth can thrive side-by-side.\u201d\nAlso this week, the state held a meeting about the megadevelopment Pacific Park that \u2014\u00a0by the state\u2019s own deadlines \u2014\u00a0should have involved discussions about a newly approved development team for the project. Alas, the meeting was largely about why the meeting was\nnot\nabout the newly approved developers.\nEmpire State Development previously said that a new development team would be approved and the development rights for six of the Pacific Park sites transferred by August 1. That didn\u2019t happen, according to state officials, because the proposed development team \u2014\u00a0Cirrus and LCOR \u2014\u00a0also submitted an application to take over another property known as Site 5. The officials said they need more time to review both takeover bids. They hope to finish this up sometime in September. Maybe. For a full rundown, check out my\nstory\n.\nAt the federal level, housing groups this week celebrated the Federal Housing Finance Agency\u2019s decision to raise the amount that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can invest in low-income housing tax credits. Each can now invest $2 billion, up from the $1 billion cap set last year.\n\nThe change comes after the \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d reconciliation bill expanded the tax credits. Per the National Housing Conference\u2019s David Dworkin, the increase is an important complement to the credit expansion, because it will help \u201censure that the market will absorb the additional credits without diminishing their value.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: What questions do you have for the mayoral candidates that haven\u2019t been addressed in their various public events and interviews? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The number of listings submitted to local listing services between June 11 (when the FARE Act went into effect) and July 31 has dropped 74 percent year-over-year,\nTRD\n\u2019s\nSheridan Wall reports\n.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 The DOJ has subpoenaed New York Attorney General Letitia James, the\nNew York Times\nreports. The investigation concerns two separate cases from James\u2019 office: the suit in which President Trump and his organization were found liable for fraud, and a case regarding the National Rifle Association\u2019s tax fraud. This follows the FBI\u2019s probe into the AG\u2019s real estate dealings.\n\u2014 Andrew Cuomo presented his affordability plan during a press conference on Thursday, comparing his agenda with Zohran Mamdani\u2019s, which he called irresponsible and unrealistic,\namNY\nreports. Cuomo outlined his plans for transportation, groceries, wages and taxes. This is the second briefing of its kind, following Monday\u2019s discussion of crime and public safety.\n\u2014 Mayor Eric Adams opened a new campaign office in Mill Basin. One problem: the building has a full vacate order still in place, according to\nthe City\n. In 2023, the parapet of the building collapsed, leading the Department of Buildings to issue the vacancy order that\u2019s still in effect. Though the wall has been repaired, the building will need to be reinspected before the campaign office can open. \u2014\nQuinn Waller\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$22 million\nfor a condominium unit at 520 Park Avenue. The Lenox Hill condo is a new-construction unit and 4,700 square feet.\nPeter Ashe\u2019s\nAsher Alcobi and Meirav Gavrielov have the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$13.3 million\nfor a development site at\u00a0 20-35 130th Street. Manhattan developer\nTurnbridge Equities\npurchased the 103,000-square-foot Queens lot.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $2.9 million for a condo unit at 2505 Broadway. The Upper West Side condo is 1,300 square feet.\nThe Agency\nhas the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for a proposed 95,238-square-foot, six-story, mixed-use building at 444 Carroll Street in Brooklyn. Architect Kao Hwa Lee is the applicant of record.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

        "content": "Overall, there were 192 deals, totaling about $316 million, recorded in New York City on Friday, Aug. 8.\n\ud83c\udfc6Residential:\nThe top residential sale recorded in New York City was for a condominium unit in Lenox Hill. A full-floor pad at Billionaires\u2019 Row property\n520 Park Avenue\ntraded between anonymous LLCs for $22 million, more than 15 percent off its last sale price of $22 million in 2019. Measuring more than 4,600 square feet, the residence\u2019s purchase price works out to nearly $4,800 per square foot. The seller listed the condo for sale in April with Peter Ashe\u2019s\nAsher Alcobi\nand\nMerav Gavrielov\nfor just under $27 million.\n\ud83c\udfc6Commercial:\nThe priciest commercial transaction recorded in the Big Apple was in College Point.\nZano Industries\n, a trucking company that had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year, parted with a parking facility spanning three parcels at\n20-15 130th Street\nfor $20 million. The buyer was an affiliate of New York-based\nTurnbridge Equities\n.\n\ud83d\udccaResidential:\nOn the Upper East Side, a townhouse at\n163 East 78th Street\nchanged hands for $12.7 million. The buyer was a trust tied to Hollywood manager\nAnna DerParseghian\n, and the seller was a company linked to\nRobert Gregory Eisner\nand\nMalda Nadi Hibri\n, who paid $11 million for the 36-foot-wide single-family home in 2021. The property measures more than 5,300 square feet, with five bedrooms and a garden. It went up for sale in May for $13.5 million. Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s\nSerena Boardman\nhad the listing.\n\ud83d\udccaResidential: Heather and Jordan Ouida\n, an entrepreneur and finance executive, respectively, sold a condo at\n150 East 86th Street\non the Upper East Side to\nAdeel and Vedica Qalbani\n. Adeel Qualbani is a managing partner at Perry Creek Capital, and Vedica Qalbani is the CEO of Ratio Advisors. The price was $7.8 million. The Ouidas purchased the unit for about $7.4 million in 2012.\n\ud83d\udccaCommercial:\nTwo LLCs, one tied to attorney\nMichael Utevsky\nand the other to\nLawrence Berger\n, also an attorney, sold a mixed-use property at\n165 Sherman Avenue\nfor just under $9 million; they had owned the building for decades. The buyer was a holding company managed by landlord\nDemetrios Moragianis\n.\nThe building stands six stories tall and has 100 apartments and ground-floor retail.\n\n\ud83d\udccaCommercial:\nIn Washington Heights, an affiliate of\nMilbrook Properties\noffloaded a six-story multifamily building with 43 apartments and ground-floor retail for about $5.9 million.

        "content": "Want to see what prepared looks like?\nTake a glance at the\nAECOM\npresentation given to Pacific Palisades residents Thursday evening during an over two-hour community meeting. Specific actions and timelines for deliverables were offered to residents. That cuts a stark contrast to the April debacle when a representative from\nHagerty Consulting\nspoke to residents, but was unable to answer questions around what the Chicago outfit had done in relation to infrastructure, public health and community outreach.\nHagerty\u2019s Chicago headquarters has been a point of contention for some, who think a local will do what\u2019s best for locals. Maybe the AECOM reps at Thursday\u2019s meeting heard that and meant to take a shot when Matt Talley, senior vice president and client account manager at AECOM, told residents, \u201cOur U.S. business is based here in Los Angeles, and I\u2019ll just repeat that. We\u2019re based in Los Angeles and so we\u2019re part of the community.\u201d\nPowerPoint to PowerPoint, AECOM outlined more than 15 meetings with city divisions such as the Department of Water and Power and the Los Angeles Police Department; over 10 community meetings; and outlined its plans for infrastructure restoration, future fire protection and logistics and traffic management. The Hagerty presentation talked up a \u201cstructured approach\u201d to rebuilding, \u201cresilience as an emerging recovery focus\u201d and \u201crecovery support functions.\u201d\nOn fire rebuild fees, Measure ULA\nPermit fees\nand taxes continue to make their way into rebuild discussions. Final decisions are hard to come by.\nCouncil member Traci Park, whose district includes the Palisades, revealed a lengthy document during Thursday\u2019s Palisades community meeting, called the \u201cPacific Palisades Vision.\u201d\nPark described the \u201cvision document\u201d as the culmination of months of conversations with residents at town halls, community meetings and other events.\nAmong her thoughts was an acknowledgement of the need to waive fees for property owners and renters. Park\u2019s stance on this is not new. Her motion passed earlier this year by the city\u2019s Ad Hoc Committee for L.A. Recovery needs to move through the Budget and Finance Committee next before consideration by the full Los Angeles City Council. Currently, the city has stopped collecting permit fees, but that is not permanent.\nThe idea could face a potentially uphill battle.\n\u201cThere is about a $90 million impact to the general fund to waive those fees,\u201d Park told residents during Thursday\u2019s meeting. \u201cThere will be discussion amongst my [city council] colleagues about whether we can do it. Can we afford to do it? Should we do it?\u201d\nPark made clear her opinion that permit fees should be done away with regardless of whether someone is building the same exact footprint or not.\nPark also acknowledged in her vision document what she called the \u201cdetrimental effects\u201d of the\nMeasure United to House L.A.\n2022 ballot measure, a property tax which applies to all real estate transactions in the city starting at $5.3 million. Those in real estate say it\u2019s done nothing but chill deals and development. In the Palisades it could prove another hurdle in the recovery.\nPark said she\u2019s working with L.A. Mayor Karen Bass and state lawmakers on a possible solution.\nNew attitudes on modular, prefab housing\nIt\u2019s not as though a raft of wildfire victims are enlisting modular or pre-fab housing manufacturers to get them back on their lots and inside\nfaster\nand cheaper. However, it\u2019s worth noting there\u2019s a growing contingent going that route.\nAbout 28 percent of those surveyed in late spring and early summer by Park\u2019s office in the Palisades said they\u2019re considering modular or prefab construction.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re hearing constantly are identical stories: People seeking us out because they\u2019re underinsured and they\u2019re looking for alternative ways to build aside from timber,\u201d said Mary O\u2019Brien, Hapi Homes\u2019 CEO and co-founder.\nHapi Homes has 30 rebuild clients in Altadena and Pasadena. RSG 3-D is counting between 40 and 50 homeowners who have architects and intend to use the company\u2019s panelized materials. Hapi Homes and RSG 3-D are what\u2019s known as\nmakers of panelized housing\nthat come in kits assembled on site at a resident\u2019s lot.\nWarring construction quotes\nAsk anyone how much it\u2019s going to cost to rebuild a home burned in the Palisades or Eaton fires and you\u2019ll get a different answer. That quote\u2019s also likely to change next month and the month after that.\nStill,\nOpus Builders\u2019 Gary Mkrtichyan\ncan\u2019t make some of the math on rebuilds that he\u2019s hearing pencil out. While Opus Builders \u2014 a construction company with its own in-house architecture and design services \u2014 charges $550 to $600 per square foot, Mkrtichyan hears all about some firms charging $700, $750 and beyond.\nPalisades residents estimated their construction costs averaging $800 per square foot in an Urban Land Institute-sponsored survey in the spring, while Altadena\u2019s mean was $580 per square foot.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not one client that I\u2019m charging $700 a square foot,\u201d Mkrtichyan said. \u201cI built three homes in the Palisades prior to the fires below that number. Now, OK, I understand there\u2019s been some appreciation. There\u2019s a labor shortage, especially with ICE [raids], but I know this is not the reason for these numbers people are talking about.\u201d\nBrad Pitt heads to Hollywood Hills\nBrad Pitt\n\u2019s moving, and so is The Killers guitarist Dave Keuning.\nThe \u201cF1 The Movie\u201d star earlier this week paid $12 million for a Hollywood Hills home sold by Keuning and his wife and interior designer Emilie Keuning.\nThat was a nice, double-ended deal for Carolwood Estates.\nThe Beverly Hills brokerage\u2019s David Parnes, Sam Collins and James Harris represented the Keunings. Meanwhile, Carolwood\u2019s Marci Kays and Jonathan Mogharrabi represented Pitt.\nMalibu\u2019s $80M trade\nAnyone have more details on the $80 million sale of\n28719 Grayfox Street\nin Malibu?\nThe multiparcel deal traded off market last month, per the deed, but it has limited liability companies on both sides of the transaction.\nAlso unclear is if the buyer and seller were represented by any agents in the deal, which is so far the priciest trade on record in Malibu this year.\nThe property consists of a 1.4-acre lot with a 1,300-square-foot residence, while the other lot is empty.\n",

        "content": "A Tom Ford, Moncler and Balenciaga-leased property on Rodeo Drive\nsold\nfor more than $400 million.\nRonan McNamee\u2019s ECA Capital Limited was the seller. The company purchased the 28,000-square-foot property at 338 North Rodeo Drive for $81.5 million in 2007 \u2014 and McNamee refinanced the property at $160 million six years ago. The identity of the buyer wasn\u2019t immediately known.\nThe deal is believed to be the second-highest sale ever in Beverly Hills, after Nicholas and Christian Candy\u2019s $500 million purchase of what was once a Robinson\u2019s-May department store in 2007. The 338 North Rodeo Drive sale could be a one-property record for the famed street, and the building may have fetched the lavish price because of its development potential.\nOther pricey retail sales along the iconic street include LVMH\u2019s $245 million purchase of a 22,300-square-foot, two-story double lot at 468 North Rodeo Drive; hotelier Efrem Harkham\u2019s $200 million sale of the 43,000-square-foot lot that held a boutique hotel plus three retail stores at 360 North Rodeo Drive; and Crown Equity\u2019s Michael Shabani\u2019s purchase of two storefronts spanning 11,600 square feet at 457-459 North Rodeo Drive for $112 million.\nCaruso for small businesses\nBillionaire Rick Caruso\u2019s nonprofit\nannounced\na $1 million donation from Banc of California\u2019s Wildfire Relief &amp; Recovery Fund for small businesses.\nThe small business initiative aims to support retailers, restaurants and other businesses in Altadena, Malibu and the Pacific Palisades impacted by the wildfires earlier this year via direct grants of up to $50,000.\n\u201cThese small businesses were about much more than commercial or economic activity. They were local hallmarks that gave neighborhoods their soul and fostered a sense of community,\u201d Caruso said. \u201cWe cannot abandon them. This is about ensuring they have the tools, resources and support they need to come back.\u201d\nThe businessman and once mayoral candidate\u2019s Pacific Palisades mall survived the fires thanks to private firefighters, but is closed because of the devastation surrounding it.\n\u201cThese businesses aren\u2019t faceless storefronts. They are the fabric of the community,\u201d Caruso said. \u201cThey are made up of people: owners, employees and loyal customers. They deserve an advocate to help address the challenges they\u2019re facing through no fault of their own. Through this initiative, they\u2019ll have one.\u201d\nMore losses at Hudson Pacific Properties\nHudson Pacific Properties has fallen on hard times.\nThe company\nreported\nan $83 million loss for the second quarter compared to a $47 million loss a year earlier.\nRevenues decreased to $190 million from $218 million a year ago because of declining office occupancies and discounted asset sales \u2014 that includes a San Francisco office building the company sold earlier this summer for $28 million, about half the $56.5 million Hudson Pacific purchased it for a decade ago.\nThe real estate investment trust\u2019s office revenues fell to $156 million in the three months ending June 30, compared to $176 million during the same period last year. Production studio revenues fared worse too, dropping to $34 million from $42 million year-over-year.\nHudson Pacific chair and CEO Victor Coleman, whose total compensation was valued at about $25 million last year despite ballooning losses, hinted at offloading more properties in the future and commended leasing during the company\u2019s earnings call.\n\nHudson Pacific executed 558,000 square feet in leases in the second quarter, a small increase from a year earlier. Second-quarter leases included a six-year, 77,000-square-foot renewal with a cybersecurity company in Foster City; a nine-year, 41,000-square-foot renewal with a digital sports company in Los Angeles; and a six-year, 32,000-square-foot new lease with a bio-tech company in Palo Alto.\nOffice-to-resi in Westood\nDouglas Emmett\nplans\nto turn an office tower it purchased for $131 million from Tishman Speyer through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure into apartments.\nThe 17-story, 247,000-square-foot office building at 10900 Wilshire Boulevard, coupled with a residential building Douglas Emmett plans to construct on the same lot, is set to become a 320-apartment complex in Westwood. The real estate investment trust\u2019s CEO, Jordan Kaplan, said he expects the conversion to enhance the property\u2019s value during its second-quarter earnings call. Still, the conversion will occur over an undisclosed number of years as offices are vacated on a floor-by-floor basis \u2014 and anticipated costs have increased.\n\u201cIncluding the costs to acquire the property, convert the existing office tower and construct the new building, we expect this plan to increase the total project costs to approximately $200 million to $250 million,\u201d the company said in an earnings release.\nBefore the planned conversion, the company expected the cost to be $150 million to $200 million, and that would include the acquisition, construction of the apartment building and upgrades to the existing tower.\nA loyal law firm\nLaw firm Behar Gibbs Savage Paulson\nrenewed\nits about 36,000-square-foot lease across two floors at One World Trade Center in Long Beach.\nBehar Gibbs Savage Paulson has occupied the top two floors of the 27-story, approximately 575,000-square-foot building for the last 35 years. The building\u2019s asking rents are between $2.95 to $3.15 per square foot per month.\nSince 2023, Los Angeles office absorption has been increasingly dominated by law firms and financial companies. The two years before, technology and entertainment companies led the way.\nFisher Phillips inked a new lease for about 36,000 square feet at 515 South Flower Street in Downtown Los Angeles \u2014 and an almost 14,000-square-foot lease at 21600 Oxnard Street in Woodland Hills last week. Paul Hastings, Hill, Farrer &amp; Burrill, Hanson Bridgett and Mayer Brown have renewed or signed new leases Downtown in recent years, too.\nArts District\u2019s all-in-one\nThe Los Angeles City Council\ngave\nthe green light for Danish architect Bjarke Ingels\u2019 mixed-use high-rise development in the Arts District.\nThe project at 670 Mesquit Street, which has been in the works for almost a decade, is set to hold four interconnected towers, the tallest of which would be 34 stories. The developer, Vella Group, plans to build 676,000 square feet of office space; 894 residential units; a 271-room hotel; a charter elementary school; and commercial spaces for retail, restaurant and art galleries.\nThe mixed-use campus will replace the Rancho Cold Storage facility owned for years by the Gallo family. Construction is expected to take place either over a single five-year period or in separate phases over nine years. A completion date has not yet been announced but total cost is estimated at $1.4 billion.\nIt was initially proposed as an office-heavy development but has shifted to mostly housing.\n",

        "content": "When U.S. Rep. Danny Davis announced he was not running for re-election, he became the third Congress person representing Illinois to do so this year. And because two U.S. Representatives are running to fill retiring U.S. Senator Dick Durbin\u2019s seat, a fourth position may end up vacant as well.\nThe Congressional shake up comes at a time when real estate players have a lot on the line. While rent growth in Chicago is\nbrewing a hot multifamily market,\nsluggish construction starts indicate that developers and lenders aren\u2019t as active as they could be. At the same time, Chicago\u2019s office market is stuck in a rut, reporting a record high 27 percent vacancy rate in the second quarter of this year. And the suburban office market\nisn\u2019t faring much better.\nAs a result, the industry is keeping a close watch on any potential political changes on the horizon.\nReal estate scion Jason Friedman\nposted the first fundraising numbers in the race to replace Davis and is coming away as an early favorite of the industry.\nProminent donors include Waterton CEO David Schwartz, Private Investment billionaire Craig Duchossois, CRG CEO Shawn Clark among others.\nDavis\u2019 district is of significant interest to real estate because it includes much of the Loop and Fulton Market.\n\nFriedman, son of prolific River North developer Albert Friedman, appears to be downplaying his ties to the business while campaigning. A press release characterized his $1 million fundraising haul as a collection of donations from \u201ccommunity leaders and grassroots supporters.\u201d And his website refers to his Chicagoan grandfather and great grandfather, but skips over his father, whose company he served as president of from 2005 until 2023.\nIn a Q&amp;A with\nThe Real Deal\n, however,\nFriedman embraced his industry experience\n.\nThe race ahead of the March 17 primaries will be where the real action plays out because the district is considered safely Democratic.\nAt least eight other challengers have recently joined the race, including state Rep. La Shawn Ford, who Davis endorsed last week. When the newer candidates report their fundraising totals next quarter,\u00a0 the results will likely reveal more nuances about other coalitions forming.\nMeanwhile, at the city level, it\u2019s politics as usual.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s administration\nclosed two investigations\nby the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development into the city of Chicago\u2019s zoning practices, a move that will likely end recent efforts to reform the informal practice of \u201caldermanic prerogative.\u201d\nLocal housing advocates had hoped the federal investigations would lead to reforming or ending aldermen\u2019s control over zoning in their respective wards. The investigations stemmed from a 2018 lawsuit that alleged such control led to racial segregation and dampened affordable housing development in wealthy, predominately white neighborhoods.\nThe city had already entered a voluntary agreement to negotiate a resolution after federal housing authorities found merit in the claims. Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s administration was reportedly near an agreement at the end of last year, but negotiations tapered off after Trump took office.",

        "content": "South San Francisco might stand as a shining beacon on a hill \u2014 or rather, several hills \u2014 for multifamily construction in the Bay Area.\nThe Peninsula city is\nbucking a trend\nof lagging apartment starts in the region with three large-scale residential projects underway. The latest proof of confidence from a lender came last month when Trammell Crow Residential secured a $183 million construction loan for its 480-unit Alexan Icon project at 1587 and 1588 San Mateo Avenue.\nTwo other large apartment developments have also broken ground in South San Francisco. Syres Properties is developing 400 units at 410 Noor Avenue while Essex Property Trust is building nearly 550 units at 7 South Linden Avenue.\n\u201cIt\u2019s significant that South San Francisco has three large multifamily developments underway,\u201d Nell Selander, economic and community development director for the city of South San Francisco, told the\nSan Francisco Business Times\n.\nNationwide and across the Bay Area, construction starts for apartment projects are at their slowest pace in 15 years, Jesse Gundersheim, senior director of market analytics at CoStar, told the Business Times.\nFarther south in Sunnyvale, a 147-unit apartment complex sold for nearly $70 million, pointing to possible increased demand for already-existing housing in Peninsula cities south of San Francisco.\nThe 5-acre\nCitra\napartment complex sale marked a more than $40 million profit from its 2014 price of $27 million. The property sold to San Francisco-based Prime Finance for $68.5 million, or about $466,000 per unit, higher than the five-year average multifamily property price in Santa Clara County of about $458,000 for such developments.\nSan Francisco rents bounce back post-pandemic\nFive years on from the pandemic, rents in San Francisco have nearly recovered all losses.\nMedian rental prices for two-bedroom apartments in San Francisco have surpassed levels from before the pandemic\u2019s outbreak, according to a new report from\nZumper\n. Last month, two-bedrooms in the city climbed to a monthly median listing price of $4,780, marking the highest point since August 2019. Median rents for one-bedrooms are close to reaching the same threshold at $3,400 per month, just under the $3,500 rate pre-pandemic.\nAn influx of new tech workers, likely driven by the proliferation of artificial intelligence company offices in the city, played a key part in the recent increase, according to Zumper spokesperson Crystal Chen. That sentiment is shared by AvalonBay Communities COO Sean Breslin, who\ntold investors\nin May that\nreturn-to-office mandates\nimproved public safety and AI-driven job growth has increased housing demand \u2014 and as a result, rents.\nSan Mateo skyline poised for transformation\nSan Mateo could soon claim a\nnew tallest tower\nin the city.\nMike Field of Mecah Ventures has filed formal permits to build a 14-story building at 1 East 4th Avenue in downtown San Mateo. The tower is projected to stand at 202 feet tall, edging out an office complex across the street at 400 South El Camino Real, also 14 stories tall but 165 feet high.\nPlans call for 174,700 square feet of housing and 119,760 square feet of commercial space with subterranean parking for 171 cars and 283 bicycles. The building would boast ground-floor retail, housing on the lower 10 floors, and offices on the top four floors with access to a rooftop balcony.\n\nOf the 236 rental units planned, 36 would be deed-restricted as affordable housing. Residents would have on-site amenities like a private lounge, spa, fitness center and a golf simulator.\nIf approved, the structure wouldn\u2019t be the tallest building in San Mateo County. That title belongs to the 317-foot-tall Genesis North Tower in South San Francisco, though N17\u2019s proposed 458-foot-tall building as part of its Willow Park mixed-use development in Menlo Park could beat it out.\nNvidia plants flag at Mission Rock\nMission Rock is set to receive another major tenant: the world\u2019s most valuable company.\nNvidia is reportedly\nin talks\nto lease 45,000 square feet in the eight-story office building at the site in Mission Bay, joining Coinbase and the Golden State Warriors at the tower.\nAs the company\u2019s value balloons past $4 trillion, the Santa Clara-based chipmaker has been growing its footprint in the Bay Area. This year alone, it\ndropped $123 million\nfor a 10-building office campus across the street from its Santa Clara headquarters and additionally\nbought a 500,000-square-foot\n, four-building office complex in the South Bay city.\nThe move has been in the works for some time, as the company was reportedly looking for a 30,000-square-foot sales office in San Francisco in May, according to the\nSan Francisco Chronicle\n.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang is doubling down on San Francisco, home to artificial intelligence giants OpenAI and Anthropic,\nsaying\nthe city is \u201cthriving again\u2026 all because of AI.\u201d\nThe AI sector is expected to gobble up 21 million square feet of offices and attract as many as 60,000 new employees to San Francisco over the next five years, according to a report from\nCBRE\n.\nSaratoga winery to become cemetery\nSavannah-Chanelle Vineyards in Santa Clara County is headed for a spooky redevelopment.\nLongtime owners Michael and Kellie Ballard sold the 57.9-acre winery outside Saratoga to the Saratoga Cemetery District for $20 million.\nThe cemetery manager has been preparing to expand in the area. In April, the district\nbought\na house next to Madronia Cemetery for $4.5 million. But the district has had its eye on the Savannah-Chanelle land for some time.\n\u201cThis is the one we\u2019ve always wanted,\u201d Steve Albright, general manager of Madronia Cemetery, told the\nSan Francisco Business Journal\nof the vineyard purchase. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on this one for about a year.\u201d\nThe\nSaratoga\nCemetery District will spend the next 20 years paying off debt to secure the property as it prepares to turn the nearly 60-acre plot into another cemetery. The winery won\u2019t be going anywhere for a while, though; the Cemetery District is leasing the property to Savannah-Chanelle, which will continue to operate for at least the next 10 years before the cemetery takes over and redevelops the land.\n",

        "content": "North of Dallas, a controversial master-planned community called EPIC City is in the works \u2014 a vision led by Imran Chaudhary to create a multigenerational Muslim neighborhood anchored by a mosque.\nTexas Bureau Chief Jess Hardin took a\ndeep dive into EPIC City\nfor the\nAugust issue\nof\nThe Real Deal\nmagazine.\nThe 400-acre project, named after the East Plano Islamic Center, aims to address housing affordability and cultural cohesion, but it\u2019s drawn fierce backlash from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and right-wing influencers who\u2019ve baselessly claimed the community would impose Sharia law.\nDespite the political firestorm and investigations by multiple state agencies, EPIC City\u2019s backers have pressed on, selling $40 million worth of shares to fund the development. While religious communities like Ave Maria in Florida and Veritatis Splendor in East Texas have developed with less scrutiny, EPIC City has become a flashpoint in the debate over who gets to build faith-based communities in America.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice closed its investigation into the community in June, and the developers plan to submit formal proposals to county officials by year\u2019s end.\nTRD\nTexas Reporter Isaiah Mitchell\u2019s magazine piece this month dug into the explosive growth in the country\u2019s fastest-growing town, Princeton, through the\nstory of one entrepreneur\nwho\u2019s making a mark there.\n\nFormer Dallas Mavericks player-turned-country singer Ray Johnston stumbled into a goldmine when he bought 138 acres outside of Princeton just before the town started blowing up. But he also did a ton of work on the ground. Johnston navigated local resistance by personally securing 26 easements from wary neighbors, smoothing the path for sewer lines and a profitable land sale to homebuilders like Lennar. His charm offensive \u2014 which included gift baskets and guitar pick-shaped business cards \u2014 paid off, turning a passive investment into a hands-on win as Princeton grappled with infrastructure lags and development pressure.\nHere\u2019s what else happened in Texas real estate this week:\nFresh off a $343 million capital raise, Dallas-based multifamily syndicator S2 Capital is expanding into industrial real estate with the\nacquisition of Fort Capital\nand its 11 million-square-foot portfolio. The move, driven by e-commerce demand and transportation costs, adds a new vertical led by Chris Roach and Parker McCormack, as S2 continues navigating market volatility better than many of its syndicator peers.\nOne Riverway, an office building in Houston\u2019s Galleria area, is still hemorrhaging tenants despite a recent recap deal to avoid foreclosure.

        "content": "The Ghermezian family is still chasing the American Dream in Miami.\nTo the average person, it seems like the planned $4 billion, 6 million-square-foot entertainment and retail center in South Florida might never get built. It\u2019s been seven years since Miami-Dade County commissioners approved a massive rezoning that paved the way for the project.\nThe project, which was supposed to be completed in 2022, hasn\u2019t gotten off the ground.\nFrancisco Alvarado\nlooks at why and what\u2019s next for the development in our latest issue.\nThe mall is facing legal challenges, and the developer says it needs the county to lift its ban on Triple Five securing subsidies that would help pay for road construction. The latter could be addressed by the county commission next month.\nThe project is pretty ambitious \u2014 Triple Five Group, led by cousins Paul and Don Ghermezian, plans to transform 175 acres sandwiched between two major highways in Miami-Dade into a water park, 3-D cinema multiplex, 2,000 hotel rooms and (I saved the best part for last) a 16-story indoor ski slope. It would be larger than the Ghermezians\u2019 Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, which is the biggest mall in the U.S.\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like the Ghermezians are too concerned. Miami-Dade filed a lawsuit against the developer earlier this year, and Triple Five agreed to pay a $5 million penalty in four installments beginning next year. As part of the settlement, Triple Five now has until 2045 to complete the project \u2014 so 20 years from now.\nPaul Ghermezian confirmed the company\u2019s long-term strategy in an\ninterview\nwith\nThe Real Deal\nearlier this year.\nPlus, there\u2019s the issue of\u2026 who else would build it?\nShlomo Chopp with Case Equity Partners said it\u2019s either them, or Disney.\n\u201cDisney already has Orlando,\u201d Chopp said.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat would you like to see in the 2045 version of American Dream Miami?

Five of those properties are in Broward and Palm Beach counties, three are in Kissimmee, one is in Tampa and another is in Charleston.

        "content": "Manhattan\u2019s ultra-rich found better things to do last week than sign on the dotted line.\nJust nine homes in the borough asking $4 million or more\nsnagged inked deals\nlast week, per Olshan Realty\u2019s report. The drop in contracts mirrored a similar slump in South Florida, with Miami-Dade County logging just 12 pending deals.\nThe drop could mean luxury buyers are just out on summer vacation or it could be the first inkling of a glacial third quarter \u2014 typically the residential market\u2019s slowest period.\nBut the number of signed contracts could also be undercounted, as the total may not include homes marketed as private exclusives or deals inked off-market at new development properties such as 80 Clarkson.\nThe jury\u2019s still out on how the rest of August will fare, but contract activity in Manhattan was off to a strong start ahead of the month. In July, the number of pending deals for condos, co-ops and one- to three-family homes asking $4 million or more rose to 91, up more than 12 percent compared to the same month last year, according to Miller Samuel\u2019s monthly report.\nThe uptick in signed contracts will likely translate to closed deals in the third quarter, but luxury activity outpaced new listings hitting the market during the month. Without enough inventory for buyers to scoop up, a deal slowdown could be on the horizon.\nNew listings for homes asking $4 million or more fell 13 percent last month, dropping from 129 to 112.\nThe Upper East Side notched the largest number of recorded transactions in July, with 193 deals, according to data from Streeteasy. The deals came after an active June in the neighborhood\u2019s luxury market, which saw 36 contracts inked, up 16 percent from the same month last year.\nNot so fast\u2026\n\nResidential brokerages closed out the second quarter earnings season with mixed results.\nThree of the sector\u2019s largest firms found different footing as macroeconomic conditions, including persistently high mortgage rates and uncertainty sparked by tariffs, slowed the housing market.\nCompass\nfinished the period\nin the black, reporting more than $39 million in net income \u2014 a 90 percent year-over-year increase compared to the same quarter last year, according to its earnings report. The company also logged record quarterly revenue at more than $2 billion, a 21 percent annual uptick.\nWhile Compass posted gains, Anywhere Real Estate\nheld the line\n. The parent company of brands such as Corcoran, Coldwell Banker and Sotheby\u2019s International reported a net income of $27 million, just $3 million less than it earned in the same period in 2024. Its revenue was $1.7 billion, up 1 percent from the second quarter last year.\nBut Douglas Elliman\u2019s earnings\ntook a turn\nfor the worst. The firm posted a $23 million loss \u2014 $21 million more than it lost in the second quarter last year \u2014 and reversed months of revenue gains, bringing in $270 million compared to $285 million in 2024. The period was a departure from the upward trajectory Elliman started on in the first quarter.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe priciest sale to land in the city register this week was a three-bedroom resale at Extell Development and Aabar Investment\u2019s 157 West 57th Street. Unit 66B at the Billionaires\u2019 Row tower, known as One57, traded for $24 million \u2014 $2 million below its asking price when it hit the market in April. The 4,200-square-foot condo sold for $19 million in 2021.\nMichael Balanevsky and Artur Fruman of Accent Holdings had the listing.\n",

        "content": "For rent-stabilized buildings whose finances have collapsed, owners might have only one way out: deregulation through demolition or substantial rehabilitation.\nOwners are increasingly asking about this, according to a\nLinkedIn post\nby real estate lawyer Sherwin Belkin.\nHis message could be an attempt to drum up business, but Belkin says he is \u201cabsolutely getting many more inquiries.\u201d There is every reason to believe him.\nNot only is distress among rent-stabilized buildings rising (because\ninterest rates\nand\noperating costs\nhave risen, rent increases have\nlagged\nand\nhousing court is broken\n), but their outlook became even more dismal with the mayoral primary victory by Assembly member\nZohran Mamdani\n, who promises\nto freeze their rents\nfor four years.\nThe distress is concentrated in fully or largely rent-stabilized buildings. When Mamdani talks about landlords\u2019 profits rising 12 percent, he omits that this is driven by properties that have lucrative market-rate units mixed in. Purely rent-stabilized buildings are\ndoing much worse\n, in some cases declaring bankruptcy or facing\nforeclosure\n.\nAn uptick in inquiries about sub rehab and demolition, however, does not necessarily mean more projects are happening. Among the requirements: Buildings must be in bad physical condition and mostly vacant before the rehab begins (which is an incentive to not maintain a building).\nBuyouts backfire\nGetting approval from the state\u2019s Division of Homes and Community Renewal is difficult because the agency sees preserving affordable housing as part of its mission. Also, the legislature got rid of a policy that presumed buildings qualify if vacancy is at least 80 percent.\nThat change took effect Jan. 1, 2024, but even projects that began before that date are held to extraordinary scrutiny by HCR.\nTake 117 North Fourth Street in Williamsburg, which an entity called Creas Inc bought for $9.75 million in 2023 from an LLC linked to\nJeff Sutton\n\u2019s Wharton Properties, property records show. (Traded identified the buyer as the\nCras family\n.)\nJudging from the price and the building\u2019s history, the buyer assumed the 2022 sub-rehab application would be approved. The building was entirely vacant and the applicant had submitted photos of its poor condition before replacing more than the minimum 75 percent of its major systems.\n\nBut in January 2024, HCR denied the application, saying the rehab did not meet its\ncriteria\n. Remarkably, one reason given for the denial was that the three tenants who vacated had accepted buyouts ranging from $150,000 to $175,000.\nThese amounts, the agency claimed, proved that the apartments were valuable and not in bad shape \u2014 an absurd claim. The payouts were six figures because the building\u2019s value would triple if it could escape rent regulation, which required vacancy. If occupied, the units were worth little.\nThe agency also argued that the \u201cbefore\u201d photos were not dated and the locations of the captured images were not well documented, making it unclear that the four-story building was substandard or seriously deteriorated just before the renovation.\nState law says nothing about buyouts disqualifying a property. HCR\u2019s criteria don\u2019t even mention them. \u201cHaving bought a tenant out is not probative or even relevant to the physical condition of the building,\u201d said Belkin, who followed the case but was not involved in it.\nThe owner asked HCR to review its initial ruling, but the agency upheld it, as did\nstate Supreme Court Justice Gina Abadi\non July 1. Whether an appeal will succeed is anyone\u2019s guess.\nNo tenants had objected to the deregulation of 117 North Fourth Street. Rather, HCR decided on its own to rebut the presumption that the building\u2019s 100 percent vacancy did not make it eligible.\nBuyer in a bind\nThe court\u2019s\nruling\nthat the building shall remain rent-stabilized leaves Creas in a horrendous position. The buyer borrowed $6.1 million from Valley National Bank for the deal, but the most it could collect in rent \u2014 perhaps $150,000 a year \u2014 would only pay about half of the debt service. Operating expenses and property taxes would add to the red ink.\nCreas\u2019 $3.65 million down payment looks like a total loss. Valley National might lose even more. Whether it forecloses on the building or sells the loan, it can expect pennies on the dollar. The only winners here appear to be Sutton, whose firm paid $2.8 million for the unmortgaged building in July 2020, four months into the pandemic, and Andrzej Trojanowski, the seller in that deal.\nThis is a cautionary tale, but taking a shot at a sub rehab still makes sense if the alternative is watching a building\u2019s value decline until it becomes impossible to refinance or simply worthless.\nLandlords\u2019 strategy of asking the state legislature to amend the 2019\nHousing Stability and Tenant Protection Act\nhas not worked, outside of getting a modest rent increase for individual apartment improvements.\nThe upshot: If a sub rehab or demolition is a building\u2019s only way out of a\nfinancial death spiral\n, cutting corners on the application could be fatal. Better to hire an expert. Preferably someone who will date the photos.\n",

The firm\u2019s development arm focuses on industrial property in Texas, primarily in Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston, and the investment arm of the firm has industrial assets around the country.\nThe platform follows development firm Eider Creek Capital, a venture Doherty launched in 2020. Prior to these enterprises, Doherty spent 22 years at Crow Holdings, where he helped lead the company\u2019s investment team and grow its industrial and self-storage platforms. Doherty leads investment strategy, governance and capital formation at Eider Creek.\nHafner also comes from Crow Holdings, where he spent 12 years overseeing development, acquisitions and asset management. Between 2017 and 2018, Hafner was a partner at Panattoni Development Company. He oversees development and asset management.\n\nBaird has 30 years of cumulative experience at Cushman &amp; Wakefield, HFF and, most recently, CBRE, where he served as vice chair. At Eider Creek, Baird oversees portfolio planning, valuations and institutional capital.\nHere\u2019s what else is shaking in Texas real estate.\nCommercial real estate broker Cynthia Cowen joined Florida-based Foundry Commercial as senior vice president of the firm\u2019s Mission Property Group, a division that exclusively focuses on religious, educational and other mission-driven nonprofits. Cowen spent 15 years on a Cousins Properties team that was acquired by Cushman &amp; Wakefield, where she continued to work for over seven years. She left Cushman in May.\u00a0Commercial broker Mac Morse was awarded SIOR office designation from the Society of Industrial and Office Realtors recently, a formal recognition of a broker\u2019s experience, education and ethical reputation.

The house at 1680 North Doheny Drive had an original listing price of $43 million in January 2024,\nThe Real Deal\nreported.\nAn LLC connected to Australian developer Caydon Property Group developed the mansion, based on property records.\nPerched on a hillside with sweeping views of the Sunset Strip, the home is a modern architectural glass house designed by Vantage Design Group. Its technology-focused features include retractable glass walls, drought-tolerant landscaping, two elevators and climate-controlled wine rooms. The residence also features an eco-friendly solar system, eight bathrooms, five bedrooms and a media room with an LED wall and bar.\n\nGuo, who co-founded Scale AI in 2016 before launching her own platform, Passes, in 2022, has a net worth of $1.3 billion, according to Forbes. Her stake in Scale AI, which she retained after leaving the company in 2018 due to differences of opinion with co-founder Alexandr Wang, is now worth a fortune following the company\u2019s recent valuation surge. Meanwhile, Passes has raised $50 million in two years from investors.\nBarron and Tessa Hilton represented Guo in the deal, while Compass agents Ginger Glass and Craig Lotzof held the listing.\nThis is Guo\u2019s third known real estate purchase. In 2021, she bought a $6.7 million condominium in a Zaha Hadid-designed Miami tower. The 4,727-square-foot residence features four bedrooms, 5.5 bathrooms, a movie theater, rooftop helipad and beach views. In 2024, she picked up a modern farmhouse in L.A. for $4.2 million. It has 4,643 square feet with six bathrooms, a pool and a garage.\n\u2014Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "Actor Emma Stone has sold her renovated 1940s, seven-bedroom mansion, opting to stick with the hustle and bustle of Manhattan without ever giving the manse in Austin\u2019s genteel Tarrytown neighborhood a try.\nStone and her husband Dave McCary purchased the home off-market in 2021 with the intention to restore the property and then relocate the family to Austin, Realtor.com\nreports\n. The couple recently decided not to move and remain in New York where they regularly work, listing agent Eric Moreland of Moreland Properties told the Wall Street Journal.\nThe original asking price was $26.5 million but recently got cut\u00a0 to $23.5 million. The final purchase has not been publicly disclosed.\nIf the $23.5 million ask held it will be among the priciest residential deals in the city limits sold recently, according to Realtor.com data. The next closest price in Austin currently on the market is $19.5 million.\nThe Tarrytown listing sits on 1.24 acres along a live oak-shaded street, and the redesign features work by architecture firm Cuppett Kilpatrick. In addition to the main five-bedroom house and two-bedroom guest house, there are several living spaces with various uses, such as an outdoor kitchen, office, dining room, solarium, large kitchen, breakfast bar and more, according to Moreland\u2019s listing.\n\nLeaded glass windows, marble fireplace, brick and herringbone oak floors and arched doorways are just some of the home\u2019s features. There is also a paneled library, playroom and a screening room with a bar.\nRenovations were still under construction when the home was originally listed, but work was reportedly due to be finished by the end of summer. County records log over $11 million in improvements in the years since the couple purchased the home, including $3.5 million this year alone. The home\u2019s taxable value was most recently appraised at $7.3 million.\nThe New York City apartment that serves as Stone and McCary\u2019s primary residence is understood to be worth about $12 million, according to Realtor.com.\nStone has a track record of profitable real estate flips. In 2022, she sold her Malibu blufftop home for $4.425 million after buying it for $3.25 million in 2018. In 2023, she sold another Los Angeles property for $4.3 million \u2014 nearly double what she paid in 2019.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Distress is growing in New York\u2019s rent-stablized housing stock.\nOne school of thought says that distress is the result of bad actors \u2014 speculative buyers, aggressive lenders \u2014 and elevated interest rates.\nBut some data has begun to run counter to that narrative. It\u2019s not just risk-seeking buyers that are getting hit, according to a recent report from nonprofit lender Community Preservation Corp.\nEven affordable housing projects that borrowed money at fixed interest rates are seeing signs of distress. Many of those are owned by not-for-profit landlords who have regulatory agreements with the city. In CPC\u2019s portfolio, which is 100 percent rent-stabilized, foreclosures, delinquencies and financial trouble have all grown in recent years.\nThe number of foreclosures has increased eightfold since 2022, while the delinquency rate has more than doubled. Nearly 30 percent of buildings don\u2019t make enough in operating income to fully service their debt.\nThe numbers hint that distress in the rent-stabilized housing stock, brought on by high interest rates, rising expenses and tenant-friendly statewide laws, will not be contained. With a rent freeze as a central promise of Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani\u2019s campaign for mayor, players like CPC are concerned that the most affordable units with the lowest-income tenants will feel the squeeze first.\n\u201cYou think, \u2018Well, if we put stuff in the hands of not-for-profits with long-term fixed-rate debt, everything will be okay,\u2019\u201d said Robert Riggs, senior vice president and New York regional director at CPC. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nCPC\u2019s portfolio avoids many of the issues that trap other rent-stabilized buildings into a distress loop. The buildings carry fixed-rate debt, so they\u2019re not affected by rising interest rates, and very little of it \u2014 about $60,000 per unit.\nBut those homes are more susceptible to rising expenses because they have less room to grow their rents. A 2 percent increase on $1,000 doesn\u2019t go as far as the same increase on $2,000.\nThe foreclosures and delinquencies for CPC\u2019s portfolio are still fairly low compared to what\u2019s happening elsewhere in the industry. But they are trending in the wrong direction. Foreclosures have increased from 2 in 2023 to 16 at the end of last year, while delinquencies have risen from about 3 percent to 8 percent in that same time.\nCPC also surveys its borrowers about their finances. Of respondents, 28 percent did not have the operating income to fully cover their debt.\nFor the five years ending last December, expenses per unit increased by 22 percent. Some of that was driven by property insurance costs, which increased 52 percent in that time.\n\u201cThe most pain, in terms of the building and the viability of the asset, is going to be inflicted upon the most affordable buildings,\u201d Riggs said.\n",

        "content": "New York developers are moving fast to embrace an unlikely source for badly needed housing: hotels that until recently housed migrants.\nMore than a dozen former shelters are being eyed for residential conversions, potentially delivering thousands of apartments, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. At least 1,100 units are already in the works, including the 318-unit Baisley Pond Park Residences in Queens, converted from a Hilton near JFK, and a 535-unit affordable housing project at the Stewart Hotel in Midtown.\nStudent housing, market-rate rentals and affordable units are all on the table as developers seize on what they say is a rare, time-sensitive opening.\nThe pipeline is driven partly by the city\u2019s winding down of its hotel shelter program. At its peak in early 2024, the city was housing more than 54,000 migrants in 160 hotels, spending $8 billion since 2022 to meet its right-to-shelter obligations. With arrivals slowing and all but four emergency shelters closed, only the 1,331-room Row NYC is still in use among the hotels.\nMany of the shuttered hotels aren\u2019t likely to reopen for lodging; Vijay Dandapani, president of the Hotel Association of New York City, estimated 40 percent at most would come back, citing pandemic-era wear and tear, costly renovations and the stigma of shelter use.\nConverting hotels to apartments is generally faster and cheaper than ground-up construction, thanks to existing bathrooms and natural light in each room. Still, zoning and building code hurdles loom large, and the city\u2019s past efforts under the 2021 Housing Our Neighbors With Dignity Act have struggled to gain traction.\n\nDevelopers say the economics can work if the building layout cooperates \u2014 combining three hotel rooms into one apartment is common \u2014 and if purchase prices stay well below the cost of reopening.\nBeyond adding units in a city with a record-low 1.4 percent vacancy rate, the conversions could pump new life into lagging commercial districts. Advocates say the projects could also embed social services into the housing.\nWhether the momentum sticks may hinge on political will. Housing shortages are dominating the mayoral race and developers are betting the city will keep looking at conversions as a quick, if partial, fix.\nThe mood in the sector is summed up by Slate Property Group\u2019s David Schwartz: \u201cThe opportunity is right now.\u201d\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The Aloft San Jose Cupertino hotel in western San Jose could become a senior residential care facility, according to documents filed with city planners.\nLocated at 4241 Moorpark Avenue, the property is managed by Shashi Group, the same company that filed the proposal, according to\nSiliconValley.com\n. The filing outlines plans for an 80-unit complex offering assisted living and memory care. The property is owned by the Perusina Family Trust, founded by the late Danford Perusina.\nThe conversion would involve only limited exterior changes and interior renovations to accommodate the new use. No specific timeline was disclosed.\nIndustry experts say the move reflects broader shifts in the Bay Area\u2019s lodging sector rather than issues with the Aloft brand, according to the Mercury News.\nAlan Reay, principal executive with consultancy Atlas Hospitality Group, noted that many hotel owners are reevaluating their assets as the Bay Area hotel market faces increasing challenges. In some cases, he said, converting properties to specialized uses like senior care could yield higher returns than continuing as a hotel.\n\n\u201cThis conversion plan is more of a reflection of the current hotel market rather than problems with the [Aloft] brand,\u201d Reay said.\nOther notable hotels in the regional market have completed conversions, including the southern tower of the two-building Signia by Hilton in San Jose. That 264-room building was acquired by Throckmorton Partners and transformed into a 700-bed student housing complex for San Jose State University, which opened in August 2024.\nIf approved, the Aloft conversion would add to a growing list of adaptive reuse projects, signaling a shift in how owners are reimagining hospitality assets amid evolving market conditions.\nShashi Group manages several other Silicon Valley properties, including the Shashi Hotel in Mountain View, the Aloft Sunnyvale and The Nest Palo Alto.\n\u2014Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "A lender has taken control of a four-story building at 244 Jackson Street in San Francisco following a foreclosure auction on July 31.\nThe lender named JPMBB 2014-C22 Jackson Street LLC, listed in state records with an address at Starwood Capital Group\u2019s Miami office, now owns the 29,700-square-foot property, built in 1913, which currently stands vacant but previously housed office and retail tenants, the\nSan Francisco Business Times reported\n.\nThe building\u2019s prior owner, Roth Jackson LLC \u2014 controlled by father-and-son\npartnership Moris and David Herscowitz \u2014 acquired the property in 2018 for $33 million, or about $1,100 per square foot. At the time, it was backed by a $13.6 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan originated by Barclays in 2014. That loan went into default after maturing in June 2024.\nFollowing an attempted sale that fell through earlier this year, the lender stepped in at auction with a credit bid of just under $10 million, substantially below the outstanding debt and associated costs, which totaled more than $16 million.\n\nThe lender\u2019s acquisition does not necessarily reflect the property\u2019s market value, as credit bids benefit from existing debt compared to an actual purchase offer. The building\u2019s most recent appraisal in August 2024 valued it at $13.3 million, according to the Business Times.\nSince the default, Colliers has served as the court-appointed receiver, effectively managing the property on behalf of the lender. It is expected that the building will soon list for sale.\nThe Jackson Square market, known for its luxury retail stores, has seen a resurgence lately with interest from both investors and tenants. The neighborhood, located near the iconic Transamerica Pyramid, has recently attracted the artificial intelligence giant OpenAI (which acquired former Apple designer Jony Ive\u2019s\nstartup\n), furniture company Branch and luxury brands such as Ralph Lauren and Paul Smith, along with Michelin-starred chef Peter Hemsley. The building at 244 Jackson is located between Jackson Square and the city\u2019s Financial District, according to the Business Times.\n\u2014Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "A health care construction boom has hit the Bay Area, caused by California\u2019s looming 2030 seismic safety deadline and a changing care delivery model that favors smaller, more specialized facilities alongside major hospital upgrades.\nData from the California Department of Health Care Access and Information shows total construction costs for health care projects in the nine-county region reached $2.67 billion in October 2024, the\nSan Francisco Business Times reported\n. That figure is short of the $4.2 billion peak in 2017, but it\u2019s the highest since the pandemic.\nSutter Health\u2019s $422 million, five-story neuroscience complex at 3555 Cesar Chavez Street sits inside its Mission Bernal campus and looms as one of the region\u2019s largest active projects. Breaking ground in June and slated to open in 2028, the facility will consolidate key neurology services, including the Ray Dolby Brain Health Center and Forbes Norris MDA/ALS Research and Treatment Center, and serve as a regional neurosurgery and stroke hub.\nOther major undertakings include Sutter\u2019s planned $1 billion, 1.3-million-square-foot Emeryville hospital; UCSF Health\u2019s $3.8 billion, 900,000-square-foot Helen Diller Hospital at Parnassus; Kaiser Permanente\u2019s 303-bed San Jose Medical Center; and UCSF Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital Oakland\u2019s $300 million seismic rebuild.\n\nAlongside these megaprojects are smaller sites. Sutter\u2019s 11,000-square-foot Livermore care center, opened in June and designed by HED with construction by Skanska USA, offers pediatric and adult exam corridors, imaging and lab services. It\u2019s part of a rollout of 14 similar centers over two years, leveraging standardized designs to speed delivery and reduce costs.\nInterior patient-focused upgrades are also evident at Stanford Medicine Children\u2019s Health\u2019s Bass Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Diseases. Its newly opened outpatient clinic and infusion center now has 14 exam rooms and 15 private infusion bays, accommodating 25,000 annual visits, including 7,000 infusions for children with cancer and other blood disorders.\nWhether large or small, those projects are racing against the seismic compliance clock while aiming to improve patient access and outcomes. As Christina Oh, Sutter\u2019s Greater San Francisco president, put it: Success hinges on \u201cseeing more patients faster\u201d while maintaining clinical excellence and cutting-edge research.\n\u2014Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "The plan to turn the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center into a revitalized mixed-use campus took a big hit last week.\nEmpire State Development and local officials in Queens announced a deal last week to cut the number of housing units proposed for the long-vacant site, the Queens Daily Eagle\nreported\n. Negotiations between the two sides stemmed from opposition about the density of the state\u2019s project.\nOriginally slated for\nmore than 2,800 homes\n, the compromise cuts roughly 850 units from the proposal. A majority of the units in the development were earmarked for ownership, while hundreds were rentals. The reduction leaves slightly more than 2,000 units in the plan.\nFive of the planned eight-story buildings were also axed from the proposal. The agreement will lead to a 27 percent decrease in overall unit square footage and a 15 percent reduction in units allocated for individuals with mental illnesses.\n\u201cWe believe these adjustments demonstrate our commitment to create a project that responds to comments expressed by yourselves and community members and that provides housing which will enable young adults to stay in their neighborhoods with their family support system, allow seniors to age in place, and create new homeownership opportunities,\u201d said ESD chief executive officer Hope Knight.\n\nIt\u2019s not immediately clear how other parts of the original proposal \u2014 retail space, an early childhood center, an older-adult facility and a school \u2014 will be affected by the downsized scale of the project.\nGov. Kathy Hocul initially unveiled plans for the redevelopment at the end of 2023, a sprawling 58-acre project to replace vacant land, buildings and parking lots.\nCreedmoor dates back to 1912, when it opened as a satellite facility of Brooklyn State Hospital. It started as a psychiatric \u201cfarm colony\u201d where patients took part in daily work as part of a therapy regimen.\nThe full campus spans 125 acres. Most of its buildings \u2014 19 out of 25 \u2014 are vacant. Various state-led agencies are expected to continue providing services to patients on the remaining 67 acres at Creedmoor.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The condos snagged contracts at an average asking price of\u00a0 $5,600 per square foot. Amenities in the 11-story building include a doorman, port-cochere, lap pool and parking garage.\n\nThe second most expensive home to land a signed contract was an Upper East Side townhouse, with an asking price just under $45 million. The home at 10 East 67th Street, built in 1881, once belonged to financier and art collector Jules Bache in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nThe seven-story mansion last traded in 2006 for $29 million when investment banker Gerhard Andlinger and his wife Jeanne sold it to a buyer whose identity is shielded by an anonymous LLC. The 13,000-square-foot property was renovated 15 years ago.\nIt has seven bedrooms and 13 bathrooms and has an elevator, rooftop glass atrium and seven fireplaces.\nSerhant\u2019s Ryan Serhant and Melissa Post had the listing.\nOf the 22 properties, 16 were condos, two were co-ops and four were townhouses.\nThe homes\u2019 combined asking price was $283 million, for an average price of $12.9 million and a median of $5.9 million. The typical home spent more than 640 days on the market and was discounted 5 percent from the original listing price.\n",

        "content": "DTLA Law Group is growing its headquarters in a larger new space in downtown Los Angeles.\nThe law firm is moving from 612 South Broadway to 540 South Santa Fe Avenue in the Arts District,\nL.A. Business First\nreported. The Santa Fe Avenue offices were the former headquarters of Lucky Brand, known for its jeans and other clothing and accessories. DTLA Law Group\u2019s new home is set to open Sept. 1.\nThe new offices will more than double its current footprint from 25,000 square feet to a renovated 52,000-square-foot space. Employees will be able to enjoy open workspaces and private rooms in the new offices and take advantage of building amenities like a cafe, lounges and conference rooms.\nAs part of the expansion, DTLA Law Group plans to add new attorneys and expand its litigation footprint, according to the company, which is making the move in the wake of ICE raids that roiled through the immigrant-rich city.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about expanding our mission and making sure that working people, immigrants, families and everyday Angelenos have access to the same level of legal firepower as the most powerful institutions in this city,\u201d Farid Yaghoubtil, founder of DTLA Law Group, said in a\nstatement\n.\n\nLaw firms are among the so-called traditional companies that have grown their foothold in the Greater Los Angeles office market in recent years. Between 2021 and 2023, tech and entertainment companies were ahead of the pack in grabbing office space, but since then, law firms have been some of the biggest players in office absorption, according to\nAvison Young\n.\nLast month, Atlanta-based labor and employment law firm\nFisher Phillips\nsigned a new lease for 35,744 square feet at 515 South Flower Street in Downtown Los Angeles as well as a new 13,624-square-foot lease at 21600 Oxnard Street in Woodland Hills. Fisher Phillips will join fellow law firm Paul Hastings when it opens its new offices at the 52-story City National Plaza tower in downtown Los Angeles.\nLast week, law firm\nBehar Gibbs Savage Paulson\nrenewed its 35,754-square-foot lease on two floors at One World Trade Center in Long Beach. Asking rent in the building ranges from $2.95 to $3.15 per square foot per month.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Concord Summit Capital\u2019s Robert Horton and George Smith Partners\u2019 Justin Piasecki arranged the financing.\nThe development, located in the southern end of the largely residential Echo Park District adjacent to Downtown L.A., totals about 86,500 square feet and includes studios, one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments. The apartments are deed-restricted at 80 percent, meaning households can only earn up to 80 percent of the median income; in Los Angeles County that would be $84,500 for a single person, $96,950 for two, $109,050 for three and so on,\naccording to\nthe Department of Regional Planning\u2019s income limits.\n\nThe 189-apartment development at 1540 West Court Street benefits from Mayor Karen Bass\u2019 Executive Directive 1 (ED1), which aims to streamline the approval process for affordable housing.\nThe basketball players turned developers have two other Echo Park\nprojects\n: one at 1230 West Sunset Boulevard and the other at 333 Douglas Street. The latter is set to be 33 apartments, spanning about 22,000 square feet \u2014 and the former, 87 apartments and around 42,000 square feet but is not yet under construction. Visionary Developments has a mixed-use project in Silver Lake that is under planning review, too.\nLos Angeles\u2019 multifamily market ended the first quarter of the year with a 95.4 percent occupancy rate,\naccording to\na CBRE report; the average rent per apartment was $2,822.\n",

        "content": "An office building attached to San Francisco\u2019s famed Golden Gate Theatre is on the market.\nThe property at 25 Taylor Street, once home to a WeWork location, is for sale after going into receivership last year, the\nSan Francisco Business Times\nreported. WeWork\u2019s lease once spanned 42,565 square feet of the 50,000-square-foot building, where it remained for nearly a decade.\nThe\nColliers\nlisting doesn\u2019t share a price or owner for the property. The building was valued at $28.1 million in 2014, but a 2023 appraisal placed its value at $9.5 million, according to data from commercial real estate data platform Trepp cited by\nMarketWatch\n.\nWeWork closed its location there in 2021, leaving Baltimore-based landlord War Horse Cities with a nearly totally vacant building in the aftermath of the pandemic. Soon thereafter, in May 2021, War Horse Cities sued WeWork for more than $11 million for breach of lease and breach of guaranty. The lawsuit was dismissed in March 2023, according to the\nBusiness Times\n.\nAn $18.5 million loan tied to the office building went into default in 2021. Private equity investor and JSP Ventures founder Scott Plank secured the funding at the time. The loan was transferred into special servicing in February 2023 with an outstanding balance of $16.9 million. An unnamed receiver was appointed at the end of 2023, according to the Business Times.\n\nThe attached Golden Gate Theatre is owned by ATG Entertainment and is not for sale. The property was built in 1922, with WeWork making extensive upgrades to the site after moving in in 2013. The offices are eligible for federal and state historic rehabilitation tax credits, which offers a combined benefit of up to 40 percent on qualified rehabilitation expenses.\nWeWork\nfiled for bankruptcy in November 2023. The 25 Taylor property was one of seven leases in San Francisco it planned to abandon as part of its bankruptcy proceedings. The others include 430 California Street, 1455 Market Street, 222 Kearny Street, 180 Geary Street and 800 Market Street. All of those locations are no longer operational.\nThe Mid-Market area has struggled post-pandemic as several notable office tenants like X, Spotify, Uber and Reddit fled for other spaces amid low foot traffic and deteriorating neighborhood conditions, according to the Business Times.\nSouth of the city in Silicon Valley, Amazon has partnered with WeWork to house its employees in offices subleased out by the co-working company,\nfilling offices in Santa Clara\nand Mountain View.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The president\u2019s quest for retribution against his foes continues to rage on.\nThe Justice Department subpoenaed New York Attorney General Letitia James in connection with her landmark civil fraud lawsuit against Donald Trump \u2014 a case that hit the former president and his company with $360 million in penalties \u2014 while separately investigating James\u2019 own real estate transactions, the New York Times\nreported\n.\nThe two subpoenas, issued by the acting U.S. attorney in Albany, mark an escalation in Trump\u2019s campaign to target one of his chief adversaries. One demands records tied to the Trump Organization case, in which James convinced a judge that Trump inflated property values by billions to secure favorable financing. The verdict and penalty have been appealed.\nJames\u2019 lawyer called the investigation \u201cthe most blatant and desperate example of this administration carrying out the president\u2019s political retribution campaign.\u201d The White House declined to comment on whether or not it is directing the probes against James.\nThe other covers her 2020 suit against the NRA, which ousted then-CEO Wayne LaPierre and curtailed the group\u2019s political influence.\n\nAlongside the subpoenas, Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed Ed Martin \u2014 a Trump ally and former interim U.S. attorney \u2014 as special prosecutor to lead the separate real estate probe. That investigation is examining whether James falsified records for homes she owns in Brooklyn and Virginia, worth under $2 million combined, to obtain better loan terms.\nThe\nallegations\nclosely mirror, albeit on a far smaller scale, the valuation misrepresentation claims she leveled at Trump. FBI director Kash Patel confirmed the existence of the property inquiry earlier this year.\nMartin is also investigating Sen. Adam Schiff\u2019s property dealings, suggesting a coordinated push to use federal legal tools against Trump\u2019s political opponents. Whether the real estate allegations against James have merit or are purely political, they threaten to pull the state\u2019s top law enforcement official into a drawn-out fight over the very valuation practices she\u2019s spent years policing.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The penthouse at Regalia, a luxury condo tower in Sunny Isles Beach, finally secured a buyer, topping luxury residential sales activity last week across Miami-Dade County.\nBuyers signed nine contracts between Aug. 4 and Aug. 10, according to the latest\nEklund-Gomes\nreport, which tracks listings of homes and condos asking $4 million and up in\nMiami-Dade\nthat are included in the Multiple Listing Service. The properties spent about 111 days on the market, on average.\nThirty-one luxury listings were added to the market, for a total of 1,156 listings.\nThe\nprevious week\n, buyers signed contracts for 12 properties in Miami-Dade, asking a combined $96.2 million.\nThe asking dollar volume for the seven single-family homes and two condos under contract last week totals $109.7 million, according to the report, which is authored by the Douglas Elliman team led by Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes.\nThe single-family homes that entered into contract last week had an average asking price of $10.6 million and spent an average of 126 days on the market. They totaled $73.9 million in asking dollar volume.\n\nAt the top of the pending single-family home sales inked last week is the contract signed for the waterfront home at 100 Golden Beach Drive in\nGolden Beach\n, asking $18.5 million with Alan Eskenazi of Miles Goldstein Real Estate. Property records show Johnny Grobman and Noemi Geller own the 7,755-square-foot, six-bedroom and five-and-a-half-bathroom house. It sits on 0.6 acres overlooking the Intracoastal Waterway. The house was built in 2004 and expanded in 2016.\nGrobman is in federal prison. In 2022, he was sentenced to 220 months, or more than 18 years, for his role in a baby formula fraud scheme. A jury found him and others guilty in 2020 of conspiring to commit wire fraud; wire fraud; money laundering; conspiring to obtain pre-retail medical products worth $5,000 or more by fraud or deception, theft of pre-retail medical products; and smuggling goods from the United States, according to the Department of Justice. He\u2019s on the hook for $142 million in restitution.\nThe condos that secured buyers last week had an average asking price of $17.9 million and spent 60 days on the market, on average. They totaled $35.8 million in asking dollar volume, or an average of $3,308 per square foot.\nPenthouse 43 at\nRegalia\n, at 19575 Collins Avenue in Sunny Isles Beach, led the report. The 10,755-square-foot, six-bedroom and six-and-a-half-bathroom condo is on the market with Danny Hertzberg of the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker for $19.9 million. The two-story penthouse includes a rooftop pool, 500-bottle wine cellar and its own movie theater. The\ndevelopers\nlost the unit when it was sold via auction for $20.5 million in 2022. At one point, it was on the market for $33.9 million.\nLast week in New York, buyers signed contracts for 22 homes, according to the latest\nOlshan\nreport. Their combined asking price was $283.6 million, and the typical home spent 649 days on the market.\n",

CBRE broker Tom Svoboda is marketing the property.\nRental demand and rent growth are rising in Chicago and the suburbs as higher interest rates and construction costs put a damper on development, especially in the popular North Side of Chicago Lakeview area.\n\nOther residential redevelopment proposals are making headway in the area, including\nMavrek Development\u2019s\nfive-story, 46-unit project at 925 West Belmont Avenue that was initially proposed as an 11-story, 210 unit complex before plans were scaled back due to financial complications.\nTwo theater sites on the North Side are slated for residential redevelopment. Local firm Jab Real Estate has plans to convert the former Lakeview home of the Blue Man Group \u2014\nBriar Street Theatre\n, at 749 West Briar Place \u2014 to a mixed-use complex that includes 66 residential units. The same firm is proposing the redevelopment of the former Stage 773 theater, at 1215-1227 West Belmont Avenue to 40 residential units. Those two theater redevelopment projects come as performing arts organizations have continued to struggle to regain audiences since the onset of the pandemic.\nThe slowdown in deliveries has also brought investor interest to Chicago and the midwest. Major sales this year include the 292-unit Cobbler Square building in Old Town, which sold for $87 million, and the 191-unit Elevate Lincoln Park building, which sold for $114 million.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Vlad Doronin\u2019s Aman New York nabbed a resale for a premium.\nUnit 16A at 730 Fifth Avenue traded for $28 million in an off-market deal, up from the $24 million the seller paid for it two years ago, according to the city register. The latest deal for the three-bedroom, three-bathroom unit works out to roughly $6,300 per square foot.\nThe deal marks another profitable flip at the luxury hotel-condo conversion, though it\u2019s a far cry from its priciest sale \u2014 a\n$135 million penthouse\nDoronin bought for himself last summer.\nJust weeks later, the building snagged its\nfirst resale\n, when a 23rd-floor unit closed for $64 million, or more than $10,000 per square foot. Doronin\u2019s OKO Group initially sold the four-bedroom apartment for $51 million, or roughly $8,000 per square foot, earlier that year.\nThe seller of the 16th-floor unit, whose identity is shielded by an anonymous LLC called NYPC Crown, bought it for roughly $3 million less than the asking price listed in the offering plan.\n\nThe buyer\u2019s identity is also hidden by an LLC known as Boldt Castle, named after a castle in upstate Alexandria Bay that was commissioned in the early 20th century by George Boldt, the owner of the famed Waldorf Astoria Hotel. The deed was signed by Marcella Marcal Dos Santos.\nAn attorney for the seller did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe Billionaires\u2019 Row development crossed the sellout finish line in January, when the last of 22 units atop the landmarked Crown Building closed for\n$66 million\n. Sales at the building launched quietly in 2018 with buyers at the building including a Swiss money manager and Hong Kong-based private equity executive Terence Chan.\nDoronin, through a partnership with developer Michael Shvo, purchased the office portion of the building for $475 million in 2015. Shvo was no longer a part of the project by 2017, though he kept a small stake.\n",

        "content": "Mayor Eric Adams is betting big on the Bronx waterfront, unveiling plans for Fordham Landing South \u2014 a 927-unit, 100-percent affordable housing project on an underused stretch of the Harlem River.\nThe development, a partnership between Dynamic Star, Lettire Construction and the city, will bring two mixed-use buildings, public waterfront access, a new road and Metro-North station access to a vacant site south of the University Heights Bridge, the mayor\u2019s office\nannounced\n.\nAt least 15 percent of the units will be reserved for formerly homeless families. Financing will come from the city\u2019s Department of Housing Preservation and Development and a $55 million state award for infrastructure work.\n\u201cThis stretch of the Bronx waterfront has led many lives, but will soon be home to over 900 families,\u201d Adams said in a statement.\nThe announcement comes as the Adams administration touts more than 426,000 homes created, preserved or planned since 2022. The mayor also pushed through the first citywide rezoning in six decades, known as \u201cCity of Yes for Housing Opportunity,\u201d which City Hall said will yield 80,000 new homes over 15 years alongside $5 billion in infrastructure upgrades.\nFordham Landing South is part of a larger neighborhood-building push that includes rezonings around Bronx Metro-North stations, Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn and areas in Midtown South, Jamaica and Long Island City. The administration is also advancing its \u201cCity of Yes for Families\u201d strategy to promote housing near schools, transit, parks and grocery stores, as well as boosting homeownership tools and tenant protections.\n\nDynamic Star co-founder and CEO Gary Segal called the Bronx project \u201cthe long-held dream of transforming this neglected stretch of Bronx waterfront into a vibrant, accessible community\u2026 What was once deserted will soon be a destination \u2014 a place where families can live, work and thrive for generations to come.\u201d\nThe timeline for the project is unclear; at one point, the goal appeared to be to break ground in the first quarter and deliver by 2027.\nThere are also questions about a\nseparate phase\nof the larger Fordham Landing project.\u00a0 Fordham Landing North is expected to include more than 1.8 million square feet of residential space, 744,000 square feet of office space and 143,000 square feet of retail space.\nAt the start of the year, however, a joint venture of Blackstone and Rialto Capital filed a pre-foreclosure action against the developers of the site.\nA representative from Dynamic Star did not immediately respond to a request for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\n",

        "content": "Retired racing driver Michael Andretti paid $27.4 million for a waterfront compound in Fort Lauderdale, marking one of the priciest home sales in the city over the past year.\nAndretti is the son of racing legend Mario Andretti.\nMichael Andretti and his wife, Jodi Ann Andretti, acquired the 17,812-square-foot mansion at 2900 Northeast 37th Street from repo king Patrick K. Willis, property records show. Willis owns El Dorado Hills, California-based American Recovery Services, one of the largest auto repossession firms and debt collectors in the country.\nThe nine-bedroom, 15-bathroom home returned to the market last year for $39 million, which means it sold for 30 percent off the asking price. But Willis fared well \u2014 he paid just $12.5 million\nfor the mansion in 2021\n. The house was built in 2005 on a 1.1-acre lot with 665 feet of water frontage.\nIt was listed with Premier Estate Properties\u2019 Karson Dietrich. R.J. Spadaro of Realty 100 Associates represented the seller, according to Redfin.\n\nDietrich said the estate is \u201cone of the most amenity rich properties in all of\nFort Lauderdale\n.\u201d It has three-phase mega-yacht power, which is comparable to a commercial marina, according to Dietrich. The home also includes a resort-style pool, a wellness wing with a gym, spa and solarium, staff quarters and a seven-car garage.\nAndretti won 42 races before he retired in the early- to mid-2000s and owns Andretti Autosport, an IndyCar-winning team. His son, Marco Andretti, is an IndyCar Series driver.\nA few big-ticket deals have closed recently in Fort Lauderdale, which is often overshadowed by competing markets in Palm Beach and Miami Beach. In April, developer Louis Paolino Jr. sold the house at 2626 Delmar Place in Fort Lauderdale to an LLC managed by Paul D. DeAngelo\nfor $27.8 million\n.\nIn September, financier\nDonald Sussman\nsold his waterfront mansion in Fort Lauderdale for $70 million. The sale holds the price record for home sales in the coastal city. Sussman sold the 20,000-square-foot, 10-bedroom, 15-and-a-half bathroom estate at 5 Harborage Isle to a Delaware LLC named after the 2.7-acre property. It has 1,035 feet of water frontage.\n",

While de la Garza held those positions, more than 1,200 agents joined the brokerage.\nHe has sold more than 750 homes, equating to $350 million in career sales volume across Texas and California.\nHomebase wasn\u2019t the only outfit to recruit over the past month in Los Angeles and Orange counties:\n\u27a4 Eric Lavey joined the Beverly Hills Estates bringing with him a diverse business focus.\nThat includes Beverly Hills and the broader Westside, and he also has expertise in the Coachella Valley, including Palm Springs, Rancho Mirage and Palm Desert.\nLavey was previously with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty and had on-market sales volume in excess of $60 million over the past 12 months. He counted about the same amount of volume in off-market transactions during that same period.\n\u27a4 Compass continues to bolster its offices, with the most recent additions padding its Orange County roster.\nThat includes bringing over Diane Kutinsky and Chrissy Reilly from Seven Gables to the brokerage\u2019s Huntington Beach office.\nThe duo notched more than $49 million in sales volume over the past 12 months and come to Compass with more than 25 years of combined experience.\n\nThey specialize in Huntington Beach\u2019s Seacliff, Seacliff on the Greens and Edward Hill Estates communities, though the two have sold homes from Santa Monica to San Clemente.\n\u27a4 Elsewhere in Orange County, Compass brought the Robinett Team to its Dana Point office.\nDoug, Soosan and Serena Robinett joined Compass after a 25-year run with First Team. The Robinetts have sold $15.6 million in sales volume year to date and focus their business on south OC\u2019s residential market.\n\u27a4 Andy Hairabedien is now with Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California, bringing to the brokerage his specialty in the San Gabriel and San Fernando valleys.\nHairabedien, who comes from a family of developers and previously ran his own brokerage, counts his wife Lillian as part of his team, along with Sophia Kelley and Nareg Khatchadourian.\n\u27a4 In Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\u2019s Beverly Hills office, the brokerage added Mary Hollis.\nHollis works in luxury residential real estate, in addition to new construction. She focuses on Beverly Hills and the greater Los Angeles area.\n\u27a4 Nourmand &amp; Associates nabbed Realtor Nita Bakhda to focus on the Beverly Hills market. Before entering real estate, Bakhda was involved in residential leasing.\nThe brokerage also added agent Sami Housman, who specializes in Hancock Park, Brookside, West Hollywood, Windsor Square, Hollywood Hills, Los Feliz and Mid City.\nHousman, who was previously with Carolwood Estates, has a background in the entertainment industry, where she was a manager and producer.\n",

That could prompt the need for a federal waiver for him to serve on the housing authority or prompt a requirement that he wait one year after leaving office \u2014 known as the \u201crevolving door provision\u201d from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nSenior mayoral adviser Jason Lee said Johnson is determined to appoint Burnett to CEO of the agency.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the regulation applies in this instance. Former Alderman Terry Peterson also moved from city council straight to CHA under former Mayor Richard Daley. It is unclear if and when a federal waiver would be granted.\n\nThe agency has gone more than nine months without a permanent CEO, and the board has dealt with several other top executives leaving the authority in recent months.\nIf Burnett lands the $310,000-a-year job, he has pledged to create replacement housing and jobs, promises he has made to residents of Cabrini-Green, the demolished CHA complex where Burnett grew up.\nHe said as CEO he would prioritize a review of CHA employees and contractors, find a \u201cgood chief of staff,\u201d fill the job of\nchief legal counsel\nand move forward with CHA\u2019s 30-year-old Plan for Transformation.\nCHA has faced significant management problems, including high turnover among executives, with over\n$868,000 in severance payouts\nto departing leaders amid ongoing leadership instability. The agency has struggled with outdated technology leading to\n$10 million in uncollected rent\n. Meanwhile, the agency is embroiled in legal disputes, including a\n$24 million verdict\nrelated to lead poisoning, which has compounded its operational challenges.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Federal Realty Investment Trust is looking to sell another apartment complex in its Santana Row residential and commercial district.\nThe Rockville, Maryland-based firm is preparing to list the 212-unit Misora luxury apartment complex in San Jose for sale, the\nSilicon Valley Business Journal\nreported. In May, Hines bought another apartment complex in Santana Row, the 108-unit\nLevare\n, for $73.9 million.\nFederal Realty CEO Don Wood shared on the company\u2019s Aug. 6 earnings call that the firm plans to sell the Misora apartments across the street from the Levare.\nHe noted that assets such as the Misora and Levare are essential in broader shopping centers and mixed-use communities such as Santana Row without integrating them into the core retail amenity base.\n\u201cThese are all high-quality assets that we\u2019ve built over the last 25 years that are ripe for monetization without disrupting the productivity or the valuation of the core mixed-use environments we\u2019ve created,\u201d Wood said, per the Business Journal.\n\nMisora was built in 2014 and totals roughly 222,000 square feet, according to Yardi Matrix data cited by the Business Journal. The property boasts\namenities\nlike a lap pool, lounging pool, spa, fireplace lounge, rooftop deck and outdoor barbecue and dining facilities. If Misora sells for a similar price-per-unit as Levare, the overall price tag would be more than $145 million.\nHousing continues to be a priority at Santana Row for Federal Realty. Last month, the owner and developer announced\nplans for a 258-unit apartment complex\nat 358 Hatton Street, currently a surface parking lot for shops, restaurants, offices and homes in Santana Row. It would be the first new housing development at Santana Row in a decade.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on this residential project for a very long time,\u201d Patrick McMahon, Federal Realty\u2019s senior vice president of development, told\nThe Mercury News\n, noting that groundbreaking on the project is imminent. Construction is expected to take about 26 months with units ready for move-in in 2027.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Sterling Bay\u2019s plans for a 450,000-square foot office building in Deep Ellum are over after the troubled developer sold the property.\nThe Chicago-based firm sold the 2.7-acre site, at 301 North Crowdus Street, to an entity called Dos Hombres Ventures, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nDavidson Bogel Real Estate\u2019s Jake Milner, Bennett Sikes and Scott Lake brokered the sale and said the unidentified buyers have \u201ccreative redevelopment plans\u201d but declined to provide details. The ownership entity has an address in the Lubbock suburb Wolfforth.\nSterling Bay planned to build a 13-story office building called The Assembly, a $100 million endeavor designed by Dallas\u2019 HKS. It was originally slated to open by the end of 2024, but construction never started. A vacant office building that was once home to animation studio Reel FX still sits at the location.\nA website for The Assembly shows office space, ground floor retail and amenities including \u201cwellness\u201d initiatives.\n\nThe sale is the latest offloading of real estate by Sterling Bay, which is facing significant challenges following delays on its planned Lincoln Yards megadevelopment in Chicago.\nThe firm listed a 1.56-acre parcel that\u2019s entitled for a 355-unit residential project at 2033 North Kingsbury Street last month, and it has sold several other properties in Chicago. In March, it handed over control of a significant portion of the 53-acres that were slated for Lincoln Yards to lender\nBank OZK via deed-in-lieu of foreclosure\n. The deal, which gave Bank OZK 28 acres, settled Sterling Bay\u2019s $126 million mortgage. The loan\u2019s maturity had been extended several times, and the lender had written it down to $88 million by the end of last year.\nSterling Bay also recently sold a 47-story apartment tower in Chicago\u2019s Loop to\nCedar Street\n. And it listed a fully leased, 390,000-square-foot office tower at\n311 West Monroe Street\nin Chicago ahead of its debt maturity.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Like any good socialist, Zohran Mamdani is familiar with the Marxist phrase, \u201cFrom each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.\u201d\nMamdani says he was making\n$47,000 a year\nwhen he moved into his rent-stabilized apartment, which he found on StreetEasy. Maybe he needed a low-rent unit then. But now he makes\n$142,000\n, his wife also works, and his parents are wealthy.\nClearly, Mamdani is getting more than he needs. Karl Marx would not approve.\nNow\nalong comes Andrew Cuomo\n, calling on his rival mayoral candidate to give up the $2,300-a-month one-bedroom in Astoria.\nCuomo also pitched \u201c\nmeans testing\n\u201d to screen out high-earning tenants from rent-stabilized housing: To initially lease a unit, a tenant\u2019s monthly income could not be more than 3.33 times the monthly rent. That is, the rent would have to be at least 30 percent of the tenant\u2019s income.\nThat might sound appealing to critics of rent regulation and even to progressives. Why should more than 1 in 5 rent-stabilized units go to households making six figures?\nHowever, allowing only low-income people to lease these apartments is a bad idea, although not for the reasons that most people think.\nRent stabilization is a fundamentally flawed housing system. It is literally designed to\nperpetuate the housing emergency\n.\nTo give it a veneer of legitimacy by means testing is like painting over mold. It might look better initially, but doesn\u2019t fix the problem. Indeed, mold only gets worse under new paint.\n\u201cThe problem with rent control is that it addresses a problem rooted in regulations with more regulations,\u201d wrote\nMichael Hendrix\nof the Manhattan Institute. \u201cRent regulations \u2018solve\u2019 America\u2019s affordability crisis for a few people, for a short time, at great cost to everyone else.\u201d\nThe fact that many well-off New Yorkers enjoy artificially low rents \u2014 some while keeping beach houses or country homes \u2014 is a potent argument to junk the whole system.\nBut there are better reasons to end it altogether. Rent regulation merely creates winners and losers, reducing vacancy at 1 million apartments to nearly zero. It promotes the deterioration of housing, makes tenants enemies rather than customers of landlords, hinders new construction and stands in the way of a fair and functional housing market.\n\nIf that sounds too philosophical, consider the practical arguments against means testing.\nOwners of rent-stabilized housing are under the government\u2019s thumb in so many ways. Means-testing deprives them of the right to rent to a tenant of their choice, and adds yet another layer of bureaucracy. The last thing owners need is another hoop to jump through.\nAlso, it\u2019s usually easier to operate a mixed-income building than one where everyone is barely getting by.\nNew York actually had a crude form of means testing until June 15, 2019: A landlord could evict tenants from rent-stabilized units by proving that they made more than $225,000 two years in a row.\nThat was difficult and it rarely happened. Then the 2019 rent reform removed the incentives to vacate a unit. So even if means testing were restored, most landlords would gain nothing by enforcing an income limit.\nAn asset limit would be even harder to police, as assets are private and easily hidden.\nIn theory, the state could monitor tenants\u2019 income by looking at their tax returns. If the Division of Homes and Community Renewal provided the tax department with a complete list of rent-stabilized units, the tax office could flag tenants who exceeded an income threshold.\nBut then what? Who would evict these tenants? Landlords are not going to endure a two-year slog through housing court and pay thousands in legal fees to replace rich tenants with poor ones who pay exactly the same rent.\nTraditional affordable housing programs only screen incomes before the initial lease-signing. They don\u2019t kick out tenants who get a raise or a better job. That would be highly disruptive, and a disincentive for people to advance their careers.\nIf Mamdani left his apartment, it would not guarantee his landlord would rent it to a needier tenant. And forcing unsubsidized landlords to do that is unworkable and possibly unconstitutional.\nI don\u2019t blame Cuomo for raising this subject, even though he was dishonest to say that Mamdani\u2019s rental forces a mother and her children to live in a shelter. He is trying to win an election, and his attack has brought attention to a dysfunctional system. Besides, all is fair in love and politics.\nBut means testing would be a bureaucratic nightmare, and would give a patina of acceptability to an unacceptable system. Perhaps that\u2019s why Cuomo never proposed it during his 11 years as governor.\n",

        "content": "Andrew Cuomo thinks rent-stabilized apartments should be reserved for tenants who spend at least a third of their income on rent.\nOn Monday, Cuomo released details on \u201cZohran\u2019s Law,\u201d a proposal inspired by the fact that Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani lives in a rent-stabilized apartment.\nHere\u2019s the gist: Once a rent stabilized apartment becomes vacant, a landlord could only rent to someone who would spend at least 30 percent of their income on rent.\nMamdani pays $2,300 a month, and makes $142,000 as a state Assembly member (meaning he spends well below that 30 percent threshold). In a press release, Cuomo said the law is needed to ensure stabilized apartments are going to New Yorkers in need and to \u201cstop the Zohran Mamdanis of the world from gaming the system and boxing out lower income New Yorkers.\u201d Cuomo\u2019s law wouldn\u2019t kick Mamdani out of his apartment, though. He\u2019d have to leave of his own accord before those rules would kick in.\nBefore I get into the particulars of the proposal, it is important to note that the mayor does not have the authority to make this kind of change, and a law limiting access to rent-stabilized apartments would be a hard sell to state lawmakers.\nCuomo framed the proposal as a complement to the elimination of high-income decontrol in 2019. That was another form of rooting out tenants from stabilized housing if they made too much.\nPrior to June 2019, one of the ways that stabilized units could be deregulated was if the rent exceeded a certain threshold and the existing tenant\u2019s gross income was $200,000 or more for two consecutive years. Cuomo\u2019s proposal \u201cbuilds on the important 2019 reform\u2026 by keeping these units in the system while making sure they are reserved for households that actually need affordable housing.\u201d\nI asked his spokesperson why this latest form of means testing wasn\u2019t paired with that change in 2019, when Cuomo was governor and had more sway over state law, but I didn\u2019t hear back.\nHigh-income decontrol was used less frequently by landlords than the other avenues.\nA 2020 Rent Guidelines Board report\nfound that 160 stabilized units had been deregulated in 2019 (before the rent law passed) through high-income decontrol. Nearly 8,000 were deregulated through another practice eliminated in 2019, high-rent vacancy decontrol, during that same period.\nAs with high-income decontrol, Cuomo\u2019s new version of means testing would be enforced by the state\u2019s already overextended housing regulator. There\u2019s also a question of whether adding these new rules will further slow down how quickly tenants can move in (the city recently\nmade changes\nto its housing lottery to cut back on the bureaucratic hurdles delaying tenant access to affordable apartments).\nIf the goal of \u201cZohran\u2019s Law\u201d is to reshape the rent-stabilization system into an affordable housing program where housing is set aside for New Yorkers earning a certain amount, it is treading in the opposite direction of the city\u2019s other housing programs.\nUnder the city\u2019s Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program, for instance, rents are considered \u201caffordable\u201d because they are generally set so that tenants do not pay more than 30 percent of their income on rent. That\u2019s not always the case, and there is, of course, a whole debate around what is truly affordable housing, but that is a guiding principle for what is considered affordable.\n\nSomeone who pays more than 30 percent of their income on rent is considered rent-burdened, and requiring tenants to either be on the verge of that or beyond it in order to access stabilized housing arguably diminishes whatever \u201cstabilizing\u201d quality the housing provides.\nTenants\u2019 groups unsurprisingly criticized Cuomo\u2019s proposal. TenantBloc\u2019s Cea Weaver called means testing rent stabilization \u201ca backdoor plan to gut it, ensuring that the people who keep our city running \u2013 teachers, grocery clerks, delivery workers, nurses \u2013 get pushed out.\u201d Landlord groups also weren\u2019t too hot on the idea either. Leaders of the New York Apartment Association posted on social media that the proposal doesn\u2019t address what they see as the main issue: That rents are kept well below the costs of operating these properties.\n\u201cNY city and state government has used rent stabilized housing as its affordable housing program for decades,\u201d NYAA\u2019s Jay Martin posted on X. \u201cIt\u2019s sucked it dry pretending to care about the quality of the housing for renters by attacking the owners for not conjuring revenue out of thin air.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: What actions, within the mayor\u2019s actual power, would you like to see the next mayor take in connection with rent-stabilized housing? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The building that houses the Morrin Centre, an English-language library in Quebec City, was constructed in the early 1800s as one of the city\u2019s first prisons,\naccording to the centre\u2019s website\n.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 NYCHA will provide rental assistance to the nearly 5,500 low-income households who are set to lose aid after the federal government decided not to renew the Emergency Housing Voucher program, which is set to run out of funds five years ahead of schedule, according to\nGothamist\n. In order to fund this assistance, the housing agency will stop issuing new Section 8 vouchers to the thousands on the waiting list.\n\u2014 The Adams administration will close New York City\u2019s last hotel dedicated to housing homeless migrants, the Row NYC,\nGothamist\nreports. The hotel complex was the first of many to be converted during 2022\u2019s surge of asylum seekers. It joins the list of 64 other migrant shelters that have been shut down since last June.\n\u2014\u00a0Zohran Mamdani launched a \u201cFive Boroughs Against Trump\u201d tour on Monday, framing himself as the strongest opponent to the president while attacking rival Andrew Cuomo over alleged ties to Trump,\namNY\nreports. Touting endorsements by Ruth Messinger, Keith Powers and Harvey Epstein, it\u2019s the latest development in Mamdani\u2019s attempt to center the race around opposition to Trump and his agenda. \u2014\nQuinn Waller\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was for a condominium unit for\n$28 million\nat 730 Fifth Avenue. The Midtown condo is 4,500 square feet and last sold in 2023 as a new-construction unit for $24.3 million.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$54.5 million\nfor a commercial unit at 85 Jay Street. The rental Dumbo units are a part of the 728-unit, 21-story Front &amp; York condo.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was for a penthouse at 255 East 77th Street for $24 million. The Upper East Side condo is 5,500 square feet and listed by\nCompass\u2019\nAlexa Lambert, Alison Black and Shelton Smith.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for a proposed 26,232-square-foot, six-story, mixed-use building at 6420 Bay Parkway in Brooklyn.

The 4-million-square-foot project could eventually include up to 1,900 apartments and condos, 39,000 square feet of retail, office space, a 17-slip marina and 770 parking spaces. Madison Realty Capital provided the developer with a\n$310 million construction loan\nin 2021.\nThe first phase is almost done. Chetrit is nearing completion on the 54-story, 632-unit luxury apartment tower on the site at 275 Southwest Sixth Street. At least two additional towers are planned on the remaining land. In 2022, Chetrit\nrevealed plans\ntapping David Grutman\u2019s Groot Hospitality to handle the food and beverage programming in the first tower.\nFlow will manage the apartment tower and lead development of the rest of the project as managing member of the majority ownership, according to a press release.\nThe final version of the deal is based on a $525 million market capitalization of the project, which is now called Flow on the Miami River, according to the release.\nNeumann, who co-founded WeWork, has been expanding his Flow empire in South Florida and abroad \u2014 including in\nSaudi Arabia\n.\n\nFlow is developing a three-tower apartment, office and retail project in Aventura; an apartment and commercial complex in El Portal; a 466-unit\nFlow-branded condo tower\nat Miami Worldcenter; and the completed Flow Miami and Flow Fort Lauderdale apartment buildings.\nFlow is partnering with Canada Global on more than 9 million square feet of mixed-use projects, including about 5,000 apartments, according to the release. Flow purchased 30 percent of Canada Global, an Israeli real estate investment company led by Assaf Tuchmair and Barak Rosen, for about $27 million, according to\nCalcalist\n.\nThe Chetrit family has had the Miami River project in the works for\nmore than a decade\n. The Miami City Commission\napproved\na major site rezoning and the project\u2019s development agreement in 2015.\nLate last year, Chetrit\npartnered\nwith Montreal-based Lotus International on Chetrit\u2019s long-awaited Miami Beach hotel project, the redevelopment of the Collins Park Hotel at 2000 Park Avenue. Chetrit also secured an $88 million refinancing for the loan backing the property.\nThe Chetrit family\u2019s empire includes the Chetrit Group and the Chetrit Organization, both of which have been tied up in litigation as of late. In New York, Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 administration is alleging the Chetrit Group, led by Meyer and Joseph Chetrit, allowed a Times Square property once dubbed the city\u2019s \u201cdirtiest\u201d hotel to deteriorate after defaulting on a $233 million loan.\n",

Richardson\u2019s construction company, Blazer Building, expects to finish the apartment clubhouse by the end of next year, with the residential buildings coming later.\nRichardson, a yoga studio owner and former athlete, has developed about two dozen properties in Houston; however, this is only the second Define Living concept. The first opened at 1888 Brittmoore last year, and all 260 units were leased in 10 months, Richardson said.\n\nThis development has 4.4 acres more than the first, so it will give the company \u201cthe ability to build a little more expensive with our amenities,\u201d Richardson said.\nCarolyn Wolff Dorros of Wolff Companies, said Richardson snapped up the penultimate parcel available for development in the Energy Corridor, a business district in West Houston home to several major energy companies. The last undeveloped parcel is a 15.2-acre tract south of Richardson\u2019s purchase. So far, it\u2019s attracted the attention of entertainment and hospitality concepts, Dorros said.\nCheaper land in the exurbs is driving many multifamily developers outward, Dorros said.\n\u201cSome of the multifamily market has almost leapfrogged us,\u201d Dorros said. \u201cApartment developers are getting quite aggressive in terms of going further out, especially if there\u2019s good school districts.\u201d\nRelatively slower multifamily construction has helped the Houston market avoid rent declines that hit other Texas metros last year, especially Austin. However,\nHouston apartments below Class A have been losing occupants\nfor the past year.\n",

Other federal holdings such as those owned by the U.S. Postal Service, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of the Interior, National Park Service, and the Army Corps of Engineers make the federal government the largest landowner in the San Antonio metropolitan area, which includes Atascosa, Bandera, Bexar, Comal, Guadalupe, Kendall, Medina and Wilson counties.\nThe State of Texas is next in terms of property ownership in the region, and it\u2019s easy to see why, when considering the number of state parks and natural areas dotting the region. The Texas General Land Office holdings include the Alamo (four other historic San Antonio missions fall under the National Park Service). Other landowning state agencies in the region include the Department of Criminal Justice, Department of Transportation, Texas Historical Commission, Permanent School Fund, Veterans Land Board and National Guard Armory Board, plus state healthcare facilities such as the San Antonio State Hospital.\nThe city of San Antonio is the next largest landowner, with dozens of city parks, golf courses, nature trails, bicycle paths and city infrastructure facilities and government buildings. San Antonio International Airport and Stinson-Mission Municipal Airport are owned by the city, as are the Alamodome and Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center.\n\nOther top landowners include ranchland and other large swaths of rural Texas that have been held by families for generations. The George Robinson-owned 74Ranch is a 27,000-acre area managed for hunting game animals. The Peeler family\u2019s Peeler Ranch comprises 21,000 acres of cattle ranching for wagyu and akaushi breeds. The E.L. Ranch, owned by Steven and Lee Stockseth, spans more than 10,900 acres and operates as a cattle operation and also offers whitetail deer hunting. The next five-biggest land owners in the region hold 8,000 to 10,000 acres each.\nWhile many of these ranches have been intact over many decades, prices and competition for land in the region have spiked since the pandemic as people left cities while investors sought to park capital in large properties in partnership with farmers and ranchers.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The developer also needs a zoning change to build between two and five stories.\nAmerican Ventures is also negotiating an economic development agreement with the city for tax abatements, but the details haven\u2019t been disclosed.\nThe buildout would take place across three phases, wrapping up in 2031. Documents estimate the project could eventually generate $66.1 million in sales and property taxes for Hays County and $145 million in property, sales and hotel taxes for the city.\n\nThe location for the project would be yet another development filling in land within the rapidly growing Austin-San Antonio corridor.
