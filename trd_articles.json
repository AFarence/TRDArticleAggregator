        "content": "Multifamily developers Bruce Menin, Erik Rutter and Joe Lubeck say South Florida needs more housing, but skittish equity investment is among the many barriers to entry.\nThe trio, who spoke during\nThe Real Deal\nMiami Real Estate Forum 2025, pushed back on the notion the tri-county region is struggling with a supply overhang due to hefty completions in recent years. Instead, demand is high and supply is low for the highest quality apartments, the developers said.\nLast year, a\nrecord 18,600 apartments\nwere completed in South Florida, outpacing 15,000 net new leases, according to CoStar Group. Developers started construction of another 14,515 units in the year that ended Sept. 30, outpacing construction starts during the same period of last year.\nThe notion that developers are saturating South Florida has been an ongoing theme in the region\u2019s history, Lubeck, CEO of Tampa-based American Landmark, said at the \u201cToo Much, Too Fast? Rethinking South Florida\u2019s Apartment Boom\u201d panel hosted by\nTRD\ncommercial real estate reporter Francisco Alvarado.\n\u201cFor the last 10 years \u2026 they said, \u2018It\u2019s overbuilt, it\u2019s overbuilt, it\u2019s overbuilt.\u2019 But it\u2019s really not overbuilt,\u201d Lubeck said. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly ebb and flow in the ability to raise rents and, of course, construction costs and the like. But overall, it\u2019s all about job growth and population growth.\u201d\nAnd the tri-county region has both residential and employment growth, the panelists said. Roughly 80,000 households are projected to move to South Florida in the next five years, with 40 percent of them expected to rent, according to Menin, founding principal of Miami-based Crescent Heights.\n\u201cWe know that our nation is under-supplied in housing,\u201d Menin said.\nAmerican Landmark subsidiary Electra America and the Toledano family\u2019s BH Group are redeveloping a portion of Cutler Bay\u2019s Southland Mall into\nSouth Place City Center\nwith roughly 5,000 apartments, a hotel, medical offices, retail on outparcels and a community amphitheater. They are renovating a portion of the existing mall and demolishing some of the retail buildings, including Sears and Kmart.\nCrescent Heights completed the 40-story, 588-unit\nForma Miami\napartment tower in Edgewater last year. The building, which is at least 97 percent leased, is billed by developers as a premier quality tower setting a new standard for the area. This is the first of six towers on 9 contiguous acres Crescent owns, Menin said.\nRutter is co-founder of Oak Row Equities, which has two multifamily towers under construction in Miami\u2019s Edgewater, and this year completed the mixed-use\nWynwood Plaza\nwith 509 apartments.\nMultifamily analysts and leasing companies say South Florida\u2019s hefty building completions are\nconcentrated\nin top Miami areas such as Edgewater and Wynwood, or exactly where Oak Row is developing. But Rutter countered the idea that these areas are over-supplied, arguing the issue is a lack of top-quality apartments that are in high demand.\n\u201cThere was a big wave of supply that came online between 2018 and call it 2021, and the vast majority of that was low-rise. Maybe some of the corners were cut to get projects out of the ground, quickly delivered [with] very small units,\u201d Rutter said. \u201cThe renter pool has grown more sophisticated.\u201d\nAt Wynwood Plaza, which Rutter described as \u201cunquestionably the best\u201d building in Wynwood, demand is strong, with leasing velocity of about 35 units per month, he said. Yet, he conceded Oak Row is offering a month free to incentivize leasing.\n\u201cThere\u2019s other projects that have just delivered surrounding us. Of course, there are some concessions in the market. That\u2019s marketing,\u201d he said, adding this will probably be phased out once the building is 75 percent leased.\nThe true issue for South Florida\u2019s multifamily market is skittish equity, the panelists said, again arguing that only top sponsors and projects in premier neighborhoods can get investment.\nDebt markets are \u201crobust,\u201d but investment has dried in \u201cthe traditional pure play common [limited partner] equity, Rutter said, adding that may not be a bad thing. \u201cIt\u2019s going to quell supply naturally, and then institutional capital markets are going to open up again, cycle back in.\u201d\nThe trio differed in their views of developing in Broward and Palm Beach counties.\nPalm Beach County has prospered with the \u201cstaggering\u201d number of corporate moves and wealth in-migration, but it\u2019s more difficult to justify development of high-end apartments in Fort Lauderdale, Rutter said. Because construction costs are so expensive, Oak Row would have to charge the same rents as it does in Miami\u2019s Edgewater.\n\u201cI can\u2019t extrapolate why you are going to get that in Fort Lauderdale,\u201d he said.\nLubeck is more open to suburban areas such as west Broward, Jupiter and Palm Beach Gardens.\n\u201cI am very concerned about overbuilding on the side of the river\u201d in Fort Lauderdale, he said, referring to the New River.\nIn September, Crescent Heights\u2019 Russell Galbut, through his GFO Investments, and InSite Group, Atlas Hill Real Estate and Prime Finance paid\n$73 million\nfor the\nGalleria Fort Lauderdale\n, with plans to redevelop the mall.\n\u201cWe\u2019re planning several thousand units,\u201d Menin said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have picked up just any site. But this is a placemaking opportunity.\u201d\nMenin, who lives in Manhattan, also offered a more tempered view on the consistent topic of discussion at the forum of whether Zohran Mamdani\u2019s mayoral win will prompt an influx of New Yorkers to South Florida.\n\u201cPeople love Miami. They love New York. There\u2019s a similar DNA to the kind of people that are attracted to both markets. \u2026 I think people are going to continue to move back and forth,\u201d Menin said. \u201cI think we have to take a little bit of a wait and see.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Housing demolition in San Francisco has been exceedingly rare over the last decade-plus, averaging out to about 18 units per year since 2012. City planners credit this to what they recently called \u201csome of the strongest demolition and\ntenant protection\ncontrols in the country.\u201d\nThose controls are now poised to become even stronger.\nThe city\u2019s planning commission greenlit a tenant protection omnibus this week that aims to further discourage residential demolitions and require more from landlords and developers whose projects could displace existing tenants. The proposal, known as the tenant protection ordinance, is headed to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors for a final vote.\nIn classic San Francisco fashion, the proposal takes existing state law and enhances it. California\u2019s Housing Crisis Act of 2019 already prohibits any net loss of rent-controlled or affordable apartments. If a redevelopment project requires the demolition of a property\u2019s\naffordable\nor\nrent-controlled\napartments, they are required to build at least as many units, with at least as many bedrooms.\nIf passed, San Francisco\u2019s rules would require each of those replacement units to have the same number of full bathrooms, and at least 90 percent of the square footage. As with state law, the replacement units must remain as affordable as the originals.\nThe proposal also expands protection to more tenants.\nState law only affords tenant protections to those who live in a unit when the property owner submits a development application. Tenant protections include rights such as the ability to remain in a property for up to 6 months prior to demolition, relocation benefits, first refusal on replacement units, and the right to return if property owner changes course and returns the original units to the rental market.\nSan Francisco\u2019s new rules would expand those protections to tenants who have vacated the property due to a capital improvement project, have left the property within the last five years due to harassment or a non-compliant buyout, or tenants displaced within the last five years by an owner who decided to move back into the property and take it off the rental market.\nProperty owners would need to inform tenants of the protections, and tenants would also be granted a right of private action against a property owner or developer who violates requirements.\nThe proposal arrives against the backdrop of what many see as a looming upzoning in neighborhoods across the city.\nMayor Daniel Lurie\u2019s Family Zoning Plan\n\u2014 aimed at making room for 82,000 state-mandated units by 2031 \u2014 is plodding through the approval process.\nGov. Gavin Newsom\nrecently signed SB 79\n, Sacramento\u2019s marquee housing bill this session, which could upzone properties within a half-mile of transit stops as soon as next summer.\nWhere talks of rezoning increase, fears around displacement often follow.\nAhead of casting their votes, commissioners celebrated the proposal. Commissioner Derek Braun called it \u201ca great day\u201d and Commissioner Kathrin Moore said the ordinance represented \u201cone of the most collaborative efforts I\u2019ve seen in a long time.\u201d\nCommissioner Gilbert Williams said he welcomed the protections, but said his vote came \u201cwith a heavy heart.\u201d\n\u201cThere are a lot of vulnerable tenants out there, and it\u2019s very unfortunate that we\u2019re in this situation,\u201d Williams said, referencing the proposed upzoning throughout the city. \u201cOur residents deserve a lot better than what they\u2019re being faced with here.\u201d",

        "content": "Developer Edgardo Defortuna and brokerage head Craig Studnicky said the foreign buyers they work with have not been deterred by the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on immigration.\n\u201cThey already have their visa, their status or they already own property here, and they\u2019re trying to [purchase] something better, bigger,\u201d\nDefortuna\n, CEO of Miami-based Fortune International Group, said at\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s Miami Real Estate Forum on Thursday.\nBut he said the shutdown has stalled anyone needing clearance from the consulate.\nForeign buyers\nare still very active\nin South Florida, both panelists said. Mexicans and Brazilians are leading in higher-priced purchases, while\nColombians\nare the top buyers for investment properties in the $1 million to $2.5 million range.\nStudnicky, co-founder and CEO of Aventura-based ISG World and RelatedISG Realty, said Latin Americans are increasingly looking at Broward County, specifically Hollywood, Fort Lauderdale and Pompano Beach.\nThe\nbuyer pool\nhas shifted compared to before the pandemic, from 65 to 70 percent foreign buyers and 30 to 35 percent domestic buyers, to the opposite, Defortuna said.\nAlso a big factor that is happening today is that most of the Latin American currencies have appreciated versus the dollar, which is very, very unusual,\u201d he added. \u201cTypically, the Latin American currencies lose value versus the dollar. In the last six months, pretty much all the currencies in Latin America have appreciated versus the dollar, and that makes it very attractive for them, because they know that it\u2019s temporary, and they know that they should act now, because it\u2019s not going to last.\u201d\nDomestic buyers have dominated the resale market, versus foreign buyers who are more attracted to new developments.\n\u201cThese buildings take a long time to build, and when they\u2019re moving here in the next year or two, [U.S. buyers] simply cannot wait,\u201d Studnicky said.\nForeigners are also doubling down on South Florida real estate as private equity investors in new developments. Defortuna said he used to raise money for projects via hedge funds or New York-based real estate funds.\nPart of the\nlatest rush is through EB-5\napproved projects, Defortuna said. Under the federal program, investors and their families receive visas for financing a development that creates a minimum number of U.S. jobs.\n\u201cDemand has been incredible,\u201d Defortuna said. \u201cBefore, EB-5 used to be mainly Chinese or the Far East, but now the Latin American buyer really understands the process.\u201d\nThe speakers also touched on the effect that Zohran Mamdani\u2019s victory in the New York mayoral race could have on South Florida real estate. While many Florida real estate agents and brokers predict a mass exodus, others are more measured about what to expect.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to uproot my life, my business, my friends, my family, my kids in school, when they have all their friends, because of some 34-year-old kid, without giving New York City a chance to punch back,\u201d Studnicky said. \u201cNew York\u2019s got a spine. I\u2019ve heard a lot of people say we\u2019re going to get this huge wave of people from New York, and I think the comparable in their heads or in their hearts is what happened five years ago during Covid. Slow down. You\u2019re going to get a bump. But I think you\u2019re exaggerating the bump.\u201d\n",

The proposal comes from Hawthorne-based\nLAcarGuy and its CEO Mike Sullivan\n; Toyota of Hollywood was founded in 1957 and is a subsidiary of LAcarGuy, which has 13 auto dealers across Los Angeles County owned by the Sullivan family.\nThe site spans 3.7 acres and would consist of high-rise and low-rise structures including 350 studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments, 136,000 square feet of offices, and about 22,500 square feet of ground-floor commercial space. Houston-based developer Hines is part of the development team.\nThe project, designed by OfficeUntitled, would feature a 35-story residential tower rising 419 feet, a six-story office building, and low-rise residential structures that would seemingly create a townhome-populated, village-style environment. Between the buildings would be about 23,500 square feet of publicly accessible open space designed by landscape architect Relm, including a new plaza opening up to Hollywood Boulevard.\nThe\nPlanning Commission\ntook up two appeals against the project before ultimately upholding its decision to advance it. One was from a coalition of labor unions known as CREED L.A. (Coalition for Responsible Equitable Economic Development Los Angeles), which argued that the project\u2019s environmental impact report didn\u2019t consider several potential hazards that could impact future site occupants. The other was from the owner of an adjacent property, which appealed to the Commission to block the project due to its potential to obscure a cell tower and billboard on his property.\nThe project has gotten some support from business organizations such as the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, as well as building trades unions such as the Western States Regional Council of Carpenters.\nA timeline for completion of the project hasn\u2019t been confirmed after the appeal process, though in 2023, the plan was to break ground in 2026 and finish work in 2029, Urbanize\nreported\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Some of Chicagoland\u2019s most-expensive homes sales this year were in Winnetka, including a record-breaking\n$31.3 million deal\n.\nA Winnetka office is \u201clong overdue\u201d for the brokerage, Mawicke said in a LinkedIn post.\nThe firm sought Mawicke out when it was looking to expand its North Shore presence, said\nMark Pasquesi\n, Jameson Sotheby\u2019s president of real estate services and managing broker for Lake Forest and Winnetka.\nSales in the ritzy suburbs\nare dominated by @properties and Compass, which hold a large share of the area\u2019s listings, but other brokerages are taking their shots in the North Shore.\nPeter Cummins\n, also a former @properties agent, recently jumped from @properties to Baird &amp; Warner to lead a new North Shore team. And Janice Corley\u2019s\nRE/MAX Premier\nbought a handful of offices from Compass in the North Shore to kickstart business there.

The listing agent is Joe Piazza at Coldwell Banker Realty.

        "content": "The Ismaili Center Houston \u2014 the first in the United States \u2014 is officially open after many years of planning and development.\nThe long-anticipated cultural and religious complex debuted Nov. 6 with a ceremony led by\nHis Highness Prince Rahim Aga Khan V\nand\nHouston Mayor John Whitmire\n, marking a major milestone for both the city and the global Ismaili Muslim community, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe project cost wasn\u2019t reported, but a state filing in 2021 pegged it at $176.2 million, or $1,175 per square foot for a project that was planned with a two-story parking structure.\nSet on 11 acres at 2323 Allen Parkway at Montrose Boulevard, the 150,000-square-foot complex is meant to serve not only as a place of worship but also as a public gathering space for people of all faiths.\n\u201cThis building may be called an Ismaili Center, but it is not here for Ismailis only. It is for all Houstonians,\u201d Prince Rahim said at the opening, calling the center a space for \u201cknowledge, reflection and dialogue.\u201d\nThe cooperative nature of the rollout in Houston stands in stark contrast to the\nepic fight state leaders picked\nthis year with\nEPIC City\n, a Muslim-led master-planned community north of Dallas.\nThe Texas Workforce Commission settled a\nFair Housing Act\ncomplaint against Community Capital Partners, the developer of EPIC City, in September. The agency dismissed the complaint after the firm agreed to new housing policies, staff training and compliance reporting, while the developer admitted no wrongdoing.\nThe Houston project fulfills the vision of the late Prince Karim Aga Khan IV, who first purchased the site in 2006 and championed the idea of an American Ismaili Center before his death earlier this year.\nDesigned by London-based architect Farshid Moussavi, in collaboration with landscape architect Thomas Woltz of\nNelson Byrd Woltz\n, the center aims to embody the Ismaili philosophy of harmony between people, place and nature. The Washington, D.C.-based Aga Khan Foundation USA oversaw development, with Omaha\u2019s DLR Group serving as architect of record and McCarthy Building Companies as general contractor.\nThe center is framed by 9 acres of gardens, shaded terraces and water features. The building\u2019s triangular fa\u00e7ade doubles as a thermal and light filter, casting patterned sunlight across custom concrete floors that echo the geometric traditions of Islamic design. The theme continues throughout the interior, from perforated wooden walls inscribed in Kufic script to ceilings that conceal structural beams and air ducts behind intricate triangular screens.\nThe centerpiece is the prayer hall, a column-free space nearly the size of two basketball courts, able to accommodate 1,500 worshipers.\nIts orientation toward Mecca required rotating the structure 45 degrees off the site\u2019s grid, inspiring the triangular motif repeated throughout. Above it sits a grand veranda \u2014 or eivan \u2014 intended for weddings and public events, in keeping with Persian palace traditions.\nThe Ismaili Center joins six others worldwide, in London, Vancouver, Lisbon, Dubai, Dushanbe and Toronto.\nHouston, home to the country\u2019s largest Ismaili Muslim population at roughly 40,000, was a natural choice for the first U.S. site, center spokesperson Omar Samji said. The project\u2019s LEED-seeking design also reflects Houston\u2019s growing identity as a global city that merges culture, faith and sustainability.\nWhitmire called the complex a \u201cbeacon of light\u201d for the city\u2019s diverse communities.\n\u201cThe Ismaili Center truly reflects the best of Houston\u2019s spirit: our diversity, our compassion, and our commitment to community,\u201d Whitmire said.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Social media can be a very powerful tool, but simply chasing likes or trying to go \u201cviral\u201d won\u2019t do anything to help a real estate professional\u2019s career, panelists warned during a discussion on the business of digital marketing during\nThe Real Deal\nMiami Forum on Thursday.\nMichael Ruiz, president and CEO of\nLegendary Productions\n, a company in Miami and Austin that promotes\nluxury homes\n, said being obnoxious or shocking might please \u201csomeone in another country who is sitting in their underwear liking a video,\u201d but it won\u2019t do anything to help close a deal.\n\u201cIf I were a real estate agent\u2026 [I\u2019d look] at the top five, top 10 people who are actually selling and making money. They\u2019re not dancing on tables or doing those skits like whatever-her-name-is does in Tampa,\u201d said Ruiz, who has at least 500,000 followers on Legendary\u2019s Instagram, a highly viewed home tour YouTube channel. \u201cThey\u2019re presenting their properties in a professional manner and presenting themselves in a way that separates them from\u2026 the masses. So, the reality is, these people who are selling are going to continue to sell, and the people that are doing all this trendy stuff are going to fall out eventually.\u201d\nThe person from Tampa that Ruiz referred to was Breanna Banaciski, also known as Tampa Bre, a real estate agent in the Tampa metro area affiliated with Realty One Group Advantage who makes sarcastic humorous videos of properties on Instagram and Tiktok that have attracted hundreds of thousands of followers.\n\u201cShe got a big write-up in the New York Times a few weeks ago,\u201d said\nTRD\nreporter Kate Hinsche, the panel\u2019s moderator. \u201cYou might know her tagline. \u2018This house has more bush than my mom in the \u201880s.\u2019\u201d\nBut Glennda Baker, president and CEO of Atlanta-based Glennda Baker &amp; Associates, said she didn\u2019t find Banaciski\u2019s video shorts amusing.\n\u201cYeah, she makes my head spin around and snot fly out of my nose,\u201d Baker said. \u201cWe sell homes that are usually people\u2019s single largest asset. We sell homes where people live their lives and bring their families and bring their friends and create milestones. And the mere fact that someone would be so disrespectful to that home, to that property, makes me violent. I\u2019m sorry, I probably shouldn\u2019t have said that. But it just, it really angers me. It is such a poor reflection of our industry. We are professionals. We get paid a lot of money to be professional. The worst agents are highly overpaid, and the best agents are highly undervalued, and when someone like that gets a following or gets spotlighted that scares the hell out of me.\u201d\nThe content \u201ceveryone in this room\u201d should be focused on is \u201ccreating content that is valuable to the consumer,\u201d added Baker, who has 875,000 followers on TikTok and 327,000 followers on Instagram.\nBaker, who has worked in real estate for more than 30 years, said she started creating content on social media in 2016. But it wasn\u2019t until 2020, after she hired a videographer, that her standing in social media grew. She now spends about four hours each month shooting 30 to 50 unscripted evergreen videos for days she is unable to post live, or at all.\n\u201cThe ideas come to me throughout the month. I have Google Forms on the homepage of my phone, and when I get an idea, I open up my phone, I put the idea in there. Then, when I sit with my videographer, I open my laptop and we go down the list,\u201d Baker said. \u201c[It\u2019s] really very structured because I post a video every day.\u201d\nThose clips can be stories about what it took to close a house, giving advice on real estate, or \u201cthe good, the bad, and the ugly\u201d stories, such as chasing a rat out of an attic and \u201ccleaning up the shit pellets\u201d or venting about a bad inspection.\n\u201cI do say bad words, and that may not be professional, but I\u2019m weeding out the riffraff by doing that\u2026cause if you\u2019re going to do business with me, and you think you\u2019re going to get somebody who\u2019s all buttoned up, you probably are looking in the wrong spot,\u201d she said, adding that she sold 27 houses on Tinder.\nAlyssa Morgan,\nfounder and senior agent of Miami Beach-based The Inside Network, said she uses social media to not only showcase her properties, but also to show pieces of her life, such as dinner with her husband, doing Pilates or going to a Mommy and Me class. \u201cMy goal with my [Instagram] page is to make you feel like you know me before you even know me, so I really am posting throughout my day, and it\u2019s just like what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\nMorgan, who has 22,000 followers on Instagram, does this so people \u201cfeel comfortable enough to reach out to me\u201d about properties.\nIt\u2019s also important to \u201ctag\u201d places and people whenever possible when posting on Instagram, added Ruiz, who has collaborated with Morgan.\n\u201cTag, tag, tag everything you do\u2026. because then she reposts, I repost, she reposts, everybody starts seeing it. It\u2019s the easiest thing in the world,\u201d Ruiz said.\n\u201cA little trick that I used to do when I first started is I would get a listing, let\u2019s say at the\nCarillon\n, then I would go through the geotag and reach out to everyone that tagged themselves and send them my listing,\u201d Morgan later added. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of like how I built my Miami followers.\u201d\nMorgan said she\u2019s managed to get listings, find buyer leads and close deals from her Instagram audience and followers.\nAnd that\u2019s the whole purpose of social media, to help create your own brand and bring value and visibility for your clients\u2019 homes, Baker said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about virality and vanity,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not over here being a comedian who is trying to sell real estate to create content, I\u2019m creating content to sell real estate.\u201d",

        "content": "The South Side apartment building that was subject to a controversial federal raid last month has been officially deemed too unsafe for tenants to continue living in.\nCook County Circuit Court Judge Debra Seaton issued an order Nov. 7 to appoint a receiver to the 7500 South South Shore Drive property and requested that the receiver, Friedman Real Estate, help the remaining tenants relocate.\n\u201cThe conditions are just ridiculous,\u201d a tenant said at the Nov. 7 receivership hearing. \u201cThere is sewage on both corners of the first floor. Maintenance doesn\u2019t do anything. The security is just crazy, no doors are secure and anyone can just walk in.\u201d\nAbout half a dozen tenants testified about the conditions of the property at the hearing. Seaton ordered that their names and unit numbers not be shared publicly.\nAfter hundreds of agents from the FBI, ATF and ICE led a massive overnight raid on the South Shore building last month, many tenants voluntarily moved out.\nThe Sept. 30 operation drew national attention for its intensity as well as criticism from local officials who called the tactics heavy-handed and questioned if it violated the rights of tenants who were detained temporarily but not ultimately arrested.\nThe operation yielded 37 arrests, some of which the Department of Homeland Security noted were for drug trafficking and weapons charges while others were for immigration violations. Additional details on the arrests have been scarce and records requests from\nThe Real Deal\nfor further information have been denied or not returned.\nAmid an escalating legal-back-and-forth between Wells Fargo and the building\u2019s owner, a little-known Wisconsin-based investor named Trinity Flood, the raid thrust the South Side building\u2019s longstanding troubles into the spotlight.\nWells Fargo, acting as a trustee on behalf of bond holders, filed a $27 million foreclosure lawsuit against Flood in April, claiming she was behind on mortgage payments tied to the South Shore building as well as several others across Chicago and the U.S.\nThough Flood initially fought back against Wells Fargo\u2019s attempts to have a receiver appointed to the property, her attorney said at the Nov. 7 hearing that they were no longer opposing the motion. He did, however, say that they reserved the right to oppose the appointment of a receiver at any of Flood\u2019s other properties.\nSince the raid, between 30 to 40 tenants still live at the 13-unit property. Several of them told Seaton at the Nov. 7 hearing that they would like to move out and that it continues to be subject to vandalism and trespassing. Multiple tenants testified that they would have moved out already if they had the financial means to do so.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unlivable right now due to the ICE raid, the immigrants, the Venezuelans and the flooding,\u201d one tenant said, though it was unclear if the tenant meant that migrants do or do not still currently occupy the building. \u201cI lost a lot of stuff due to the raid. It\u2019s just unbearable right now.\u201d\nAcknowledging that it may be difficult for the tenants to find housing during the holiday season and without financial assistance, Seaton said the hazardous conditions at the property are still too severe to allow anyone to continue living there.\nA broken elevator, a potential gas leak, threat of carbon monoxide poisoning from faulty boilers, an insufficient number of working carbon monoxide detectors and significant electrical wiring issues were all cited as major causes for concern from city inspectors and the judge.\n\u201cThe court has some real concerns about the electrical problems,\u201d Seaton said. \u201cIt is like a trap, waiting for a fire.\u201d\nShe ordered that the receiver begin working on resolving safety issues as soon as possible and search for programs available to help tenants with relocation costs.\nSeaton also gave the receiver authority to begin the eviction process for squatters reported at the property, which is a notoriously difficult legal procedure in Illinois. A recent change to state law to improve that process\ndoes not take effect until the new year.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m the only tenant left on this floor that isn\u2019t a squatter,\u201d said one tenant, adding that there appear to be squatters on every floor of the five-story building.\nAnother tenant alleged trespassers have vandalized the property and possibly used it as a place to engage in drug dealing and prostitution.\nBefore the raid, the building was cited for numerous code violations from the city of Chicago and city inspectors noted over the summer that the property manager, Corey Oliver of Strength in Management, was no longer able to \u201cre-assert control over the building.\u201d\nDuring another hearing regarding Wells Fargo\u2019 receivership request that took place shortly after the Sept. 30 raid, Oliver said he had hired armed security guards to patrol the building from 6PM to 6AM nightly.\nAt the time, Seaton acknowledged Oliver\u2019s efforts to improve conditions at the property and held off on appointing a receiver. Instead, she ordered a follow-up inspection for Nov. 6 and a hearing to reconsider the issue Nov. 7.\nShe also asked that tenants attend the Nov. 7 hearing to provide their perspective on the conditions and tell the court whether or not they wanted to move out. Though the overall conditions would dictate her final decision, Seaton said she would also consider tenants\u2019 willingness to move in her ruling.\nAt the Nov. 7 hearing, tenants revealed that the security guards provided little help to the building and were no longer employed there.\n\u201cI am sure they were disgusted by being here,\u201d a tenant said of the security guards. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even sit in the building, they sat at the entrance or in their cars.\u201d\nOliver confirmed he had fired the security guards because they had not adequately protected the building and allowed vandalism to take place while they were on duty. But he defended his efforts to improve conditions in a short period of time.\n\u201cWe have protected lighting in the stairwells, we are constantly removing garbage and constantly mopping up the floors,\u201d Oliver said and added that squatters may be the root of the issues. \u201cIt\u2019s one step forward and two steps back.\u201d\nFlood\u2019s attorney said perception of the property so far has been \u201cone-sided.\u201d\nSeaton disagreed.\n\u201cI have heard more than one side of the story. I have heard this case on two different occasions and gave instructions to the property manager and they are still not done and I have pictures,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying the property manager hasn\u2019t taken some steps but he hasn\u2019t taken enough\u2026 God forbid a fire occurs in this building and the people get burned up \u2026 the court will not allow that.\u201d\nSome tenants noted that issues at the property had been piling up for some time and only gained attention after the raid.\n\u201cI thought this was a great location at first but I would love to relocate,\u201d said one tenant. \u201cThis building hadn\u2019t gotten coverage before the ICE situation but this building has been in decline for two years.\u201d\nCity code violations and foreclosure records also state conditions at the building started to decline well before the raid took place.\nSometime in the last two years, the conditions at the property deteriorated rapidly, despite it undergoing a multimillion renovation shortly before Flood bought it in 2020.\nSeaton said the efforts made since the raid were too little, too late.\n\u201cThe court does acknowledge that your property management has tried to remediate some of the conditions,\u201d Seaton said to Oliver. \u201cBut the court has found that the remediation has not been sufficient to make the building safe and habitable which is why the court is appointing a receiver to relocate the tenants and if necessary to evict the squatters.\u201d",

        "content": "Sometimes suing for perfection can bring change, even after years of litigation.\nA six-year legal fight over the construction of Laura Ricketts\u2019 $13 million\nWilmette\nlakefront mansion ended with the Chicago Cubs co-owner recovering only a fraction of what she sought.\nAn arbitration panel awarded Ricketts roughly $600,000 \u2014 about 12 percent of her $5 million exterior claims \u2014 after rejecting the bulk of her complaints against LG Construction Group, the home\u2019s builder, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nRicketts accused LG and architecture firm\nMorgante Wilson\nof botching everything from millwork and windows to the radiant heating system in her six-bedroom Sheridan Road estate.\nRicketts bought the property in the 400 block of Sheridan Road in Wilmette for $6.5 million under a trust in 2010,\nThe Real Deal\nfirst\nreported\n. Construction on the home began in 2012 and continued until 2016. Ricketts and her family moved into the home in 2015 while work was ongoing that ultimately cost $12.8 million.\nRicketts, who also co-owns the Chicago Sky and Chicago Red Stars, began documenting more than 1,500 alleged defects soon after moving in, claiming the problems added $7 million to the project\u2019s price tag. Morgante Wilson settled privately with her before arbitration began, leaving LG to face the claims.\nThe arbitrators found that Ricketts failed to prove most of her allegations, concluding that none of the interior issues \u2014 which totaled $8 million \u2014 stemmed from construction defects. Instead, they sided with LG\u2019s argument that the complaints reflected \u201can improper standard of perfection\u201d and normal wear and tear after nearly a decade in the home.\nThe decision followed a year of arbitration hearings and testimony spanning more than 12,000 pages.\n\u201cOur construction quality and our reputation have been validated,\u201d\nLG principal\nBrian Goldberg told the outlet.\nThe $600,000 award was fully covered by subcontractor settlements and insurance, according to LG\u2019s legal team at Traub Lieberman. Goldberg said his firm did not pay any portion of the award out of pocket but acknowledged the company is still recouping legal costs after years of defense.\nRicketts, through a spokesperson, declined to comment. Arbitration proceedings are private, and details of the settlement and the arbitrators\u2019 identities are confidential.\nThe dispute centered on questions of liability and patience.\nGoldberg said Ricketts didn\u2019t notify LG of many alleged defects until years after moving in, denying the builder a chance to make repairs. Among her complaints were leaks, warped woodwork, uneven floors and roofing failures in a glass-walled \u201cLake Room\u201d facing Lake Michigan.\n",

        "content": "A recently opened senior living community in\nLos Gatos\nhas come under new ownership.\nHarrison Street Real Estate, an affiliate of Chicago-based Harrison Street Asset Management, bought the Ivy Park at Los Gatos complex for $54 million, the Mercury News\nreported\n. The seller was a joint venture between two Bay Area real estate firms, Vacaville-based Chronograph Properties and San Jose-based Swenson, which developed the property that opened in May of this year.\nThe 114-unit community at 400 Blossom Hill Road in Los Gatos sold for well above its assessed value from January of this year of $38.4 million. Harrison Street Real Estate has been a repeat investor in senior living communities, investing approximately $14.6 billion in senior housing assets for a total of 43,000 combined units in the two decades since its founding.\nThe sale of the resort-style Ivy Park complex was part of a six-property portfolio transaction from Harrison Street, which partnered with senior living company Oakmont Senior Living and general contractor Blue Mountain Enterprises to acquire the properties. Harrison Street purchased the properties through HSRE BME Blossom Hill Road LLC, a joint-venture entity created with Blue Mountain Enterprises.\nThe 669-unit purchase includes five operational senior communities in California and one empty development site scheduled for completion with new residences in 2027, Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The other properties are in Santa Rosa, Bakersfield, Vallejo and\nFairfield\n,\nper\nthe Silicon Valley Business Journal. The overall sale price was more than $200 million for the six-property portfolio.\nThe sale comes as\nnew construction of multifamily properties in the Bay Area slows\n, with ground-up and redevelopment projects becoming fewer and farther between. In Oakland, for example, Ellis Partners is\nseeking to turn a former American National Red Cross building\ninto a seven-story, 197-unit senior housing facility.\nMeanwhile, near Los Gatos in San Jose, Shashi Group is\nseeking to convert the Aloft San Jose Cupertino hotel\ninto a senior residential care facility. That plan calls for an 80-unit complex offering assisted living and memory care.\nHarrison Street previously\nbought the 94-room Oakmont at Silver Creek\nsenior living facility\u00a0 in San Jose in 2023 for $50.8 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The property, at 3500 Hillridge Drive, had racked up 1,458 code violations, and nearly 100 lawsuits were filed against Venetos and property managers regarding the conditions at the property.\nEven so, the filing said residents still had no water, sewer or gas at the complex.\nVenetos responded, asking the court to dissolve the order.

        "content": "The Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office is cracking down on rental scammers \u2014 and the timing could be an opportunity for rental agents.\nProsecutors on Thursday charged a 35-year-old man with identity theft and other crimes after he allegedly duped a would-be subletter out of rent money. The case comes after the DA recently charged two other men in similar schemes.\nIn the latest indictment, prosecutors claim Anthony Pittman stole a woman\u2019s identity and forged documents to rent a luxury apartment in Murray Hill, only to sublet it to another tenant. The unit at the center of the case is a building on Third Avenue called the Aurora, where one-bedrooms rent for about $4,600, according to\nCrain\u2019s New York\n.\nJust weeks before announcing the charges, prosecutors also accused 36-year-old Adam Chatwin of\nfalsely posing\nas the landlord of a Midtown studio only to pocket $32,000 in upfront costs from four prospective tenants. Turns out, Chatwin was only subletting the place for a month.\nThe clampdown is coming as rents are growing increasingly\nmore expensive\nand as the topic of affordable housing is top of mind for most New Yorkers on the heels of a mayoral election where candidates campaigned on solving the crisis.\nBut it\u2019s also arriving as the city\u2019s rental agents on both the landlord and tenant side have been scrambling to redefine their worth after the \u201cbroker fee ban\u201d\ntook effect\nin June. With many owners newly footing the bill for broker fees \u2014 and questioning whether they should \u2014 agents are searching for fresh ways to justify their role.\nThe scams may seem unrelated to rental agents\u2019 plight, but as one broker pointed out a couple of months ago, one of the benefits to hiring an agent is to vet and verify prospective tenants.\n\u201cA for-rent-by-owner reached out to me, and I told him, \u2018it\u2019s going to cost you more money to hire me, but I\u2019ll get you a qualified person,\u2019\u201d Corcoran\u2019s Shloma Hecht said in September. \u201cYou can do it by yourself and maybe collect the rent on the front end. But this isn\u2019t about the first month\u2019s rent. It\u2019s about 12 or 24 months of rent.\u201d\nLandlords \u201cthink they\u2019re going to save a couple of dollars to do it themselves,\u201d Hecht added. \u201cBut brokers get a better sense if someone is serious or not.\u201d\nNot so fast\u2026\nThe residential market in Downtown Manhattan was already hot \u2014 but a couple of new, pricey listings could turn the temperature up higher.\nEarlier this week, filmmaker Neil Burger and his wife, architect Diana Kellogg, listed their townhouse in Tribeca for $30 million. The couple bought the 40-foot-wide home at 4 Staple Street for just $1.7 million in 2002.\nBuilt in 1868, the property spans 4,100 square feet and has three bedrooms and three bathrooms. It also includes a 2,500-square-foot studio, office and wine cellar at 1 Jay Street as well as roughly 3,000 potential extra square feet of air rights.\nBurger, known for movies such as \u201cLimitless\u201d and \u201cDivergent,\u201d and Kellogg listed their abode just a week after news of another expensive listing below 14th Street dropped.\nDeveloper Alf Naman is preparing to list a penthouse at his\nboutique condo at 125 Perry Street\nfor a whopping $85 million \u2014 a figure that could give a pending deal at a nearby new development a run for its money.\nThe penthouse, one of seven condos at the former parking garage, will likely be the most expensive listing downtown and among the top five in all of Manhattan once it hits the market.\nIf it scores a deal close to its asking price, it could challenge a penthouse at Aurora Capital Associates\u2019 140 Jane Street which found a buyer in August with an asking price of\n$88 million\n.\nThe deal hasn\u2019t yet closed, so the actual price of the sale is still unknown. But unless the developer offloaded it for a discount of tens of millions, the trade is likely to set a new record for a condo sale in Downtown Manhattan, a bar that was just raised in March when a condo at the Witkoff Group\u2019s 150 Charles sold for\n$60 million\n.\nHowever, there\u2019s likely another contender in the race to break the Downtown record: Atlas Capital and Zeckendorf Development\u2019s 80 Clarkson. The team behind the project has been tight-lipped about its deals, but judging from\nsome of the pricing\nreleased in its offering plan, big ticket trades are surely on the horizon once the building begins closing.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe priciest deal recorded in the city rolls this week was for a townhouse on the Upper East Side, which sold for $16.8 million, or $2,700 per square foot. The five-story property at 48 East 81st Street hit the market last September asking $19 million.\nThe 7,400-square-foot abode, built in 1924 and gut-renovated in 2019, has six bedrooms and seven bathrooms. It also features seven marble fireplaces, a roof deck and solarium.\nSociete Real Estate\u2019s Sarah Wiliams and Peter Stack had the listing, along with Douglas Elliman\u2019s Madeline Hult Elghanayan, Allison Chalfin and George Vanderploeg.\n",

Business First\nreported\n.\nThe airport at 12101 Crenshaw Boulevard is on an 80-acre property with 190,000 square feet of airport, office and hangar space. It was previously owned by the City of Hawthorne, which has used it as an aviation reliever airport. The price amounts to $663 per square foot.\nArcher plans to base operations for a planned air taxi network in Los Angeles at the airport.\nThe company specializing in electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles was selected as the official air taxi partner of the LA28 Olympic Games.\nArcher is also the exclusive air taxi partner for the Los Angeles Sports &amp; Entertainment Commission, which supports Los Angeles as a host city for the 2026 FIFA World Cup and Super Bowl LXI, slated to take place at\nSoFi Stadium in Inglewood\nin 2027.\nBesides running its operations out of the Hawthorne Airport, Archer plans to use the facility as an \u201cinnovation testbed\u201d for its artificial intelligence-powered aviation technologies, including AI-powered air traffic and ground operations management.\nAt the same time as it acquired the Hawthorne Municipal Airport, Archer announced that it raised $650 million in additional equity capital. The company\u2019s total liquidity is now more than $2 billion.\nTo successfully operate a region-wide air taxi program, especially with a high-traffic event like the Olympics or World Cup, several\ntakeoff and landing sites\nwill need to be established for Archer\u2019s operations.\nLast month,\nCushman &amp; Wakefield was tapped\nby Atlantic Aviation subsidiary VertiPorts by Atlantic to secure leases for \u201cvertiports,\u201d or landing pads for eVTOL vehicles. Archer plans to offer 10- to 20-minute flights between SoFi Stadium, Los Angeles International Airport and various locations from Santa Monica to Orange County.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Nearly six years after COVID lockdowns forced office workers across the country to work from home, employees are still making their way back into the office, with San Ramon\u2019s Bishop Ranch complex leading the way.\nThe mixed-use neighborhood has seen approximately 60 percent of its workforce physically based at Bishop Ranch return to work, the Mercury News\nreported\n. That\u2019s up from around 53% for the year prior, per Placer data cited by Bishop Ranch owner and operator Sunset Development.\nBy contrast, the return-to-office rate was 49 percent in Silicon Valley and 41.8 percent in San Francisco, per Kastle Access Control System data cited by the Mercury News. San Francisco\nclimbed out of last place nationally\nin RTO rates earlier this year.\nEmployees are also seemingly spending more time at the office once they arrive. Average office dwell times at Bishop Ranch have climbed back up to 96 percent of pre-pandemic levels, representing daily stints at the office ranging from 5.4 to 6.3 hours. Some office neighborhoods at Bishop Ranch have even seen daily office stays exceed pre-pandemic levels.\nBishop Ranch is in the midst of a transformation from an office campus into a community complete with offices, housing, retail, restaurant, entertainment and lodging space. About 8,000 homes are in active planning or under construction at the San Ramon enclave.\nThe hope is that the increase in on-site living will in turn drive up return-to-office rates and office stay times. Sunset Development noted that walking to work has increased 11.8 percent since 2019, while commutes of 10 minutes or less have grown 28.2 percent. The positive trends seem to speak to Bishop Ranch being a \u201cdynamic environment where businesses, employees and residents all benefit,\u201d according to\nSunset Development CEO Alex Mehran Jr.\nLast month, the City of San Ramon signed off on\nplans for Bishop Ranch\u2019s first fully affordable housing development\n. The 200-unit project from Eden Housing at 2453 Camino Ramon will bring residences for seniors and families to a 2.2-acre site donated by Sunset Development. That includes a 120-unit residential building for working families and 80 separate residences for seniors.\nWhile more workers are returning to the office at Bishop Ranch, offices in general at the development seem to be shrinking, not growing. Several offices across Bishop Ranch are either slated for or in the process of\nbeing converted into housing\n. The East Bay at large is\nexpected to see the most office-to-residential conversions\nin the Bay Area over the next five years.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "One developer\u2019s leverage can be a city official\u2019s nightmare as a \u201cseismic shift\u201d is taking place in developments along the outskirts of cities.\nA Texas law has stripped cities\u2019 sway in determining how subdivisions are built and regulated in their extraterritorial jurisdictions, creating flexibility in the eyes of some developers and chaos for neighboring cities.\nThe move stems from Senate Bill 2038 \u2014 the \u201cETJ Opt-Out Bill\u201d \u2014 which allows landowners to remove property from a city\u2019s ETJ, where municipalities can regulate land just beyond their borders, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. The law, which took effect in 2023, unleashed a power shift in development dynamics.\nDevelopers see newfound flexibility in negotiating infrastructure and utilities; cities see chaos.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of the tail wagging the dog,\u201d\nFort Worth\nAssistant City Manager Dana Burghdoff told the outlet. \u201cYou can\u2019t plan for random.\u201d\nWhen nearly 2,000 acres west of Fort Worth sold in 2022, the city of Aledo branded it the \u201cGateway to Aledo,\u201d a sprawling, mixed-use vision known as Dean Ranch.\nTwo years later, that gateway is under new management. Part of Dean Ranch has quietly shifted into the neighboring city of Willow Park through the legal process enacted in SB 2038.\nIn the Aledo case, developer Logan Beall of Beall Development pulled 317 acres out of Fort Worth\u2019s ETJ to join Willow Park, where he\u2019s planning a $500 million community of homes, apartments and light industrial uses near Interstate 20 and FM 1187. Beall said the decision came down to infrastructure.\n\u201cWillow Park had the sewer capacity ready,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cIt allowed us to get going fastest.\u201d\nWillow Park Assistant City Manager Toni Fisher said the city council already approved a development agreement and that other Dean Ranch landowners are exploring similar annexations.\nBut the jurisdictional shuffle sparked friction: Fort Worth and Aledo attorneys accused Willow Park of overstepping by annexing a 10-acre stretch of Bankhead Highway right-of-way. City officials are negotiating behind closed doors.\nStatewide, the new law prompted thousands of \u201cde-annexation\u201d petitions and legal challenges from cities like\nGrand Prairie\n, whose lawsuit was dismissed this spring.\nMeanwhile, cities are racing to adapt. Fort Worth received nearly 5,000 acres\u2019 worth of release requests, according to city data, raising fears of \u201cSwiss cheese\u201d development patterns that disrupt long-term infrastructure planning.\nThe city of Austin had\n191 petitions\nfor \u201cdirect release\u201d in the first two months alone when the law took effect in 2023.\nFor developers, it\u2019s a new era of leverage.\n\u201cHaving a choice is not a bad thing,\u201d Beall said.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The final sales price wasn\u2019t disclosed.\nThe buyer is Hector Martinez Martinez, and the purchase took place in September, according to county records.

Some are extending olive branches in the hopes for a seat at the table with the incoming administration.\n\u201cI want to give the guy a chance,\u201d Brown Harris Stevens CEO Bess Freedman\ntold TRD on Wednesday\n. \u201cHe wants to achieve great things and make people\u2019s lives better, and I respect that.\u201d\nThe chief executive\u2019s tone seems to have shifted from July, when she told the New York Times she considered Mamdani inexperienced, among other concerns.\n\u201cHe\u2019s never even worked at a McDonald\u2019s, let alone run the greatest city in the world,\u201d Freedman told the outlet (though she added that \u201cthe world will clearly not come to an end\u201d if Mamdani were to win the election).\nPeter Riguardi, president of JLL\u2019s New York office, on Wednesday sent employees what he described as a unifying email urging them to \u201cgive him a chance to lead,\u201d adding that \u201cmaybe for those of us who doubt him, he\u2019ll surprise us.\u201d (Not everyone at the company adopted the same conciliatory attitude. A top broker at the firm, Scott Pranzer,\nwas fired\nlater that day over his response to the email, which included comparing Mamdani to Hitler.)\nEven Compass agent Jason Haber, who led a fundraising push for a PAC benefitting Cuomo, changed his tune \u2014 though only slightly.\nAfter Mamdani\u2019s win was announced, Haber said it \u201cwould be foolish to reject everything carte blanche\u201d \u2014 this coming from the man who\npreviously said\n, \u201cevery one of his policies, every one, will make the city less affordable and less livable and less safe\u201d and that Mamdani \u201cseems to have an allergy towards entrepreneurs in this city.\u201d\nBut a win is a win, and it appears real estate is\nready to forgo\nsome of its more harsh criticisms of Mamdani to rally behind the one thing they may have in common with the Assembly member: bringing more housing to New Yorkers.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nDuring third-quarter earnings calls, brokerage executives routinely touted their investments in artificial intelligence technology for agents. But which of those tools are agents actually using and which are just noise? Send your thoughts to\nsheridan.wall@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nRoughly\n125 million commercial airline passengers traveled through\nthe three largest airports in the New York City metropolitan area last year, according to data from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Those airports \u2014 JFK, LaGuardia and Newark \u2014 are among the 40 ordered to reduce operations this week amid the government shutdown.\nElsewhere\u2026\nRepublican congresswoman Elise Stefanik, who represents a district in northern New York, announced on Friday that she plans to enter the race for the state\u2019s next governor,\nABC 7\nreported. Stefanik, known as a strong supporter of President Donald Trump, will challenge the incumbent Gov. Kathy Hochul, of whom she has been a vocal critic.\nFollowing previous denials and a reported push from the president, the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Conservation greenlit a water-quality permit needed to advance a proposed gas pipeline that would run near Staten Island and the Rockaways, according to\nGothamist\n.\nGracie Mansion is haunted, Mayor Eric Adams said during his\ninterview with comedian Ziwe\n. Their discussion began with his efforts to crack down on the city\u2019s rat population and ended with what he looks for in a handshake. Memorable stops in between included a question from Ziwe about why Adams didn\u2019t get a hair transplant during any of his numerous trips to Istanbul, a nod to the federal charges filed against the mayor.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$19 million\nfor 40 Fifth Avenue, PHC. The Greenwich Village co-op unit last sold in 2023 for $17 million. The seller is listed as Randolph Lerner.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$33.3 million\nfor 765 First Avenue. The Turtle Bay rental building has 32 units and is 15,500 square feet. The sale is between two United Nations missions of Qatar and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $65 million for 70 Vestry Street, Unit PHS. The Tribeca condo is 7,800 square feet.\nThe Modlin Group\nhas the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 47,386-square-foot, two-story building at 1200 Manhattan Avenue in Brooklyn. Sherri Privitera of Populous is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann\n",

        "content": "Namdar Realty Group hasn\u2019t necessarily shed its reputation as a bottom feeder while swallowing whole chunks of America\u2019s troubled real estate.\nBut the\nGreat Neck, New York-based firm\n\u2014 led by a family that\u2019s among a bevy of heavyweight real estate players from a Long Island enclave about an hour by train from Manhattan \u2014 is also creating a whole new profile outside its traditional penchant for distressed retail. From\ndiscounted office building deals in Chicago\nto huge development plays on the East Coast, Igal Namdar\u2019s firm is on a dealmaking streak approaching 10 figures.\nOver the past year, Namdar emerged as one of the country\u2019s most dependable buyers of properties in need of a turnaround, with Chicago as its new favorite hunting spot. Between deals in the Windy City it has landed large construction loans to add residential towers to the landscapes of\nJersey City\nand Miami.\nIn the Loop, Namdar and frequent collaborator\nMason Asset Management\njust struck a deal for\n190 South LaSalle Street\nafter a previous buyer backed out, marking their latest in a string of acquisitions across the city\u2019s wounded office and retail sectors. The duo also is snapping up\nState Street retail\nat a steep discount, and earlier this year bought debt on another\nLaSalle Street office tower for pennies\non the dollar.\nTheir retail ambitions have stretched from the Magnificent Mile, where they took control of retail space at\n701 North Michigan Avenue\nlast year, to the region\u2019s\nstruggling malls\n, where they\u2019re battling municipalities and potentially even selling to a group planning to reinvent dead space as a logistics play. Namdar\nsued Calumet City\nearlier this year over its attempt to seize the River Oaks Center, while Ford City Mall, another Namdar property on Chicago\u2019s Southwest Side, is now slated for a sale to\nBridge Industrial\nfor redevelopment as a warehouse conversion.\nIf Chicago is Namdar\u2019s playground, the Bay Area is its frontier \u2014 this week the firm picked up the\nSouthland Mall in Hayward from Brookfield\n, continuing its national spree of buying distressed regional malls once considered crown jewels of suburban retail. Namdar\u2019s willingness to buy where others won\u2019t \u2014 and insistence on prices only the most desperate sellers will accept \u2014 has become its signature move.\nBack east, the company has evolved into enormous leverage. This summer it locked in a $358 million financing package for two massive Jersey City projects, followed by\n$460 million from Scale Lending\nfor Florida multifamily developments. Those loans pushed Namdar\u2019s construction and redevelopment pipeline into the billions, cementing its transition from retail scavenger to full-spectrum builder and turnaround player.\nBut wherever Namdar goes,\nfriction tends to follow\n. The firm\u2019s aggressive style has sparked repeated legal fights and political backlash. Cities from Bloomingdale in Chicagoland to suburban New York jurisdictions have accused Namdar affiliates of neglecting retail assets, while the company touts new investments and partnerships. For every big closing, there\u2019s usually a courtroom battle not far behind.\nIgal Namdar didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\nStill, in a market paralyzed by high interest rates, dwindling numbers of equity partners and lender anxiety, few players are making moves at Namdar\u2019s scale and pace. The firm\u2019s website as of Friday claimed it owns 376 properties totaling nearly 79 million square feet across 37 states.\nWhether it\u2019s opportunism or overreach depends on who you ask \u2014 and only time will tell.\nAs the firm buys, borrows and brawls coast to coast, one thing is clear in any case: in 2025\u2019s high-stakes real estate landscape, the house of Namdar is playing every hand it can get.\n",

        "content": "You won\u2019t hear a lot about office woes in Orange County, but nowhere is perfect.\nThe commercial mortgage-backed securities debt connected to an office park located in Westminster went to special servicing after the borrower defaulted on about $16 million debt after eight months of delinquency, according to Morningstar Credit and Trepp.\nThe three-building, mid-rise, office campus at 5405, 5455 and 5555 Garden Grove Boulevard, with a total of 150,000 square feet, is owned by Younan Properties, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The property is worth $28 million, or $187 per square foot, according to a pre-pandemic appraisal, although keeping tenants has been an issue: The campus was 98 percent full at underwriting, but had fallen to 64 percent by June 2024, per the latest available data.\nThe special servicer notified the borrower but had not received a response as of October, according to servicer commentary via Morningstar.\nLeases over losses?\nHudson Pacific Properties\u2019 chairman and chief executive Victor Coleman can tout an office recovery all he wants, but the company is still\nbleeding money\n.\nThe Los Angeles-based real estate investment trust reported losses of $294 million in the nine months ended September 30 compared with $197 million a year earlier. The company mostly blamed the studio business, which is lagging throughout Los Angeles, for losses.\nColeman took the opportunity of the third-quarter earnings call to boast about technology and artificial intelligence companies and their need for office space in the Bay Area\u2014although he missed a chance to name-drop Elon Musk, whose company\nleased\n100,000 square feet at a Hudson Pacific office property in Palo Alto.\nIn all fairness, the company has inked 1.7 million square feet of leases in the nine months ending September, which it said is its best year-to-date leasing performance since before the pandemic. But office revenues are still declining and total occupancy is lower than 80 percent.\nIt remains to be seen whether the losses or leases will win out when it comes to Coleman\u2019s compensation. Last year, he raked in about $25 million worth\nof salary, stocks and bonuses\nwhile his company\u2019s losses ballooned to $364 million.\nEarnings elsewhere\nBy the numbers: Office-and-apartment REIT Douglas Emmett reported a net loss of $11 million in the third quarter compared to a $5 million profit a year earlier. Revenues were unchanged at $251 million.\nRetail developer and landlord Macerich reported a $87 million loss compared to $108 million loss the year before \u2014 and revenue increased to $253 million from $220 million.\nCommercial investor Kennedy Wilson reported a net loss of $21 million compared to $77 million during the same period, but revenues declined to $116 million from $127.5 million.\nA Lincoln buy\nLincoln Property Company\npurchased\na Manhattan Beach office building for $70 million to knock it down and replace it with apartments \u2014 and the seller, Continental Development Corporation, issued a $45 million note to make it happen.\nThe deal for the 123,000-square-foot property at 1500 Rosecrans Avenue came out to $569 per square foot.\nThe Beach Cities office sector, which encompasses Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach and Redondo Beach, has a 15 percent vacancy rate \u2014 much better than downtown Los Angeles\u2019 33.3 percent. But the average Manhattan Beach home value is $3 million and the average rent is $5,500 a month, so it seems Lincoln thought apartments were a better bang for its buck.\n",

        "content": "There are two types of people in Dallas real estate: those who think\ndowntown Dallas\npeaked in the twentieth century, and those who say the urban core\u2019s best days are ahead.\nFolks in the former camp point to the collapse of the\ncity\u2019s identity as an office destination\n, accelerated by the pandemic and made worse by public safety issues. Those on the opposite side urge the public to be patient and let the\n$3.7 billion convention center renovation\nproject do its magic and usher the city into a new era.\nOf course, for biggest cheerleaders in both of those groups, weighing in on the future of Dallas\u2019 downtown isn\u2019t just a matter of perspective; it\u2019s a bet with pretty high financial stakes.\nAs Pacific Elm\u2019s Jonas Woods points out, \u201cThere\u2019s a serious financial incentive to push tenants to more expensive buildings.\u201d\nSuburban office owners and tenant rep brokers both stand to gain when downtown tenants head elsewhere. Therefore, it pays to maintain the perception of downtown as dangerous and undesirable, he asserts.\nWoods, on the other hand, has bet his career on the transformative power of adaptive reuse for downtown Dallas, contending that the urban core has a future as a live-work-play destination if only the aging office stock can be reimagined.\nIt\u2019s not just theoretical for Woods, who\u2019s also AT&amp;T\u2019s landlord. The telecoms giant has been\ncontemplating a move to the suburbs\n, which could have troubling effects for its downtown home at Whitacre Tower, the 1.1 million-square-foot office behemoth at 208 South Akard Street.\nRegardless of who\u2019s right, it\u2019s undeniable that the downtown pessimists are persuasive. In addition to AT&amp;T, the Dallas Mavericks and Stars are similarly contemplating moves to the \u2018burbs as they run up against leases at American Airlines Center (which isn\u2019t technically downtown, but does a lot more for downtown than an arena in Plano would).\nCheck out this month\u2019s magazine for more on the factors affecting downtown\u2019s revival chances.\nHere\u2019s what else is going on in Texas real estate news:\nErwin Nicholas II is Mr. Real Estate. He made a name for himself as the\nluxury broker for the Houston glitterati\n\u2014 which typically requires the utmost discretion. Nicholas set off on an atypical path when he started marketing Spurs legend Tony Parker\u2019s Hill Country hacienda, tapping Twitch streamer Kat Cenat, who was looking for a place to host a 30-day \u201csubathon,\u201d to jolt the marketing of the property.\nSpeaking of the Spurs, the San Antonio basketball team was on the ballot this election and won. Alamo City voters approved two constitutional amendments to\nprovide funding for Project Marvel\n, the $4 billion plan for a downtown entertainment district that includes a new arena for the team. Voters approved $311 million in venue tax for the arena and $192 million for a new stock show and rodeo district.\nFile this under unexpected election day results:\nDemocrat Taylor Rehmet\nwon the majority of the vote in the Texas Senate District 9 race, a district President Donald Trump won handily in 2024. The district includes wealthy Fort Worth suburbs Southlake and Keller. Rehmet is likely headed to a runoff with runner-up Republican Leigh Wambsganss. The rub? Casino magnate, Mavs owner and major Republican donor Miriam Adelson was dumping cash into the race in support of pro-casino candidate Republican John Huffman. Huffman\u2019s loss to Wambsganss, who has firmly opposed any expansion of casino gambling, leaves Democrat Rehmet as Adelson\u2019s only option when it comes to her hopes for extending her Las Vegas-based gambling empire into DFW.\nAlmost\n$600 million\nworth of commercial real estate loans tied to properties in Texas headed to foreclosure auction on Tuesday. Houston has been hardest hit, month after month, and November was no different. July Residential\u2019s five-property multifamily portfolio was scheduled for sale after the firm allegedly defaulted on an $81.5 million mortgage from Voya.\n",

        "content": "For agents assisting clients in the burn zones, the\npast 10 months\nhave stretched patience levels and service skills to the limit.\nOutside of the regular role of helping clients find homes, they\u2019ve done so amid a backdrop of inventory shortages, regulatory changes, insurance challenges, low-ball offers from spec developers, pushes to have the city of Los Angeles pause the Measure United to House L.A. tax and dispelling misinformation.\n\u201cThere was a lot of shady stuff happening,\u201d Westside Estate Agency JJ Meyers recalled of the price gouging and vultures looking to take advantage of the situation in the months immediately following the Palisades and Eaton fires.\nHe, like others, credited brokerage leadership for providing the operational support to navigate a constantly shifting environment.\n\u201cClosure is the name of the name,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cIt\u2019s so strange. I can\u2019t really put it into words. I think that I\u2019m still processing a lot of it. For the last 10 months, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve taken more than two days off because every day, I get a call there\u2019s just constantly something and it\u2019s terrible. My focus is \u2018How do I make sure this next version of the Palisades or Pasadena or Altadena is not a better version of itself, but the best version of what it was and protecting that.\u2019\u201d\nThe Real Deal\nchecked in with several players in the fire recovery for the November issue of our magazine, which is rapidly approaching its one-year anniversary. From agents and architects to developers and investors, new stories are emerging.\n\u201cI think what people don\u2019t realize is how many people are back in the areas, like half of the Huntington [Palisades neighborhood],\u201d said Carolwood Estates\u2019 Nichole Shanfeld. \u201cThere are a lot of people back and choosing to go back willingly\u2026. We need to eliminate this fear of being a dead town. It would be helpful for people to know their neighbors are back.\u201d\nReal estate buys into Estate Media\nCount\nEstate Media\nas a contender in the real estate media landscape.\nThe content platform started by Compass\u2019 Josh Flagg, CEO Griff O\u2019Brien and Carolwood LP principal Andrew Shanfeld announced $1 million in seed funding.\nThe round attracted a who\u2019s who of real estate, with investors that include Compass\u2019 Tracy Tutor, Chad Carroll in Miami and the Hudson Advisory team of New York. George Laughton of My Home Group in Arizona also invested.\nEstate Media\u2019s stated ambition is to produce everything from original shows for various social media channels to trade-focused educational programs.\nFrom a business standpoint, Estate Media \u2013 now two years old \u2013 turned profitable in the current quarter. It\u2019s generated $6 million in revenue to date and is set to see 2026 revenue reach eight figures, according to O\u2019Brien.\nHollywood studio with history gets listed\nKenneth \u201cBabyface\u201d Edmonds\njust dropped a big slice of music history on the market in Hollywood.\nThe award-winning producer and singer-songwriter is asking just under $7 million for a two-level studio space at 751 North Highland Avenue. The upstairs, originally designed by Edmonds to be a meditation retreat, functions as a temporary residence with a full bath\nfor the artists that have worked out of that space.\nIt\u2019s a long list of big industry names that have come through the space, including Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Whitney Houston, Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Mariah Carey, Barbra Streisand and Pharrell Williams.\nRob Lowe lands buyer in Beverly Hills\nAfter more than a year on the market, different listing agents and price cuts,\nRob Lowe\nand his wife, Sheryl Berkoff, sold their Beverly Hills home at the top of Franklin Canyon.\nThe couple traded the three-bed, five-bath home for $4 million, or $1,347 per square foot. They originally listed it last July for $6.6 million.\nKeller Williams Realty Los Feliz\u2019s Lori Harris and Brock Harris, along with Carolwood Estates\u2019 Shana Tavangarian represented the sellers. Meanwhile, Nourmand &amp; Associates\u2019 Rochelle Maize represented the mystery buyer.\n",

        "content": "Will the only congressional district entirely within the City of San Francisco go from power player to policy wonk?\nThat will be the case if State Senator Scott Wiener\u2013perhaps the most effective legislator of the past generation on reshaping the state\u2019s housing policy\u2013has his way.\nPower player Nancy Pelosi threw the door open on the 11th District seat she has held since the 1980s, a decision that came after years of speculation over her future, and amid growing discontent over the median age in Congress, and fresh signs of generational upheaval in political leadership.\nThe pending exit by Pelosi\u2013the first woman to serve as Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, and a two-time holder of that gavel\u2013may have been expected. Wiener threw his hat in the ring last month, weeks before Pelosi\u2019s plans were clear, and her official announcement now clears the biggest hurdle from Wiener\u2019s path.\nWiener\u2019s impact stretches\nfrom putting teeth in the state\u2019s local housing mandates\nin 2017, to successfully leading a bill signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom last month to\nupzone property along transit lines\nin the state\u2019s most populous counties.\nWiener told CBS this week that, among other priorities in healthcare and energy, he wants to get the federal government back into helping to solve the nation\u2019s housing crisis \u2014 a similar mission he carried at the state level in Sacramento.\nThe state senator is so far up against Saikat Chakrabarti, a self-funded progressive candidate who has been campaigning for months. Chakrabarti\u2019s bid picks up some significant cachet owing to his prior service as chief of staff to U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New Yorker who has become a leading next-generation progressive with the Democratic Party.\nOne of Wiener\u2019s marquee accomplishments in his state legislative tenure was to require cities and counties throughout California to permit significantly more housing construction. In San Francisco, that state is requiring the city to make room for 82,000 new housing units by 2031. To accomplish that, local lawmakers are mulling a plan to upzone neighborhoods across the city.\nIntroduced by Mayor Daniel Lurie,\nthe Family Zoning Plan\nis slowly making its way through the approval process. However, as talk about upzoning grows, so, too, do displacement fears. In response, the San Francisco Planning Commission on Thursday\nunanimously supported reinforced tenant protections\nand new restrictions on housing demolitions as a way to preserve existing levels of affordable and rent controlled housing throughout the city.\nThe effort is classically San Franciscan, with local lawmakers taking existing state law and turning\nit up a few notches. For instance, the state\u2019s Housing Crisis Act of 2019 requires property owners who demolish affordable or rent protected units to replace them with the same number of bedrooms. If this new round of tenant and demolition protections pass for San Francisco, not only will the replacement units need the same number of bedrooms, as state law requires, they will also need the same number of full bathrooms and 90 percent of the original square footage.\n",

        "content": "New York City\u2019s Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani was on the minds of Miami developers, brokers and billionaires last week.\nHis win on Tuesday has fueled a number of memes and social media posts claiming that a mass exodus of wealthy New Yorkers to Florida is already underway. He\u2019s promised to freeze rents on rent-stabilized buildings and increase corporate and income taxes.\nAt\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s Miami Real Estate Forum, held on Wednesday and Thursday, Mamdani was at the center of many conversations. While he disagrees with Mamdani\u2019s politics, hospitality mogul Sam Nazarian said his campaign \u201chit a chord for the next generation.\u201d\nDeveloper Kevin Maloney joked that he contributed to Mamdani\u2019s campaign. The joke is that his win will benefit Maloney and other developers in two ways: driving down the price of real estate in New York City and propelling more ultra-high net worth individuals to Florida, where Maloney has a number of projects underway. \u201cMamdani, I think, is probably going to end the city,\u201d he\nsaid on a panel\nwith developers Bruce Eichner and Carlos Rosso.\nBut most speakers were a bit more skeptical. Mamdani\u2019s election is prompting New Yorkers who were already considering a move, they said.\nDevelopers Ugo Colombo, Camilo Miguel Jr. and Edgardo Defortuna, and broker Craig Studnicky all said the expected influx of New Yorkers will fall short of that seen during and immediately after the pandemic.\nAgents said they\u2019re receiving calls post-election, but \u201cmost of them were people venting,\u201d Danny Hertzberg said. And contracts are\nstill being signed in New York\n, residential agents in the city told my colleagues in New York. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear any more nonsense from Florida brokers,\u201d said Serhant\u2019s Ravi Kantha.\nThe political divide between more liberal cities like New York and Miami was on full display at another big conference last week, where President Trump, developer Steve Witkoff (now United States Special Envoy to the Middle East), billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Jamie Dimon and others spoke.\nGriffin relocated his multibillion-dollar hedge fund Citadel to Miami from Chicago in 2022, driven by politics and a lack of state income tax in Florida.\nGriffin has spent and plans to invest billions of dollars in South Florida. On Friday, the hedge funder announced a $20 million gift to Vizcaya Museum and Gardens and the relocation of a historic house on his waterfront Miami property to Vizcaya. Also last week, Griffin announced a $5 million gift to Lotus House, the biggest women\u2019s homeless shelter, which opened a new 70,000-square-foot campus in Miami\u2019s Overtown.\nInterviewed by Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier, Griffin said he prays that Mamdani implements policies that are \u201cdifferent than the talking points he used to win the mayoral race.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived in a failed city state. I lived in Chicago for 30 some years. I have two colleagues who had bullets fly through cars and a colleague stabbed outside the front door of her office,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cI really hope that when Mamdani thinks about leadership, he thinks about the right role models. And there\u2019s a lot to copy from our great state of Florida and from this great city of Miami.\u201d\nGriffin plans a nearly $2 billion headquarters for Citadel and Citadel Securities in Miami. In New York, Griffin, Vornado Realty Trust and Rudin are also building a 1.7 million-square-foot tower at 350 Park Avenue, which will be anchored by Citadel and Citadel Securities.\nWitkoff told Baier that he tells his son, Witkoff CEO Alex Witkoff, to not sell any real estate.\n\u201cWe have a lot in Florida. We\u2019ve got a big, deep, long bet on Florida, for all the obvious reasons,\u201d Witkoff said. \u201cThe only downside to Florida people can think of is hurricanes.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nIf you have buyers who said they are leaving New York specifically because of Mamdani, send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential:\nTodd and Brandie Herbst sold the single-family home at 167 Everglade Avenue in Palm Beach for just over $21 million \u2014 about $500,000 over the asking price \u2014 to Everglade167 LLC. Todd Herbst co-founded Big Time Restaurant Group in 1993.\nCommercial:\nIn Palm Beach Gardens, Aventura-based Advenir offloaded an apartment complex at\n4120 Union Square Boulevard\n, known as the Palm Beach Gardens Apartments, for $117.9 million. An LLC tied to Boston-based West Shore purchased the property.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nAn oceanfront estate in Palm Beach hit the market for $185 million. The late real estate developer Murray Goodman and his wife, Joanie Goodman, owned the 2.2-acre property at 911 North Ocean Boulevard. It\u2019s on the market with their daughter, Illustrated Properties agent Marley Overman. The property has 250 feet of frontage along the Atlantic Ocean and a nearly 24,000-square-foot multi-structure estate with 12 bedrooms, 16 full bathrooms and four half-bathrooms, according to the listing. It\u2019s being marketed as a teardown.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nFlorida is one of the hardest hit states by the federal government shutdown. About 95,000 federal workers in the Sunshine State have lost an average of $10,363 each, according to the\nTallahassee Democrat\n.\nElsewhere in Florida\nRoughly 268,000 Venezuelans in the U.S. lost their Temporary Protected Status on Friday, stripping them of legal status and work authorization and leaving them vulnerable to deportation, the\nMiami Herald\nreports.\nStarting on Friday, the government shutdown led to more than 110 flight cancellations and nearly 600 delays across major Florida airports, including Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, Miami and Tampa, the\nPalm Beach Post\nreports.\nBillionaire developer Jorge P\u00e9rez and other investors plan to replace a crucial 700,000-barrel fuel depot on Fisher Island with luxury condo towers, sparking concern from Miami-Dade officials about the effect on the port and local economy, according to\nBloomberg\n. County commissioner Raquel Regalado called it an \u201cexistential crisis.\u201d",

        "content": "October was a stellar month for the Chicago area\u2019s lakefront getaways.\nA string of\nhigh-end sales in Lake Geneva\nput the fight for scant inventory on full display, while North Shore towns hosted some standout deals, continuing the run of luxury real estate in Chicagoland.\nFresh off the heels of making the biggest single-home resale deal in Chicagoland\u2019s history in August, Jena Radnay of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate landed the second-priciest home sale of the year with a\n$14.5 million Kenilworth estate\n.\nThe 8,300-square-foot lakefront mansion was the most expensive home to sell in\nKenilworth\nin the 2020s. The six-bedroom, 10 bathroom home at 219 Sheridan Road was sold by designer Yoanna Kulas, and the buyers have not been identified.\nRadnay\n, who has sold some of the most expensive homes in the region this year along an elite stretch of\nSheridan Road\nin the North Shore suburbs, represented both the buyer and the seller.\nNorth Shore homes have been\nrecording eye-popping sales all year\n, leading the way in the area\u2019s luxury home sales. But lakefront houses in the Wisconsin resort town of Lake Geneva had a great run in October as well.\nLake Geneva lakefront lands $10.3M deal\nIn one of the highest-dollar sales on Geneva Lake this year, a lakefront home on Lake Shore Drive a short walk from downtown Lake Geneva sold for $10.3 million last month.\nThe 7,900-square-foot house sold for close to $500,000 above the asking price, a 5 percent premium. Listing agent Bob Webster of Compass, who represented the buyer and seller, said the seller received five offers on the house, and it went under contract within three days.\nOctober was a standout month for Lake Geneva\u2019s upper-end market. Three more sales of $7 million or more closed there last month. Two other lakefront houses, priced at $6 million and $7.4 million, went under contract in October.\nLakefront listings in Lake Geneva are going fast, often getting contracts after just a few days on the market. Webster, who also sold an $8.7 million listing in the Wisconsin resort town last month, said there is likely to be more selling activity in the upper market this year.\nLake Forest mansion scratches top of market\nTo kick off the month, a mansion in Lake Forest sold for the highest price in three years in an $11 million deal.\nThe\n11,800-square-foot house\nfeatured a glass-paned indoor conservatory, ornate landscaping and elaborate gardens. It was listed in August 2024 at nearly $15 million. Ann Lyon with @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate had the listing, and @properties\u2019 Amanda McMillan represented the buyer.\nThe mansion housed a long lineage of Chicago business leaders. It was built in 1912 for John T Pirie, president of Carson Pirie Scott &amp; Company, a dry goods and department store company. It was later owned by Laurance Armour Jr., part of the Armour meat packing family who was the vice chairman of the board at LaSalle Bank.\nThe house was sold by the estate of Posy Krehbiel, the ex-wife of John Krehbiel Jr., who she bought the property with in 1988. John Krehbiel Jr. was the co-chairman of electronics company Molex, which Koch Industries bought in 2013.\nOak Brook home brings in $5.3 million\nThe only house in the western suburbs to crack $5 million last month was a secluded\nOak Brook mansion\nin a gated community surrounded by green space.\nA 10,000-square-foot home on Fox Trail Court sold for $5.3 million, the highest price achieved in that suburb since 2009. The one-acre property is in the gated Hunter Trails community, which sits between forest preserves, country clubs and a spacious park.\nThe home generated more interest than usual for a listing of its price, listing agent Michael Lafido said. It received multiple offers and sold for $105,000 over asking.\nOnly a few other homes in the western suburbs have brought in higher sales prices this year. Hinsdale has been the site of three sales over $5.5 million this year, and a Barrington house featured in the Fox TV series \u201cEmpire\u201d sold for $6.5 million after spending more than a decade on the market and cutting its asking price by more than half.\nKenilworth home sets inland record\nIt\u2019s not just lakefront properties that are setting impressive records. In Kenilworth, a house off the lake\nsold Oct. 10 for $6.1 million\n, a likely record for an off-lake house in the village.\nFrom the outside, the house appears similar to its original 1896 neoclassical design. But the interior has been gutted and renovated with an open floor plan and modern finishes. The extensive interior work and expansion of the back of the house was led by the sellers, Stephan and Janet Scholl, who bought the property in 2021. It has six bedrooms and seven bathrooms, along with a detached three-car garage that includes an office.\nThe house, on Kenilworth Avenue, is a short walk from the Lake Michigan shoreline. John Mawicke of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate represented the seller and buyer.\n",

Luxury is appreciating faster than non-luxury, possibly due to lending trends that don\u2019t affect cash buyers, but luxury sales are near the lowest levels on record for Redfin.\nAustin has gone through some of the most radical market changes in the state, booming in 2020 and 2021 before contracting to a\nbuyer\u2019s market\nthis year.\nFor Austinites looking for a sure thing, Victorians or mid-century moderns \u201care definitely more of a premium,\u201d Waldmann said.\n\u201cYou can buy a\nnew construction home\nbuilt in the last three years at any point in the market. But if that home that\u2019s been around for a hundred years finally hits the market, and this is your one chance before it switches ownership for another 30 years, you\u2019re more likely to swing the bat,\u201d Waldmann said.\nNon-historic luxury homes rise and fall more with the market, according to Robert Searcy, a Houston agent who specializes in historic and architecturally significant properties.\n\u201cGood markets, bad markets, supply and demand has always got to rule the day, and there\u2019s always got to be an audience for the more historically significant houses, the more architecturally interesting houses,\u201d Searcy said.\nOwing to a generally steady flow of businesses moving to Dallas, North Texas\u2019 luxury market hasn\u2019t sagged as much as Austin\u2019s. However, luxury sales have still declined 4 percent year over year in Dallas, according to Redfin.\nAllie Beth Allman agent Michael Humphries said historic luxury inventory can \u201cmaintain value,\u201d but it generally trails new builds.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of times when the dirt outweighs what the value is worth to redo it, and it makes more sense to tear them down. That\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing a lot of in these areas,\u201d Humphries said, mentioning Preston Hollow, Park Cities and the M Streets.\nDallas \u201ctakes the cake\u201d on historic teardowns, according to Humphries.\n\u201cThere\u2019s more wealth here in Dallas than there is in other major markets in Texas,\u201d Humphries said.\nMary Alice Garrison, another Allie Beth Allman agent who often sells in Dallas historic districts, said Victorian or architecturally significant homes without historic protection are frequently razed in desirable neighborhoods like Highland Park.\n\u201cHighland Park is kind of notorious for that,\u201d Garrison said.\n",

Gindi transferred the deed to an LLC two weeks before selling the shares in the corporation to Hakim, according to property records. The home was built in 2006, according to Curbed.\nThe sale price surpasses the borough\u2019s previous record for a single-family sale, set by 8 Montague Terrace in Brooklyn Heights, which sold for $25.5 million in 2020.\nThe family that made its fortune founding the discount department store Century 21 in the 1960s moved past retail and into real estate, accumulating a vast portfolio under Gindi Capital across Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens that it sold for $164 million in 2012.\nThe family has remained active in the city, currently working with Legion Investment Group on a\nluxury condo offering at 38 Gramercy Park North\n. Legion and Gindi closed on the final two properties in a six-parcel assemblage earlier this year.\nElsewhere in the city, Gindi is\nfacing foreclosure with another prominent South Brooklyn\nresident and Wharton Properties founder, Jeff Sutton.

        "content": "Miami\u2019s status as a top destination for real estate developers, brokers, foreign investors and New Yorkers was on full display at\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s Miami Real Estate Forum last week.\nThe two-day conference attracted thousands of attendees and dozens of developers, brokers, lenders, architects and other vendors who featured their products and projects at the showcase component. Espresso and champagne flowed, and new development merchandise was offered at elaborately built-out booths. The event was held at Mana Wynwood on Nov. 5 and 6.\nDespite challenges that include a difficult and time-consuming permitting process, high interest rates and more, speakers were bullish on the region. They pushed back on negative views.\nHere are some of the biggest takeaways:\nIn a one-on-one with\nTRD\nPublisher Amir Korangy, multifamily investor\nPatrick Carroll reflected\non his past controversies and his diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Carroll said he plans to re-enter the real estate game in 2027 once his noncompete agreement expires, and he projected $500 million to $1 billion in acquisitions.\nOn a separate panel,\nmultifamily developers\nBruce Menin, Erik Rutter and Joe Lubeck said that South Florida is \u201creally not overbuilt.\u201d Demand is high, especially for high-end apartments. Even though debt markets are robust, the true issue for South Florida\u2019s multifamily market is skittish equity, the panelists said, again arguing that only top sponsors and projects in premier neighborhoods can get investment.\nThe lack of affordable housing came up a few times. That\u2019s pushing local residents toward other growing Florida markets such as Orlando,\nsaid developer Dan Kodsi\non a panel about how developers can survive the market crunch in Miami. Market analyst Ana Bozovic pushed back on the theory of a Miami bubble, arguing that the market is \u201cbuilt on cash\u201d and not subject to a debt-fueled collapse like in 2008. Kodsi and Two Roads Development\u2019s Brad Meltzer both addressed separate projects tied up in litigation \u2014 Kodsi\u2019s Legacy Hotel &amp; Residences and Two Roads\u2019 planned Edition Residences \u2014 and said they would ultimately be resolved and built.\nWhile domestic buyers now outpace foreign buyers,\ninternational investors\nare still very active, especially those from countries like Mexico, Brazil and Colombia, said panelists Edgardo Defortuna and Craig Studnicky on a panel about foreign investment.\nOn the\noffice front\n, experts said the market is still driven by new-to-market tenants from states such as New York and California. New, boutique office projects are commanding record-high rents, such as The Fifth Miami Beach reaching $180 per square foot to $240 per square foot. Still, institutional owners are seeking exit strategies for older office buildings, with \u201cpretty much zero institutional capital chasing office,\u201d said David Moret, founder of Highline Real Estate Capital.\nDevelopers\nUgo Colombo and Camilo Miguel Jr.\nwere among the speakers who anticipate a new wave of New Yorkers moving to South Florida following Zohran Mamdani\u2019s mayoral election win, though they don\u2019t expect it to match the scale of the pandemic-era influx. The developers are dealing with headwinds like market softening in non-luxury sectors and high construction costs, but the luxury condo market remains strong, they said.\nThe strong luxury market\ndominated a panel\ncentered around luxury home design in South Florida and Naples. These buyers are increasingly demanding and seeking all-in-one primary homes with extravagant amenities.\nIt also spilled over into a conversation with brokers Margit Brandt, Danny Hertzberg and Dawn McKenna, who shared their journeys to\nachieving $100M deals\nin the luxury real estate market and how they were well-positioned for the pandemic-triggered boom in their respective markets: Miami, Palm Beach and Naples.\n",

        "content": "Zurich North America is trading in its downtown Chicago digs for a smaller, more prestigious address in the sky.\nThe insurer signed a 52,000-square-foot lease at Willis Tower, cutting its Chicago office space by more than two-thirds as it prepares to vacate\n300 South Riverside Plaza\n, a West Loop property already battling financial trouble.\nThe move will relocate the tenant\u2019s Chicago workspace to the 53rd and 54th floors of Blackstone\u2019s Willis Tower next year. Todd Mintz with JLL represented Zurich North America in the deal, while Nikki Kern with The Telos Group represented Blackstone portfolio company Perform Properties.\nIt\u2019s a stark drop from the roughly 107,000 square feet Zurich leased at 300 South Riverside over the last 12 years, signaling how even deep-pocketed tenants are recalibrating real estate requirements in the hybrid work era.\nZurich\u2019s exit delivers another blow to 300 South Riverside\u2019s owner, a venture of investors David Werner and Joseph Mizrachi that has struggled with a complicated debt structure on the property. While they own the 23-story building, they\u2019re also encumbered by a 99-year ground lease, paying rent to land ownership that includes well-known New York investor\nRubin Schron\n.\nPlus, in 2023, they triggered a loan default on a $175 million deal that has been tricky to resolve, and have also had\nmajor tenants leave\nor cut back on their leases.\nZurich\u2019s move, while bad news for its old landlord, is a win for\nBlackstone\u2019s Willis Tower\n, which has managed to stay at the top of the market through an expensive overhaul and difficult loan extension negotiations this year.\nAfter a $500 million renovation completed in 2022, the 110-story skyscraper has consistently drawn blue-chip tenants and new capital. But whether the property is underwater on its 10-figure mortgage depends on who you ask.\nBlackstone this year received a\nsecond valuation for the building that added $370 million\nto the $1 billion appraisal it notched during its loan modification this year.\nThe extra value is derived from the Skydeck revenue, a unique source of tourist-driven income that fluctuates seasonally and depends heavily on consumer spending patterns. But without accounting for the Skydeck\u2019s contributions, the building\u2019s debt of $1.3 billion, now due in 2028, would well outweigh the real estate value.\nZurich\u2019s relocation reinforces just how uneven the recovery is.\nOffice occupancy in downtown Chicago hovered at a record low of 72 percent last quarter, and leasing is being driven almost exclusively by tenants trading up to premium, amenity-heavy buildings.\nZurich\u2019s shift mirrors recent moves by law firm\nArentFox Schiff\n, which also shrank its Willis Tower lease, and by companies like\nCars.com\n, which trimmed its space in 300 South Riverside by two-thirds to 53,000 square feet, to match hybrid work patterns.\nMeanwhile, office buildings outside the very top tier of quality are struggling with vacancy and distress.\nZurich, whose North American headquarters will stay in Schaumburg, framed the move as a long-term commitment to Chicago and its workforce. But the subtext is clear: companies want less space and more quality. That trend is leaving landlords of aging properties scrambling to hold onto tenants and make peace with lenders.\nThe move follows\nZurich\u2019s $20 million settlement\nearlier this year with Schaumburg over a dispute tied to tax incentive payouts at its 783,800-square-foot suburban headquarters.\nThe village had withheld funds over remote-work requirements, but the deal, which reduced Zurich\u2019s maximum TIF reimbursement to $80 million from $100 million, ended a three-year standoff and set clearer rules for future payouts. The resolution comes as suburban office vacancies are above 30 percent, reflecting the same post-pandemic reckoning that\u2019s driving Zurich\u2019s leaner downtown presence.\n",

        "content": "It was a notorious \u201c\nhe said\n,\nshe said\n.\u201d Now, a court has laid down its version of events in the legal dispute among former leaders at a former multifamily giant.\nFairstead launched in 2014 and grew to one of the country\u2019s largest apartment landlords. By 2022, it had\n$7.8 billion in assets\nand projects in the pipeline and 24,000 housing units across 28 states with ambitions to grow even bigger.\nBut recent years have seen the firm caught up in internal disputes, landing in court and sparking multiple trials.\nIn 2016, an employee named John Tatum III joined the firm to build up a division centered on low-income housing tax credits. When that branch of the business \u201cboomed,\u201d according to the recent decision, Tatum sought more equity in that line of the business, alongside Fairstead co-founder William Blodgett, who had recruited him. Their ask kicked off a blowup. Goldberg, Blodgett, Tatum and Fairstead\u2019s previously little-known backer, billionaire hedge funder Stuart Feldman, ended up in court.\nLike many opaque business disputes, this one gained clarity in the Delaware Court of Chancery. In late October, a judge sided with Tatum, publishing a 100-page opinion that went largely in his favor.\nThe trial, which involved 10 witnesses and nearly 2,600 exhibits, doesn\u2019t just provide a play-by-play of the drama and negotiation at Fairstead. The judge, Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster, also implied he would stand by the facts laid out in Tatum\u2019s decision when he dives into another case based on the same events: one brought by former Fairstead partner\nBlodgett,\nwhich will begin early next year.\nLaster\u2019s opinion determined the value of Tatum\u2019s equity in a Fairstead fund at $7.8 million, which will bear on Blodgett\u2019s case.\nA \u201cgolden goose\u201d\nThe judge paints a picture of competing personalities, egos and visions at Fairstead.\nInstead of \u201cOnce upon a time,\u201d Laster begins: \u201cA hedge fund manager with capital, an attorney with legal savvy, and an entrepreneur with energy and vision formed a fund complex that invested in affordable housing projects.\u201d\nThat trio are\u00a0Feldman, Goldberg and Blodgett, respectively.\nAs the judge tells it, the firm\u2019s affordable arm had been mostly in rent-stabilized stock when Tatum joined. Tatum grew Fairstead Affordable by doing low-income tax credit deals. Between 2017 and 2022, the business completed deals with developer fees of $181 million.\n\u201cBlodgett and Tatum came to believe that they had created significant value (they had) and deserved a substantial, even controlling equity stake in the business,\u201d Laster wrote.\nTatum was only entitled to 5.25 percent of the business he was building, while Feldman and Goldberg indirectly controlled the lion\u2019s share. (Blodgett had a 9.71 percent interest through an LLC that controlled Fairstead Affordable.) Tatum and Blodgett pushed for restructuring at Fairstead and a bigger piece of the pie. Both felt they also needed to offer equity to employees. Goldberg encouraged them to come up with a proposal.\nIn the summer of 2020, the pair retained a law firm to advise them on restructuring, but also on a plan B: a new company. Blodgett, who had married into the influential Tisch family, began meeting with other funders, including the offices of his extended family.\nIn early 2021, Tatum and Blodgett got a proposal from Goldberg about equity, but it involved a long-term incentive plan that made their restructuring seem unlikely.\nBlodgett\u2019s thought process is legible through notes he made to himself at the time. He considered himself the firm\u2019s \u201cgolden goose,\u201d he wrote, \u201cleveraging my name, my family\u2019s name, my relationships,\u201d while \u201cgetting NOTHING in return. NOTHING.\u201d\nHe edged closer to a decision.\n\u201cI\u2019m 38 years old,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe time is now.\u201d\nYet still hopeful about a restructuring, Blodgett presented a proposal to Goldberg: He would replace the attorney as CEO, with Tatum as COO. Goldberg dismissed it out of hand.\n\u201cRestarting is a reality,\u201d Tatum texted Blodgett after.\nAs they became more serious about leaving to start a new company, Blodgett began to share confidential Fairstead information with two separate family offices, that of the Tisches and of his father-in-law, hedge funder\nDonald Sussman\n.\nTo Feldman, he proposed a plan to give himself 40 percent of the equity and a path to full control in a decade.\n\u201cEveryone is here because of me. But they realize that I have no power. No control,\u201d Blodgett told Feldman. \u201cEveryone says it\u2019s my company.\u201d Tatum had earlier made a similar statement to Goldberg: \u201cI will not sell a dream I know nothing about and have no control over,\u201d he said in April of 2020.\nUltimately, no ideas for a new structure were approved.\nWith employees beginning to eye the exit and whispers of a new venture, Goldberg proposed a transition plan. But in September 2021, Fairstead\u2019s IT department intercepted an email to Blodgett: an invoice from the law firm he retained, about the new company.\nFeldman tried to squeeze Blodgett, terminating him for cause and canceling all his equity. Tatum resigned shortly after but continued to work for a 120-day notice period and \u201cthought he left on good terms.\u201d Blodgett started a competing venture, Tredway. Following his notice period, Tatum ultimately did not go to work for him.\nAfter Tatum left, Fairstead offered Tatum a lowball number for his equity. When Tatum rejected it, Fairstead retroactively terminated him for cause and declared his equity forfeited. Tatum sued the company. But, in a panic following the original restructuring meeting, Tatum had downloaded thousands of documents, both personal and confidential. Though he later returned most of the confidential documents, Fairstead countersued, arguing Tatum breached his employment contract and his fiduciary duty.\n\u201cNot credible\u201d\nMichael Carlinsky, an attorney with Quinn Emanuel for Fairstead, declined to comment on behalf of the company.\nThe judge rejected several points from Feldman and Goldberg\u2019s accounts.\nGoldberg at trial denied knowing that Tatum and Blodgett wanted substantial ownership and control. He also denied encouraging them to come up with a restructuring proposal and telling them that he was working on a plan to get them more equity.\nFeldman denied discussing a joint venture with Blodgett.\n\u201cThe contemporaneous documents show that Goldberg both knew what Blodgett and Tatum wanted and was trying to steer them toward possibilities that Feldman might find acceptable,\u201d Laster wrote.\nUltimately, in the case of Tatum, the court found that Goldberg and Feldman\u2019s behavior around his departure, including cancelling Tatum\u2019s equity interests, was in bad faith. Tatum was awarded the value of his 5.25 percent equity. The judge sided with Tatum\u2019s appraiser as to that value, rather than with Fairstead\u2019s. That put the award at about $7.8 million. With a percentage of the promote on two sales, damages will be nearly $10 million, before interest.\nThe judge also largely rejected Fairstead\u2019s claims of breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty, although he agreed that Tatum breached his employment contract by downloading company documents.\nFairstead was awarded the cost of investigating that breach, about $155,000.\nIn a statement, Tatum said he was still proud of what the team built at Fairstead and the partners that made it possible.\n\u201cWhat followed my exit was an orchestrated attempt by Fairstead to erase that legacy by assaulting my character, burying me in litigation, and taking what was rightfully mine,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe court\u2019s thorough decision sets the record straight.\u201d\nTatum\u2019s legal team included his wife, Sara Shaw Tatum, a litigator and former Supreme Court clerk.\nBlodgett\u2019s lawyers at Susman Godfrey declined to comment about their client\u2019s case, and it is unclear whether he would fare similarly to Tatum. In January, a different Delaware decision determined that Fairstead didn\u2019t have the right to take Blodgett\u2019s equity. In April, an arbitrator\nfound Blodgett had misused\nFairstead\u2019s proprietary information and enlisted other employees in a plan to take control of the company. Because that relates to Blodgett\u2019s employment contract, not his operating agreement, it does not imply that Blodgett\u2019s entire interests would be canceled, according to the judge.\nIn 2022, when it had a $6 billion portfolio and 16,500 units,\nGoldberg\ntold\nThe Real Deal\nthat it was aiming to have 50,000 units by 2027. Asked then about Blodgett\u2019s departure, Goldberg said: \u201cI think in some ways change is good.\u201d\n",

Houston has taken steps to demolish unsafe and vacant properties, including a few Midtown buildings slated for teardown ahead of the\n2026 FIFA World Cup\n.\nOther efforts focus on mitigation rather than demolition.

        "content": "Manhattan\u2019s luxury market is booming despite fears that Zohran Mamdani\u2019s victory would push wealthy New Yorkers out of the city.\nBuyers signed contracts for 41 homes asking $4 million or more last week, according to Olshan Realty\u2019s weekly report. Twenty-four of those deals were inked after Tuesday night, when the results of the mayoral election were\ncalled in favor of\nthe 34-year-old Assembly member from Queens.\nLast week marked the first time 40 or more contracts were signed for luxury properties since late May. The number of pending deals was also up from the\nprevious period\u2019s\ntotal of 37.\nIn the weeks before the polls closed, headlines claimed a mass exodus of the city\u2019s richest residents, largely citing agents from nearby suburban markets and South Florida. However, warnings of a flight are\nlikely overblown\n, as several agents pointed out to\nThe Real Deal\nlast week, with some pointing to contract reports showing a market busy with high-priced deals.\nThe most expensive home to enter contract was a penthouse at\n15 Hudson Yards\n, with an asking price just under $23 million. The 5,100-square-foot duplex initially asked $30 million when it was marketed off floor plans in 2016.\nUnit PH88D has four bedrooms and seven bathrooms. It also features 26-foot-high ceilings, a double-sided fireplace and views of the Hudson River.\nAmenities at the 285-unit building, developed by Related Companies and Oxford Property Group, include a fitness center, pool, ballroom and residents\u2019 lounge.\nCorcoran\u2019s Hottinger Team and Arsic Lau Team had the listing.\nThe second priciest property to land a buyer was a unit at the Flatiron Building conversion, asking $19.4 million. Unit 3North is the first at the much-hyped project to show up in weekly contract reports, though Corcoran\u2019s Steve Gold hinted at a\nforthcoming deal\non Instagram last month, when he claimed to have represented the first buyer to sign a contract at the building.\nThe 4,800-square-foot condo has three bedrooms, four bathrooms and a great room overlooking Madison Square Park.\nAmenities at 175 Fifth Avenue include a gym, lap pool, sauna, cold plunge and billiards room. The Brodsky Group and Sorgente Group are spearheading the conversion of the early 20th-century office building, which will hold 38 residential units. The first glimpse of pricing released by the developers included, among others, an $11 million three-bedroom unit and a $50 million five-bedroom condo.\nCorcoran Sunshine, led by Donna Puzio and Angeli DeCecchis, is heading sales at the project.\nOf the 41 homes, 25 were condos, nine were co-ops, two were condops and five were townhouses.\nThe properties asked a combined $311 million, which works out to an average price of $7.6 million and a median of $5.9 million. The typical home was on the market for more than a year and had a discount of 13 percent.\n",

Those two malls are cross-collateralized on the same loan, and the Ghemerzians have struggled with the debt.\nThe family in 2022 got a four-year extension on the American Dream\u2019s $1.7 billion construction loan, which will come due next year.\nThe developers have\nalso struggled\nto get a proposed $5 billion American Dream Miami project off the ground.\n",

        "content": "\u201cI would never invest in rental housing in New York,\u201d a Florida real estate person emailed me in July. \u201cNo wonder there\u2019s a rental housing shortage there. New York is a terrible place to be a housing services provider.\u201d\nI like pointing out contradictions, so I replied that a housing shortage is good for investments in rental housing, because scarcity keeps rents high.\nBut the Florida guy wrote back, \u201cNot where there\u2019s rent control and a war on housing services providers. And New York is the worst!\u201d\nWhy not invest in free-market rentals, which are about half of the city\u2019s rental units?\n\u201cPrefer places where rent regulation is against the law. Less risk that my non-rent regulated investment becomes rent regulated.\u201d\nI thought: That has not happened in 50 years, and the risk of it happening again is close to zero. But I let the conversation die \u2014 or so I thought.\nThree and a half months later, Zohran Mamdani was elected mayor. Lo and behold, the Florida guy dug up our email thread and came back like a bad rash.\n\u201cStill think New York is a great place to be an HSP?\u201d he wrote.\nI was getting testy, but answered politely: \u201cIf your buildings are free-market, yes. Rent-stabilized, no. A Mamdani victory has been baked in for four months now. Free-market rents have remained strong.\u201d\nThen came a comment I wasn\u2019t expecting.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s to stop Mamdani from freezing rents on properties that are currently free market?\u201d\nWas he baiting me? No. It was an honest question \u2014 born from a fear that Mamdani is a Svengali-like figure who could turn the city into a socialist state.\nI assured the reader that the city has no authority to enact universal rent control, let alone freeze all rents. The Urstadt Law makes rent stabilization a state matter.\nThe closest that New York has come to this is\nGood Cause Eviction\n, a 2024 law that makes it hard for a landlord to evict a tenant for nonpayment after a rent increase greater than 5 percent plus the rate of inflation.\nThe initial soft cap on rents was\nnearly 9 percent\n\u2014 a far cry from a hard cap of zero percent.\nBut Mamdani has caused such panic among some people that they think he could do anything.\nReality check: Even if he hypnotized the state legislature and instructed it to pass universal rent control with zero percent increases, it would be challenged in federal court and ruled an unconstitutional taking.\nI should have known that the Florida guy wouldn\u2019t accept this. Mamdani haters have whipped themselves into an absolute frenzy. I saw one person on X tweet that every Jew she knows is talking about leaving New York \u2014 \u201cEvery. Single. One.\u201d\nShe clearly has a close circle of like-minded friends. Polling indicates about one-third of Jewish voters supported Mamdani.\nGetting back to rent control: The courts have ruled that changes to rent-regulated housing are constitutional because buyers of those buildings knew those regulations could be adjusted. That rationale would not apply to free-market buildings.\nMamdani\nhas\nproposed rent stabilization for future developments that receive a tax abatement. We actually had that system for a previous version of 421a. Now it only applies to affordable units in those tax-abated buildings.\nEven if Mamdani persuades Albany to go back to the previous system, investors would know in advance if their rental projects would be subjected to stabilization. It couldn\u2019t be applied retroactively.\nFlorida guy, unfortunately, still wasn\u2019t convinced that the \u201ctakings\u201d clause would protect owners of free-market rentals. He noted that the courts have never ruled rent control unconstitutional.\nThat\u2019s like saying the courts have never ruled murder legal. If New York passed a law legalizing murder, I am confident that the courts would strike it down.\nThe truth is, I don\u2019t have to convince people like the Florida guy that New York multifamily \u2014 except for fully rent-stabilized buildings \u2014 is a good bet, despite Mamdani\u2019s rhetoric and disdain for profit.\nSavvy investors know that a mayor only has so much power and is term-limited. If Mamdani scares some investors away, others will see an opportunity. The market will decide.\n",

        "content": "The complex process of taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public is getting yet another wrinkle.\nFederal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the mortgage giants were exploring avenues to pursue equity stakes in technology firms, Bloomberg\nreported\n. Pulte, speaking from a housing conference hosted by news and research outlet ResiClub, claimed technology companies were offering equity in exchange for partnerships.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at taking equity stakes in companies that are willing to give it to us because of how much power Fannie and Freddie have over the whole ecosystem,\u201d Pulte told ResiClub.\nPulte added that he was hoping the companies under government conservatorship would behave more like businesses. Even still, he said he expects them to remain under conservatorship, even as an initial public offering looms in the distance.\nThe administration is looking to sell shares in the two government-backed mortgage giants \u2014 under their federal conservatorship since a 2008 bailout \u2014 at a valuation that could reach $500 billion and raise about $30 billion.\nIt\u2019s in line to be one of the largest public offerings ever and\nbanks are lining up\nto get a piece of the action. The deal could bring a windfall for the federal government, which holds warrants for roughly 80 percent of both firms\u2019 common stock.\nBut it\u2019s a delicate process. Fannie and Freddie underpin almost half of all U.S. mortgages, so any mistake\ncould ripple through housing markets\nand consumer borrowing.\nPulte previously placed the administration\u2019s goal of launching the IPO by the end of the year. In his most recent comments, he said it could still come in this quarter, but could also arrive early next year.\nLast month, Priscilla Almodovar, Fannie\u2019s chief executive officer and president,\nresigned\nfrom her post atop the organization as part of a broader shakeup. Chief Operating Officer Peter Akwaboah assumed the top position in an interim capacity.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The sale amounts to $335,000 per unit.\nNeither firm commented on the deal, which was brokered by JLL\u2019s Mark Stern, Kevin Girard and Zachary Kaufman.\nPGIM put the tower on the market in June, one of several downtown multifamily listings this year as strong rent growth and minimal new supply enticed investors back into the market.\nCompleted in 2006 by PGIM and Chicago-based Fifield Companies, Left Bank sits near the confluence of the Chicago River and marks one of the earliest residential components of Fifield\u2019s master-planned K Station community, which also includes the K2, Echelon and Alta towers. PGIM later bought out Fifield\u2019s stake in 2007.\nJLL\u2019s marketing materials touted an opportunity for upgrades, noting that about 17 percent of units have yet to be modernized \u2014 a potential value-add play for Hines, which has been expanding its residential portfolio nationally.\nRents at Left Bank ranged from $2,432 for studios to $4,162 for two-bedrooms when the property hit the market.\nOther notable trades this year include\nFulbrix Apartments\nin Fulton Market, which sold for $170 million in April, and the $114 million sale of\nElevate Lincoln Park\nin January.\nDowntown apartment rents have surged in the past year as construction slowed to a trickle. Only one multifamily building was completed in central Chicago this year, according to Integra Realty Resources, which reported a\n6.4 percent\nyear-over-year rent increase for Class A properties in the second quarter.\nThe deal builds on Hines\u2019 growing multifamily portfolio. The Houston-based firm is best known locally for developing the\nWolf Point\noffice and residential complex. Hines also paid $148 million late last year for the\nE2 Apartments\nin downtown Evanston.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Investors appear to be taking notice.\nJack Resnick &amp; Sons locked in $147 million in fresh commercial mortgage-backed securities financing for its Lower Manhattan office building at 255 Greenwich Street, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n.\nMorgan Stanley and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale originated the 10-year loan to retire existing debt from MetLife on the 14-story, 600,000-square-foot property, developed by the Resnick family in 1987.\nThe building, adjacent to One World Trade Center, has seen strong leasing traction despite broader market headwinds. In May, information technology firm Pearson VUE signed a 10-year lease for office space at the property, joining anchor tenants including Cornell University, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, the City of New York \u2014 a trio of city government offices\nrenewed\ntheir collective lease for the sixth through ninth floors of the building in 2023 \u2014 the\nCity University of New York\nand Target.\nAn Avison Young tristate debt and equity team led by Scott and Andy Singer arranged the financing. The group also handled the prior loan a decade ago through the Singer &amp; Bassuk Organization, which Avison Young acquired in 2021.\nScott Singer called the deal a continuation of Resnick\u2019s \u201clegacy of excellence,\u201d adding that Morgan Stanley and Soc Gen delivered a \u201csmooth execution.\u201d\n\u201cThe successful refinancing of 255 Greenwich, which Jack Resnick &amp; Sons developed nearly 40 years ago, is a testament to the attractiveness and vitality of Lower Manhattan,\u201d president Jonathan Resnick said in a statement.\nTenants in Manhattan\nsigned deals for 3.6 million square feet\nin October, up by a third from September, according to a Colliers report. That put the year-to-date demand at 33.7 million square feet, already surpassing last year\u2019s total; if the pace holds, this year could mark the first time since 2019 that annual leasing activity tops 40 million square feet.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "West Shore bought a 542-unit apartment complex in Palm Beach Gardens for $117.9 million, marking a continuing uptick of multifamily investment sales in South Florida.\nBoston-based West Shore bought the Palm Beach Gardens Apartments at 4120 Union Square Boulevard from Aventura-based Advenir, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The buyer borrowed a $550 million loan that is cross-collateralized across this complex, a property in Pinellas County and out-of-state properties, with the Florida properties representing 25.3 percent of the collateral. Citybank is the lender of the financing, which matures in 2030.\nCompleted in 1970 and 1971, Palm Beach Gardens Apartments consists of 34 two-story rental buildings, a storage building and a clubhouse, Vizzda records show. The complex is on 21.5 acres.\nPalm Beach Gardens Apartments offers one-bedroom to three-bedroom apartments, with monthly rents ranging from $1,842 to over $2,855, according to its website.\nLed by David Vecchitto, Advenir bought the complex for\n$97.3 million\nin 2018, scoring an\n$80 million\nloan that year to renovate the property, records show.\nAdvenir is a developer, investor and manager of multifamily properties and single-family rental homes, according to its website. It has owned and managed more than 30,000 units since it was founded in 1996 and currently has a $2.9 billion portfolio.\nWest Shore is a multifamily investment and management firm with a portfolio of more than 18,500 units across 54 properties valued at over $4.5 billion, its website shows. It\u2019s led by Lee E. Rosenthal.\nSouth Florida\u2019s\nmultifamily market\nhas experienced a supply overhang following a construction flurry in recent years. Last year, a record\n18,600 apartments\nwere completed, outpacing 15,000 net new leases, CoStar Group data shows. This led to slower lease-ups, more concessions and a slight decline in the average asking rent in the tri-county region.\nDevelopers\ncontinue building\n, arguing that demand and rent growth will be restored by the time they finish their projects.\nMultifamily\ninvestment sales\nhave been ticking up in recent months, despite still higher interest rates. Many of the buyers are value-add investors or are circumventing the harder financing climate by using Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae loans, or debt from insurers. Others are assuming sellers\u2019 loans, relying on discretionary funds or paying all cash.\nLast month, Morgan Properties paid\n$69.95 million\nfor the 300-unit Visions at Willow Pond complex at 4860 Sand Stone Lane near West Palm Beach, and Tishman Speyer paid\n$124.5 million\nfor the 270-unit Bell at Broken Sound Apartments at 5500 Broken Sound Boulevard Northwest and 950 Northwest Broken Sound Parkway in Boca Raton.\nAlso, TA Realty bought the 476-unit San Merano at Mirasol Apartments at 100 Portofino Drive in Palm Beach Gardens for\n$193 million\nlast month.\n",

Of the 164 residences, 17 of the for-sale units would be set aside for moderate-income households,\ndefined\nin Los Angeles County as a maximum annual income of $89,550 for one person.\nThe project\u2019s proximity to Metro\u2019s new Foothill extension, which opened in September, is the latest addition to the region\u2019s growing\nhousing near transit\ntrend. It\u2019s unclear if MW Investment Group plans to take advantage of Transit Oriented Communities incentives offered by state and municipal governments.\nAt the same time, suburban cities across the San Gabriel Valley and the rest of Greater Los Angeles are figuring out how to meet state housing goals while managing pushback from locals. MW Investment Group has pursued similar infill plays elsewhere in the county, including a townhome project in\nWhittier\n. That project, slated to rise on a 0.8-acre site at 12826 Philadelphia Street, will consist of 24 two-, three- and four-bedroom townhomes as well as 59 parking spaces. Whittier officials signed off on the project early this year.\nLast year, San Dimas considered proposed zoning rule changes around its Metro stop that would enable the construction of up to 3,687 new homes in the city, Urbanize Los Angeles\nreported\n. San Dimas\u2019\nhousing element\ncalls for 1,248 new housing units by 2029.\nMW\u2019s effort in San Dimas comes as\ninvestor interest in multifamily projects\ndries up despite increasing rents and demand. The City of Los Angeles in particular has been hit hard thanks in large part to\nMeasure ULA\n, the tax on property sales higher than $5 million, as well as rising construction materials and labor costs.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Blue Owl Capital has a 48-megawatt facility nearby that\u2019s also vacant.\nThe holdup underscores a mounting crisis for the data center industry, where demand is exploding due to artificial intelligence and cloud computing but aging transmission infrastructure and permitting delays are choking supply.\nElectricity needs tied to AI alone are expected to more than double in the U.S. by 2035,\naccording\nto BloombergNEF.\nSanta Clara is the home of Nvidia, the world\u2019s most valuable company, whose processing chips have become crucial pieces of the growing AI puzzle.\nSanta Clara has 57 active or planned data centers. Power costs in the\nSilicon Valley\ncity are high, but proximity to tech firms and users that can\u2019t run on long-distance latency in power transmission, such as autonomous vehicle companies, keeps developers interested in building in the area.\n\u201cThe demand has never been higher, and it\u2019s really a power-supply problem that we have,\u201d Bill Dougherty, executive vice president for data center solutions at CBRE, told Bloomberg.\nDigital Realty typically spends about 20 to 25 percent of the final construction cost for a shell before a building is readied for occupancy.\nStack Infrastructure\u2019s plant has four floors of empty data halls. A dedicated on-site substation with 12 megawatts of critical capacity is planned to provide power to the building.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Jon Venetos\u2019\nmultifamily distress\n, which\nstarted in Florida\n, is permeating the Texas Triangle.\nFannie Mae slapped Venetos\u2019 Lurin Capital with a lawsuit accusing the firm of defaulting on a $77.2 million loan tied to Latitude 2976, a Houston apartment complex, according to the Nov. 6 filing in District Court for the Southern District of Texas.\nJLL Real Estate Capital provided the mortgage in June 2023, and it was assigned to Fannie Mae.\nThe loan, which has a fixed rate of 5.1 percent, matures in August 2028, the lawsuit said. Lurin stopped making payments in June, Fannie Mae alleges.\nFannie Mae further accuses Lurin of failing to keep the property in good condition.\nLurin failed to make repairs identified in a March property inspection, Fannie Mae claims. The lender said Lurin \u201cleft the Property to further deteriorate in ways that present immediate danger to tenants and accelerate waste of Fannie Mae\u2019s collateral.\u201d In addition to mold, roof leaks and cracked stairs, some residents don\u2019t have access to running water, Fannie Mae alleges.\nOver $749,000 in liens have been filed against the property, not including a $107,529 default judgment against the property awarded to a law firm that helped evict tenants from the property.\nFannie Mae is asking the District Court for the Southern District of Texas to appoint a receiver for the property, a 734-unit complex built in 1976 at 201 and 301 Wilcrest Drive. The property is south of the Buffalo Bayou, near Briar Forest.\nThe lawsuit is one of several for Jon and Ashley Venetos\u2019 \u201cvalue-add\u201d multifamily operation.\nJudge Bryan Gantt granted the city of Plano a temporary restraining order against Lurin on Oct. 27 and\nordered residents of Evana Grove Apartments to vacate\ndue to unsafe conditions.\nAccording to the filing, residents of the complex at 3500 Hillridge Drive didn\u2019t have access to water, sewer or gas \u2014 even though the property had racked up 1,459 code violations and ownership and management of Evana Grove was on the receiving end of nearly 100 lawsuits over conditions at the property.\nThe Venetoses\u2019 legal trouble started ratcheting up in the spring when lender Acore claimed Lurin defaulted on nearly $400 million worth of loans tied to properties in Florida and Texas. The 12 Florida properties\nheaded to foreclosure auction\nin April.\nAcore also claims Venetos personally guaranteed the $394.4 million he borrowed. The lender filed six lawsuits in October\nasking for judgments totaling $80.7 million\n, Venetos\u2019 payment guaranties, plus other default-related expenses, court records show.\nAcore alleges his liability was triggered when he defaulted on the loans and when he allowed mechanics\u2019 liens to be placed on the properties.\nVenetos is also fighting a\nrecent lawsuit from Select Securities Europe\n, a lender from Luxembourg that claims he defaulted on 15 loans totaling $40.5 million.\nJon and Ashley Venetos launched Lurin Capital in 2016 amid a wave of upstart real estate operators who planned to make money by purchasing Class B apartment complexes, updating them, raising rents and selling them at a profit.\nLurin\u2019s website says the firm owns 46 properties across five states, but the list includes assets that have faced foreclosure.\nInterest rates threw sand in the gears for many of them, increasing debt service on their floating-rate loans and raising construction costs. At the same time, Texas, a hotspot for value-add multifamily operators, was absorbing a historic wave of apartment development, causing rental rates and occupancy levels to fall.\nAs a result, experts anticipate\na wave of multifamily distress in Texas\n, where about $19 billion in CMBS loans tied to multifamily is set to mature in the next five years.\n",

        "content": "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is taking another swing at property tax reform, pitching a six-point plan that would slash appraisal growth, restrict local spending and give voters far greater control over tax increases.\nAbbott\u2019s proposal, announced Sunday during his reelection campaign kickoff in Houston, marks one of his most aggressive attempts yet to overhaul how Texas\nfunds local services\n\u2014 a perennial issue in a state with no income tax and fast-rising property values, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nMuch of the plan would require a constitutional amendment, with Abbott vowing to make property\ntax relief\na top legislative priority.\nAccording to Abbott, the Legislature\u2019s record $51 billion allocation for tax relief this year was blunted by\nlocal governments\nraising their own levies. His plan seeks to counter that by tying local spending growth to 3.5 percent or population plus inflation, whichever is lower, and by extending the state\u2019s debt and deficit limits to counties, cities and school districts.\nThe proposal would also require a two-thirds voter majority for any new local property tax hikes, effectively giving\ntaxpayers\nveto power over local budgets. Residents could also petition to roll back existing taxes if 15 percent of local voters sign on \u2014 a mechanism Abbott says would help check \u201crunaway\u201d local government spending.\nTo tackle the state\u2019s appraisal battles, the plan would cap homestead valuation growth at 3 percent, down from 10 percent, and extend the limit to rental and commercial properties. Appraisals would occur only once every five years, eliminating what Abbott called \u201csurprise\u201d annual increases that fuel taxpayer frustration.\nPerhaps the most sweeping measure would allow voters to decide whether to eliminate school district property taxes altogether. Those levies make up the largest share of Texans\u2019 property tax bills, but Abbott\u2019s outline offers no detail on how the state would fund schools if that revenue vanished \u2014 a likely flashpoint should lawmakers consider the plan.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

That prior record was for the $16.8 million sale of 467 Comstock Avenue, which sold for $1,763 per square foot in March.\nThe deal is a long time coming for seller Jacqueline Heller, who has owned the property since 1999 and originally sought $24.9 million for the home in 2022. It was re-priced over the years and also changed hands among listing agents during that period with the most recent ask just under $22 million, or $2,142 per square foot.\nZac Mostame and Yasmine Benmaiza of Carolwood Estates represented Heller in the deal. Victoria Velazquez of Compass\u2019 The Jancula Group represented buyer Savita Kanodia, according to public records.\nThe Strathmore Drive sale marks another record for Mostame, who along with the Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Lea Porter, represented both the buyer and seller in the off-market trade of\n1124 Napoli Drive\nin the Pacific Palisades for $25.8 million. The September deal, which equates to $2,437 per square foot, is the Palisades\u2019 top residential trade this year.\nThe Little Holmby property\u2019s original structure was built in 1937. Over a decade ago, the home was taken down to its studs and redeveloped by architect and historical restoration specialist Richard Manion and builder Richard Holz.\nThe 10,000-square-foot residence draws its design inspiration from the English countryside, with a formal living room, library with mahogany paneling, a kitchen with skylights and coffered ceilings in the living room. Outdoors, there are walking paths, a botanical garden, pool, fire pit and a dining pergola for more than 45 guests.\nAdditional highlights include a half basketball court, an elevator, two offices and a room just for wrapping gifts.\n",

Vornado is partnering with Rudin Management and hedge fund Citadel on the development of the tower located between East 50th and 51st streets.\nThe permit application describes a 62-story building totaling more than 2 million square feet.\nCitadel, in addition to being a partner on the project, has agreed to rent space in the tower. Vornado announced in 2022 that the hedge fund giant would pay an initial rent of $36 million for the space, backdated to 2022. The company and its sister firm, Citadel Securities, plan to occupy 850,000 square feet in the building.\nCitadel, Vornado and Rudin did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nPlans for the high-rise have been gestating for years, but\nthe Department of City Planning\ngave the trio of firms the green light in September, according to\nNew York YIMBY\n. The three buildings on the site, one a 30-story office tower, will need to be demolished for the new high-rise. Plans for the project include a 12,500-square-foot outdoor public plaza and 16,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space, according to YIMBY.\nMichael Ritchie of AAI Architects filed the permit application. Architectural firm Foster + Partners is reportedly also working on the structure. The two firms partnered previously on 425 Park Avenue, a 650,000 square foot building completed in 2022, according to AAI\u2019s website.\nFoster + Partners is the architect behind another Park Avenue office tower turning heads,\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s recently opened headquarters\nat 270 Park.\nAlthough the New York office market overall is still cooler than it was pre-pandemic, Class A office space, specifically on Park Avenue and near Grand Central Terminal, has been\nin high demand\n.\nThe 350 Park development was made possible by the 2017\nrezoning of Midtown East\n. The change allowed landmarked buildings to sell their development rights to nonadjacent sites when they are under the total buildable area allowed by the city.\nIn 2023, Citadel signed an agreement to\nbuy air rights\nfrom St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, paying the Archdiocese of New York for $312.50 per square foot. The developers are also required to pay $62.50 per square foot purchased to a Midtown East improvement fund.\nRenderings of the proposed development show a stepped, staircase-like profile and floor-to-ceiling windows.\n",

The seller, two entities managed by Mario Hernandez in\nSunrise\n, paid $5.4 million for the 17-acre site in 2005, and completed the shopping center the same year, records show.\nCrunch Fitness, the Fish Joint, Lefty\u2019s Tavern &amp; Grille, Club Men Barbershop, Pasquale &amp; Son\u2019s Pizza Co. and Aldo Cleaners are among the tenants at Shoppes at Heron Lakes.\nJPMorgan\u2019s acquisition is the third shopping center sale this month in Coral Springs. A joint venture between Boca Raton-based Carlyle Management, led by Charles Rosner, and an entity managed by Edward Rutkovsky in Boca Raton paid\n$60.5 million\nfor Royal Eagle Plaza\u00a0 at 9100-9190 Wiles Road. The seller, Columbus, Ohio-based Washington Prime Group, completed the shopping center on the 11.7-acre site in 1989.\nAlso this month, Deerfield Beach-based and Lynn, Massachusetts-based Perkins Realty Management, led by Andrew Perkins, bought Esplanade Center at 901-1001 University Drive for\n$26.5 million\n. The medical office and retail plaza\u2019s tenants include Jenny Craig, Sage Dental, State Farm Insurance, Vino Salon Studios, Mattress Firm and Tijuana Taxi Co.\nJPMorgan has more than $79 billion in real estate assets globally as of June 30, according to the firm\u2019s website. In September, JPMorgan listed a 23-story office building in New York for\n$270 million\n, roughly half the $550 million the firm was asking when the property was previously for sale in 2020.",

        "content": "Home affordability in the Los Angeles area has gotten a bit better for potential buyers.\nIn Greater L.A., 16 percent of households could afford to buy a home at the median price of $837,060 in the third quarter of this year, up from 14 percent in the second quarter and small tick up from 15 percent in the third quarter of last year, Westside Current\nreported\n, citing new data from the California Association of Realtors.\nAt the same time, the median\nprice of existing single-family homes\nin California dropped 2 percent in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Year-over-year, however,\nhome prices\nhave bounced back, increasing 0.8 percent after the first decline in eight quarters earlier this year. Easing mortgage rates have likely attracted more buyers to\nthe SoCal residential market\n. Housing affordability could notch up even further if lower mortgage rates emerge in the coming months of the off-season and if economic uncertainties clear up.\nIn Los Angeles County in particular, 12 percent of households could afford to purchase the $954,130 median-priced home in the third quarter \u2014 a slight tick down from 13 percent in the second quarter, though it\u2019s a slight improvement from 11 percent in the third quarter of last year. In\nOrange County\n, 13 percent percent of households could afford to purchase the $1.4 million median-priced home in the third quarter of 2025, up from 12 percent in the second quarter 2025 and up from 12 percent in Q3 2024.\nAffordability widens for condos and townhomes. Overall, in California, 27 percent of households statewide could afford a typical condo or townhome in the third quarter, up from 25 percent in the second quarter and the same number in the third quarter of last year. To make monthly payments on a $649,990 median-priced condo or townhome in the third quarter, residents would have to have an annual income of $163,600.\nHousing affordability is still notably lower in the Golden State than nationwide. More than one third of households across the country could purchase a $426,800 median-priced home, which required a minimum annual income of $107,600 to make monthly payments. Affordability nationwide increased slightly from 35 percent in both the second quarter of 2025 and a year ago.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The project would include five electric substations to power the energy-hungry operations\n.\nThe bid from Prologis came out on top over plans from\nTrammell Crow Company\nand Catellus-Deca, a joint venture between\nCatellus Development Corporation\nand Deca Companies.\nCatellus-Deca pitched 3 million square feet of flex space that could become data centers, research and development space or a business park; the plans also included 562,000 square feet of retail. Trammell Crow proposed 3.2 million square feet of warehouse space, 54,000 square feet of office and 60,000 square feet of retail.\nOfficials favored Prologis for its commitment to finance all construction and its higher projected economic return for San Jose, according to a\nCity of San Jose\nmemo cited by the outlet. Catellus-Deca was tapped to stay on deck as a backup developer should an alternative be needed.\nThe city bought the land as a buffer for the wastewater treatment plant, and it is restricted against odor-sensitive uses such as housing or hotels. San Jose began seeking proposals in May with a goal of spurring job growth in tech-focused industries and generating recurring ground-lease and tax revenue.\nPrologis\u2019 proposal still has to go through the approval process. The proposal is set to be heard at the City of San Jose\u2019s Treatment Plant Advisory Committee\u2019s meeting this week, and the San Jose City Council meeting on Nov. 18. If Prologis\u2019 project is greenlit at the upcoming meetings, it must still complete\nCEQA review\nand ground lease negotiations, among other steps.\nThe firm aims to begin construction in 2028 with initial occupancy in 2030.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

They intend to purchase more air rights in the coming weeks, per the filing.\nThe pair plan to develop a massive residential project with about 200 condos, 299 rental units and 20,000 square feet of commercial space at a cost of about $400 million, per the TASE filing. Valley National Bank provided a $31.5 million loan for the purchase, which was first reported by\nPincusCo\n.\nThe development is down the street from another massive mixed-use project Dushinsky and Gluck are building at\n625 Fulton Street\n. That 35-story, two-tower project\nhas 1,098 units and retail space.\nThe Brooklyn site has changed hands multiple times in recent years. In 2015, the Feil Organization acquired the three-story building at the site from Capital One\nfor $43 million\n, then pieced together a seven-parcel development site. In 2021, Feil submitted plans for a 363-unit residential building. The plans called for 421 apartments, 30 percent of them affordable under the 421a program.\nAfter permits were approved, Extell signed a long-term $85.9 million ground lease with Feil in 2022, signifying that Barnett\u2019s firm would take over the project. Demolition was nearly complete at the end of that year, according to\nNew York YIMBY\n.\nIt\u2019s unclear why Barnett decided to exit the project. Representatives for Extell, Rabsky and Gluck did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Feil declined to comment.\n",

The contracts had a total last asking volume of $80 million, beating\nthe previous period\u2019s total of 19 contracts\nsigned for $66 million.\nThe priciest contract signed last week was for a townhouse on 152 DeKalb Avenue in Fort Greene asking $4.7 million.\nThe 20-foot-wide home spans 3,200 square feet and comes with six bedrooms and three full bathrooms. The home is currently set up as an owner\u2019s triplex and a one-bedroom garden rental.\nBuilt in the 1880s for publishing mogul James Gordon Bennett, the home was renovated in the early 2000s. It still retains its original plaster moldings, window shutters, marble mantels, parquet floors and stairway wainscoting, and has two functional wood-burning fireplaces.\nThe home has a deck overlooking its 55-foot-long back garden.\nCompass\u2019 Kathleen Perkins had the listing.\nThe second most expensive deal signed was for a townhouse at 274 Clinton Avenue in Clinton Hill asking $4.5 million.\nThe Italianate brownstone spans 4,500 square feet and is configured as a garden-level duplex and an upper-level triplex. It comes with three wood-burning fireplaces and a back deck and garden.\nThe garden duplex features two bedrooms, a full bathroom and a chef\u2019s kitchen with a formal dining room. The upper triplex has four bedrooms and three bathrooms.\nAn entity tied to Sherwood Equities, a privately-held real estate firm, bought the property for $3.6 million in 2016. The firm has held a number of high-profile developments in the city in recent years. It is\nshopping a site at Hudson Yards\n, which can be turned into a 233-unit residential development, for north of $100 million.\nSteven Novick, president of the firm\u2019s brokerage arm, had the listing.\nHomes entering contract last week had a median asking price of $2.75 million, an average price per square foot of $1,413 and spent an average of 78 days on the market.\n",

        "content": "Borough presidents once again have more sway over the city\u2019s land use process.\nThe borough president races went pretty much as expected last week: The incumbents won in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal won his bid for Manhattan Borough President, replacing Mark Levine, who will be the city\u2019s next comptroller.\nBut Election Day also granted these five officials more authority over certain housing projects in their boroughs.\nOne of the ballot questions approved by voters creates a three-person appeals board that, as part of the land use review process, can reverse City Council rejections of housing projects that would result in affordable housing in one borough. The board\u2019s members include the mayor, City Council speaker and respective borough president.\nKen Fisher, a land-use attorney with Cozen O\u2019Connor, told me last week that he views the borough president as the appeals board\u2019s\nswing vote\n. If a rezoning was approved by the City Planning Commission, presumably it has the mayor\u2019s support. The City Council speaker will likely be reluctant to go against the Council, leaving the borough president to decide the project\u2019s fate (two out of three of the board\u2019s members must vote to reverse a decision).\nBorough presidents have an advisory role in the city\u2019s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure. It wasn\u2019t always this way. Borough presidents sat on the Board of Estimate, which originally had the final vote at the end of Ulurp. That changed in 1989, when the Board of Estimate was deemed unconstitutional and the City Council was, effectively, given final word over land use actions.\nOf course, the extent to which borough presidents are elevated depends on how often the appeals board is called to action. Local Council members and developers may want to avoid a project getting to that point.\nStill, even just early support from a borough president could help steer negotiations or embolden a developer to move forward with a project they may have otherwise abandoned, fearing that the local Council member would kill it. Of course, the same could be said if a borough president makes clear upfront that they will not support a project or will not support it unless certain conditions are met.\nJust like the local City Council member, the borough president could draw a line in the sand over affordability levels in a project. In fact, Hoylman-Signal\ncriticized\nthe Soho/Noho rezoning in 2021 for not guaranteeing more affordable housing and, more recently, pushed for 100 percent affordable housing on city- and state-owned sites.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nDo you have a project that could benefit from any of the housing ballot measures? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nMembers of the\nCarpenters\u2019 Company\n, a trade guild founded in 1724, built Independence Hall and Christ Church in Philadelphia. Despite its name, the group\u2019s members were not carpenters but architects, engineers and contractors.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\nMayor-elect Zohran Mamdani on Monday tapped Dean Fuleihan, who served as first deputy mayor and budget director under Mayor Bill de Blasio, as his first deputy mayor. He also announced that Elle Bisgaard-Church, his campaign manager, will serve as his chief of staff.\n\u2014\nCity officials on Monday announced new ferry routes will open between the Bronx and Rockaways, as well as Brooklyn and Staten Island\n,\nGothamist reports\n. The routes will take effect Dec. 8.\n\u2014\nIn the coming weeks, Council member Chi Oss\u00e9 is expected to announce his plan to challenge Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader of the House, in June,\nthe New York Times reports\n. The mayor-elect has reportedly discouraged Oss\u00e9 from running.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$14.2 million\nfor a condominium unit at 250 West Street. The Tribeca condo unit is 4,100 square feet and was listed by\nThe Corcoran Group\u2019s\nRichard Ziegelasch.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$18.9 million\nfor 63-60 98th Street. The Rego Park rental has 129 units and is 125,600 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $128 million for a condo unit at 217 West 57th Street. The Central Park Tower condo is 11,500 square feet.\nCompass\u2019s Carl Gambino\nhas the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 263,775-square-foot, 13-story, mixed-use building at 15 Oak Street in Brooklyn. Robert Laudenschlager of SLCE Architects is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

Gavin Newsom signed SB 1211, which increased the number of detached\naccessory dwelling units\nthat are allowed to be built on multifamily lots. Part of the facility includes the $30 million recapitalization of seven LWK properties for the addition of 50 ADUs.\nIn their efforts as co-general partners, Cypress is charged with heading development while LWK focuses on acquisitions, said LWK co-founder and partner Austin Nissly.\nIt isn\u2019t the first time Cypress has worked with Ascent. The deal for a so-called \u201crinse-and-repeat facility\u201d allows LWK and Cypress to shift back and forth between acquisition and construction loans as they take up more projects.\nThe goal is to increase LWK\u2019s portfolio from 200 multifamily units to 5,000 over the next five years, with transactions between $3 million and $10 million being ideal targets. To do this, LWK and Cypress will juggle acquisitions and holdings under LWK ownership that can be revamped for workforce housing.\nAs it stands, LWK\u2019s properties are concentrated in West Adams and Mid-City, but the firm has expressed interest in\nSanta Monica\n, Hollywood, Leimert Park and the San Fernando Valley.\nLWK and Cypress recently bought a 20-unit property in Hollywood for $4 million; the companies plan to add eight ADUs with a cost per unit for one-bedrooms of less than $150,000.\nAnother project from the joint venture involves three eight-unit buildings on three parcels with plans to add four ADUs to each parcel, upping density by 50 percent.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Two waterfront Lake Geneva houses sold last week, showcasing big gains in property value through flips on both while adding to the\nstring of big deals\nin the Wisconsin resort town.\nThe two deals, which both closed on Friday, are the\nlatest of several high-end houses\nto sell this fall in Lake Geneva, a\npopular second home location\nfor Chicagoland residents.\nOne house, at W3240 Park Drive, sold for nearly $6 million. The 3,300-square-foot house has private lake frontage and a private pier with a boat slip.\nIt\u2019s the third time in as many years that listing agent\nWendy Murphy\n, with Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, has sold the house. It sold in November 2024 for $5.25 million, and in August 2023 for $4.2 million, growing its value by about 43 percent in two years. The sales give an insight into property value appreciation on Lake Geneva, Murphy said.\n\u201cThere seems to be no lack of interest in that higher end market here in Lake Geneva,\u201d she said.\nAt less than 3,300-square-feet, the Park Drive house is the smallest of the lakefront homes to sell this fall. Still, its condition and architectural style made it an attractive property, Murphy said. The home was designed by Engerman Contracting, a custom home builder in Lake Geneva.\n\u201cIt is the perfect size for a family to be able to gather,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just has that architecture that just screams the Cape Cod feel.\u201d\nThe sellers of the Park Drive house are Philip and Melody Lekousis, according to property records. The house had an interested buyer before the listing went public, Murphy said, and the house ultimately sold to that party. Murphy declined to share additional details about the buyers or sellers, and the buyers are not yet identified in public records. The buyer\u2019s agent was listed as \u201cnon member\u201d on listing websites.\nThe sellers paid $35,000 in property taxes in 2024, according to county records.\nOn the northeast end of the lake, the house at 8 Hillside Drive sold for $7.4 million on Friday. That house, too, sold in October of last year for $5.9 million, increasing in value by 25 percent in a year.\nThe 4,300-square-foot house has five bedrooms and five bathrooms. It has lakefront access and a boat pier, and sits on a 0.58-acre lot.\nDavid Curry of Geneva Lakefront Realty represented both the buyers and the sellers on the deal. He didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\nThe house was purchased under an LLC that obscures the new owner\u2019s identity. The previous owners were Vincent and Patricia Kolber, public records show. The tax bill for the property in 2024 was about $53,000, property records show.\nThis fall has seen a run of luxury home buying on Lake Geneva. Seven homes have sold on the lakefront for more than $5 million in the last three months, according to listing services. In the eight months preceding that, just five homes sold on the lakefront at that price.\nThat\u2019s in part because sales activity has shifted to later months over the last few years, Murphy said. Until recently, listing and buying activity would pick up in the early spring and summer. Now, Murphy said houses aren\u2019t going on the market until late summer.\n\u201cA lot of that is sellers are seeing that they\u2019re commanding high prices, and they want to get one more year out of it, and be able to use the house for the summer months,\u201d Murphy said.\nThat buzz may taper off in the winter, Murphy said. Only two waterfront Lake Geneva houses are currently publicly listed. One is a 7,800-square-foot new construction on South Lake Shore Drive that listed for $10 million in late September. The other, a log cabin-style home, has had less luck than most properties on the lake. It was listed Aug. 22 for $6.75 million but has had its price chopped twice since then, and it\u2019s now asking $5.6 million.\n",

Wilson and her sister, Swedlana Dass, agreed earlier this year to auction off their sprawling portfolio to settle more than $11 million in debts, the Illinois Answers Project\nreported\n.\nWilson, a Northbrook resident who oversees a number of property management companies in Chicago, has been fined more than\n$15 million for rat-related\nreasons since 2010, according to city and state records. The fines are tied to nearly 30 companies, all owned by Wilson.\nThe city\u2019s bet that the bulk sale would spark reinvestment and fill its coffers, however, fell short.\nRoughly\n800 properties\nonce controlled by the sisters went to auction this spring. Only about a third found buyers, generating just $3.4 million, far below the $12 million Wilson once claimed the \u201ctop 150 to 200\u201d parcels could bring. More than 500 weed-strewn lots remain unsold, many in Englewood, West Pullman and Greater Grand Crossing, where years of disinvestment have sapped private interest.\n\u201cWhatever remuneration happens in the end, we have a single goal,\u201d Mary Richardson-Lowry, the city\u2019s\ncorporation counsel\n, told the outlet. \u201cShe should no longer be in the city, owning property in a way that harms communities.\u201d\nWilson and Dass\u2019s\nreal estate empire\n\u2014 assembled through more than 20 shell LLCs with names like Dagny, Dorchester and Discount Inn \u2014 grew over three decades from scavenger sales meant to return tax-delinquent land to productive use. Instead, the properties became magnets for trash, weeds and rats. A 2023 Illinois Answers investigation found more than $15 million in unpaid fines tied to their holdings.\nThe auction, approved through bankruptcy court after the city sued the sisters, was touted by Hilco Real Estate as a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity.\nInstead, it exposed how little appetite there is for vacant land in Chicago\u2019s poorest neighborhoods. Most lots sold for about $5,000 each, with investors gravitating toward West Side areas like Garfield Park and Austin, while dozens of parcels in struggling South Side districts drew no bids.\nBuyers ranged from neighbors seeking to formalize side yards to speculators betting on long-term upside. The city and CTA bought a handful of sites for affordable housing and transit-oriented projects, including parcels slated to offset parkland lost to the Red Line extension.\nEven with the disappointing returns, city officials consider the sale a partial victory. Wilson and Dass have been forced to shed hundreds of lots and are now in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, facing full liquidation. A New York lender that financed the bankruptcy with a $4 million loan will be paid before the city sees any proceeds.\nIf the sisters somehow retain ownership of their unsold holdings, Richardson-Lowry said the city will pursue them again.\n\u201cIf anyone thinks this is over, they\u2019re not paying attention,\u201d she said.\nThe case serves as a sizable example of a larger dilemma for the city. That is, thousands of vacant lots, most in private hands, languishing in neighborhoods still waiting for reinvestment.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

It would triple the amount of housing built in the area over the past two decades.\nThe proposal, submitted on Monday to the city\u2019s Planning Department, calls for a mix of mid- and high-rise towers as tall as 30 stories on the 4-acre site north of\nAlamo Square Park\n. About 15 percent of the units would be set aside for\naffordable housing\n, creating a \u201cdiverse mix of unit types, income levels and uses\u201d for \u201can inclusive, mixed-income community\u201d that would help meet state housing goals, the company said in a statement.\nThe plan also includes a 500-stall garage under one tower and a smaller, 20,000-square-foot grocery store to replace the Safeway, which closed last year after four decades due to what the company said were theft and safety issues.\nAlign Real Estate moved to\nbuy the defunct Safeway location\nin 2022. The firm remains in contract to buy the property from the Pleasanton-based grocery chain; the sale is slated to close when construction starts on the sites. In the meantime, Align is talking with potential supermarket tenants after members of the community called for another grocery tenant to move into the 40,000-square-foot building at the site.\nEarlier this year, Smart &amp; Final submitted a bid to move into the abandoned Safeway building as part of a short-term lease that could be extended. It isn\u2019t clear if discussions between Smart &amp; Final and Align are still active.\nAlign is currently working to lock down the necessary financing to break ground once entitlements are secured. Align is also planning to file additional development applications in the coming weeks that call for the construction of more than 3,500 new homes across the city, of which about 500 will be affordable units.\nAs part of its\nhousing element\n, the city of San Francisco must permit 82,069 new housing units by 2031.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Horton\ncontracted with Prophetic, which collates zoning restrictions, parcel ownership data, topography, environmental regulations and market activity on one platform designed to generate site plans and yield estimates for subdivision homebuilders more quickly.\nThe startup was founded in Portland, Oregon, last year.\nThe software has been compared to\nCityBldr\n, a platform that uses machine learning to find underutilized or high-potential development sites for commercial real estate. The company has other homebuilder clients, including\nCentury Communities\n, but Texas-based D.R. Horton is its biggest yet.\nProphetic has parcel data from over 20 states so far, and it will expand to more than 30 states in time for D.R. Horton to implement it, said Prophetic CEO Oliver Alexander, who is the founder of remote job board Remotely and of the rural clinic chain Orchid Health.\nThe company aims to have parcel data from all 50 states by June.\n\u201cWe have national availability of recorder and assessor data, as well as MLS data, as well as a ton of environmental diligence layers, as we call them,\u201d Alexander said.\nThat environmental information includes flood zones, wetlands, power lines that may bisect the site, school zones, soil data and toxicity issues.\nProphetic also tracks legal documents for each parcel, such as easements.\n\u201cA couple hundred parcels a month is normal for a productive person on a land team. We have users doing 5,700 parcels a month,\u201d Alexander said.\nD.R. Horton closed 84,863 homes during the fiscal year ending Sept 30, a\n5 percent decrease\nyear over year.\nThe company also ended the year with a smaller inventory than the year before, including 19,600 unsold homes, compared to 25,700 homes unsold at the end of September 2024.\nIn a market of cautious buyers, D.R. Horton has been leaning on\nsales incentives\nto close deals, offering rate buydowns, closing-cost assistance and free upgrades.\n",

In April, San Francisco-based Spear Street Capital acquired Harwood No. 4 after a similar default, with plans for multimillion-dollar renovations.\nHarwood saved\nSaint Ann Court\nfrom foreclosure with a\nrecap deal\nearlier this year.\nAnother\nHarwood\nparcel, at 2840 Bookhout Street, also tied to a First United loan, narrowly avoided the same fate this week. An affiliate, HIC Development XV, filed a temporary restraining order Monday to block its scheduled foreclosure, and both sides reached an agreement to postpone the sale.\nHarwood, led by Swiss-born developer Gabriel Barbier-Mueller, is under pressure from mounting debt and sluggish office demand.\nSince late summer, the firm has sold off four of its signature towers \u2014 Harwood Nos. 2, 6, 7 and 10 \u2014 to\nTPG\n, the Fort Worth- and San Francisco-based private equity firm, in transactions totaling roughly 900,000 square feet. TPG also extended a $100 million loan tied to Harwood\u2019s broader holdings, including the delayed 23-story Harwood No. 15 project.\nHarwood\ntapped Newmark to line up new equity and debt partners as it tries to stabilize its 19-block district, which spans more than 3 million square feet of office, residential and retail space. The long-term vision calls for more than 8 million square feet of mixed-use development.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The residents say the board refused to disclose the buyer\u2019s identity, financing capacity or exclusivity terms, and that it rejected a rival offer from longtime operator Taj Hotels that would have allowed residents to stay.\nThe Pierre\u2019s shareholders want the board to open its books, alleging it violated fiduciary duties by pushing a deal they say it barely understood. The board has maintained that the term sheet is \u201cnonbinding and subject to shareholder approval,\u201d according to the filing.\nThe battle comes as the Pierre \u2014 whose gilded pedigree dates back nearly a century \u2014 struggles to regain its luster. Maintenance and service deteriorated, resulting in fraying carpets and spotty staffing.\nHoward Lutnick, the then-Cantor Fitzgerald CEO who owns the co-op\u2019s penthouse, allegedly helped steer the board toward hiring Newmark Group, the brokerage he ran, to advise on improving the property before pivoting to a sale.\nLutnick, who never lived in the penthouse he\nbought for $44 million\nin 2017, distanced himself from the controversy. A spokesperson for his government department previously said he hadn\u2019t been involved in discussions and disclosed his conflicts before stepping away from his businesses when Trump tapped him for his Commerce Secretary post.\nAs for Burch and her neighbors, however, the betrayal is raw.

        "content": "Douglas Elliman\nis bringing on a new chief technology officer.\nThe firm has tapped Chris Reyes, a veteran in the brokerage industry, to head its technology team, where he\u2019ll be tasked with managing the department as well as supervising product launches and software development, the company announced Tuesday.\nBefore joining Elliman, Reyes was an executive with Brown Harris Stevens, where he served first as chief information and product officer before taking over as CTO in 2022. He\u2019s also held executive technology positions with Guardhill Financial,\nTown Residential and Citi Habitats\n.\nReyes is stepping into the role at a time when most of the industry is focused on\nintegrating artificial intelligence\n. Last month, Elliman announced its own AI assistant app, called Elli AI, which it plans to debut in Florida before expanding its use to other markets.\n\u201cEveryone is talking about AI,\u201d Reyes said. \u201cPersonally, my philosophy is simple. If tools don\u2019t save time or drive revenue, they don\u2019t belong in the stack.\u201d\nA spokesperson for BHS said the firm \u201c[wishes] Chris the best in his next endeavor.\u201d\nReyes will replace Elliman\u2019s former CTO, David Ballard, who was terminated from his post last November on the heels of a\nleadership shakeup\nat the firm.\nCEO Michael Liebowitz \u2014 who took over the firm\u2019s top role last year after longtime leader\nHoward Lorber abruptly retired\n\u2014 said he took his time finding the right person to replace Ballard, including putting him through a \u201crigorous hiring process\u201d adopted by the company under Liebowitz\u2019s tenure.\n\u201cWhile everyone wants to come out with a wham-bam magic Sam technology solution for the industry, we really wanted to find someone who knew the industry,\u201d said Liebowitz. He added that the firm found that in Reyes, and the company will offer Reyes a larger platform than his previous roles.\nLiebowitz said that the firm is betting on AI to help streamline the company\u2019s operations, including lowering expenses and employee counts. He added that the efforts were part of his plan for 2026, the theme for which he described as \u201cbeing about every single person being a revenue generator.\u201d\n\u201c2025 was a transition year,\u201d Liebowitz said. \u201c2026 is our growth year.\u201d\nNews of Elliman\u2019s new executive comes a week after the firm reported its\nthird-quarter earnings\n, including a $25 million net loss. The loss was less than the $27 million it lost in the same quarter last year. The firm also saw revenues decline modestly year-over-year, down from $266 million to $263 million.\nHowever, Elliman did eliminate its debt last month after it sold its property management arm to Associa for\n$85 million\n. The deal allowed the company to pay off a $50 million loan it received from Kennedy Lewis last year.\n",

        "content": "Gatsby Florida is anticipating an influx of New York office tenants for its planned mixed-use project in Palm Beach Gardens in the wake of Zohran Mamdani\u2019s mayoral victory.\nMiami-based Gatsby, led by co-founder\nBabak Ebrahimzadeh\n, finalized construction plans for The Modern at Palm Beach Gardens, a 220,000-square-foot building and an adjacent six-level parking garage with 838 spaces, a press release states. The developer plans to break ground next year and expects to complete the project in 2027.\nIn 2022, a Gatsby affiliate bought a 7-acre development site at 11200 RCA Center Drive for\n$17.5 million\nfrom Palm Beach Gardens-based developer Daniel Catalfumo, records show. Gatsby\u2019s project is based on a previous site plan for Catalfumo\u2019s PGA Tower project, which was approved by the city of Palm Beach Gardens in 2021.\nRoughly 25 percent of The Modern at Palm Beach Gardens\u2019 199,000 square feet of office space is pre-leased, the release states. The building will also have 21,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space. Darryl Kaplan with Darryl R. Kaplan Company is handling leasing for the new project.\nIn a statement, Ebrahimzadeh said leasing momentum should accelerate based on the results of the\nNew York mayoral election\n. Many South Florida developers and brokers are betting that\nMamdani\n, a Democratic Socialist who made campaign promises for free buses and rent freezes for rent-stabilized buildings, will drive a new wave of New Yorkers to the Sunshine State\u2019s tri-county region.\n\u201cThe consistent corporate exodus from New York City and surrounding areas has been amplified by the recent election, increasing the urgency for firms seeking a more favorable and stable business climate,\u201d Ebrahimzadeh said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that New Yorkers prefer the established, exclusive environment of Palm Beach Gardens.\u201d\nRising eight stories, The Modern at Palm Beach Gardens will feature 25,000-square-foot floorplates, the release says. Retail and restaurant components will include a 10,000-square-foot fine dining venue, a 4,000-square-foot casual food and beverage space, and 7,000 square feet of quick service and retail offerings in the garage\u2019s first floor.\nTenant amenities will include a rooftop patio with covered seating, a wet bar, a fitness center with full-service locker rooms, and a media and conference facility.\nPalm Beach Gardens has become a magnet for financial and professional firms relocating from higher-tax markets, Ebrahimzadeh said. Gatsby\u2019s nearby\nDiVosta Towers\nis fully leased with notable tenants such as JPMorgan and Stifel Investment Banking.\nGatsby expects The Modern at Palm Beach Gardens to attract similar demand from financial institutions, private equity firms, law firms and Fortune 500 companies drawn to the area\u2019s quality of life and business climate, Ebrahimzadeh said.\nGatsby\u2019s South Florida office portfolio includes\n800 Brickell\nin Miami, One Town Center in Boca Raton, and 550 Okeechobee in West Palm Beach.",

Its owner, developer Tommy Lin, bought the property earlier this year for $835,000 after it sat abandoned and in disrepair for years.\nThe five-bedroom home in Jamaica Estates was built in 1940 by Trump\u2019s father, Fred, and briefly housed the future developer before the family moved to a larger residence nearby.\nLin spent eight months gut-renovating the roughly 2,500-square-foot house, stripping it to its studs and investing about $500,000 to modernize the interior while keeping its brick-and-stucco fa\u00e7ade intact.\nThe asking price breaks down to $920 per square foot. Brown Harris Stevens\u2019 Jevon Gratineau has the\nlisting\n.\nThis marks another chapter in the property\u2019s colorful resale history.\nIn 2008, before politics were firmly in Trump\u2019s sights, the home traded hands for $782,000.\nIn 2016, investor Michael Davis purchased the home for $1.39 million just hours before Trump\u2019s election night victory, betting that a win would boost its value. He was right: within months, Davis flipped it to a buyer in China for $2.14 million.\nDavis went on to lease the property, at which time he rented out the house on Airbnb for around $800 a night, filling it with Trump memorabilia and even a sign claiming the bedroom might have been where Trump was conceived. He ultimately stopped listing the house in 2017 after the Oxfam charity booked the place and brought refugees to the home to highlight the refugee crisis.\nIn Jamaica Estates, the median home price in September hovered around $1.5 million, according to Realtor.com. A nearby home recently sold for $4 million and several in the neighborhood are listed for more than $3 million.\nWhether the Trump name still adds value remains to be seen.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The\nlitigation\nover the fate of a prized Midtown office building is getting uglier by the day.\nAfter Aby Rosen\u2019s RFR Realty filed a lawsuit this summer regarding the foreclosure auction of 285 Madison Avenue, buyer Ocean West Capital Partners responded last week, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\n\u201cThis litigation is a shakedown,\u201d the firm said in a motion filed to the New York state Supreme Court. Rosen declined to comment to the publication following the motion.\nOcean West is referring to a lawsuit RFR filed in July against Korea-based lender KTB CRE Debt Fund No. 11, aka Daol Asset Management. RFR claimed the April auction of the 27-story property was a \u201ccharade\u201d and \u201crigged.\u201d\nThe lawsuit claimed the lender sabotaged Rosen\u2019s efforts to retain or refinance the building by mismanaging the auction, cutting off lucrative management fees and imposing what RFR called a \u201cparticularly unreasonable\u201d $500,000 deposit requirement to participate.\nThe Class A Madison Avenue building, developed in 1926, was 86 percent leased in 2017 with tenants like General Electric and PVH. That year, Rosen refinanced a $270 million mortgage and extracted $127 million in cash while taking on $120 million in mezzanine debt.\nWhen the CMBS loan matured in 2022, RFR was granted an 18-month extension. But the firm was unable to pay after the second deadline hit. After a foreclosure filing earlier this year, KTB scheduled an auction for April. Rosen made a last-ditch appeal in court that morning, saying he needed more time to find an investor.\nThe judge didn\u2019t go for it, though. Only KTB and RFR showed up to bid. KTB\ntook\npossession of the property for $132 million. The lender then turned around and sold the building to Ocean West.\nRosen\u2019s lawsuit accused KTB of failing to market the property properly and interfering with RFR\u2019s business by terminating its management contract, costing the firm $4 million in annual fees. KTB disputed the claims, noting the sale was advertised widely and that RFR complained about a lack of transparency before even requesting sale materials.\nRosen is seeking unspecified damages. The building, a few blocks from Grand Central and 96 percent leased as of last February, was reappraised at $300 million last summer. Ocean West is planning investments, including a rooftop deck and a gym.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The development would have a parking garage with 353 spaces, and outdoor amenities that include a swimming pool, a courtyard and pedestrian plazas.\nJericho, New York-based Kimco, led by CEO Conor C. Flynn, launched its redevelopment of Oakwood Plaza by demolishing a movie theater on the south side of the shopping center to make way for a\nDick\u2019s Sporting Goods\nstore.\nKimco demolished the movie theater and nearby parking lots at 3800 Oakwood Boulevard earlier this year after the company\u2019s lease agreement with Regal Cinemas expired and the Hollywood City Commission approved a site plan for the Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods store, which will span 120,000 square feet.\nKimco, a real estate investment trust, plans to redevelop Oakwood Plaza over a 30-year period as other commercial leases expire. The shopping center\u2019s three largest tenants are Home Depot, City Furniture and BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club, which collectively occupy a total of 377,295 square feet, according to Kimco\u2019s website.

Another Barton Creek home, a\nHeyl Homes\nconstruction at 4717 Peralta Lane, listed for $5.95 million in April, left the market in June and relisted in September, according to Zillow. It was asking $5.5 million when a deal was struck on Nov. 5.\nThe quick turnaround of 9600 Veletta Place may suggest that\nAustin sellers are adjusting to the buyer\u2019s market shift\n, with overpriced properties gradually giving way to more sober asks on the MLS.\nThe top two deals last week\nwere similarly bifurcated: Both homes were in the same neighborhood, but the first sold in 16 days with an unchanged asking price, while the second had a price cut and over 130 days on market.\n",

        "content": "Andrew Farkas\n\u2019 Island Capital is looking to get in on New York City\u2019s booming hotel market, offering the landmarked Lexington Hotel in Midtown East for sale.\nThe real estate merchant bank and its joint venture partners, Three Wall Capital and MCR, listed the 725-key hotel, eyeing a price of about $275 million,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned. The property is being marketed by Eastdil Secured.\nThe hotel opened in 1929 and was given landmark status in 2016. It boasts a storied past, hosting Hollywood icons Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio during the couple\u2019s brief marriage in the 1950s.\nOnce part of a bustling \u201chotel row\u201d stretching along Lexington Avenue from about 52nd to 45th Street, the corridor has seen its hotel inventory shrink dramatically over the past decade. The former Midtown DoubleTree and Marriott East Side have been repurposed as student housing, and the Midtown East\nMaxwell\nhotel closed in 2020.\nElsewhere in Midtown, the iconic Waldorf Astoria has downsized from 1,400 to 375 rooms and the Roosevelt Hotel will likely be sold and redeveloped as an office tower.\nThe Lexington stands as the last major \u201cbig-box\u201d hotel in the neighborhood, giving potential owners the opportunity to seize on visitors to the surrounding office towers, like JP Morgan Chase\u2019s\nnewly-opened headquarters\none block to the west.\nThe property last changed hands in 2021, when the joint venture\nacquired it for $185 million\n. The hotel had been closed since the pandemic and renovated by its previous owner, DiamondRock Hospitality. It reopened under the Marriott International Autograph Collection brand shortly after.\nThe hotel is hitting the market as New York\u2019s occupancy rates approach pre-pandemic levels and the city\u2019s luxury hotel market surges on the back of rebounding tourism and business travel.\nThe average occupancy rate surpassed 84 percent a week in 2024, up from a pandemic low of about 50 percent, according to a report by Lodging Analytics Research &amp; Consulting. But expenses tied to labor costs, high interest rates and property taxes continue to affect the bottom line.\nEastdil Secured declined to comment.\n",

The extension was secured two months after the debt hit special servicing.\nThe loan transfer was due to \u201cimminent maturity default,\u201d as the debt was set to come due in November. But a representative for Rudin noted at the time that it requested the transfer to allow for negotiations to kick off for a loan modification.\nThose negotiations resulted in a four-year extension, which includes two one-year renewal options, pushing the debt maturity as far back as November 2029. Rudin will also invest $100 million in capital improvements, renovating the lobby, adding an on-site leasing center and elevating the street-level retail.\n\u201cWith this agreement, we will move forward in full confidence with our longstanding business plan, kickstarting an exciting new chapter for one of Downtown New York\u2019s most important and iconic buildings,\u201d Rudin president Neil Gupta said in a statement.\nAn Iron Hound Management team including Chris Herron, Kevin Thompson and Anthony D\u2019Amelio advised the landlord on the debt restructuring.\nRudin bought the former AT&amp;T headquarters in 1999 for $150 million and invested $100 million into the building, which was near full occupancy a decade ago. But occupancy\ndropped sharply\nonce the pandemic began and was at only 57 percent as of June, according to Fitch Ratings.\nCenturyLink Communications downsized significantly in 2021; Dentsu Holdings USA also downsized and ultimately relocated that same; and iHeartMedia division AMFM Operating also moved locations when its lease expired in 2022.\nRemaining tenants at the 28-story, 1.2-million-square-foot building include Dorilton and Industrious, which\nsigned a 52,000-square-foot lease\nfor the 13th floor back in 2021.\nIn 2015, Rudin borrowed $425 million to refinance the property with a CMBS-backed loan underwritten by JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The individual sales ranged in price from $8.5 million to $11 million per acre, or an average of about $790,000 per home lot and $9.7 million per acre.\n\u201cOur third quarter performance was underpinned by resilient home buyer and builder demand at the Great Park, which remains solid despite continuing pressure from higher interest rates and affordability headwinds,\u201d FivePoint CEO Dan Hedigan said on a third-quarter earnings call last month. \u201cWhile buyers remain somewhat cautious, the underlying imbalance between housing supply and demand in this core California market continues to support our land sale activity.\u201d\nIn the last quarter, builders sold 187 homes at the Great Park Neighborhoods, up from 112 in the second quarter.\nFivePoint\n, developer for the Great Park, has six actively selling programs expected to sell out by early next year, with an additional 10 new programs anticipated to begin sales either later this year or early next year.\nCurrently, sales are ongoing at Luna Park, the eighth community to open for occupancy at the Great Park Neighborhoods since the development opened in 2013. Homes in Luna Park start at about $1.2 million with larger homes fetching as much as $2.5 million.\nOverall, more than 7,000 homes and 9,000 home sites have sold at the Great Park Neighborhoods since it opened. The development is currently entitled for 10,500 homes.\nStill, while FivePoint was able to sell land at Great Park last quarter, the Irvine developer didn\u2019t close any land sales at Valencia, its other master-planned development near Six Flags in Santa Clarita; it hasn\u2019t sold any land there in about a year.

        "content": "Two of Chicago\u2019s more colorful real estate figures are squaring off in court over the former Rainforest Cafe site in River North.\nAlecko Lending, led by founder\nAlexander Pissios\n, filed a foreclosure lawsuit Monday against a Sean Conlon-led entity that owns 605 North Clark Street, alleging it defaulted on an $8.3 million bridge loan and now owes more than $9.2 million, including default interest and fees.\nThe suit seeks foreclosure, the appointment of a receiver and a deficiency judgment, while also waiving the borrower\u2019s right to redeem the property after a judgment is entered.\nBut Conlon, the investor behind the borrower known in part for starring on CNBC show \u201cThe Deed: Chicago,\u201d brushed off the suit as premature.\nWhile he said he doesn\u2019t blame the lender for being frustrated, he claims he has been paying penalty interest since June and intends to repay Alecko the full debt with proceeds from a refinancing he\u2019s planning.\nConlon owns other real estate in Texas, North Carolina and\nWest Palm Beach\nthat he suggested could be used as collateral in the upcoming refinancing, without specifying the amount of the loan he intends to borrow.\n\u201cWe were supposed to refinance in June,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve paid late fees, and we\u2019re close to finalizing a global refinance across all our assets \u2014 tens of millions.\u201d\nHe still believes in the River North property\u2019s long-term value, but acknowledged the Chicago market has been \u201ca nightmare.\u201d A controversial city decision to\nallow a cannabis retailer to open up\ninside the 22,000-square-foot former restaurant building blew up.\nThe would-be tenant, Progressive Treatment Solutions, backed out of leasing the space last year amid neighborhood backlash, including \u201clitigation, uncertainty and additional costs,\u201d its attorney said at the time. Plus, there was an earlier revelation that it was\ntoo close to other dispensaries\nto comply with state law.\nConlon said his side may bring suit against Progressive stemming from its retreat, while also claiming he has \u201cso much equity\u201d in the property. He bought it with another investor, Joe Scoby, for $13.7 million in 2013.\nPissios, who sold the film and TV studio Cinespace Chicago in a $1 billion deal in 2021 and has since pivoted into hard-nosed lending, has a growing track record of snapping up distressed real estate \u2014 and he isn\u2019t shy about using the courts to seize collateral.\nHis Alecko vehicle this year bought a River North office property at\n620 North LaSalle Drive\nout of distress for $7.4 million. Pissios also bought a Fulton Market building at\n232 North Carpenter Street\nfor $11 million in 2022, and he\u2019s known to move fast when borrowers miss payments.\nAlecko and its representatives didn\u2019t return requests for comment. Pissios gained notoriety in Chicago for helping federal law enforcement officers nail union boss\nJohn T. Coli\n, who was sentenced to 19 months in prison in 2022, by secretly recording their conversations. Pissios was trying to avoid a bankruptcy fraud charge at the time he began cooperating with authorities.\nConlon insisted his record is clean.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never not paid back a loan,\u201d he said. \u201cNot going to change at this age \u2014 I\u2019m 56, going on 80.\u201d\nHowever, Conlon was part of the borrower entity that faces a\n$6.4 million foreclosure lawsuit\nfor the 41,000-square-foot office building at 401 West Ontario Street, which is now set to be sold out of receivership for more than $5 million to an entity led by Chicago-based Drew Friestedt\u2019s Monroe Residential Partners, federal court records filed earlier this month show.\nThe 605 North Clark site, home to the kitschy Rainforest Cafe from 1997 until it shuttered in 2020, has long been seen as a redevelopment target. But with litigation now clouding its future and a lender pushing for a forced sale, its fate could hinge on whether Conlon can close his refinancing in time.\n\u201cThis is a tempest in a teacup,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a seasoned pro. Chicago will find its feet. And I still believe in owning Rainforest.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Goldman Sachs unloaded an office property near Goose Island for less than half what it spent to buy the site.\nAn affiliate of the New York-based investment giant sold the three-story, 100,600-square-foot office building at 1400 North Kingsbury Street for just under $11.2 million to a joint venture between Chicago developer R2 and local investor Peppercorn Capital, according to Cook County records\nreported\nby Crain\u2019s.\nThe price equates to $111 per square foot. Cushman &amp; Wakefield brokers Cody Hundertmark and Tom Sitz represented the sellers.\nThe deal follows Goldman\u2019s $19.5 million sale last year of the adjacent REI store at\n1422 North Kingsbury\nto a California buyer.\nThe combined $30.7 million deals represent a steep loss for Goldman, which teamed with R2 in 2015 to acquire and redevelop the two buildings for about $50 million, including renovations and tenant improvements.\nR2\nheld a minority stake in the partnership at the time. Despite generating steady income over the years, the sale highlights malaise in Chicago\u2019s office sector, where elevated borrowing costs, and soft investor appetite have hammered values.\nThe Kingsbury deal illustrates the painful math facing some landlords looking to sell in a market still contending with high vacancies since the pandemic. Goldman declined to comment on its decision to exit the properties.\nR2 CEO Matt Garrison told the outlet that his firm, now in a 50-50 joint venture with Peppercorn, views the building as a solid long-term bet.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great building in a niche neighborhood with tight office supply that\u2019s being decreased by residential conversions,\u201d Garrison said. \u201cWe like the demand story, the cost structure and the product-market fit of loft offices and want to own more of them.\u201d\nThe property, which includes a 44-space parking lot at 1301 North Kingsbury, was nearly full when Goldman and R2 bought it, anchored by staffing firm Seaton. That tenant left for the Old Post Office just before the pandemic, prompting a $9.4 million round of upgrades led by Cushman &amp; Wakefield. Core Spaces signed a 10-year lease last year for 36,000 square feet, helping lift occupancy to roughly 73 percent.\nPeppercorn\u2019s Phil Denny, who has mostly focused on the\nWest Loop\nand the\nKinzie Industrial Corridor\n, said he\u2019s betting on momentum across neighborhoods, pointing to recent leasing gains and a pickup in activity around Fulton Market.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A North Texas master-planned community formerly known as EPIC City is casting out its name in hopes of squashing confusion around its rollout.\nDeveloper Community Capital Partners rebranded the 402-acre project spanning Collin and Hunt counties as The Meadow, a move it says better reflects the site\u2019s character and family-focused design, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nThe name change follows \u201cpublic confusion\u201d over whether EPIC City was meant to form its own municipality, representatives for the Plano-based firm told the outlet. In a statement, Community Capital Partners said the name change sought to \u201cbetter describe the beautiful property and the inclusive, family-centered, mixed-use, master-planned community being designed.\u201d\nPlans for The Meadow, about 40 miles northeast of downtown Dallas, include more than 1,000 homes, senior and assisted-living facilities, apartments, a community college, a mosque, a K\u201312 faith-based school, retail, medical clinics and athletic fields.\nCommunity Capital Partners is a for-profit venture founded by members of the East Plano Islamic Center, one of the region\u2019s largest mosques.\nThe rebrand follows months of political heat. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and other top Republicans have called for\ninvestigations\ninto the project, citing potential securities violations and discrimination concerns.\nPaxton last month accused the developers of breaking federal and state securities laws, though he didn\u2019t specify which ones, and said he was considering legal action pending a referral from the State Securities Board.\nOther probes have fizzled. In September, the Texas Workforce Commission\nsettled\na Fair Housing Act complaint against the developers. The U.S. Department of Justice dropped its\ncivil rights inquiry\nin June, which it had opened after Sen. John Cornyn raised concerns that the project might exclude non-Muslim residents.\nGov. Greg Abbott\nhas said as many as a dozen state agencies are still looking into \u201cpotential illegal activities\u201d tied to the development.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Lower Manhattan\u2019s residential conversion boom isn\u2019t driving office tenants out\u2026 it\u2019s locking them in.\nOffice users displaced by the wave of conversions are largely staying downtown, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The activity is fueling a leasing surge even as the neighborhood\u2019s total office stock shrinks, according to a JLL report.\nOverall, leasing in the area this year is already more than twice last year\u2019s total. Available space is tightening as more properties are slated for residential makeovers.\nSince 2020, more than 5.5 million square feet of downtown office space has been converted to housing; another 5.8 million square feet could face the same fate, according to JLL. Yet rather than decamping for Midtown or Brooklyn, most tenants are simply hopping to other Lower Manhattan buildings.\n\u201cThe tenants that are or were in the buildings that are getting converted have become an important part of the current leasing velocity,\u201d Rosenberg &amp; Estis attorney Michael Lefkowitz told the publication.\nThe rash of conversions stems from New York\u2019s 467m tax incentive program, which offers property tax breaks to owners converting outdated office buildings into apartments. The program\u2019s deadlines \u2014 start by 2031, finish by 2039, steeper benefits for earlier starts \u2014 create pressure for developers to move fast, forcing tenants to vacate with little notice.\nThe result is a game of musical chairs in which law firms, engineers and other professional tenants are snapping up remaining Class A space nearby.\nEngineering firm Arup and law firm Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard &amp; Smith both\nlanded\nat Union Investment\u2019s 140 Broadway after being displaced from\n77 Water Street\n, which Vanbarton Group plans to turn into 650 rentals. Rents there range from $65 to $79 per square foot, compared to $46 to $56 at 77 Water, per CoStar.\nJLL\u2019s John Wheeler said the shuffle hasn\u2019t meant trading down. \u201cThat\u2019s a good example where they traded up in the quality of the building,\u201d he said.\nStill, tenants are wary of moving into buildings that could face the same conversion fate.\n\u201cYou\u2019re typically not looking to jump from the frying pan into the fire,\u201d Wheeler told Crain\u2019s. \u201cPart of their choice is to be comfortable that they\u2019re not gonna just move in and be recreating the same cycle again.\u201d\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "An incomplete estate on Indian Creek just hit the market asking $200 million, making it Miami-Dade County\u2019s most expensive listing.\nThat also makes it, by extension, among the priciest homes on the market in the U.S. The sellers of the nearly 28,000-square-foot home at 7 Indian Creek Island Road are Dr. Aaron Rollins, a cosmetic surgeon, and his wife, Marine Rollins, a real estate agent with Miami Global Realty, according to the Wall Street Journal. Dr. Rollins is a liposuction specialist, and the creator of AirSculpt, a body contouring procedure that involves fat removal.\nJill,\nDanny\nand Hillary Hertzberg with the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker Realty have the listing.\nThe Rollinses hired Ontario-based Ferris Rafauli to design the sprawling, waterfront compound, which is under construction. Plans for the mansion include nine bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, four half-bathrooms, spa facilities, a salon, theater, library, jazz lounge and a 1,500-gallon aquarium. The estate will also have a pool, a 135-foot dock and 200 feet of waterfront.\nThey bought the property from singer-songwriter Julio Iglesias for\n$30 million\nin 2020. They also own a waterfront home in the Venetian Islands on a property they bought for\n$4.3 million\nin 2016.\nIf it sells anywhere near the asking price, the Indian Creek estate would set a record for single-family home sales in Miami-Dade County. The current record was set in March when billionaire developer Vlad Doronin sold his Star Island estate in Miami Beach for\n$120 million\n. The Florida record for home sales was set in April when the billionaire DeGroote family sold their waterfront Naples estate for\n$225 million\n.\nIndian Creek has seen its share of pricey deals and high-profile buyers. Billionaire Jeff Bezos\ndropped $234 million\non a trio of homes on the island last year. In June, a vacant lot neighboring his property sold for\n$105 million\n. Known as the \u201cBillionaire Bunker,\u201d Indian Creek is also home to Tom Brady, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, DJ David Guetta, developer Jeffrey Soffer, and billionaires Carl Icahn and Eddie Lampert.\nThe Rollins\u2019 estate is the latest trophy listing in South Florida\u2019s booming ultra-luxury market. The pandemic triggered a massive wealth migration to the region that fueled demand for homes priced at $50 million or more. With the busy season approaching, the region\u2019s most expensive homes are debuting on the market. Last week, an oceanfront teardown in Palm Beach hit the market asking $185 million.\nSpec developer Todd Glaser and his partners bought a 2.3-acre waterfront North Bay Road property for $105 million in July, which they have relisted for $169 million. They plan to build an\nestate asking $300 million\n.",

The seller was an affiliate of San Francisco-based Grosvenor Properties, which owned the property for at least three decades.\nThe price for the 86-unit property works out to about $371,000 per unit.\nThe deal marks the third multifamily acquisition between local firm Ballast and Washington, D.C.-based Carlyle. The firms\nbought 1425 Taylor Street for $14.3 million and 1900 Washington Street for $11.6 million\nin June. The purchases totaled 74 units at $350,000 per unit.\nResidential rental rates in San Francisco, already one of the country\u2019s most-expensive markets, ticked up in recent months.\nThe city had the strongest annual rent growth in the country this summer. By this August, the city\u2019s rental market had\nrecovered the price losses\nbrought on by the pandemic, according to Zumper.\nThe following month,\nrents exceeded pre-pandemic rates\n. Rent growth for a two-bedroom apartment was up 17.1 percent year-over-year, while one-bedroom rents were up 10.7 percent.\nThe increase in rents is attributable to return-to-office mandates, as well as an influx of residents working in the\nbooming artificial intelligence sector\n.\nAs a result, capital partners like Carlyle have been warming back up to San Francisco. Besides Caryle, other institutional investors like Fortress Investment Group, Hines and DivcoWest have also gotten back into the market.\nGrosvenor Court is a \u201cclassic San Francisco multifamily\u201d property that is \u201cpositioned for growth in a recovering market,\u201d Ballast co-founder and CEO Greg MacDonald said of the latest acquisition.\nBallast has more than 7,700 units in its portfolio nationwide. Earlier this year, the San Francisco-based firm was selected by a receiver to manage the Parkmerced, the largest multifamily property in the city with 3,221 units.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Abacus Capital broke ground on its Palm Beach Gardens apartment project after nabbing a $77.5 million construction loan.\nAffiliates of Beverly Hills, California-based Kennedy Wilson and Toronto-based Fairfax Financial provided the financing for Arbor House, a planned 13-story building with 302 units and an eight-story garage with 480 parking spaces at 3701 Catalfumo Way South, records show.\nA JLL team led by Mona Carlton and Joshua Odessky arranged the loan on behalf of New York-based Abacus Capital, led by CEO Ben Friedman.\nAbacus Capital is developing Arbor House on a 4.7-acre site acquired last year for\n$32.5 million\nfrom Palm Beach Gardens-based\nCatalfumo Companies\nled by Daniel Catalfumo. The property is within the 37.6-acre PGA Station, a mixed-use community being master developed by Catalfumo.\nUltimately, PGA Station will have 1,016 apartments; a 122-key hotel; 16,000 square feet of retail; 12,500 square feet of restaurant space; and 468,000 square feet of office space. PGA Station will include\nThe Modern at Palm Beach Gardens\n, a mixed-use building featuring 220,000 square feet of office, retail and restaurant space being developed by Miami-based Gatsby Florida, led by co-founders Isaac Shalom and\nBabak Ebrahimzadeh\n.\nIn June and July, Abacus Capital demolished two office buildings that were on the Arbor House development site. General contractor Seawood Builders recently filed a notice of commencement to begin construction of the multifamily project, records show.\nDesigned by Coral Gables-based Corwill Architects, Arbor House will have a mix of studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments. About 10 percent of the units will be set aside as workforce housing for tenants earning up to 120 percent of the area median income in Palm Beach County, which is $104,000.\nAccording to JLL,\nPalm Beach Gardens\nhas experienced minimal multifamily development since 2019, and market-rate asking rents have increased 41 percent since 2020 to an average of $2,671 a month.\nFounded in 2004, Abacus Capital focuses on developing and buying multifamily properties, according to the firm\u2019s website. The company has $4.8 billion in assets under management.",

That\u2019s off five contracts and nearly 40 percent in volume from a year ago, according to the\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n. The report, compiled by Marcy Roth, counts properties listed publicly at $4 million or more.\nOn the supply side of the equation, active listings, 74 properties enter the market to bring the total to 1,331 homes available for sale.\n\u201cSmart sellers and buyers\u201d are still active in the market, but most are now on the \u201csidelines, waiting for the holiday season to pass,\u201d Roth noted.\nLast week\u2019s top home to go into contract, based on asking price, was 25430 Prado De Azul in Calabasas. It was placed on the market for just under $10 million in July before that was shaved to the last asking price of $9.9 million, or $1,577 per square foot.\nThe Agency\u2019s Emil Hartoonian and Ellie Hartoonian hold the listing on behalf of seller Kevin Krivitsky, according to property records.\nKrivitsky purchased the home in June of last year for $7.8 million, or $1,245 per square foot.\nThe five-bed, six-bath home spans 6,300 square feet and sits on nearly half an acre.\nAmong the highlights are floor-to-ceiling pocket doors leading to the backyard, a home theater, TVs inside and outside, infinity pool and outdoor dining.\nLast week\u2019s second-largest home to go into contract, based on listing price, was in the Beverly Hills Flats, at 634 North Sierra Drive. The last asking price was $9.5 million, or $2,168 per square foot.\nKeller Williams Beverly Hills\u2019 Gregg Silver and Dafna Milstein are the listing agents on the five-bed, five-bath property.\nThe seller is a trust with trustees that include Diane Bishop and Lauren Campbell, according to property records.\nThe 1952-built home is 4,400 square feet and sits on a 20,000-square-foot lot. It has a circular driveway with a detached three-car garage, according to the listing. It has a pool and built-in grill in the backyard.\n",

The expansion will include an outdoor pool on a lot adjacent to the house at 1871 North Burling Street. Von Weise Associates is listed as the architect, and Savane Design + Build will handle construction.\nThe Gusts\u2019 property is part of the\nBurling-Orchard-Howe\nenclave of mansions that has defined the upper-tier of\nLincoln Park\nfor nearly two decades. In 1998, the couple paid $1.19 million for the parcel, later building the 6,200-square-foot mansion. In 2016, they acquired the lot to the north after buying out all six condos in a small building for $2.95 million.\nNow they\u2019re expanding to the south lot where the addition will rise. The three parcels total roughly three-tenths of an acre.\nHow much they\u2019ve invested in the estate is hard to pin down, but available records suggest the owners have spent at least $8.1 million between land purchases and the construction permit, likely much more when factoring in earlier building costs and any undisclosed lot acquisitions.\nThe Cook County Assessor last valued the core mansion and its original lot at $5.34 million.\nThe project reinforces Burling Street\u2019s reputation as one of Chicago\u2019s concentrated luxury corridors, where recent sales have topped\n$10 million\nincluding the\nRichard and Michaela Parrillo\nestate that fetched $15.2 million last year.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Pricing is reportedly in the $100 million neighborhood, people familiar with the deal told the publication, which would come to roughly $300,000 per unit.\nThe San Francisco rental market has been bouncing back in the past year after a pandemic crash, with median rents\nsurpassing pre-pandemic prices\nin September. As of early this year, Baupost reportedly had $23 billion under management, including a large number of apartments in San Francisco acquired in the years before the pandemic. Tech employees moving into the city to work for one of the many burgeoning artificial intelligence companies have simultaneously\nhelped drive up rental rates\nand apartment demand.\nVeritas\n, the owner of the roughly 300-unit apartment portfolio before Prado and Baupost, started defaulting on debt tied to portfolios of apartments in San Francisco during the pandemic. Prado and Baupost teamed up to\nacquire the nonperforming debt\nand ultimately agreed to\nbecome the new owners of the apartments in November 2023\n.\nThe two firms are now looking to sell off those apartment buildings. Veritas recently received a notice of default for a $570 million loan backed by another portfolio of approximately 1,500 apartments in San Francisco. The firm has said it plans to bring on a new investor to avoid foreclosure on the properties.\nIn the two years since taking over the 17 buildings hitting the market, Prado and Baupost have invested in improving the portfolio of properties, including taking care of issues like deferred maintenance. Now that the work on the apartments is complete, the firms are looking to offload them.\nAt the same time, Prado is working on various redevelopment projects across the city, including residences at 3333 California Street and California Pacific Medical Center\u2019s former Presidio Heights campus.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

NJBIZ\nreported\n. The project is expected to span 1.6 million square feet and replace a lot that\u2019s been vacant for nearly two decades.\nThe full-block site, also known as 111 First Street, began as the site for P. Lorillard Tobacco Company\u2019s warehouse after the conclusion of the Civil War. That factory shut down in 1956 and the site ultimately became an artist community before its demolition, according to\nJerseyDigs\n.\nThe height is the most jaw-dropping element of the proposal. Plans call for two towers rising from a single podium base. One would be 40 stories tall, while the other would be a whopping 90 stories tall; a 40th-floor sky bridge would connect the two.\nIn total, the development would check in at 1,055 feet tall. That would represent the fourth-tallest residential column in both the region and the entire country, according to BLDG, not to mention the tallest in Jersey City.\nPelli Clarke &amp; Partners is designing the project, which would include 20 percent of units set aside for affordable housing. There will also be 29,000 square feet of amenities and ground-floor retail space.\nThe project is also expected to provide \u201cabundant\u201d parking options to residents, according to the developer. Just in case those spaces aren\u2019t plentiful enough, there will be three PATH stations, one ferry depot and two Light Rail stops, all less than a mile away.\nBLDG has yet to submit an application to Jersey City, meaning the Planning Board still needs to approve the proposal before construction commences.\nShould the project come to fruition, BLDG will have plenty of skyline-shaping company in Jersey City\u2019s multifamily market.\nA joint venture of SJP Properties, Claremont Development and Battery Global Advisors is\ndeveloping The Lucy\nat 619 Grove Street, a 23-story, 444-unit project.\nThe Namdar Group\u2019s projects at 29 Van Reipen Avenue and 612 Pavonia Avenue in Jersey City are expected to\ndeliver more than 1,100 units\nto the Journal Square neighborhood.\nAnd Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies\nprovided a $515 million loan\nfor Kushner Companies\u2019 One Journal Square, which opened to residents several months ago and spans 2 million square feet across two 52-story towers, containing 1,723 units.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The firm has no immediate plans to redevelop the golf course, the source said.\nThe sprawling site at 2470 Greenview Cove Drive has been fraught with controversy and failed redevelopment attempts.\nVeterinarian Scott Swerdlin, who owns Palm Beach Equine Clinic, bought the golf course from\nStraub\nfor $16 million in 2019. Straub\u2019s struggles to win redevelopment approvals led to years of neglect, frustrating residents whose multimillion-dollar homes overlooked the once-pristine greens, published reports state.\nStraub\nblamed the village of Wellington and Palm Beach Polo Property Owners Association for his decision to cease property maintenance of the golf course. Village records detailed 73 municipal citations issued to Straub between 2003 and 2019 for property upkeep, building permit issues and other violations.\nIn 2022, Swerdlin attempted a land use amendment to pave the way for new housing, proposing up to 125 single-family homes, but the plan failed to gain traction, village records show.\nBH has one of the most active real estate investment and development pipelines in South Florida. The firm and partner Gold Standard of Care recently picked up Sterling Aventura, a 171-unit senior living facility in Aventura, at a deep discount of\n$36.9 million\n. The joint venture paid Blackstone $12 million for Sterling Aventura. In 2017, Blackstone paid $48.9 million for the property.\nAlso near Aventura, BH and Lennar are redeveloping a shuttered 104.3-acre golf course into\nGreenview at Presidential Estates\n, a luxury 103-single-family home community.BH is also collaborating with other developers such as the Related Group, Dezer Development and Kolter Group on luxury condominium projects across South Florida, including a planned Ritz-Carlton branded tower in\nWest Palm Beach\n.",

The additional homes would largely rise in parts of the Great Park Neighborhoods that were previously slated to host office, retail and other commercial development.\nFivePoint pivoted to more housing \u201cin response to current market demands.\u201d It will also assist in addressing housing needs, the firm said.\nThe City of Irvine is required to plan for 23,610 new homes by 2029 as part of its\nhousing element\n.\nThe Great Park Neighborhoods opened its first community in 2013 and has been one of the country\u2019s top-selling master-planned projects, with builders reporting more than 7,000 home sales.\nFivePoint has already sold over 9,000 lots, averaging about $790,000 each.\nIf those prices hold, the new entitlements could unlock nearly $1 billion in future lot sales, more than double FivePoint\u2019s current market cap of roughly $410 million.\nThe developer has gradually expanded its residential scope over the years. The project\u2019s initial plan called for 4,894 homes before the city increased that figure in 2013 in exchange for FivePoint taking on more responsibility for managing the megadevelopment.\nAlongside the latest entitlement request filed with the city, FivePoint has plans for 1,184 housing units across 191 acres. About 691 homes have already been approved. In order to fit the housing in, the developer would cut 755,000 square feet from its commercial pipeline, leaving 3.7 million square feet of office and other nonresidential uses still entitled.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The group voted in support of Masterplan\u2019s proposal, which is being designed in collaboration with Newport Beach-based Brandon Architects.\nPlans call for 50 or fewer for-sale units, including a two-story penthouse.\nUnits will range from 2,100 to 3,900 square feet, with the penthouse sprawling 8,000 square feet and featuring six bedrooms, a private pool and outdoor lounge.\nThe building\u2019s second level would serve as an amenity deck, with a 2,600-square-foot club, pool and spa, as well as a 3,000-square-foot fitness center alongside more than 10,000 square feet of outdoor space.\nThe 31,000-square-foot development site at 3618 Gillespie Street is surrounded by rental townhomes fetching about $4,000 a month.\nMasterplan\nCEO Dallas Cothrum told the outlet that the property owner is ready to sell when the project advances, describing the planned tower as \u201cvery luxurious\u201d and a step up in sophistication for Turtle Creek. The project would have about 120 parking spaces across three underground levels.\nZoning approval is the next hurdle. The site is zoned for low-rise multifamily. Cothrum said his team plans to file a zoning case later this month, with hopes of appearing before the City Plan Commission early next year.\nIf it moves forward, One Welborn would join a growing cluster of upscale condo developments reshaping\nTurtle Creek\n.

        "content": "One year ago, the City Council upended how apartments are rented in New York City.\nOn November 13, 2024, the Council\napproved\nthe Fairness in Apartment Rental Expenses (FARE) Act, a measure that banned forcing tenants to pay fees for rental brokers they did not hire.\nThe bill\u2019s approval was the culmination of years of efforts to reform a system that often cost tenants thousands of extra dollars to secure an apartment. Proponents of the FARE Act argued that this dynamic gave landlords more leverage to raise rents at lease renewal, knowing that tenants likely wanted to avoid those upfront costs.\nOpponents, including the Real Estate Board of New York,\nhave blamed the law\nfor rising rents and the disappearance of public listings, as owners push the cost of broker fees to tenants and try to avoid the appearance of hiring a broker. The group is awaiting a federal appeals court decision on\nits legal challenge to the law\n.\nThis week marks one year since the bill\u2019s passage, and seven months since the law went into effect.\nHere\u2019s how the law has played out so far:\nListing Volume\nDespite the industry\u2019s outcry over the law, the consequences haven\u2019t been as clear-cut as some predicted.\nWithin 24 hours of its adoption, more than 1,000 listings\ndropped from StreetEasy\n, as agents and landlords scrambled to rewrite contracts and revise their listings to comply with the new rules.\nBut a month later, the platform published a report stating that the drastic dip was short-lived. By the end of June, daily inventory on the site had increased more than 4 percent since the beginning of the month, an uptick that was only slightly lower than the change during the same time period last year.\nStill, rental listings on the portal declined annually for each month since the FARE Act passed, according to data from StreetEasy. Inventory fell 6 percent in July, 8 percent in August, 6 percent in September and 7 percent in October.\nHowever, the decreases in inventory are likely the result of multiple factors, not just the new law.\n\u201cWhile the FARE Act may have had some impact, the combination of low supply and high demand is what is primarily driving these trends that we have seen at play for several years,\u201d said StreetEasy senior economist Kenny Lee.\nCompetition for apartments has been increasing for the last two years, Lee added, as more companies called their employees back to work and higher mortgage rates kept some potential home buyers in the rental market.\nBut on REBNY\u2019s residential listing service, the declines following the FARE Act are more pronounced. Data from the trade group shows inventory dropped 12 percent year-over-year in June, followed by declines of 16 percent, 20 percent, 23 percent and 32 percent in each of the months after.\nLast October, more than 2,000 listings for apartments in Manhattan hit the RLS, but last month, that number dropped to less than 500, according to UrbanDigs co-founder John Walkup.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where that volume is going,\u201d said Walkup. \u201cThey\u2019re still being listed for rent somewhere, somehow,\u201d he added, referring to other listing websites.\nWalkup added that the decline is likely more pronounced because the RLS only captures properties marketed by agents with exclusive agreements with landlords, which are likely in shorter supply now that landlords are responsible for paying them. As a result, the apartments available on the RLS skew toward the higher end of the rental market, where landlords are better able to absorb the cost of hiring an agent bc of the rent charge.\nBut both factors have made it tough for someone like Walkup, whose company relies on data from the RLS, to\nmake heads or tails\nof the rental market.\n\u201cAs well-intended as [the law] was, it has thrown a lot of confusion into the ranks,\u201d Walkup said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you if it\u2019s cheaper to rent an apartment, but I can tell you that if you\u2019re renting an apartment in Manhattan . . . the face values are a lot higher than they were a year ago.\u201d\nFollowing the passage of the FARE Act,\nmedian rents rose\n, though not dramatically, on a month-to-month basis, according to an analysis of StreetEasy data by\nThe Real Deal\n. In June 2025, the median rent for listings on the listing platform was $4,000, a 2.6 percent increase from the previous month and a 5.2 percent jump year over year. The rate increased another .7 percent in July, representing a 6 percent increase from the previous year.\nThe median rate stayed flat the next month and decreased .8 percent in September (still 7.2 percent higher than September 2024) and dropped another 1.1 percent in October. At $3,950, the median rent in October 2025 was 8.2 percent higher than the same month last year.\n\u201cWith vacancy rates expected to stay low, the pace of rent growth will stay elevated this year and next,\u201d said StreetEasy\u2019s Lee.\nBrokerage business\nWhile the debate over how the FARE Act will impact renters\u2019 wallets continues, it has become clear that the pie has gotten smaller for brokerages and agents.\n\u201cA lot of the open listing, tenant rep agents, their business has really suffered as a result of the FARE Act,\u201d Living New York co-founder Devin Someck said. Open listings, in which multiple brokerages were signed up to show the same rental unit, often came with the tenant covering the broker\u2019s fee, a practice prohibited under the FARE Act.\nSomeck, whose firm works as both a landlord rep and property manager, said that he\u2019s seen a swell of agents \u201cseeking a kind of refuge\u201d at this firm because of its strong landlord relationships.\nHe said his portfolio, which used to be split between listings where the owner pays and the tenant pays, now falls entirely under the owner pays category due to the law. He added that he\u2019s seen larger shops pull back from the leasing business as profit margins have narrowed as a result of landlords scaling back their commission payments.\nAt the same time, leasing agents have also seen their commission volumes suffer as landlords more aggressively pursue renewals rather than pay out broker fees, according to Someck.\nJennifer Nobis, an agent with Bond New York, said that she still has landlord clients who are holding units off the market, unsure if they will try to rent out the apartments themselves or sell instead.\n\u201cFor smaller landlords, the margin isn\u2019t there,\u201d she said.\nThat applies doubly to rent-stabilized units, which have already been struggling after the passage of the 2019 Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act took away many of the levers landlords could pull to increase rents in their rent-stabilized properties, according to Bohemia Realty CEO Sarah Saltzberg.\n\u201cThe owners that are losing money across the board on this asset type are certainly not looking to spend money that they don\u2019t have to,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if they can save a one-month broker fee, they will, and they\u2019ll just say, \u2018Find a way to get me a tenant another way.\u2019 \u201d\nSaltzberg says that she had already shifted her brokerage business away from rent-stabilized properties after 2019, but that the FARE Act further drove her to focus on exclusive landlord relationships.\n\u201cAny open listings that we worked on, or limited listings, it\u2019s almost impossible to service those listings, because how do you let people know about them,\u201d Saltzberg said.\nIt has also meant that she can\u2019t use her shop as a training ground for up-and-coming agents who used to be able to cut their teeth on open listings, admitting that her firm has gotten smaller as she\u2019s reoriented hiring towards experienced agents that can maintain valuable landlord connections.\n\u201cThe old rule used to be, you\u2019d have 20 percent of your agents making 80 percent of the revenue,\u201d Saltzberg said. \u201cNow we have a smaller team, but almost every single person is making real money.\u201d\nLegal fight\nREBNY wasted no time filing a legal challenge to the FARE Act.\nOne month after its passage, the trade group\nfiled a lawsuit\nin federal court, alleging, among other things, that the law violates the First Amendment rights of brokers and landlords because it discourages the publishing of rental listings. Under the FARE Act, a broker who advertises a rental is assumed to have been hired by the landlord.\nThe city, which is the target of the lawsuit, maintains that the law doesn\u2019t \u201cbar the publication of anything by anyone,\u201d but sets ground rules for listings published with the blessing of a landlord.\nJust one day before the law went into effect, Judge Ronnie Abrams\ndelivered\na major blow to the group: Not only did she refuse to pause the new rules, but she dismissed a majority of REBNY\u2019s claims.\nShe threw out the First Amendment claim and another that the FARE Act is preempted by state law. REBNY\u2019s allegation that the law defies the Contract Clause survived, though Abrams cast doubt on the claim outweighing the law\u2019s \u201csignificant and legitimate public purpose.\u201d\nAbrams also denied REBNY\u2019s subsequent request to halt the law while it pursued an appeal.\nREBNY\nappealed\nto the Second Circuit, which also rejected its request to pause the FARE Act. The group is waiting for a decision on its appeal of Abrams\u2019 dismissal of the First Amendment claim.\nIn court filings, the city has argued that reversing the law at this point would \u201ccreate chaos.\u201d\nREBNY has long held that the law is bad for both brokers and tenants. For the latter, the group has warned that the law would result in fewer public listings and drive up rents.\n\u201cThe longer this law is in effect, the longer consumers and owners are going to be adversely affected,\u201d said Carl Hum, vice president and general counsel at REBNY.\nHum said brokers are still navigating the law\u2019s gray areas, including what constitutes conditioning rental of a unit on hiring a broker, which is barred under the FARE Act. Dual agency \u2014\u00a0where a broker represents a tenant and a landlord \u2014\u00a0is still permitted, but a broker can\u2019t publish a listing on behalf of a landlord and then collect a fee from the tenant who leases the apartment advertised.\nWhat\u2019s next\nIf the Second Circuit upholds the lower court\u2019s dismissal of REBNY\u2019s claims, the trade group could petition the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the case. The country\u2019s highest court receives, on average, between 7,000 and 8,000 petitions each year but only hears about 80 cases.\nThe group could also seek legislative changes, though it seems unlikely that there would be much appetite to do so under the City Council or new mayoral administration.\nBrooklyn Council member Chi Oss\u00e9, the FARE Act\u2019s lead sponsor, isn\u2019t concerned about the case.\n\u201cThey already lost when we passed this law, and they\u2019ve lost in court at every turn since,\u201d Oss\u00e9 said in an email. \u201cWe\u2019ve beaten them once, and we\u2019ll beat them again.\u201d\nHe said the FARE Act shifted power back to tenants when negotiating lease renewals with their landlord. Tenants typically paid 15 percent of the annual cost of rent to the broker, adding thousands of dollars to the cost of moving.\n\u201cBefore the FARE Act, tenants at lease renewal faced two options: stay and swallow the new rent or leave and take a huge hit in upfront costs,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the end of forced broker fees, bargaining power is now in the hands of tenants at renewal, and that shift will put downward pressure on rents across the city.\u201d\nOss\u00e9 said he\u2019s confident that Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani will help strengthen the law and ramp up enforcement. The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection has received 1,125 complaints since June 11, according to Brick Underground. Oss\u00e9 said that most of these complaints didn\u2019t include enough information for city officials to take action and believes the City Council could help educate tenants about what kind of evidence they need to present to pursue claims.\n\u201cOur job is to help them turn those reports into actual results so every landlord and broker who breaks the law is held fully accountable,\u201d he said.\n",

        "content": "One of the most powerful figures in global real estate investing is leaving the building.\nBlackstone\u2019s Kathleen McCarthy, who helped grow the firm\u2019s property arm into a $320 billion behemoth, will depart by year\u2019s end after 15 years with the company, Bisnow\nreported\n. McCarthy, 47, has served since 2018 as global co-head of Blackstone Real Estate \u2014 the world\u2019s largest private property investor \u2014 and will step down to \u201cexplore new opportunities,\u201d the company said. Her co-lead,\nNadeem Meghji\n, 45, will take over as sole head of the business.\nMcCarthy joined the firm in 2008 from Goldman Sachs. Since then, Blackstone\u2019s assets under management nearly tripled from $115 billion to $320 billion. That growth occurred during multiple real estate cycles: the post-financial crisis boom, the\npandemic disruption\nand the higher-rate slump that followed in 2022.\nShe wrote in a LinkedIn post that leading the firm\u2019s real estate arm was \u201cone of the great privileges\u201d of her career.\nBefore taking the top job in 2018, McCarthy served as chief operating officer of Blackstone\u2019s real estate division. She stepped up alongside Ken Caplan when longtime chief Jon Gray became Blackstone\u2019s president. After Caplan was promoted to global co-CIO last year, Meghji \u2014 then head of North American real estate \u2014 was elevated to share leadership with McCarthy.\nThe timing of McCarthy\u2019s departure comes as Blackstone pivots back to deal mode, having sold $16.9 billion worth of real estate in the first nine months of 2025, roughly in line with last year\u2019s pace.\nIt\u2019s unclear what McCarthy\u2019s next move will be. Blackstone veterans have made waves after leaving the firm.

        "content": "Predictions are hard. Especially about the future.\nI\u2019m not sure if Yogi Berra actually said that, but it\u2019s particularly true for elected officials talking about real estate, a topic they think they understand but don\u2019t.\nState Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal said in November 2021 that the Soho/Noho rezoning would invite an\ninflux of big-box stores\n. The rezoning was approved weeks later. Have you noticed any big-box stores opening in Soho and Noho?\nCity Comptroller Brad Lander managed to get the New York Times to publish his\nop-ed\nin 2020 saying the pandemic would trigger a wave of multifamily foreclosures, so the city should prepare to buy them on the cheap and turn them into social housing.\nThe wave of foreclosures didn\u2019t happen, as people soon returned to the city and rents shot right back to where they had been, and then higher.\nOne comment that politicians and activists often make about a market-rate project that would be the first in a particular low-income area is that it will cause other towers to pop up like weeds, and before you know it, there goes the neighborhood!\nOn that note, consider the fate of the Jay Group\u2019s 90-foot-tall, 183-unit apartment building at 2886 Atlantic Avenue in East New York, a neighborhood that most would-be gentrifiers cannot even find on a map. Permits were\nfiled\nfor the project in early 2022.\nFast forward to this 2025\nheadline\nabout the project in City Limits:\n\u201cThis Building Was Supposed to be Luxury Apartments. Now It Will House 183 Families From Homeless Shelters.\u201d\nDemand for one-bedrooms priced at $2,500 to $3,000 per month did not materialize, and the Jay Group had sold it to Camber Property Group and the Institute for Community Living.\nDevelopers don\u2019t control the future any more than politicians can predict it. They look to invest in areas with untapped demand and try to get a lender to sign on. Sometimes they guess wrong.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nAre the locals who feared gentrification in East New York happy that they got homeless people instead? Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: New York students in elementary, middle and high school will be taught personal finance beginning next year, the Albany Times Union\nreported\n. It\u2019s a long-overdue reform that many other states have already made. Whether it will eventually reduce the number of adults overwhelmed by credit card debt or help more people qualify for a mortgage is anyone\u2019s guess, but it was educational malpractice not to give them more tools to navigate their financial future.\nElsewhere\u2026\nA father called me from North Carolina, asking for a link to a\nTRD\nstory about substantial rehabilitation as one of the last remaining ways to remove a building from rent stabilization. He was doing research for his son, who is in court trying to get a six-month lease for an SRO in an old hotel that the owner is trying to convert into market-rate rentals.\nThe property has just two SRO units left, down from 72, as many tenants accepted buyouts.\nThe conversation became heated when he called it an example of greed by real estate investors wiping out affordable housing. I said, Have you ever asked for a raise? Does that make you greedy?\nThe law allows for deregulation in certain circumstances, I said. If the developer can convince the court that he has a legal right to deny your son the lease, he may do so. If not, your son can move in. That\u2019s why we have a court system.\nThe caller settled down and thanked me for\nthe link\n(\u201cHow Greenbrook weathered the storm\u201d).\nClosing time\nResidential:\nNo filings on Veterans Day.\nCommercial:\nNo filings. See above!\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$11.25 million\nfor a pre-war co-op unit at 911 Park Avenue on the Upper East Side. Michael J. Franco, Miriam Richards and Greg Holzmann of Compass have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 56,542-square-foot,\n99-unit\nresidential project at 3999 Carpenter Avenue in Wakefield. Nikolai Katz filed the permit on behalf of Steven Westreich of Westorchard Management.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "Donald Trump took to Truth Social to blast Chicago\u2019s retail market, pointing to the \u201cMiracle Mile\u201d as evidence. Trouble is, he got the name wrong. It\u2019s the\nMagnificent Mile\n, and his other facts weren\u2019t much sharper.\nIn a now-viral message posted shortly before midnight, the president confused the name of the Windy City\u2019s famous shopping corridor with a stretch of retail in Los Angeles, and painted a bleak picture of urban decay that\u2019s out of step with reality.\n\u201cThe Miracle Mile Shopping Center in Chicago, once considered our Nation\u2019s BEST, now has a more than 28% vacancy factor, and is ready to call it quits unless something is done about the murder and crime, which is prevalent throughout the City,\u201d the 79-year-old president said on the platform. \u201cCALL IN THE TROOPS, FAST, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!\u201d\nThe vacancy rate on the Mag Mile is about 25 percent. And that has come down from 30 percent two years ago. It\u2019s unclear why President Trump chose now to post his critique.\nThe White House didn\u2019t immediately return a request for clarity on Trump\u2019s social media post.\nYes, there\u2019s been some deals for office towers on the\nMag Mile that fell apart\nor traded at dismal prices. See billionaire Neil Bluhm\u2019s struggle to sell 401 North Michigan Avenue, and Connecticut-based developer Commonwealth\u2019s plan to convert\n500 North Michigan\ninto housing after buying the 24-story building for just $5.1 million.\nMore to the president\u2019s point, there was a high-profile smash-and-grab incident at the Mag Mile\u2019s Louis Vuitton store at 919 North Michigan that led to a fatal car crash in August, when 40-year-old Mark Arceta was killed by one of the alleged perpetrators speeding through the intersection of Michigan and Ohio Street. Arceta\u2019s partner was reportedly due to give birth the next day, according to Block Club Chicago\nreporting\n.\nThere\u2019s no argument that the commercial property market is in rough shape right now. Murder charges have been filed in connection with the tragedy. Yet it\u2019s not clear whether that incident or another prompted Trump to chide the city.\nFurthermore, retail crime in the Chicago Police Department district including the Mag Mile has dropped by 4 percent year-over-year, and foot traffic is returning, according to a recent report by on-again, off-again Trump ally Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, the commercial vacancy rate is improving as landlords recalibrate rents to today\u2019s more sober expectations, giving new tenants a shot at prime real estate without the pre-pandemic sticker shock.\nPlus, developer\nAMLI Residential\nin September unveiled plans to build 498 rental units with nearly 27,000 square feet of retail within a 56-story skyscraper at 669 North Michigan \u2014 that type of investment usually doesn\u2019t occur on commercial corridors that require the National Guard to come in and clean up, as Trump suggested the Mag Mile does.\nIt\u2019s true that prime shopping strips in other cities, such as\nRodeo Drive\nin Beverly Hills and\nFifth Avenue\nin New York, have had their vacancy rates drop below pre-pandemic levels.\nChicago\u2019s Mag Mile has seen an uptick, however. It comes as property values on Michigan Avenue have corrected from their overheated pre-Covid peaks. Retailers who might have once balked at Mag Mile premiums are starting to jump back in, enticed by more reasonable rates and stabilized street conditions. The area isn\u2019t back to its old glory \u2014 several flagships remain dark \u2014 but it\u2019s not the retail graveyard Trump implied either.\nIronically, Trump\u2019s own tower is just a block west of the Mag Mile\u2019s base, so he should know the corridor\u2019s name. It\u2019s understandable, though, why he might be\npersonally frustrated\nwith the city\u2019s retail market. The Trump International Hotel and Tower has long struggled to lease its 70,000-square-foot retail space fronting the Chicago River. The Trump Organization earlier this year hired Newmark brokers to try to finally fill the space, which has sat largely vacant since the building opened over a decade ago.\nThe Newmark team said there\u2019s momentum at the Trump Tower space, however, and pointed out some positive signs for the proximate Mag Mile. \u201cWe\u2019re currently in active discussions with a number of prospective tenants, including a 2,800-square-foot space that\u2019s out to lease, as well as several larger restaurant and entertainment concepts,\u201d James Schutter of Newmark said in an email, without mentioning details of the Trump Tower deal in the works.\nHe did mention several factors propelling the Mag Mile\u2019s rebound, though. Among them are lines out the door for the recently started Harry Potter store, Aritzia opening in a former Gap shop and fellow apparel retailer Uniqlo returning to Michigan Avenue after closing a different store in 2021. And there\u2019s a\n$50 million investment into a magic-themed, adults-only theater\ncalled The Hand &amp; The Eye going into the Mag Mile at 100 East Ontario Street.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see Mag Mile\u2019s vacancy challenges to be unique to Chicago \u2014 most major urban retail corridors have been through a period of adjustment since the pandemic,\u201d Schutter said. \u201cTypical of the Midwest\u2019s conservative nature, it\u2019s just a slower return to normalcy, but it is a return. We\u2019re seeing entertainment and experiential concepts increasingly filling spaces on the Avenue, and pricing has adjusted as property values have receded somewhat from pre-Covid highs.\u201d\nThe broader picture in downtown Chicago is one of slow but measurable recovery. Shopping strips such as\nArmitage Avenue\nand the Southport Corridor are practically bursting at the seams, nearing fully occupied. Office-to-residential conversions are getting city support, tourism is rebounding and developers are repositioning older assets. The commercial core is no longer in freefall, despite political talking points that say otherwise.\nProperty values remain below their pre-pandemic highs, but the fact they\u2019re starting to trade hands, even at depressed prices such as\nKetu Amin\u2019s recently struck $72 million purchase\nfor a Westin on the Mag Mile, is a sign of the market functioning the way it\u2019s supposed to when in need of a reset.\nTrump\u2019s misfire may score him clicks, but real estate insiders watching the Mag Mile know better: the market\u2019s showing signs of life.\n",

        "content": "Chicago developer LG Group is cashing in on the city\u2019s red-hot rental market, listing its newly built River North apartment complex for sale.\nLG is seeking a buyer for the Hugo, a nine-story, 227-unit building at 411 West Chicago Avenue and 751 North Hudson Avenue, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Newmark\u2019s Elizabeth Gagliardi, Susan Lawson and Chuck Johanns are marketing the property, which also includes 19,000 square feet of ground-floor retail.\nIt\u2019s unclear what\nLG\nspent developing the property or how much it hopes to fetch in a sale.\nThe move comes weeks after LG put another of its recent projects \u2014 the\nArthur on Aberdeen\nin Fulton Market \u2014 on the block.\nThe listings arrive as downtown landlords ride a surge in rent growth driven by limited new supply. The Class A apartment market posted a 6.3 percent year-over-year rent increase in the third quarter, hitting an average of $3,228 a month, according to Luxury Living. River North led the charge, with rents jumping 13 percent to $3,738.\nCompleted in 2023, the Hugo is roughly 96 percent leased, according to CoStar.\nAvailable one-bedroom units are listed around $2,550 a month, while two-bedrooms are approaching $4,000. The project gave\nLG\na foothold in one of Chicago\u2019s strongest rental submarkets, where proximity to the tech corridor and a spate of restaurant and retail openings have kept demand high.\nRecords show the firm paid $14.2 million for the site in 2019 and secured a $75 million construction loan in 2021. The deal could test investor appetite for stabilized downtown assets.\nThe listing could also be part of a broader capital recycling strategy as LG evaluates timing in a still-favorable rent environment. With construction starts at their lowest level in nearly 30 years, strong fundamentals may give sellers like LG a narrow window to lock in returns before the next development wave hits.\nLG is still investing in construction in\nFulton Market\n, including a five-story, 66-unit residential building at 1201-19 West Kinzie Street.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The structures are valued at a total of $80 million.\nTwo other buildings, a 188,434-square-foot Building A and a 476,000-square-foot Building D, will be developed as market demand increases. Once that part joins Phase I, the entire development will consist of more than 1 million square feet of Class A\nindustrial\nspace.\nBrinkmann Constructors serves as the general contractor for I-10 International Phase I. Butler Design Group and Ware Malcomb handled the project\u2019s design. Jesse Blum of PICOR/Cushman &amp; Wakefield is the exclusive leasing broker.\nThe development is in a\nForeign Trade Zone\nnear the critical arteries of Interstates 10 and 19 and Tucson International Airport, the second-busiest airport in the state. The buildings at I-10 International Phase I boast unique amenities designed to attract and retain a new wave of employees, including an outdoor amenity space with shaded and landscaped areas, built-in barbecue equipment and seating for outdoor relaxing, dining and games.\nLincoln hopes the project\u2019s \u201cnext-gen features and people-first approach\u201d will attract tenants and their workers to the new space in the coming months, Lincoln senior vice president John Orsak said.\nWhile Phoenix has traditionally been the logistics hub in Arizona, some developers have looked to the Tucson area as land costs and congestion in Phoenix increase. E-commerce companies like Amazon and FedEx are already operating in the Tucson area. Lincoln\u2019s I-10 International project is the latest in a string of speculative build-outs anticipated to bring in tenants looking to set up operations in the Grand Canyon State while avoiding the pricier Phoenix market.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The committee will also vote to skip the competitive process of leasing and awarding development rights of county-owned property to private firms.\nKendall-based Pinnacle is partnering with Delray Beach-based Smith &amp; Henzy Affordable Group to propose 821 homes at three public housing complexes and a vacant lot in the West Little River neighborhood in an unincorporated area of the county.\nPinnacle is led by Louis Wolfson, David O.

Its application doesn\u2019t list a specific number of units, and the county staff members\u2019 memorandum to commissioners says the goal would be to maximize development to up to 1,000 homes.\nSwerdlow would partner with Miami-based\nLennar\non the development of the for-sale homes, according to its filing.\nResidents at the public housing complexes will have the right of first refusal to move into the new homes.\nPinnacle\u2019s West Little River project\nPinnacle and Smith &amp; Henzy\u2019s total project is expected to cost $335 million, partly covered by grants and government loans that often finance below-market rate housing, according to the county\u2019s memo.\nThe pair propose to redevelop the 38-unit Kline Nunn complex at 8300 North Miami Avenue into a seven-story, 96-unit building with 2,400 square feet of retail; as well as the 86-unit Little River Plaza at 8255 Northwest Miami Court with an eight-story, 121-unit building with 3,500 square feet of retail.\nThey also propose a 604-unit complex with buildings ranging from three stories to eight stories at the 108-unit Little River Terrace at 8320 Northwest Fifth Avenue, according to the application.\nTheir projects would consist primarily of rentals, except the Little River Terrace site will include 22 for-sale townhomes.\nThe developers also want to build a 5,000-square-foot community center at the nearly 2-acre vacant Larchmont Gardens Park. The park is on the northeast corner of I-95 and Northwest 85th Street Road.\nPinnacle\nand Smith &amp; Henzy would lease the site under a 99-year term, during which they would pay Miami-Dade a total of $704.7 million in rent and $16.8 million in additional benefits, such as 15 percent of the developer fee and net cash flow.\nSwerdlow\u2019s south Miami-Dade project\nSwerdlow\u2019s\nproposal is to redevelop the 114-unit Arthur Mays Villas at 11351 Southwest 216th Street in the\nGoulds\nneighborhood; the 116-unit Naranja complex at 13924 Southwest 260th Street in\nNaranja\n; and the 130-unit Pine Island complex at 26862 Southwest 127th Avenue and 27101 Southwest 128th Avenue, according to its application.\nIt also wants to build out the vacant Modelo II site at 15302 and 15370 Southwest 282nd Street, and 17375 Southwest 284th Street.\nThe Arthur Mays project would consist of for-sale homes and at least 75 apartments, while the Naranja and Modelo II projects would be entirely for sale.\nThe Pine Island project would have about 246 Rental Assistance Demonstration units, meaning apartments at the same rents that residents pay now, and 279 workforce apartments, the application shows.\nFor-sale home prices will be $385,000, Swerdlow\u2019s application shows.\n",

        "content": "Apartment Investment and Management Company, better known as Aimco, is preparing to go out of business.\nThe Denver-based multifamily owner and operator announced plans to sell off all of its assets across the country, Bisnow\nreported\n. It\u2019s the conclusion to a nearly year-long saga that began after the firm started a strategic review of options in January.\nAimco\nhas seemingly seen the writing on the wall for some time, selling off properties across the country and shaving down its holdings to just 15 assets in New York, Georgia, Illinois, California, Tennessee and Florida. The company recently delivered three developments and is also building a\nluxury apartment complex\nin Miami that\u2019s set for completion in 2027.\nThe review process involved Aimco speaking with more than 100 firms, including financial sponsors, investment managers, public real estate investment trusts and private real estate firms. This year alone, the company saw a 1.9 percent decline in property net operating income compared to last year; at the same time, property expenses increased 1.1 percent and average occupancy fell from the prior quarter to 94.8 percent.\nThe board of Aimco unanimously came to the decision to shut down after \u201cthoroughly [exploring] various strategic alternatives\u201d with other entities. \u201cThe voluntary and orderly liquidation of the company\u2019s remaining assets is most likely to result in the greatest value for shareholders as compared to other alternatives,\u201d Pat Gibson, chair of Aimco\u2019s investment committee, said in a statement.\nAimco plans to have shareholders vote on its liquidation proposal early next year. If it gets the go-ahead, the public real estate firm would be able to more swiftly sell assets and return the proceeds to shareholders after paying off any of Aimco\u2019s liabilities and obligations. Aimco has lost more than 30 percent of its stock value this year. At the end of September, it had $404 million in cash on hand and $748M in debt, including mortgages backing properties.\nRecent Aimco sales include a deal in August to\nsell five New England residential communities\nto Harbor Group International for $740 million. It\u2019s also under contract to\nsell a multifamily and office assemblage\non the Miami waterfront for $520 million; that deal is set to close next month in what would be a record sale for the seaside city.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

There\u2019s no guarantee the search process will result in a sale of the boutique lodging brand.\nMoelis and Eastdil declined to comment to the publication, while Quadrum did not respond to the publication\u2019s request.\nQuadrum\nstarted\nthe micro-hotel brand in 2016 after a collaboration with John Pritzker fell apart. The brand\u2019s portfolio of seven hotels \u2014 designed for urban travelers \u2014 includes four locations in New York City (one of which is in Brooklyn), as well as one apiece in Chicago, Miami and Washington, D.C.\nThe brand leveled up at the start of 2023, when Quadrum acquired the bankrupt 147-key Williamsburg Hotel at 96 Wythe Avenue in Brooklyn for\n$96 million\n. The purchase came months after developers Toby Moskovits and Michael Lichtenstein\nwere stripped of control\nof the hotel by a federal bankruptcy judge.\nPod Hotel and Yotel were among the top players in the sector at the time of launch, at least in Manhattan. Competitors today include Marriott International\u2019s citizenM brand and Generator Hostels.\nThere\u2019s been significant recent investor activity in New York City\u2019s hotel market, leading to plenty of wheeling and dealing of properties. This week, Andrew Farkas\u2019 Island Capital and its joint venture partners, Three Wall Capital and MCR, listed the 725-key Lexington Hotel in Midtown East,\neyeing a price of roughly $275 million\n; Eastdil is also involved in that sale.\nThe average occupancy rate in New York City exceeded 84 percent per week last year, up from a pandemic low of about 50 percent, according to a report by Lodging Analytics Research &amp; Consulting. Expenses tied to labor costs, high interest rates and property taxes, however, continue to affect the industry\u2019s bottom line.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The family office of one of the North Shore\u2019s wealthiest investors bought out developer Shapack Partners\u2019 interests in Chicago sites collectively known as\nNOMA\n, which had been slated for more than 2,200 apartments and a hotel,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nJeff Shapack, one of the visionaries of the Fulton Market District\u2019s real estate boom, was previously the face of the project \u2014 named for its location \u201cnorth of market\u201d in relation to Fulton.\nBut recently, Glencoe-based investors\nAlec and Jennifer Litowitz\nharnessed full control of the collection of NOMA properties spanning Grand and Milwaukee avenues between North Des Plaines and Halsted streets near the Ohio Street feeder ramp for the Kennedy Expressway.\nThe development sites were assembled for $60 million between 2017 and 2022 through a series of purchases led by Shapack with the financial backing of the Litowitzes.\nA spokesperson for the Litowitz family confirmed it had acquired full control of the properties and would oversee their development without Shapack\u2019s assistance.\n\u201cThe family will continue to be closely involved in crafting the vision and strategy of the project and collaborate with suitable partners on execution,\u201d the Litowitz spokesperson said.\nThe amount Shapack was paid to sell its interests to the family is unknown as each side declined to disclose the price.\n\u201cWe continue to focus our development efforts in and around the Fulton Market District and look forward to NOMA\u2019s future evolution as a project that will further strengthen the 27th Ward,\u201d Jeff Shapack said in a statement.\nThe Litowitz family had always been the majority owners of the development venture but Shapack served as its real estate expert through land purchases and the city approval process.\nSince getting the multi-phase project entitled, Shapack has turned its attention to other developments, such as its partnership with CRG on\n220 North Ada Street\n, where they\u2019re close to completing a 29-story apartment project. CRG and Shapack also kicked off construction this summer on a student housing project in\nAnn Arbor, Michigan\n, and Shapack is partnering with KMW Communities to build a 79-unit apartment building at 450 North Morgan Street in Chicago.\nCity officials\nsigned off on the NOMA plans\nin 2022.\nThe land sites total about 3.3 acres, and were packaged together through a strings of deals starting back in 2017, when 451 North Union Avenue was purchased by an LLC tied to the NOMA development team for $8 million.\nThe acquisition spree was capped off by the\n$25 million purchase\nof the former Salvation Army building at 509 North Union Avenue, the largest deal within the assemblage and where a 141-room hotel is being planned as part of the project.\nIt\u2019s unclear how large Shapack\u2019s ownership stake was, but the same Delaware-based LLCs that began the assemblage still own the parcels, public records show.\n\u201cThe former partnership was focused on land acquisition and entitlements. Both goals were accomplished, hence the natural conclusion,\u201d the Litowitz spokesperson said. The rezoning for the project is a first in terms of the density allowed within this area of Chicago.\nThe sites appear to be carrying relatively little debt compared to their development team\u2019s purchase prices. There\u2019s a $4.3 million mortgage from Northbrook Bank &amp; Trust on the 441 North Milwaukee Avenue property taken out in 2022, and modified by Litowitz to extend its maturity another two years as the original due date was approaching in 2024, records show.\nOther than that, there\u2019s less than $1 million in mortgage debt owed to the same bank for 709 West Grand Avenue.\nThe vision included plans to transform the Salvation Army site into lodging with a ground-floor restaurant as part of the team\u2019s launch of redevelopment in the area.\nJust to the east of the Salvation Army building, a separate set of properties had been set to be redeveloped into 1,110 rental units, mostly within a 625-foot-tall tower.\nTo the south of Grand Avenue, the development team made a separate application to the city with plans for 708-732 West Hubbard Street, 456-476 North Milwaukee, 461-483 North Milwaukee, 448-470 North Union and 449-467 North Union. Shapack had proposed building another 1,159 apartments across these sites, with three towers rising from them. The tallest would have been 487 feet, with the other two hitting 326 and 270 feet.\nShapack and Alec Litowitz have paired on successful Chicago real estate projects previously. They sold a seven-story office building developed at\n811 West Fulton Street\nto Boston-based investor Intercontinental Real Estate for $50.3 million in 2019, setting a Chicago record for price per square foot of $775. Last year, Shapack and Litowitz also listed the West Loop building they transformed into\nBarstool Sports\u2019 offices\nfeaturing a basketball court, recording studio and other unique amenities.\nThe trendy Shapack-developed office building at\n167 North Green Street in Fulton Market\nwas refinanced for $247 million earlier this year despite a harsh lending environment for commercial workspace.\n",

        "content": "In a wide field of Republican challengers to incumbent Democratic\nGov. JB Pritzker\n, one bigtime real estate professional has thrown his hat into the ring. His commercial property success may, however, be overshadowed by his at-times controversial video gambling business.\nHoffman Estates-based real estate investor Rick Heidner joined the seven-way race to earn the Republican nomination for governor just before the Nov. 3 filing deadline closed.\nHeidner and his wife, Alisa Heidner, run commercial real estate firm Heidner Properties, along with their four children. The company owns and manages 280 commercial properties across the U.S., making him the most experienced real estate professional in the GOP primary.\nOver the past three years, the company has led the turnaround of a struggling suburban Chicago shopping mall, the Arboretum of South Barrington.\nHeidner bought the mall out of foreclosure in 2022 after Starwood Capital defaulted on\na $67 million loan tied to the property\n. Heidner introduced an outdoor summer concert series at the mall, and a slew of businesses have signed leases at the asset.\nThe family also owns video gambling company Gold Rush Gaming, which operates in 700 locations across Illinois, according to Heidner Properties\u2019 website. Other ventures run by the Heidners include a line of gas stations called Ricky Rockets Fuel Centers and gas station fuel provider Prairie State Energy.\nThe gambling business once led Heinder to clash with Pritzker\u2019s administration.\nPritzker\nsquashed a proposal\nin 2019 to sell a state-owned property in\nTinley Park\n, where Heinder was proposing to build a casino and racetrack with Hawthorne Race Course president Tim Carey.\nThe plan was dismantled amid a series of clashes between Gold Rush Gambling and state gaming regulators.\nA\nChicago Tribune investigation found\nthat Heidner had ties to Rocco Suspenzi, who was part of an unsuccessful bid to bring a separate casino to Rosemont that was derailed due to the proposed casino\u2019s involvement with alleged\norganized crime figures\n. The investigation also found that Heidner had a business relationship with Dominic Buttitta, who pleaded guilty to running an illegal bookmaking operation.\nSeparately, Heidner was the subject of a year-and-half long investigation led by state gambling regulators into his ties to a 2019 federal search warrant issued in a wide-ranging public corruption probe involving many top state lawmakers. He was ultimately found to not be a target of the federal investigation and to be \u201cin good standing\u201d with gambling regulators in 2021.\nDetails of Heidner\u2019s campaign platform so far are scarce. He has previously donated $250,000 to both Republican and Democratic candidates in Illinois. His campaign was launched with $1 million of his own funding, according to filing materials.\nThe other candidates in the Republican primary are DuPage County Sheriff James Mendrick, valet service owner Joseph Severino, former GOP gubernatorial primary winner Darren Bailey, conservative activist Ted Dabrowski, former state senate candidate Max Solomon and two-time former gubernatorial candidate Gregg Moore.\nOne Democrat who previously ran for Chicago City Council, Patricia Tillman, joins Pritzker in the Democratic primary.\nThe dynamics of the Republican primary were nearly upended last month when potential frontrunner Bailey\u2019s son, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren died in a helicopter crash. He announced Nov. 11, however, that he would continue his campaign.\nWhoever wins the GOP primary in March 2026 will probably face Pritzker, the likely Democratic nominee, in November 2026. The dynamics of the race could change, however, should Pritzker decide to launch a rumored run for president.",

SVN\u2019s Diana Gaines represented Red Hill Ventures in the deal.\nThe 60-acre tract will become Pinemoor, a single-family development with 216 residential lots and a central park with a playground and walking trails.\nSmith Douglas Homes plans to complete the first phase of lots next summer, and sales will commence in the fourth quarter of 2026.\nThe sale is a significant advancement for the hindered project.\nRed Hill Ventures\u2019 subsidiary company, Magnolia Paragon LLC, has owned 95 acres north of FM 1488 and Mill Creek since 2022. In 2023, the company announced\nMagnolia Crossing\n, a subdivision with about 300 luxury apartments and over 200 single-family homes.\nRed Hill Ventures agreed in 2023 to let the City of Magnolia annex the land to generate additional property and sales tax revenue. The city council finally approved a petition to annex the land for residential and commercial development in June of this year, according to\nCommunity Impact\n.\nThe delay was due to a\nmoratorium on new development\nto relieve strain on the city\u2019s\nwater infrastructure\n. Magnolia\u2019s population has grown by 147 percent since 2020, according to the city.\nAfter the sale to Smith Douglas Homes, the 35 acres still owned by Red Hill Ventures will eventually include mixed-use and multifamily developments \u201cdesigned to complement the new residential community,\u201d according to SVN.\nThe original plan proposed either a grocery story or fitness center as the anchor of the development, according to the\nHouston Chronicle\n.\n",

        "content": "Billionaire Jeffrey Soffer\u2019s plan for a water park at his Fontainebleau Miami Beach resort could splash into approval \u2014 or denial \u2014 by a key city board next week.\nThe Miami Beach Historic Preservation Board is set to vote on Tuesday on the planned redevelopment of the 1,504-room oceanfront hotel\u2019s outdoor pool area. The waterpark would be open to the public for yet undetermined fees. The property is at 4441 Collins Avenue.\nAn affiliate of\nSoffer\u2019s\nAventura-based Fontainebleau Development is seeking 11 variances in order to make room for 11 waterslides, a kid\u2019s play pool, refurbished and new bathrooms, cabanas, and associated supporting spaces,\u201d according to a Sept. 11 letter of intent filed with the city of Miami Beach. Renderings show the waterslides are connected to a 12-story structure.\nThe variances include a request to eliminate 10-foot setbacks at the rear of the\nFontainebleau Miami Beach\nto make room for a new two-story structure that will have new cabanas and bathrooms. Soffer\u2019s firm is also seeking to reduce the amount of open space near sand dunes on the beach, and permission to place decks, patios and beach furniture within a 10-foot setback from any beach erosion control line.\nShould the board approve the variances, Fontainebleau Development expects to complete the water park next year.\nWhen Soffer and his sister,\nJackie Soffer\n, split their real estate holdings and projects into two companies in 2019, he took ownership of the Fontainebleau Miami Beach.\nLast year, Soffer secured a\n$1.2 billion\nrefinancing for Fontainebleau Miami Beach, which includes the original curved hotel designed by architect Morris Lapidus. Opened in 1954, the hotel sits on 15 acres and includes 11 pools, a 40,000-square-foot spa and 12 food and beverage venues, including Liv nightclub. The site also includes three residential towers.\nAlso last year,\nFontainebleau Development\ncompleted a five-story business center on a lot at 4360 and 4370 Collins Avenue, adjacent to the Miami Beach resort. The facility is connected to the Fontainebleau Miami Beach\u2019s Tresor Tower via a skybridge.",

        "content": "UCLA, the Brentwood School and a private parking operator are paying pennies on the dollar to lease prime West Los Angeles land from the\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\nthat federal officials believe should be used to house homeless vets.\nThe three tenants collectively pay about $2.3 million a year for roughly 36 acres on the VA\u2019s 388-acre West L.A. campus, which a new federal\nreport\nvalues at more than $48 million, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n. The findings mark a sharp turn in the VA\u2019s position on leases a federal judge voided last year for violating a 2016 law requiring the campus to primarily benefit veterans.\nThe Brentwood School pays $850,000 annually for its athletic complex, or less than 3 percent of the 22 acres\u2019 approximately $30.3 million market rent. The\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles\n\u2019 baseball team plays at Jackie Robinson Stadium and owes roughly $12.3 million at market rates for its 10-acre lease but paid only $320,844 over nine months before its lease was invalidated last year.\nSafetyPark Incorporated, which operates parking lots on-site, paid less than $600,000 for nearly 4 acres with a market rental rate of nearly $5.9 million. In total, as of September 2024, the VA claims it received just $1.7 million in annual rent from the three leases, making up less than 5 percent of the estimated market value.\nAs part of its agreement with the VA, the Brentwood School was required to provide in-kind services through the use of its facilities and veteran activities at an annual value of $918,000 annually; school officials claim it provided more than $1.8 million in the year ending last September. The school issued a statement Monday committing to preserving its relationship with veterans and the federal government.\nUCLA, meanwhile, says it provides services to veterans through a family resource center and a mental health and addiction center on top of its monthly rent of $25,000 for Jackie Robinson Stadium. \u201cOver the years, UCLA has provided millions of dollars in services and benefits to our veterans at no cost. Unfortunately, as a result of the judge\u2019s ruling, UCLA was prohibited from accessing the property for a period of time,\u201d a spokesperson for the university told the Times, saying the university hopes to resolve the issue quickly to continue \u201crealiz[ing] the full benefits of this long-standing partnership.\u201d\nLawmakers and veterans\u2019 advocates blasted the arrangement with the leaseholders, calling it a misuse of public land in one of the nation\u2019s most expensive ZIP codes.\n\u201cIt is clear that VA has been dramatically underpaid for renting land that could have been used to directly benefit veterans,\u201d Rep. Mike Bost, chair of the House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs, said of the arrangement.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s report comes after a May executive order from the\npresident directing the VA to build 6,000 housing units\non the site, an expansion of a\nprior court mandate\nfor 2,500 units.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Kohan Retail Investment Group is doubling down on Chicago\u2019s office distress.\nThe New York-based firm acquired the $60 million mortgage tied to 33 West Monroe Street, a 28-story Loop tower whose value plummeted along with much of downtown\u2019s office stock, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The mortgage amounts to $67 per square foot.\nThe\nfirm\n, best known for buying distressed\nmalls\n, bought the debt from a venture of Principal Life Insurance, which refinanced the property for landlord AmTrustRE in 2011, according to the outlet.\nTranswestern reported last month that the loan was under contract for roughly $25 million \u2014 about $28 per square foot \u2014 signaling just how far prices for Loop office assets have fallen.\nThe 900,000-square-foot tower, once home to Arthur Andersen, is about 44 percent leased \u2014 well below the downtown average of 72 percent, per CoStar.\nThe move marks another calculated bet on Chicago\u2019s office slump for Kohan.\nThe\nGreat Neck\n, New York-based investor paid $45 million in June for 311 South Wacker Drive, a deal that valued the 65-story tower about 85 percent below its last sale price more than a decade ago.\nBy buying the Monroe Street debt, Kohan positions itself to take control of the building if AmTrust defaults, which is an increasingly likely scenario as landlords struggle with maturing loans, high interest rates and shrinking tenant demand.\nAmTrust, one of the Loop\u2019s most active but embattled office owners, was hit hard in the post-pandemic downturn. It lost\n30 North LaSalle Street\nto foreclosure, faces a lawsuit over its $260 million\nIllinois Center\nmortgage, and has flirted with surrendering\n135 South LaSalle\nbefore pivoting to a planned office-to-resi conversion with local partners under the city\u2019s LaSalle Street Reimagined program.\nWhether AmTrust intends to hold onto 33 West Monroe is unclear.\nThe firm previously hinted at possible renovations as part of a \u201clater phase\u201d of its Chicago reinvestment strategy, but no work has been announced. Kohan, meanwhile, joins a growing wave of New York investors betting on the Loop\u2019s recovery through distressed deals, among them\nNamdar Realty Group\nand Mason Asset Management, now in talks to buy 190 South LaSalle Street.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The housing development planned to be built in its place would consist of one- and two-bedroom units.\nOf the 112 planned units, nine will be set aside for very-low-income households; in Contra Costa County, $79,900 in income per year for a household of four is considered \u201cvery-low-income.\u201d\nIn order to get the project approved more quickly, DeNova is looking to pursue a streamlined city review process under\nSenate Bill 330\n. It previously used SB 330 to secure approval for two\nhousing projects in Antioch\nconsisting of 159 and 129 units.\nMultifamily properties in Walnut Creek have been trading hands in recent months, though some housing projects are working their way down the pike to aid in the city meeting its state-mandated housing goals.\nIn September, for example, a local property owner submitted\na preapplication\nto build a 74-unit apartment building on the site of Dutch Girl Cleaners at 2094 Mount Diablo Boulevard.\nLast month, a TA Realty affiliate bought the 285-unit\nHanover Walnut Creek\napartments at 3050 Del Hombre for $163 million, or $571,900 per unit. The property was built in 2023.\nThat sale marked the second time in two months that large apartment complexes in Walnut Creek that were built in recent years fetched more than $150 million. In August, an\nAcacia Capital affiliate bought\nthe 358-unit Waymark apartment complex at 101 Pringle Avenue for $190 million, or $530,700 per unit.\nThe City of Walnut Creek must plan to build 5,805 new housing units by 2031 as part of its\nhousing element\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A chill has blown through\nTexas\u2019 luxury home market\n, but there\u2019s a well-insulated pocket that\u2019s untapped.\nDemand is still swelling for\nluxury condo projects\nin the Lone Star State, where the market has been slower to develop than in other major cities.\nHouston alone is on track for at least four branded projects, including: a Ritz-Carlton in the Woodlands, another Ritz-Carlton in the Galleria, a St. Regis project in Rice Military and Auberge condos in Upper Kirby.\nAfter receiving a $255 million construction loan in July, Satya opened the sales gallery for the St. Regis, a 38-story, 90-unit tower that will be located at 102 Asbury Street in Houston\u2019s Rice MIlitary neighborhood, just across the Buffalo Bayou from River Oaks. Satya expanded its plans for the condo tower earlier this year amid strong buyer demand.\nSatya has surpassed $100 million in contracts signed since the gallery opened in mid-September. The most recent deal tops $2,000 per square foot, according to a release from Satya. Prices start at $3 million. The project is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2027. Douglas Elliman is marketing the properties.\nThe price per square foot outpaces luxury single-family homes in Houston, which usually fetch between $500 and $1,000 per square foot.\nThe city\u2019s\nmost expensive September sale\nwas a 9,900-square-foot mansion at 1 Longfellow Lane in Houston\u2019s Museum District. The asking price for the home built in 1926 was $10.6 million or about $1,000 per square foot.\nThe St. Regis square-foot price also reflects the premium buyers will pay for branded condos versus other luxury high-rise properties.\nFor example, one of Houston\u2019s most expensive homes sold in March was a\nluxury condo at the Hawthorne\n, a 67-unit luxury condo building from Pelican Builders and Ember Group that opened last year at 5656 San Felipe Street in Tanglewood. The sale price was not disclosed, but the 3,525-square-foot condo was listed for $3.98 million or $1,130 per square foot.\nTexas luxury buyers have long favored the ranch over vertical living, and, as a result, the state\u2019s\nmarket for luxury condos\nis still largely untapped.\nPart of the reason for the market\u2019s newness is that it\u2019s hard to get condo projects financed in the Lone Star State. Texas is one of about a dozen states that does not allow developers to use deposits from condo pre-sales on construction. In states without those restrictions, deposits can finance up to 30 percent of construction costs, said DC Partners\u2019 Roberto Contreras IV.\nDevelopers are finding ways around the financing obstacles. For example, when developing the Hawthorne, Pelican Builders and Ember Group refinanced their debt on the project with a $111 million loan that leveraged the unsold inventory as collateral for the loan.\nDespite the challenges, the city\u2019s new condo projects have performed well, proving that there\u2019s demand for luxury vertical living.\nRandall Davis Company\u2019s\nLondon House\nopened earlier this year in River Oaks with all but two units pre-sold.\nIn a similar demonstration of demand for these projects, Howard Hughes had to temporarily suspend sales for its Ritz-Carlton project in the Woodlands, since there was so much demand. When construction started, 69 percent of the project\u2019s 111 units were pre-sold.\n",

        "content": "The City Council on Wednesday approved the final neighborhood rezoning of the Adams administration.\nThe Council voted in favor of rezoning 54 blocks in Long Island City, a plan that is projected to create 14,700 new homes in the Queens neighborhood over the next decade. Of those units, 4,300 are expected to be affordable.\nCouncil member Julie Won, who represents Long Island City, made clear that her support of the rezoning hinged on City Hall making several commitments. In response, the administration pledged around $1.9 billion to help create a contiguous waterfront, add more than 1,300 seats at new schools, repair public housing at Queensbridge Houses and upgrade sewer and stormwater management infrastructure. (Won and other Council members\npreviously\npegged the investment at $1.5 billion, but subsequently announced the amount was closer to $2 billion.)\nBefore advancing the rezoning, the Council also made several changes to the proposal, including requiring deeper affordability and limiting building heights in some areas. For example, developers building in the Queens Plaza West area must set aside 20 percent of a project\u2019s units for households making an average of 40 percent of the area median income, with income bands capped at 130 percent AMI.\nThose restrictions are laid out in the \u201cdeep affordability\u201d option under the city\u2019s Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program. Under the\nCity of Yes for Housing Opportunity\n, that option was made available to the Council as something it could mandate, rather than offer up alongside other affordability levels.\nMuch of Long Island City has been rezoned over the last three decades, but those plans have not included the 54-block area. The latest rezoning allows more residential, as well as retail and light-industrial use, in an area zoned for low- and medium-density manufacturing.\nThe rezoning includes city-owned sites at\n44-36 Vernon Boulevard\n, 44-59 45th Avenue and 4-99 44th Drive, which will be transferred to developers.\nThe sites were once envisioned as part of Amazon\u2019s new headquarters, before the tech giant abandoned those plans in February 2019.\nThursday marks the seven-year anniversary of Amazon announcing that it had selected Long Island City as one of the two locations where it would build a new headquarters.\nDuring a press conference ahead of Wednesday\u2019s vote, Won noted the anniversary (though she appeared to mix it up with the date Amazon pulled out of these plans).\n\u201cInstead of a $3 billion handout to a corporation like Amazon HQ2, we\u2019re now receiving $2 billion in investment,\u201d she said.\nThe rezoning is the fifth neighborhood rezoning to be approved under the Adams administration, following\nJamaica\n,\nMidtown South\n,\nAtlantic Avenue\nand areas around\nfour planned Metro-North stations in the Bronx\n.\nThe Council\u2019s vote comes after New Yorkers approved\nballot measures\nthat will change how certain housing projects are approved. Some projects will be able to bypass City Council review, while a newly-created appeals board can reverse the Council\u2019s rejection of other housing projects.\nCouncil leaders opposed the measures, arguing that they deny local members the ability to negotiate on behalf of their communities. Won has pointed to City Hall\u2019s financial commitment as evidence that local members are key to securing benefits for their constituents.\nIf the newly-approved ballot measures had been in place before the Council voted on the Long Island City rezoning, only one would have potentially applied. That measure creates a three-person appeals board that can reverse the Council\u2019s rejection of land-use applications that would create affordable housing.\nIt remains to be seen how drastically these measures change the city\u2019s land-use review process and how they are implemented by the next mayoral administration.\n",

        "content": "A year after completion, a group of developers locked down a refinancing for their 305-unit multifamily property in Williamsburg.\nThe Loketch Group, Joyland Group and Meral Property Group scored a $220 million debt package to refinance a pair of residential buildings at 268 Lorimer Street, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The debt retires a $172 million loan from TPG.\nBlackstone provided the fixed-rate, five-year, interest-only loan on the two eight-story buildings. CenterSquare also participated in the financing, which was arranged by Arrow Real Estate Advisors\u2019 Morris Betesh, Alex Bailkin and Andrew Rosenberg.\nThe development at the corner of Lorimer Street and Broadway spans 318,000 square feet with a variety of residential layouts and amenities, including a fitness center, a lounge and rooftop spaces. There are also six retail suites and more than 200 parking spaces.\nBoth buildings were completed last summer and were stabilized following a quick lease-up period, according to Arrow.\nThe joint venture acquired the development site, also addressed as 555 Broadway, from bankrupt co-living company The Collective in 2022\nfor $54 million\n. The Collective had planned to build a 500-unit apartment on the site.\nThe investor group\nlanded a $137 million loan\nfrom Slate Property Group\u2019s lending arm, SCALE Lending, to finance the acquisition and construction at the site.\nLast month, a limited liability company tied to Loketch sold a 19,000-square-foot, 27-unit apartment building in Stuyvesant Heights to real estate investor Guy Peleg\nfor $8.5 million\n. Loketch bought the property for $500,000 in 2013.\nIn the spring, Citigroup provided an\n$88 million loan\nto Joyland for a luxury apartment building in East Williamsburg. The financing for the 138-unit development, known as The Wave, replaced a $60 million loan from Churchill Real Estate Holdings.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s no secret that foreign investors fuel South Florida\u2019s condo market, but a new report shows how international buyers now dominate new development sales in submarkets with significant pipelines.\nAcross 66 condo projects in the tri-county region, foreign buyers make up 52 percent of total sales, according to a report by the\nMiami Association of Realtors\n. The report covers sales data for the 22-month period from January of last year through October of this year. The Miami Association of Realtors partnered with the brokerages Fortune Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, Cervera Real Estate, ISG World, PMG, Serhant New Development and One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty to obtain the data. It expands upon a July report that covered foreign buyer deals from January 2024 to June 2025.\nThe latest report found that 6,931 units were presold in the latest 22-month period, and 3,620 of the presales were from foreign buyers. Latin American buyers made up 86 percent of foreign buyers during that period. The top countries represented by foreign purchases were Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Turkey.\nThe report also shows foreign buyers particularly have come to dominate new development markets. In Miami\u2019s Brickell and Coconut Grove, foreign buyers accounted for 63 percent of sales; in North Miami, 59 percent of sales; in Miami\u2019s Wynwood, 63 percent of sales; in Hollywood, 76 percent of sales; and in Pompano Beach, 63 percent of sales.\nWhile foreign buyers reigned supreme in those markets, they represented a much smaller share of sales in\nFort Lauderdale\nand\nWest Palm Beach\n. Just 13 percent of Fort Lauderdale\u2019s reported sales involved foreign buyers, and in West Palm Beach that share dropped to 7 percent.\nAt\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nMiami Real Estate Forum last week\n, Fortune International Group\u2019s Edgardo Defortuna and ISG World\u2019s Craig Studnicky discussed the shifting behavior of international buyers in South Florida. Also, they said the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown has not deterred foreign buyers, rather, they have rushed to invest though the\nEB-5 visa program\n.\n\u201cDemand has been incredible,\u201d Defortuna said. \u201cBefore, EB-5 used to be mainly Chinese or the Far East, but now the Latin American buyer really understands the process.\u201d\n",

The volume of sublease inventory has fallen from pandemic highs but remains more than 50 percent above pre-2020 levels, according to\u00a0 CBRE. The brokerage\u2019s Mark Cassata, Bill Sheehy, and Brady Wolfe are marketing the space for Walgreens.\nThe\nOld Post Office\n, redeveloped by New York-based\n601W Companies\ninto 2.5 million square feet of modern workspace, was a symbol of Chicago\u2019s pre-pandemic office boom.\nWalgreens was one of the first major tenants to sign on in 2019, relocating about 1,300 suburban employees and several hundred from its State Street office in a bid to attract younger urban talent. Now, the same migration trend has reversed as corporate tenants retrench to the suburbs or shrink their office space amid remote work and cost-cutting pressures.\nWalgreens\u2019 sublease package includes 154,000 square feet of fully built-out office space with nearly 1,000 workstations, plus 39,670 square feet of raw space and a 14,600-square-foot event and conference area on the first floor. The company\u2019s lease runs through November 2032 and features prominent signage on the building\u2019s exterior.\nCBRE\u2019s materials note that the space can be combined with adjacent offices for a contiguous 300,000-square-foot block \u2014 a rare offering in the Loop. Still, finding a taker won\u2019t be easy, as sublease deals often come at deep discounts. But there have been recent takers:\nWolverine Trading\nlanded an 83,000-square-foot sublease from staffing agency TrueBlue at the Old Post Office over the summer.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The investigation closed in the transition into the Trump Administration in January.\nJones strengthened RealPage\u2019s operations and balance sheet while steering the company deeper into AI-driven tools for pricing, leasing and resident engagement, according to the company\u2019s statement.

        "content": "An oceanfront estate in Palm Beach just hit the market for $205 million, making it the island\u2019s most expensive trophy listing so far this season.\nChristian Angle with Christian Angle Real Estate has the listing for the 14,500-square-foot mansion at 1491 North Ocean Boulevard in Palm Beach, according to a press release. It was the onetime home of late fashion magnate Aldo Gucci, son of the fashion house founder Guccio Gucci. The 4.8-acre oceanfront compound is one of the most expensive homes on the market in Florida, and the latest in a string of high-profile trophy listings in the tri-county region as the busy season sets in.\nLast week, an oceanfront teardown at 911 North Ocean Boulevard in Palm Beach hit the market asking $185 million. Cosmetic surgeon Dr. Aaron Rollins and his wife Marine Rollins listed their unfinished Indian Creek Island estate in Miami-Dade County for\n$200 million\nthis week.\nThe estate at 1491 North Ocean Boulevard is the longtime winter home of the late Frank and Maureen Wilkens. Frank Wilkens was the co-founder of Greenwich, Connecticut-based investment firm Wilkens and Nanovic, which managed corporate pensions. He died in 2011, and Maureen Wilkens died in April, according to their obituaries.\nThey bought the property for $14 million in 2002, according to property records. They completed the estate in 2005. It includes the 14,500-square-foot, six-bedroom main house with six and a half bathrooms, a two-bedroom guest house with two and a half bathrooms, a pool house, two pools and 230 feet of oceanfrontage, according to records and the release.\nIf the compound sells for anywhere near the asking price, it would set a price record for the island. In 2023, luxury car dealer Michael Cantanucci\npaid $170 million\nfor an oceanfront estate at 589 North County Road, making it Palm Beach\u2019s most expensive single-family home. Earlier this year, cosmetics heir William Lauder sold two oceanfront parcels in an off-market deal for\nmore than $160 million\n, as part of a $350 million assemblage sources say is linked to Microsoft Excel creator Charles Simonyi.\nStill, selling for $205 million would fall short of a statewide record. The billionaire DeGroote family set the Florida price record in April when they sold their waterfront Naples estate for\n$225 million\n. But there\u2019s competition for the title. Also in Naples, an estate known as Gordon Pointe listed last year\nasking $295 million\n. Spec developer Stewart Satter has a 4-acre oceanfront Manalapan compound on the market asking\n$285 million\n.",

        "content": "A former manager for a Brickell condo tower was charged with allegedly diverting more than $142,000 from the association.\nYissely Herrouet hired \u201cphantom employees,\u201d who in reality were her family members and acquaintances, and paid them with funds from The Club at Brickell Bay association, according to an arrest warrant filed by the Miami-Dade State Attorney\u2019s Office. The 43-story tower at 1200 Brickell Bay Drive has 643 units and was completed in 2004, property records show.\nHerrouet, 37, is charged with one felony count each of grand theft, organized scheme to defraud, offenses against computer users and false entries in books of a business entity.\nShe could not be reached for comment.\nFrom 2020 to 2022, Herrouet, who is a Florida licensed community association manager, was an employee of FirstService Residential and was assigned to Club at Brickell Bay, according to the arrest warrant.\n\u201cHerrouet\u2019s position and specialized knowledge allowed her to hire individuals who did no work, falsify payroll records and generate timesheets to facilitate these payments,\u201d the warrant says.\nShe \u201cmanipulated and forged\u201d payrolls to hire five people as supposed association employees who did no work on the property, the arrest warrant says. Herrouet used her access to software FirstService used for workforce management to process the fake employees\u2019 payrolls, and she also fabricated \u201chandwritten timesheets on their behalf,\u201d according to the warrant.\nDuring her tenure, Herrouet also retained Sunshine Cleaning Services as Club as Brickell Bay\u2019s janitorial services provider for $29,991 monthly. It was later discovered the firm is owned by Herrouet\u2019s mother, according to the warrant.\nThe scheme started to unravel after unit owners and legitimate FirstService employees complained to FirstService that Herrouet may have been misappropriating funds. FirstService and its attorney did an internal records review and audit, and then alerted the Miami-Dade State Attorney\u2019s Office.\nAccording to the warrant, legitimate FirstService staff members who worked at Club at Brickell told an investigator that two of the five people Herrouet hired were her cousin and aunt. FirstService staff members also recognized another two of Herrouet\u2019s hires as employees for Sunshine Cleaning, meaning they were paid double from the association as employees of the cleaning company and as Herrouet\u2019s hires, the warrant says. FirstService staff members who spoke with the investigator didn\u2019t recognize the fifth person Herrouet hired as an employee for FirstService or Club at Brickell Bay.\nThe allegations are similar to those at the Hammocks, South Florida\u2019s largest homeowners association that in recent years hosted an allegedly massive HOA fraud scheme. In 2022, police arrested a former board president and her husband and three other ex-board members on allegations they siphoned more than $1 million from the association.\nAt the\nHammocks\n, the former board members allegedly hired bogus contractors who did little to no work on the West Kendall property and then paid them with association funds, investigators with the Miami-Dade State Attorney\u2019s Office said in legal filings. To execute the alleged scheme, the board members\nleaned on their family members\n, some of whom owned the fake vendors hired by the HOA.\nTwo of the former Hammocks board members pleaded guilty and are cooperating with investigators. The remaining three people who were charged have pleaded not guilty and are awaiting trial.\nAcross South Florida, residents living in communities governed by associations have raised issues with their board members, and in some cases with\nmanagers and attorneys\nhired by board members to serve associations. Residents have levied various\nallegations\n, including diversion of funds, withholding of financial records and retaliation against those who speak out.\nIn 2023, police arrested\nBen Dvir\n, former president of the Blue condo tower at 601 Northeast 36th Street in Miami\u2019s Edgewater, on allegations he instructed a tile vendor to inflate invoices and kept the markup for himself, according to an arrest affidavit. Court records show adjudication of guilt for Dvir was withheld, and he was placed on probation. A judge also ordered Dvir to pay nearly $33,000 in restitution, which equates to the amount he allegedly siphoned for himself through the scheme.",

The price works out to $3.5 million per acre.\nThe seller of the parcel, one of the largest designated for industrial outdoor storage uses in the region, was Oldcastle Infrastructure, a subsidiary of CRH, the world\u2019s largest building materials provider.\nOldcastle will lease the property, where it has been operating for more than 30 years.

Late last year, Alterra IOS, the industrial investment arm of Philadelphia-based Alterra Property Group, bought a 15-acre\nIOS yard in Jurupa Valley\nfor $51 million.

        "content": "Owner occupants are a bright spot in Houston\u2019s\nbattered office market\n.\nNet absorption rose for a second straight quarter,\nvacancy\ndipped slightly, and a string of massive owner-user deals removed more than 2 million square feet from the market this year, according to an analysis produced by Partners Real Estate and first\nreported\nby Bisnow.\nThe metro logged 654,000 square feet of positive\nabsorption\nin the third quarter, up from 415,000 square feet from the previous quarter, while vacancy ticked down to 26.3 percent.\nLeasing and renewals totaled 2.7 million square feet. The fourth quarter started with a splash: the city of Houston\u2019s $50 million purchase of the 51-story former Continental Airlines headquarters downtown at 1600 Smith Street.\nThat 1.1 million-square-foot acquisition will consolidate several city departments \u2014 including the police and public works \u2014 and relieve the city of two aging buildings on Travis and Walker streets, which officials plan to sell.\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the distress we\u2019ve seen, with lower valuations, a purchase like that maybe wouldn\u2019t have occurred,\u201d\nPartners Real Estate\n\u2019s Dan Boyles told the outlet. \u201cWhen there\u2019s low valuations, that helps justify a purchase in lieu of a lease.\u201d\nOwner-user deals \u2014 meaning deals where the business using the space buys the property rather than leasing it \u2014 have boosted Houston\u2019s sluggish office sector, where depressed values make buying more appealing than leasing.\nIn April, Dallas-based Energy Transfer acquired the 1.2 million-square-foot tower at\n5555 San Felipe Street\n, which Starwood Property Trust had foreclosed on in 2022 after Marathon Oil vacated.\nThe\npipeline giant\nwill relocate from its 510,000-square-foot headquarters at 1300 Main Street, which it plans to sell. The move doubles its footprint and fills a tower that was barely 30 percent leased.\nDespite the encouraging metrics, Boyles cautioned that Houston\u2019s office rebound still hinges on corporate growth and expansion \u2014 not just occupancy shuffling.\n\u201cThe real needle movers are when companies are expanding and growing into new space,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a lot of that.\u201d\nStill, activity is stirring. Among the quarter\u2019s largest leases were Seadrill\u2019s 69,000 square feet at Westway III, Adtalem Global Education\u2019s 31,000 square feet at Two Westway and Clifford Chance\u2019s 60,000-square-foot move into\nTexas Tower\n. Partners noted that smaller tenants are increasingly driving demand, even as large corporations remain cautious.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "One year later, here\u2019s how the FARE Act\u2026 has fared.\nThursday marks one year since the City Council approved the Fairness in Apartment Rental Expenses Act, which mandates that whoever hires a rental broker is responsible for paying said broker.\nWhat constitutes \u201chires\u201d has been a major point of contention. The law says if an agent publishes a listing with a landlord\u2019s blessing, that agent can\u2019t collect their fee from a tenant. The Real Estate Board of New York says this violates the First Amendment because it discourages a certain class of people (agents) from expressing a specific type of speech (in this case, listings).\nThe Council approved the measure on Nov. 13, 2024. The mayor signed the bill into law the following month. The law\u2019s rules went into effect June 11.\nGiven this first anniversary, my colleagues and I put together an\noverview\nof how the law has panned out so far.\nHere\u2019s the cheatsheet version:\nInventory:\nRental listings on StreetEasy have dropped year over year every month since the FARE Act went into effect. Median rent prices have also increased, more on a year-over-year basis than month-to-month. These shifts probably can\u2019t be entirely blamed on the FARE Act. Lack of supply and high demand are major factors.\nBrokerage:\nAgents are still adjusting to the new landscape. Notably, some are cutting rent-stabilized apartments out of their business entirely.\nLegal challenge\n: REBNY\u2019s lawsuit is ongoing. The trade group is waiting on a decision on its appeal to the Second Circuit.\nWhat\u2019s next\n: Council member Chi Oss\u00e9 says the law has given tenants more leverage in lease renewal negotiations, freeing them from the threat of paying thousands of dollars upfront if they move. He\u2019s confident that the future Mamdani administration will work to ramp up enforcement of the law, and said the City Council needs to help educate tenants on how to best document and prove violations.\nOf course, the law has only been active for five months. We\u2019ll have more to report as the law continues to reshape the city\u2019s rental market.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking abou\nt: Who is your pick for the next City Council speaker? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nOne year ago, I\nwrote\nabout Council member Chi Oss\u00e9\u2019s use of TikTok to mobilize more people to back the FARE Act.

        "content": "A\nlegal case trying to nullify the City of Yes\nrezoning was dismissed in Staten Island state court Wednesday.\nThe petitioners, which included 100 groups, City Council members, community board members and state lawmakers, accused the Adams administration of violating city and state environmental laws in pushing through\nthe plan\u2019s zoning changes\n.\nA judge, however, disagreed. The city\u2019s land-use approval process \u201cfunctioned as intended and created a voluminous and diverse record,\u201d Judge Lizette Colon wrote in her decision.\nThe dismissal is a victory for developers and the Adams administration. The petitioners hoped a decision in their favor would not only overturn the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity legislation, including a rezoning to allow for 80,000 more units, but would also nullify the two other parts of the City of Yes project. The two other bills address climate change and economic opportunity.\nPetitioners argued that the environmental impacts of the policy package were not appropriately studied. By segmenting the legislation in three sections, not providing alternatives and not proposing mitigation measures, the city failed to do a full environmental review as required by state law, they said.\nThe city responded by saying that since the goal was citywide housing production, it was impossible to provide mitigation measures or examine alternative ways to achieve the goal. Lawyers for the respondents also argued that the three City of Yes bills stand on their own, so they can be looked at in isolation.\nJack Lester, attorney for the petitioners, said he disagrees with the judge\u2019s interpretation of environmental law. Dismissing the lack of mitigation measures because the project is citywide runs contrary to the \u201cheart and soul\u201d of New York environmental law, he said via email. The law\u00a0 \u201censhrines reducing negative impacts into the basic tenets of the statute and 5 decades of judicial interpretation,\u201d he said.\nIn her conclusion, Judge Colon noted that many of the petitioners voiced their concerns about the zoning changes in the approval process.\n\u201c\u200b\u200bIt is not the place of the court to second-guess policy decisions, nor interject policy opinions into this review of [state environmental law] compliance,\u201d she wrote. \u201cRather, the court is merely here to confirm that respondents fulfilled their environmental review obligations under state and city law.\u201d\nPetitioners included conservative members of the city council, Robert Holden, Vickie Paladino, Joann Ariola and David Carr, as well as local civic groups and citywide advocates, such as the Met Council on Housing and the Black Institute.\n\u201cThis decision upholding \u2018City of Yes\u2019 in the face of a bogus challenge clears the way for New Yorkers to benefit from these long-overdue changes in the years ahead. In total, the Adams administration has planned, preserved, or created over 433,250 homes, because making housing more affordable for working New Yorkers has been our top priority,\u201d said a City Hall spokesperson in a statement.\u00a0\u201cEfforts by NIMBY opponents to stop City of Yes in the courts have died.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A seaside mansion in Malibu occupied by a longtime NHL player is on the market.\nFormer professional hockey defenseman Chris Chelios has listed his compound overlooking Paradise Cove beach for just under $60 million, Mansion Global\nreported\n. The nearly half-acre property at 28026 Sea Lane Drive first hit the market in early 2023 for $75 million. The listing is handled by Carl Gambino and John Bercsi of the Gambino Group at Compass.\nChelios, a three-time\nStanley Cup champion\n, bought the home with his wife,Tracee, in 2003 for $6 million as a vacation home. The property includes a nearly 3,800-square-foot main house with four bedrooms and five bathrooms as well as a beachside guesthouse. The lot has approximately 90 feet of ocean frontage.\nThe home was originally built in the early 1980s and has undergone renovations since then. The private property is tucked at the end of a secluded cul-de-sac and long gated driveway. Amenities in the three-story house include multiple fireplaces, an outdoor lounge and entertaining deck, an eat-in kitchen and breakfast nook, and a media and game room. The guesthouse comes with a kitchen of its own.\nWhether Chelios gets his price remains to be seen as Malibu continues to climb out of the ashes left by the Palisades Fire in January, The seaside city increasingly appears to\nbe a buyer\u2019s market\n. The City of Malibu has issued a handful of rebuilding permits in comparison to affected areas in the Pacific Palisades and Altadena, and many property owners who lost their homes have grown impatient. About 75 lots in Malibu have sold since the fire, but sales are slowing; of the 160 lots in Malibu listed this year that are still on the market, 47 have gotten a price cut.\n\u201cSupply is exceeding demand, and lots are selling anywhere from a 20 to 60 percent discount,\u201d local builder Abe Roy\ntold\nthe Los Angeles Times. \u201cThat\u2019s a premonition for a freefall.\u201d\nThis summer, for example, a mansion at\n29130 Cliffside Drive\nsold for $49.8 million, down from the original listing price of $65 million.

        "content": "Evanston\u2019s skyline is set for a new peak.\nThe City Council narrowly approved plans for a 29-story, 419-unit apartment building at 605 Davis Street, a project that will eclipse Orrington Plaza as the suburb\u2019s tallest building, Evanston Now\nreported\n.\nThe proposal from\nVermilion Development\n, Campbell Coyle and partners passed Monday night, ending more than a decade of\nback-and-forth\nover the downtown site.\nThe fully electric building will rise 299 feet and is slated for completion by early 2028. Developers trimmed the original\n31-story plan\nto win over skeptical council members, cutting a parking level and one floor of apartments to reduce the height and unit count. The revised plan includes one level of parking, ground-floor retail, and a mix of studio, one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments.\nTwenty percent of the units \u2014 84 in total \u2014 will be set aside as affordable housing, qualifying the project for Cook County\u2019s Affordable Housing Special Assessment Program. The incentive offers steep property tax breaks phased in over 30 years, a point of contention among opponents who say it\u2019s too generous for a high-end development.\n\u201cThis is a giveaway,\u201d said Alderman Clare Kelly, whose ward includes the site. She decried what she called \u201cextreme zoning variances\u201d and \u201claughable community benefits,\u201d pushing unsuccessfully to delay the vote for more negotiations.\nSupporters countered that the development will add needed housing and bolster the city\u2019s tax base. Alderman Jonathan Nieuwsma along with Alderman Bobby Burns called the project an opportunity that couldn\u2019t be passed on and added that tax revenue will start benefiting local schools within a few years, calling claims of a burden on taxpayers unfounded.\nThe city also struck a deal to lease 153 parking spaces in a municipal garage to the developers for about $211,000 annually, while requiring upfront permit payments instead of deferred fees. Construction is expected to begin in the spring.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The stakeholders were the only bidders in the public auction on Wednesday for the city\u2019s largest shopping center.\nThe $133 million minimum bid is below the property\u2019s latest assessed value of about $145 million \u2014 quite a stumble from its 2016 valuation of $1.2 billion. The lenders will tap CBRE to market the property for sale, hoping to start fielding offers early next year.\nCBRE said a new investor could come in and breathe new life into the retail center or redevelop it at a maximum of the existing 400-foot height limit. It\nwon\u2019t, however, be turned into housing\n, as the floor plans of the mall present legal hurdles too high to overcome to build residences.\nPrevious owners Westfield Corporation, Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield and Brookfield Properties gave up their ownership in 2023 while owing lenders $625.6 million at the time. The lenders fought back with a lawsuit against Brookfield and Westfield after they ceased making payments on a $558 million loan backed by the 1.2 million-square-foot mall. Trident Pacific Real Estate Group was later appointed as the property\u2019s receiver.\nIn the two years since then, restaurants and retailers\nfled the mall in droves\n.\nNordstrom\nannounced in 2023 it would close its 312,000-square-foot store at the mall, and earlier this year,\nBloomingdale\u2019s\nclosed its 339,000-square-foot flagship at the property, more than two decades ahead of its 2046 lease expiration. Clothing retailers like Zara, Madewell, J. Crew, Lucky Brand and Aldo and eateries like Jamba Juice and Blondie\u2019s Pizza have closed their doors, leaving just Panda Express and Shake Shack in the food court.\nFoot traffic at the mall has also dipped\nsignificantly, falling 63.3 percent from 2019 to 2024.

        "content": "NRG Park\u2019s landlord is finally putting money toward upgrades at Houston\u2019s\nmassive entertainment and sports complex\n.\nThe Harris County Sports and Convention Corporation approved a draft capital improvement plan last month, outlining $55 million in projects meant to chip away at a staggering $1.9 billion backlog of deferred maintenance identified last year, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe board also greenlit $2.5 million for design proposals tied to the highest-priority items, HCSCC\u2019s director of projects Jacob Frazelle said during the meeting.\n\u201cOur goal was not just to have a report \u2014 we want to have a plan of action behind it,\u201d said executive director and CEO Matye Kendrick.\nThe first project will focus on repairing elevators and escalators ahead of the 2026 FIFA\nWorld Cup\n. NRG Stadium, home of the Houston Texans of the NFL as well as the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, is slated to host seven matches during the international tournament, drawing tens of thousands of fans to a facility that\u2019s now more than 20 years old.\nBeyond that, officials have offered few details.\nHCSCC declined the outlet\u2019s interview requests, saying only that \u201cplanning is continuing to progress\u201d and that more information will be shared once the plan is finalized. The organization referred public records requests to the Texas attorney general\u2019s office.\nFunding is a key question.\nFrazelle told the board that HCSCC\u2019s budget can only handle short-term projects, and that the group will need to petition\nHarris County\nCommissioners Court for money to complete the plan.\nThe move comes amid lease negotiations between the county, the Texans and the rodeo and a broader master-planning effort for NRG Park\u2019s future. Both tenants\u2019 leases expire in 2032, putting pressure on the county to clarify long-term renovation and redevelopment goals.\nEarlier this year, HCSCC hired legal and consulting firms to assist with a design prioritization study meant to assess the profitability and feasibility of potential upgrades to NRG Stadium and NRG Center. That work, initially expected to wrap by August, has been delayed.\nTwo separate studies for the long dormant\nAstrodome\nnext door to NRG Stadium, including one evaluating minimal restoration costs and another weighing demolition, have also fallen behind schedule.\nWhile the capital plan represents early momentum, HCSCC\u2019s challenge is vast: transforming an aging complex into a modern, revenue-generating campus before its next big deadline arrives, and that could be soon: the first\nHouston\ngroup stage matches for the 2026 World Cup slated for NRG Park begin mid-June.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Two key parties in Michael Shvo\u2019s no good, very bad year are back with combined claims against the developer.\nA new lawsuit accuses Shvo, who made a\ndramatic exit from a trophy Miami project\nand\nfended off lawsuits\nat a number of his developments, of being engaged in a yearslong Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) conspiracy.\nThe lawsuit was filed by some familiar foes for Shvo, including the Core Club and its founder and CEO Jennie Enterprise, and two disgruntled residents at\nShvo\u2019s troubled Mandarin Oriental condo project\nat 685 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.\nThe parties combined their claims in a lawsuit filed this week, which alleges that Shvo, along with a German government-backed pension fund, lured \u201cinvestors, condo purchasers, tenants, and business partners into multi-million dollar transactions, the proceeds of which were diverted to enrich Shvo and his associates, and to fund their lavish lifestyles.\u201d\nThe suit details the formation of a partnership, called BSD, between Shvo, the pension fund BVK and the Deutsche Finance Group, who are both also named as defendants, and Serdar Bilgili\u2019s BLG Capital, which it claims left the venture after becoming suspicious of \u201cmillions of dollars in improper expenses\u201d charged by the developer.\nThe complaint claims that Shvo charged personal expenses like private jet travel, a $30,000-per-month apartment and work done on his private yacht to the venture, which was responsible for developing projects around New York City and San Francisco.\nThe filing comes months after a a New York state judge decided the owners of Core Club\nowe Shvo nearly $1 million over a 2022 loan\n.\nA lawyer for Shvo in a statement dismissed the suit as a \u201cdesperate attempt\u201d by the Core owners \u201cfrantically trying to avoid paying more than $3.5 million in owed rent\u201d and claimed a \u201cthird-party audit\u201d had already probed their claims about expenses.\nA partnership gone wrong\nThe complaint expands on the\nsoured relationship between Core Club\nand its co-founder and CEO, Jennie Enterprise.\nEnterprise agreed to move the club\u2019s New York City headquarters to Shvo\u2019s building at 711 Fifth Avenue, sign a lease at Shvo\u2019s Transamerica Building and execute a promissory note and option agreement that could give Shvo a 50 percent stake in Core following being approached by Shvo in early 2020.\nDuring this period, Enterprise was also pursuing a Milan expansion of the club, according to the complaint. Shvo said that he would fund all aspects of a three-club deal in New York, San Francisco and Milan and presented Core with a 10-year expansion strategy forecasting revenues of $159 million by 2030, according to the complaint. Shvo allegedly said he would contribute $100 million in capital to building out the clubs.\nThe lawsuit claims that despite Shvo assuring Enterprise that their interests were aligned, Shvo was set to receive a $27 million \u201cpromote\u201d fee from the BSD Partnership contingent on Core signing a lease in New York.\nIn 2021, Core signed leases at Shvo\u2019s New York and San Francisco properties and in 2022, took out a $1 million loan with an option for an entity tied to Shvo to purchase half of Core\u2019s membership interests.\nThe complaint claims that Shvo had never intended to deliver the clubs as promised in San Francisco and Milan, with the team considering them \u201cfake\u201d projects and that the headquarters in New York was turned over late and \u201cin an unfinished and highly defective condition.\u201d\nCore claims that a club member was trapped in an elevator and another was injured when a wooden beam collapsed.\nThe complaint also claims that Shvo took out complimentary memberships \u2014 which cost $100,000 \u2014 for himself, his wife, his attorney Morris Missry and his attorney\u2019s wife, among others.\nIt also claims that Shvo forced Core to hold several private functions in the space, including the Commercial Observer Gala Reception on Sept. 19, 2023, and a dinner for his daughter\u2019s Orthodox school community two months later. Core claims Shvo held 12 different Torah study and dinner events in 2024.\nShvo was also verbally abusive to club employees, calling an employee a \u201cfucking idiot\u201d when a server at the club\u2019s restaurant led him to the wrong table, according to the lawsuit.\nBecause of the unexpected expenses incurred for Core as a result of Shvo\u2019s alleged behavior, the club was forced to draw on its credit line with Shvo, triggering his ability to purchase 50 percent of the club\u2019s membership interests, according to the lawsuit. Shvo has proposed a closing date of Nov. 21, the complaint states.\nDisgruntled buyers\nThe other plaintiffs in the complaint, John and Diane Goodman, repeated claims made in state court that they were misled by Shvo on their way to purchase a unit at the Mandarin Oriental for $6.1 million.\nThe Goodmans\nfiled a lawsuit last March\nclaiming that Shvo failed to deliver on some of the unit\u2019s finishing touches and refused to do so once alerted.\nA judge dismissed the claims\nagainst Shvo as an individual, but allowed the claims against the development entity to continue.\nThe Goodmans followed up with another lawsuit in July, claiming that the developers of the Mandarin Oriental delivered unfinished amenities and a rooftop \u201ctransformed into a wasteland of dead foliage and an algae-infested pool.\u201d\nShvo was reported in September to be\nconsidering a bulk sale\nat the development, which had sold fewer than a third of its 65 units four years after launching. A spokesperson for the developer confirmed the potential bulk sale, a year after the project\nsecured a $120 million inventory loan\nwith only 15 units sold.\nIn the most recent complaint, the Goodmans claimed their unit was burglarized twice and that the condo building was infested with roaches traveling through the pipes of vacant units.\nThe Goodmans also claim that Shvo used the facilities at the Mandarin Oriental for personal reasons, including hosting a \u201cloud, private late-night concert by Greek singer Antonis Remos\u201d in the restaurant in June 2024.\nShvo\u2019s attorneys responded to the July lawsuit by calling for its dismissal, and dismissed it as \u201ca kitchen sink of frivolous claims\u201d and \u201ca public hit job.\u201d",

        "content": "Nine single-family homes are on the market in South Florida asking $100 million or more.\nAs the tri-county region\u2019s busy season for real estate sales ramps up, sellers in the upper echelons of the market are looking to capitalize on demand for large, waterfront estates in prime neighborhoods. In the last week, three estates asking $185 million or more made their debut.\nSellers are seeking unprecedented prices for sprawling compounds that include amenities like shooting ranges, bowling alleys, jazz lounges, theaters, spas, gyms and massive garages for storing and displaying car collections.\nNine-digit asking prices range as high as $285 million for these homes, some of which are teardowns or incomplete construction projects. While South Florida has repeatedly shattered price records since the pandemic catalyzed a luxury real estate boom, billionaire Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison holds the region\u2019s price record:\nhis $173 million purchase of a 16-acre Manalapan estate\nin 2022. The billionaire DeGroote family set the Florida state record this year, when they sold their waterfront Naples estate for\n$225 million\nin April.\nHere\u2019s a look at the nine South Florida trophy properties asking $100 million or more this season:\n$285M | 1960 South Ocean Boulevard, Manalapan | Seller: Stewart Satter\nStewart Satter, the former mayor of Manalapan and a spec developer, is\nasking $285 million\nfor this 4-acre compound that spans from the ocean to the Intracoastal Waterway. It is next door to Ellison\u2019s $173 million compound, and Satter bought the site for\n$27.5 million\nlast year.\nHe is planning a nearly 55,000-square-foot estate with a shooting range, bowling alley, car museum, boat house, guest house, beach house, theater golf simulator, padel court, gym and spa, the listing shows. The main house will have eight bedrooms, nine bathrooms, seven half-bathrooms and two kitchens.\nSatter tapped Choeff Levy Fischman to design the compound, Robert Burrage of RWB Construction Management as the contractor, and Mark Tremblay of Marc-Michaels Interior Design for the interiors. Nick Malinosky with Douglas Elliman\u2019s Exclusive Group has the listing.\n$205M | 1491 North Ocean Boulevard, Palm Beach | Seller: Estate of Frank and Maureen Wilkens\nNew to the market is the 4.8-acre oceanfront Palm Beach estate of the late Frank and Maureen Wilkens,\nasking $205 million\n. Once owned by Aldo Gucci, the couple bought the property for $14 million in 2002 and completed construction in 2005. The 14,500-square-foot main house has six bedrooms, six bathrooms and one half-bathroom. The estate also includes a two-bedroom guest house with two and a half bathrooms, a pool house, two pools and 230 feet of beachfront.\nChristian Angle with Christian Angle Real Estate has the listing, which is the most expensive on-market listing in Palm Beach so far this season.\n$200M | 7 Indian Creek Island Road, Indian Creek | Seller: Dr. Aaron and Marine Rollins\nThe most expensive listing in Miami-Dade County is Dr. Aaron and Marine Rollins\u2019 incomplete 28,000-square-foot Indian Creek mansion. The couple bought the property for\n$30 million\nin 2020 and tapped Ontario-based Ferris Rafauli to design the estate, which will include nine bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, four half-bathrooms, spa facilities, a salon, theater, library, jazz lounge and a 1,500-gallon aquarium when it is finished. The property will also include a pool, a 135-foot dock and 200 feet of waterfront.\nThey listed the waterfront\n1.8-acre compound, asking $200 million\n, earlier this week with Jill, Danny and Hillary Hertzberg of the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker Realty.\n$200M | 1980 South Ocean Boulevard, Palm Beach | Seller: Nathan Silverstein\nNathan Silverstein, a real estate investor and lawyer, has owned these 2.3 undeveloped acres since 1966. He first listed the land for sale in 2022, asking $150 million. Since then, he tapped New York-based architecture firm Fairfax &amp; Sammons to design a 20,000-square-foot mansion and secured approval from Palm Beach\u2019s Architectural Review Commission, a move agents say makes vacant land more appealing to buyers.\nShelley Newman with the Corcoran Group has the listing, which returned to the market in February asking $200 million.\n$185M | 911 North Ocean Boulevard, Manalapan | Seller: Estate of Joan and Murray Goodman\nThe longtime oceanfront home of late real estate developer Murray Goodman and his wife, Joanie Goodman, hit the market earlier this month as a teardown,\nasking $185 million\n.

The partners are tearing down the existing 19,000-square-foot mansion and have relisted the land for $169 million. If no interested buyer emerges for the lot, the partners have hired Domo Architecture + Design to design a 35,000-square-foot mansion that will be priced at $300 million. It will include a movie theater, spa facilities, a fitness center, pickleball and paddle courts, two pools and a 27-car underground garage.\nIt has 290 feet of waterfront, and Nelson Gonzalez of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty has the listing.\n$150M | 1370 South Ocean Boulevard, Manalapan | Seller: Chris Rokos\nChris Rokos, the billionaire founder of London-based Rokos Capital Management, is asking $150 million for his 2.8-acre ocean-to-Intracoastal Manalapan estate. He has a net worth of $2.3 billion, according to Forbes. Records show he bought the compound for $40 million in 2017. The 18,400-square-foot mansion was built in 1972 and renovated in 2015. It includes nine bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, five half-bathrooms, fitness and spa facilities, a billiard room, game room, theater and a 10-car garage with a club room, according to records and the listing.\nMarc-Michaels Interior Design handled the interiors, and it is being marketed fully furnished by listing agent Jack Elkins with William Raveis Real Estate.\n$134M | 820 South Ocean Boulevard, Manalapan | Seller: Randal J.

It also has 215 feet of oceanfront and a dock.\nKirk, who has a net worth of $1.6 billion according to Forbes, tapped Margit Brandt with Premier Estate Properties to list the estate in September.\n$115M | 3585 Anchorage Way, Miami | Seller: Estate of Jonathan Lewis\nThe estate of Progressive Insurance heir Jonathan Lewis listed Banyan Ridge, the late Lewis\u2019 4.5-acre waterfront Coconut Grove estate, for $115 million.

Krehbiel, who died in 2022, was a Lake Forest socialite, philanthropist and gardener. She was the ex-wife of John Krehbiel Jr., the co-chairman of electronics company Molex, which Koch Industries bought in 2013.\n\u201cHer house and its gardens were sort of legendary among people in the world of gardening and collecting and antiques in Chicago,\u201d said Corbin Horn, vice president and senior specialist at Freeman\u2019s.\nThe mansion at 930 East Rosemary Road in Lake Forest, designed in 1912 by Benjamin H. Marshall and expanded by Thomas Beeby in 1996, has housed a lineage of Chicago business leaders, including John T Pirie, president of Carson Pirie Scott &amp; Co. and Laurance Armour Jr. of the Armour meat packing dynasty.\nThe Krehbiels bought neighboring parcels to expand the property to nine acres, which Posy Krehbiel used for lush gardening displays. The house also included a glass-paned indoor conservatory.\nThe house sold in October for $11 million, after first hitting the market in\nAugust 2024 asking $15 million\n.\nAnn Lyon with @properties\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate represented Krehbiel\u2019s estate in the sale, while Amanda McCmillan and Andra O\u2019Neill, also with @properties, represented the buyers. Property records that could indicate the home\u2019s buyers are not available.\nThe auction will give a window into the high end collection and design pieces Krehbiel put together during her time at the estate. The collection of 450 lots includes a wide selection of antique European furniture, like a 19th-century North European marble-top table valued between $5,000 and $7,000 and a 20th-century pair of Swedish neoclassical painted cabinets valued between $3,000 and $5,000. The collection also reflects Krehbiel\u2019s gardening interests, with many pieces adorned with floral patterns and leaves, Horn said.\nOne set of 213 lots will be auctioned off live on Dec. 10 at Freeman\u2019s auction house in the West Loop. The other 250 lots are available at an online auction that is running through Dec. 12. The size of the auction is notable for Freeman\u2019s, Horn said. The auction house often combines the property of multiple homeowners into one sale, but for Krehbiel\u2019s collection it went with a dedicated auction.\n\u201cWhen we encounter a collection that is so great, or a house that is so large, it\u2019s a consignment that is worthy of a whole auction just for that homeowner,\u201d Horn said.\nSome of the house\u2019s interior design was done by English firm Colefax &amp; Fowler, which specializes in the English country house aesthetic.\n\u201cTo people who are enthusiasts of that style of decorating and of the kind of antiques that are used in Colefax interiors, that adds to the appeal of some of this collection,\u201d Horn said.\n",

        "content": "Chetrit Group\u2019s waterfront condo development site in Pompano Beach and its units at the Hollywood Beach Resort condo are headed to a Uniform Commercial Code foreclosure auction.\nThe lender that provided a $17.2 million loan on both properties in 2022 filed for the UCC foreclosure, according to a public notice published in the South Florida Sun Sentinel and\nFloridaPublicNotices.com\n. The auction will be held on Dec. 22, seeking to generate $21.7 million to cover the debt\u2019s principal, interest, default interest and reasonable fees and costs.\nUCC auctions are non-judicial processes in which the ownership interest in the entities that own properties is sold, meaning the winning bidder assumes ownership of the limited liability company holding the real estate. Generally, mezzanine lenders file for UCC foreclosures, which proceed faster than traditional foreclosures that can drag through the courts.\nChetrit\u2019s properties are the 2.5-acre vacant Pompano Beach site at 2507 and 2629 North Ocean Boulevard and 102 condo units at the Hollywood Beach Resort at 101 North Ocean Drive, according to property records. The firm has long planned a\n121-unit condo project\non the Pompano Beach site with a 20-slip marina. Construction hasn\u2019t started, records show.\nJoseph Chetrit declined to comment.\nBorrowers can work out forbearance agreements with lenders by extending loan maturities or securing equity partners, often to postpone auctions to give them more time to come up with capital.\nBoth sites are encumbered with debt from New York-based Madison Realty Capital, led by Josh Zegen, Brian Shatz and Adam Tantleff. In 2022, Madison provided Chetrit with a\n$94 million\nloan on the Pompano Beach property and a\n$78 million\nloan to purchase the Hollywood Beach Resort units.\nLast year, Chetrit avoided a UCC foreclosure attempt by Madison on the loans by chipping in a significant amount of capital to refinance the debt, extending the Pompano Beach financing by six months and the Hollywood Beach Resort financing by a year, a source told\nThe Real Deal\nat the time.\nMadison declined to comment.\nMadison has been a frequent lender to Chetrit. In 2021, it provided a\n$310 million\nconstruction loan for Chetrit\u2019s planned 4 million-square-foot project on the Miami River that at full buildout would include 1,900 apartments and condos; 39,000 square feet of retail, office space; a 17-slip marina and 770 parking spaces.\nThe first phase, consisting of a 54-story, 632-unit luxury apartment tower on the site at 275 Southwest Sixth Street in Miami, is nearly completed.\nThis year, Adam Neumann\u2019s Flow, Canada Global and billionaire Yakir Gabay\u2019s Yellowstone Trust bought a\npartnership stake\nin the Miami River project. Chetrit kept a \u201csignificant minority\u201d stake.",

New York-based 601W was reported to\nbe in contract\nto buy the building in September, but Werner\u2019s involvement was not disclosed at the time.\nThe deal breaks down to $310 per square foot. JPMorgan Chase provided a $100 million balance sheet loan to finance the acquisition.\nA Newmark team including Adam Spies, Doug Harmon and Adam Doneger arranged the sale, while the firm\u2019s Jordan Roeshlaub and Nick Scribani led the way on financing.\nTenants at the office building include the City University of New York, Fedcap Rehabilitation Services and the United Way of New York City. Ownership completed a $15 million renovation in 2013, upgrading elevators and updating the Art Deco-style lobby. There are more than 3,600 square feet of green roofs as well as retail space on the ground floor. The building also benefits from its proximity to Grand Central Terminal.\nDurst patriarch Joseph Durst bought the building for his nascent real estate empire more than 80 years ago. The 532,000-square-foot, 21-story property was developed in 1927 and designed by Starrett &amp; Van Vleck.\nIts future may not be as an office building, though. The incoming owners are considering a partial conversion of the property. The upper floors of the building, which are vacant, could work for residential use; alternatively, they could be transformed into a contiguous block for a dedicated office tenant.\nWerner and 601W did not respond to the publication\u2019s requests for comment.\nWerner, of course, is no stranger to office-to-residential conversion, including in Midtown East.\nThe investor partnered with Nathan Berman\u2019s Metro Loft Management on a\nconversion\nat 675 Third Avenue, another former Durst property that traded for nine figures. The conversion plans call for a 464-unit building spanning 321,000 square feet.\nThe two are also partners at 235 East 42nd Street, where they are transforming the former Pfizer headquarters into 1,500 rental units, the largest office-to-residential conversion in New York City.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Sonder\u2019s\nsudden implosion\nthis week is spilling over into the New York real estate world.\nThe Moinian family, among the city\u2019s most prominent landlords, sued the collapsed hospitality firm for at least $10 million in damages and is moving to retake control of two Manhattan properties leased to Sonder that have descended into turmoil since the company\u2019s shutdown, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe lawsuit, filed Tuesday in state Supreme Court in Manhattan, claims that guests at the Moinians\u2019 buildings \u2014 2 Washington Street in the Financial District and 37 West 24th Street in NoMad \u2014 have either refused to vacate their rooms or been locked out and unable to retrieve their belongings after Sonder shuttered operations Monday afternoon.\nThe family accuses Sonder of abandoning the sites and leaving them to deal with the fallout as the San Francisco-based company heads toward bankruptcy.\nAt the center of the Moinians\u2019 claim are two Sonder-run properties totaling about 400 units. Joseph Moinian\u2019s group leased 14 floors at 2 Washington under a 10-year deal signed in 2020 for roughly $1.3 million a month, according to filings, while his brother Morris of Fortuna Realty Group owns the 120-room property at 37 West 24th, formerly the Hotel Henri. Both landlords say they\u2019ve been left with unpaid rent as Sonder unraveled.\nSonder, once touted as an alternative to Airbnb, collapsed after Marriott International terminated a key partnership,\nciting a default\nunder a 2024 licensing deal. Interim CEO Janice Sears said the firm was \u201cdevastated\u201d to liquidate after costly integration delays with Marriott\u2019s systems and a steep revenue slide.\nThe fallout extends beyond the Moinians. Sonder operated roughly 10 Manhattan locations, including buildings owned by Silverstein Properties, BLDG Management and the Chehebar family, all left grappling with stranded guests and uncertain lease obligations.\nFor landlords, Sonder\u2019s collapse underscores the risks of the master-lease model that fueled its growth during the short-term rental boom. The company\u2019s Chapter 7 filing could take months, leaving high-profile owners caught in limbo over how \u2014 and when \u2014 they can reclaim their assets.\nNeither the Moinians\u2019 attorney nor a family spokesperson commented to the publication by press time. Sonder did not respond to requests for comment.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Austin\nhas a strong infrastructure for off-market deals, but a\nsea change\nin the housing market is starting to erode it.\nThanks to permissive state laws, high local taxes and, according to agents, a local real estate board that\u2019s willing to look the other way,\nAustin has developed a robust network for private luxury sales\n, including central platforms like Clubhouse and the Austin Luxury Network.\nHowever, market conditions are forcing sellers and agents to gauge the costs and benefits of privacy. As a result, more homes that would have traded off market in previous years are now trickling to the MLS, agents say.\nAn off-market oasis\nClubhouse and ALN aren\u2019t the only subscription-based private listing sites in Austin, but they\u2019re perhaps the most prominent. Each has hundreds of users \u2014 a fraction of the tens of thousands of agents in Austin, but a sizable contingent compared to similar groups in other cities.\n\u201cIn other markets, both in Texas and elsewhere in the country, deals are being done off market. It\u2019s just much more underground, and there isn\u2019t necessarily this one unified space,\u201d Clubhouse co-founder Justin Shapiro said.\nThat\u2019s because agents don\u2019t want to risk\npunishment from their local board of Realtors\n, Shapiro said. That\u2019s less of a concern in Austin.\n\u201cTo our knowledge, the Austin Board of Realtors is well aware of Clubhouse and Austin Luxury Network and other platforms, and they seem to be fine with it,\u201d Shapiro said.\nDouglas Elliman agent Michael Reisor, who works in New York as well as Austin and regularly handles off-market transactions, agreed.\n\u201cOff-market is used by a significant number of agents in the city,\u201d Reisor said. \u201cAustin\u2019s off-market scene is pretty robust compared to others.\u201d\nEmpowered by a lenient board, Austin\u2019s not-so-black market also meets a strong local demand for private listings. Texas doesn\u2019t require parties to\ndisclose sale prices\n, and Austin has some of the highest property taxes in the state. As a result, Austin luxury sellers have a strong incentive to hide the true value of their home from the tax appraiser.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re paying 2.5, 3 percent on your valuation, and all of a sudden you record a sale for $11 million \u2014 yikes,\u201d said Douglas Elliman agent Jeanne Parker.\nConsequently, most Austin homes above $2 million and almost all homes above $10 million have generally sold privately, said Douglas Elliman agent Jeff Burke and other agents.\nDrying up\nThere are 400 single-family homes and condos asking at least $1.5 million on the Austin Luxury Network, one user said. There are about a thousand such properties for sale in the same areas on the Austin MLS, meaning ALN accounts for about 30 percent of the total share of listings. Homes on Clubhouse make up another percentage.\nThis share of off-market sales has likely shrunk since last year, and certainly since the resi boom of 2021.\n\u201cYour ultra-luxury listings just aren\u2019t selling like they used to,\u201d said Clubhouse co-founder Alissa Shapiro.\nAustin is a buyer\u2019s market\n. The city has been pushing 6 months inventory throughout 2025, marking the\nhighest level of supply since 2011\n. It had the highest ratio of sellers to buyers in the country last month, according to\nRedfin\n. It also tied with Houston for the\ngreatest decrease in median home price in the country\n, according to CoStar.\nAs a result, some Austin sellers are giving up on off-market networks.\n\u201cAgents and sellers are looking for maximum exposure right now because the market is slower,\u201d Burke said.\nMore properties are moving to the MLS after lingering on ALN, agents including Burke and Parker said.\nOn the other hand, at least some of these moves are planned. Many agents use ALN and Clubhouse to present coming-soon properties to eligible buyers before a public launch, according to Jackson.\n\u201cPeople use these platforms to test price,\u201d said Katie Jackson, an agent at @properties Lone Star Christie\u2019s International Real Estate in Austin.\nClubhouse declined to share data about listings or deals.\n\u201cWe have new agents joining every week, which, to me, is a testament to the fact that they are utilizing platforms like ours to get deals done,\u201d Justin Shapiro said.\n",

        "content": "Rents are softening across the country. But New York City is not the rest of the country.\nRent in the city stayed elevated in October despite expected seasonal trends and\ncooling mortgage rates\n. Median rent for a new, brokered, market-rate lease in Manhattan was $4,600 in October, according to a monthly report from appraisal firm Miller Samuel for Douglas Elliman.\nThat was a\n$50 increase from September\n, but a 7 percent increase year-over-year.\nAlthough rents have come down across the country, New York City rents have been buoyed by a strong local economy, said report author Jonathan Miller.\nRents that rise faster than inflation may be good for landlords who are seeing expenses grow. But elevated rents have also contributed to affordability concerns, a cornerstone of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani\u2019s successful campaign.\n\u201cRents are still growing at more than twice the rate of inflation,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThat encapsulates the affordability crisis in housing perfectly.\u201d\nManhattan\u2019s median rent reached a record in February\nand remained high through the summer,\nclimbing to a $4,700 peak in July\n. That was likely in part due to elevated mortgage rates keeping would-be buyers in the rental market, Miller said.\nThe trend has been similar in Brooklyn and Northwest Queens. Median rents for a new, brokered, market-rate lease in those areas reached $3,850 and $3,598 in October, respectively. Median rents grew by 6.9 percent year-over-year in Brooklyn and 7.4 percent year-over-year in Northwest Queens.\nAlthough median rents usually fall in the city with cooler weather and flagging demand, that hasn\u2019t quite come to pass. October matched August\u2019s median for the third-highest Manhattan rent on record. Nearly 18 percent of Manhattan leases were signed after a bidding war, up a percentage point from a year ago.\nThat\u2019s in contrast to the national trend. Rising unemployment and moderating wage growth are contributing to softer demand. GDP has grown, but\nlargely driven by AI-related capital expenditures\n, according to a report from JPMorgan. Add in the rise of development seen in the last few years, and you have a recipe for lower rents.\nBut the Big Apple has fared better. The securities industry, which powers a good portion of the city\u2019s economy, continues to bring in\nrecord profits\n, according to the state comptroller\u2019s office. That may be contributing to a sharp rise in prices for Manhattan\u2019s luxury market: The top decile of listings has seen median rents rise 20 percent since last October, coming to $11,995.\nWith the election in the books and Mamdani headed to Gracie Mansion, some uncertainty has been eliminated from the housing market, Miller said. Mamdani made promoting affordability for renters a key part of his mayoral campaign and has pledged to use his\nsway over the Rent Guidelines Board to freeze prices\nin rent-stabilized apartments, nearly half of the city housing stock.\nAlthough that would increase affordability for those tenants, it would also likely lead to accelerated rent growth in market-rate apartments, Miller said. Landlords, who are facing steep inflation in their expenses, will attempt to make up the difference in net income on any market-rate units they own.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still looking at upward pressure in rents going forward,\u201d Miller said, \u201cno matter how the economy performs.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Multifamily construction activity in New York City\nis contending with record lows\n\u2014 but could be showing some signs of life.\nThe third quarter of 2025 saw the lowest number of multifamily construction starts in the city since 2011, according to CoStar data shared with\nThe Real Deal\n. Only 894 units began foundation work last quarter.\nHowever, the number of units proposed by developers surged in the same period, according to separate data from the Real Estate Board of New York published Wednesday. Developers filed permits for 11,746 multifamily units in the period, a 69 percent increase from the prior quarter.\nThat number is the highest since the first quarter of 2022 and approaching the number of units that would need to be built each quarter to reach the city and state\u2019s\nmoonshot housing goal of 500,000 new homes\n.\nTo be sure, not all of those proposed units are likely to be built. Developers often face financial and legal hurdles in the time between filing permit applications for a project and starting the foundation.\nBut the boost in filings likely reflects how city and state policies are encouraging new housing, said Henry Perez-Tlatenchi, senior data and policy researcher at REBNY.\n\u201cYou\u2019re starting to see a jump start of people who were essentially waiting for the economics of development to work out,\u201d said Perez-Tlatenchi.\nPart of the resurgence in proposed multifamily construction is the return of a tax abatement program for rental housing.\nProposed rental units peaked in early 2022, as developers raced to qualify sites\nfor the 421-a tax abatement program\n, which paused property taxes for certain rental buildings that had started construction by that summer.\nBut unit proposals flagged after that, as developers faced an uncertain tax future. In late 2024, the\nstate passed the 485-x tax abatement program\n, which has since restarted the development pipeline.\nOther city and state policies, including those proposed in\nMayor Eric Adams\u2019 City of Yes plan\n, have encouraged density and, thus, more unit proposals.\n\u201cWe know that permits will eventually lead to some more units,\u201d said Victor Rodriguez, senior director of analytics at CoStar. \u201cBut the biggest question is, how many and when?\u201d\nAnd, despite the overall resurgence of filings, the pipeline for large-scale development appears to have taken a hit. Of the 207 multifamily buildings proposed last quarter, only 12 were planned for more than 100 units.\nThat\u2019s largely due to\nthe specifics of the new 485-x program\n, according to Perez-Tlatenchi. Developers planning to build more than 100 units need to comply with construction wage requirements to participate in the tax program. That adds compliance costs, and for really large buildings, makes projects difficult to pencil out.\nRental projects of 150 units or more in high-demand areas of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens need to pay construction workers either $64 and $74 per hour to participate in the program, depending on location. That increases costs by 29 percent in Williamsburg, Greenpoint and Long Island City over the previous tax incentive program, according to REBNY estimates.\nAlthough midsize development powered the city to approach its housing goals this quarter, that might not continue, Perez-Tlatenchi said.\n\u201cHistorically, what has driven our residential development, and the numbers behind that, has been large-scale development,\u201d Perez-Tlatenchi said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s clear that\u2019s not happening.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The Beverly Hills Estates plans to open an office in the Pacific Palisades as it expands its presence amid ramped rebuilding post wildfires.\nJacqueline Chernov\n, who joined the brokerage in\nMarch\nfrom Compass, will head the office, which is called the Palisades Estates.\nChernov\nhinted at the business division when she made the jump to the brokerage in July. It will start with an Airstream trailer located on a lot owned by Chernov in the Alphabet Streets.\nThe unconventional workspace is in line with the Beverly Hills Estates, which dubs itself as a social club over simply a brokerage. Its West Hollywood headquarters boasts plush booth-style seating in the office\u2019s center common area, along with an in-house caf\u00e9 offering smoothies, coffee and pastries to agents and guests.\nThe Airstream will be set up in the next month in a neighborhood that was one of the\nhardest hit by January\u2019s Palisades Fire\n. Chernov also has a home in the Huntington neighborhood, which she\u2019s working with a contractor on to rebuild within the next 14 to 16 months.\nRayni Williams, co-founder and CEO of the Beverly Hills Estates, said the brokerage has always been keen on Los Angeles\u2019 Westside. Chernov has been a \u201cgo-to, favorite\u201d area agent that the two have worked with even prior to her joining the company.\nChernov said the brokerage is looking for permanent office space on Sunset Boulevard, near the Erewhon inside Rick Caruso\u2019s\nPalisades Village\nshopping center, which would place the Palisades Estates in the center of town.\nThat\u2019s also near where Sotheby\u2019s International Realty has an office, which reopened in late September. Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices California Properties also had an office in the center of town on nearby Alma Real Drive.\nThe goal is to build out an office specializing in land, teardowns, rebuild sites and connections to architects and builders, among other services. Chernov is looking to staff up Palisades Estates to about 20 agents and they\u2019ve got about half that right now.\nShe\u2019s in talks with some local agents about making the move. Branden said they\u2019re coming from both boutiques and larger brokerages in the area.\nThe Beverly Hills Estates is already ramping its presence in the community, inking a deal to sponsor the annual Palisades Turkey Trot. That\u2019ll expose its brand to the over 2,000 people who signed up for the race on Thanksgiving Day.\nPalisades Estates is the first step in a broader strategy that will plant the Beverly Hills Estates in key high-end markets locally as it looks to grow, while maintaining its stature as a boutique brokerage.\n\u201cOur goal is to open five divisions throughout the city and remain a small boutique firm with the highest execution of customer service and luxury residential real estate,\u201d Branden said.\nThat could potentially include the Valley, Malibu, Montecito and the Eastside.\nNext month, the brokerage is set to launch the first episode of its podcast, which shares the same name as the company\u2019s tag line: \u201cEstate of Mind.\u201d\nThe podcast will feature the Williamses, along with Chernov and her daughter Zoe, with a focus on what Rayni described as \u201call things lifestyle.\u201d\nThe Beverly Hills Estates\nranked No. 11\non this year\u2019s list of the top brokerages in Los Angeles County, generating sales volume of $1.5 billion across 305 transactions, according to\nTRD Data\n. The production was between July 1, 2024 and July 1, 2025 and did not include off-market deals or those under $1 million.\n",

        "content": "Intrigue around the timing aside, it didn\u2019t mean much when Scott Wiener, the housing policy guru who represents San Francisco in California\u2019s state senate, entered the race for Congress\u2019s 11th district more than a month ago. Challenging Nancy Pelosi isn\u2019t necessarily a winning strategy. But then came some\npolitical calculus\nthat put Wiener\u2019s perch as one of the most transformative California legislators of his generation in a different light.\nOn Thursday, Pelosi announced she wouldn\u2019t seek reelection to a 21st term. A few days later, Christine Pelosi, who many believed to be the former speaker\u2019s heir apparent, announced she wasn\u2019t interested in her mother\u2019s seat.\nIn a post on X,\nthe younger Pelosi instead revealed a plan to seek San Francisco\u2019s state senate seat, currently held by Wiener.\nOnce you iron out the tangle of political fates, it\u2019s clear that, without a Pelosi in the race, Wiener has suddenly risen as the frontrunner for a seat he has long sought. He\u2019s already raised more than $1 million, far ahead of his most prominent challenger, Saikat Chakrabarti, the former chief of staff for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Now, real estate executives are musing on whether Wiener, if successful, can carry that housing momentum to Washington.\nHis platform indicates he at least plans to. Housing largely exists as a city hall and, more recently, a statehouse issue, but Wiener lists it as his top priority if elected to Congress.\nHis track record adds weight to such ambition\u2013since Wiener\u2019s election to the state senate in 2016, California has multiplied the housing production it requires from cities and counties. The same tenure saw the legislature strengthen the state\u2019s\nenforcement credentials\nand empower the attorney general\u2019s office to go after local jurisdictions that fall short of the housing mandates.\nWeiner authored a number of bills crucial to establishing leverage for the state, cutting into the local control over zoning held exclusively by cities and counties. His SB 79,\nsigned by Gov. Gavin Newsom last month\n, offered the most recent example: it automatically upzoned the land along major transit lines in eight of the state\u2019s most populous counties.\nDavid Garcia, policy director for Up For Growth, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit focused on housing legislation, emphasized Weiner would face a very different legislative landscape if he wins Pelosi\u2019s seat.\n\u201cThe policies that have been pursued in California wouldn\u2019t translate to Congress, and it\u2019s unlikely that Congress would support the feds pre-empting local zoning laws,\u201d Garcia told The Real Deal.\nIndeed, the federal government has historically dealt in the financing side of the equation. The creation of the 30-year mortgage, the distribution of low-income housing tax credits, and the Community Reinvestment Act, which pressed banks to provide capital for affordable housing projects, are all federal initiatives.\nWithin that financing realm, Garcia said a pro-housing legislator could push for new tax credits that facilitate specific construction types, such as missing middle housing and accessory dwelling units.\nYet, the simple creation of new financing tools will mean nothing if they\u2019re not made easier to use, said Jon White, chief real estate officer of Abode, the Bay Area\u2019s largest non-profit housing developer.\n\u201cAffordable housing projects will only turn to federal financing if the project depends on it, because it\u2019s so hard to deal with,\u201d White told The Real Deal. \u201cStreamling would be really helpful.\u201d\nFederal money often comes with a suite of what many developers and pro-housing advocates see as onerous and expensive requirements, including compliances with the National Environmental Protection Act, using American-made construction materials, and paying prevailing wages. Some of this is familiar territory for Wiener, who helped push through\nlandmark legislation to reform and streamline\nthe California Environmental Quality Act earlier this year, which had increasingly become a tool for opponents to slow or block housing developments.\nWhite, who called himself \u201ca fan\u201d of Wiener\u2019s work in the state legislature, said he wants to see Congress expand project-based vouchers \u2014 an important housing subsidy that White called the \u201clifeblood\u201d of deeply affordable and permanent supportive housing developments \u2014 and address skyrocketing insurance costs. He said insurance rates have increased as much as 300% for housing developers in recent years.\n\u201cA lot of projects at Abode are under water because of insurance cost increases, and it\u2019s going to take a national solution to figure out insurance,\u201d White said.\nYet, not everyone believes Wiener will have the same latitude to effect housing if he wins Pelosi\u2019s seat next year.\nThe CEO of one of California\u2019s largest for-profit developers sang Wiener\u2019s praises as \u201csmart, relentless, detail-oriented and willing to take risks,\u201d and referred to him as the \u201cthe most pro-housing legislator in California.\u201d But he believes Wiener\u2019s influence, if he reaches Congress, could become diluted by representing a Democratic stronghold and as one of 435 votes in the House of Representatives.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be transformational, you can make more of a difference in housing at the state level than the federal level, that\u2019s just a fact,\u201d said the CEO, who only agreed to speak on background out of concern for getting too involved in an active race. \u201cI\u2019d start by saying, \u2018Do no harm.\u2019 But frankly, I\u2019m not looking at Congress to be the major movers on housing policy.\u201d\nOn this point, Abode\u2019s chief real estate officer White sees an inverse reality. Although Wiener has been among the most effective legislators in California, the statehouse is now filled with lawmakers cut from a similar pro-housing cloth, and Weiner\u2019s legacy of hammering on housing appears to leave Sacramento in good stead.\n\u201cOn the federal side, there\u2019s not many people who understand affordable housing in Congress,\u201d White said. \u201cHis expertise could be way more valuable in Congress. We have a strong bench in the state, but the federal government needs more experience.\u201d\nA sea change could be shaping up in the U.S. Capitol, though.\u00a0 Over the last few years, a bipartisan, pro-housing YIMBY Caucus (Yes, In My Backyard) has formed, and just last month the Senate passed the ROAD to Housing Act, a 300-page bill led by otherwise strange political bedfellows Sens. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass). A key provision of the bill would tie the amount of federal money a city or county receives through the Community Development Block Grant program to the amount of housing it produces.\nThat adds up to a \u201csignificant shift\u201d for Congress that seemed like an impossibility even just a year ago, according to Up for Growth\u2019s Garcia.\n\u201cThere would have been a time that a new member would get to Congress and talk about housing and not be taken seriously, because it just wasn\u2019t on anyone\u2019s radar,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cNow, if Scott Wiener wins, he will find himself among many other members talking about housing supply. And I think he would come to Congress with the biggest track record for doing really big housing policy.\u201d\n\n",

        "content": "The federal government\u2019s reopening could close the door on the U.S. hemp boom \u2014 an $8 billion industry with deep roots and a massive retail real estate presence across Texas.\nLanguage tucked into the continuing appropriations and extensions act \u2014 Congress\u2019 vehicle to end the record-long government shutdown \u2014 would effectively ban nearly all\nhemp products\ncontaining tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, nationwide, Bisnow\nreported\n.\nThe measure wouldn\u2019t take effect for a year, but experts say that\u2019s little comfort for an industry already on notice. A ban could force the closure of thousands of businesses across the state, potentially leaving up to 17 million square feet of\nretail space\nvacant and delivering a shockwave through the commercial real estate sector.\n\u201cIt would have to be the passion project of a politician willing to die on that hill,\u201d said California cannabis attorney Brandon Dorsky, who\u2019s practiced in the field since 2009. \u201cAnd there\u2019s only one of those \u2014 Rand Paul.\u201d\nThe Kentucky senator introduced an amendment this week to strike the ban, warning it would \u201cregulate the hemp industry to death\u201d and erase years of consumer and farmer gains.\nThe amendment failed 76\u201324, with Paul and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz the lone Republicans voting yes. Cruz argued on X that regulation of hemp and marijuana products should remain a state issue, not a federal mandate.\nTexas\u2019 hemp sector exploded after the 2018 Farm Bill legalized hemp products with 0.3 percent or less THC. Today, the industry supports over 50,000 jobs and about\n8,500 businesses statewide\n. Licensed\nbrands\nrange from mom-and-pop CBD shops to grocery giant H-E-B.\nThe bill would slash allowable THC content to just 0.4 milligrams per package \u2014 a threshold Paul said would wipe out 100 percent of\nhemp-derived products\ncurrently on the market. The senator blamed \u201cbad actors\u201d for abusing the 2018 law by boosting THC levels, but said the proposed fix goes too far.\nThe move follows failed state-level efforts to ban intoxicating hemp products earlier this year, when Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick pushed legislation that Gov. Greg Abbott ultimately vetoed. The industry called that decision a\nlifeline\n.\nNow, hemp advocates nationwide \u2014 including the Texas Hemp Business Council \u2014 are mobilizing to fight what they call a reckless reversal. \u201cHemp is too vital to the American economy to be dismantled by rushed, politically driven legislation,\u201d the group said, vowing to pursue \u201cevery legal and legislative option\u201d to keep the industry alive.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The Cornerstone Group and Brookstone Partners propose a 354-unit multifamily tower in Miami\u2019s Little Havana neighborhood, amid an apartment building frenzy in South Florida.\nCornerstone and Brookstone, both based in Hollywood, want to develop an eight-story building with a 5,000-square-foot grocery store on a 2.4-acre site on the northwest corner of Northwest Eighth Avenue and West Flagler Street, according to an application attached to a Miami board\u2019s agenda. The assemblage is at 826, 834, 842, 852 and 860 Northwest First Street; 805, 815, 827, 835, 843, 853 and 861 West Flagler Street; and 26 Northwest Eighth Avenue.\nThe Miami Urban Development Review Board will vote on the proposal at its meeting on Wednesday, including on the developers\u2019 waiver requests. Cornerstone and Brookstone seek a 10 percent reduction of required parking spaces, a bigger spacing between residential entrances and other waivers from the city code.\nDesigned by Corwil Architects, the building will consist of 38 studios, 170 one-bedroom apartments and 146 two-bedroom apartments, according to the application. It also will have a 500-space garage and 26 on-street spaces.\nCornerstone and Brookstone are affiliated and share a Hollywood headquarters, according to their websites. Both are led by Jorge Lopez, Leon J. Wolfe and Mara Mades.\nThe firms bought the majority of the development site for\n$15 million\nin 2023, records show. They also paid $825,000 for the property at 26 Northwest Eighth Avenue, according to records.\nSellers New York-based Posner Group and Miami Beach builders Todd Michael Glaser and i3 Development, led by Alan I. Amdur, had planned a mixed-use project for the site. They scored a\n$26.5 million\nacquisition, pre-development and construction loan in 2021. They planned a three-story, 52,500-square-foot retail building and a two-level garage with 217 parking spaces for the first phase, and a 20-story multifamily building with retail for the second phase.\nAcross South Florida, developers continue to propose and build multifamily projects, despite a\nsupply overhang\nthat\u2019s led to slower lease-ups, increased concessions and a decline in rents. In September, the median asking rent in the tri-county region was $2,298, a 3 percent drop from the same month last year, according to Realtor.com.\nDevelopers with apartments under construction say\ndemand will catch up\n, and rent growth will resume by the time they complete their buildings next year and in 2027.\nIn downtown Miami, Great Neck, New York-based Namdar Group is expected to complete a\n43-story, 680-unit\napartment tower at 55 Northeast Second Street early next year, and started construction in September of an adjacent\u00a0 43-story, 714-unit tower at 50 Northeast Third Street.\nKeystone Development + Investment is working on an office-to-residential conversion near Dadeland Mall, creating\n212 apartments\n, combined, at the office buildings at 9400 South Dadeland Boulevard and 9500 South Dadeland Boulevard in unincorporated Miami-Dade County.\n",

Pei-designed building \u2014 pegged between $152 million and $345 million \u2014 against relocating city operations elsewhere.

Meanwhile, the city\u2019s Landmark Commission has already begun proceedings to give City Hall historic designation, temporarily shielding it from demolition.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

One of them, Bolton St. John\u2019s partner Teresa Gonzalez, donated $250 in 2022 while lobbying Hudson on a mixed-use project from Hudson Companies, then another $250 in 2024 tied to a separate proposal the councilmember ultimately opposed.\nHudson also took a matchable $250 donation from Simba Property Group CEO Jordan Sakni in March, after deleting the pledge. A smaller 2023 contribution from a Madison International Realty analyst turned into $1,575 under the city\u2019s public matching program.\nThe contradictions could complicate Hudson\u2019s bid to lead the Council, where the speaker wields heavy influence over rezonings and development priorities citywide. Hudson, who represents Crown Heights, Prospect Heights and Clinton Hill, is running as the progressive alternative to Manhattan Councilmember Julie Menin, a more centrist Democrat.\nThe controversy lands weeks before members vote internally on a speaker to replace Adrienne Adams, whose term is set to expire on Dec. 31. Hudson\u2019s alignment with Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani \u2014 a Democratic socialist who publicly pledged to not accept donations from the real estate industry \u2014 could prove a boost or a liability.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Brooklyn real estate investor Sanford Solny is headed to prison for a\nyears-long deed theft\nscheme that stripped homeowners \u2014 many of them immigrants and people of color \u2014 of their properties.\nSolny, 68, was sentenced Wednesday to up to seven years behind bars after being convicted in June on 17 counts, including grand larceny, scheme to defraud and criminal possession of stolen property, the New York Times\nreported\n. The ruling caps a case that became a flashpoint for New York\u2019s growing fight against deed theft, a form of property fraud.\nBrooklyn Supreme Court Justice Danny Chun ordered that 11 stolen deeds be nullified, potentially allowing victims to reclaim homes. But Chun stopped short of granting restitution, meaning Solny won\u2019t have to return the roughly $500,000 in rent he collected after evicting owners and installing tenants.\nSolny, a disbarred attorney from Midwood, pitched struggling homeowners on \u201cshort sales,\u201d promising to negotiate with banks to wipe away debt. Instead, prosecutors said, he transferred the deeds to himself or shell companies while leaving mortgages and tax obligations in the original owners\u2019 names. Victims testified that the scams left them homeless, financially ruined and fighting for more than a decade to undo fraudulent transfers.\nOutside the courtroom, there was a standoff between Solny\u2019s supporters and supporters of the victims. Inside the courtroom, victims described the long toll of the fraud.\n\u201cBecause of Sanford Solny, I lost my home. I lost all my furniture and I lost all the work that I put into my home,\u201d Janet Bruce, who emigrated from Guyana and bought her Flatbush home in 2006 before losing it in 2014, wrote in a statement to the court.\nThe sentencing followed a prior conviction in Queens in 2018 for similar crimes, when Solny received five years\u2019 probation. Last month, Solny was\nremanded\nto custody during a hearing in Queens after allegedly violating his probation. The move seemingly came as a surprise to Solny, as it was on the eve of Yom Kippur and he didn\u2019t have his medicine on him.\nProsecutors noted that at least one of his Brooklyn thefts occurred after that earlier sentence, a sign he kept the grift going even while under court supervision.\nDeed theft is challenging to prosecute, as intent needs to be shown and victims typically sign legally-binding documents, allowing perpetrators to frame schemes as legal business deals.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The buyer, an affiliate of Los Angeles-based\nJRK Property Holdings\n, led by Jay Lippman, paid $41.6 million below the previous sale price four years ago.\nBerkadia\u2019s Jaret Turkell and Omar Morales brokered the deal. JRK paid roughly $245,424 per apartment.\nAs part of the deal, JRK assumed an existing $57.8 million commercial securities mortgage backed loan originated by Berkadia, according to Vizzda.\nLerner Residential and JRK representatives did not respond to requests for comment.\nLerner Residential, the multifamily arm of Lerner Enterprises, led by Mark Lerner, bought Motion at Dadeland in 2021 for\n$114 million\n, assuming an $89.5 million loan at the time, records show. The Lerner family bought the Washington Nationals in 2006 for $450 million.\nLerner\u2019s sale to JRK marks a significant price drop, underscoring ongoing revaluations in\nsouth Florida\u2019s multifamily market\namid an oversupply of apartments, a slowdown in rent growth, high interest rates and constraints on equity capital.\nIn Palm Beach Gardens, Boston-based West Shore this month bought a 542-unit apartment complex for\n$117.9 million\n. The seller, Aventura-based Advenir, paid $97.3 million for the property in 2018, but also took out an $80 million loan the same year to renovate the 34 two-story rental buildings, a storage building and a clubhouse.\nCompleted in 2019 on a 0.8-acre site, Motion at Dadeland spans roughly 514,600 square feet. The tower offers studios, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments. Motion at Dadeland also has 8,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space. Asking rents range from $1,955 to $4,310 a month, according to Apartments.com\nMiami-based Adler Group, 13th Floor Investments, and Barings developed Motion at Dadeland with a\n$50 million\nconstruction loan.

        "content": "Southern California developers are increasingly striking deals on land once used for oil extraction.\nOil drilling sites across Los Angeles are being reclaimed for commercial real estate development as the City and County of Los Angeles move to phase out drilling, Commercial Observer\nreported\n. As it stands, there are 68 named oil fields and thousands of wells across the city.\nThose parcels are becoming redevelopment targets as buildable land is scarce and prices are climbing, making former\noil and refinery sites\nattractive in both scale and price. It\u2019s not necessarily easier, however, given the environmental, financial and bureaucratic headaches that can drag projects for years.\n\u201cThey all come with different constraints of different types and different challenges. We like to say, \u2018There\u2019s some hair on this deal.\u2019 Sometimes the hair is of a cleanup nature. There\u2019s something that needs to be cleaned up before it can be properly reused,\u201d Preston Brooks, a real estate attorney dealing with contaminated properties for real estate law firm Cox, Castle &amp; Nicholson, told Commercial Observer. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s going to be these wells. But there\u2019s such a strong appetite for acquiring properties that are otherwise good real estate.\u201d\nInvestors from nonprofits to national REITs are lining up.\nThe Los Angeles Neighborhood Land Trust, for example, is converting a 2-acre site in South L.A. site with 36 decommissioned wells into a park, community center and affordable housing. It purchased the property from Sentinel Peak Resources in 2023 for about $10 million.\n\u201cThis project actually came to us from the community,\u201d executive director Tori Kjer said. \u201cThere was just this coexistence of two land uses that don\u2019t work well together.\u201d\nIn Huntington Beach,\nShopoff Realty\nis pushing a 29-acre\nredevelopment of a site\nformerly known as Magnolia Tank Farm into about 200 single-family homes, a 50-unit affordable multifamily complex, a 215-room hotel and about 19,000 square feet of retail space. Shopoff had purchased the coastal site in 2016; by that time, most of the tank infrastructure on site had been demolished. The firm has already gotten entitlements and approvals from the California Coastal Commission and the Huntington Beach City Council.\nThe biggest swing may be\nPhillips 66\n\u2019s plan to turn its 440-acre Wilmington refinery into Five Points Union, a mixed-use district with 270,000 square feet of retail, 67,500 square feet of restaurant space, a 60,000-square-foot indoor sports facility, two outdoor soccer fields, green space, parking for nearly 2,500 vehicles and eight industrial facilities totaling about 6.1 million square feet. Cleanup alone could top $231 million and take years, with oversight from at least five state and local agencies.\nEven when sites are remediated, developers can\u2019t always count on smooth sailing. Old wells can leak or sit undocumented, creating costly surprises mid-construction, such as like Aragon Properties\u2019 2018 spill in Echo Park or an oil geyser that delayed a Marina del Rey hotel project by a Hardage Hospitality affiliate.\nStill, with housing needs surging and undeveloped land in the region hard to come by, developers are betting that California\u2019s dirtiest dirt could prove to be its most valuable. The City of Los Angeles alone must plan for 456,643 new units of housing by 2029 as part of its\nhousing element\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

The project will also feature underground parking, and Highwood Mayor Charlie Pecaro called it a key step in \u201celevating the residential and dining experience\u201d in the suburb\u2019s core.\nThe project comes as suburban multifamily rents climb. Median net rent across the Chicago suburbs rose 4.1 percent year over year in the second quarter to $2.18 per square foot, according to Integra Realty Resources. Median rent in the North Shore hit $3.04 per square foot, with roughly 750 units under construction as of midyear.\nFor Moyer, the deal extends a run of activity in the luxury rental space. The firm also closed a $29 million loan from Principal Financial last year to build an 84-unit apartment project at 537 West Drummond Place in\nLincoln Park\n, slated to open in spring. That mid-rise will include coworking space, a fitness center, rooftop deck and fire pits \u2014 along with two affordable units, even though the project\u2019s approval predates the city\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance.\nHighwood\u2019s latest project marks a notable evolution for the small North Shore community, where multifamily construction has historically been rare.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The loan is tied to five properties in Denton built between 1962 and 1975. They\u2019re off-campus student housing options for students at the University of North Texas.\nIt\u2019s possible that Jordan Multifamily and Argentic will come to a deal before the auction, which could cancel the sale. If they don\u2019t, the properties will be sold at an auction on Dec. 2 at 10 a.m. at the Denton County Courthouse.\nThe firm could lose a 79-unit complex at 911 Bernard Street; an 80-unit complex at 707 Bernard Street; an 81-unit complex at 1607 West Live Oak Street; an 82-unit complex at 1003 Eagle Drive; and an 83-unit complex at 2424 West Oak Street.\nThe portfolio comprises 405 units; the loan works out to $137,037 per unit. Jordan purchased the properties in 2022.\nThe firm specializes in fixing up older apartment complexes, raising rents and selling them for a profit. The value-add strategy has gone bust for many operators during this economic cycle. They bought older properties when interest rates were low and property values were high. When interest rates skyrocketed, debt service on floating-rate loans ballooned, and construction costs also increased.\nAt the same time, major Texas metros saw a historic flood of apartment developments come online, which put downward pressure on rental rates and occupancy levels.\nAs a result, value-add multifamily operators have faced a lot of distress, making up\nmost of the commercial debt\nheaded to foreclosure each month.\nExperts say there\u2019s more around the corner. In the next five years,\n$19 billion in CMBS loans\ntied to Texas multifamily will mature, CWCapital\u2019s James Shevlin said at a recent Texas multifamily conference hosted by Connect CRE.\n",

        "content": "While the sweeping rezoning in Long Island City grabbed the spotlight at yesterday\u2019s City Council meeting, an\nElmhurst development\nscored a quieter win of its own.\nThe council on Wednesday approved the rezoning from manufacturing to residential of 78-01 Queens Boulevard, where\nAndrew Esposito\n\u2019s Apex Development Group plans to replace a bank and parking lot with a 314-unit mixed-use development.\nThe plan drew heavy criticism at the community board level, where more than 30 members voted against it. The proposal ultimately passed after negotiations with council member Shekar Krishnan, who pushed for deeper affordability and community amenities.\n\u201cDoing nothing in a housing crisis is not an option,\u201d Krishnan said before yesterday\u2019s vote, citing skyrocketing rents and stagnant wages for residents in his district.\n\u201cThe deal we are voting on today demonstrates that development can be done differently, anchored in affordability, community partnership and accountability,\u201d Krishnan said.\nThe final agreement sets aside 25 percent of units for households making an average of 55 percent of the area median income, a step deeper than the standard 60 percent required under the city\u2019s Mandatory Inclusionary Housing law.\nTwo additional features helped secure Krishnan\u2019s support \u2014 a community center with a swimming pool and a small public park. The pool will be operated by the nonprofit Commonpoint Queens. The project will also dedicate 5,000 square feet of land as open park space with benches, accessible to the public.\nApex\u2019s partner Sunlight Development bought the lot in 2023 for $9.5 million. Apex plans to spend about $195 million to develop the property using the\n485x tax abatement program\n. The original rezoning application extended beyond Sunlight\u2019s property and sought to rezone three neighboring parcels but those properties were ultimately excluded from the rezoning.\nEsposito said the process reflected a model for how rezonings should unfold \u2014 with negotiation but also an eye toward feasibility.\n\u201cIf you agree to the wrong things, it could really hurt the financeability of ever building a project,\u201d he said. \u201cThis one, we\u2019ll actually be able to deliver.\u201d\n",

        "content": "An all-affordable senior housing complex in Beverly Hills is a step closer to becoming reality.\nThe City of Beverly Hills voted Wednesday to enter into a one-year exclusive negotiation agreement with nonprofit developer West Hollywood Community Housing Corporation regarding a ground lease at 327-335 South Robertson Boulevard.\n\u201cOur hope is to execute a long-term ground lease of 55 years or longer,\u201d Anup Nitin Patel,\ndirector of real estate development for West Hollywood Community Housing Corporation, told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nPlans call for 50 units \u2014 the minimum the developer said it needs for the project to pencil out \u2014 across four to five stories with an additional rooftop amenity level, according to a presentation by Logan Phillippo, real property development manager for the city. The preliminarily proposed development has 49 one-bedroom affordable units age-restricted for those 55 years and older and one on-site manager\u2019s unit, according to\nthe city staff report\n.\nThe project, slated for the west side of Robertson Boulevard between Wilshire and Olympic boulevards, would include retail and private parking.\nBeverly Hills City Parking Authority, a city agency providing and managing public parking facilities, acquired the 13,740-square-foot site for $10.1 million in 2019. The Parking Authority will transfer the site to the city via a quitclaim deed.\nWednesday\u2019s vote allows West Hollywood Community Housing Corporation to demonstrate site control, a requirement for the organization to pursue $3 million in funding from a LA County Affordable Housing Solutions Agency grant. The application for LACAHSA\u2019s Draft Notice of Funding Availability deadline is Dec. 22, Phillippo said.\nWith 50 units, the city estimates the development costs would total $42 million. The site could accommodate up to 80 units. The developer will seek additional public financing to foot the bill.\nThe property is home to a single-story, 6,000-square-foot commercial structure with eight retail spaces of approximately 750 square feet each, according to the staff report. Five of the eight spaces are vacant. The remaining spaces are occupied on a month-to-month basis, with a total rent roll of $9,090 per month.\nEstablished in 1986, West Hollywood Community Housing Corporation develops, owns and operates affordable housing projects in West Hollywood and the greater Los Angeles area. Completed projects include the 42-unit Mariposa Lily, an affordable and permanent supportive housing development in the Pico Union district just west of downtown Los Angeles, and the 93-unit Westmore Linden affordable rental housing for seniors in the neighboring Westlake district.\nThe city has committed to facilitating the development of 557 units of affordable housing on multiple city properties, as described in the housing element of the city\u2019s general plan.\nBeverly Hills Mayor Sharona Nazarian said the site \u201cmakes sense for housing,\u201d rather than its original intention for parking.\nShe noted that several sites originally designated for affordable housing in the city have since been identified as \u201csitting on an active fault line,\u201d so housing cannot be built on them. \u201cAs a result we must look for sites to fulfill our housing obligation,\u201d she added.\nNazarian warned that without proactive action, the city could lose control over its own development, opening the door for large-scale\nbuilder\u2019s remedy projects\nto reshape Beverly Hills.\nBuilder\u2019s remedy is a loophole in state housing law that lets developers skirt zoning rules in cities that fail to certify their state housing plans, as long as they include at least 20 percent affordable housing.\n",

        "pub_date_dt": "2025-11-14T12:30:00",
        "content": "Before 485x, projects with exactly 99 units were rare \u2014 only 13 were filed in 15 years. Last quarter alone, developers filed 21.\nMeanwhile, just 12 of 207 multifamily projects filed were for 100 or more units.\nThese statistics, flagged by a Real Estate Board of New York report Wednesday, might seem like nothing to worry about, given that the unit count in new filings\nsurged to 11,746\n.\nThe problem is that all of these 99-unit sites are zoned for more than 99. In a housing shortage, the last thing the city wants is to leave units on the table or induce developers to inefficiently split projects into several buildings, each under 100 units.\nBut the construction workers\u2019 wage floor that kicks in for 485x projects with 100 or more units is too scary for developers, investors and lenders.\nThe funny thing is, the wages required on 100- to 149-unit projects receiving the state\u2019s 485x tax break (which is essential for mixed-income rental projects) aren\u2019t much different from what developers pay for 99-unit projects. Why not just pay a bit more?\nThe reason: Developers (and their lenders) don\u2019t want to risk falling short of the wage floor \u2014 which can happen even if they are trying to meet it. The penalties are severe. Better to stick to 99 units and not have to worry about compliance costs.\nProjects of 100 or more units are most likely to happen in high-rent areas such as Soho. \u201cThe numbers work,\u201d a developer told me Thursday at a Brooklyn real estate breakfast.\nOne panelist at the event, developer\nSergey Rybak\n, told the audience that the wage floor does drive up costs, but \u201cthe cost of 485x is not such a drastic difference.\u201d He noted that higher wages can mean getting a contractor who works 20 percent faster, offsetting the extra labor expense.\nTrue, but what matters is what is actually happening. And what\u2019s happening are 99-unit projects, and virtually none of 150 or more, where an even higher wage floor kicks in. (This does not apply to fully affordable housing.)\nEvery developer I have asked believes 485x needs to be changed. But I have not found any who think it will be changed in 2026, which is an election year for Gov. Kathy Hochul and state legislators.\nThe reason: The average voter does not care about 485x, but construction unions do.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nThis seems odd. The Wall Street Journal reported Nov. 7 that Blackstone is selling off a $1.8 billion\nsenior housing portfolio\nof about 90 properties, some at more than 70 percent below their purchase price. Five days later, Baker Tilly\u2019s third-quarter commercial real estate report declared, \u201cThe senior housing sector is experiencing a\nstrong rebound\nin 2025, after a period of recovery brought on by significant operational challenges during and after the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d Send thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Construction spending nationwide was down 4.7 percent (adjusted for inflation) in the past 12 months, according to a\nJLL report\n. The decline came despite increases in spending on data centers, utilities, infrastructure and especially office-to-residential conversions, which doubled. JLL blamed uncertainty caused by \u201cpolicy volatility,\u201d namely unpredictable trade policy (aka tariff chaos) and immigration enforcement.\nElsewhere\u2026\nAs yesterday\u2019s Daily Dirt reported, because of a pending legal challenge, New York will postpone the January start of its law that essentially requires all-electric buildings for projects of seven or fewer stories. The mandate kicks in for larger buildings in 2029.\nBut developers of New York City projects are already making them all-electric. Technology is making electric heat increasingly efficient, and contractors can now make buildings nearly airtight.\nWhile opponents of the bill are framing it as an affordability issue, as is Gov. Kathy Hochul, it seems likely that new buildings will be cheaper to heat and not necessarily more expensive to build.\nThe real issue is how to make existing buildings compliant with the city\u2019s Local Law 97. Richard Lipsky, who is organizing opposition to the law, says Co-op City told him its compliance cost would be more than $2 billion.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$23.5 million\nfor a 3,556-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at 50 West 66th Street in Lincoln Square. Janice Chang and Timothy Hsu with Douglas Elliman had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$85 million\nfor the 136,730-square-foot apartment building at 181 Front Street in Dumbo. The Carlyle Group sold the 105-unit property to an LLC tied to HUBB NYC Properties.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$7.85 million\nfor a 1,941-square-foot condominium unit at 40 Bleecker Street in Noho. Danielle Nazinitsky with Decode Real Estate has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 807,803-square-foot, 792-unit, 38-story project at 45 West Street in Greenpoint. Robert Laudenschlager with SLCE Architects filed the permit on behalf of TF Cornerstone.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

The move followed years of litigation with the owners of the hotel at 1 North Fort Lauderdale Beach Boulevard, affiliates of New York-based\nBrookfield Properties\nand Chicago-based\nWatermark Capital Partners\n.\nThe bankruptcy filing blocks the Brookfield affiliate from collecting on $7.9 million in financial damages awarded by a Broward County Circuit judge in May.\nThe\nRitz-Carlton, Fort Lauderdale\nincludes a 166-key hotel, 34 condo-hotel units and 28 condo units. In 2019, CGHCRA filed suit against Brookfield and Watermark in Broward County Circuit Court, alleging the condo-hotel unit owners were paying an unfair share of the property\u2019s expenses. The hotel owners responded with a counter claim, and in 2022, the court ruled in their favor, the South Florida Business Journal reported.\nIn May of this year,\nBroward County\nJudge Michael W. Robinson ruled that CGHCRA owed the Brookfield affiliate, CWI-CG RCFL Property Owner LLC, $7.9 million in financial damages, based on a special assessment for attorneys fees and other legal expenses related to the suit.\n\u201cAfter presiding over this case from its inception, the court is uniquely familiar with the lack of any merit to plaintiff\u2019s legal contentions,\u201d Judge Robinson wrote in the final ruling, adding that the condo association dragged out the suit and demanded unnecessary discovery.\nThe outstanding $7.9 million claim is the most expensive liability listed in the association\u2019s Chapter 11 filing, followed by a $1.5 million claim from Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, which is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, according to the publication.\n\u2013\u2013\nKate Hinsche",

        "content": "Jovanka Novakovic isn\u2019t flinching.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t changed the way I market because of Zillow\u2019s restrictions,\u201d the Chicago-based Compass agent said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a listing where I did anything differently.\u201d\nNovakovic is one of the brokers whose strategy is under fire from Zillow. The issue is over listings on the Chicago MLS-backed Private Listing Network, as Zillow has taken aim at platforms sharing home offerings with brokers that keep them off public websites like its own.\nNovakovic said she uses Compass\u2019 three-phased marketing strategy on all her listings, starting them out as Compass Private Exclusives before going to the Private Listing Network and then to the traditional public MLS. Clients agree to it after she gives them an overview of the process, and she said it gives sellers the opportunity to research the market value of their homes. Around 75 percent of her listings end up on the public market after going through the earlier phases, she said.\nHer experience is part of a broader clash playing out between Zillow and the Chicago-area\u2019s Multiple Listing Service operator known as\nMidwest Real Estate Data (MRED)\nover its Private Listing Network (PLN). The PLN shows brokers subscribed to MRED its listings but keeps them out of view on portals available to the general public.\nZillow\u2019s effort to limit methods like Compass Private Exclusives has also affected how it treats PLN offerings, which it considers to be in violation of its recently updated Listing Access Standards. Although Zillow has been warning Chicago managing brokers that listings hitting the PLN before going public violate the company\u2019s rules, it hasn\u2019t begun enforcing them in the Chicago market and still displays them on its website once they\u2019re publicly for sale.\nOn the other hand, MRED insists the PLN has a place in the housing market and is doubling down on supporting the tactic. In the dispute\u2019s latest step, MRED\u2019s CEO Rebecca Jensen gave a spirited defense of the PLN in a message to her members this week.\nJensen laid out circumstances when a seller might want to use the PLN, including in sensitive situations following divorce or death. The letter didn\u2019t mention Zillow by name, but Jensen made an apparent jab at\nZillow\u2019s new Listing Access Standards\n, saying the PLN is an alternative to \u201ca one-size-fits-all model that restricts options for sellers and their brokers and is devoid of compassion and understanding.\u201d\nThe Private Listing Network, launched in 2016, is an MRED service that lets agents make listings that are visible to all brokers with access to the MLS, but are kept off public websites like Zillow.\nZillow\u2019s recent emphasis on its Listing Access Standards, similar to the National Association of Realtors\u2019\nClear Cooperation Policy\n, requires that a home offering be made available on Zillow within one business day of public marketing. However, Clear Cooperation Policy differs by allowing MLS-wide private listing services like MRED\u2019s.\nBut with Zillow\u2019s policy, marketing a property on a private network then moving it to the public MLS isn\u2019t allowed. Compass has\nsued Zillow\nover the rules, arguing they violate antitrust laws.\nZillow has said private listing networks distort the marketplace, hurt consumers and threaten fair housing standards by concealing some listings from the public. \u201cHidden listing schemes disadvantage sellers and buyers, and that\u2019s what this is,\u201d Zillow said in a previous statement to\nTRD\n.\nJensen\u2019s message brought attention to what she called the \u201cFive Ds\u201d that could prompt a seller to list privately: divorce, death, disability, displacement and downsizing. She framed the PLN as an option rooted in \u201chuman empathy\u201d to prevent broadcasting sellers who want privacy.\n\u201cRigid rules or public exposure that the seller can\u2019t control heightens an already stressful time,\u201d Jensen\u2019s lengthy email said. \u201cWhen we created the PLN, our goal was to honor those experiences while maintaining the transparency and data consistency that make the MLS valuable.\u201d\nMatt Laricy, head of Americorp, one of Chicago\u2019s top brokerages by sales volume, said he received a call from Zillow warning that listings that hit the PLN may not appear on Zillow. Laricy said he\u2019s generally opposed to private listings, but he sometimes moves listings into the PLN during the holiday season when buyer activity slows down, before making them public again.\nLaricy claimed Zillow representatives said they may make exceptions in some cases for circumstances like that, but he hadn\u2019t received confirmation.\n\u201cRight now, the MLS is getting pulled in the middle of this power play between two behemoths of companies,\u201d Laricy said. \u201cThey can\u2019t really afford to be in bad graces with Zillow and they can\u2019t afford to be in bad graces with Compass, so they\u2019re trying to just walk the line and be relevant.\u201d\nMRED hasn\u2019t stated how it will respond if Zillow begins enforcing its company rules, and a spokesperson for the MLS didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. MRED has said its license agreement with Zillow requires Zillow to display all public listings without restriction. But the MLS also hinted it\u2019s not a fan of private exclusives \u2014 a step of seclusion beyond the PLN \u2014 by claiming it will work to give all its registered brokers a look at the full slate of the region\u2019s real estate offerings.\n\u201cMRED\u2019s dedicated to ensuring that all our brokerages and brokers have access to all listings within your market and will equally enforce our rules around displaying MLS data,\u201d Jensen said in the Nov. 12 email.\nEditor\u2019s note: This story has been updated to clarify Zillow\u2019s communications with Novakovic.\n",

        "content": "A fine jeweler is moving its flagship location from a downtown Winnetka storefront to Brookfield Properties\u2019\nOakbrook Center\n, as the mall and the suburb itself are gaining a reputation for courting affluent shoppers and residents.\nLANA Jewelry has a presence across the country at Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom, Bergdorf Goodman and will soon launch at Bloomingdale\u2019s. Operating out of these department stores helped founder Lana Bramlette gain insight into the performance of various malls.\n\u201cWe have all this great data to know which malls and areas are the best performing for us,\u201d she said.\nLANA will join the ranks of other high-end brands including jeweler David Yurman in the luxury section of west suburban Oakbrook Center, a longtime goal of the locally based brand.\n\u201cIt was a dream to be amongst those neighbors; next to a David Yurman and a Gucci and across from a Louis Vuitton,\u201d Bramlette said. \u201cIt was time, in essence, for us to take it to the next level. We\u2019ve been working on this deal for almost a year.\u201d\nWhile Chicago\u2019s North Shore suburbs, including Winnetka, have long been home to the region\u2019s most affluent residents, Oak Brook has been luring those residents and businesses, as well.\nLast month, an Oak Brook mansion sold for $5.3 million, the highest price achieved for a home sale in the suburb in 16 years.\nLANA is not alone in eyeing Oakbrook Center as a top performing mall. Last year, Google chose the mall for\nits first Midwest retail storefront\n.\nThe 3,500-square-foot store was the Silicon Valley giant\u2019s fifth brick-and-mortar location in the U.S. after it opened stores in New York City, California and Boston\nAnd this month, Kim Kardashian\u2019s shapewear brand\nSkims\nopened its second Chicago-area location in Oakbrook. The store\u2019s first Chicago store is in the Gold Coast\u2019s high-end shopping district along\nOak and Rush streets\n.\nThe influx of tenants is the culmination of a nearly-decade long revamp led by Brookfield.\nBrookfield acquired the mall in 2018 as part of a $15 billion buyout of GGP and then led a $177 million renovation of the property.\nThe real estate investing giant took out\na $475 million loan\non the property in 2020 and then secured a $700 million refinancing in 2023. The refinancing was the second largest-shopping mall deal in the country that year. After closing costs, Brookfield raked in $220 million in equity out of the property.\nPrior to the overhaul, the mall had been losing tenants, including Lord &amp; Taylor and Sears.\nAs a part of the $177 million renovation, Brookfield reworked former department store spaces into smaller storefronts that were later filled by tenants including,\u00a0 L.L. Bean, Life Time Fitness, RH Gallery and Sony Wonderverse.\nThe mall\u2019s performance improved steadily as a result, with sales topping $1 billion in 2023, according to Fitch Ratings.\nMomentum at the Oakbrook Center bucks the trend of suburban shopping malls spiraling into financial distress amid the rise of online shopping. In the Chicago area alone, there are at least five ongoing projects to\nrepurpose former suburban shopping malls\ninto multifamily housing and mixed-use districts.",

The asking price equates to $295 per square foot.\nSet on 14.4 acres, the Mt. Vernon-style residence has been in a kind of stately stasis the entire time.\nThe house has been \u201cvery well tended to\u201d under its absentee owners, requiring no repairs but leaving ample budget room for a buyer to remake the interiors, listing agent Gregg Bernadette of HomeSmart Connect told the outlet.\n\u201cAt $6.5 million, you might walk in and drop another million to make it look the way you want,\u201d Bernadette said.\nThe property has paved a long path of price reductions since its first $17 million listing. It most recently fell off the market in September at $6.5 million before reemerging at the same number on Nov. 12. Built atop a rise overlooking a private lake, the home includes seven bedrooms, a dramatic sweeping staircase, ornate fireplaces, a theater and a pool.\nThe seller is the Forsythe Building Fund, tied to power-equipment executive and investor Gerald Forsythe, CEO and chairman of Indeck, whose ventures stretch from industrial plants to pro racing to luxury golf.\nThe fund bought the unfinished structure in 2003 for $1.85 million and poured at least $10 million into completing and upgrading it, Bernadette said. Forsythe has never lived there; the asset was purely an investment play, he confirmed through previous brokers.\nForsythe is also linked to another\nBarrington\nmega-mansion roughly three miles away \u2014 also 22,000 square feet \u2014 that recently went under contract at $6.5 million after once asking $10.5 million.\nCarrying costs on the Old Sutton property have added up: Last year\u2019s tax bill exceeded $94,000, and upkeep for nearly two decades of vacancy stretches far higher. Crews from Forsythe\u2019s commercial holdings routinely maintain the lawn, winterize the home and keep the structure secure.\nThe\nBarrington luxury market\nis thin at this altitude. Only one property north of $6 million sold there this decade: The Barrington Hills mansion featured on\nEmpire\n, which traded in April for $9.4 million after 12 years on the market.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Local brokers can see listings on this private network, but they don\u2019t appear on public websites.\nZillow has stated that properties marketed privately are barred from its website, but the company might not be rigorously enforcing this rule in San Antonio.\nTexas doesn\u2019t require sale price disclosure, so sellers in areas with high property taxes\noften prefer private deals\nas a way to hide the true value of the home from local appraisers.\nZillow\u2019s listing standard\n, implemented earlier this year, only allows properties that have been entered in the MLS within a day of public marketing. The company\u2019s stated goal is to make every listing visible to all buyers, mirroring NAR\u2019s\nClear Cooperation Policy\n.\nZillow warned Chicago\u2019s MLS that its private network breaches this standard. However, Zillow declined to enforce its policy in Chicago, so properties formerly listed on MRED\u2019s Private Listing Network can still appear on Zillow.\nSan Antonio may be enjoying some immunity as well.\nWhen asked if Zillow is enforcing its private listing ban in San Antonio, Zillow spokesperson Hadley Stecker said that the company\u2019s standards \u201chave been live in San Antonio since the summer.\u201d\nSome agents haven\u2019t noticed, including Grant Lopez, president of Keller Williams Heritage, one of the largest brokerages in San Antonio.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard of any enforcement,\u201d said Lopez, who added that he marketed his own home privately earlier this year before selling it.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I would say they\u2019re not enforcing it, other than \u2014 from the get-go, I thought it was going to be hard for them to track it. I was wondering, how the hell are they going to track if something\u2019s off market and then later goes on market and is in Zillow?\u201d\nZillow is \u201ctracking listing violations in a variety of ways, ranging from programmatic methods to manual listing monitoring,\u201d communications director Hadley Stecker said.\nThe San Antonio Board of Realtors is working with Zillow to nail down its stance toward the private listing database, spokesperson Taylor Fellows said.\n\u201cWe were notified of a couple of violations from some of our agents, so we\u2019re in the process of working with Zillow to get some clarity because of what the rules look like,\u201d Fellows said.\nFellows said he doesn\u2019t know whether Zillow is temporarily allowing privately marketed listings.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Fellows said. \u201cI don\u2019t have the exact details on the violation and what all it did entail, but that\u2019s why we\u2019ve reached out to Zillow, and we\u2019re trying to clarify and resolve so we better understand.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The developers of Houston\u2019s first Ritz-Carlton locked in a sales team charged with bringing one of the city\u2019s priciest residential offerings to market.\nDeiso Moss\nand Cleary Interests tapped Karla Dupre, alongside\nRedeavor Group\n, as the exclusive sales representatives for The Ritz-Carlton Residences Houston, according to the developers, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n.\nDupre, co-founder of San Antonio-based Derive Development Group \u2014 which is not involved in this project \u2014 brings more than two decades of luxury high-rise experience across major Texas markets and abroad. Her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes marquee towers such as\nDC Partners\u2019 Allen Residences\nin Houston, The Arts Residences in San Antonio, The W Austin and The Omni in Fort Worth.\nRedeavor will handle broader sales and marketing efforts on behalf of Deiso Moss and\nMarriott\u2019s\nRitz-Carlton brand.\nDeiso Moss announced its partnership with Marriott on Sept. 10, confirming Ritz-Carlton\u2019s return to Houston after a 27-year absence. The building, rising at 2120 Post Oak Boulevard in the Galleria district, promises \u201ctimeless architecture\u201d and a level of hospitality the developers say Houston hasn\u2019t seen before.\nDesigned by Pickard Chilton with Ziegler Cooper as architect of record, the 44-story tower is expected to climb more than 600 feet, with interiors by Houston-based Rottet Studio. The program pairs 156 hotel rooms and 114 residences.\nThe project revived a delayed proposal from Deiso Moss for a 43-story mixed-use tower on the same site. Deiso Moss secured a bridge loan from Northwind Group for $26.1 million in 2022 before the project stalled out.\nThe smallest units will span 2,200 square feet with views spanning the Galleria and Uptown.\nResident-only amenities include a private motor court, lobby and elevator bank, along with optional private garages. Owners will also have access to another 50,000 square feet of hotel\namenities\nvia resident-only entry points.\nThe project marks Ritz-Carlton\u2019s sole Houston presence and just its third Texas location. The brand last operated in the city at River Oaks until the late 1990s, when several U.S. properties lost the flag.\nThe Post Oak development enters a Texas market where Ritz-Carlton is expanding on multiple fronts.\nIn The Woodlands,\nHoward Hughes\nis developing a standalone Ritz-Carlton-branded condo project \u2014 now topped out \u2014 offering roughly 40 floor plans across two 15-story towers connected by extensive amenity space.\nThat property includes lounges, private dining, a wine cellar, sports simulator room, lakefront fitness center and more than 1,200 feet of shoreline reserved for owners.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

A hearing to confirm the auction results is scheduled for early January. The site\u2019s owner \u2014 two entities managed by Brazilian developer Gilberto Bomeny \u2014 filed for Chapter 11 protection earlier this year to stave off a UCC foreclosure.\nWhile a minimum price has not been set, bidders will have to top a $101.5 million credit bid from Cirrus Real Estate Funding, the largest creditor in the bankruptcy case that alleges Bomeny\u2019s entities defaulted on a $70 million loan, court filings show.\nConcierge Auctions will conduct the sale and receive a 5 percent buyer\u2019s premium to be split with the broker, or a $750,000 flat fee if Cirrus wins the property with its credit bid.\nGabriel Flores with ONE Commercial is marketing the site, which hit the market in April for\n$175 million\n.\nIn 2015, Bomeny\u2019s entities paid $65 million for the property. The 10-story hotel was completed in 1950, records show.\nA year before Bomeny\u2019s entities purchased the property, the previous owner secured city approvals for a project dubbed\nRegalia on the Bay\n. Designed by Arquitectonica, the 82-story, 950,000-square-foot tower was planned to include 374 condos, 120 hotel rooms, offices, and retail, along with 500 parking spaces.\nJudge Isicoff also authorized the closure of the existing Holiday Inn upon execution of a purchase agreement, with the hotel\u2019s franchise license set to terminate on Jan. 5.\nBomeny was a development partner in the Zaha Hadid\u2013designed\nOne Thousand Museum\ncondo tower in downtown Miami, and\nRegalia Residences\nin Sunny Isles Beach.",

        "content": "The Riviera Beach Community Redevelopment Agency will negotiate the sale of 2.2 acres near the waterfront to Peter Baytarian\u2019s Forest Development to build a mixed-use project.\nRiviera Beach council members, sitting as the city\u2019s CRA\u2019s board of commissioners, approved the deal with North Palm Beach-based Forest Development by a vote of 3 to 2 Wednesday evening, after hearing proposals from five development teams. Council Chairperson Shirley Lanier and Vice Chair KaShamba Miller-Anderson cast the dissenting votes.\nWayne Richards, Forest Development\u2019s attorney, told council members that Baytarian was eager to build a $325 million project at 1851 Broadway with 350 to 450 apartments, including 20 as workforce housing. The project would also include 17,000 square feet of retail and would break ground within 18 months of site plan approval.\n\u201cWhen I asked him about timing, he said \u2018full speed ahead.\u2019 He wants to hit this market while it\u2019s hot,\u201d Richards said.\nBaytarian told council members he was also willing to increase his current bid of $3.78 million to acquire land owned by the city and the CRA.\nShould Baytarian move forward, this would be his third project along the Broadway/U.S. 1 corridor. Richards said Forest Development is just days away from getting a certificate of occupancy for a pair of 24-story condo towers called\nNautilus 220\nin neighboring Lake Park, and months away from \u201csignificant movement\u201d at\nOculina\n, a planned 25-story dual condo tower project at 3700 Broadway.\nBaytarian\u2019s Forest Development made an unsolicited offer to acquire the 2.2-acre Riviera Beach parcel more than two years ago. In response, the city put out a request for proposals\nfrom other developers\ninterested in acquiring the property at 1851 Broadway for development.\nForest Development\u2019s proposal received the highest score from a selection committee of city administrators, despite having the lowest cash bid. That\u2019s because purchase price counted for just 15 percent of the selection committee\u2019s total scoring, while categories dealing with the project\u2019s design, community benefit package, and developer reputation each carried 20 percent, a CRA document explained.\nAccording to LaTonya Ammons, Riviera Beach\u2019s director of purchasing, if talks with Forest Development fall apart, the city could negotiate with the second-place contender, Washington, D.C.-based Frontier Development &amp; Hospitality Group and Deerfield Beach-based Gedeon Financial. Frontier and Gedeon proposed building 12,500 square feet of retail and 300 apartments with 75 percent of units reserved for workforce housing. Their bid included paying $4 million for the land. Woody Victor, senior vice president of Frontier Development, told council members his team was considering using the state\u2019s Live Local Act to gain extra density and, possibly, property tax abatements.\nThird-place contender, West Palm Beach-based\u00a0 Kenco Communities, had the highest cash bid of more than $4.55 million. It proposed building an eight-story building with 219 residential units, with up to 22 units for workforce housing.\nComing in fourth place was New York-based Coltown Properties, which proposed a project with 450 apartments. Its initial bid offered $4 million to the city, plus another $400,000 for the CRA for community enhancements. However, founding principal Steven Neuman told council members that Coltown was willing to pay at least $100,000 more than the highest bidder.\nThe last ranked contender was Palm Beach Gardens-based Elysium Land Development, headed by Eliott Johnson. Rather than buy the land, Johnson proposed forming a partnership with the city and other organizations to build a \u201ccommunity incubator\u201d that would include 106 affordable housing units.\nCouncil members initially planned to hear presentations from just\nthe top three ranked proposals\n. However, by a vote of 4 to 1 (councilman Glen Spirits dissenting) opted to hear all five proposals, partly because CRA Executive Director Gedel Merzius admitted he made a mistake when he told council members that Forest Development was the highest bidder during the CRA\u2019s Oct. 22 meeting.Riviera Beach officials have sought to attract development to expand their city\u2019s tax base to pay for infrastructure improvements such as a $400 million reconstruction of the city\u2019s defunct water plant. According to an analysis by\nThe Real Deal\n, nearly 2,000 condos and apartments are in\nRiviera Beach\u2019s residential development pipeline\n.",

        "content": "Outgoing Mayor Eric Adams appears to have weeded out any plan for incoming mayor Zohran Mamdani to\nreplace the Elizabeth Street Garden\nwith housing.\nThe mayor-elect said on Thursday, \u201cthe actions that the Adams administration has taken now make it nearly impossible to follow through\u201d with plans to build affordable housing at the oft-contested Nolita site, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The mention of \u201cnearly impossible\u201d suggests Mamdani may still find a way to get a housing project done there.\nBut Adams made that significantly more challenging last week when he designated the site as parkland and transferred ownership of the lot to the Parks Department. City Hall said the conversion, announced in the waning months of Adams\u2019 time in office, has been in the works since June.\nThe state Legislature would need to act for the land to be developed following the designation.\nMamdani was in good company as a critic of the designation. Gov. Kathy Hochul said Wednesday she would pursue parkland alienation for the site to \u201cundo this pathetic, lame-duck move.\u201d\n\u201cWith this disgraceful final act, the Adams administration is once again prioritizing elite comfort over affordable homes for vulnerable elderly people,\u201d Open New York chief of staff Andrew Fine said in a statement.\nAs of May,\nAdams supported the affordable living project\nslated to bring 123 units of senior housing to the site, but held off evicting the garden while First Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro was \u201creviewing\u201d the project.\nBut the administration\ncanceled\nplans in June, instead touting an agreement with Councilmember Chris Marte to rezone three other sites that would net 620 affordable units. Two of those sites, however, still lack attached developers, making it far from certain those projects will ever be built.\nThe canceled project involved a development partnership of Habitat for Humanity\u2019s regional affiliate, Pennrose and RiseBoro Community Partnership, which needed to overcome numerous legal obstacles to construct Haven Green, only to be foiled anyway.\n\u201cI think what they did undermines\nwhat the City of Yes\nis all about,\u201d Sabrina Lippman, CEO of Habitat for Humanity\u2019s regional affiliate, told Crain\u2019s\nafter the project cancellation\n. \u201cAnd it sets a really dangerous precedent for other affordable housing developers.\u201d\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner",

        "content": "After several lawsuits tried and failed to overturn New York\u2019s\nrent-stabilization law\n, a new complaint is taking a different approach.\nThe lawsuit, filed by the Small Property Owners of New York and a few individual landlords, takes aim at how the state law applies to vacant apartments. The complaint alleges that capping rents on vacant units violates the takings clause in the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution because it \u201cdirectly takes from the value of the apartment\u2019s leasehold.\u201d\nThat, the\nlawsuit\nalleges, results \u201ceither in a complete taking (by making it economically impossible to rent the leasehold) or a partial taking of the leasehold\u2019s value.\u201d\nAttorneys for the landlord said that, unlike previous lawsuits challenging the state\u2019s rent law, this complaint would not disrupt existing tenants. They hope this will help the case succeed where its\npredecessors\nhave failed.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not challenging the government\u2019s ability to protect existing tenants,\u201d said Robert Johnson, an attorney with the\nlibertarian-leaning\nnonprofit Institute for Justice, which is representing the plaintiffs pro bono. \u201cWhen an apartment is vacant, there is no tenant to protect, and it doesn\u2019t help anybody to have these units sit off the market.\u201d\nThe lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Manhattan this week, seeks to halt the application of rent stabilization rules on vacant apartments and calls for damages equal to the income lost by rent limitations on such apartments. The case names the city, the Rent Guidelines Board, the state and the Division of Homes and Community Renewal as defendants.\nThe complaint follows several other legal challenges to the state\u2019s rent law in recent years, including\none\nfiled by the Rent Stabilization Association and the Community Housing Improvement program, two groups that have since\nmerged\nto form the New York Apartment Association. Those groups, as well as plaintiffs in at least four other lawsuits targeting the law, tried to take their cases to the U.S. Supreme Court, which repeatedly\ndeclined\nto take up the issue.\n\u201cFor over 50 years, rent stabilization laws have kept rents affordable for millions of New York families, and state and federal courts have repeatedly upheld these laws, including as recently as\nlast year\n,\u201d a City Hall spokesperson said in a statement.\nEllen Davidson, an attorney with the Legal Aid Society, which intervened in the previous rent law cases on behalf of tenants and plans to do so in this lawsuit, said the latest case rehashes the arguments of the previous lawsuits, albeit with a focus on a subset of apartments.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same thing with new wrapping paper,\u201d she said.\nSimilar to SPONY\u2019s suit, previous cases also alleged violations of both the takings and due process clauses in the 14th Amendment. The latest case also claims that the law defies the privileges and immunities clause, which \u201cprotects their right to take, hold, and dispose of property,\u201d and the equal protections clause, \u201cbecause the owners of some vacant apartments are free to rent at market rates, while others are subject to crushing limitations.\u201d\n\u201cKeeping apartments empty is not the business model of small property owners,\u201d Ann Korchak, board president of SPONY, said in a statement. She said owners who can\u2019t raise the rents to levels that would help pay for necessary renovations are essentially forced to keep the units off the market.\nThe lawsuit describes different vacant apartments at 81 Cabrini Boulevard, a 30-unit building in Hudson Heights owned by brothers Pashko and Tony Lulgjuraj, who are plaintiffs in the case through an operating entity, RPN Management.\nThe brothers are keeping two of the building\u2019s apartments vacant \u201cbecause the regulated rent is so low that it does not make sense to put the units on the market,\u201d according to the lawsuit. The legal rent for one of those units is $710 per month, while an identical apartment the floor below (also stabilized) is renting for $2,595.\nThe second vacant unit has a legal rent of $860 per month, while a similar regulated apartment on the floor above it is being rented out for $3,000. The owners estimate that bringing the vacant units up to code would cost more than $100,000 per unit.\nAn entity tied to Bipin Mathew, which owns a six-unit building at 1819 Cornelia Street in Ridgewood, Queens, and an LLC tied to Ilan Rabinovitch, which owns a four-unit building at 135 West 78th Street, are also listed as plaintiffs in the lawsuit.\nBefore the\npassage\nof the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, landlords could increase rents on stabilized apartments in more ways. They could also deregulate apartments when they became vacant if rents reached a certain threshold. Davidson of the Legal Aid Society said returning the ability of landlords to deregulate vacant apartments would incentivize owners to drive tenants out of stabilized apartments.\n\u201cOur experience with pre-2019 rules is that anyone who lived in their apartment for more than 10 years had a target on their back,\u201d she said.\nLandlord groups have also\ntried\nto convince the state legislature to allow one-time rent resets for apartments that are vacated after a long tenancy, but lawmakers have shown little appetite for such changes. The state budget\nlast year\n, however, increased the amount that owners can increase rents after renovating stabilized apartments, but landlord groups argue that the change barely makes a dent in the capital needs for these buildings.\nIn an interview, plaintiff Pashko Lulgjuraj said he is hopeful that the SPONY lawsuit\u2019s approach will succeed.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking to bring down rent stabilization as we know it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is very narrow, very focused.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The\nLos Angeles City Council\nis cutting back on rent increases for\nrent-stabilized\napartments.\nOn Wednesday, the City Council voted 12\u20132 to approve changes to the city\u2019s Rent Stabilization Ordinance that affects about 624,000 residential units built on or before Oct. 1, 1978, Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The changes for the year from July 1, 2025 to June 30, 2026 call for a 1 percent floor and 4 percent ceiling on annual rent increases for these properties.\nUnder current regulations, landlords with units subject to the current rent stabilization guidelines are permitted to increase rent by either up to 8 percent or 3 percent plus the annual percentage change in the consumer price index in the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim area, whichever is lower.\nAbout 624,000 units across 118,000 properties are subject to the RSO, per\nL.A. Housing Department\ndata cited by Commercial Observer. More than half of renters in Los Angeles spend more than 30 percent of their monthly income on rent.\nThe proposal could keep some renters with tight budgets in their homes.\n\u201cWhat is happening, and I\u2019m seeing it among constituents, is that they\u2019re looking at the landscape of economic insecurity ahead\u2026 and they\u2019re choosing not to bet on L.A. anymore. And when our people leave, we lose what is best about L.A.,\u201d\nCouncilmember Nithya Raman\n, who proposed the changes, said ahead of the council\u2019s vote. \u201cOur affordability crisis is making L.A. less resilient and is making it less possible for people to live here.\u201d\nSo-called \u201cmom and pop\u201d landlords with smaller properties will be especially affected after dealing with pandemic-era rent freezes and the post-wildfire rent moratorium. Those owners of properties with two to 10 units will receive support for repairs and rehabilitation, Los Angeles Magazine\nreported\n. The changes could stand in the way of apartment owners keeping up with maintenance costs, opponents of the bill say. Developers might also shy away from proposing new multifamily projects.\n\u201cWe always argue that we don\u2019t want more corporate ownership [of residences]. What we\u2019re driving by doing these policies is for that to increase in the city of L.A.,\u201d Councilmember John Lee, who voted against the change, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be the cause of why people are not building here, because they can see that with a stroke of the pen, [the] council can do whatever it wants\u2026 This is just another example of how we\u2019re going to disincentivize building here in the City of L.A. and push more ownership into corporate ownership.\u201d\nThe rent stabilization changes expire next summer.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Gov. JB Pritzker is reviving his campaign to put homeowners\u2019 insurance rates under state scrutiny, weeks after a rate-review bill unexpectedly collapsed in the Illinois House.\nThe governor is leaning on a familiar example \u2014 State Farm\u2019s more than 27 percent spike in home insurance premiums this summer \u2014 to argue that Illinois is an outlier in leaving insurers unchecked, as homeowners shoulder some of the steepest increases in years, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nHomeowners insurance rates are ballooning across the country. But Illinois\u2019 home insurance premiums increased by\n50 percent\nbetween 2021 and 2024, the second-highest increase in the U.S.\nIllinois\u2019 regulatory void has become a political liability.\nPritzker\n, speaking Thursday in Chicago, framed the\nState Farm hike\nas exactly the kind of move that should trigger state oversight. The Bloomington-based giant blamed extreme weather and rising repair costs, but the governor said that explanation wasn\u2019t enough.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if homeowners are being gouged,\u201d he said, adding that a nearly 30 percent jump \u201cought to be reviewed by a state regulator.\u201d\nThe stalled bill would have allowed the Illinois Department of Insurance to vet and challenge rate increases deemed excessive or \u201cunfairly discriminatory.\u201d\nIt cleared the Senate 41-15 \u2014 with a small handful of Republicans joining Democrats \u2014 but fell four votes short in the House as the fall session closed. Several Democrats broke ranks, delivering Pritzker one of his few legislative setbacks in a chamber firmly controlled by his party.\nThe defeat was surprising given the public pressure campaign from Pritzker and legislative leaders.\nIn July, the governor co-authored an op-ed with\nHouse Speaker Emanuel \u201cChris\u201d Welch\nand Senate President Don Harmon urging State Farm to be more transparent. Welch\u2019s office told the outlet that leadership believed they had the votes, but \u201ca few people must have changed their minds after debate.\u201d\nOne of the Democratic holdouts was Rep. Thaddeus Jones, chair of the House Insurance Committee and mayor of Calumet City, who argued the bill ignored auto insurance \u2014 a bigger pain point for consumers, he said.\nJones didn\u2019t vote \u201cno\u201d but encouraged colleagues to tank the measure, calling for a more comprehensive overhaul. Campaign disclosures show he received about $20,000 in contributions from insurance interests this year, including $4,000 from a State Farm-aligned PAC, a common dynamic for committee chairs overseeing major industries.\nThe veto-session version of the bill had been scaled back from earlier drafts that paired oversight of home and auto coverage. It also would have required insurers to warn policyholders and state regulators 60 days before any premium increase above 10 percent. House Majority Leader Robyn Gabel, the bill\u2019s lead sponsor, said that window would give homeowners a realistic chance to shop for alternatives.\nState Farm countered that more oversight would backfire by making the market less competitive. The company cited inflation, costly weather events and major wildfire losses outside Illinois. It said it paid out $1.26 for every $1 of homeowner premium collected in the state last year, including $638 million in hail damage alone.\nRepublicans framed the proposal as overreach. Rep. Jeff Keicher, a State Farm agent, said it would \u201cturn the industry on its head\u201d without addressing litigation and other cost drivers.\nHarmon said Thursday he expects the House to take another run at the bill this spring.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The Goel entity then secured a $28 million loan for the property from Timberlake Mortgage.\nGoel applied to build 314 apartments with 7,100 square feet of retail space at the corner of Main and A streets. Nineteen of the units were to be set aside for\nlow-income and very-low-income income\nresidents.\nHayward officials approved the project in 2022, lauded as a development to increase housing supply, but construction never started.\nThe City of Hayward is mandated by the state to plan for 4,624 total new housing units by 2031 as part of its\nhousing element\n.\nOther housing developments in the pipeline in Hayward include a four-story, 30-unit complex proposed by Zibasara. That project was\napproved\nlast year for a 1-acre site at 22422 Rockaway Lane.\nEarlier this month, Namdar Realty Group\nbought the Southland Mall\nin Hayward from\nBrookfield Properties\nfor $70 million cash. The purchase price worked out to $64 per square foot for the 1.1 million-square-foot retail complex anchored by Macy\u2019s, JCPenney, Ross Dress for Less, Hobby Lobby and Cinemark.\nHouston-based Goel took a spin in the Chicago multifamily market\u2019s wild ride to recovery recently. The landlord was struggling to turn a profit on a\nhigh-interest, $130 million loan from MF1\nahead of its May 2024 maturity. But Goel landed $130 million refinancing from Bridge Investment Group in July for the property, at 500 Station Boulevard in Aurora, as Chicago\u2019s market bounced back.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",
