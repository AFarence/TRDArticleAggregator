        "content": "Gary Barnett\u2019s catchphrase in recent months may as well be \u201cbigger is better.\u201d\nExtell Development filed plans to nearly triple the height of a\nproject at 871 Seventh Avenue\nin Midtown Manhattan, the site of the now-closed Wellington Hotel, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Where the firm once sought a 27-story hotel, it\u2019s now pursuing a 71-story mixed-use project.\nThe development would be 1,050-feet tall and span 484,000 square feet, according to an application with the Department of City Planning.\nA majority of that space would be residential, calling for 130 units, but there would also be 159,000 square feet of hotel space \u2014 156 rooms \u2014 and 24,000 square feet for retail. Plans also call for a 55-car garage on the second floor and a two-car elevator.\nAs a trade-off for the expansion, Extell would make improvements to the subway station at 50th Street and Broadway, particularly in terms of accessibility.\nBarnett\u2019s firm did not respond to the outlet\u2019s request for comment.\n\nExtell acquired the site of the Wellington Hotel in 2022, making a $94.5 million deal with Richard Born\u2019s BD Hotels; Born remains involved with the project. The hotel closed during the pandemic.\nA few months ago, Extell revealed a similar plan to greatly enlarge a project in Midtown. Extell\nfiled a rezoning application\nfor 655 Madison Avenue, eyeing a 74-story property, or double the number of stories Barnett\nplotted\nfor when he first filed plans for the site last fall.\nThe rezoning application detailed a 765,000-square-foot project that would stand 1,162 feet tall and feature 154 residential units. The residential space would span 476,000 square feet, while the 233,000 square feet of commercial space would be split between office and retail, the majority dedicated to the former.\nSimilar to the Seventh Avenue site, Barnett is bargaining with the city on the rezoning application, offering improvements to the Fifth Avenue/59th Street N/R/W subway station in exchange for 130,000 square feet of space.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The Villages is betting big on the municipal bond market to keep its housing boom alive.\nThe sprawling 57,000-acre retirement empire in central Florida is selling nearly $130 million in high-yield municipal bonds to fund a 2,800-home district, Bloomberg\nreported\n. The sale, handled by Jefferies and Morgan Stanley, will bankroll infrastructure for the next phase of The Villages\u2019 long-term buildout, such as roads, bridges, irrigation and 36 new golf holes.\nThe project is part of a 20-year plan that could swell the community\u2019s population by 60 percent to roughly 260,000 residents by 2045.\nThe deal comes with notable risk. The bonds are unrated and fall into two of the municipal market\u2019s most volatile sectors:\nsenior housing\nand real estate. Offering documents warn of potential pitfalls from\nhurricanes\nto liquidity shortages. Yet analysts say the project has strong fundamentals with permits secured and steady demand from the retiree pipeline.\nFounded in the 1980s by developer H. Gary Morse and still run by his family, The Villages has evolved from pasture and wetlands into a full-fledged city for the 55-and-up set. The master-planned community includes some 60\ngolf courses\n, 3,000 social clubs and its own media ecosystem. Rules ban everything from window air conditioning units to political yard signs, though dueling golf cart parades are an election season staple.\n\nForthcoming homes are expected to average about $400,000, according to bond documents; the community\u2019s broader inventory ranges from $200,000 villas to million-dollar estates. The\nbonds\nwill be backed by property assessments levied on the new lots, a structure familiar to muni investors who\u2019ve financed past phases of the development.\nThe Villages has tapped bond buyers before: A separate entity issued $260 million in taxable debt earlier this year, backed by amenity fees and recreation revenues. Those bonds, rated AA-, priced at a 5.2 percent yield.\nWhile the new issue lacks a rating, investors like Lord Abbett\u2019s Daniel Solender expect demand to hold.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Chicago Fire FC is setting up shop a few blocks north from its current offices as it pushes ahead with a new South Loop stadium.\nThe Major League Soccer team signed a lease for about 29,000 square feet at the Wrigley Building,\n400\u2013410 North Michigan Avenue\n, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The Fire will relocate its headquarters to the 14th floor of the landmark tower in the coming months \u2014 a move into a property owned by Fire\u2019s billionaire owner and Morningstar founder Joe Mansueto.\nThe new lease means the Fire is leaving behind more than 52,000 square feet at 1 North Dearborn Street when its lease expires early next year.\nThe relocation cuts the team\u2019s office footprint nearly in half, extending a post-pandemic trend of tenant rightsizing. The Fire didn\u2019t comment on the downsizing, but the outlet reported sources said the team didn\u2019t need all the space it leased on Dearborn, a full floor originally built out for floral delivery firm FTD before its 2019 bankruptcy.\nThe new address keeps the club close to home.\nMansueto\npurchased the Wrigley Building for $255 million in 2018. The lease helps push occupancy at the two-tower property, with the Fire\u2019s office set to span both with a link by enclosed walkway, to roughly 90 percent, according to CoStar. Perkins &amp; Will remains the building\u2019s largest tenant, with about 65,000 square feet.\n\nThe Fire\u2019s shift north comes as Mansueto and Related Midwest prepare to break ground on a $750 million, 22,000-seat stadium at\nThe 78\n, Related\u2019s 62-acre megadevelopment site along the Chicago River just south of Roosevelt Road. The Chicago City Council\nsigned off\non the plan last month, paving the way for the club to leave Soldier Field by the 2028 season.\nWhile the Wrigley lease shores up Mansueto\u2019s downtown real estate, it creates a new challenge for the owners of 1 North Dearborn. The 938,000-square-foot Loop tower, held by Beacon Capital Partners and MetLife, has weathered a wave of tenant churn better than most. Despite Salesforce vacating 38,000 square feet last year, the landlords quickly filled the gap with a long-term deal from early education nonprofit Start Early. The building remains 93 percent leased, bolstered by Chicago Public Schools\u2019 headquarters.\nThe Fire\u2019s new digs may be smaller, but the move anchors the team in a Mansueto-owned trophy.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Susan Stiles, co-founder of Compass\u2019 Trigaci Stiles Group, had the listing.\nIt had an asking price of $4.4 million when it went under contract on Oct. 18. The seller, Loretta Lowe, bought it last July when it was listed for $4.5 million, according to county records and Zillow.\nThe property\u2019s price history suggests that Lowe sold it for a small loss, but since Texas does not require final sales price disclosure, that\u2019s not certain.\nThe home built in 2012 is in the Spanish Oaks neighborhood, a guard-gated community anchored by the highly ranked Spanish Oaks Golf Club. The neighborhood is about 30 minutes west of downtown Austin.\n\nWhile the Austin area has generally remained\nbelow six months of inventory this year\n, it\u2019s considered a\nbuyer\u2019s market\n. There were 124 percent more sellers than buyers in July; in September, the percentage grew to 130 percent, making Austin the most imbalanced market in the country, according to\nRedfin\n.\nLuxury\nhasn\u2019t gone unscathed. Most of Austin\u2019s top public sales in recent weeks have been offering\nprice cuts\n, and some have beckoned sellers with location rather than luxury, with agents marketing homes\u2019\nteardown potential\n.\nEven homes that would have sold off the market in previous years are\nmoving to the MLS\nas sellers trade the property tax benefit of price secrecy for the sales advantage of high exposure.\nOther Texas cities aren\u2019t faring much better. A seller-to-buyer difference lower than 10 percent is considered a balanced market. San Antonio and Dallas both have about 100 percent more sellers than buyers, or about two sellers for every buyer, according to Redfin. Houston has 84 percent more sellers than buyers, and Fort Worth has 68 percent.\n",

Average rents hover around $68 per square foot, which is relatively cheap for Class A space with direct access to six subway lines, four of them express.\nThe tenant roster has shifted since Milbank\u2019s exit.

The parcels in question include a vacant lot across from the University of Southern California and a hillside parcel on downtown\u2019s Bunker Hill.\nIn Exposition Park, the site at\n3685 South Vermont Avenue\nwas the former site of the Bethune Library. The City of Los Angeles had tapped Orion Capital to build a 168-room Courtyard by Marriott at the site.\nThe deal, supported by City Council president Marqueece Harris-Dawson unraveled after the project faced opposition from the city\u2019s own zoning administrator and South Los Angeles Area Planning Commission. That led the City Council to step in and force its construction, a move that prompted a lawsuit from Strategic Actions for a Just Economy,\u00a0 a nonprofit group that challenged the entitlements for the Bethune site. The proposal eventually ground to a halt.\n\nThe Bunker Hill Y-1 parcel, located at Fourth and Hill Streets, was once slated for Angels Landing, a\ntwo-tower project approved by the city in partnership with\nMacFarlane Partners\nand the Peebles Corporation.\nThat $1.6 billion plan called for two skyscrapers rising 64 and 42 stories with more than 400 units, two hotels and retail space.\nThe developers\nfaced off\nagainst former\nCity Councilmember Kevin de Le\u00f3n\n, who represented downtown, leaving the proposal dead in the water. The developers ultimately sued the City over the collapse of the deal.\nNow that the City\u2019s option agreements for both sites have expired, CRA/LA is required by state law to declare the properties as surplus land, meaning it will have to first offer both properties to affordable housing developers during a 60-day exclusive window. If no developers respond or reach an agreement, the agency can then market the parcels more broadly.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The embattled former Greyhound bus terminal in downtown San Jose has a new owner after a foreclosure process involving nearly $23 million in debt.\nA lender group led by\nNew York developer Chris Jiashu Xu\nand business executive William Wang has taken over the Greyhound site at 60-70 South Almaden Avenue in a $22.2 million\nforeclosure proceeding\n, The Mercury News\nreported\n. The foreclosure comes after an affiliate of China-based\nZ&amp;L Properties defaulted\non a $19.5 million loan.\nZ&amp;L had been approved to build a 708-unit residential tower at the site but never broke ground. The company fought to keep the site via two Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases and a lawsuit to block the foreclosure, but they were unsuccessful. Z&amp;L claimed it spent $44.2 million on land purchase and pre-construction costs before the asset was seized. The new owners aren\u2019t looking to deviate from that plan.\n\u201cThe vacant land at issue is a rotting, empty former Greyhound Station,\u201d the lender said in a U.S. Bankruptcy Court filing. \u201cIf allowed to proceed [with foreclosure], the lender has the resources to develop this piece of property as originally entitled.\u201d\n\nWith the Greyhound terminal now out of its hands, Z&amp;L Properties, which once boasted a large real estate empire in the Bay Area, now owns just one property. A Z&amp;L affiliate\nowns a historic church at 43 East Saint James Street\n. Z&amp;L previously proposed a two-tower housing development at that site, which would also renovate the aging church. But, as with its plans for the Greyhound station, the project remains at a standstill.\nXu\u2019s real estate activity has largely been concentrated in the New York City area. The developer counts residential towers and a hotel in Queens among his developments. In San Jose, in January of last year, a group led by the developer\nacquired most of the Eastridge Center\nshopping mall in East San Jose for $135 million.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "One of New York\u2019s top lenders to rent-stabilized property owners is continuing to pull back its portfolio.\nFlagstar Bank still has nearly $9.59 billion in loans tied to heavily rent-stabilized buildings on its books, according to an earnings presentation Friday. But that\u2019s down about $324 million from the last time the bank\nreported\nits numbers, in July.\nThe\ndecrease\nis part of Flagstar\u2019s effort to right the ship after a disastrous 2024, when the company disclosed issues with its lending and sparked a stock sell-off that pushed it to the brink of collapse. The bank posted a net loss in the third quarter of 2025, but its smallest since 2023, at eleven cents per share.\nAbout 60 percent of Flagstar\u2019s loans to New York City multifamily buildings are tied to heavily rent-stabilized properties.\nOf its loans tied to New York City rent-stabilized buildings, about 45 percent have some financial red flags, according to Flagstar. Nearly half of those red-flag loans are not accruing interest and have been charged off.\nThe value of those loans is equal to about 80 percent of the appraised value of the properties. Net profits of those properties are slightly higher than their annual debt service.\n\u201cWe think we\u2019re more than covered, were there to be any further degradation in this portion of the portfolio,\u201d said Lee Smith, Flagstar\u2019s CFO.\nThose properties are 99 percent occupied, up slightly from last quarter, and 80 percent have seen a recent appraisal, according to Flagstar.\n\nMayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani has proposed freezing rents in rent-stabilized apartments. That would stymie revenue growth at a time the sector has seen growing distress, although the impact may not be felt for some time.\n\u201cThe way you model that out is you just make the assumption they\u2019re going to be flat revenues,\u201d said Joseph Otting, Flagstar\u2019s CEO. \u201cYou really need to understand the expense side because that\u2019ll make the difference on whether these properties are positive on a cash flow basis.\u201d\nExpenses for New York real estate have gone up significantly, most notably insurance costs.\nThe bigger impact on the properties may come from reductions in interest rates, Smith said. That could benefit owners struggling with debt.\nFlagstar has seen $372 million in net charge-offs for its total New York City multifamily portfolio since January 2024.\nThe bank will start originating new loans for commercial real estate, but outside New York, Smith said.\n\u201cThis won\u2019t be rent-regulated New York City loans,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for high-quality, geographically-diversified CRE loans in other parts of that footprint \u2014 the Midwest, California, South Florida.\u201d\n",

        "content": "More than a decade after sparking a squabble over housing in the Mission District, an affordable residential development is moving forward in the neighborhood.\nOn Wednesday, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors Budget and Finance Committee unanimously approved $60 million in revenue bonds for La Maravilla, a three-building, 350-unit supportive housing complex developed by the Mission Economic Development Agency and Mission Housing, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n.\nThe $110 million La Maravilla project is set to rise over the 16th Street\nBART station\n. Developer\nMaximus Real Estate Partners\nacquired the site on the northeast corner of 16th and Mission in 2013 and proposed building 330 market-rate apartments \u2014 an idea that became known as\n\u201cThe Monster in the Mission\u201d\nby opponents in the area.\nNeighborhood activists formed the Plaza 16 Coalition to advocate for affordable housing in the area to avoid the displacement of locals. In response, the city\u2019s planning department put a temporary moratorium on market-rate housing in the Mission District. Eventually, the Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing and Community Development acquired the 16th Street BART site from Maximus.\nAt the same time, several\naffordable housing projects\nbegan sprouting up. This included 168 units at 1515 South Van Ness Avenue, 81 units at 490 South Van Ness Avenue, 157 units at 1950 Mission Street and 127 units at 2060 Folsom Street. In total, approximately 800 affordable apartments have been built and another 600 are in the pipeline.\n\nThose developments came about thanks to the work of the Plaza 16 Coalition, according to Sam Moss, executive director of Mission Housing.\n\u201cOne of the most important aspects of the Maravilla is that it is being developed by Mission community orgs for the Mission community,\u201d Moss told the Chronicle. \u201cThe developer fees, the resources, the financing \u2014 it\u2019s all staying in the Mission.\u201d\nDemolition at the 16th and Mission site for December and construction will begin in January.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Retailers are racing to secure space in\nNorth Texas\u2019 fastest-growing suburbs\n, even with climbing construction costs and\nsoaring rents\n.\nIn Prosper, Celina and\nMelissa\n, asking rents for new retail space have surged from the mid-$30s per square foot five years ago to as high as $50 per square foot today, a jump of about 42 percent, Bisnow\nreported\n, citing a Weitzman report.\nThat works out to an annual base rent of about $100,000 for a 2,000-square-foot space, or around $8,300 per month. The price tag means small independent businesses won\u2019t be a major part of the retail landscape in these fast-growing suburbs, Bisnow said.\nThe spike is traceable to rising construction costs that developers say is forcing their hand, said Weitzman\u2019s Ben Terry.\n\u201cThe only way a developer can make these projects pencil is, unfortunately, by raising the rents,\u201d Terry told the outlet.\nWeitzman recently delivered the first 36,000-square-foot phase of The Creeks at Celina, a shopping center less than a half-mile from Dallas Parkway. Bids for the project\u2019s second phase came in roughly 20 percent higher than the first, Terry said, adding pressure to push rents higher.\nDespite the sticker shock, the appetite for space hasn\u2019t slowed. Household incomes in\nCelina\nand\nProsper\n\u2014 averaging $156,000 and $187,000, respectively \u2014 have given retailers confidence that consumers can handle higher price points. Around The Creeks at Celina, average household income tops $238,000, according to Weitzman.\nRegionally, limited supply and surging demand drove annual rent growth of 4.3 percent across DFW during the third quarter, per Matthews. The metro\u2019s average asking rent of $25.15 per square foot lags the wealthy northern suburbs, where Frisco leads at just over $40 per square foot and Allen and McKinney each top $30.\n\nA Coda Consulting Group report found that new retail construction in Prosper and McKinney commonly leases in the mid- to high-$40s per square foot, with restaurants exceeding $50. Vacancy rates remain tight \u2014 under 3.5 percent in McKinney and Frisco, and 4.3 percent in Allen.\nDevelopers blame rising material and labor costs \u2014 worsened by trade restrictions and immigration curbs \u2014 for the pricing pressure. Nonresidential construction costs are up 2.6 percent year-over-year nationwide, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nGrocery anchors like H-E-B, Kroger and Walmart are increasingly buying their own sites to sidestep soaring rents.\nCoda\u2019s Coni Hennersdorf said construction remains strongest in areas with available land. Allen, McKinney and Frisco together have about 900,000 square feet of retail under construction \u2014 13 percent of the DFW pipeline.\nTo offset costs, developers are leaning more on restaurant tenants, which generate higher sales and can absorb higher rents. Chad Long, VP of commercial development at Wilks Development, said restaurant-heavy projects like Frisco\u2019s multibillion-dollar Firefly Park are designed for affluent consumers.\nWeitzman is planning another 17,000-square-foot retail project in Flower Mound as part of a larger mixed-use development, with a $50 per square foot rent \u201cfloor.\u201d Terry said tenant demand there has been \u201cfantastic.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The residential condo board at 75 Wall Street scored a win in its dispute with its downstairs neighbor.\nThe board at the Financial District luxury condominium, which sits atop the Hyatt Centric Wall Street Hotel,\nfiled a lawsuit in May\narguing that the hotel owed nearly half a million dollars in unpaid common and utility charges.\nThe suit was filed on behalf of the property master board, which is made up of three residential members and four representatives affiliated with the hotel. This week, the judge ruled that residential members of the master board may place a lien on the hotel unit until its balances have been paid.\nThe judge also prohibited the hotel\u2019s board affiliates, which constitute a majority on the master board, from taking any action on behalf of the master board or holding a special meeting, something that the hotel\u2019s affiliated board members repeatedly tried to do in the wake of the lawsuit being filed.\nThe residential board said in a statement it was pleased with the judge\u2019s ruling. The hotel did not respond to a request for comment.\nPassing the buck\nThings have been awkward at the building for some time now, in what has essentially turned into a bad roommate situation, replete with unattended house meetings and bickering about who owes what.\nThe hotel is owned by an entity affiliated with Naveen Shah\u2019s Navika Capital, which purchased the portion of the building in 2021\nfor $85 million\n. The condo board claimed that the hotel stopped paying utility charges in January 2023 and has not kept current with common charges and special assessments levied since April 2024.\nIn May 2024, the building\u2019s general manager emailed the master board, telling them that she had continued \u201cto receive emails and calls on a daily basis from vendors wanting to know when they can expect payment,\u201d adding that the vendors were \u201cbeyond frustrated and have threatened to suspend services or file a lien if payment is not received soon.\u201d\nAt that point, the hotel allegedly owed nearly $320,000 in unpaid charges. The master board tried to hold a special meeting in June, but the hotel\u2019s representatives refused to attend, according to testimony from Dhwani Srivastava, the residential and master board president.\n\nThe following September, Srivastava emailed the master board to demand that outstanding balances be paid.\nThis time, the hotel\u2019s board members ordered a special meeting in October, where they agreed to deposit $135,000 into escrow, according to Srivastava.\nBy March of this year, the funds had not been deposited and the master board took a vote to place a lien on the hotel unit. The vote was defeated, given the hotel\u2019s majority representation on the board, according to Srivastava.\nIn response, the hotel representatives tried to hold another special meeting in June in an alleged attempt to remove Srivastava as president and replace the master board\u2019s general counsel with the law firm currently representing them, according to Srivastava.\nWhile the two sides argued in court over whether Shah and the hotel representatives had the authority to hold a special meeting, Con Edison informed the building\u2019s general manager on June 18 that service would be shut off by 3:30 p.m. that day if payment was not received.\nShah wired roughly $101,000 that day to pay off a portion of the arrears, but substantially less than the amount the residential board claimed the hotel owed, which had ballooned to over $500,000 by the end of June.\nThe hotel\u2019s board members sought to hold another special meeting in July, which the judge ruled they were ineligible to organize, given they still owed outstanding balances.\nThe dispute will now likely center on how much the hotel actually owes. The hotel allegedly is behind on almost $360,000 in utility charges, of which it paid roughly two-thirds \u201cunder protest\u201d on June 30. The hotel has claimed it doesn\u2019t owe the remainder of that balance due to incorrect electrical billing.\nThe board is seeking an additional $700,000 for the hotel unit\u2019s alleged breach of its fiduciary duty.\n",

        "content": "TA Realty picked up a 476-unit apartment complex in Palm Beach Gardens for $193 million, marking a continuing uptick of multifamily investment sales in South Florida.\nBoston-based TA Realty bought the gated garden-style community at 100 Portofino Drive from New York-based Blackstone, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The deal breaks down to $405,462 per unit.\nTA Realty assumed Blackstone\u2019s existing $108.5 million Freddie Mac loan on the property, records show. Generally, buyers\u2019 assumption of sellers\u2019 existing loans on properties allows the buyers to secure debt with a lower interest rate. The practice has become more common in the past three years due to elevated interest rates.\nCompleted in 2002 and 2003, the complex consists of 31 two-story apartment buildings on a 31-acre site, Vizzda records show. The community, previously called San Merano at Mirasol, has one- to three-bedroom apartments, according to Apartments.com. Rents aren\u2019t listed.\nTA Realty previously owned the complex, purchasing it for $69.1 million from developer Kolter in 2010. In 2017, TA Realty sold it to Blackstone, led by Stephen Schwarzman, for $103.6 million, according to records.\nTA Realty \u2013\u2013 led by managing partners James Buckingham, Michael Haggerty and James Raisides \u2013\u2013 has roughly $19 billion of assets under management across commercial property types, according to its website.\n\nIn January, TA Realty paid\n$118 million\nfor the 300-unit Pines West apartment complex at 16700 Sheridan Street in Pembroke Pines.\nIn June, the firm bought a 43.7-acre industrial development site in Opa-locka from Blackstone for\n$105.7 million\n. The site at 12691 Northwest LeJeune Road is planned as the second phase of Ironwood Commerce Center. TA Realty also bought the completed portion of Ironwood Commerce Center at 12700 Northwest 42nd Avenue for\n$160 million\nfrom Blackstone and its Link Logistics affiliate in December. Blackstone and its Link Logistics subsidiary have been unloading industrial properties in South Florida over the past year, with the selloff totaling roughly\n$1 billion\n.\nSouth Florida multifamily sales have picked up this year after slowing last year largely due to the higher interest rates. Many buyers are relying on discretionary funds, which need to deploy capital; Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae loans; and debt from insurance companies. Others are assuming sellers\u2019 loans or purchasing all cash.\nThis month, Tishman Speyer bought the 270-unit Bell at Broken Sound at 5500 Broken Sound Boulevard Northwest and 950 Northwest Broken Sound Parkway in Boca Raton for\n$124.5 million\n. Tishman Speyer used a $78.4 million Fannie Mae loan for the purchase.\nAlso this month, Morgan Properties paid\n$69.95 million\nfor the 300-unit Visions at Willow Pond complex at 4860 Sand Stone Lane near West Palm Beach. Morgan borrowed a $49.9 million Freddie Mac loan for the purchase.\nIn August, Related Fund Management bought the 292-unit Aura Delray Beach at 2095 West Atlantic Avenue in Delray Beach for\n$116.9 million\n. The buyer also used a $59.1 million Freddie Mac loan for the purchase.\n",

The dustup started when county officials\u00a0 informed the\nCity of Santa Monica\nthat two former senior living properties on the 400 and 800 blocks of Ocean Avenue will be turned into temporary housing for 49 people with behavioral health challenges, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n.\nThe incoming residents are enrolled in the county\u2019s\ntransitional housing\nprogram.\nSanta Monica Mayor Lana Negrete joined residents in criticizing the move by the county.\n\u201cThe system is not working fairly and informing people and it\u2019s above our heads often coming from state and county \u2014 yet we have to manage the chaos,\u201d Negrete told the Times. \u201cI think everybody deserves to know what is happening in their community and to be able to voice their concern, and shouldn\u2019t be chastised or villainized for having a response or a fear.\u201d\n\nFor now, the county has hit pause as it prepares to host a town hall and offer public tours of the facilities.\n\u201cWe want to ensure that everyone is heard, properly informed, and has multiple opportunities to provide feedback and help shape how the project is implemented,\u201d the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health said in a statement.\nL.A. County operates the largest county-run mental health department in the country, boasting a budget of nearly $3 billion. Last year, L.A. was one of 10 counties to receive nearly $133 million with the purpose of housing homeless people and those experiencing mental illness. That funding includes the Ocean Avenue transitional housing in question.\nThe\nVenice\n-based nonprofit St. Joseph Center will manage the facilities while the Department of Mental Health will operate the properties through the state\u2019s Behavioral Health Bridge Housing fund. The goal with the incoming residents is to transition them into secure housing while providing mental health treatment and other resources. The buildings will be staffed by medical professionals including mental health clinicians, licensed vocational nurses and substance use counselors. St. Joseph Center will provide around-the-clock security.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Hyperion Group has teamed up with a veteran New York real estate investor to buy a\nNew Jersey rental building\nwhose owners were struggling to refinance the CMBS loan.\nHyperionMFP Partners, a joint venture between the New York- and South Florida-based investment and development firm and Lawrence Benenson of Benenson Capital Partners, snapped up The Centre, a 314-unit luxury rental building in Cliffside Park, New Jersey, for $165 million in an off-market deal.\n\u201cWe were attracted to the property, and it was a good opportunity, given market conditions,\u201d said Hyperion\u2019s Rob Vecsler.\nCompleted in 2017, The Centre sits in the heart of Cliffside Park\u2019s business district and has 50,000 square feet of retail. The seller, Arilex Realty, controlled by Arianne Schreer and Alexis Pizzurro \u2014 daughters of veteran Gold Coast developer James Demetrakis \u2014 financed the building with a $130 million CMBS loan after paying off a TPG Real Estate Finance bridge loan in 2017.\n\nThe property has maintained occupancy above 90 percent and generates cash flow stronger than initial underwriting expectations, with a debt service coverage ratio of 2.4, according to Morningstar. As of July, the building was 97 percent occupied, with an average rent of $3,200, per Trepp.\nBut when the CMBS debt matured in July 2024, Arilex was unable to refinance. A two-month forbearance expired in early September, and the loan\u2019s special servicer began modification talks as higher interest rates squeezed valuations and lending terms.\nA recent appraisal valued the property at $161.1 million, about 14 percent below its $188 million valuation when the mortgage was issued.\nThe sale effectively resolves the debt issue while giving the new venture a foothold in one of northern New Jersey\u2019s strongest rental markets. Vecsler said it will target similar opportunities in the Tristate region and South Florida, where it sees opportunity for rent growth and asset appreciation.\n",

        "content": "In the fall of 2023, developer Michael Shvo told a crowd of real estate professionals that buyers were paying up to $12,000 per square foot for condos at the planned ultra-luxury Raleigh project in Miami Beach.\n\u201cWe probably have the most expensive product in Miami Beach,\u201d\nShvo said\nat\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s Showcase and Forum. \u201cWe are seeing high-profile buyers,\u201d including from Middle East countries like Qatar and Turkey.\nAt the time, Shvo was leading the planned redevelopment of the Raleigh, South Seas and Richmond hotels on Collins Avenue into a 60-key hotel and 42-unit condominium. The project was closely followed by many who wanted to see the iconic Art Deco Raleigh brought back to life after years of dormancy.\nIt also marked Shvo\u2019s trophy asset in one of the hottest markets in the country, where his pipeline also included three planned Class A office projects in Miami Beach.\nBut just two years later, Shvo this month\nsold the Raleigh assemblage\nto New York-based Nahla Capital for $270 million. In September, he sold\nThe Alton office development site\nvia a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure to Infinity Collective for $28.3 million.\nAn affiliate of New York-based Shvo, the developer\u2019s company, still owns an office development site on Washington Avenue in Miami Beach. The third office project was planned for the clock tower building on Lincoln Road, but Shvo did not end up purchasing the property.\nThe sale of the Raleigh marks a dramatic exit for Shvo. He declined to comment for this story through a spokesperson.\nShvo\u2019s timeline\nShvo made a big splash in 2019 when he and his then-partners, Bilgili Holdings and Deutsche Finance America, acquired the three hotels that make up the nearly 3-acre Raleigh assemblage, paying a\ncombined $242.9 million\n. That included Tommy Hilfiger and the Dogus Group\u2019s sale of the Raleigh at 1775 Collins Avenue in Miami Beach for $103 million earlier that same year. The property, known for its fleur-de-lis-shaped pool, had been shuttered since Hurricane Irma hit South Florida in September of 2017.\nTurkish investor Serdar Bilgili\u2019s Bilgili Holdings eventually exited the project following a court settlement of a\ndispute\nwith Shvo.\nShvo and his team worked on plans for the project, and in 2022 marked a few milestones. The Miami Beach Historic Preservation Board\napproved changes\nthat allowed for a deeper underground garage.\n\nShvo also announced that Rosewood Hotels &amp; Resorts would brand the planned 17-story, 44-unit condo tower and manage the 60-key hotel. Cheval Blanc, a luxury hotel group owned by LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, was expected to brand the hotel, but that deal fell through, sources told\nTRD\nat the time.\nA year later in 2023, Shvo launched condo sales. The developer tapped Oren and Tal Alexander\u2019s Side-backed brokerage, Official, to lead sales and marketing. But the developer took a more extreme approach than the competition, one that industry experts said contributed to the project\u2019s downfall. The invitation-only strategy focused on Rosewood VIPs and friends of Shvo and New York architect Peter Marino. (Marino designed the plans along with Kobi Karp Architecture &amp; Interior Design.)\nIn the summer of 2023, Shvo and his partners secured\na $190 million refinancing\noriginated by BH3, a Fort Lauderdale-based lender, investment and development firm led by Dan Lebensohn and Greg Freedman. It paid off a $146.9 million loan that Acore Capital provided in 2019.\nSources told\nTRD\nthat presales lagged behind competitors such as Witkoff and Monroe Capital\u2019s Auberge-branded redevelopment of the\nShore Club property\na few blocks away at 1901 Collins Avenue.\nSome say the market for ultra luxury condo developments has softened following the post-pandemic boom. While most developers are delayed in completing their projects, construction under Shvo\u2019s ownership never went vertical. The Raleigh was originally expected to be completed in 2026.\nIt didn\u2019t help that a year after hiring Official, rape allegations against the Alexander brothers surfaced that ultimately led to Oren and Tal Alexander stepping away from the business, and developers who worked with the brokerage severed ties.\nAna Bozovic, broker and founder of Analytics Miami, said Shvo\u2019s sale of the property is more of a reflection of the challenges the capital markets are facing than it was about his sales strategy.\n\u201cWhen I see that this project has failed, with the construct of his involvement, the first thing that comes to my mind is challenges with capital markets,\u201d Bozovic said. \u201c[Developers] who had time pressure to perform have been ultra-challenged.\u201d\nBozovic said that buyers with cash to spend have options. The fact that the project\u2019s performance and delays were publicized likely introduced fear into the project, she said.\nSigns of trouble at the Raleigh continued to bubble up. Earlier this year, the Raleigh\u2019s ownership hired Newmark to market the property to potential bidders. That\u2019s how Nahla entered the picture with the winning bid.\nShvo had the right of first refusal and tried to match the offer, but ultimately sold the assemblage in October, when BH3\u2019s most recent extension expired. Nahla has not yet revealed its plans for the project. Its co-founder and managing principal Genghis Hadi did not respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "Three New Buffalo homes found buyers this month in less than a week \u2014 indicating strong demand for desirable properties in the southwest Michigan resort town.\nTwo lakefront houses on Marquette Drive were listed this month asking nearly $7 million \u2014 the priciest listings this year, and among just a few lakefront listings this year.\nBoth houses are listed by Liz Roch, with @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate. She could not be reached for comment\nOne property, at 11561 Marquette Drive, was listed Oct. 2 and went into contract Oct. 5. The 5,500 square-foot house has five bedrooms and five-and-a-half bathrooms, with 100 feet of private beach frontage, according to the listing.\nAnother, at\n11869 Marquette Drive\n\u2014 the house of former Illinois Republican House Speaker Lee Daniels \u2014 went on the market Oct. 16 and went into contract Oct. 22. The nearly 5,000-square-foot house has five bedrooms and five-and-a-half bathrooms.\nThe record sale in New Buffalo was for an off-market deal for $8.5 million in 2023. Earlier this year, DRW Holdings founder and CEO\nsold his mansion in nearby Union Pier\nfor $7 million, the highest publicly listed sale in the area in recent years.\nMoving further inland, a house at 50111 Deer Park Drive priced at $4.4 million found a buyer just a few days after hitting the market on Oct. 15. The property\u2019s listing agent, Jan Smith of @properties, said the first person to tour the house went under contract within 48 hours.\n\u201cThis is usually a pretty quiet time of the year, and there\u2019s been quite a bit of activity of late,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI think people are trying to lock down spring-summer 2026 now as opposed to waiting.\u201d\n\nNew Buffalo is a popular second-home destination for\nChicago buyers\n. Smith said many of the buyers she encounters are from the city, looking for a nearby vacation home.\nThe two lakefront properties were rarities in New Buffalo, where lakefront listings have been sparse. One beach house sold for $2.4 million in August, finding a buyer in about a week. A couple other lakefront houses are listed at around $4 million, but none have approached the $7 million price tag on both Marquette Drive properties.\nNot everything in the town\nis moving. One inland house priced at nearly $4.9 million has been on the market since March 2024, and has been listed a few times without selling since 2021. Another Marquette Drive lakefront house has been listed on and off since September 2024 without finding a buyer.\nSmith said the properties that landed buyers quickly this month were all turnkey and up-to-date, which elevated interest.\n\u201cThis speaks to the properties that just went under contract, their condition,\u201d Smith said. \u201cA lot of times these properties haven\u2019t traded for many years and require a lot of work.\u201d\nDemand for property in New Buffalo has also moved inland recently, according to Smith. She said she\u2019s seeing more properties listed north of $4 million off the lake than she has in the past.\n\u201cThis is a very small area, so there just isn\u2019t very much inventory,\u201d Smith said. \u201cSo when something good comes up, there\u2019s an audience and someone\u2019s going to snap it up.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A proposed San Antonio-area development is exposing the\ncity\u2019s growth dilemma\n: how to build fast enough to meet\nhousing demand\nwithout poisoning the water supply.\nLennar Homes\u2019 Guajolote Ranch, a 2,900-home project near Scenic Loop Road in northwest Bexar County, secured a key wastewater permit despite fierce local opposition, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe permit from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality allows discharge of up to 1 million gallons daily into Helotes Creek, a tributary that feeds the Edwards Aquifer, which is a drinking water source for more than 2.5 million people across 13 counties, according to the Edwards Aquifer Authority.\nCritics fear contamination, noting the aquifer\u2019s porous limestone makes it highly susceptible, and runoff from sprawling subdivisions could accelerate pollution and erosion. Former UTSA professor and geologist Stuart Birnbaum called TCEQ\u2019s focus on limited contaminants \u201cblinders.\u201d\nTCEQ\u2019s decision sparked a backlash from the Scenic Loop\u2013Helotes Creek Alliance, which is backed by 15,000 letters from residents and lawmakers opposing the development.\nGuajolote Ranch has also become a flashpoint for affordable housing concerns. Even though San Antonio stands to face a 70,000-unit housing shortage by 2030, the homes in the community, expected to list between $300,000 and $700,000, will be unaffordable for many San Antonio residents, 30 percent of whom are below the poverty line.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand why a seventh project is essential,\u201d alliance chair Randy Neumann told the outlet, pointing to\nslow sales\nand discounts at Lennar\u2019s nearby subdivisions.\nLennar\u2019s plan for Guajolote Ranch includes 50 percent open space and a public improvement district. It\u2019s seeking $138 million in bonds to fund roads and utilities, which will cost homeowners more than $1,000 annually. County commissioners and the City Council are expected to vote on the PID this fall.\nDespite a\nsoftening market\n, Lennar is pressing ahead, issuing new bid solicitations through Pape-Dawson Engineers in October. Company officials didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nDevelopers argue that rising construction costs and scarce land closer to the city make projects like Guajolote inevitable. But environmentalists counter that each approval weakens protections for the Hill Country\u2019s fragile ecosystems.\n\u201cApproval here sets a precedent,\u201d Birnbaum said, warning that adjacent Medina and Kendall counties could be next.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

She has had a long-time friendship with the mayor, with the two often popping up at each other\u2019s events or in photographs together. In July, Srugo\nlaunched\na PAC to support Adams\u2019 re-election bid, which he ended last month.\nLike much of the city\u2019s real estate community, she has also been outspoken in her opposition to a Mamdani mayoralty. On a recent radio appearance, she offered a blunt assessment: \u201cI think he\u2019s a total loser.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A group of homeowners on North Bay Road, one of Miami Beach\u2019s priciest streets, are pushing a plan to install security gates as a result of a string of auto thefts and increased traffic.\nThe street is home to celebrities and some of the city\u2019s wealthiest residents, including Mickey Drexler,\nCindy Crawford and Rande Gerber\n, Joshua Kushner and Karlie Kloss,\nDavid and Victoria Beckham\nand Barry Gibb.\nAbout eight or nine car thefts have occurred on North Bay Road in each of the past four years, compared with 14 in 2020, the\nWall Street Journal\nreported. Miami Beach Police Department spokesperson Chris Bess said they are related to a nationwide organized crime ring. In many cases, residents left their keys in the car with the engine on, or left their cars unlocked.\nThe Journal reported that two people jumped the fence surrounding developer\nMichael Stern\n\u2019s waterfront mansion and tried to steal his Maybach. Stern was not in the car; his private security, a former New York City police officer, was sitting in the front seat with the engine idling.\n\nCritics of the proposal to install security gates view it as an effort by wealthy residents to isolate themselves from the rest of Miami Beach, even if it means redirecting traffic onto their neighbors on Alton Road, and limiting how residents in other neighborhoods like Alton can access their homes. Some also say that walling off a portion of the street is a veiled attempt to\nraise property values.\nColdwell Banker\u2019s Danny Hertzberg, of the Jills Zeder Group, estimated that property values could rise up to 20 percent if gates are installed.\nNorth Bay Road residents in the middle section collected signatures from at least 10 percent of their households to move forward with the process to create a special taxation district. If the Miami Beach Commission approves the proposal, 50 percent of homeowners would have to vote in favor of gating off their neighborhood. The plan would also require Miami-Dade County\u2019s approval. The gates could cost between $200,000 and $300,000, which would be paid for via taxes imposed on those homeowners.\n\u2014 Katherine Kallergis",

        "content": "The\nElon Musk-fueled\nspate of development coming to Bastrop has political leaders of the Central Texas town wondering if it still needs an economic development corporation.\nCity officials in the fast-growing town 30 miles east of Austin are considering a ballot measure to dissolve the Bastrop Economic Development Corporation, signaling a dramatic shift in how the city approaches growth and business incentives, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nCity Council and the EDC board met Oct. 21 and directed staff to craft a dissolution plan for voter consideration in November of next year. The move reflects mounting skepticism about the EDC\u2019s usefulness at a time when Bastrop has become a magnet for major employers without needing the kind of subsidies or tax incentives that once defined the city\u2019s strategy.\nBastrop is home to facilities for\nMusk\u2019s Boring Company and SpaceX\nand has gotten the attention of the film industry with actor\nZachary Levi launching a $100 million campus\nin the town for the filming of \u201cnon-woke movies.\u201d Development activity has also spurred\nmultifamily projects\n; plus, the city is weighing a\n390-acre mixed-use development\nthat would include a convention center, hospital and hotel.\n\u201cOnce upon a time, Bastrop created the EDC and set this tax up because we were a sleepy little town,\u201d Mayor Pro Tem John Kirkland said during the meeting. \u201cWe\u2019re no longer that. We\u2019re a destination for businesses.\u201d\nBastrop established its EDC in 1995, funded by a portion of local sales taxes. After years of tension over spending priorities, voters slashed the EDC\u2019s funding by 75 percent last year, redirecting most of the revenue to road improvements. The agency now receives just one-eighth of a cent of sales tax, or about $1.1 million annually, compared with $3.3 million going to infrastructure.\n\nCity Manager Sylvia Carrillo-Trevino, who also serves as the EDC\u2019s interim executive director, said the organization has long suffered from limited authority and friction with past councils. The EDC can\u2019t act independently on incentives or land purchases, requiring council sign-off \u2014 a dynamic some officials described as a \u201cparent-child relationship.\u201d\nSupporters of dissolution argue the city can still offer targeted incentives without the EDC, freeing up funds for community projects like park upgrades, downtown infrastructure and affordable housing. Officials have floated ideas ranging from a $10 million arena renovation and downtown parking garage to new partnerships with local colleges. Another option under consideration: diverting the sales tax to a crime control district that could fund five or six new police officers.\nThe EDC still has about $5 million in outstanding obligations, including $2 million owed to Acutronic USA under a prior incentive deal, which would have to be addressed before winding down.\nMayor Ishmael Harris cautioned against sending the wrong message, saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to give the impression that we\u2019re not trying to have businesses come here.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The week in New York City, real estate was all about trouble: who\u2019s been in it before, who\u2019s in it today and how to avoid it in the future.\nFor Eli Karp, trouble arose this week. Madison Realty Capital\ntook over\nhis Flatbush property at 1580 Nostrand Avenue with a $70 million credit bid, where Karp once planned a sprawling two-building development called\nHello Nostrand\non the site.\nKarp\u2019s Hello Living bought the site for $13 million in 2014 touting plans to build a luxury apartment complex. As soon as construction started, however, he ran into trouble with lenders.\nHe put the property into\nbankruptcy\nin 2021, a day before senior lender\nMadison Realty Capital\ncould launch a UCC foreclosure process. Madison sold a $6 million mezzanine loan and $73 million senior loan on the property to another firm, Arch Companies, which proceeded to sue Karp to initiate another foreclosure on the property.\nHe has only finished one of the buildings, a 93-unit rental which was auctioned off in June alongside the undeveloped property. The once-rising star also lost 2417 Albemarle Road to his lender in a credit bid via auction.\nWrecking crew\nDemolition company Alba Services confronted issues from its past.\nThe nonunion subcontractor agreed to pay\n$1.5 million to settle\nclaims that it flouted New York\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation laws, retaliated against injured workers and failed to address reports of sexual harassment.\nAlba allegedly failed to report hundreds of workplace injuries between 2016 and 2024, allowing the company to lower its insurance costs. The company also threatened employees who tried filing workers\u2019 compensation claims.\nThe settlement was announced by the New York Attorney General\u2019s office, but the ball started rolling when the laborers\u2019 union, Local 79, launched a public\ncampaign\nagainst the firm in 2022, accusing it of offering rewards for information on employees who filed \u201cfalse\u201d workers\u2019 compensation claims as a means of intimidation.\nAs part of the settlement, the company will be overseen by the attorney general\u2019s office for at least three years and is required to file biannual reports showing compliance with workers\u2019 compensation and human rights laws.\n\nLitigation concerns are nothing new for Alba. In 2023, it was one of 26 companies\nindicted\nin a wide-ranging construction kickback scheme; Alba received $2.8 million in inflated contracts and change orders at 250 Fifth Avenue and 189 Bowery, according to the indictment.\nThe wolf\u2019s den\nTrouble used to dog Jordan Belfort \u2014 the inspiration of Martin Scorsese\u2019s Oscar-winning \u201cWolf of Wall Street.\u201d While he\u2019s looking to turn over a new leaf as a motivational speaker, anything connected to the disgraced former stockbroker and convicted felon will continue to grab headlines.\nHis former Long Island mansion at 5 Pin Oak Court in Glen Head\nfound a buyer at a $6.9 million\nprice point. lived in the 8,700-square-foot home with his wife, Nadine Macaluso, during the height of his career in the 1990s.\nThe feds took Belfort\u2019s home in 2001, two years after his conviction of securities fraud and prior to a two-year stint in federal prison. So much for \u201cnot f*king leaving,\u201d in the words of Leonardo DiCaprio, who played Belfort in the film.\nBelfort pivoted his life and moved west, buying an oceanfront home in Hermosa Beach in California, but has since apparently relocated to Miami during the pandemic.\nReboot\nSpeaking of pivots, Richard Coles and Gary Tischler\u2019s Vanbarton Group are becoming masters of office-to-residential conversions. This week, the company\nlanded a $280 million loan\nfrom Invesco to refinance a 455-unit building at 980 Sixth Avenue.\nThe loan replaces a $273 million one from Blackstone\u2019s mortgage trust. Vanbarton went seeking the permanent financing after converting WeWork\u2019s former three floors into 77 market-rate apartments.\nThe firm is one of the most\nactive office-to-residential converters\nin the city with a pipeline exceeding 2,000 units.\nYour move,\nNathan Berman\n.\n",

        "content": "The city has seen a spate of announcements for new sauna and spa concepts.\nThe most recent is Lore, a so-called \u201cbathing club\u201d in Noho that opened last month.\nAt the same time, Othership, whose Flatiron location offers both classes and raves, opened its Williamsburg location.\nWilliamsburg\u2019s Bathhouse, where the pools are heated by crypto mining and its lawyers have assured the public the water is\nNOT giving people UTIs\n, opened its Flatiron location last year.\nNot to be outdone, Kith Ivy, a padel club from the streetwear brand, plans to nestle a cold plunge, sauna and jacuzzi between the Erewhon tonic bar and the Giorgio Armani-branded locker room.\nRemedy Place, which bills itself as a \u201csocial wellness club,\u201d started in West Hollywood but opened its third location in Soho in November.\nFinally, sauna concept Saint is planning to open this fall in MAG Partners\u2019 residential building Ruby on West 29th Street.\nTo be sure, Manhattan had its fair share of saunas before this most recent wave: Koreatown\u2019s many spas, the Russian and Turkish Baths, your everyday Equinox locker room.\nAnd before that, there were gay bathhouses, although most of those were closed by the city in the 1980s in a controversial attempt to stem the spread of HIV.\nBut these new sauna concepts seem to be trying to do something slightly different: marketing these locations as a place to socialize. This is a reversal of the more traditional sauna etiquette, which calls for only quiet conversations.\nThe thinking is that people want a place to meet others that\u2019s not drinking or on their phones. Why not in a bathing suit, dripping in sweat?\nAt Othership, there are group sauna classes to facilitate that connection.\n\u201cRegardless of how long you stay in that ice bath, you\u2019re doing it with people you\u2019ve never met before,\u201d said Cassie Durand, an executive vice president at CBRE who is working with Othership expansion locations. \u201cYou\u2019re instantly connected, you instantly feel a sense of accomplishment that\u2019s a shared activity.\u201d\nLore has also tried to play up its role as a potential \u201cthird space.\u201d At Remedy Place and Kith Ivy, a social club is baked into the offering.\n(The exception here is Saint, which offers private sauna \u201cstudios,\u201d explaining, \u201cIn a time of \u2018social saunas,\u2019 we hope to offer something else: quiet moments of solitude.\u201d)\nThe interest in saunas and cold plunges appears to be national, Durand said. Home saunas are taking off among the nation\u2019s higher-dollar homebuyers, the New York Times\nreported\n. So it makes sense that New Yorkers, used to apartment living, would turn to more public options.\n\nAnd there has been broader interest citywide in boutique health and wellness, as the Real Estate Board of New York noted in a recent retail report.\n\u201cIt illustrates how formative COVID was in terms of awareness of self-care and mental well-being,\u201d said Keith DeCoster, vice president of research at REBNY.\nHowever, there are hurdles to building these sauna and cold plunge locations from a real estate perspective.\n\u201cYou\u2019re dealing with small pools, tons of power, just objectively challenging infrastructure requirements combined with code,\u201d Durand said. Part of the reason these businesses, including Othership, cluster in Flatiron, she said, is that the area pulls in the residential, office and tourism markets.\nSo, come on in \u2014 the water\u2019s freezing.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nPrivate equity owners have been getting into New York\u2019s multifamily market for a little while now. But what are they like as landlords? Well-capitalized stewards? Neglectful bad actors? Drop me a line:\nlilah.burke@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nYou can incorporate a sign as a commercial condo unit, as illustrated by the $12 million sale of a Times Square billboard this week. Vornado previously nabbed a $407 million loan in part secured by a\nsix-story billboard\non the Marriott Marquis.\nElsewhere\n\u2014 House Minority Leader and Brooklyn voter Hakeem Jeffries has offered Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani a last-minute endorsement. \u201cZohran Mamdani has relentlessly focused on addressing the affordability crisis and explicitly committed to being a Mayor for all New Yorkers, including those who do not support his candidacy,\u201d Jeffries said in a statement.\n\u2014 New York State Attorney General Letitia James pled not guilty today on charges of mortgage fraud, Politico\nreported\n.\n\u2014 The city\u2019s new 15 mph speed limit on e-bikes goes into effect today. Devotees of CitiBike\u2019s \u201cWhite Stallion\u201d e-bike are not pleased, the\nTimes\nreported.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$36 million\nfor 10 East 67th Street. The Lenox Hill mansion is 13,000 square feet. It last sold on-market for $28.5 million in 2006.\nSerhant\u2019s\nMelissa Post and Ryan Serhant have the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$6.1 million\nfor 96 South 9th Street. The Williamsburg church is three stories and 3,400 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $5.8 million for 720 West End Avenue, Unit 11C. The Upper West Side condo is a new development and 2,300 square feet.\nCorcoran Sunshine Marketing Group\nhas the listing.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

The seller was an LLC tied to hedge fund manager\nJoseph DiMenna\n. Dating to 1881, the Gilded Age mansion stands seven stories tall and spans 13,000 square feet. The buyer was an LLC. The mansion has seven bedrooms, 13 bathrooms, an elevator, seven wood-burning fireplaces and a 1,700-square-foot rooftop deck.

An LLC tied to\nMichael Weitzman\u2019s Double U Development\n, based in Brooklyn, offloaded what appears to be a development site at\n96 South Ninth Street\n, which at the moment is home to a church, for $6.1 million. The buyer was\nGolden Cedar Realty LLC.\nThe site previously traded in 2022 for $14.1 million.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nDinakar Singh\n, the CEO of Axon Capital, purchased a sponsor unit at\n50 United Nations Plaza\n, which was developed by\nZeckendorf Development\nand\nGlobal Holdings Inc.

Corcoran sold the co-op to a trust for $13.5 million. The 11-room duplex also has a space for staff and a terrace.

Still, the index is down six points annually, according to the data released earlier this month.\nThe long-running monthly index,\npublished by the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) and Wells Fargo\n, indicates how much confidence builders have in the single-family housing market as measured on a scale of zero to 100. Anything below 50 means most builders have a glass-half-empty outlook.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

        "content": "A Gilded Age mansion on the Upper East Side just traded for a steep discount.\nAn entity tied to hedge fund manager Joseph DiMenna sold the historic townhouse at 10 East 67th Street for $36 million, down significantly from its initial asking price of $50 million, according to public records.\nThe buyer, whose identity is shielded by an LLC, paid roughly $2,800 per square foot for the seven-story home, known as the Jules Bache Mansion. It has seven bedrooms and 10 bathrooms and features an elevator, garden and 1,700-square-foot rooftop deck.\nDiMenna and his now ex-wife, producer Diana, bought the sprawling 13,000-square-foot abode in 2006 for $28.5 million from Jeanne Andlinger, the wife of the late investment banker Gerhard Andlinger. Andlinger appears to have inherited the home in 2003 from the estate of the late art collector and socialite Catarina \u201cKitty\u201d Meyer.\nMeyer died at the home in 1997 after an electrical fire blazed through it in the early hours of the morning and trapped her and her guest, actress and socialite Zohra Lahrizi Zondler, on a balcony on the fifth floor, the\nNew York Times\nreported at the time.\n\nAfter the fire broke out, Meyer ran upstairs to rescue Zondler, but the two women weren\u2019t able to get back downstairs. Both Meyer and Zondler died after jumping from the balcony.\nThe home was gut-renovated after the fire, including a new chef\u2019s kitchen and solarium, according to\nMansion Global\n. The architect, Peter Marino, maintained the original staircase and portions of the formal dining room.\nThe DiMennas listed the property last February, three months before the couple filed for divorce in New York. The home hit the market with a $50 million asking price, though it later dropped to $45 million when Ryan Serhant and Serhant\u2019s Melissa Post took over the listing from Douglas Elliman earlier this year.\nThe deal follows a string of contract signings for notable Upper East Side mansions, including Bill Cosby\u2019s 13,000-square-foot home at\n18 East 71st Street\n, asking $29 million. The disgraced actor landed an inked deal for his townhouse earlier this month as the property faced foreclosure.\nBarbara Streisand also found a buyer for her home at\n49 East 80th Street\nin August. The eight-bedroom townhouse last asked $16 million.\n",

It will be located on an 8.5-acre site that\u2019s part of 17 acres Mangat owns. The project is making its way through the\ndesign review process\nnow.\nThe site will include 36 units in five buildings totaling more than 84,000 square feet. Interested buyers can purchase units at pre-sale now with options ranging from $325 to $350 per square foot. Owners can opt for either shell delivery or spec offices catering to industries like manufacturing, warehousing and distribution.\n\nThe industrial condos are designed with small to midsize businesses in mind. Units at MG Business Park units are listed for sale by Brett Ranta and Jordan Tennant with Scottsdale-based Orion Investment Real Estate.\nMangat\u2019s adjacent 9 acres could also be developed at some point in the future, though details on what that could be remain light.\nConstruction is slated to begin at the end of March with the industrial condos expected to be available by the end of next year.\nIn total, Mangat Group owns about 1,000 acres in Greater Phoenix. Besides the MG Business Park, Mangat also plans to build a sports complex in Glendale with soccer and field hockey facilities; that project is in its early stages.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The 28,800-square-foot property is home to Chanel, Moncler, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels and Le Colonial, and represents one of the premier trophy assets on the city\u2019s Gold Coast shopping corridor, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nUnion paid $120 million for the property in 2021 \u2014 the highest price for a Chicago retail building since 2016 \u2014 marking one of the most expensive single-asset retail deals of the past decade. The company declined to comment on why it\u2019s selling or what it expects to fetch, but the move could be an early test of investor appetite for high-end retail after two years of muted transaction activity driven by higher interest rates and economic uncertainty.\nThe offering is rare for Oak Street, where turnover is infrequent and tenants skew ultra-luxury. Recent trades include the roughly $17 million sale of a\nBottega Veneta\n\u2013leased property late last year and\nRazny Jewelers\u2019\n$16.4 million purchase of 107 East Oak in February.\nBuilt in 2018, Union\u2019s property is among the newest on the street and one of its few modern multi-tenant buildings.\n\n\u201c65 East Oak epitomizes best-in-class construction, elite tenancy and stands as one of the most coveted luxury retail assets in the nation,\u201d Newmark Senior Managing Director Keely\nPolczynski\ntold the outlet. She is marketing the listing.\nPolczynski described Oak Street as among the top five highest-rent retail corridors across the country, often compared to Fifth Avenue in New York and Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills.\nOak Street has bucked broader retail trends in recent years. While other downtown Chicago corridors \u2014 including the Magnificent Mile \u2014 continue to grapple with vacancies and rent stagnation, Oak Street remains near full occupancy. It\u2019s also lured a new wave of tenants such as\nFrench handbag brand Pol\u00e8ne\nand Lugano Diamonds, which both opened boutiques there in the past year.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "55 Hawthorne Street appears to be headed to foreclosure.\nLenders are seeking to foreclose on the property and place it into receivership, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. A lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court alleges that an affiliate of\nLos Angeles-based CIM Group\ndefaulted on a $61.5 million loan backed by the property after failing to make its monthly payments since the beginning of August.\nThe loan was placed into special servicing in July. Yelp\u2019s lease of the entire 136,432-square-foot building was set to expire that month.\nAt the time, commercial mortgage-backed securities bondholders learned that \u201cimminent default\u201d was the reason for the loan transfer to a special servicer. Earlier this month, notes confirmed the servicer is gathering information about the building while figuring out \u201cworkout strategies deemed appropriate to achieve the highest net present value recovery.\u201d\n\nIf lenders are successful in the\nforeclosure seizure\n, they could sell the building and use the proceeds to recover some or all of the delinquent $61.5 million loan.\nYelp has been a tenant at 55 Hawthorne since 2014 and has been subleasing out some of its space in the building since before the pandemic. After COVID hit, the company listed its entire footprint at 55 Hawthorne for sublease. Over the past decade,\nYelp subleased its space\nto companies like NerdWallet and Motive, though notes sent to bondholders in July said most of the subtenants were expected to leave the building after Yelp\u2019s master lease expired July 31.\nCIM listed the property for sale\nin the spring of 2024, purportedly out of fear for the building\u2019s value once Yelp left, though no deal was ever signed. CIM acquired the property in 2016 for $123 million, or $900 per square foot; its listing price last year wasn\u2019t disclosed. The company was\nseeking lease tenants\nthis summer as it faced a massive clearing-out of space.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Dirt took the spotlight this week.\nHigh-rises and arenas got plenty of lines in the week\u2019s drama,\nwith foreclosures rattling Uptown\nand San Antonio considering a hefty\ninvestment in a home for the Spurs\n, but the main character was land.\nFirst, came news that\nconstruction is underway\non an empty lot with a rich history in Houston\u2019s gayborhood. Southeastern Company is building a mid-rise apartment project on the grave of \u201c\nDisco Kroger\n,\u201d the Montrose grocery store where drag queens and partygoers would wrap up a night out, thanks to its 24-hour schedule and proximity to the neighborhood\u2019s LGBTQ bars and clubs. The iconic store was closed and demolished in 2021.\nWhether or not new development is blanching the funky soul of Houston, Fort Worth is counting on it to infuse life into\nPanther Island\n, a flood mitigation project decades in the making that\u2019s expected to create a vibrant mixed-use development on the Trinity River. The Tarrant Regional Water District is vetting developers for the land, over 30 acres of which can accommodate buildings. The Fort Worth City Council recently approved heightened density for the project, establishing minimum height requirements for 15 acres of the project.\nMeanwhile, unlikely neighbors\nSpaceX and Cards Against Humanity settled\na quirky tiff over a plot of land at the Texas-Mexico border. The irreverent card game maker claimed Elon Musk\u2019s company, located at nearby Starbase, dumped trash on the land it bought in protest of the border wall in 2017. The pair settled for undisclosed terms last month.\nUptown Dallas\nDallas has historically grown north. Lately, it\u2019s also been shrinking from the south. Local companies and out-of-state transplants alike have long favored Uptown, a neighborhood north of downtown known for its walkability and liveliness. Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Deloitte are just a few of the firms with plans to ditch Downtown Dallas\u2019 blocky \u201980s high-rises in favor of Uptown\u2019s trails and trolley line.\nHowever, despite these indications of demand, Uptown office landlord\nHarwood International\nis struggling to stabilize assets in its namesake neighborhood, Harwood District.\nGabriel Barbier-Mueller\u2019s firm has\nquietly offloaded four office properties\nto San Francisco-based hedge fund TPG, the same firm that\u2019s supposedly financing Harwood\u2019s latest project, Harwood No. 15.\n\nNews of the trades come as Harwood faces its\nthird office foreclosure\nthis year. Harwood No. 1 at 2651 North Harwood Street, the company\u2019s first office development, is scheduled to be auctioned next month, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service. The $37.45 million debt on the building amounts to $355 per square foot.\nHarwood\u2019s issues are isolated to its 30-acre district. The Uptown office submarket still has some of the lowest vacancy rates and highest rental rates of the Dallas-Fort Worth office market.\nSpurs vs. Mavs\nThe San Antonio Spurs trounced the Dallas Mavericks this week, and they may win the race to a new arena to boot. But first they\u2019ll need the backing of voters.\nAs part of Project Marvel, the $4 billion redevelopment project aimed at transforming downtown San Antonio, local leaders plan to build a new arena for the Spurs. On Election Day, voters have the opportunity to weigh in on\ntwo ballot measures\nto fund the project.\nProposition A would authorize the county to collect $192 million for the redevelopment of Frost Bank Center and Freeman Coliseum into a stock show and rodeo district. If Proposition B passes, the county can collect $311 million for the new arena.\nPolls show\nmiddling support for the measures\na few weeks before the election. A survey from the University of Texas at San Antonio\u2019s Center for Public Opinion Research\u00a0 found that 44 percent of voters back Proposition A, and nearly 40 percent support Proposition B.\nCritics of Project Marvel, including\nnewly elected Mayor Gina Ortiz\n, want to make sure the Spurs foot enough of the bill. Beyond the venue tax, the city plans to chip in $489 million, and the Spurs plan to contribute $500 million.\nMeanwhile, the Mavs announced earlier this year that they\u2019d like to get out of the house that Dirk built. American Airlines Center is the last professional sports venue in Dallas proper, and the prospect of losing the team to a suburb like Irving or Frisco is rankling some locals. The city has teased a different centrally located site: City Hall, a brutalist landmark designed by I.M. Pei and made famous in Robocop. The aging building has racked up a costly bill of deferred maintenance, and the\nCity of Dallas is considering selling it\nand redeveloping it into a new arena.\n",

        "content": "Fame, but no fortune?\nI recently wrote about two pieces of real estate that once upon a time each had a moment in the sun: A beachfront mixed-use property that was home to Snapchat and synonymous with the social media company\u2019s rise, and an apartment building that was featured on the Eagles\u2019 Hotel California album back cover.\nThe former\nsold\n, but for less than its prior purchase price and only after a struggle to lease it.\nThe latter is now scheduled for a\nforeclosure auction\n, with San Francisco multifamily stalwart Neveo Mosser and his Mosser Capital owing $29.4 million. A notice of default went out before an auction for the apartments at 6500 Yucca Street was scheduled for October 28.\nMaybe it wasn\u2019t such a lovely place after all \u2014 the refrain from the Eagles\u2019 title track notwithstanding \u2014 or maybe the pending auction says more about Mosser\u2019s troubles.\nMosser Companies early last year, defaulted on an $88 million loan tied to 12 apartment buildings throughout San Francisco.\nOh, Snap!\nMeanwhile, the pair of three-story oceanfront buildings in Venice, home to Snapchat when it was headquartered in the Silicon Beach neighborhood, sold for $30.7 million. The 10 live-work lofts and ground-floor retail at 619 and 701 Ocean Front Walk were purchased by Stefan Ashkenazy, who owns the Petit Ermitage, a boutique hotel in West Hollywood.\nThe seller, DLJ Real Estate Capital Partners, purchased the property for $40.5 million in 2014. When Snapchat consolidated its Silicon Beach office footprint in Santa Monica, it left a glut in the office market of funky Venice.\nLaeroc won\u2019t lay down\nLaeroc Partners isn\u2019t going down without a fight.\nCathay Bank\nsued\nthe company, claiming it defaulted on a $31 million loan. The lender requested a foreclosure on the loan, and that a receiver be appointed for the office and data-center property at 530 West 6th Street.\nLaeroc Partners not only denied all allegations but asked that the complaint be dismissed with prejudice, with Cathay Bank covering all legal costs.\n\nThe court documents were signed by Kim Benjamin, president of Laeroc Partners.\nAttorneys representing Cathay Bank and Laeroc Partners did not respond to a request for comment.\nHello, BANC\nIn more downtown news, Banc of California,\ninked\nan 11-year lease for 40,000 square feet at 865 South Figueroa Street \u2014 and now its name will loom 35 stories over the cityscape, thanks to the naming rights that came with the deal.\nSo say goodbye to the TCW logo, and try not to call it the TCW Tower because the asset management company left two years ago.\nAnd please know that I know that not every naming deal lives up to its name \u2014 this is the same Banc of California that\nsigned\na $100 million pact to put its name on the Los Angeles Football Club stadium in Exposition Park but pulled out of the deal four years later.\nEY Plaza, again\nIn the last column, I relayed that EY Plaza had taken another\nvalue haircut\n, this time by a relatively small 10 percent to $135 million. Prior cuts have been steeper, after all, from a highwater valuation of $446 million before the pandemic took full hold.\nNow it\u2019s getting around time to see if the cuts will come on the $275 million note connected to the distressed office tower that Colliers plans to peddle at a discount.\nColliers said it \u201cwill be calling for offers on Tuesday, October 28,\u201d declining to share any further information on whether the brokerage has seen any interest thus far.\nIf you aren\u2019t up to speed on all things EY Plaza, here\u2019s a catch-up in 10 seconds or less: It\u2019s a 41-story office building at 725 South Figueroa that was owned by Brookfield before the company ceded control to a receiver after defaulting on hundreds of millions of commercial mortgage-backed securities debt. One deal for the tower has fallen through.\n",

        "content": "The Bay Area might be home of the Smeeze, and this might be the season for the Monster Mash, but San Francisco saw major higher education players this week bring their own, surprising moves to the dance floor.\nThe Wharton School of Business, the Philadelphia-based wing of the University of Pennsylvania that educated President Donald Trump, is now renting from him. Wharton is shuffling its San Francisco campus into the city\u2019s Financial District, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The Ivy League school\u2019s masters of business administration program has held a presence in San Francisco for 25 years, and\nplans to begin its next chapter at 345 Montgomery St, in a building known as The Cube\n.\nThe striking, 80,000-square-foot building is part of the larger Bank of America Center, which is owned by Vornado Realty Trust and the Trump Organization, according to the Chronicle. As part of the shuffle, Wharton plans to vacate its current campus at 2 Harrison St., where it shares a building with Google.\nA mile south, the tango between San Francisco and Vanderbilt University appears to be heating up. The Chronicle last week reported that the dons of the Nashville-based school\nhave set their sights on Fifth and Mission\n, home of the newspaper\u2019s own headquarters and the 5M mixed-use development.\nSan Francisco civic leaders have long discussed resuscitating the city\u2019s downtown from its pandemic pains with an increased presence of higher learning institutions\u2013but they can\u2019t count on the homegrown Academy of Art University to follow the same beat.\nThe private, for-profit university is\nreportedly looking to sell off 10 of its properties in the city\u2019s urban core\n.\nEven if you take higher education out of the mix, the city\u2019s real estate markets have enjoyed a recent surge thanks to artificial intelligence, which has\nrents a\u2019soaring\nand\noffices a\u2019leasing\n.\nThe hi-tech rush for the office sector has largely been a flight to quality, however, boosting Class A office buildings but leaving questions for some of the city\u2019s older stock.\nThe Newhall Building stands as a severe example. Built in 1908, the 12-story, Lewis Parsons Hobart-designed building at 260 California Street, was appraised in 2015 at $32 million. Today, it\u2019s worth $13 million,\na 60% drop in value\n.\n\nThe property owner, Swift Realty Partners, owes about $17 million on the loan it took out to purchase the building a decade ago. The address recently lost Google as a tenant, despite the tech giant signing onto major leases elsewhere in the city. And Citibank, another of the building\u2019s major tenants, will vacate the space early next year as it prepares to occupy a shiny new space in the Financial District.\nOlder office buildings bottoming out in value has the potential to bring pain upon lenders and landlords alike. But it may also bring a rare opportunity, according to the authors of a report published last month.\nLed by the Milan-based architecture firm OBR,\n\u201cRevitalizing Downtown San Francisco Through Architecture\u201d\nis a collaborative, multinational effort between design and real estate firms San Francisco and Italy that hits upon an oft-mused topic in urban planning: adaptive re-use.\nBrett Terpeluk and Valerie Beauchamp, of the participating Studio Terpeluk, argue that landowners have \u201cnot yet felt the full impact of the staggering 37% commercial vacancy rate,\u201d and that the only clear response is to convert offices into housing.\nAdaptive reuse has been long-discussed but rarely pursued due to complexity and cost of making offices suitable for living. However, Terpeluk argues the pandemic\u2019s paradigm shift for office space offers the perfect opportunity.\n\u201cIt is time to re-examine the enormous potential of infrastructural reuse, from environmental, urban, and economic perspectives,\u201d the authors write. \u201cWe are at a pivotal moment of change.\u201d\nOver in Oakland, the reality of San Francisco\u2019s residential surge has caught the attention of one major East Bay developer. Signature Development founder Michael Ghielmetti has been at work on the Brooklyn Basin since 2001, breaking ground in 2014, and delivering roughly 1,700 housing units along Oakland\u2019s waterfront since then.\nHe told The Real Deal that he is transitioning the 371-unit Caspian apartment building into condos, ranging from $349,000 to $799,000.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing San Francisco really coming out hot, and I think it\u2019s six to 12 months ahead of Oakland, because that\u2019s typically been the pattern,\u201d Ghielmetti said. \u201cTypically San Francisco gets to price points that are more challenging, whether you\u2019re an office tenant or \u2026 a residential renter, and you start to get priced out. And then you have choices, where do you go? Marin County isn\u2019t cheaper. The Peninsula is not cheaper. So, historically, people have come to the East Bay.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s rise to the top of the multifamily market is dominating the metro\u2019s real estate narratives.\nHere\u2019s a chapter on the risks of running hot, which include political ramifications as demand overwhelms a diminished pipeline of supply and sends rents skyrocketing.\nChicago\u2019s job base is stabilizing, migration is rebounding and\ntenants are paying up\nfor quality units. A key constraint, however, is self-inflicted: a mix of political paralysis, fiscal unpredictability and residents who protest density but complain about rent hikes.\nThat combination is\nexporting capital to collar counties\nand locking out the very housing the city needs most.\nAll politics are local, it\u2019s often said, but the mixed bag of the Chicago metro\u2019s multifamily market could go beyond how the legion of renters vote in elections for city councils that control zoning decisions, enough to become a factor in the March primary race for assessor.\nThat\u2019s a battle that already has the real estate industry paying attention, for obvious reasons and then some.\nIncumbent\nAssessor Fritz Kaegi\nis fielding a challenge from\nPatrick Hynes\n, who\u2019s garnering financial support from some big business players \u2014 with a $25,000 donation from Michael Sacks of massive asset manager\nGCM Grosvenor\nleading the way, public records show.\nReal estate power figures have followed suit: Hynes took in a $10,000 donation from\nDavid Carlins of developer Magellan\nand four-figure sums from developer\nJohn O\u2019Donnell\n, investor and commercial window magnate\nRodrigo d\u2019Escoto\nand landlord\nStuart Handler\u2019s firm TLC Management\n. Bill Silverstein of Beal Properties, who bought a\nLincoln Park property for $36 million this month\n, also chipped in $2,500 for Hynes.\nKaegi has earned the enmity of real estate interests over his penchant for steep hikes on commercial property assessments. Although he took in $5,000 earlier this year from Bulls and White Sox owner\nJerry Reinsdorf\n, a real estate legend aside from his sports interests, the incumbent\u2019s campaign war chest has largely been self-funded over his past two election victories.\n\nThe multifamily segment of the market could constitute a separate front in the assessor\u2019s race.\nThe Chicago region now leads the nation in rent growth, a milestone fueled by a yearslong supply drought that\u2019s turning existing buildings into cash machines.\nInvestors say the market\u2019s strength masks a structural problem: an\nanti-development culture\nand political dysfunction that\u2019s keeping new supply off the board and the\ncosts of property taxes uncertain\ninside the urban core.\nThe result is a push by investors deeper into the suburbs, where property values are rising more reliably and taxes are more predictable than in Chicago. The Cook County assessor\u2019s race could easily center around this theme \u2014 and it could cut any number of ways.\nHynes has\nhammered Kaegi for jacking up assessments\non large commercial properties. Meanwhile, landlords within Chicago\u2019s city limits have to consider the suburbs as both a competitor and an option \u2014 Hander, for instance, has recently traded out Hyde Park assets in favor of buying bigger multifamily assets in the suburbs.\nThen take the\n$181 million that a pair of Aurora apartment deals\njust fetched. Sellers in both of those appeared to do well with the transactions, as their buyers Vistria Group, Standard Communities and DRA Advisors paid top dollar in a bet on steady rent growth and fewer political surprises. It\u2019s more varied in Chicago proper, though. Locally based\nOrigin Investments took a loss on its $63 million sale\nof a West Loop asset it purchased for nearly $66 million in March 2020. Meanwhile, developer\nMatt Katsaros\u2019 firm Wildwood\nscored a gain with a $40 million sale in Lakeview to Utah-based Highland Partners.\nSome developers are hedging their bets. Fulton Street Cos., best known for Fulton Market projects, is\ntaking its first swing\nin the suburbs.\nThe logic is simple: even modest infill projects face gauntlets of neighborhood pushback and aldermanic vetoes. Every\nblocked building\ntightens the market, further enriching existing owners while exacerbating the affordability squeeze.\nMeanwhile, in Cook County, the political theater continues. Kaegi\u2019s progressive crusade against commercial landlords \u2014 marketed as tax \u201cfairness\u201d \u2014 has instead produced chaos. Assessments swing wildly year to year, partly due to successful appeals by landlords to the county\u2019s\nBoard of Review\n. Nonetheless, the system deters investment and erodes underwriting confidence. Kaegi\u2019s race with Hynes could be construed by some as a referendum on whether Chicago even wants new housing.\nDespite the dysfunction, investor interest keeps flowing in. Highland Partners\u2019 Ben Frazer told\nTRD\nhis firm \u201cloves the Chicago market,\u201d praising strong job growth and demand. LRE Management\u2019s Eric Londa, who bought Origin\u2019s West Loop asset, said his New York-based firm is \u201ccomfortable with the uncertainty\u201d \u2014 a clue about how far risk premiums have stretched.",

        "content": "The Miami mayor\u2019s race is a muddled mess.\nEarly voting is in full swing for Miami\u2019s\nNov. 4 election\n, and 13 candidates are sprinting across the city to drum up support in one of the most wide-open races in more than decade.\nThe contenders feature seven relative newcomers to Miami\u2019s political scene, and six veterans of the city\u2019s cutthroat election cycles. Major players in the real estate industry are primarily lining up behind Miami city commissioner Joe Carollo and Miami-Dade County commissioner Eileen Higgins. But a few prominent developers and investors are throwing their support to ex-Miami City Manager Emilio Gonzalez, ex-Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez and former city commissioners Ken Russell and Alex Diaz de la Portilla.\nYet, Carollo, Higgins, Gonzalez, Suarez, Russell and Diaz de la Portilla have not proffered any groundbreaking initiatives on the real estate front, aside from the usual promises to increase affordable and workforce housing in a city that ranks high in terms of home prices and rental rates.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of each of their track records and positions on major real estate issues:\nHiggins, whose county commission district includes downtown Miami, Brickell and Little Havana, is resigning her seat to run for mayor. She enjoys support from a formidable swath of developers whose projects she\u2019s championed in her district, taking credit for 7,000 completed or planned affordable and workforce housing units in her district. Projects Higgins has touted include Magnus Brickell, a 465-unit mixed-income apartment building developed by the Related Group. She successfully passed legislation to speed up construction of seawalls and bulkheads on private properties, by requiring permits to be reviewed and issued within 90 days, expanding administrative approvals and providing incentives for property owners and developers who use nature-based alternatives such as mangroves.\nDespite receiving financial support from prominent real estate developers and investors, Carollo has also had run-ins with the industry. In 2022, he supported a proposal to eliminate a city incentive for projects near transit stations and stops to reduce on-site parking requirements. At the time, Carollo told the Miami Herald that the parking breaks were only beneficial to developers looking to maximize their profits. The proposal ultimately went nowhere. A year later, a Miami federal jury hit Carollo with a $63 million verdict after finding him guilty of violating the civil rights of Little Havana developers Bill Fuller and Martin Pinilla by orchestrating a code enforcement crackdown on their properties and businesses.\nGonzalez, who was city manager from 2018 to 2020, successfully sued the city to restore the November election after the Miami City Commission voted to postpone it until next year. Gonzalez has built a formidable campaign war chest despite having little support from well-known real estate titans. Still, his Mission Miami political action committee scored $20,000 in contributions from entities tied to Little Havana developers\u00a0 Bill Fuller and Martin Pinilla. A MAGA-aligned Republican who has won Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 endorsement, Gonzalez is following the governor\u2019s lead by promising to eliminate real estate property taxes on homesteaded properties.\nRussell resigned his District 2 Miami City Commission seat in 2022 after his second unsuccessful run for Congress. During his time in office, Russell was repeatedly the odd man out, as his colleagues often rejected his legislative initiatives, including his attempt to revamp Coconut Grove\u2019s city code to curtail teardowns of old homes by developers.\nSuarez, whose last win for the mayor\u2019s seat in 1997 was overturned due to voter fraud, is mounting a longshot comeback bid after a stint as county commissioner from 2011 to 2020. Aside from pointing to affordable housing projects built during his tenure at the county, Suarez backs a proposal to increase tax breaks for homesteaded properties in Miami. Suarez is also the father of the current mayor, Francis Suarez, who hasn't formally endorsed any candidates, including his dad.\nDiaz de la Portilla has garnered almost no support from the real estate industry, except for a $100,000 donation to his political action committee by Miami Beach power couple and real estate investors David and Leila Centner. Diaz de la Portilla\u2019s time on the city commission was cut short in 2023 when he was criminally charged for money laundering and bribery. The charges stemmed from contributions tied to the Centners, allegedly provided in exchange for his steering a no-bid deal for a city park to a trust managed by the couple. The Centners were not targets of the probe, and last year state prosecutors dropped the case against Diaz de la Portilla.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill\n3-D printed homes\nbecome common in South Florida? Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\nCLOSING TIME\n\nResidential:\nInvestor\nEdmond Harbour\npurchased his neighbors\u2019 teardown at 1821 West 27th Street on the Sunset Islands for $34 million. Dr. Mark Jaffe and Patricia Jaffe sold the Miami Beach property.\nCommercial:\nBoston-based TA Realty paid $193 million for the garden-style, 476-unit apartment complex at 100 Portofino Drive in Palm Beach Gardens. New York-based Blackstone sold the property to TA Realty, which had owned the property before selling it to Blackstone in 2017 for $103.6 million.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nThe 4-acre waterfront property at\n820 Jamaica Lane\nin Naples hit the market for nearly $90 million. The assemblage has 858 feet of contiguous water frontage along a deepwater canal and Naples Bay. It\u2019s listed with Michael McCumber of Waterfront Realty Group.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nDevelopers have proposed 143 projects with\n43,400 units\nunder the state\u2019s Live Local Act workforce housing legislation since its inception, research from the nonprofit Florida Housing Coalition shows. Nearly 3,200 apartments have been completed.\nElsewhere in Florida\nA Palm Beach board approved plans for a new, larger helipad at Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club, replacing the one built during his presidency and later removed in 2021, the\nPalm Beach Daily News\nreports. The new 60-foot pad will include a walkway and recessed safety lighting.\nLionel Messi signed a three-year contract with Inter Miami through 2028, as the club prepares to move into its new Miami Freedom Park stadium next year, according to\nNBC News\n.\nGov. Ron DeSantis announced nearly $1 billion in rebates for Florida customers of Progressive Auto Insurance, averaging about $300 per policyholder. DeSantis did not specify when the rebates would be distributed, but he said he hopes to arrange similar rebates with other insurers, the\nHerald-Tribune\nreports.\n\u2014 Katherine Kallergis",

        "content": "Social media dragged the buyer of multiple\nMalibu lots\nthrough the mud after the deals were first reported back in August.\nCatcalls over the would-be builder\u2019s bulk buys, and mistaken presumptions of the\nethnicity\n, wasn\u2019t the response El Segundo-based\nZuru Tech US\n, expected.\n\u201cI think what the general public doesn\u2019t understand is the difficulties in going from an empty lot to a livable house,\u201d Zuru Tech U.S. operations director Marcel Fontijn said. \u201cRebuilding is not for everyone.\u201d\nDesign times, selecting contractors, permit pulls and then the actual construction has led some residents in the fire-impacted areas to\nsell\n.\nFor Zuru Tech, the lots they grabbed up \u2014 15 at last count \u2014 will make for nice case studies for its technology. The company, founded by brothers Nick and Mat Mowbray, makes design and manufacturing software that\u2019s used to power robotic factories owned by its parent Zuru Group of Hong Kong.\nAfter a bit of phone tag with Fontijn,\nThe Real Deal\nsnagged time with the executive to find out more about the company\u2019s lot purchases as part of a broader story on the state of the rebuilding (stay tuned for the November issue of\nTRD\n\u2019s magazine).\n\u201cFor us, we have a research project that focuses on factory-built homes, and we saw an opportunity,\u201d Fontijn said. \u201cIf you imagine there being rebuilding efforts on 300 houses that burned down in terms of how many contractors, how many framers [and] how many roofers, where are you going to pack all these people? And that\u2019s where we really saw that we can provide a solution to a problem.\u201d\nZuru Tech\u2019s homes take between two to three months to install, with the company estimating work on the first of those structures to begin a year from now.\nFuzzy on the numbers\nData sets can always be picked apart.\nThat doesn\u2019t help if you\u2019re an agent in the burn areas looking for market comparables. That was made more challenging when, immediately following the fires, some lot sales were being entered into the Multiple Listing Service as standing, single-family homes. Chalk some of that up to certain software that didn\u2019t upload land contracts. It made for skewed stats in the beginning, but that\u2019s since been ironed out, according to Compass Altadena broker Teresa Fuller.\nFuller told\nTRD\nrecently MLS fines cracked down on the problem, making for improved numbers for those such as herself closely tracking the market.\nLast year, over 350 homes were sold in Altadena. This year, there have been 69, Fuller said. Prices per square foot for standing structures dropped to as low as $738 a foot in May, and have since risen to $771.\n\u201cIt\u2019s much more hopeful. We\u2019re seeing housing starts if you drive around Altadena now,\u201d Fuller said. \u201cYou see framing going up. Not a lot, but some. And I think as people are more and more comfortable with what\u2019s being rebuilt, and people begin to trust more that Altadena will once again be the gorgeous mountain town that it was, prices will go back up.\u201d\n\nMore from the interview with Fuller will appear in the November issue of the magazine.\nMissed deadline\nAfter an Oct. 2 deadline to clear fire debris came and went, a Palisades mansion featured in HBO\u2019s \u201cSuccession\u201d, and seven other properties were deemed\npublic nuisances\n.\nThe properties include single-family homes, apartments and commercial real estate, per a report from the\nLos Angeles Times\n.\nIf the property owners can\u2019t get rid of the toxic rubble, the city will step in to handle the cleanup. The owners, however, will have to pay up for the service.\nNew record\nIt\u2019s been a while since the San Diego County residential market turned heads.\nThis past week, the Del Mar home at\n2920 Camino Del Mar\ntraded for $50 million to make for the county\u2019s priciest-ever sale.\nThat edges past a $47 million deal that closed this year, about 11 miles south of Del Mar in San Diego\u2019s La Jolla neighborhood.\nFalling apart\nSometimes you just have to walk away. At least, that\u2019s what an increasing number of homebuyers are doing.\nAugust saw the highest share ever, or 15.1 percent, of signed contracts nationally falling out of escrow, according to\nRedfin data\n. The company\u2019s data goes back to 2017.\nFor Los Angeles, specifically, 14.9 percent of sales fell out of contract in August, which is down from 15 percent in the year-ago period.\nThe biggest stated reason for buyers saying good-bye: inspection or repair issues.\n",

You can see the top 10 single-family sales in the City of Los Angeles through Aug. 25 by clicking\nhere\n.\nThe Australian billionaire, who is the former chair of Crown Resorts and the son of the late Australian media mogul Kerry Packer, picked up the property on May 6.\nOften called \u201cLe Belvedere,\u201d the French chateau-inspired property has 10 bedrooms and 15 bathrooms, indoor pool, outdoor pool, spa and wellness center. The home spans 35,000 square feet and sits on a\u00a0 2.2-acre lot.\n\nCarolwood Estates\u2019 Stephen Resnick and David Parnes listed the home for a Europe-based limited liability company linked to UK native Richard Livingstone. He and his brother Ian are the billionaire co-founders of London &amp; Regional Properties. Westside Estate Agency co-founder Kurt Rappaport and Carolwood Estates co-founder Drew Fenton represented Packer in the deal.\nDeveloper Mohamed Hadid \u2014 father of supermodels Gigi and Bella Hadid \u2014 built the home in 2007 and sold it in 2010 for $50 million to a limited liability company linked to Sarp Turanligil, a Turkish yacht magnate, according to public documents. Hadid then reportedly leased it back.\nHadid included a 60-seat screening room and a master suite featuring a walk-in closet large enough for 1,000 pairs of shoes, according to a former listing cited by\nMansion Global\n.\nThe property last traded hands in 2018. It was listed for $85 million in December 2016 and then for $72 million in January 2018, before selling for\n$56 million\nin May 2018 to an LLC controlled by Los Angeles-based investor Max Fowles-Pazdro.

        "content": "Baird &amp; Warner is launching an initiative to bring more cohesion and tools to its Chicago-based agents as it seeks to stand out in a market against growing consolidation and national brands.\nThe brokerage with strong suburban footholds nearly doubled its agent count in the city of Chicago\nwhen it acquired Dream Town\nearlier this year, it said in a press release. The new initiative, called the \u201cCity Collective,\u201d will help unite its 800 city agents and give them new communications lines, tools and technology to compete, the company said.\nMost of Baird &amp; Warner\u2019s volume currently stems from outside the city proper: About 65 percent of the sales volume between Baird &amp; Warner and Dream Town year-to-date happened in the suburbs and outside Chicago, according to data provided by a spokesperson.\nThe focus on ramping up sales in the city will help Baird &amp; Warner\u2019s operations across the board, according to an interview with David Bailey, Baird &amp; Warner\u2019s senior vice president and general sales manager. Migration between the city and suburbs is a large factor in the market, and having a bigger focus on the city can help the firm capture more of the market, he told\nThe Real Deal\n.\n\u201cHistorically, we\u2019ve been able to serve the entire Chicagoland community very effectively,\u201d he said. \u201cThe relationships between our suburban brokers and our city brokers are only going to get deeper now.\u201d\nBaird &amp; Warner, which has had a Chicago presence for 170 years, also used the initiative to take shots at its biggest competitor, Compass, which acquired homegrown @properties last year to become the largest Chicago brokerage by far. Compass also intends to take over\nAnywhere Real Estate\n, which would bring several more of Chicago\u2019s top brokerages under Compass\u2019s umbrella.\nBaird &amp; Warner is the largest independent brokerage in Chicago, and combined with Dream Town\u2019s performance would have came in second in\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nrankings of top brokerages\nby Cook County sales volume in 2024, after the combined volume of Compass and @properties.\nBaird &amp; Warner framed the initiative as a way to make the independent firm stand out against \u201cWall Street-run firms,\u201d and the press release criticizes Compass specifically. It\u2019s the second time in recent weeks the local firm has\ndirectly bashed the national giant\nin public communications materials.\n\nBailey said private exclusive networks like Compass\u2019 marketing models are bad for consumers, noting Baird is a transparent alternative. Compass has\npushed for a marketing strategy\nin which some properties start out marketed internally only to other Compass agents.\n\u201cIt\u2019s being veiled in innovation and some impressive new marketing approach, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about that. I think it\u2019s just about control,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re not looking to serve the consumer, they\u2019re looking to get both sides of the deal.\u201d\nCompass has defended its private marketing strategy as an option that gives sellers more choice in how to market their homes. In a statement, Compass spokesperson Devin Daly said the firm \u201cthinks homeowners should be able to choose the best strategy for selling their homes.\u201d He pointed to Compass research that found pre-marketed homes brought in higher closing prices and sold faster after hitting public networks.\nCompass has made its own technology suite a cornerstone of its sales pitch to brokers, including a tool announced this week that it says will help listing agents find potential buyers in the Compass network based on buyer activity and search data.\nBaird &amp; Warner didn\u2019t give specific details about the new tools coming for its agents under the City Collective program. Its press release noted new technology and AI tools, new internal communication tools and listing and marketing strategies. The company also said the initiative would give agents updates on local regulations, neighborhood trends and conduct regular meetings across its city brokerages.\nBailey said the suite of tools would include \u201cadditional enhanced marketing opportunities\u201d and a tech stack, and that they would be released over the rest of this year and early 2026. He said the tools will combine the data and AI expertise of Baird &amp; Warner with the marketing and technology tools of Dream Town into a more cohesive product.\n\u201cCombining those two together is what\u2019s going to allow us to take a big step forward,\u201d he said.\n",

        "content": "Todd Glaser,\na spec developer\nknown for pushing the boundaries in South Florida, is putting down roots in the South Fork and bringing his appetite for renovations to the wealthy enclave.\nGlaser paid $16.25 million for a historic home at 186 Main Street in Sag Harbor, the developer told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nBuilt in 1834 by a prominent whaling family\n, the property dubbed the Hannibal French House now stands at 6,500 square feet on .59 acres of land on Captain\u2019s Row in Sag Harbor Village. After expansions in the 19th century, Charles Edison, the former governor of New Jersey and son of Thomas Edison, purchased the home 1948 and commenced on a major restoration.\nThe seven-bedroom, four-bathroom property is also notably home to Sag Harbor\u2019s only formal ballroom according to the property listing.\n\u201cWe love old stuff,\u201d Glaser said of being drawn to the historic home, which he said he\u2019ll leave basically untouched.\n\nHe and his wife, interior designer Kim Aimee Glaser, have been on the hunt for a new place to call home after selling their Nantucket house two years ago. The couple picked up a waterfront Newport Beach house for $9 million last year, which Glaser, who spent nearly two decades in Nantucket, said wasn\u2019t the right fit.\n\u201cThe bottom line is my wife, this is her dream house,\u201d he said.\nCorcoran\u2019s Susan Breitenbach\nhad the listing.\nGlaser, who made a name for himself with\naudacious spec developments in Miami and Palm Beach\n, said in 2024 he had shifted his focus to\nrenovations over building from scratch\n\u2014 something he said he\u2019ll look to continue in the Hamptons.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to start looking for some stuff to renovate, not to build,\u201d he said of tapping into the Hamptons market. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to manage stuff in the Hamptons, and the big builders are building new stuff. So there\u2019s a little pocket that I think I can sneak in.\u201d\nThe Sag Harbor purchase looks quaint in comparison in comparison to the price tag on one of Glaser\u2019s current projects in Florida. He and his partners bought a waterfront home on North Bay Road for $105 million earlier this year. Glaser currently has the home\nlisted as a flip for $169 million\n, but has said he is considering redeveloping the property into a $300 million spec home.",

The court-appointed trustee, Kenneth Silverman, scheduled a December meeting with more than 400 creditors, who together are owed roughly $123.6 million.\n\nNearly $119 million of that stems from unpaid state taxes and penalties owed to New York\u2019s Department of Taxation and Finance. Silverman\u2019s initial filing said \u201cno property appears to be available to pay creditors.\u201d\nFormer chairperson Elan Blutinger, who resigned in December, filed a $214,000 claim for unpaid loans.

        "content": "FGS Global is packing up its Midtown East office for a bigger home near Hudson Yards.\nThe communications and consulting firm signed a 15-year lease for 80,000 square feet at Penn 2, Vornado Realty Trust\u2019s newly redeveloped office tower above Penn Station,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned. The firm will occupy the entire 16th floor and part of the 17th floor. Asking rent for the space was $115 per square foot.\nFGS is relocating from Vornado\u2019s 909 Third Avenue, where it occupies about 60,000 square feet. The move marks an expansion for the firm, which was recently acquired by private equity giant KKR. The relocation brings FGS closer to its new parent company\u2019s headquarters\nin Hudson Yards\n.\nThis marks another win for Vornado\u2019s bet on the Penn District property, where a $750 million renovation was completed last year. The revamped tower features a new glass curtain wall, terraces and upgraded amenities aimed at attracting blue-chip tenants seeking high-end space near a major mass transit hub.\nCBRE\u2019s Michael Liss represented FGS Global in the deal. Vornado was represented in-house by Josh Glick and Jared Silverman, along with a Cushman &amp; Wakefield team led by Josh Kuriloff and Bruce Mosler.\nRepresentatives from Vornado and FGS Global did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe deal comes as the office market shows signs of stabilizing and Manhattan\u2019s Class A towers are quickly filling up. The Penn Station submarket\u2019s vacancy rate was about 19 percent at the end of the third quarter, compared with the borough\u2019s overall rate of 22 percent, according to a Cushman &amp; Wakefield report.\n\nThe lease adds to a string of recent deals at Penn 2, as tenants continue to gravitate toward newly renovated properties near mass transit. Verizon inked a\n200,000-square-foot lease\nlast summer with plans to move its headquarters to the 1.8 million-square-foot building, formerly known as 2 Penn Plaza.\nOther tenants include Madison Square Garden\u2019s corporate offices,\nMajor League Soccer\nand\nUniversal Music Group\n.\n\nFGS Global is taking 80,000 square feet at Vornado\u2019s Penn 2. It signed a 15-year lease.\nIt is moving from Vornado\u2019s 909 Third Avenue and expanding from 60,000 square feet after the firm was recently acquired by KKR.\nIt is moving to be closer to KKR\u2019s headquarters in Hudson Yards. It will occupy all of the 16th floor and part of the 17th floor.\nThe asking rent on those floors is $115 per square foot.\nCBRE\u2019s Michael Liss represented FGS Global.

        "content": "For buyers and sellers of Manhattan\u2019s luxury properties, the fall season is on track to live up to its reputation as a typically busy period for the market.\nBuyers signed contracts for 31 homes in the borough asking $4 million or more last week, up from 30 in the\nprevious period\n, according to Olshan Realty\u2019s report. The totals marked the first time since early June that 30 or more properties landed inked deals in two consecutive weeks.\nA condo at Extell Development\u2019s Central Park Tower was the priciest home to snag a contract, with an asking price just under $55 million. The\n121st floor\nof 217 West 57th Street, which initially asked more than $65 million when sales launched in 2018, sold to a domestic buyer in an all-cash deal, sources told\nThe Real Deal.\nSources added that the full-floor unit will likely close at a price closer to a similar condo on the 116th floor, which was asking $53 million when it found a buyer. The apartment closed for $46 million in April, a discount of 13 percent.\nThe condo a few floors up has five bedrooms and five bathrooms. It also features 11-foot-tall floor-to-ceiling windows with views of Central Park.\nAmenities in the Billionaires\u2019 Row supertall include indoor and outdoor pools, a fitness center and club room on the 100th floor. The skyscraper, marketed as the tallest residential building in the world, has 178 units, two-thirds of which are now sold, according to data from Marketproof.\nAn in-house team with Gary Barnett\u2019s firm, led by Gabriele Tonini and Tim Rizzo, and another with Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, led by Kane Manera and Janet Wange, are handling sales at Central Park Tower.\n\nThe second most expensive home to enter contract was a condo at Zeckendorf Development\u2019s\n15 Central Park West\n, with an asking price of $25 million. Unit 29A, which hit the market in May, spans 3,100 square feet and has three bedrooms and three bathrooms.\nThe apartment, which also features a library and formal dining room, last traded in 2008 for $10.5 million.\nThe Robert A.M. Stern-designed building, dubbed \u201cLimestone Jesus,\u201d has amenities such as a fitness center, pool, private restaurant and terrace.\nCorcoran\u2019s Deborah Kern had the listing.\nOf the 31 properties, 22 were condos, six were co-ops, two were condops and one was a townhouse.\nThe homes\u2019 combined asking price was $344 million, for an average price of $11.1 million and a median of $7.5 million. The typical home spent about a year and a half on the market and was discounted 10 percent from the original listing price.\n",

        "content": "While UDR\nlooks to sell\nits Columbus Square rental buildings, Stellar Management and the Chetrit Group are facing familiar distress on the connected retail component.\nThe loan backing the outdoor mall on Columbus Avenue between West 97th and 100th streets was sent to special servicing, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The transfer took place \u201cafter missing several loan payments over the last few months,\u201d as disclosed by Morningstar Credit Analytics.\nRepresentatives for the two ownership entities did not comment to the publication, only adding to the mystery of why the loan is in special servicing for a second time. Local eyes and ears have seen little in the way of changes to business or consumer activity at the 270,000-square-foot shopping center, which is anchored by Whole Foods and Target.\nThe loan ended up in special servicing in late 2023 due to pandemic-induced retail tenant distress. Ownership ultimately agreed to a three-year extension on the $360 million mortgage.\nThis is just the latest blow to the Chetrits, particularly Meyer Chetrit. Last month, he was\nindicted\non criminal charges, accused of harassing older, rent-regulated tenants in Chelsea over five years. He pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nChetrit is facing several civil suits, including\naccusations that he is shielding assets to avoid paying a $132 million judgment\nto a lender.\nThe Chetrits are allegedly defaulting on nearly $2 billion worth of loans, according to court documents and ratings agencies, including $280 million they personally guaranteed.\nMeanwhile, Colorado-based multifamily real estate investment trust UDR and its partner, MetLife, are seeking up to $500 million in a sale of Columbus Square rental buildings. UDR bought the buildings at 775, 795, 805 and 808 Columbus Avenue, as well as 801 Amsterdam Avenue, in 2012 for $635 million from Stellar and Chetrit, which did not include the retail assets in the deal.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Chicago landlords are facing an unexpected new expense line item:\nfear\n.\nA wave of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids across the city and its suburbs has left tenants missing rent, contractors skipping work sites and property managers bracing for rising costs. The disruption adds strain to a market already short of more than 100,000 affordable units, according to some counts. Landlords estimate up to 40 percent of their contractors are now absent, while some tenants \u2014 including those with legal residency \u2014 are too afraid to leave home, the Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\n.\nOwners say they\u2019ve been absorbing the\nfallout\nbut warn that if raids persist through spring moving season, rents could rise to offset the losses. Jeff Weinberg of Drexel Properties, with 1,100 units citywide, told the outlet that the enforcement drag \u201cis going to hurt renters at the bottom of the bottom rung the most.\u201d\nFor John Warren of Forte Properties, the shock came Oct. 7, when armed ICE agents appeared at one of his Cicero buildings. Warren oversees about 450 units across Latino-heavy suburbs like Berwyn and Cicero, and says since the raid, \u201cresidents are scared to open their doors.\u201d Maintenance staff are staying home, and tenants who miss work are falling behind on rent.\nOther operators told the outlet similar stories. Crews are refusing to show up at buildings where agents have been spotted. In one highly publicized\nSouth Shore raid\n, federal agents in military gear tore through an apartment complex on South Shore Drive, arresting 37 people, including U.S. citizens, according to the Department of Homeland Security. ICE said some detainees were suspected of gang or drug ties, but has not provided evidence.\n\nGene Lee of TLG Development, who owns 18 South Side apartments, said labor costs are up as longtime contractors disappear. Tracy Scanlon, who manages 1,000 North Side units, said maintenance delays have stretched to weeks, leaving units unrentable and costs mounting. Adding to that, landlords have\nlimited legal recourse\nregarding police and federal conduct within their buildings, even in common areas or a tenant\u2019s apartment.\n\u201cInefficiencies hurt our community and make housing more expensive to provide,\u201d Warren said. \u201cAmerica was built by immigrants. For us to be chasing the good guys is counterproductive.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Lee, a Howard alum, said in a statement that she has been \u201cleading discussions with Howard University and will continue to engage with them about exploring opportunities in Oakland.\u201d\nHoward representatives have reportedly already toured several downtown properties, including the largely vacant Trans Pacific Centre at 1000 Broadway. The school purportedly is eyeing 60,000 square feet at the tower, which would be about one full floor at the 375,000-square-foot building. The property is owned by Florida-based GCB Associates and lost major tenants like the Oakland Unified School District and Cal State East Bay. GCB previously proposed\nconverting the office tower to residential use\n.\nAcross the Bay, other universities with San Francisco satellites could breathe new life into emptied-out office buildings.\n\nThe Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania signed a long-term lease\nfor the entire 80,000-square-foot \u201cCube\u201d\nbuilding at 345 Montgomery Street, part of the 555 California Street complex owned by Vornado Realty Trust and the Trump Organization. The world-renowned business school is expected to move into the building in the next year and a half.\nNashville-based\nVanderbilt University\n, meanwhile, is\nnarrowing its search\nfor a place to plant a flag in San Francisco. The research university reportedly has its sights set on the forthcoming 5M Project mixed-use development in South of Market.\nIn downtown Oakland, local Samuel Merritt University will open its new $240 million campus at 525 12th Street come January.

The all-cash deal values Plymouth at $2.1 billion, including outstanding debt.\nSixth Street Partners submitted an unsolicited takeover bid for the company in mid-August; Makarora and Ares\u2019 agreement valued the company at nearly twice the amount of the Sixth Street deal.\nIn a statement, Makarora founder Chad Pike said the \u201cproperties are well positioned to capitalize on strong industrial demand from these major population centers,\u201d referencing how the Midwest and East Coast properties are located a day\u2019s drive from a majority of the country\u2019s population.\nPlymouth\u2019s board of directors approved the merger, but shareholders still need to have their say.

The properties spent 85 days on the market, on average.\nTwenty-two luxury listings were added to the market, for a total of 1,184 listings.\nThe\nprevious week\n, buyers signed contracts for 16 properties in Miami-Dade, asking a combined $159.1 million.\nThe asking dollar volume for the eight single-family homes and five condos under contract last week totals $103 million, according to the report published by the Douglas Elliman team led by Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes.\nThe single-family homes that entered into contract last week have an average asking price of $9 million and spent an average of 77 days on the market. They total $71.9 million in asking dollar volume.\n\nMenin renovated the 0.3-acre property at 5300 North Bay Road into the Mediterranean-modern style his company, Menin Homes, uses. The property includes a four-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bathroom main house, a detached three-bedroom and three-bathroom guest house, a garage, Jacuzzi, pool and outdoor kitchen. The home is asking $32.5 million with One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agents Marko Gojanovic, Reid Heidenry and Roberto Quiroz, who are with MR Luxury Group. Though\nMenin\nis listed as the owner, Weiner is the true owner, he\nconfirmed\nto\nThe Real Deal\nearlier this year.\nWeiner made his fortune with the $3.9 billion sale of Rockstar Energy to PepsiCo in 2020.\nThe condos that secured buyers last week have an average asking price of $6.2 million and spent 98 days on the market, on average. They total $31.1 million in asking dollar volume, or an average of $2,002 per square foot.\nPenthouse 1617 at 1 Hotel &amp; Homes, at 102 24th Street in Miami Beach, led the condo component of the report.

        "content": "Data centers have become one of the hottest plays in Chicagoland\u2019s industrial market, but some suburban communities are pumping the brakes.\nAurora\u2019s city council approved a 180-day moratorium on new data centers and warehouses in\nSeptember\n, citing the need to study zoning standards and environmental impacts. The pause comes after residents complained about persistent noise from diesel generators and HVAC systems tied to existing data centers, the Daily Herald\nreported\n.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just trying to give us time to make sure that we have the proper guardrails in place,\u201d Mayor John Laesch told the outlet.\nIn Naperville, city officials are considering a similar step. Councilman Ian Holzhauer said the city should coordinate with peer communities to set consistent regional standards rather than \u201creinvent the wheel.\u201d The Naperville Environment and Sustainability Task Force has called for a six-month pause, warning that a proposed data center by developer\nKaris Critical\nwould consume more than 10 percent of the city\u2019s peak electricity demand.\nA flurry of data center moves in Aurora and across the Chicago area may account for the hesitancy. Five data centers have already gone up in\nAurora\n, with five more entitled and two new applications filed just before the moratorium took effect. Developers have clustered data centers in recent years near O\u2019Hare International Airport, especially in adjacent\nElk Grove Village\n, and an office tower in downtown Chicago recently sold to a Virginia company planning to convert it into a\n33-megawatt data center\n.\n\nKaris, which plans a 36-megawatt facility on 40 acres at the former Lucent campus, pushed back. Company spokesman Patrick Skarr said Naperville already retooled its zoning in 2023 to allow the city to impose conditions on data center projects. The developer pledged to offset 100 percent of its IT power load with renewable energy credits.\nAcross the region, the data center debate has become a test of how far suburbs are willing to go to accommodate energy-hungry infrastructure. Geneva Mayor Kevin Burns, who chairs the Metropolitan Mayors Caucus\u2019 energy committee, said that along with the revenue and capacity data centers bring, they also stress existing resources.\nAurora\u2019s temporary pause could be extended as officials weigh new zoning rules and long-term infrastructure costs. Developers such as CyrusOne, which operates in the city, say they\u2019re cooperating with local leaders to install sound walls and noise-mitigation systems.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Both companies have their North American headquarters in Plano. Ericsson employs 3,300 people in the north Dallas suburb; Assa Abloy employs 200.\nPlano Mayor John Muns and City Manager Mark Israelson made the trip. Just this year, Plano representatives have also traveled to Toronto, Canada, and Paris, France, and last year Mayor Muns visited Taiwan, said Doug McDonald, Plano\u2019s director of economic development.\nThe Collin County suburb, long known for snagging corporate heavyweights like\nToyota\n, JPMorgan Chase and Liberty Mutual, continues to punch above its weight despite giving up a key funding tool. Plano sends one cent of every sales tax dollar to the Dallas Area Rapid Transit system, meaning less cash for economic development than its neighboring cities, which aren\u2019t part of DART.\nThat fiscal reality hasn\u2019t slowed growth, said Doug McDonald. He credits the time and resources spent building relationships with companies, he told the outlet.\n\nBoth\nAT&amp;T\nand the\nDallas Stars\nhave recently considered what Plano has to offer as each considers a Dallas exit.\nIt\u2019s a strategy that\u2019s worked for decades. Plano has managed to retain legacy employers while landing new ones drawn to its mix of Class A office space, transit access and quality-of-life amenities. The city\u2019s deliberate focus on cultivating long-term corporate relationships, rather than relying on deep incentive packages, has helped insulate it from the boom-and-bust cycles that often hit suburban office markets.\nLocal officials frame the city\u2019s approach as \u201chigh touch\u201d economic development. McDonald said Plano\u2019s team prioritizes ongoing engagement with executives \u2014 helping them navigate everything from workforce issues to permitting \u2014 to keep companies rooted even when market dynamics shift.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The Los Angeles Lakers star is currently sharing the court with his son Bronny in what could be James senior\u2019s last season in the NBA before retirement.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time James knocked down a home to build something bigger and better. His home in Akron, Ohio, which he purchased at 18 years old in 2003 after being the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft, was leveled to make way for a mansion estimated to be worth more than $10 million. That property spans 30,000 square feet and has six bedrooms and 10 bathrooms plus a bowling alley, recording studio, barbershop and two-story closet.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A waterfront home in Lake Geneva sold for $8.7 million, becoming the latest high-end home to sell fast in the Wisconsin resort town.\nThe house was listed as \u201ccoming soon\u201d in the Milwaukee-area MLS in late August by Bob Webster of Compass. It officially hit the market Sept. 2 and went under contract the next day. The house sold for $15,000 over the asking price.\nThe 9,000 square-foot lakehouse at N2224 Bonnie Brae Lane was the latest to find a buyer lightning fast in the resort town, where public listings are slim and demand on the second home market is strong. It features five bedrooms and five-and-a-half bathrooms and sits on a 1-acre lot with 110 feet of beach frontage. David Curry, who represented the buyer, could not be reached for comment.\nWebster previously told\nThe Real Deal\nthat demand in the region is as higher than he\u2019s ever seen it, and he said he received huge interest in two recent listings.\n\u201cIf we see some other things coming on the market here between now and the end of the year, I would predict that we\u2019d see a similar quick response from the market with anything in that kind of a price range,\u201d Webster said\nHe\nhas another listing on South Lake Shore Drive\nin Lake Geneva that went under contract within a few days of listing at $9.8 million, and Webster expects it to close Oct. 31. Both were listed on the Milwaukee-area MLS using a delayed listing, which markets the property as \u201ccoming soon\u201d to other brokers and on some listing services before it officially goes on the market.\nSeveral houses priced higher than $5 million have gone on the market this year and\nfound buyers quickly in Lake Geneva\n. Last week, a 7,500 square-foot lakefront\nhouse on Bayview Drive\nsold about a month after hitting the market, after\ngoing under contract in six days\n, according to listing services. And in the last month, two more properties priced at $5 million and above found buyers in days: A $7.4 million house on Hillside Drive was listed Sept. 24 and went under contract Oct 2. Another lakefront house on Park Drive, listed for $6 million, hit the market Oct. 1 and found a buyer the same day.\n\nA few of those listings have also used the delayed listing strategy to market properties to brokers as \u201ccoming soon\u201d on the MLS before going public. It appears to be contributing to quick sales, as brokers have a few days to share the listings with clients before they start accruing days on market.\nThe pricey deals are driven largely by the low inventory on the lake as most owners are not interested in selling their valuable lakefront property, Webster said. But he noted that the speed of the deals and high value being commanded by recent listings may coax some sellers to come out of the woodwork.\n\u201cIf they had been considering whether this is the right year or the right season or the right time, based on their circumstances, when they see these properties coming out and selling quickly, they conclude that this should be a really good time for them to consider it as well,\u201d he said.\nAt the Bonnie Brae Lane property, Webster said the seller accepted the first offer that came in on the house. He said the buyer is from Illinois and purchased the property as a second home.\nThe new buyer has still not been disclosed. Public records list the previous owners as Thomas and Margaret Riordan.\n",

The project, designed by Revuelta Architecture International with interiors by Robert A.M.

Prices start at $6.3 million, according to the release. The project is expected to be completed in 2029.\nThe condos will range from one-bedroom and one-den units, to five-bedroom units in the condo tower. The condo-hotel building will include one- to four-bedroom units.\nThe project will also have more than 18,000 square feet of interior amenities, and about 50,000 square feet of exterior amenities, including sunrise and sunset pools. It also includes access to the Raymond Jungles-designed Ocean Terrace public park.\n\nOcean Terrace has been in the works for at least a decade, under Scher and Blavatnik\u2019s leadership.\nIn 2021, the Miami Beach Historic Preservation Board approved the latest version of the development. It includes building a 20-story tower and restoring historic structures; and adding 15,000 square feet of commercial space along Collins Avenue and about 3,000 square feet along Ocean Terrace.\nIn February, the new partnership secured an $85 million preconstruction loan from J.P.

In January, Witkoff and Len Blavatnik\u2019s Access Industries sold a 10-acre portion of the former Banyan Cay Resort &amp; Golf Club in West Palm Beach to homebuilder Schickedanz\nfor $15 million\n. Witkoff and Access Industries took the project over after it floundered under the previous developer, Domenic Gatto Jr.\nAnd in New York, the two companies partnered on\nOne High Line\n, previously known as the Xi.\nIn Miami Beach, Witkoff is also leading the redevelopment of the oceanfront\nShore Club\nproperty into the Shore Club Private Collection, an Auberge Resorts Collection-branded 49-unit condo and hotel project at 1901 Collins Avenue.\n",

The\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n, compiled by the team\u2019s Marcy Roth, counts Los Angeles County homes listed for $4 million or more in the Multiple Listing Service.\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\u2019s Tomer Fridman and Douglas Elliman\u2019s Marc Shevin hold the listing.\nThe home first hit the market last spring, with a $17.5 million asking price, according to\nRobb Report\n. In February, the residence reappeared, asking $16.5 million before being reduced in July to the current listing price.\nThe home is located in Hidden Hills\u2019 Ashley Ridge Estates, which is home to celebrities such as Khloe Kardashian and Kris Jenner. Jennifer Lopez and Britney Spears also once had addresses in the upscale enclave named after the late developer\nMike Ashley\n, whose imprint remains on several Hidden Hills mansions.\nAcross the home\u2019s 11,808 square feet are six bedrooms and nine bathrooms. There\u2019s also a gym, home theater and wine cellar. Outdoors, on the over 1.5-acre lot, is a pool, bocce ball court and BBQ area.\nLoughlin\n, known for her role as Aunt Becky on \u201cFull House,\u201d and her fashion designer husband are reportedly separated after nearly three decades together. Their marriage was most recently tested with the 2019 college admissions scandal that led to prison time for both. The two pleaded guilty in 2020 to wire and mail fraud involving fraudulent admission of their two daughters into the University of Southern California. Loughlin served two months in prison, while Giannulli was sentenced to five months. Each was also fined and ordered to complete community service.\n\nTheir Hidden Hills home led the pack of signed contracts by a wide margin, with the property in the No. 2 spot held by 116 South Carmelina Avenue in Brentwood. That property is asking $9.3 million, or $1,238 per square foot.\nThe six-bed, eight-bath home sprawls across nearly 7,500 square feet and sits on a lot that\u2019s just over 9,000 square feet.\nThe home was meant for entertaining with a bar, wine cellar, screening room, pool and outdoor BBQ area.\nProperty records show the seller is a Virginia shell company called Tonbridge Road, which bought the home in 2019 for $6.9 million.\nBeverly Hills Estates\u2019 Rayni Williams and Branden Williams hold the listing.\nAcross Los Angeles County, the residential market has quieted some in recent weeks, with last week seeing 23 homes go into contract. That equated to nearly $142 million in asking volume, which was still robust relative to a year ago when total volume was 39 percent less, according to the Eklund Gomes report.\n",

Dallas Country Club also ranked second statewide by asset value and led Texas in revenue, pulling in $32 million last year \u2014 ninth-highest in the country.\nNationwide, member-owned country club assets jumped 27 percent from 2020 to 2023, from a median of $1.4 million to $1.8 million. The surge reflects both a pandemic-driven influx of new members and a costly \u201camenity arms race\u201d as clubs seek to stand out with lifestyle upgrades beyond the fairway.\nClubs that are leaning heavily into wellness and performance offerings are becoming the most successful, Mark Kovacs, a private club adviser, told the outlet. Kovacs pointed to an influx of health-focused additions \u2014 like cold plunges, infrared saunas and biometric tracking \u2014 as members demand facilities that cater to every generation.\n\u201cLuxury is shifting from material exclusivity to optimal health and time well spent,\u201d Kovacs said.\n\nThat shift is reshaping club campuses into full-blown retreats. Noah DiPasquale, founder of Arizona-based Epic Golf Club, said the\nnext wave\nwill be \u201cdestination clubs\u201d where members can spend an entire weekend without leaving the grounds.\nThe founders of coworking company Common Desk, Nick Clark and Dawson Williams, are\ndeveloping a new club in Lake Highlands\n. The club is supposed to include a 6,000-square-foot pool, a gym with yoga and pilates studios, spa features like a sauna and cold plunge, plus two restaurants.\nRising land values and water constraints will continue to present challenges, making it harder to develop new courses near major metros, while existing clubs face mounting pressure to justify ballooning dues. Membership costs for golf clubs grew 9 percent from 2022 to 2023 and another 5 percent through mid-2025, according to Club Benchmarking\u2019s Chris Davis.\nDespite predictions of a slight dip in total course numbers through 2027, analysts expect a rebound beginning in 2028 as the industry stabilizes.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The deal, which still requires court and bondholder approval, would mark Dan Hotels\u2019 first step into the U.S. market following its recent international expansion in India, where it opened The Den hotel in Bangalore.\n\u201cIn coordination with our lenders, and following the successful sale of Sapir Corp\u2019s final asset \u2026 we have decided to exit the Israeli market,\u201d Sapir said in a statement. \u201cThis decision took into account many factors including negative hotel market headwinds, a high-interest rate environment and an increasingly strong shekel compared to the US dollar.\u201d\nDan Hotels plans to renovate the 264-key hotel at 9 Crosby Street following the purchase,\nThe Jerusalem Post\nreported. Eastdil Secured advised Sapir Corp in the deal.\nThe sale represents a long-awaited exit from a property that has faced a years-long debt struggle.\n\nSapir and partner Gerard Guez bought the Nomo Soho from Deutsche Bank for $208 million in 2015, following a foreclosure sale. Sapir later bought out Guez\u2019s 49 percent stake, taking nearly full ownership. Over the years, the hotel has undergone several refinancings \u2014 including a $115 million loan from Goldman Sachs in 2019.\nSapir refinanced the hotel in 2022 with an\n$89 million loan\nfrom the Israeli bond market, just in time to pay down the previous loan from\nGoldman Sachs\n.\nBut as an outstanding $34 million debt came due in 2024, Sapir requested to push it back in exchange for a $6 million partial payoff and an increased interest rate. In July, Sapir Corp failed to make a $3 million payment, putting the firm in default. Last year, the hotel\u2019s value dipped to $179 million.\nA sleek boutique hotel known for its vine-covered entrance and modern design, Nomo Soho struggled during the pandemic, when occupancy plummeted to just 1.9 percent in April 2020. To shore up finances, Sapir Corp put the hotel on the market last year and replaced its management company in February, cutting management fees in half.\nSapir Corp is one arm of Alex Sapir\u2019s real estate companies. The Nomo Soho appears to be is one of only two remaining assets held by Sapir Corp. The other is an undeveloped site near Miami\u2019s Wynwood area that the company recently re-listed for $41 million. That property is in sale discussions, according to the filing.\n",

        "content": "The saga to sell the Woolworth Mansion is finally coming to an end.\nThe townhouse at 4 East 80th, last asking\njust under $50 million\n, finally found a buyer, according to a Streeteasy listing. The pending deal comes roughly 14 years after the owners, the family of the late gym mogul Lucille Roberts, first sought to offload the home.\nThe 20,000-square-foot property\u2019s latest stint on the market began last November, when the Roberts family listed it for $59 million. They dropped the asking price by $10 million in March and started\nsearching for a tenant\nfive months later, asking $125,000 a month for the furnished home.\nThe family initially listed the mansion \u2014 built in 1915 for Helena Woolworth McCann, daughter of \u201cFive-and-Dime\u201d store magnate, Frank Woolworth \u2014 in 2011 for a whopping $90 million. They pulled the 35-foot-wide townhouse off the market two years later without a deal, and instead found a tenant in 2021 with a monthly rent of $80,000.\nRoberts and her husband, commercial real estate investor Bob Roberts, paid the Young Men\u2019s Philanthropic League $6 million for the home in 1995 and renovated it. Roberts, who founded a chain of all-women gyms, died in 2003.\n\nThe seven-story mansion, decorated in the French Gothic style, has nine bedrooms, seven bathrooms and an elevator. It also features a wood-panneled library, patio, solarium and rooftop terrace. The sixth floor is currently outfitted with a gym and sauna.\nThe Modlin Group\u2019s Adam Modlin, who\u2019s representing the sellers, declined to comment on the pending transaction.\nThe signed contract comes after a deal for another Upper East Side townhouse\nhit the books\nlast week. A Gilded Age mansion at 10 East 67th Street sold for $36 million, a 30 percent discount from its initial asking price of $50 million. The home, known as the Jules Bach Mansion, was the site of a fire, which killed socialite Kitty Meyer and her friend, actress Zohra Lahrizi Zondler, in 1997.\nThe Woolworth Mansion, originally designed by Charles P.H. Gilbert, is the most expensive townhouse to enter contract since another at 973 Fifth Avenue\nsnagged a buyer\nin February. At the time the contract was signed, the home was asking $50 million, down $30 million from its price when it hit the market in 2021. It closed for $46 million in May.\n",

The properties include 600, 719\u2013737, 741, 801\u2013821 Lincoln Road and 723 North Lincoln Lane. It\u2019s unclear if Comras has an equity partner.\nNew York-based Morgan Stanley has been trying to sell the buildings this year, after buying them as part of a larger portfolio purchase in 2014, in a deal valued at $342 million. Miami Beach-based Terranova sold the properties at the time, retaining a stake.\nTenants include The Cheesecake Factory, Salt &amp; Straw, It\u2019Sugar and Lincoln Eatery.\nThis year, Duane Reade drugstore\u2019s Cohen family was under contract for more than $150 million to purchase the buildings, but the deal fell through because the Cohens couldn\u2019t find an equity partner or secure debt, the Commercial Observer reported.\nComras founded his eponymously named firm in 1992 after moving to South Florida from New York. The company, which also has a leasing brokerage division, already is a landlord on Lincoln Road.\nIts properties include 635-639, 701 and 734-744 Lincoln Road, according to the company\u2019s website. Tenants there include Aldo, Swarovski and Hoka.\n\nLincoln Road is South Beach\u2019s pedestrian promenade that developer Carl Fisher created in the early 1910s. It was redesigned by architect Morris Lapidus and converted to pedestrian-only in the 1950s.\nOver the years, it attracted hefty investment. In 2015, Comras sold the Lincoln Road block at 1001-1035 Lincoln Road to Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega for\n$370 million\n. Vornado sold the building at 1100 Lincoln Road in 2022 to an affiliate of Steve Gozini\u2019s Los Angeles-based BH Properties for\n$93.6 million.\nYet, in more recent years, Lincoln Road has lost some of its luster to newer competing retail and dining hubs such as the Miami Design District and Wynwood. Last year, Tricera Capital and investors Scott Robins and Philip Levine paid\n$13.6 million\nfor 318-334 Lincoln Road, marking a discount from the $20.5 million Aby Rosen\u2019s RFR Realty had paid in 2019. Also last year, Torose Equities bought 910 Lincoln Road for $10.4 million, a discount from the\n$15.8 million\nseller Invesco Real Estate had paid in 2010.\nMany storefronts are currently vacant, and the Regal South Beach movie theater is shuttered.\nStill, investors and developers are planning projects. Lionstone Development, the Ben-Josef Group and Flag Luxury Group started in August the first phase of their planned\n$12 million\nstreetscape improvement at the 100-300 blocks of Lincoln Road. The developers, who own Sagamore and Ritz-Carlton South Beach hotels at 1671 Collins Avenue and 1 Lincoln Road, plan a 15-story, 30-unit condo tower on the property. It will be branded Billionaires\u2019 Beach.\nNear Lincoln Road, Paul Cejas, former ambassador to Belgium and the chairman of PLC Investments, wants to develop a\n15-story, 210-unit\napartment tower at 1600 Washington Avenue and 1601 Drexel Avenue.\nIn August, Robert Rivani paid\n$37 million\nfor the historic Lincoln Theatre building anchored by H&amp;M at 551 Lincoln Road.\n\u2013\u2013\nLidia Dinkova",

        "content": "Another developer is throwing their hat in the ring to redevelop a suburban Chicago country club and golf course for industrial use \u2014 but not without resident opposition.\nRyan Companies, the Minneapolis-based developer behind projects for Amazon and Target, entered one of Chicagoland\u2019s longest-running real estate battles \u2014 the redevelopment of\nCalumet Country Club\n, located at 2136 175th Street, straddling the Hazel Crest and Homewood border. The company confirmed this month that it has a purchase and sale agreement for the 130-acre property, where multiple past attempts to rezone the site for industrial use have met fierce resistance, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nRyan\u2019s\nvice president of real estate development, Kyle Schott, pitched the firm\u2019s interest to\nHazel Crest\u2019s village board\non Oct. 14, describing it as the start of a \u201ctransparent dialogue\u201d with residents about the site\u2019s future.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve identified industrial as a very good use at this stage,\u201d Schott said during the meeting, while emphasizing that other options could be explored depending on market studies and community feedback. \u201cWe have our thoughts, but we need to find alignment with other folks that might have different ideas.\u201d\nThat cautious framing didn\u2019t stop local advocates from sounding the alarm. The South Suburbs for Greenspace coalition, which has fought industrial development of the club since 2020, argues that warehouses would erase one of the area\u2019s few major green spaces \u2014 a tree-dense site providing what they call an essential air buffer between Interstates 80 and 294.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t meet people anywhere who are for this development,\u201d said co-founder Liz Varmecky, who said her group has canvassed thousands of residents. \u201cThere\u2019s almost no green space in Hazel Crest or Homewood \u2026 this is about protecting what\u2019s left.\u201d\nThe latest fight follows a years-long tug-of-war between the two suburbs and\nArizona developer\nWalt Brown Jr., who bought the golf course in 2020 with plans to turn it into a warehouse park. Homewood blocked his rezoning request amid local outcry, prompting Brown to detach the property from the village and have it annexed into Hazel Crest under a legal settlement. His team later sought the same zoning changes through a new firm, Catalyst Consulting, before those efforts also stalled.\nHazel Crest residents \u2014 a majority-Black, largely middle-class community \u2014 view the industrial push as both environmentally and economically harmful. Varmecky said she believes developers assume the area would welcome low-wage warehouse jobs, a notion she called \u201coffensive and out of touch.\u201d\nOpponents want the Forest Preserves of Cook County or another public entity to buy and protect the land instead. They\u2019ve warned that an industrial project would likely depend on a tax increment financing district, or TIF, freezing property tax growth for more than two decades.\nRyan Companies\ndeclined to comment on community opposition. Schott said the firm intends to close on the site \u2014 all at once or in phases \u2014 and proceed with development if it can secure approvals.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The cheapest home sold on the island was more than $1.4 million, with the most expensive reaching nearly $23.7 million.\nBy contrast, Atherton\u2019s 94027 ZIP had a median sales price of more than $8.3 million. The drop to second place marks the first time in the decade-long history of PropertyShark\u2019s ranking that the country\u2019s priciest ZIP code isn\u2019t in California or New York. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s doom and gloom in Atherton, though; it still set a record with a 5 percent increase from the past year. Sales prices in Atherton have ranged from $3.2 million to $51.5 million with a\npurchase by tech executive Stephen Luczo\n.\n\nCalifornia isn\u2019t short on pricey homes despite Atherton\u2019s fall from first place. The Golden State holds 61 percent of the ZIP codes on PropertyShark\u2019s priciest homes list. Of those, 32 were in the Bay Area, more than any other metro area in the country; still, that\u2019s a drop from a pre-pandemic peak of 55 ZIPs.\nIn the top 10, two other communities besides Atherton made it into the top 10 of the country\u2019s priciest ZIPs. Stinson Beach\u2019s 94970 in Marin County saw a 38 percent year-over-year median price increase to $5.2 million, placing it at No. 7 and marking the first time it made it into the top 10. Closer to Atherton in the Peninsula, Los Altos\u2019 94022 came in at No. 9 with a $5.1 million median sales price \u2014 the first time the ZIP has crossed the $5 million median sales price threshold.\nWith 15 ZIPs in Santa Clara County on the list, including Los Altos, it\u2019s the second-most-expensive county in the U.S. behind Los Angeles County. Other Bay Area municipalities with ZIP codes in the top 100 include San Francisco, Saratoga, Palo Alto,\nSunnyvale\n, Stanford, Cupertino, San Carlos,\nSan Mateo\n,\nBelmont\n, Danville, Alamo, Hillsborough, Greenbrae, Ross and\nBelvedere and Tiburon\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The buyer said the 570,000-square-foot property is only 68 percent leased, with about $10 million of annual net operating income.\nAmTrust plans to invest $60 to $70 million to stabilize and lease the building, and expects NOI to increase to $20 million.\nThe company expects to close the deal by the end of the year and is seeking financing of up to 60 to 65 percent of the purchase price.\nSapir\u2019s family has owned the building and another one across the street, the 28-story 261 Madison Avenue, which is not part of the AmTrust deal, since 1997.\n\nThe properties were at the center of a dispute between Sapir and his brother-in-law Rotem Rosen. Sapir sued Rosen in 2022, alleging Rosen lined his pockets with money from the Sapir Organization. Sapir accused Rosen of enlisting his brothers, Sapir Org. general counsel Omer Rosen and head of development Tom Rosen, to issue themselves a $580,000 personal loan from 260-261 Madison Avenue.\nThe two sides settled the case in 2022.\nSapir had put the properties up for sale in 2021, seeking a price tag of $600 million, but no deal ever went through.\nThe buildings, meanwhile, struggled amid the acrimony. The $126 million CMBS loan on the properties was sent to special servicing in November 2022, but soon after Sapir refinanced the properties with $326 million.\nAmTrust, meanwhile, paid $65 million last year to buy Savanna\u2019s 360 Lexington Avenue, a big discount to the $180 million Savanna paid in 2019.\n",

        "content": "The next mayor will need to make a choice about the fate of the Elizabeth Street Garden.\nIn June, the Adams administration\ncanceled\nplans for 123 units of senior housing at the garden site, while touting an agreement with Council member Chris Marte to rezone three other sites that would net 620 affordable units.\nThe decision was a stunning reversal of the administration\u2019s stance on the city-owned site, especially after years of litigation.\nWhen asked at an event hosted by Hell Gate on Friday, Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani confirmed that he would evict the garden from the Nolita site during his first year as mayor, if elected.\nThe response represented a more concrete commitment regarding the garden. He had previously\nindicated\n, before the June primary, that he believed housing should be built on the site.\nFormer Gov. Andrew Cuomo\nhas said\nthat it is a \u201cmistake to close gardens and green spaces\u201d and that the city should focus on other sites suitable for affordable housing. Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa has long opposed evicting the garden.\nIf Mamdani is elected mayor and makes the Elizabeth Street Garden project, dubbed Haven Green, a priority, it will be interesting to see what becomes of the three zonings Marte pledged to support in exchange for sparing the garden. City Council leadership has repeatedly cited the Adams administration\u2019s reversal on the garden as the height of its hypocrisy in pushing the housing ballot measures while also backing off of a housing project that was ready to go.\nIf the\nhousing ballot measures\ndo not pass, perhaps Mamdani\u2019s action on the Elizabeth Street Garden would build enough goodwill with other Council members to convince them to vote against Marte\u2019s wishes on those other rezonings.\nBut as I\u2019ve previously noted, the value of the deal made by the Adams administration disappears if the ballot measures are approved. Marte\u2019s buy-in will not necessarily be needed for those rezonings to move forward (assuming the next administration decides to move forward with those rezonings).\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nIf Mayor Eric Adams stacks the Rent Guidelines Board before he leaves office,\nwho will he appoint\n? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\n\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: New Jersey is home to 16 diners that are open 24/7,\naccording to NJ Advance Media\n.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 MTA officials say that a plan to bring Metro-North trains to Penn Station and open four new stations in the Bronx is delayed by at least three years,\nGothamist reports\n. Agency officials, who blame Amtrak, proposed opening three stations and delivering roughly 50 percent of planned service by 2027, which was when the entire project was supposed to be completed. Now, officials say the project won\u2019t be finished until at least 2030. Amtrak controls much of the route that would bring Metro-North trains to Penn, and the MTA says the federal agency has not cooperated. A spokesperson for Amtrak told Gothamist that the agency is \u201ccommitted\u201d to the project.\n\u2014 A new poll by Suffolk University Boston found that 44 percent of likely NYC general election voters support Zohran Mamdani, compared to 34 percent who support Andrew Cuomo and 11 percent who favor Curtis Sliwa,\nCBS News reports\n. The poll shows that Cuomo has cut Mamdani\u2019s lead in half, by 10 percentage points, compared to the last Suffolk University poll in September.\n\u2014 More than 223,000 New Yorkers voted in the first three days of early voting,\naccording to the city Board of Elections\n.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$16.3 million\nfor a condominium unit at 988 Fifth Avenue. The Upper East Side unit is 3,300 square feet and last sold on the market in 2022 for $14.6 million. Douglas Elliman\u2019s\nRichard Phan\nhas the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$66.2 million\nfor 630 Third Avenue. ATCO Properties &amp; Management sold the 260,000-square-foot office building in Midtown to The Davis Companies,\nper reports\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $11 million for a co-op unit at 800 Park Avenue. The Lenox Hill co-op has six bedrooms and six bathrooms.\nCorcoran\u2019s\nSteven Cohen and Stefanie Ruch have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 71,748-square-foot, 15-story residential building at 4137 Third Avenue in the Bronx. Fernando Geremia of Fred Geremia Architects &amp; Planners is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "Jamaica, Queens, could be the next site for more than 400 affordable housing units.\nA joint partnership unveiled plans for two 14-story mixed-use buildings in Downtown Jamaica. One will contain more than 350 affordable rental units, while the other will be the site of 72 income-restricted condos.\nThe Greater Jamaica Development Corporation is partnering with the Gotham Organization, Monadnock Development and Moses Sole Realty on the plan at 90th Avenue and Parsons Boulevard. The design calls for the redevelopment of a five-story parking garage on the lot that is currently owned by GJDC.\nDevelopment is estimated to cost $200 million or more. The team is calling the development \u201cArras.\u201d\nFinancing for the development has not yet been secured. But the joint venture is targeting tax-exempt multifamily bonds, low-income housing tax credit equity and funding from the city\u2019s housing department. The city operates two programs that could provide financing: the New Construction program for rentals and the Open Door program for condos.\n\n\u201cThe goal of the development is to create housing for the missing middle,\u201d said Bryan Kelly, president of development at Gotham. \u201cOne of the benefits of condominium ownership is creating generational legacy equity in the assets for families down the road.\u201d\nThe Open Door program finances affordable condo and co-op buildings. Apartment owners must personally occupy their units for a certain period of time. The apartment owner can only sell to purchasers who meet similar income requirements.\nThe plan calls for the rentals to target households earning between 30 and 100 percent of the area median income. The condos would target those earning 90 to 100 percent of the AMI.\nGotham has worked on a number of partially affordable developments before, including Gotham Point, a two-tower, 1,130-unit development in Hunter\u2019s Point, Queens, that is 75 percent affordable units.\nKelly said the planned development does not depend on the passage of an awaited\nneighborhood rezoning\n. The Jamaica Neighborhood plan would upzone the area, allowing for upwards of 12,000 new units, if approved by city lawmakers.\n",

        "content": "Two Long Island investment firms known for scooping up distressed shopping malls are back at it in Chicago\u2019s troubled office sector \u2014 this time with a deal for one of the Loop\u2019s marquee high-rises.\nNamdar Realty Group\nand Mason Asset Management reached a preliminary agreement to buy the 40-story tower at 190 South LaSalle Street, according to\nCostar\n. The sale is still in flux and could fall apart amid tight financing conditions, but the Great Neck, New York\u2013based partners are known for paying cash to close even large, complex deals.\nThe price for the 798,000-square-foot building hasn\u2019t been disclosed. The sellers \u2014 Beacon Capital Partners and U.S. Bank, which also occupies space in the tower \u2014 are being represented by Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s Tom Sitz and Cody Hundertmark. A previous buyer, Colorado-based Real Capital Solutions,\nwalked away\nfrom a deal for the property earlier this year.\nIf the deal closes, it would mark Namdar and Mason\u2019s third major office acquisition in downtown Chicago in less than a year. The duo picked up the 57-story\n70 West Madison\ntower and the 47-story\n1 North LaSalle\nby buying out its loan and taking title to the property \u2014 both believed to have traded for a combined $100 million. They\u2019ve also been active on the retail side, paying $23 million for a Magnificent Mile storefront and striking an $8.3 million deal for the retail component of 1 North State, according to Crain\u2019s.\n\nBuilt in 1987 and designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee, 190 South LaSalle is known for its green gabled roof and postmodern profile on the Chicago skyline. Boston-based Beacon bought it in 2019 for $230 million \u2014 or $288 per square foot \u2014 financed by a $167.5 million loan just before the pandemic upended the office market. Beacon later invested another $13.6 million in renovations before putting it on the market this spring.\nAny new owner faces a steep climb. The tower has significant vacancy and will soon lose key tenants, including Bain &amp; Co, which is relocating to\n131 South Dearborn Street\n. Still, for Namdar and Mason \u2014 who last year paid $45 million for Cleveland\u2019s 200 Public Square tower \u2014 Chicago\u2019s discounted towers are in line with their high-risk, high-reward business model.\nThe tower last traded for $230 million ($288 per square foot) in 2019, when Beacon bought it just before the pandemic upended the office sector. The 798,800-square-foot tower has experienced high vacancy in recent years, and Real Capital Solutions was expected to buy the building for less than the $167.5 million loan, provided by U.S. Bank, that Beacon Capital took out on it in 2020.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Brandywine Realty Trust is reworking the vision for its North Austin mixed-use campus Uptown ATX as longtime tenant\nIBM prepares to exit\nand the city\u2019s\noffice market\ncontinues to soften.\nThe Philadelphia-based firm was going to redevelop the campus, but is now planning to focus on renovations, CEO Jerry Sweeney said on the firm\u2019s Oct. 23 earnings call, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nIBM will vacate its 66-acre campus at 11501 Burnet Road \u2014 across from The Domain \u2014 in mid-2027, Sweeney said. That\u2019s when the next development phase of Uptown ATX is slated to begin. Instead of building new towers, Brandywine will focus on upgrading buildings 902, 904 and 906, totaling roughly 500,000 square feet. Brandywine expects to begin delivering renovated space in early 2027.\nWhile Sweeney didn\u2019t explicitly rule out future demolition, the pivot reflects the reality of a sluggish office market. Vacancy rates remain high and few tenants are seeking large new footprints. Other developers across Austin have shelved ground-up projects and are repositioning existing assets instead. Average office rents in the Central Business District hit $64.29 per square foot in the third quarter, compared with $42.23 in North Austin, according to CBRE.\nBrandywine tested the market this spring when it\nlisted 1 million square feet\nof Austin office assets. A company executive said the listings were aimed at gauging pricing, not pulling back from Austin.\n\nUptown ATX remains one of the region\u2019s largest mixed-use projects, envisioned as Austin\u2019s \u201csecond downtown.\u201d So far, Brandywine has completed the 348,000-square-foot One Uptown office tower and the 341-unit Solaris House apartment building on the site\u2019s southern end.\nOne Uptown is showing momentum despite broader leasing headwinds.\nNvidia Corp\n. and cybersecurity firm Axonius Inc. together occupy about 109,000 square feet, and Brandywine is in talks to fill another 75,000 square feet that would bring the building to roughly 60 percent leased. Nvidia also holds expansion rights, executives said. Solaris House, meanwhile, is 99 percent leased after heavy concessions during its first year, and renewal rents are up 8 percent.\nIBM\u2019s relocation plans remain murky. A previous 320,000-square-foot pre-lease with Houston-based Hines fell through, but the company\nsnagged Meta\u2019s space at the Domain\nlast year. Regardless, its exit gives Brandywine both a vacancy challenge and an opportunity to reset Uptown ATX\u2019s next chapter.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The razing of the three-story, 18,000-square-foot building will give way to a luxury condo project dubbed The Moon Court Square.\nAn affiliate of BZ purchased the site in June 2019 for $8.2 million. It\u2019s unclear why it took more than half a decade for the developer to make progress at the site, though the pandemic seems like a logical culprit.\nDetails about the project, including size and unit count, have not been revealed. Zhang did not respond to a request for comment from the outlet.\nZhang\u2019s firm has already developed a number of properties in Long Island City under the \u201cMoon\u201d brand, including another project on Jackson Avenue, one on 27th Street and one on 44th Drive.\n\nThree years ago, Zhang acquired a site at 138-28 Northern Boulevard\nfor $48 million\nfrom Kit Realty LLC. Zhang planned to redevelop the site into a 14-story, mixed-use condominium.\nThe time may be ripe for development in Long Island City. In the spring, the city\nkicked off the process of rezoning\na 54-block area of the Queens neighborhood, intended to allow residential development in areas zoned for industrial use while also encouraging more commercial and light industrial development in other parts of the district.\nThe Department of City Planning estimated that after the rezoning is approved through the seven-month land use review process, 14,700 apartments will be built over the next decade, 4,300 of which will be set aside as income-restricted under MIH.\nThe rezoning could also lead to the creation of 3.5 million square feet of commercial development and 292,000 square feet of community space.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner",

The complaint was filed in New York County Court.\nThe four-story, 46-unit condo building would eventually be torn down and replaced with a\n20-story, 267-unit condo building\n.\nContinuum tapped a national mortgage brokerage firm to shop for financing for the project last year and selected CW, according to the lawsuit.\nOn the morning of the proposed closing this summer, CW alleges that Continuum \u201cthrew a curveball\u201d and was no longer willing to meet negotiated project milestones. Continuum walked away from the deal, according to the complaint.\nThe lawsuit is tied to the term sheet the developer and lender signed, in which Continuum allegedly agreed to pay CW\u2019s expenses for negotiating, underwriting and syndicating the proposed loan. Continuum also agreed to pay a 1 percent break-up fee, CW alleges. CW sued for breach of contract.\n\u201cAfter abandoning the transaction at the last minute, Continuum refused to honor its\nobligation to pay CW\u2019s loan expenses or the break-up fee,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.\nEichner, chairman and CEO of Continuum, declined to comment on pending litigation, but disputed the allegations and said the firm will \u201cvigorously defend ourselves against these spurious charges.\u201d\n\nAn affiliate of Continuum entered into a deal to acquire the units at Mariners Bay, records show. The developer has not yet completed the purchase.\nContinuum did not respond to a request for an update on the buyout, but condo buyouts are often delayed and are\nnotoriously tricky\nto complete.\nThe term sheet between CW and Continuum was based on a purchase price of more than $61 million and a loan amount equal to the lesser of $51 million, an amount not exceeding a 61 percent loan-to-cost ratio based on an approved predevelopment budget, or an amount not exceeding a 75 percent loan-to-cost ratio based on an appraisal of the property, the complaint alleges.\nCW alleges that Continuum\u2019s obligations to reimburse its loan expenses and pay a breakup fee were binding, according to the complaint.\nIts costs and expenses, which CW claims totaled more than $820,000, included paying for a flood risk report, insurance consulting, outstanding judgments and liens, and more. The firm also states that it uncovered issues that included obligations imposed by the city of North Miami and a zoning appeal filed by a neighboring property owner \u201cthat added complexity, delay and cost to the transaction,\u201d the complaint states.\nCW said it only received $325,000 from Continuum in deposits, leaving a shortfall of nearly $500,000 in unpaid expenses. The lending firm is seeking damages totaling no less than $510,000, according to the lawsuit.\nContinuum has a $3 billion, 1,000-unit condo portfolio in South Florida that includes planned projects in North Bay Village and Bay Harbor Islands. In August, Continuum secured a\n$67 million construction loan\nfor the second phase of its Bay Harbor Islands condo project. The developer received the financing for La Baia North from S3 Capital Partners, a New York-based alternative lender that provides middle-market construction loans and bridge loans..\nThis summer, the development firm secured unanimous\napproval\nfrom the North Bay Village Commission for a special area plan, site plan and development agreement for the Continuum Waterfront District. The district is planned to have two Continuum condo towers, a 200-key Continuum hotel and a marina. One tower can now be up to 440 feet tall. The site includes the former Shuckers Waterfront Bar &amp; Grill, now called the Palm Tree Club.\n",

The project will include 25 percent of units designated as permanently affordable, ranging from 40 percent of the area median income to 100 percent of the area median income.\nSergey Rybak, the CEO of Rybak Development, said he expects the project to cost over $350 million.\nAs part of the RFP, developers were required to privately finance the deal, according to Rybak, and the project will be eligible for the 485-x tax abatement. He credited the firm\u2019s local expertise with informing how it underwrote the deal, pointing to a\n499-unit rental building\ncovering 1 million square feet down the street that launched in the last week.\n\u201cConey Island has been historically overlooked due to the lack of new development that is comparable with other areas in Brooklyn that have buildings which are highly-amenitized and located in proximity to transportation,\u201d Rybak said, noting that he\u2019s planning to build out larger units which he hopes will attract Brooklynites from across the borough.\nThe 800,000-square-foot project will receive an additional 175,000 square feet of development rights from the neighboring Coney Island Amphitheater. The project will also include 32,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space, new structured parking and 65,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor amenities.\n\nRybak will be working with Brooklyn-based developer IMC Architecture and construction is expected to begin in 2027 and be completed in 2030.\nA \u2018neighborhood revitalization\u2019\nThe announcement comes during the twilight of Mayor Erc Adams\u2019 administration, which has eased housing restrictions through the\nCity of Yes for Housing Opportunity zoning reforms\nthat are slated to\nenable 80,000 additional units of housing\nto be built throughout the city. NYCEDC chief operating officer Melissa Roman Burch cited the easing of residential parking requirements as one of the features of the legislation that made the development possible.\nThe development, dubbed the Tilyou Towers in honor of the Steeplechase Park founder, is part of a much larger effort from the city to redevelop Coney Island using public works investments and public-private partnerships.\nRybak credited the city\u2019s infrastructure investments with making the project workable. \u201cThis particular development is only possible due to the remapping of streets and introduction of a new street which will complete the four sides of the property as well as the needed flood and storm upgrades,\u201d he said. \u201cPrior to that, this amount of housing would not have been possible.\u201d\nThe city has more plans to invest in the area. Its 2026 capital plan allocates over $1 billion for service improvements and construction on the beach and boardwalk through 2032.\nThe investment into the area has marked a turning point for the city after a 2009 rezoning yielded\nlittle in the way of housing production\n. \u201cThis story really goes back to an important rezoning that the NYCEDC led in 2009 that envisioned a whole neighborhood revitalization that included hundreds of millions of investment into infrastructure,\u201d said Roman Burch.\nIn Coney Island West, two affordable housing projects launched in 2019 and 2022 and a third is slated to open in 2028. The city has also been providing public subsidies to affordable and supportive housing projects in the area, including announcing $90 million in funding in June for a 420-unit affordable development from BFC Partners.\nRybak\u2019s development will consist of an 11-story podium and two 28-story towers, with outdoor amenities that include an infinity-edge swimming pool, lounge, gaming area and playground.\n",

        "content": "New York legislators are taking aim at the insurance crisis battering affordable housing landlords.\nA trio of bills unveiled this week would create a $50 million fund and ramp up oversight of insurers after years of spiraling premiums that advocates say threaten the city\u2019s low-income housing stock, Bisnow\nreported\n.\nAssembly member Em\u00e9rita Torres, who represents the South Bronx, introduced the measures after\na study\nby the National Equity Fund and Enterprise Community Partners found that insurance costs for affordable buildings have more than doubled since 2017, from $712 to $1,495 per unit. The study also found that more than half of affordable landlords are spending more on operating costs than they\u2019re taking in through net income.\nTorres\u2019 package includes a grant fund offering up to $3,000 per unit, or $2 million per project, to help cover the widening gap between insurance bills and landlords\u2019 bottom lines.\nThe other two bills would require annual state reporting on premium rates, nonrenewals and denials, and convene a task force of housing and insurance officials to study the problem and propose long-term fixes.\nRachel Fee, executive director of the New York Housing Conference, who advised on the legislation, told reporters the lack of public data has made it nearly impossible to pinpoint what\u2019s driving the surge.\n\u201cWe have some anecdotes and examples, but we don\u2019t have a real pattern that we can see with any public data,\u201d she said.\n\nThe cost crunch is hitting hardest in the Bronx, where the concentration of rent-stabilized housing is highest in the city. Enterprise\u2019s study pegged the borough\u2019s per-unit insurance cost at $1,806 last year, roughly 6 percent above the citywide average.\nInsurers\u2019 retreat from the market has left landlords with few options.\nThe situation could worsen if mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani delivers on his campaign promise to freeze rents in stabilized units, a move that landlords warn could choke revenue as expenses balloon.\nGov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s office declined to comment on the pending bills but pointed to $1.5 billion in state housing funds earmarked this year to expand affordability. The Legislature won\u2019t reconvene until January, meaning any relief \u2014 if it comes \u2014 is still a ways away.\nIn the meantime, landlords are taking matters into their own hands. A group led by Wavecrest Management\nformed a captive insurance company\nto pool risk and negotiate better rates.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Barbara Corcoran just nabbed a new co-op on Fifth Avenue.\nThe founder of the Corcoran Group and \u201cShark Tank\u201d investor paid $16 million for a penthouse at 1016 Fifth Avenue in what appears to be an off-market deal, according to public records. The deal comes roughly three weeks after she\nclosed a deal\nfor another penthouse in the neighborhood, about a dozen blocks north of her new digs.\nCorcoran paid the full asking price for her latest pad, according to\nCorcoran\u2019s Carrie Chiang\n, who represented her in the deal.\nUnit PH-W hasn\u2019t traded since the city began recording property transactions digitally, so the unit\u2019s price history is unclear. The latest document attached to the apartment is from 2007, when the then-owner transferred it to a trust.\nChiang said the deal came about as she was on the hunt for a penthouse that fit Corcoran\u2019s requirements, including a location in the 80s. She said she found out about the apartment before it hit the market, and Corcoran asked to see it before it was officially listed.\n\u201cBarbara knows what she wants,\u201d Chiang said. \u201cOnce she saw it, she said, \u2018Carrie, I\u2019m not going to lose this one.\u2019\u201d\nThe unit has three bedrooms, formal dining and living rooms, a library and terrace, according to Chiang, who described the home as having tall ceilings and much of its original details. She added that Corcoran plans to move into the apartment shortly and is considering some minor renovations next year.\n\nThe co-op building housing the unit, along with 55 others, was built in 1926. It includes amenities such as a 24-hour doorman and elevator service.\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely the best penthouse I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Chiang said. \u201cShe\u2019s so happy there.\u201d\nSerena Boardman with Sotheby\u2019s International represented the seller.\nCorcoran\nfound a buyer\nfor her previous home, Unit PHB at 1158 Fifth Avenue, just one day after listing the duplex in May. She traded the five-bedroom apartment \u2014 known for its sprawling terrace and dining area encased in glass \u2014\u00a0 for $13.5 million, $1.5 million more than its asking price.\nAt the time of the deal, Corcoran said that she and her husband, Bill Higgins, had their sights set on another pad on the Upper East Side, one without the curving staircase that Higgins was having difficulty climbing safely.\nCorcoran and Higgins, now 76 and 80 years old respectively, bought the co-op at 1158 Fifth Avenue for $10 million in 2015 and shelled out roughly $2 million to renovate it. The couple lived there for a decade before offloading it.\n",

        "content": "Joel Rodstein has stacked 20 years in property management on top of the business degree he earned from the University of California-Santa Cruz. He\u2019s worked his way up to become CEO of North Oak Property Management. Rodstein oversees a portfolio of 185 buildings ranging from commercial to multifamily properties including around 800 units spread over historic Hollywood and hip NoHo Arts District.\nThese days, Rodstein spends a good chunk of time every week handling the sort of paperwork that seems more in line with an administrative assistant\u2019s duties.\n\u201cI spend two to three hours a week just reviewing paperwork like this,\u201d said Rodstein, referring to a seemingly innocuous rental application.\nIndeed, the necessary evil of paperwork that was once considered the stuff of secretaries now holds the potential to be just plain evil \u2014 rife with levels of risk that put it on the to-do lists of landlords and property managers.\nFraudulent applications have become an increasingly common form of theft that starts when a tenant who generally lacks the means or intention of paying rent gets into a lease and then uses eviction protections to take a free ride that can last for months.\nBeside the lost rent for however many months a bad tenant can game the system, landlords eventually bear the legal and administrative costs of an eviction, which\naverages $7,685\n, according to a\nsurvey\nby Snappt, an Ojai-based provider of fraud-prevention software.\nRodstein has plenty of company in finding new ways to\u00a0 avoid the toll of fraud. Advances in technology have made fake documents harder to detect and the problem more widespread. That\u2019s created an arms race of sorts, with service providers peddling software to uncover would-be cheats.\n\u201cLeasing fraud today has become far more sophisticated and brazen, using stolen or composite identities advertised for sale on\nsocial media\n\u2014 and often with no intent to ever pay rent,\u201d said Jay Parsons, who runs an eponymous consultancy that specializes in rental housing economics.\nThat brings in another, structural cost for landlords and property managers looking to stay ahead of the game.\nRodstein and North Oak Property Management now pay about $10 per applicant for fraud detection technology, forking over about $18,000 a year to service providers.\nFor developer and apartment building owner Balanciano Group, the measures cost around $25 per tenant application.\n\u201cAs fraud became more sophisticated, we implemented better tools, smarter systems and stronger safeguards,\u201d said Shawn Evenhaim, CEO of the Los Angeles-based Balanciano.\nSky Properties in Toluca Lake, has implemented a series of safeguards that includes tying credit reports to bank statements, reviewing utility bills, verifying employment directly, and running artificial intelligence-based ID verification.\nAll of that creates another layer of cost \u2014 because time is money and those steps take more time, according to Kari Negri, CEO of Sky Properties. A process that used to require one day now\u00a0 takes three, which means units sit vacant longer.\nWith a monthly rent of $3,500 that amounts to a $117 rental loss per day per unit.\nThe challenges of tenant-application fraud are clear and growing, according to landlords, property managers, security specialists, law enforcement and industry data.\nNationally, over 90 percent of rental housing operators dealt with some form of fraud in a 12-month period, a\nsurvey\nreleased by the National Multifamily Housing Council in January 2024 indicates.\nOf $4.2 million in bad debt that the average rental housing provider saw that year, a quarter could be attributed to fraudulent applications and the related failure to pay rent, per the association.\nFraud runs the gamut from old-school tactics such as providing phony references to new digital tricks like creating fake pay stubs.\nIt\u2019s the digital end that seems to have come out of a perfect storm that tracks back to the pandemic era. That\u2019s when virtual leasing processes reduced face-to-face interaction, financial hardship increased incentives to cheat, and technology made document fabrication easier than ever.\n\nRodstein recalls one incident when he couldn\u2019t evict a scammer due to tenant protections during Covid. Once those were lifted, North Oak served the man with a three-day notice, and he left in the middle of the night.\nCriminal networks are in the game, and will establish shell companies with legitimate registrations, websites and payroll systems that generate authentic-looking, but fraudulent pay stubs and bank statements, according to Daniel Berlind, founder of Snappt.\nThat level of sophistication requires looking at how long ago the business was created, what its website has been like over the years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about kind of creating this web and linking all of these data points together,\u201d Berlind said, like ID, documents, bank accounts and payroll.\nSmall landlords are particularly vulnerable, according to Dan Yukelson, executive director of the Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles.\n\u201cThe smaller owners are more likely to want to give a break to someone who seems nice and they do not follow strict screening criteria, and most importantly, do not have a way to get access to document fraud detection software,\u201d he said.\nSome of the biggest institutional landlords are on alert, too.\nCharleston, S.C.-based Greystar, which manages over $300 billion in real estate globally, reported that 12 to 15 percent of tenant applications are fraudulent.\nThe firm bears the costs of multiple applications to detect fraud, said Jamie Teabo, senior managing director of real estate. Greystar is fending off fraud for the most part, Teabo said, who notes success points up the virulence of the trend.\n\u201cThe percentages we report reflect only provable fraud,\u201d he said, \u201cmeaning confirmed cases identified through our verification processes, and do not include applicants who abandon the leasing process for fraud-related or other reasons.\u201d\nLandlords big and small will have to pay the freight on fraud prevention for the foreseeable future, according to Caren Maio, CEO of multifamily fraud prevention platform 100.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Wild West,\u201d Maio said. \u201cMaking, selling and using fake IDs is illegal, but many counterfeiters operate overseas and accept cryptocurrency or gift cards to evade U.S. law enforcement.\u201d\nAt the state level, a number of housing experts said there is no point in filing a complaint.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way any police agency in the state of California will go after a tenant, be it for even giving a counterfeit cashier\u2019s check, which is a federal crime,\u201d said attorney Dennis Block, who specializes in representing landlords on evictions. \u201cThey won\u2019t go after that. They won\u2019t go after tremendous damage to the property, which is vandalism, which is a felony in the state of California. They won\u2019t do \u2014 nothing.\u201d\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation reviews complaints on a national level, but prosecutions are rare, especially when the schemes have international ties, an agency spokesperson said.\n\u201cThe lost funds can\u2019t be recovered, and an arrest can\u2019t be made but we do urge reporting,\u201d she said.\nThe barrier of entry for fraudsters remains low as the feds take a passive approach to the problem.\nIdentity fraud can start at as little as $4 for a Social Security number on the dark web, and go up to $5,000 for a physical passport, according to an investigation by Atlas VPN based on Flashpoint Intelligence research findings between 2017 and 2019 cited by\nForbes\n.\nMeanwhile, the bad guys are moving on to the next big thing.\u201cIt used to be just folks doing this at their own home,\u201d said Berlind of Snappt. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s crime rings that are literally creating these entire fraudulent packages for folks \u2026 and, obviously, AI is certainly helping advance their missions.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Quarterra\nis bailing on its plans for a South Loop high-rise before starting construction.\nThe multifamily arm of national homebuilder Lennar listed its site at\n410 South Wabash Avenue\n, where it once aimed to build a 25-story, 344-unit rental tower, according to a marketing brochure\ncited\nby Crain\u2019s. CBRE broker Tom Svoboda is leading the marketing property.\nThe 27,400-square-foot parcel, near the Harold Washington Library, is offered without a list price. Lennar bought the site in 2019 for roughly $18.3 million and has already spent about $2 million prepping it for construction, CBRE said. Neither Lennar nor Quarterra returned the outlet\u2019s requests for comment on the listing.\nThe listing comes as Chicago\u2019s downtown apartment pipeline is on track to hit its lowest delivery volume in nearly three decades by the end of this year, despite high demand among renters.\nDevelopers are facing stubborn headwinds: high borrowing costs, escalating construction expenses and institutional investors pulling back from the city.\nThe scarcity of new supply could work in favor of those who can still get deals done.\n\nClass A downtown rents climbed 6.4 percent year over year in the second quarter, according to Integra Realty Resources, reflecting strong demand and limited competition.\nThe Quarterra site\u2019s DX-16 zoning \u2014 the city\u2019s densest \u2014 allows up to 399 market-rate units with no affordable housing requirement, since developments that don\u2019t need City Council zoning approval aren\u2019t subject to Chicago\u2019s 20 percent affordability mandate.\nThe Lennar affiliate sold a 5,200-unit portfolio to\nKKR last summer\nfor about $2.1 billion and has been shopping other holdings since late 2023, when Lennar executives said they were exploring offloading the company\u2019s 11,000-unit apartment portfolio. Quarterra also sold properties in River North and Oak Park last year.\nThe\nSouth Loop\nsite \u2014 zoned for residential, hotel, office, medical or retail use \u2014 offers potential skyline and lake views and proximity to Grant Park. The area has seen renewed investor interest, with DAC Developments and Melrose Ascension Capital recently landing financing for a nearby tower at 626 South Wabash and plans advancing for a Chicago Fire FC stadium a few blocks south.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

PSAI Realty Partners owns the two-story building, which spans 80,000 square feet in Showplace Square.\nThe company\u2019s space race mirrors its head count and valuation surge.

The design by\nDallas-based HKS\ntakes advantage of the tower\u2019s three existing lobbies, creating separate entrances for office tenants, residents and hotel guests.\n\u201cFortunately, the building lays out extraordinarily well for introducing multiple uses,\u201d Stream\u2019s Ramsey March told the outlet, adding that the plan is meant to bring \u201caround-the-clock activity\u201d back to a downtown long dominated by vacant office floors.\n\nThe 1987 tower, designed by\nPhillip Johnson\n, is half-leased, with Comerica Bank occupying much of the space. The bank\u2019s lease runs through 2028, but its future in the building is murky following its pending acquisition by Fifth Third Bank. Stream hopes Comerica stays put but isn\u2019t counting on it.\nHKS, which also designed AT&amp;T Stadium and Bass Performance Hall, plans to retain Johnson\u2019s signature arches and barrel vaults while modernizing interiors and public areas.\nA controversial piece of the redesign is an eight-story parking podium that would replace the existing banking hall and plaza along Ervay Street.\nStream reworked the structure after criticism from the city\u2019s Urban Design Peer Review Panel, adding a glass-and-fluted fa\u00e7ade and rooftop ballroom and pool deck. The podium will add about 400 spaces to the 700 already underground \u2014 a boost March said is essential to the site\u2019s long-term viability.\nStream hopes to start construction by next summer, pending City Council approval and additional tax increment financing. The two-year project will involve\nBalfour Beatty\nas general contractor and Mike Paneri Consulting on hotel strategy.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A Brooklyn lawmaker wants to reopen the city\u2019s door to Airbnb \u2014 at least partway.\nCouncilmember Mercedes Narcisse introduced a bill last week that would let owners of one- and two-family homes rent out their properties short-term without being present, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The deal would be a partial rollback of New York City\u2019s 2023 crackdown that effectively banned most Airbnb listings.\nThe proposal would allow up to four adult guests for stays shorter than 30 days.\nNarcisse\u2019s bill revives familiar political lines: support from lawmakers representing middle-class Black neighborhoods that rely on rental income and opposition from housing advocates who see Airbnb as deepening the housing crisis.\nThe bill\u2019s journey \u2014 introduced under one lawmaker, expanded by another, and now repackaged under a new number \u2014 underscores the tangled politics around short-term rentals in a city still grappling with affordability and tourism recovery.\nThe proposal mirrors a similar effort last year that was\ngutted\nafter fierce opposition from the hotel industry, tenant advocates and the influential Hotel and Gaming Trades Council.\nAirbnb\u2019s listings plunged by about 90 percent after the 2023 law took effect, decimating what had been one of its largest U.S. markets.\n\nAirbnb is not giving up on New York. The company spent nearly $4 million\nthis\nelection cycle\nto back City Council candidates and other political allies, though its influence may wane as new city leadership takes over in 2026.\nMichael Blaustein, Airbnb\u2019s Northeast Atlantic policy lead, called Narcisse\u2019s bill \u201cthe answer that countless outer-borough New Yorkers\u201d have sought, arguing it would help homeowners without hurting housing supply.\nOpponents, led by the hotel workers\u2019 union and tenant groups like Tenants Not Tourists, say any rollback risks siphoning apartments from the long-term rental market.\n\u201cAirbnb is once again trying to disguise their corporate greed as concern for New York families,\u201d said activist Whitney Hu, whose group receives HTC funding. The union rallied outside City Hall this month in anticipation of the legislative push.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Sotherly Hotels defaulted on its $49.2 million loan on a Hollywood resort near the ocean.\nThe debt on the 10-story DoubleTree Resort by Hilton Hollywood Beach with 311 keys, at 4000 South Ocean Drive, entered special servicing after missing the Oct. 1 due date to pay off the loan, according to Morningstar Credit and Sotherly\u2019s second quarter Securities and Exchange Commission filing.\nThe recent default comes as Sotherly has been facing past due and impending maturities on some of its hotel loans, prompting the firm to seek extensions from lenders or face hefty paydowns on principal amid a difficult refinancing market. Williamsburg, Virginia-based Sotherly is a publicly traded real estate investment trust led by CEO Dave Folsom.\nIts debt woes come amid a higher interest rate environment that\u2019s led some lenders to retrench from issuing new loans and refinancings while they work through forbearance agreements and maturity extensions on existing debt. Generally, banks, which are under strict federal oversight, have to maintain a\nminimum of capital\nand clean up delinquencies before issuing new loans.\nSotherly didn\u2019t return a request for comment. But its public filings shed light on how it\u2019s tackling its loan issues.\nOn Monday, the firm announced it will be acquired under a merger agreement with Memphis-based Kemmons Wilson Hospitality Partners and Los Angeles-based\nAscendant Capital Partners\n. Kemmons Wilson and Ascendant Capital will pay $2.25 per share for all outstanding Sotherly common stock, marking a 152.7 percent premium over Sotherly\u2019s share price on Friday. The deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter, is valued at $425 million,\nHotel Investment Today reported\n.\nIn its second quarter filing, Sotherly also outlined how it plans to tackle the Hollywood hotel maturity, saying it will ask the lender for an extension. If it\u2019s unable to push the maturity on the loan, it would have to seek refinancing, Sotherly said in the filing.\nBut to refinance, lenders often require a paydown of the principal to reduce their risk. In that case, Sotherly expects it would have to pay down the debt by up to $12.3 million \u201cbased on current and anticipated financial performance\u201d of the property, the firm said in its filing.\nSotherly\u2019s recent merger could help with the paydown. Under the agreement, Kemmons Wilson will immediately provide Sotherly with a $25 million revolving line of credit at a floating interest rate, according to public filings.\n\nThe DoubleTree in Hollywood is on a strip home to\nupscale\nhotels and condo-hotels sandwiched between the Atlantic Ocean and Intracoastal Waterway. Near the DoubleTree, Sotherly also owns the 57-key Lyfe Resort &amp; Residences at 4111 South Ocean Drive and 68-key\nHyde Beach House Resort &amp; Residences\nat 4010 South Ocean Drive. Both are\ncondo-hotels\n.\nSotherly bought the DoubleTree in Hollywood in 2007 for $74 million, records show. The building was completed in 1973 and renovated in 2000, 2008 and most recently in 2017, when Sotherly brought it under Hilton\u2019s DoubleTree flag.\nIn 2015, Sotherly scored a $57 million loan from Bank of America, bumping up the principal to $60 million later that year. Sotherly refinanced in 2021 with a group of lenders, including Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Merrill Lynch. The loan has an interest rate of 4.9 percent and the balance is down to $49.2 million, according to the SEC filing and Morningstar Credit.\nThe REIT has faced on-and-off debt woes on the Hollywood property for years. In December of last year, the property had a debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) for net cash flow, a reflection of a landlord\u2019s ability to meet debt obligations, of 0.97x, Morningstar Credit data shows. A DSCR of 1x is considered the breakeven threshold. The DSCR increased to 1.15x in June.\nThe loan first went into special servicing shortly after the onset of the pandemic in 2020, when mandatory lockdowns battered the hospitality industry. The loan exited special servicing in 2021, according to Morningstar Credit.\nIn 2023, the hotel was in trouble again because its performance declined below a threshold required by the lender, triggering a \u201ccash trap\u201d provision under the financing agreement that mandated all revenue be deposited into a cash management account for the benefit of the lender, according to this year\u2019s second quarter filing. This summer, the DoubleTree in Hollywood\u2019s performance improved, allowing it to exit the \u201ccash trap\u201d predicament.\nLast year, the hotel\u2019s occupancy averaged 68 percent, according to Morningstar Credit.\nThis summer, Sotherly also defaulted on a nearly $38 million loan on its 326-key Georgian Terrace hotel in Atlanta. The firm requested a one-year extension on the loan and if it\u2019s unsuccessful, it would have to refinance and expects to pay down about $4 million of the debt, according to its second quarter filing.\nNext year, the loans on Sotherly\u2019s DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport and The DeSoto in Savannah, Georgia, are scheduled to mature.\n",

        "content": "Another prominent downtown Chicago office building is hitting the market \u2014 this time just steps from Google\u2019s future home at the James R. Thompson Center \u2014 and debt maturity is at play.\nChicago-based Ameritus listed the office portion of 121 West Wacker Drive for sale, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n, citing marketing materials from Cushman &amp; Wakefield. Brokers Tom Sitz and Cody Hundertmark are leading the campaign to find a buyer for the 41-story, 426,000-square-foot property.\nAmeritus refinanced it in early 2022 with a $71.3 million loan from German lender\nDeutsche Pfandbriefbank\n. That loan has since matured, and sources told the outlet that the parties are working on a potential sale to resolve the debt.\nAmeritus Partner Jeb Scherb said the firm could pursue a recapitalization if a new investor comes aboard.\nThe Art Deco building \u2014 completed in 1929 and updated by Sterling Bay before Ameritus bought it for $118.5 million in 2018 \u2014 is now valued well below its last trade, given the punishing drop in downtown office demand and higher borrowing costs that have chilled investment activity.\n\nThe property\u2019s proximity to the redeveloped Riverwalk and Google\u2019s $280 million Thompson Center overhaul are catalysts for future leasing momentum, according to marketing materials.\nStill, any buyer would be wading into\nchoppy waters\n. The tower is just 63 percent leased, below the roughly 72 percent average across downtown Chicago, and far off the 90 percent occupancy rate it boasted when\nAmeritus\ntook ownership.\nThe listing adds to the growing list of downtown towers under stress as hybrid work reshapes the office landscape. Many landlords are working with lenders on discounted payoffs or joint sales as loans mature and valuations sink. Some buyers have swooped in to reposition buildings through new capital and leasing pushes, while others are content to wait for the market to stabilize before reinvesting.\nAmeritus\u2019\ntiming may also reflect its lender\u2019s shifting priorities. PBB announced in June that it plans to wind down its U.S. operations and refocus on European markets. A sale of 121 West Wacker could untether it from one of its last stateside positions: a well-maintained, riverfront asset surrounded by billions in new investment that could rebound faster than many of its distressed peers.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The 35 percent-leased property sits on a 6.3-acre parcel that brokers are marketing as a rare chance to reposition a struggling office asset or\nreimagine it\nentirely.\nThe site, which includes a structured parking garage, offers \u201cstrategic in-place zoning to minimize entitlement risk,\u201d Cushman\u2019s listing states, allowing redevelopment for multifamily, hotel or retail uses.\nCushman Director Matt Murphy told the outlet that the building presents a chance for investors to \u201clease up the property at a reset basis\u201d in a corridor with tight supply and strong fundamentals. Murphy said that comparable buildings in the vicinity are roughly 90 percent leased, and that the recently passed\nSenate Bill 840\n\u2014 which took effect Sept. 1 throughout Texas \u2014 could streamline residential conversions.\n\nBuilt in the late 1980s and renovated in 2015, the building counts Republic Title, Veritex Bank and Texas Health Surgery Center among its tenants.\nThe building has been recently plagued by financial distress. After falling into receivership in 2024, the property changed hands in April when an entity tied to real estate credit firm\nK-Star Asset Management\npicked it up at a foreclosure auction for $13.85 million.

CIBC USA provided the loan, according to a Newmark news release.\nJordan Roeschlaub and Nick Scribani were part of the Newmark team that represented the developers.\nSavio consists of three-story and five-story apartment buildings and rental townhomes. It offers studios, and one-bedroom to three-bedroom units, its website shows. Monthly rents range from $2,124 to $4,508.\nSavio is offering would-be tenants up to six weeks free, according to its website. That\u2019s consistent with landlords offering concessions to entice tenants amid an apartmen\nt supply overhang\nin South Florida.\nThe refinancing pays the balance of the\n$102 million\nconstruction loan the developers scored in 2022, also from CIBC, according to records.\nSavio is part of the larger mixed-use master-planned Parks at Delray project that will span 50 acres on the southwest corner of South Congress Avenue and Old Germantown Road.\n\nConstruction of the second phase, consisting of the 327-unit Skye, is expected to start this year, the release says. The project also could include commercial space such as retail and dining and a 1.5-acre park, according to media reports.\nThe developers paid a combined\n$33 million\nfor the Parks at Delray development assemblage in late 2018, including $20 million for the property for the project\u2019s first phase.\n13th Floor, led by Arnaud Karsenti, has developed some of Miami-Dade County\u2019s marquee condo towers and more recently has focused on public-private partnerships to redevelop transit stations. In May, the firm and Barings scored a\n$125 million\nconstruction loan for the 35-story, 432-unit Cadence apartment tower at 13th Floor\u2019s larger Link at Douglas mixed-use project adjacent to the Douglas Road Metrorail Station in Coconut Grove. 13th Floor leases the site from Miami-Dade.\nThe firm and the Ardid family\u2019s Key International are frequent partners. In their latest planned project, the duo want to develop an\n80-story condo\ntower behind First Miami Presbyterian Church at 609 Brickell Avenue in Miami\u2019s Brickell.\nKey International, led by brothers\nInigo and Diego Ardid\nand started by their father, Jose Ardid, traces its roots in condo and hotel development and expanded to rentals. In 2023, it proposed the 51-story, 750,000-square-foot\n848 Brickell\noffice tower at 848 Brickell Avenue in Miami.\nWexford is led by Joseph Jacobs and Philip Braunstein, according to its website. CDS International is entrepreneur Carl DeSantis\u2019 family office.\nSouth Florida refinancings have continued, despite\nhigher interest rates\nand some retrenching by lenders. This month, Crescent Heights scored a\n$238.4 million\nrefinancing for the 40-story, 588-unit Forma Miami completed last year at 2900 Biscayne Boulevard in Miami\u2019s Edgewater. Also this month, Resident Group scored\n$113.8 million\nto refinance its 32-story, 279-unit Metro Edgewater completed in 2023 at 452 Northeast 31st Street in Edgewater.\n",

        "content": "A home at an exclusive club on Geneva Lake sold for $7 million in an off-market transaction this month as real estate in the Wisconsin resort town shows no signs of slowing.\nThe 6,000 square-foot home at N1561 East Lakeside Lane in Linn, Wisconsin, is part of the South Shore Club community. Located on the former campus of the Northwestern Military Academy on the southwest end of the lake, the 40-acre development has about 40 homes that share a private beach.\nHomeowners also share docks and boats, with a staff that keeps boats fueled and maintained and will drive homeowners around the lake if requested. The club also has a pool, pickleball and tennis courts and other amenities, supported by a $2,350-per-month fee.\nThe convenience of South Shore Club\u2019s maintenance-free shared amenities has attracted buyers who sold their lakefront houses, said Tricia Forbeck, a Compass agent who represented the seller.\n\u201cEverything\u2019s at your fingertips, and you don\u2019t have to do anything,\u201d Forbeck said of the community.\nThe house is one of the priciest to sell around the lake in recent years. Another home in the same development\nsold in August for $10.1 million\nafter the buyer made an unsolicited offer to purchase the house.\nForbeck marketed the $7 million house privately for about 10 days and showed it to about eight potential buyers before receiving an offer. The offer came in mid-September, and the sale closed on Monday.\n\nThe buyer was represented by David Curry of Geneva Lakefront Realty, who did not respond to a request for comment.\nForbeck declined to identify the seller. Property records show the home was previously owned under a trust associated with Todd Mintz, who bought the property in 2018 for $2.7 million. Mintz paid about $31,800 in property taxes last year, county records show. Records that could identify the buyer are not yet available.\nForbeck said the seller put significant work into updating and improving the house, which needed maintenance when it was bought in 2018.\nAbout a 90 minute drive from Chicago, Lake Geneva is a favorite second-home location for city residents. Recent lakefront listings in the community have been grabbed up fast by eager buyers. Just this month, two other homes\nclosed for $8.7 million\nand\n$8.6 million\nafter going under contract in a matter of days.\nA handful of other\nlistings hit the market\nin September and found buyers in just a few days.\n\u201cDemand is over the top, and there\u2019s not much inventory,\u201d Forbeck said. \u201cThere\u2019s right now only two lakefronts on the market that aren\u2019t under contract.\u201d\n",

        "content": "China Construction Bank is seeking a buyer for a loan tied to a Class A office building in Oakland.\nThe Beijing-based financial institution is selling a $59 million loan secured by the 1333 Broadway building in downtown Oakland, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nThe debt amounts to about $242 per square foot.\nThe 10-story, 244,000-square-foot property has been owned by\nSwift Real Estate Partners\nsince 2019, when it purchased the building from CIM Group for $115 million, or $454 per square foot. That price was normal for the time, when offices were selling for as much as $550 per square foot.\nThe building is 74 percent occupied.\nDelta Dental is the building\u2019s anchor tenant\nwith 128,300 square feet, taking up more than half of the building\u2019s available space across two leases. Elsewhere in the building, a lease for 117,900 square feet is slated to expire in 2028 and a 24,500-square-foot lease is up in 2036.\nThe building sits on top of the 12th Street BART station and is adjacent to the Oakland City Center mixed-use development. On the ground floor, Walgreens has a 13,700-square-foot lease through October 2044. The pharmacy generated $14.8 million of contractual net operating income through May of this year.\n\nA buyer who purchases the debt could be in a position to acquire the property itself via a deed in lieu of foreclosure. In that situation, the property could sell at a significant loss. Other recent distress sales have amounted to $60 to $100 per square foot.\nEarlier this month, for example, 2001 Broadway sold to a private investor for $4.5 million, or $88 per square foot. In January, 1440 Broadway\nsold to Frontline Realty Capital\nfor $5.2 million, or $58 per square foot, after the lender seized ownership of the property from Tidewater Capital in July 2023.\nNonperforming debt tied to three Swift-owned office properties in California, Oregon and Washington also\nhit the market this month\n. That includes the 340,600-square-foot Mount Diablo Plaza in Walnut Creek.\nSwift also owns 1111 Broadway, a 568,000-square-foot building in downtown Oakland. It purchased the property in 2021 for $327.5 million, or $576 per square foot \u2014 one of the last office sales before building values took a post-pandemic nosedive.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Joshua Feldberger of Universal Abstract pleaded guilty to playing a minor role in a multimillion-dollar mortgage fraud case.\nThe Department of Justice charged Feldberger of Howell, New Jersey, in September 2024, along with Arthur Spitzer and Mendel Deutsch \u2014 both Toms River, New Jersey-based \u2014 over a scheme that allegedly allowed Spitzer to obtain loans for real estate properties he never owned.\nProsecutors alleged Spitzer orchestrated a ploy in 2019 and 2020 in which he identified properties in New Jersey or Brooklyn without mortgages or mortgages below the property\u2019s market value.\nSpitzer would then obtain loans on those properties he had no authority to take out loans on, according to the DOJ. He used fake documents with forged signatures to prove to lenders he controlled the properties. Spitzer allegedly took the proceeds from the loans and disbursed them in his accounts.\nSupporting part\nThe DOJ accused Feldberger of assisting in Spitzer and Deutsch\u2019s alleged scheme to fraudulently obtain a $4 million loan for properties on Malcolm X Boulevard in Brooklyn, which Spitzer did not own.\nFeldberger played an essential, but smaller, role in the alleged scheme because he owned a title and settlement company. That company was not identified in the indictment, but publicly available records link Feldberger to Lakewood-based Universal Abstract.\nAs part of the scheme, Spitzer needed to give the appearance of selling properties to Deutsch.\nIn order to make the sale appear legitimate, the DOJ alleges Feldberger worked with Spitzer to create a document to show that Spitzer had interest in the Malcolm X properties. These fake membership interests allowed Spitzer to purport to sell the properties to Deutsch.\nFeldberger also instructed an employee of his company to send a letter to a banker that claimed Deutsch had deposited funds into escrow accounts to purchase the Malcom X properties from Spitzer. As a result, the bank believed there was a legitimate sale and provided a $4 million loan to Deutsch.\nRemarkably, Deutsch and Spitzer then allegedly used the mortgage loan proceeds to fund Deutsch\u2019s down payment on the same properties. Another $100,000 of the loan proceeds was distributed to a relative of Feldberger, who used the money to repay a loan he made to Spitzer.\n\nIn a separate scheme, prosecutors allege Spitzer and Deutsch also fraudulently obtained $3 million in government loans intended for small businesses distressed by the pandemic.\nProsecutors initially charged Feldberger with one count of wire fraud, one count of bank fraud, one count of bank and wire fraud conspiracy, one count of aggravated identity theft and one count of making a false statement to a financial institution.\nBut Feldberger, represented by Zach Intrater of powerhouse criminal defense firm Agnifilo Intrater, pleaded guilty to just one count: bank fraud conspiracy. U.S. Judge Edward Kiel accepted Feldberger\u2019s plea on October 22.\nHe is scheduled to be sentenced in February in Camden, New Jersey. The maximum sentence for that offence is 30 years, though it\u2019s likely he will serve little to no jail time given his plea.\nA larger crackdown\nThe DOJ and the Federal Housing Finance Agency have been\ncracking down\non commercial mortgage fraud. Participants in these schemes often flipped properties or inflated rent rolls in order to extract higher loans from lenders. In many cases, properties were purchased with no equity at all.\nFor instance, Aron Puretz and his co-conspirators flipped an office complex in Troy, Michigan, to a related party at a higher price in order to secure an inflated $45 million loan from JPMorgan. Puretz was\nsentenced\nto five years in prison in 2024.\nThe case against Feldberger was the first time the Department of Justice brought charges against an executive or owner of a title or settlement company.\nAccording to the plea agreement, Feldberger\u2019s attorney claims his client only made $21,000 from the scheme, while prosecutors argued it was $100,000.\nThe DOJ will argue the loss caused by the scheme was more than $3.5 million but less than $9.5 million. Feldberger disputes the loss amount, according to the plea deal filed with the court.\n",

The new proposal calls for 769 apartments, 186 condos, 150,000 square feet of offices and a 180-key hotel, primarily concentrated around the Brightline stop at 101 Northwest 4th Street, according to a presentation at the Oct. 27 Boca Raton City Council Workshop.\nThe plan also calls for 15.4 acres of parks, recreation and civic areas, including a city hall, community center, community meeting pavilion, playground, basketball court, a tennis club and 10 tennis courts.\nIt also trims the developers\u2019 requested 99-year ground lease of public land from 31 acres to fewer than 8 acres.\n\nIt\u2019s a drastic reduction from Terra and Frisbie\u2019s initial plan that beat out Related Ross, Namdar Group and RocaPoint Partners for the bid. Designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox, it originally called for 1,129 residential units, 250,000 square feet of offices, 156,690 square feet of retail, 3,434 parking spaces and a 150-key hotel.\nSince winning the bid for the redevelopment, Terra and Frisbie have been dogged by controversy. Save Boca, an organization created by local activist Jon Pearlman, collected more than 7,000 signatures in a petition opposing the project, and called for a referendum on the redevelopment and amendments to the city\u2019s charter. Local attorney Ned Kimmelman\nfiled suit against Save Boca and Pearlman\nearlier this month, seeking an injunction against the group\u2019s referendum efforts. Court documents show Kimmelman withdrew his complaint on Oct. 15.\nThe city council agreed Sept. 9 to delay approval of the project until a voter referendum, which is currently slated for the March ballot.\nCoconut Grove-based Terra is led by\nDavid Martin\n, and Palm Beach-based Frisbie is led by Rob Frisbie and Cody Crowell. The developers are also partners on\na 1,145-unit multifamily project\nslated for the 16-acre site of the Palm Beach Kennel Club, which they bought for $20.9 million in June.",

        "content": "A striking slice of midcentury modernism on\nKenilworth\u2019s lakefront\nis for sale for the first time in nearly seven decades, in a test of whether design pedigree can outweigh development potential on the North Shore.\nThe heirs of Nydia Hohf listed the family\u2019s 1957 home at 303 Sheridan Road for $7 million, represented by\nBaird &amp; Warner\u2019s\nCarol Hunt, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The asking price amounts to $1,705 per square foot.\nThe 4,100-square-foot, four-bedroom, single-story residence sits on roughly three-quarters of an acre with 101 feet of\nLake Michigan\nfrontage and a seawall. It was designed by Keck &amp; Keck, the trailblazing modernist firm known for its passive solar innovations and precision detailing.\nThe Hohfs \u2014 Nydia and her husband, Dr. Robert Hohf \u2014 commissioned the Kecks to create a home centered around a Japanese-inspired atrium. With Plexiglas shoji screens, terra cotta flooring and clerestory windows, the space serves as a lightwell and a visual centerpiece.\nArchitectural historian Susan Benjamin, co-author of\nModern in the Middle: Chicago Houses 1929\u20131975\n, told the outlet that the home was historically significant for bringing modernism to tradition-bound Kenilworth.\nThe atrium\u2019s innovative design embodied Keck &amp; Keck\u2019s emphasis on daylight and flow, helping introduce a sleek, international sensibility to Chicago\u2019s North Shore. Keck &amp; Keck were active designing homes throughout Chicagoland from the 1930s through the 1970s.\n\nFrom the street, the house appears as a fortresslike wall of brick with a hidden entrance beneath a copper-accented porte cochere.\nInside, tongue-and-groove wood walls, built-in cabinetry and sliding partitions showcase the Kecks\u2019 craftsmanship. Floor-to-ceiling windows overlook a broad lawn to the lake, equipped with the firm\u2019s trademark operable louvers \u2014 an early precursor to climate control before air conditioning became standard.\nThough the home is largely intact, it needs modern upgrades to utilities, HVAC, the roof and kitchen. Only one of three bathrooms is fully functional, Hunt said. She and the sellers hope to find a preservation-minded buyer, but acknowledge that its size may tempt teardown developers.\nThat\u2019s a real risk in\nKenilworth\n, where lakefront teardowns are routine. In nearby Winnetka, multiple estates have been razed for record-setting rebuilds topping $12 million. A developer recently paid $6.8 million for a teardown site just blocks away.\n\u201cWe want to find someone who loves it for what it is,\u201d Steve Hohf, Robert and Nydia Hohf\u2019s son, told the outlet. \u201cBut once it\u2019s sold, we can\u2019t control what happens.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

It comes after a loan from\nCopia Lending\nthat originated in 2020 became delinquent.\nThe outstanding debt at the time of the foreclosure was $13.9 million. The size of the parcel wasn\u2019t reported.\nThe City of San Jose approved the development of a 24-story, 374-unit\ndevelopment\non the parcel. Shovels never got into the ground, however.\nThe proposed tower\u2019s developer was a group led by Alterra Worldwide and real estate executives Tony Bader and Mike Sarimsakci. They sought traditional financing and creative ways to secure funding to build the project.\n\nThe developers tried to attract investors in 2021 in an offbeat effort to raise $100 million. They used a\nsecurity token offering\n, or a digital system that would have allowed investors to buy small pieces of ownership in the development, to attempt to bring in investors. Nobody bit, and the site is vacant.\nAt one point, the building was occupied by an F.W. Woolworth Company department store.\nRoss Dress for Less\nalso had an outpost at the property, though it closed its doors at the First Street building in 2016. Following Ross\u2019 exit, the Local Color organization began using the site as a pop-up space for local artists.\nThe location presents a challenge to any development at the site, with properties tightly surrounding it on both sides and the narrowest part of the parcel stretching about 78 feet wide.\nIt\u2019s unclear what TDA plans to do with the empty building, including whether it will opt to buy the building outright. Any new development at the site could require the owner to acquire adjacent parcels to give it enough room.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Tensions are boiling over in Hutto after a Houston-based developer\u2019s high-profile mixed-use plan for the city\u2019s 250-acre Cottonwood tract collapsed in public fashion.\nMidway\nCEO and Chairman Bradley Freels slammed city officials for what he described as shifting rules and a lack of transparency after the Hutto Economic Development Corporation voted unanimously this month to end nearly two years of negotiations with the developer, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\n\u201cMidway fully embraced Hutto\u2019s Vision for the Cottonwood development, aiming to create an urban, walkable environment that caters to the existing suburban community while transitioning to higher land density and attracting a diverse workforce,\u201d Freels said in a letter to city officials.\nMidway was tapped in December 2023 to transform the prominent site, at Highway 79 and County Road 132, into a destination for retail, residential, office and parkland \u2014 a signature project meant to be comparable to Austin\u2019s Mueller district.\nBut the deal unraveled amid finger-pointing over delays, financing terms and alleged interference from city leaders.\nMayor Mike Snyder\n, who also sits on the Hutto EDC board, said the decision to cut ties came after what he called a \u201clack of progress.\u201d In a Facebook post, Snyder accused Midway of threatening to take its grievances to the Texas Attorney General\u2019s office and questioned the developer\u2019s partnerships.\n\u201cWhen a developer comes into Hutto, they need to do what\u2019s right by Hutto,\u201d Snyder wrote.\n\nFreels countered that Midway\u2019s hands were tied by city-related issues, including a planned highway overpass that stalled progress for nearly a year and delayed utility access until at least 2028. He also alleged that Snyder personally contacted key prospective tenants, undermining negotiations and violating the city\u2019s memorandum of understanding.\nThe dispute is the latest snag in Hutto\u2019s long quest to redevelop the Cottonwood property, once slated to be the headquarters of baseball scouting company\nPerfect Game\nbefore that deal imploded.\nMidway had proposed a six-phase buildout over several decades in the fast-growing suburb 30 miles northeast of Austin.\nFreels accused the city of failing to honor commitments to explore a municipal management district for infrastructure funding.\nHutto leaders now plan to relaunch the request for proposal process. EDC Chair Don Carlson said the focus will be on \u201cretail and commercial components\u201d that align with residents\u2019 needs.\nThe fallout leaves Hutto back at square one on one of Central Texas\u2019 most valuable undeveloped tracts, as the city races to keep pace with explosive population growth and the economic spillover from Samsung\u2019s $17 billion chip plant in nearby\nTaylor\n.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Merchants Bank of Indiana revealed it had fewer bad loans attributable to mortgage fraud in its most recent quarter.\nThe regional bank wrote down about $30 million in loans in the third quarter, citing declines in multifamily valuations and ongoing investigations into borrowers suspected of mortgage fraud.\nThis marked an improvement from last quarter, when Merchants revealed it wrote down $46.1 million in loans, making it\none of the first banks\nto acknowledge problems pertaining to an ongoing investigation into commercial mortgage fraud.\nMerchants reported its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday. They come during a time when regional banks are hoping to calm the market\u2019s nerves. A number of regional players\u2019 stock prices fell after banks Zions Bancorp and Western Alliance revealed earlier this month exposure to tens of millions of dollars in bad loans related to an alleged fraud scheme.\nThe bank stocks have since recovered and both Zions and Western Alliance reported no other credit issues in their earnings reports last week.\nBut Merchants Bancorp, with about $20 billion in assets, has exposure to multiple borrowers who are under investigation or pleaded guilty to mortgage fraud. In the most recent quarter, the bank said its write-downs related to nine relationships.\nNotably, the bank lent to Moshe Silber and Aron Puretz, both currently in prison for their role in unrelated mortgage fraud schemes. Merchants recently revealed in court filings it made seven loans to Silber and is owed $61 million related to properties backing those loans. The bank also lent to other troubled borrowers, including the late Mendel Steiner and Tzadik Management.\n\nMerchants\u2019 third-quarter earnings show both improvements as well as some lingering concerns about its loan book.\nOn the positive side, the bank reported a $31.0 million provision for credit losses on loans for the third quarter, a 43 percent decline from the second quarter of 2025.\nOn the negative side, Merchants still had nearly $30 million in write-downs in the third quarter, compared to $2.1 million in the same period last year.\nThe bank also saw an uptick in loan delinquencies, which increased to $336.2 million in the third quarter from $270 million the previous quarter. It claimed the uptick in delinquencies was primarily related to one unnamed multifamily relationship.\nDeciphering Merchants\u2019 exposure to bad landlords is challenging because it has completed billions of dollars in loan securitizations and credit risk transfers. The transactions are intended to reduce Merchants\u2019 credit risk.\nBut of the $336.2 million in delinquent loans, the bank said only $45.7 million are \u201cpartially protected under credit risk transfer transactions.\u201d In other words, a majority of the delinquent loans have not been transferred off the bank\u2019s balance sheet.\n\u201cAsset quality trends improved, with lower provision expenses and reduced criticized assets during the quarter,\u201d said Michael Dunlap, president and COO of Merchants, in a statement announcing its earnings. \u201cCombined with strong liquidity, core deposit growth, and effective capital management, we are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable performance and capitalize on additional market opportunities.\u201d\n",

        "content": "We are one week away from voting for a new mayor. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\nThe last few months have been packed with twists and turns in New York City\u2019s mayoral race. Mayor Eric Adams dropped his reelection bid last month and then endorsed Andrew Cuomo. Republican Curtis Sliwa refused to exit the race, despite prodding from some of his closest allies (including his boss at WABC radio, John Catsimatidis).\nCandidates have discussed their positions on various issues and made their case to voters.\nHere\u2019s a recap of where the candidates stand on key housing and real estate-related issues:\nHousing goals\nZohran Mamdani:\n200,000 new units over 10 years. He wants to add $70 billion to the city\u2019s 10-year capital plan, raising the additional funds on the municipal bond market. Doing so would require state lawmakers to sign off on lifting the cap on how much debt the city can issue. He also wants to expand the city\u2019s programs for financing low-income housing for seniors and housing for low- and extremely-low-income families.\nAndrew Cuomo:\n500,000, built or preserved, over 10 years. He has also said that within his first 100 days as mayor, he wants the Battery Park City Authority to bond out $1.5 billion, the value of the\nincrease\nin Brookfield\u2019s ground lease rent payments at Brookfield Place. He also wants the New York City Retirement Systems to increase its investments in affordable housing.\nCurtis Sliwa:\nHe hasn\u2019t released a unit target and has derided the Adams administration\u2019s City of Yes for Housing Opportunity. His housing plan focuses on getting tens of thousands of vacant rent-stabilized apartments back online and on converting vacant office space into housing.\nRent freeze\nMamdani:\nApproves and has promised to freeze rents for stabilized apartments for four years. This plan is complicated by reports that Mayor Eric Adams plans to appoint six new members to the Rent Guidelines Board before leaving office. Board appointees serve between two- and four-year terms, while the mayor can remove the body\u2019s chair at any time.\nMamdani told Hell Gate that despite these appointments, he\u2019s still confident that he can deliver on his promise \u2014\u00a0though he didn\u2019t specify how, other than saying that he plans to use his power as mayor.\nCuomo:\nDisapproves. During the\nfinal mayoral debate\n, he called Mamdani\u2019s promise \u201cpolitical blather.\u201d He has also pitched new rules (which would need state approval) that would limit who can occupy stabilized apartments after they become vacant. Under the rules (dubbed Zohran\u2019s Law in a nod to the fact that he lives in a stabilized apartment), when a regulated apartment becomes vacant, a landlord can only rent to someone who would spend at least 30 percent of their income on rent. Both tenant and landlord groups have criticized the proposal.\nSliwa:\nDisapproves and thinks large landlords should pay a vacancy tax for stabilized units.\nHousing ballot measures:\nMamdani:\nHasn\u2019t publicly\ntaken a position\n. Supporting the measures threatens to alienate the City Council and major unions that have\nendorsed\nhis campaign.\nCuomo:\nSupports\nSliwa:\nOpposes, calling the proposals \u201cCity of Yes on steroids.\u201d\nThe fate of the\nElizabeth Street Garden\nMamdani:\nSupports housing on the site. He told Hell Gate that he would evict the garden during his first year as mayor.\nCuomo:\nWould leave the garden in place. He posted on X on Tuesday that he would save \u201cthis precious garden\u201d and deliver affordable housing elsewhere.\n\nSliwa:\nHas long opposed developing the site.\nLocal Law 97\nMamdani:\nWants to eliminate the application fees for the property\ntax break J-51\nand to extend the incentive to help property owners pay for upgrades. Property owners have\ncriticized\nthe latest iteration of the program, which expires next year, saying that it doesn\u2019t provide an adequate benefit. Mamdani also wants the city to procure heat pumps and other green technology in bulk, so that property owners can buy them at affordable prices.\nCuomo:\nThinks the city needs to better phase in the law\u2019s requirements to address the fact that some property owners believe they are better off paying the fine for failing to comply rather than paying to upgrade their buildings.\nSliwa:\n\u201cTotally opposed\u201d to the law.\nProperty tax reform\nMamdani:\nSupports comprehensive reform and noted at an\nevent this month\nthat Tax Equity Now New York\u2019s legal challenge to NYC\u2019s property tax system could offer a path forward.\nCuomo:\nThinks TENNY\u2019s lawsuit is likely the only way that reform will happen.\nSliwa:\nSupports reform that lowers burden on multifamily buildings. His website indicates that he would \u201ccreate a fairer and more consistent assessment system that promotes transparency and predictability without punishing any class of property owner.\u201d It is unclear how.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nCity Council committees will vote on the Long Island City rezoning on Wednesday. Council member Julie Won\u2019s team wouldn\u2019t say on Tuesday if she has reached a deal with the administration, but an alert for tomorrow\u2019s votes reiterated that she would not vote yes unless the city makes a number of commitments. Where does this rezoning stand? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nThis month, it seemed that\na bill\nto set a construction wage floor for certain housing projects that receive public financing was heading to a vote this week. That isn\u2019t happening. Council member Carmen De La Rosa, the bill\u2019s sponsor, is in talks with the Department of Housing Preservation and Development on the measure. The agency\ntestified\nduring a hearing last year that the bill would cost $500 million if the city were to maintain its current level of housing production.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Comptroller Brad Lander is planning to challenge Rep. Dan Goldman next year,\nCity &amp; State reports\n. Council member Alexa Avil\u00e9s also plans to run for the seat in New York\u2019s 10th Congressional District.\n\u2014 Gov. Kathy Hochul is considering allocating state funds to send schoolchildren home with meals if food stamps are not sent out as scheduled on Nov. 1,\nGothamist reports\n. The Trump administration has said that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits will not be distributed on time due to the federal government shutdown.\n\u2014 Attorneys for President Trump filed a 96-page appeal on Tuesday, seeking to overturn his criminal conviction in New York on charges that he approved a scheme to falsify business records to hide hush-money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels, the\nNew York Times reports\n. Trump\u2019s legal team argues that the trial was \u201cfatally marred.\u201d\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$46.8 million\nfor a 6,942-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at 50 West 66th Street in Lincoln Square.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$5.9 million\nfor a 3,659-square-foot ground-floor retail space at 388 West Broadway in Soho.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$16.8 million\nfor a 7,190-square-foot condo unit at 1355 First Avenue in Lenox Hill. Stacey Alvarez with Compass is the listing agent.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 10,078-square-foot, eight-unit residential building at 79 Winthrop Street in Prospect Lefferts Gardens. The developer on the project is Aviad Rave of NextDoor Properties.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "After a scorching hot August, Manhattan lending cooled in September.\nThe city\u2019s top five deals totaled just over $2 billion \u2014 a roughly 50 percent drop from the previous month. Lenders doled out dollars across submarkets and asset classes, from a trophy office tower to mixed-use projects and a luxury condo development. Leading the pack was SL Green and Prudential\u2019s $1.4 billion refinancing of\n11 Madison Avenue\n. Rabsky Group\u2019s $320 million\nTribeca condo loan\ncame in a distant second.\nHere are September\u2019s top five Manhattan loans.\nTowering refi | $1.4B | Midtown South\nA consortium of banks\nled by Wells Fargo originated a $1.4 billion CMBS loan to refinance SL Green and Prudential Financial\u2019s office tower at 11 Madison Avenue. The five-year, fixed-rate loan replaced the previous $1.4 billion of debt on the property, which included a $1.075 billion senior mortgage and $325 million in mezzanine loans. The interest rate is expected to jump from 3.6 percent to 5.8 percent and the owners will need to put up a $52.5 million down payment to secure the loan, according to\nCrain\u2019s\n. SL Green acquired the full-block office property from the Sapir Organization and CIM Group in 2015 for $2.6 billion. A year after the acquisition, SL Green offloaded a\n40 percent stake\nto Prudential\u2019s PGIM Real Estate for $480 million.\nCondo cash | $320M | Tribeca\nG4 Capital Partners\nprovided a $320 million construction loan for Rabsky Group\u2019s ground-up condo project spanning an assemblage of lots on Franklin Street in Tribeca. Rabsky is planning a 280,000-square-foot condominium across three parcels: 65 Franklin Street, 59 Franklin Street and the corner site at 356 Broadway.\nPrevious projects\non the site by other developers had failed to get off the ground. Henry Bodek of Galaxy Capital arranged the deal.\n\nBroadway bankroll | $229M | Soho\nBarings\nprovided a $230 million loan to Northwood Investors to refinance the adjacent mixed-use office and retail buildings at 520 and 524 Broadway. Northwood acquired the properties in 2021\nfor $325 million\n, using a $227 million acquisition loan from Ares Commercial Real Estate. The pair of buildings, which have a combined 180,000 square feet of office space and 60,000 square feet of retail space, had been owned by the Propp family since 1987. A Newmark team including Jordan Roeschlaub and Nick Scribani arranged the deal.\nMultifamily money | $220M | Harlem\nBank Hapoalim\nprovided a $220 million loan for Artimus and Grid Group\u2019s new mixed-use development at 1440 Amsterdam Avenue in Harlem. The fresh financing replaced a $210 million construction loan from Valley National Bank. The 28-story building has 490 rental units, 147 of them affordable. Amenities include a gym, media room, outdoor terraces and coworking space. Grid Group purchased the land and air rights for the project from the New York City Housing Authority for $28 million in 2022. Artimus bought a\n50 percent stake\nin the project the following year for $17 million.\nSaks score | $145M | Midtown\nJPMorgan Chase\nprovided a $145 million loan for Vornado\u2019s purchase of the Charles Cohen-owned Manhattan office tower at\n623 Fifth Avenue\n. Steven Roth\u2019s real estate investment trust bought the 36-story tower above the flagship Saks Fifth Avenue store in September for $218 million. The building was 75 percent vacant and Vornado plans to redevelop it into a Class A boutique office building.\n",

        "content": "Community blowback scuttled a transitional housing effort slated for oceanfront property in Santa Monica.\nLos Angeles County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath, whose district includes the seaside enclave, ordered the termination of two interim housing facilities planned for former senior living facilities on Ocean Avenue, the Santa Monica Daily Press\nreported\n.\nThe county previously opted to\npause the projects\nbefore determining next steps. The reuse would have provided 49 units of supportive housing for people with serious mental illness and substance use disorders who are enrolled in the County\u2019s transitional housing program.\n\u201cWhen a project moves forward without community awareness, it erodes trust. In this case, that trust has been broken, and the community is right to be frustrated,\u201d Horvath said. \u201cThe lack of transparency and coordination in this process is unacceptable.\u201d\nThe housing was a few weeks away from opening and would\u2019ve been operated by the Venice-based nonprofit St. Joseph Center, with funding from the county through the state\u2019s Behavioral Health Bridge Housing Program. All residents would have been from Los Angeles\u2019 Westside, with at least 15 beds set aside for Santa Monica residents.\nHorvath directed the Department of Mental Health to work in tandem with St. Joseph Center and the\nCity of Santa Monica\nto find alternative sites that would meet the community\u2019s needs.\nShe also took it a step further, directing the county to \u201cunify all homelessness and behavioral health housing programs under one coordinated department to ensure clear leadership, consistent communication and accountability\u201d in addressing homelessness.\n\nLocal residents blasted the decision after what they viewed as insufficient community outreach.\nSanta Monica Mayor Lana Negrete joined that chorus, saying \u201ceverybody deserves to know what is happening in their community and to be able to voice their concern, and shouldn\u2019t be chastised or villainized for having a response or a fear.\u201d\nNegrete was pleased with Horvath\u2019s decision to force the development to relocate. \u201cWe should all be working together to build a framework for compassion and care that recognizes the financial and personal constraints facing cities across the state, and Santa Monica remains committed to these programs and the well-being of our community,\u201d Negrete said.\nProlific\nLos Angeles developer Leo Pustilnikov\nwasn\u2019t the owner of the Ocean Avenue properties but did have the option to purchase the property and was a part of the deal to locate housing facilities there. The county will still work with Pustilnikov to identify alternative locations.\nThe replacement housing doesn\u2019t have to be in the city limits of Santa Monica, but it must land in one of the Westside communities of Bel Air,\nBeverly Hills\n, Brentwood, Culver City, Ladera, Malibu, Mar Vista, Marina del Rey, Pacific Palisades, Palms, Playa del Rey, Santa Monica, Venice, West Los Angeles, Westchester or Westwood.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Nitya Capital hit a bump on the winding road\nto stabilize its value-add multifamily portfolio\n.\nA $66 million CMBS loan tied to two Nitya-owned properties, The Muse in Dallas and Eden Pointe in Houston, was transferred after a receiver was appointed, Morningstar Credit reported. Morningstar data also shows that the loan is delinquent, since Nitya hasn\u2019t completed its October payment.\nThe properties were collectively appraised at $127.4 million when the loan originated in October 2023. It matures in 2033. Servicer commentary provided by Morningstar first noted that The Muse \u201chas some life safety issues\u201d in January 2025. The note has appeared in each subsequent report.\nNitya Capital founder Swapnil Agarwal didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, but he did tell Multifamily Dive, which first\nreported\nthe transfer, that The Muse has \u201csome code violations\u201d and that the situation would be \u201cfully taken care of very shortly.\u201d\nThat 804-unit property at 3035 West Pentagon Parkway near Red Bird, was built in 1969 and last renovated in 2018. The 197-unit Eden Pointe, at 1307 Wilcrest Drive, was built in 1972 and renovated in 2020.\n\nNitya purchased The Muse in 2020 from Scott Everett\u2019s S2 Capital. It picked up Eden Pointe from Houston-based GWR Equities in 2017.\nIn 2023, Nitya partnered with Austin-based Texas Essential Housing Public Facility Corporation on a sale-leaseback of both properties, which provided property tax exemptions in exchange for keeping some units affordable.\nNotably, the sale-leasebacks are dated October 2023, after House Bill 2071 went into effect. The legislation tried to reform the public facility corporation program to ban the entities from doing deals outside of their jurisdictions. But, the Texas Essential Housing Public Facility Corporation, the target of the bill, continued to strike the deals based on a creative interpretation of the law, Houston Chronicle\nfound\n.\nThis loan update represents yet another twist in Nitya Capital\u2019s winding post-pandemic recovery.\nDebt was piling up for Swapnil Agarwal\u2019s Houston-based syndication firm, with Nitya\nunable to pay off a $356 million CMBS loan\nwhen it matured last year. But its luck changed when the firm landed a\n$700 million securitized refinancing deal\nin June.\n",

The seller is All Mobile Video, a studio and production company. The lease allows ABS the first right to purchase.\nABS has subleased the space back to All Mobile Video for four years. Randy Modell, a partner at ABS, and Steven Hornstock, a founder at the company, said they\u2019re thinking about redevelopment opportunities for after the lease expires.\nModell said the lot is zoned for 105,000 buildable square feet.\n\u201cWe can dream of a million uses in redevelopment ideas so that\u2019s what attracted us to it,\u201d said Hornstock.\nAll Mobile Video purchased the building in 2001. The company owns another studio on West 26th Street in Chelsea.\n\nEpisodic programs film elsewhere in the city but require more space and less technology, according to Duke.\nThe 46,000-square-foot building on West 57th Street is two stories and was built in 1910. Although in use as a studio, the building is classified as an office, according to city portals.\nEric Duke, president of All Mobile Video, said the studio specializes in live broadcast television. TV shows, including Apple\u2019s \u201cThe Problem with Jon Stewart\u201d and \u201cPatriot Act with Hasan Minaj\u201d have filmed at the West 57th Street soundstage, along with reunion episodes for Bravo programs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re able to continue our business, which is important to us,\u201d said Duke.\nThe property is across the street from the CBS Broadcast Center, owned by Paramount Global. The media conglomerate has been looking into redeveloping No. 524 and in July\nselected three\ndevelopers as finalists to lead the project, Bisnow originally\nreported\n.

        "content": "Steven Meiner rode into the Miami Beach mayor\u2019s office in 2023 after beating his former city commission colleague, Michael Gongora, in a run-off. Meiner made good on one of his campaign promises to make it a little harder for developers to seek more density for their projects.\nLast year, the city commission unanimously approved his legislation requiring six out of seven members of the elected body, including the mayor, to green-light any requests to exceed the city\u2019s maximum allowable\nfloor area ratio\n, or FAR, for new buildings. The commission also approved requiring developers to conduct a neighborhood impact assessment of any proposed FAR increases.\nYet, Meiner\u2019s four-year term as mayor has been marred by a few fumbles. In March, the mayor faced significant community backlash over his unsuccessful attempt to cancel a lease at a city-owned historic building at\n1130 Washington Avenue\nwith\nO Cinema\n. Meiner sought to terminate the agreement because the art house company refused to stop showings of a Gaza War documentary he claimed was offensive to Jewish people. Meiner also resigned from his job as a lawyer for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission following a human resources investigation that he sexually harassed three female colleagues and an intern, published reports state. The inquiry had just gotten underway when Meiner quit.\nDespite his efforts to reign in development and his controversies, Meiner has racked up strong financial support from real estate interests compared to city commissioner\nKristen Rosen Gonzalez\n, his only opponent in the upcoming Nov. 4 election.\nProminent developers like Russell Galbut, Terra\u2019s David Martin and JDS Development\u2019s Michael Stern can\u2019t donate to any Miami Beach candidates because they have pending business with the city, according to city records. But Miami Beach First, a political action committee backing Meiner, has collected $134,000 in contributions from well-known real estate and hospitality players in Miami and Miami Beach.\nMeiner, a non-party affiliated candidate, said in a statement that the financial backing from the real estate and hospitality industry reflects broad support for his reelection campaign.\n\u201cResidents and businesses recognize our success and want to keep the momentum going for Miami Beach,\u201d Meiner said.\nRosen Gonzalez, an outspoken advocate for historic preservation in Miami Beach, told\nThe Real Deal\nthat she is only raising money through her individual campaign account, and has not sought donations through a separate PAC. She said she is getting indirect support from groups such as Save, South Florida\u2019s longest-serving LGBTQ rights group, and the Miami-Dade Democratic Party.\nRosen Gonzalez also has picked up some support from restaurant and hotel owners in Miami Beach\u2019s Art Deco District.\n\u201cThey are very upset with the current state of the city,\u201d Rosen Gonzalez said. \u201cThey have more confidence in me than the mayor. When the streets are empty and hotels aren\u2019t full, that is a problem.\u201d\nTop Meiner donors\nLeading the charge for Meiner is Lennar co-CEO\nStuart Miller\n, who lives in Miami Beach and contributed $50,000 to Miami Beach First, campaign finance reports show. In April, the Federal Elections Commission dismissed complaints against Miller that alleged he attempted to conceal his identity when an entity he controls donated $125,000 in 2022 to a pair of committees backing Republican congressional candidates, including Miami congressman Carlos Gimenez.\n\nReal estate investor\nMichael Simkins\n, who lives in Miami Beach, donated $25,000 to Miami Beach First. Simkins\u2019 business partner, Marc Roberts, kicked in $10,000. Simkins and Roberts co-own E11even nightclub in downtown Miami, and they are also partners in a pair of E11even-branded condominium projects.\nDavid Grutman, founder of Miami Beach-based Groot Hospitality, pitched in $20,000 to Miami Beach First. In Miami Beach, Groot owns Papi Steak, a restaurant in the city\u2019s South of Fifth neighborhood, and co-owns Liv nightclub in billionaire Jeffrey Soffer\u2019s Fontainebleau Miami Beach resort. Grutman is also building a house at 2050 North Bay Road.\nMiami Beach First also notched $18,000 from Alex Kleyner, a Miami Beach-based real estate investor. Kleyner and his wife, Diana Ulis, own a waterfront development site in\nFort Lauderdale\nslated for a boutique condominium, as well as a\nCoral Gables\nproperty that was previously approved for a condo project. The couple acquired the sites from affiliates of Location Ventures, the defunct firm founded by disgraced developer Rishi Kapoor.\nIn addition, Meiner\u2019s committee received $10,000 each from Miami Beach developer Scott Robins and New York-based Naftali Group; as well as $5,000 each from Julia Grimes, managing partner of the Hilton Bentley Hotel South Beach, and entities managed by Miami Beach real estate investor Jimmy Resnick. Faena Hotel Miami Beach gave $2,000.\nOutside of Miami Beach First, Meiner\u2019s individual campaign received a combined $5,500 from entities tied to New York-based Infinity Real Estate, led by David Berg and Steve Kassin. Berg also donated $1,000, campaign reports show. In addition, an Infinity affiliate gave $1,000 to Rosen Gonzalez.\nLast month,\nInfinity\nacquired an assemblage on Miami Beach\u2019s Alton Road, including the former Epicure Gourmet Market &amp; Caf\u00e9 site, from developer Michael Shvo.\nMiami Beach First has collected a total of $540,745, compared to $97,727 via Meiner\u2019s individual campaign.\nTop Rosen Gonzalez donors\nIn her bid to unseat Meiner, Rosen Gonzalez has raised $146,806 for her individual campaign, with roughly $28,000 donated by real estate and hospitality professionals in Miami Beach. For instance, three members of the\nMirmelli family\n, which has significant real estate holdings in the city, each gave $1,000, the maximum allowed, campaign finance reports show.\nCatherine and Anthony Arrighi, owners of\nOcean\u2019s Ten\nrestaurant at 960 Ocean Drive, and two entities they manage each gave the maximum $1,000. Five affiliates of Miami Beach-based Think Hospitality, led by Shawn Vardi, donated a combined $5,000 to Rosen Gonzalez\u2019s individual campaign. Think owns seven Art Deco hotels in South Beach.\nAnother hotelier, Alan Lieberman, his wife Dianne Lieberman, and an entity he manages, gave a combined $3,000 to Rosen Gonzalez. Lieberman\u2019s\nSouth Beach Hotel Group\nowns 16 boutique hotels in the city. Five entities managed by Jim Cavanaugh, who owns a hotel at\n1360 Collins Avenue\n, each gave $1,000, according to campaign finance reports.\nAnd South Beach restaurants and bars Palace Bar, Mango\u2019s Tropical Cafe, Prime 112 and Big Pink each gave $1,000 to Rosen Gonzalez.",

        "content": "The wheels are falling off a hotel-to-apartment conversion in Columbus Circle.\nLender Parkview Financial filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection at the site of the Hudson Hotel, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The filing is not expected to affect the residents living at the property, according to Parkview.\nThe lender made the move to give itself a chance to recapitalize the building. It plans to continue pursuing the conversion of the 24-story building into 400 units of rental housing, though it will need to do so without the project\u2019s developer, CSC Real Estate.\nAfter CSC dodged a foreclosure in April, Parkview\nsued\nthe co-founders of the firm in July, alleging construction mismanagement. Parkview claimed Alberto and Salomon Smeke Saba failed to address issues with the city that would allow work to move forward on the project.\nThe Smekes claimed that they had already begun addressing the issues with the relevant city agency, the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development. Later in the month, it shot back at Parkview, alleging the lender didn\u2019t properly fund the project. The suit was discontinued the following month.\nIt\u2019s unclear why CSC abandoned the project. The firm confirmed its departure to Crain\u2019s, but did not go into detail about why it left Parkview as the lone company guiding the conversion.\n\nParkview\nlent\n$207 million for the\npurchase and redevelopment\nof the Hudson Hotel at 353 West 57th Street in May 2022. Construction began soon after, but a little more than a year later, problems arose, such as the fate of the renters in the hotel\u2019s 39 single-room occupancy units.\nThe hotel dates back to the 1920s when Anne Morgan, daughter of J. P. Morgan, led the development of the historic property. In previous lives, the building provided apartments for single women and served as the headquarters for television station WNET.\nIt became an 878-room hotel in 2000. It closed its doors in 2020 as a result of the pandemic.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "It took\nmore than a year\n, but BXP and the Moinian Group managed to refinance its debt at 3 Hudson Boulevard after falling into maturity default.\nJPMorgan Chase provided the developers with a $108 million loan at the site of a planned skyscraper in Hudson Yards, PincusCo\nreported\n. The debt replaced an $80 million loan originated by BXP, which matured last August and began ballooning with a hiked interest rate.\nThe outstanding balance reached $130.7 million as of the end of the third quarter, according to BXP\u2019s\nearnings report\nfiled with the SEC. That report disclosed BXP also provided a $50 million mezzanine loan alongside the refinancing.\nRepresentatives of BXP and the Moinian Group did not immediately respond to requests for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nBXP\noriginated the $80 million loan\nwhen it joined a venture with Moinian in 2018. BXP paid $46 million at closing to purchase its stake in the development site, along with a commitment to fund an additional $62 million if needed. Moinian purchased the full city block lot from Verizon in 2005 for $54 million.\nThe debt replaced a mortgage of the same amount from American General Life Insurance Company.\n\nConstruction began on a 2 million-square-foot development in 2017 and a\ndesign was released\nat the beginning of 2020, prior to the disclosure of the project\u2019s $2.6 billion price tag. But the project stalled in the wake of the pandemic and evident progress has been limited since.\nWhile looking for financing at 3 Hudson Boulevard, BXP kept plenty busy elsewhere on the East Coast. BXP and Delaware North this month\nsecured a $465 million refinancing\nloan for a portion of the Hub on Causeway in Boston.

        "content": "Scott Rechler restructured his\n\u201cdigital asset\u201d\nat\n75 Rockefeller Plaza\n\u2014 a major capital overhaul for a building that just three years ago seemed to have solved some of remote work\u2019s challenges.\nRXR brought in San Francisco-based hedge fund Farallon Capital Management as an investor in the 33-story tower that serves as RXR\u2019s headquarters, sources told\nThe Real Deal.\nFarallon\u2019s investment values the 627,000-square-foot tower at somewhere between $190 million and $200 million, according to a source familiar with the deal. That figure is significantly below the\n$260 million\nin debt that RXR put on the property in 2022, when it secured a refinancing from Bank of America and the Carlyle Group.\nAs part of this new deal, Rechler restructured the property\u2019s debt. One person familiar said the lenders agreed to split the mortgage into a primary A note and a B \u201chope note\u201d that will be repaid if the building performs well.\nThe deal is notable since Bank of America and Carlyle Group provided not that long ago, in the thick of the work-from-home era, when lenders were exercising extreme caution with office properties. Even deals from that period are in need of reworking today, as investors like Farrallon \u2014 and RXR with properties like\n590 Madison Avenue\n\u2014 are still looking for deep discounts on office properties.\nRechler described 75 Rock as a \u201cdigital asset\u201d that is 95 percent leased to companies like Merrill Lynch, American Girl and Guidehouse, with record rents exceeding $100 per square foot.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never wavered in our belief in New York City\u2019s office market, but we\u2019re disciplined about backing the right assets,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe recapitalization of 75 Rock reflects our conviction that premier properties in world-class locations will continue to outperform.\u201d\nThe RXR CEO said this marks the company\u2019s seventh recapitalization in the past two years across 9 million square feet under its \u201c3R\u201d strategy of resetting basis, restructuring debt and re-tenanting space.\nA representative for RXR declined to comment further on the deal. Representatives for Bank of America and Carlyle Group did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nA Newmark team led by Adam Spies and Adam Doneger served as RXR\u2019s capital advisor. JLL worked as the structuring advisor for the deal.\nThe restructuring illustrates just how uncertain the current office environment is, even for those who thought they had figured out how things were settling.\n\nIf the 2022 financing were done at a conservative loan-to-value of 60 percent, that would\u2019ve pegged the property then at around $433 million \u2014 meaning the valuation has dropped by more than half in just three years.\nAt the time, the deal was heralded as a sign of stability in the volatile Covid era.\n\u201cThe asset is the epitome of what lenders require in today\u2019s capital markets: A+ sponsorship, investment-grade tenancy and a superior capital-improvement program in proximity to tremendous lifestyle amenities,\u201d Newmark\u2019s Dustin Stolly, who negotiated the 2022 loan, said in a statement at the time.\nThe new pricemark is even farther off from the reported $500 million valuation RXR set when it bought the 99-year ground lease on 75 Rock in 2013. The company invested $150 million into renovating the tower in 2017.\nRechler announced a deal with Airbnb in 2019 to convert 10 floors in the building into 200 hotel-style units, but by the following year, the deal had fallen apart.\nWeWork had leased about 300,000 square feet in the building, roughly half of the skyscraper, but terminated that lease as part of its 2023 bankruptcy restructuring.\nFarallon was founded in 1986 by billionaire investor Tom Steyer, who stepped down in 2012 to focus on climate investments. Steyer \u2014 who ran in the Democratic presidential primary in 2020 \u2014 was a pioneer in merger arbitrage, investing in a corporate takeover target on the bet that a deal either will or won\u2019t go through.\nFarallon also has a significant real estate business. The company in 2023 raised its fourth real estate fund: a $650 million vehicle focused on U.S. opportunistic deals.\nIts property arm is run by Avner Husen, a former manager of Blackstone\u2019s BREIT investment trust, who joined Farallon last year. The hedge fund in July teamed up with Fetner Properties and MCB Real Estate to buy the 463-unit 240 Willoughby Street rental building in Fort Greene for\n$210 million\n.\nLast year, Farallon did another deal with Fetner, buying the 74-unit luxury rental building at 85 East End Avenue for\n$75 million\n.\n",

        "content": "Two of North Texas\u2019 biggest sports brands are now opponents off the ice and court.\nThe Dallas Mavericks sued the Dallas Stars over control of the\nAmerican Airlines Center\n, escalating tensions as both teams weigh their next moves on new arenas, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe Mavericks\u2019 ownership, led by Israeli-American billionaire Miriam Adelson and family through the Dallas Sports Group, filed suit Oct. 28 in Texas Business Court. The 253-page complaint accuses the Stars, owned by Canadian Tom Gagliardi of Northland Properties, of violating a partnership agreement tied to the entity that leases and operates the arena.\nThe Mavericks claim the Stars forfeited their ownership rights when they moved their corporate offices to Frisco in 2003, breaching a clause requiring both teams\u2019 headquarters to remain in Dallas.\nThe Mavs argue they exercised a contractual right this month to redeem the Stars\u2019 stake in the operating entities. The lawsuit accuses the Stars of retaliating by blocking arena maintenance and bonuses for employees, with one filing alleging the NHL club has \u201cheld the American Airlines Center hostage.\u201d\nThe Stars, represented by Winstead\u2019s Joshua Sandler, blasted the case as \u201can attempted hostile takeover\u201d designed to \u201cmarginalize the Dallas Stars to the role of a mere tenant.\u201d\nCEO Brad Alberts rejected claims the Stars backed out of a $300 million renovation deal,\ntelling\nthe Dallas Morning News the team had agreed to pay half the cost.\n\nThe legal crossfire lands as both franchises explore new arenas.\nThe Mavericks\n, under new ownership since Adelson\u2019s Las Vegas Sands Corporation\u2019s purchase of the\nfranchise\nlast year, have been scouting potential arena locations, specifically a 30- to 50-acre site by year\u2019s end.\nThe Stars have also acknowledged a search for a new home, with Collin County and Plano emerging as likely targets. A $1 billion arena could rise in\nPlano\nat the Shops at Willow Bend site if the Stars opt to relocate.\nThe teams\u2019 leases expire in 2031, and both insist games will continue as scheduled.\nThe dispute exposes a deeper power struggle over the future of Dallas\u2019 premier sports venue, and could reshape where the city\u2019s biggest teams call home next.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The City Council on Wednesday advanced the Long Island City rezoning, which is expected to create 14,700 new homes over the next decade.\nThe City Council Committee on Land Use and the Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises voted in favor of the rezoning after the Adams administration promised to invest $1.5 billion in the neighborhood. The project is expected to net 4,300 affordable apartments and 3.5 million square feet of new commercial space.\nThe Long Island City proposal now heads back to City Planning for review before going to the full Council for a final vote.\nThe Council made a number of changes to the proposal before approving it, including requiring deeper affordability and limiting building heights in some areas. Developers building in the Queens Plaza West area must set aside 20 percent of a project\u2019s units for households making an average of 40 percent of the area median income, with income bands capped at 130 percent AMI. That\u2019s the \u201cdeep affordability\u201d option under the city\u2019s Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program. As part of the\nCity of Yes for Housing Opportunity\n, that option was made available to the City Council as something it could mandate, rather than offer up alongside other affordability levels.\nFor months, City Council member Julie Won has withheld full-throated support of the rezoning, making clear that her buy-in hinged on City Hall making several commitments.\nThose commitments included \u201cmaximizing affordable housing on public and private sites,\u201d and creating a contiguous waterfront park by connecting Gantry Park to Queensbridge Park. She also wanted investments in sewer and stormwater management infrastructure, as well as new schools and open space beneath the Queensboro Bridge.\nThe city\u2019s financial commitment will help \u201cfund a connected waterfront,\u201d turn five acres under the bridge into green space, sewer upgrades, add more than 1,300 seats at new schools, as well as repairs to public housing at Queensbridge Houses.\nAs Mayor Eric Adams nears his exit from City Hall, his administration is\npoised\nto ultimately approve five neighborhood rezonings.\nThe City Council is expected to sign off on the Jamaica rezoning during its meeting on Wednesday, paving the way for nearly 12,000 apartments in the Queens neighborhood.\n\nThe approvals also come as City Council leadership ramps up its campaign against three ballot measures that threaten to weaken the body\u2019s influence over certain housing and land use actions. The Council has framed the questions as a power grab by City Hall that deprives members\u2019 leverage to increase affordability requirements and squeeze capital commitments from the city.\nIf Won opposed the rezoning, Council Speaker Adrienne Adams would have had an interesting choice. Adams has insisted that the Council does not always abide by member deference, the longstanding tradition of voting according to the local Council member\u2019s wishes on land use actions. Following member deference on Long Island City would provide fuel for proponents of the ballot measures.\nAt the same time, Won\u2019s demands for affordability and city investments are precisely the reasons the Council says it is trying to hold onto its power in the city\u2019s land use review process.\nDuring the subcommittee meeting, Won said the ballot measures would \u201cmake it impossible\u201d to negotiate at this level. Only one of the controversial ballot questions would apply to a rezoning of Long Island City\u2019s size. That measure would create a three-person appeals board that could override City Council decisions. The board doesn\u2019t preclude the Council from pushing for investments, but the board could arguably decrease the Council\u2019s leverage in negotiations over investments.\nWon has had\nclose calls\nbefore. In October 2022, the fate of Innovation QNS appeared precarious when Won\nemailed\nher colleagues and urged them to vote against the project. That may have signaled that the Council was prepared to override member deference. The Council ultimately\napproved\nthe project with deeper affordability, but the\ndevelopment team\nhas since broken up.\nWhile much of Long Island City has been rezoned over the last 30 years, the latest plan focuses on a 54-block area that has been left out of previous initiatives and is zoned for low- and medium- density manufacturing. The changes allow for more residential, as well as retail and light-industrial construction in the area.\nThe rezoning includes city-owned sites at\n44-36 Vernon Boulevard\n, 44-59 45th Avenue and 4-99 44th Drive, which will be transferred to developers.\nThe area has long been the subject of various development plans. The sites were once part of a megadevelopment envisioned by MAG Partners, Plaxall, Simon Baron Development and TF Cornerstone. That project, dubbed YourLIC, spanned 28 acres along the Anable Basin and would have resulted in more than a dozen buildings, with a mix of commercial, residential and community space. It also included the sites where Amazon once proposed building its new headquarters, before\nabandoning\nthat plan in 2019.\nThe city is also working to take over a site from Con Edison in an effort to create a contiguous waterfront between Gantry Plaza State Park and Queensbridge Park. This week, Won\naccused\nCon Edison of delaying the transfer, but thanked the company on Wednesday for working with the city.\n",

        "content": "A&amp;E Real Estate, one of New York City\u2019s largest private landlords, is facing foreclosure at 1080 Amsterdam Avenue, near Columbia University, after allegedly defaulting on a $29 million loan.\nApex Bank filed suit in Manhattan Supreme Court this week, accusing A&amp;E of missing three months of payments on the mortgage and violating other loan terms, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Apex is seeking to seize and sell the 20-story, 96-unit tower to recover the $28.3 million still owed, plus interest and fees.\nA&amp;E could also be liable for any shortfall if the property\u2019s sale doesn\u2019t cover the debt. The landlord, led by co-founder and CEO Douglas Eisenberg, has not yet responded in court but said it is working with the lender to reach a resolution that won\u2019t affect tenants.\nThe prewar building on West 113th Street, once staff housing for St. Luke\u2019s Hospital, includes a mix of market-rate and rent-stabilized apartments, an increasingly thorny combination since the 2019 rent law overhaul limited rent hikes and removed deregulation pathways.\nThat law has been blamed for squeezing returns and eroding valuations across the stabilized rental sector, where A&amp;E holds a large footprint.\n\nThe property last traded in 2022, when A&amp;E bought it from SL Green Realty for $42.7 million, financing the deal with the Signature Bank loan now in dispute. Following Signature\u2019s 2023 collapse, the note was transferred to an FDIC-linked entity and then to Apex last summer.\nStonehenge manages the building, where available units range from $4,500 to $8,400 a month.\nThe suit marks the latest sign of distress for the firm, which controls roughly 20,000 apartments citywide.\nEarlier this month, another lender sued over an alleged $165 million default tied to a dozen Queens apartment buildings. The company is also fighting a potential foreclosure at Harlem\u2019s 3,500-unit Riverton Square\nover a $506 million debt\n.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Facing foreclosure on its development site in Boca Raton, Penn-Florida Companies sold the 1-acre lot previously planned for an assisted living facility for $27 million.\nLed by Mark Gensheimer, Penn-Florida sold the vacant property at 375 East Royal Palm Road to Boca Raton-based SobelCo, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. SobelCo, a real estate development, investment, management and leasing firm led by Jeffrey Sobel, also purchased the adjacent 0.2-acre vacant site at 343 East Royal Palm Road for $3.1 million from an entity managed by McFillin of Delray Beach.\nIn total, SobelCo paid $30.1 million for 1.2 acres of developable land. It scored a $10 million loan from Goldman Sachs for the purchase, Vizzda records show.\nThe smaller lot at 343 East Royal Palm Road is approved for a four-unit luxury residential building with five stories and a rooftop, according to a marketing brochure.\nBoca Raton-based Penn-Florida had a long-pending plan for an upscale 193-unit assisted living facility on the site at 375 East Royal Palm Road. The Boca Raton Planning and Zoning Board\napproved\nthe project in 2017, and Penn-Florida subsequently demolished the two-story building that was on the site, records show. Construction of the assisted living facility never started.\nPenn-Florida had paid $1.2 million for the property and adjacent sites in 2005, according to records. In 2016, the firm borrowed $2.5 million on the land from City National Bank of Florida, bumping it to $5.7 million in three loan modification agreements in 2019, 2020 and 2023, according to records.\n\nLast year, City National Bank of Florida reassigned the loan to an affiliate of Miami Beach-based distressed debt investor Safe Harbor Equity, led by Rafael Serrano. Safe Harbor filed a foreclosure on the $5.7 million loan against Penn-Florida and Gensheimer, the loan\u2019s guarantor, alleging Penn-Florida defaulted on the 2024 maturity and the full loan balance is due.\nThe recent site sale resolved the pending foreclosure, according to court records. On Monday, a court filing by Palm Beach County Circuit Court Judge Carolyn Bell shows that Safe Harbor, Penn-Florida and Gensheimer submitted a letter notifying the court the case has been settled. Bell ordered the parties to file the proper dismissal papers, a procedural step.\nSobelCo andPenn-Florida didn\u2019t immediately return requests for comment.\nPenn-Florida\nhas been facing financial woes on several of its South Florida properties and projects. Its troubles come amid\nelevated interest rates\n, skyrocketing insurance and higher construction and labor costs. Many developers are stepping back from planned projects and\nlisting\ntheir sites for sale amid struggles to pay debt obligations on floating rate loans, or they are unable to refinance. Banks have generally\nretrenched\nfrom providing new loans.\nIn\nBoca Raton\n, Blackstone Mortgage Trust filed a\n$145 million\nUniform Commercial Code foreclosure against a Penn-Florida affiliate on its 366-unit 101 Via Mizner apartment building at 101 East Camino Real last year. Penn-Florida\u2019s affiliate filed for bankruptcy in January,\nwarding off\nthe scheduled foreclosure auction. In July, federal bankruptcy court Judge Erik Kimball approved a\n$235 million\nsale of the property to a joint venture between Penn-Florida and crowdfunding multifamily syndicator Grant Cardone.\n",

Wells Fargo Plaza sold for $40 million (a discount of more than $100 million); Symphony Towers went for about $48 million (which came out to an almost 70 percent price cut).\nDowntown San Diego appears to be faring better than downtown Los Angeles, by the numbers, but not by much. Downtown San Diego offices had a 29 percent vacancy rate in the third quarter, according to Colliers. That\u2019s compared to Downtown Los Angeles\u2019 33 percent vacancy rate, per a CBRE report.\nIrvine Company held these office buildings for decades before selling. The office world has changed immensely since the pandemic, and the offloading could represent a change in Bren\u2019s company, which still has a number of properties throughout San Diego County, in Del Mar and La Jolla, for instance.\n",

        "content": "Siri co-creator Dag Kittlaus took a loss on the sale of his downtown Chicago penthouse after 14 months searching for a buyer.\nThe 81st floor penthouse at the iconic\nAqua Tower\nsold Tuesday for nearly $3.2 million. The Jeanne Gang-designed tower features wavy concrete balconies that give the appearance of rippling water across the tower\u2019s surface.\nKittlaus was a co-founder of Siri, which Apple bought in 2010, as well as AI assistant company VIv Labs, which Samsung bought in 2016. He was the vice president of Samsung Mobile from 2016 to 2019, and is currently the CEO of Riva Health, a digital platform for cardiovascular health care that he co-founded.\nKittlaus bought the condo, with a balcony that features a wide open view of Lake Michigan, in 2018 for $3.8 million.\nIt went on the market\nin June 2024 for $5.3 million. The unit underwent several price cuts, dropping to $4.9 million, then $4.4 million, before settling at $3.25 million in September.\nThe 3,000 square-foot penthouse has four bedrooms and four bathrooms. The price worked out to $1,058 per-square-foot, which is comparable to recent similarly priced sales in newer buildings like the St. Regis Tower.\nAt least 14 other units in the condo have sold this year, according to public listing services, at prices ranging from $300,000 to $1.3 million. A two-story penthouse on the 80th and 81st floors has been for\nsale sporadically since 2015\n, with prices ranging from $4.3 million to $5 million. It has not been on the market since October 2023 but there is no record of it selling.\n@properties\u2019 Carrie McCormick, the unit\u2019s listing agent, said its pricing in the downtown market made it an attractive opportunity, along with the rare highrise view of the lake.\n\nDowntown Chicago\u2019s condo market has been struggling to come back since values plunged in the last few years as wealthy buyers went to the suburbs and fears about crime kept buyers out of the market.\nMichelle Welch, a Compass broker who represented the buyer, said the price was a big selling point for her client, who she declined to identify. The client was specifically looking for a unit with a great view, she said.\nProperty records show Kittlaus bought a condo at the St. Regis Tower at 363 East Wacker Drive in December 2024 for $3.8 million. He sold it to Michigan-based MJCRE LLC for $3.7 million in early October.\nThe sale reflects the new reality of the luxury downtown market in Chicago: Units will sell if they\u2019re priced to match the market, but if sellers are hoping for prices from 2021 or 2022, they\u2019ll have a hard time finding buyers. Welch said the penthouse at $5 million was out of her buyer\u2019s price range, but the lower price made it feasible to find a deal.\nMcCormick said buyers are\nstarting to show interest in downtown\nand finding value in the discount prices for luxury condos.\n\u201cBuyers are coming back to our market because the value is there,\u201d McCormick said. \u201cPeople recognize that. They\u2019re concentrating on key locations.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Forge Development\nis rethinking its plans for the former Pacific Steel Casting Company foundry in Berkeley.\nThe San Diego-based developer filed a new preliminary application with the city to partially renovate and reoccupy a portion of the the 10-acre property in West Berkeley, two years after proposing a life sciences campus on the site, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nThe new plan calls for demolishing some buildings and upgrading others totaling about 56,000 square feet. Part of that includes removing some decommissioned equipment and making structural improvements and repairs.\nThe company hasn\u2019t said whether it still plans life sciences use or is pivoting to manufacturing or light industrial tenants. The site plan suggests renovations won\u2019t immediately make the property ready for tenants to move in, as a separate tenant improvement application would come down the road.\nForge\u2019s initial plan, filed with the city in 2023, called for a 900,000-square-foot life sciences campus on the West Berkeley site. A formal application never materialized, though, likely due to\nincreasing vacancies in the life sciences market\n. San Diego-based life sciences developer IQHQ, for example,\npumped the brakes\non its planned $1.3 billion, 857,000-square-foot life sciences campus in South San Francisco.\nThe Pacific Steel foundry closed in 2018, and in 2021, the city of Berkeley began working to rezone the site to allow other uses like light manufacturing, research and development, industrial, offices and labs.\nForge\nbought the 10-acre site\n, which includes the Pacific Steel location and some neighboring parcels, for $49 million in 2023. The addresses include 1320 Second Street, 1314 Second Street and 1305 Eastshore Highway.\n\nForge isn\u2019t giving up on developing there just yet.\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t pulled away from investing in that property,\u201d Elizabeth Redman Cleveland of Berkeley\u2019s Office of Economic Development told the outlet.\nBerkeley\u2019s R&amp;D inventory has more than doubled since 2020, but venture capital and tenant demand have cooled. The city\u2019s lab vacancy hit 31.4 percent in the third quarter, leaving several new or entitled projects sitting idle, per CBRE.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\nKEY POINTS:\nForge Development is changing its plans for the former Pacific Steel Casting Company foundry in Berkeley, moving away from an initial proposal for a 900,000-square-foot life sciences campus.\nThe new preliminary application involves partially renovating and reoccupying a 56,000-square-foot portion of the 10-acre property, with demolitions and upgrades.\nThis shift comes amidst increasing vacancies in the life sciences market and a cooling of venture capital and tenant demand in Berkeley's R&amp;D inventory.\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s\nMagnificent Mile\nis regaining some of its old shine.\nAfter years of shuttered storefronts, shrinking crowds and pandemic-era malaise, shoppers and retailers are once again filling the city\u2019s most famous retail strip \u2014 a tentative sign of life for downtown\u2019s battered retail sector.\nVisits to the stretch of North Michigan Avenue are nearly back to pre-2020 levels, crime is trending lower, and a spate of new leases is reversing a multiyear slide in occupancy, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n.\nThe vacancy rate on the Mile has dipped to about 25 percent, down from 26 percent last year, according to Stone Real Estate. It\u2019s a modest improvement, but a notable one for a corridor still recovering from its worst downturn in decades.\nThe comeback has been fueled by lower rents and the return of marquee brands.\nCanada\u2019s Aritzia opened a 46,000-square-foot flagship late last year, filling a long-vacant box, while\nUniqlo\n\u2014 which abruptly exited in 2021 \u2014 will soon return with a 29,600-square-foot store. Experiential retail has also joined the mix: the\nHarry Potter Shop\ndebuted in April, and a magic-themed venue called The Hand &amp; The Eye is slated to open next spring.\n\u201cThe Avenue is still in recovery mode,\u201d Stone\u2019s John Vance told the outlet. \u201cBut it looks better.\u201d\n\nVance estimates average asking rents along Michigan Avenue are down roughly 24 percent from 2019, helping lure brands back to the strip.\nThe retail turnaround hasn\u2019t erased all the scars. Empty storefronts still punctuate the six-lane boulevard, and smash-and-grab thefts have kept crime top of mind, even as reported incidents in the 18th Police District have fallen 4 percent year-over-year. The Magnificent Mile Association now funds private security patrols to supplement city police presence.\nMeanwhile, the area\u2019s two urban malls \u2014\nWater Tower Place\nand the Shops at North Bridge \u2014 are question marks after both properties were surrendered to lenders. Pacific Life, which now owns North Bridge, plans renovations next year in a bid to reposition the property.\nCompared with peers like Manhattan\u2019s Fifth Avenue and Beverly Hills\u2019 Rodeo Drive, where vacancies are already below pre-pandemic levels, Chicago\u2019s recovery is still lagging. But brokers say momentum is shifting.\n\u201cThe rents had gotten so high, so frothy,\u201d said Newmark\u2019s Keely Polczynski. \u201cNow, supply and demand are finally starting to meet again.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Joseph Chetrit, one of New York\u2019s biggest dealmakers, was indicted Wednesday on felony charges of tenant harassment.\nHe joins his brother Meyer Chetrit, who was\nindicted last month\n, as a codefendant in the case. The district attorney has accused the Chetrits of harassing two septuagenarian tenants in a Chelsea loft building. He pleaded not guilty.\nJoseph is now one of the biggest names in the New York real estate industry to face criminal charges. The indictment underscores the\nManhattan district attorney\u2019s focus on prosecuting housing and real estate-related crimes\n.\nThe Chetrits allegedly left the two senior tenants at 111-117 West 26th Street without heat and without an elevator at different points during their tenancy, in the hopes of getting them to vacate the apartment. The tenants are in a rent-stabilized unit overseen by the city\u2019s Loft Board, which grants them special legal protections from harassment and rent increases.\nBoth Chetrits have been charged with two counts of harassment of a rent-regulated tenant, a felony that carries a maximum sentence of four years in prison.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even think you can find caselaw on these charges. It\u2019s an overextension of a law that\u2019s on the books,\u201d said Steven Metcalf, an attorney for Joseph. \u201cIt\u2019s targeted to Joe because of who he is.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m confident and I know that Joe is going to zealously defend against these charges,\u201d Metcalf added.\nMeyer Chetrit has been charged with two counts of harassment of a rent-regulated tenant, a felony that carries a maximum sentence of four years in prison.\n\nJeffrey Chartier, a defense attorney for Meyer, in September cast doubt on the facts of the case and said his client denies the allegations.\n\u201cRather than prosecute violent criminals that are plaguing the city, Bragg has again chosen to misapply the law in pursuit of a progressive political agenda,\u201d he said.\nAlvin Bragg, the Manhattan District Attorney,\ntold The Real Deal\nearlier this month that he hoped the real estate industry would be supportive of his efforts to target housing-related crimes.\n\u201cFor folks who are following the law, this evens the playing field,\u201d said Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\nJocelyn Stauber, head of the city\u2019s department of investigation, said she hopes the Chetrit indictment is a deterrent to other landlords.\n\u201cWe suspect there\u2019s more conduct like this out there, which we will be looking for,\u201d Strauber told TRD in September.\nThe Chetrits are a Jewish family originally from Morocco. Joseph\ncame to New York at 17\nand worked in the family textile import and export business before pivoting to real estate in the 1990s. The family began making big deals, becoming known for moving quickly, favoring cash sales and an untraditional style.\nJoseph is about 67 and Meyer is about 61.\n",

        "content": "As expected, the Federal Reserve made another move on Wednesday, cutting its\nbenchmark interest rate\nby a quarter point for the second time in less than two months.\nIt\u2019s the second time the central bank lowered the rate metric in six weeks and one of two cuts the bank previously signaled could be coming this year. In comments at the\ncentral bank\u2019s September meeting\n, authorities teased more interest rate cuts before the new year, though Fed chair Jerome Powell cast uncertainty over that in public comments on Wednesday.\n\u201cAvailable indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace,\u201d the Fed said in a statement, which also acknowledged that inflation remains elevated and the unemployment rate \u201cedged up but remained low through August.\u201d\nChair Jerome Powell said the meeting included \u201cstrongly differing views about how to proceed in December,\u201d when the agency was expected to make a third rate cut.\n\u201cA further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion,\u201d said Powell. \u201cFar from it.\u201d\nA majority of the Federal Open Market Committee voted for the quarter-point cut, but the decision was not unanimous. Stephen Miran, a Fed governor and close ally of President Donald Trump, voted for a larger cut, while another governor voted against any cuts altogether. It\u2019s uncommon for governors to vote on both sides of a decision.\n\u201cThe cut may not dramatically change transaction volume overnight, but it strengthens the sentiment that\u2019s been driving activity, proving that we\u2019re finally operating in a more constructive, stable environment,\u201d Herbert Smith Freehills Kramer\u2019s Dan Berman told\nBisnow\n.\n\nAfter hiking rates in the wake of the pandemic, the\nFed announced a half-point cut\nlast fall, only to hit the pause button in favor of efforts to control inflation.\nIn recent months, Trump and his allies made direct efforts to assert influence over the Fed.\nThe president himself has conducted a pressure campaign on the independent institution, attacking the chair and citing expensive renovations of the bank\u2019s headquarters as a potential means for removal.\nHe\u2019s also been\nattempting to fire one of the Fed\u2019s governors, Lisa Cook\n, for alleged mortgage fraud. That attempt\nhas been unsuccessful\nso far.\nMany in the real estate industry support rate cuts, bullish on how lower rates could spark commercial transactions and unlock supply in the housing market.\nThe average mortgage rate recently hit 6.19 percent, the lowest in more than a year, according to\nFreddie Mac\n. But mortgage rates don\u2019t directly correspond to the Fed\u2019s interest rates; they track more closely to the 10-year Treasury note.\n",

        "content": "A Coconut Grove commercial condo association wants the court-appointed receiver for disgraced developer Rishi Kapoor\u2019s defunct firm to cough up $650,000 in maintenance fees.\nIt\u2019s the latest dust-up surrounding an unfinished mixed-use project at\n3120-3170 Commodore Plaza\npreviously being developed by an affiliate of Location Ventures, the defunct Coral Gables-based firm founded by Kapoor in 2016. This month, Andrew Korge\u2019s Miami-based KOR Development canceled a year-old purchase agreement to buy the project and its ground lease for\n$28.2 million\n.\nBernice Lee\n, a Miami-based attorney who\u2019s the receiver for Location Ventures and its affiliates, has a back-up buyer lined up, but Commodore Centre Condominium Association claims the sale of the Commodore Plaza project is taking too long, according to an Oct. 14 motion filed in Miami federal court.\nLocation Ventures and its affiliates were placed into receivership last year due to a pending U.S. Securities and Exchange civil complaint against the company and Kapoor that alleges he misappropriated\n$93 million\nin investor funds meant for real estate projects.\nKapoor\n, who stepped down as Location Ventures CEO prior to the lawsuit, and the SEC settled in November, but the receiver is still selling company assets to pay creditors.\n\nLee and Commodore Centre Condominium Association\u2019s lawyer declined to comment.\nA\nLocation Ventures\naffiliate that owns 29 of 63 office condos at 3162 Commodore Plaza allegedly hasn\u2019t paid maintenance fees since 2023, the condo association\u2019s motion states. That year, the general contractor renovating the 29 office condos walked off the job, failing to properly secure the building and leaving it \u201cgrossly exposed to the elements,\u201d according to the condo association.\n\u201cTwo years plus of summer rains have poured into the building, causing substantial damage,\u201d the motion states. \u201cThe remaining members of the association have done their best to mitigate the damages. However, [Location Ventures] also stopped paying its maintenance assessments\u2026leaving the association with struggling finances.\u201d\nDespite having more than $2 million in \u201cunencumbered cash on hand\u201d and collecting rental income from one of the office condos that has a tenant, Lee has refused to pay the $650,000, the motion states. In addition, the association wants\nLocation Ventures\nto cover $250,000 needed to \u201cshore up\u201d the building at 3162 Commodore Plaza.\n\u201cWhile the association was hopeful the receiver\u2019s proposed sale would be approved and closed, almost a year has passed since [Lee] filed the sale motion,\u201d Commodore Centre\u2019s court filing states. \u201cAnd it is still not clear if the sale will either be approved or close, as the receiver has not changed course and sought the approval of a back-up bidder.\u201d",

        "content": "Another major brand is joining the growing pipeline of luxury condo developments in North Bay Village.\nCoconut Grove-based Related Group and New York-based Macklowe Properties are in talks with Ritz-Carlton to brand their planned waterfront project on Harbor Island, sources told\nThe Real Deal.\nThe developers\nsecured approval\nfor the two-tower development at two village commission meetings in July and September.\nCommissioners this summer passed a zoning ordinance that will allow the developers to build two 500-foot, 43-story waterfront towers at 8000 East Drive and 7946 East Drive via a special area plan. The project calls for 364 condos and nearly 800 parking spaces, or about two parking spaces per condo.\nRelated is\nleading development of the project\nvia its affiliate, Harbor Island Development Company. It will mark Macklowe\u2019s first development in South Florida.\nThe project will take up the northern tip of Harbor Island west. The developers also plan a 9,000-square-foot public park and a 42-slip private marina. Arquitectonica, led by Bernardo Fort Brescia, is the architect.\n\nA spokesperson for Marriott International, which owns the Ritz-Carlton brand, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Related also did not respond to a request for comment.\nRelated and Macklowe assembled more than 4.1 acres, which include the Biscayne Sea Club co-op and the Majestic Isle condo building. An entity linked to the developers paid $47.7 million for Biscayne Sea Club in late 2023 after a drawn-out and litigious sale process with the co-op community.\nThe developers also\nbought out unit owners\nat the Majestic Isle condo building, which had been declared unsafe. Last summer, a Related-Macklowe entity terminated the Majestic Isle condo association, a legal process required to eventually tear down and redevelop the site.\nRitz-Carlton has branded other luxury condo buildings in South Florida, including Ritz-Carlton Residences, Miami Beach and Ritz-Carlton Coconut Grove. A Ritz-Carlton Residences, South Beach is planned as well.\nNorth Bay Village is part of the branded residential boom taking over many of South Florida\u2019s coastal markets. Planned projects in the three-island town include Mikael Hamaoui\u2019s 30-story, 70-unit\nPagani-branded condo tower\nat 7940 West Drive, also on Harbor Island.\nThe Eichner family\u2019s New York and North Bay Village-based Continuum Company also plans two condo towers, a 200-key Continuum hotel and marina on 4.5 acres in North Bay Village that include the former Shucker\u2019s and Best Western property.\nThe largest project announced is the planned, phased, 14-acre redevelopment by the billionaire Ansin family\u2019s North Bay Village-based Sunbeam Properties into\n7.3 million square feet\nof development, which is expected to include roughly 2,000 residential units, 300 hotel keys and commercial space.\n",

The company was previously known for building market-rate co-living complexes.\nSoLa Impact just opened a project with 79 affordable units in South Los Angeles. They cost less than $275,000 per unit to build \u2014 quite a discount from the typical $1 million cost per unit to build in Los Angeles.\nFurther north in the San Fernando Valley, meanwhile, developer Passo is gearing up to open its first affordable housing complex, bringing it to life months ahead of schedule and under the planned budget.\nED1, enacted by\nMayor Karen Bass\nin late 2022, allows developers of 100 percent affordable housing projects to avoid the lengthy public hearings process and skip City Council votes. As a result, approval timelines for such projects have been cut down to a few weeks in most cases. The directive has trimmed approval timelines from nine months to just weeks, according to the mayor\u2019s office.\n\nAs of this August, developers had submitted proposals for 35,000 ED1-backed units and secured approvals for about 29,000 as of August. That eclipses the number of affordable housing submissions from 2020 to 2022 as well as the 17,556 units total housing units approved in L.A. during the last fiscal year.\n\u201cMarket-rate housing [construction] has been essentially canceled at this point,\u201d Chris Aiello, founding partner at Six Peak, told CoStar. \u201cVirtually no land makes sense from an investment perspective to build market rate.\u201d\nED1 has inspired similar ordinances across the country, including in Southern California. In early 2023, San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria signed an executive order requiring all 100 percent affordable housing projects to be reviewed and processed within 30 days. Last year, the city saw its highest number of housing permits since 2005.\nStill, L.A. is behind on\nits housing goals\n, namely the permitting of 456,643 new housing units by 2029, including 184,721 set aside for affordable housing.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

As a result, many companies have had to cut jobs and shave down their office and lab space to free up cash.\nThat has prompted some Bay Area biotech real estate developers to consider converting buildings for tech and other office tenants, delaying approved building projects or reducing land banks for planned developments.\n\nThis summer, for example, life sciences real estate developer\nIQHQ sought to delay construction\nof its $1.3 billion, 857,000-square-foot project in South San Francisco by a decade. Harvest Properties also\npressed pause\non a planned research and development campus in Emeryville amid the shaky market.\nIn 2022, Healthpeak sold a 30 percent stake in seven buildings at Point Grand spanning 400,000 square feet to an unidentified sovereign wealth fund, generating $126 million at closing.

        "content": "The City Council on Wednesday approved the rezoning of 230 blocks in Jamaica, Queens, marking the fourth neighborhood rezoning approved during the Adams administration.\nThe plan is expected to create 11,800 housing units, of which 4,200 will be permanently affordable. The rezoning  includes the largest Mandatory Inclusionary Housing zone \u2014\u00a0which requires a certain percentage of housing units to be set aside as affordable \u2014 ever mapped in the city.\nBefore approving the proposal, the City Council\nreduced\nthe density allowed in areas south of downtown Jamaica and removed portions of certain districts along the southern corridor from the rezoning. The changes cut 490 units off the city\u2019s housing projections for the rezoning, which were initially pegged at 12,300 units.\nThe Adams administration also committed $413 million for infrastructure, parks, schools and other improvements. That pledge is on top of the more than $300 million promised as part of the\nCity of Yes for Housing Opportunity\n.\n\nThe rezoning allows more residential development in an area where new construction has been stunted by low-density and manufacturing zoning, as well as parking requirements.\nThe City Council has approved four neighborhood rezonings during the Adams administration:\nMidtown South\n,\nAtlantic Avenue\n, areas around\nfour planned Metro-North stations in the Bronx\nand now Jamaica. On Wednesday, the City Council Committee on Land Use and the Subcommittee on Zoning and Franchises signed off on the Long Island City rezoning, which is expected to pave the way for 14,700 new homes over the next decade.\nSpeaker Adrienne Adams has pointed to the Jamaica rezoning as a prime example of why the City Council is critical to the city\u2019s land use review process. Specifically, Adams opposes three housing ballot measures aimed at streamlining the review process and getting around City Council members who consistently reject housing in their districts.\nThe only ballot question that would apply to this rezoning, however, is one that would create a three-person appeals board that could override City Council decisions. The board doesn\u2019t preclude the Council from pushing for investments, and it wouldn\u2019t be able to reverse any non-zoning-related elements of the Council\u2019s decisions on land use actions. Still, the board could decrease the Council\u2019s leverage in negotiations over investments because the Council members couldn\u2019t dangle rejection of a rezoning as effectively.\n",

Burk said the region\u2019s stable rent growth contrasts with rent declines in oversupplied Sun Belt markets.\nSchaumburg, known for its corporate base and retail density, lacks a walkable downtown \u2014 something\nVeridian\naims to create. The project builds on a trend of suburban \u201cmini-urban\u201d developments combining housing, dining and entertainment outside city centers.\n\n\u201cOut in the suburbs you\u2019re seeing a lot of growth because of this type of project, where people can get an actual urban-esque type experience but maybe not have to go all the way into the city,\u201d Burk said.\nThe financing adds another big-ticket deal to the lender\u2019s Chicago-area construction portfolio. Schaumburg officials also committed $47 million in public financing through a tax-increment financing district, according to the Daily Herald.\nUrbanStreet\nacquired the Motorola site in 2016, a year after the tech giant moved its headquarters downtown, leaving the suburban campus largely vacant.\nSince then, the developer has added the Element at Veridian apartments, attracted a\nTopGolf\nfacility in 2019 and drawn in homebuilder D.R. Horton, which is building 260 townhomes there. Manufacturing firm The Boler Cos also relocated its headquarters to Veridian.\nCompletion of the first phase is expected in 2027, marking a major step in turning one of the northwest suburbs\u2019 largest vacant corporate campuses into a dense, mixed-use district.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Horton said this week that high mortgage rates and sticker shock kept buyers on the sidelines through the end of its fiscal year, forcing the company to sweeten deals to keep sales moving, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nFor the three months ending Sept. 30, the nation\u2019s largest homebuilder\u2019s closings fell 1 percent to 23,368 homes, while full-year sales slipped 5 percent to 84,863.\nQuarterly revenue dropped 3.2 percent to $9.7 billion, and net income tumbled nearly 31 percent to $905 million. For the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, revenue was down 6.9 percent to $34.25 billion and profits sank roughly 25 percent to $3.62 billion.\nThe trend was reflected earlier this year, when D.R.

The Federal Reserve also trimmed its benchmark rate again Wednesday by another 25 basis points to 4 percent, which could give homebuyers a modest boost.\nStill, affordability remains the industry\u2019s central\nchallenge\n.

The unnamed firm plans to spend $450 million to build a robotic distribution center on the former San Antonio Raceway site, a 126-acre parcel that\u2019s been dormant since 2022.\nThe project caps nearly a year of negotiations and promises to reshape the city\u2019s industrial landscape. Cibolo projects a $9.8 million net gain in property tax revenue within the first decade, swelling to $121 million in cumulative city revenue over 30 years.\nThe site currently generates just $14,000 in annual property taxes \u2014 a figure officials say will be eclipsed in the project\u2019s first year of partial operations.\nAmazon\nconfirmed to the San Antonio\nExpress-News\nthat it is not the unnamed company referred to in the city\u2019s \u201cProject Theo\u201d announcement. Amazon is however pushing into using artificial intelligence and robots to help automate its next warehouses.\nThe facility will employ at least 425 full-time workers earning above the San Antonio metro\u2019s median wage, according to city documents. Economic Development Director Rick Vasquez told the council the complex will be run by robots and high-tech equipment, along with employee-operators to manage it all. He described the project as \u201cgenerational,\u201d crediting the city\u2019s partnership with\ngreater:SATX\n\u2014 a regional economic and workforce development organization \u2014 Guadalupe County and the Guadalupe Valley Electric Cooperative.\n\nCibolo has attracted logistical industries before. Aisin Corporation, a Fortune Global 500 firm partly owned by\nToyota\n, opened its $400 million AW Texas transmission plant there in 2021, and\nH-E-B\nlast year launched a $100 million e-commerce fulfillment center. Both projects have helped transform the once-sleepy suburb into a logistics and advanced manufacturing node along the Interstate 10 corridor.\nWhile city officials haven\u2019t confirmed the Fortune 500 firm\u2019s identity, the scale and automation focus have fueled speculation it could be a major retailer or e-commerce company betting on Central Texas\u2019 growing supply chain ecosystem.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The project is the second phase of \u201cAlloy Block,\u201d which includes the city\u2019s first all-electric skyscraper at 505 State Street and two public schools at 489 State Street. Along with the loan, Vistria Group, in its first ground-up development, infused $120 million in equity and took a majority stake in the project as a limited partner. Alloy, as general partner, is leading development and kicked in $40 million.\nBrooklyn bucks | $121M | Boerum Hill\nGoldman Sachs\nprovided a $121 million loan for Jacob Schwimmer\u2019s Boerum Hill multifamily building at 540 Atlantic Avenue. The fresh financing replaces a $63 million loan from Valley National Bank. Schwimmer\u2019s JCS Realty is nearing completion of the 159-unit building, which includes 48 units for residents at 130 percent of the area median income. Amenities include a gym, media room, business center and rooftop terrace.\nSelf-storage score | $120M | Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn\n\nAffinius Capital Management\nprovided a $120 million loan for a three-property self-storage portfolio owned by Prime Storage. Lender 3650 Capital provided an additional $36 million in mezzanine debt. The loan will be used to refinance 1260 Zerega Avenue in the Bronx, 31-07 20th Avenue in Queens and 1084 Rockaway Avenue in Brooklyn. The facilities were opened and renovated in 2016 and 2017, according to\nMulti-Housing News\n.\nWarehouse windfall | $105M | Bushwick\nDeutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs\nprovided a $105 million loan for Uovo\u2019s art storage facility at 105 Evergreen Avenue in Bushwick. The fresh financing replaced a $57.4 million loan from PNC Bank. Uovo bought the 112,000 square-foot industrial building in 2020 for $126 million and redeveloped it, according to\nCrain\u2019s\n. It\u2019s climate-controlled with 25-foot ceilings and multiple emergency generators. The new mortgage has a 10-year term and a 5.9 percent interest rate, Crain\u2019s reported, citing the ratings agency KBRA. Uovo will invest the proceeds from the refinancing back into the business, per Crain\u2019s.\nTerra trove | $74M | Long Island City\nMorgan Stanley\nprovided a $74 million loan for ZD Jasper Realty\u2019s new mixed-use development at 45-19 Davis Street in Long Island City. The fresh financing replaced a $29 million construction loan from Bank Hapoalim. The recently-completed 17-story development, known as Terra, has 122 units, ground-floor retail space and a parking garage.\n",

        "content": "Four neighborhood rezonings down, one more to go.\nThe City Council on Wednesday approved the Jamaica rezoning, which is projected to net nearly 12,000 apartments.\nIt also reached a deal on the Long Island City rezoning. The Adams administration pledged more than $1.5 billion in various investments to secure the local Council member\u2019s approval. That\nrezoning\n, which must go back to City Planning for review before going to a full City Council vote, is expected to result in 14,700 apartments.\nThe commitments made in these rezonings will be the purview of the next mayor, of course.\u00a0 As will those made as part of the other three neighborhood rezonings approved during the Adams administration.\nThe power dynamics around such rezonings may change considerably next year as well if three housing-related ballot proposals are approved. In a world where these rezonings are still pending and the ballot measures are approved, only one of the\nthree\nquestions would apply to these neighborhood rezonings. That measure would create a three-member appeals board that could reverse the City Council\u2019s rejection of a land-use action.\nCouncil leaders argue that this removes the chamber\u2019s ability to fight for the types of investments and concessions won as a condition of approval of rezonings like the ones in LIC and Jamaica. The board doesn\u2019t bar the Council from pushing for investments. The board could arguably decrease the Council\u2019s leverage in negotiations over investments because the Council members couldn\u2019t dangle rejection of a rezoning as effectively. At the same time, an administration that wants to have a good relationship with Council members is not just going to outright dismiss demands for funding to improve their districts. We will probably never know if the final version of these rezonings would look the same if the appeals board were in existence.\nOn Wednesday, the City Council also approved the\nredevelopment\nof the Kingsbridge Armory, a plan that calls for a 17,000-seat arena and the demolition of two buildings used by the state National Guard to make way for a new 16-story building that will net 500 affordable housing units.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nAre you going to the \u201cUnited for NYC\u201d fundraiser for Andrew Cuomo on Thursday? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nThe City Council\u2019s Committee on Consumer and Worker Protection will hold a hearing on Thursday on a bill introduced after the deadly shooting at\n345 Park Avenue\nin July. The Aland Etienne Safety and Security Act, named for one of the security guards killed, would set minimum wage and benefits for non-government security guards.\nDuring a press conference on Wednesday, City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, one of the bill\u2019s sponsors, said she expects the bill to pass.\n\u201cThe cost of living for folks who would literally die for you and me needs to be addressed,\u201d she said.\nThe Real Estate Board of New York believes the measure undermines wage negotiations between the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations and 32BJ SEIU and that the city\u2019s ability to set minimum wages is preempted by state law.\n\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\nMTA Chair Janno Lieber estimates that the cost of Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani\u2019s pledge to make city buses free would cost $1 billion,\nGothamist reports\n. Lieber told reporters on Wednesday that in the coming years, assuming the MTA cracked down on fare evasion, the agency would need to make up for $1 billion in lost revenue. Lieber also said the policy could add costs for the additional buses and depots that would be needed to accommodate higher demand.\n\u2014\nMy colleague Lilah Burke\nreports\nthat Joseph Chetrit was indicted on Wednesday on felony charges of tenant harassment.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$20.1 million\nfor a 4,492-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at 111 West 57th Street in the Plaza District. The Field Team at Sotheby\u2019s International Realty had the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$26.4 million\nfor a 5,612-square-foot vacant lot at 140 Fulton Street in FiDi. Bank Hapoalim sold the property after taking it over with 142 Fulton Street in\nJuly for $36.9 million\n. The new buyer was Rivington Company.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$20 million\nfor a 4,300-square-foot co-op at 990 Fifth Avenue on the Upper East Side. Christine Miller Martin, Kimberly Church and Hunter Hulshizer from Compass have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 10,383-square-foot, four-story residential building at 1013 Adee Avenue in Bronxwood. Jakov Saric filed the permit on behalf of Alex Stanaj.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "Warren Buffett famously said, \u201cOnly when the tide goes out do you discover who\u2019s been swimming naked.\u201d\nIn the same vein, the proposed City Charter revisions are revealing who is truly pro-housing and who has just been faking it.\nLast year, the City of Yes vote similarly\nexposed\ncertain politicians and neighborhoods as anti-housing, but we already knew who they were \u2014 people who oppose change to their neighborhoods, aka conservatives.\nOn the charter questions, being voted on through Nov. 4, it\u2019s the progressives\u2019 turn to show their true colors.\nCity Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and many of her colleagues have spent taxpayer money (illegally, in my view) to persuade New Yorkers to vote \u201cno\u201d on revisions that would help certain housing proposals to win approval even if the local Council member objects.\nThey claim\ntheir campaign\nis legal because it does not explicitly call for voting \u201cno.\u201d That\u2019s laughable, as any impartial reading of the Council\u2019s mailers would make clear. The Council should have raised private money to fight this battle, just as supporters of the ballot questions did.\nBut the greater problem is that self-proclaimed progressives oppose\nthese measures\nin the first place.\nSome, like Brooklyn Council member Lincoln Restler, have tried to split the baby.\nRestler supports a \u201cyes\u201d vote on Questions 2 and 3 but\nnot on Question 4\n. Opponents of Question 4 argue that Council members can use their de facto\nveto power\nto force developers to make projects more affordable or add community benefits. Allowing developers to appeal rejections to a three-person panel would undermine that, they say.\nReality check: The appeals panel (the mayor, borough president and Council speaker) would also have a strong incentive to deliver community benefits.\nBut they would also have an incentive to help a wider area \u2014 the borough or the city \u2014 because they have broader constituencies.\nThe housing crisis was caused in part by allowing hyperlocal self-interest to prevail over the greater good. Maybe Restler would resist this pressure and make the right call on project approvals, but his colleagues and successors\nmight not\n.\nThe evidence is the housing crisis itself. The current land-use approval framework, known as Ulurp,\nhasn\u2019t worked\n. After 35 years, it\u2019s time to try something new.\n\nThe appeals panel, from which applicants would need two votes out of three, would be less vulnerable to local opposition like the Jamaica Campaign Against Rezoning. JCARE fears new housing from the\nupzoning\nof the Queens neighborhood would push out people of color, despite a\nlarge body of research\nto the contrary.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely heartbreaking,\u201d co-founder Nafisa Mahmud told NY1. \u201cThe vast majority of the housing will not be affordable for working-class families, and in many cases, middle-class families, so the people here are looking at the real risk of displacement.\u201d\nThe article\u2019s\nvery next sentence\nwas: Over the past decade, the average rent in Jamaica rose from $1,681 to $2,737, an increase of 63 percent.\nHow\u2019s that no-rezoning strategy working out, Nafisa?\nShe might say the average rent would have increased even more if new housing had been built, because most new units are priced above the average.\nBut if her concern is current Jamaica tenants, her question should be: What effect would new supply have on their rents?\nRealPage just reported that nationwide, the average advertised rent last quarter decreased for only the second time since 2009. It\u2019s not because landlords suddenly became charitable. Rather, a wave of new apartments gave tenants more options, forcing owners to reduce rents to fill units.\nSome tenants renewing leases, in turn, got concessions to match the rents on vacant units in their buildings. \u201cRenters in good standing aren\u2019t going to want to pay more than someone coming in the front door,\u201d housing expert Jay Parsons\ntweeted\n.\nThis won\u2019t last, however. Rents will go back up because multifamily development is projected to slump, giving landlords the upper hand \u2014 especially in New York City.\n\u201cGround-up starts have slowed nationwide, and New York\u2019s pipeline has contracted more than any other major U.S. market,\u201d wrote\nLev Mavashev\n, founder and principal of New York brokerage Alpha Realty. \u201cThat means fewer completions through 2026 and 2027 \u2014 less new competition, a firmer rent floor, and a more predictable revenue base for multifamily assets.\u201d\nNafisa Mahmud is never going to see Mavashev\u2019s piece, or this one, or any of the research on the\neffect of new supply\n. Perhaps Restler will, but even if he does, Council members will always be more influenced by their loudest constituents, such as Mahmud.\nThat\u2019s why a \u201cyes\u201d vote on the charter questions is crucial. But if nothing else, like a receding tide, the proposals have separated New Yorkers who really want to make housing affordable from those who have nothing below their waist.\n",

        "content": "Los Angeles\u2019 multifamily market\nlost a bit of steam in the third quarter, but a bounceback might not be far off.\nOccupancy dipped 40 basis points year-over-year, while rents fell 0.2 percent from the previous quarter, the L.A. Business Journal\nreported\n, citing Colliers.\nStill, L.A. is a bright spot, outperforming nationwide trends. The city boasts 94.9 percent occupancy compared to the 93.2 percent across the country.\nThe slight decrease in occupancy and rent prices stem from shifts in supply and demand rather than \u201cfundamental issues,\u201d Colliers senior executive vice president Kitty Wallace told the outlet. Wallace also cited slowing population growth due to this year\u2019s immigration raids in Los Angeles.\nThe downtown and Hollywood/Mid-Wilshire submarkets are partially to blame for the sagging numbers.\nDowntown occupancy\nis at 92.9 percent, while Hollywood/Mid-Wilshire is at 94.1 percent. Before the pandemic, developers were on a construction spree downtown in the hope of revitalizing the commercial center. But overbuilding, combined with the hollowing-out of downtown post-pandemic, became a problem.\n\u201cDowntown didn\u2019t come back, and all that brand new product had just been built,\u201d Wallace said, noting that Hollywood and\nKoreatown\nfaced similar trends over the past decade.\nThat glut could soon reverse, however. With\ndevelopers wary of Measure ULA\n\u2019s transfer tax and uncertain financing conditions, an impending construction cooldown could tighten the market.\n\nDevelopers started 2,554 units last quarter, while 5,292 units were delivered.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good amount for Los Angeles,\u201d Wallace said, though she noted that it isn\u2019t sustainable as developers pause or shelve entitled projects.\nDevelopers shouldn\u2019t be afraid of putting shovels in dirt right now, however.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re breaking ground today, and your property is [delivered] in 18 months to 36 months, that\u2019s when all of the entitlements that are here are going to be usurped,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd for all those units, the absorption will have taken place, and our rents are going to skyrocket.\u201d\nUnder its\nhousing element\n, the City of Los Angeles must plan for 456,643 new housing units by 2029, with 184,721 of those being designated for affordable housing.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Attorneys for the two parties did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nRockwood assumed $26.7 million in commercial mortgage-backed securities debt when it purchased the building, according to the lawsuit. Rialto alleged that Rockwood defaulted when the debt matured in May and owes about $25 million.\nCushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s Brian Holmes was named receiver, to take possession of the 12-story, 50,000 square foot office building at 225 Santa Monica Boulevard, which has a view of the Pacific Ocean and was once the city\u2019s tallest building.\nRockwood consented to the appointment of a receiver in hopes of a sale, according to court documents. The landlord previously expressed interest in transferring the title back to the lender, according to servicer commentary via Morningstar Credit.\n\nRockwood, a subsidiary of Colliers International, recently became part of an investment management platform,\nHarrison Street Asset Management\n, which has $100 billion in assets.\nSpecial servicers act on behalf of lenders.

        "content": "New York City residents are voting on half a dozen ballot measures this election season.\nOne of those is a statewide question about land use in Adirondack Park, the largest publicly protected area in the lower 48.\nTechnically, the state is seeking a constitutional amendment to allow the use of 323 acres of parkland for winter sports.\nHowever, what the language of the proposal does not say is that the 323 acres have already been developed. The question is whether voters will bring the area into compliance, allow improvements, and approve the purchase of 2,500 acres of forest land to make up for it.\n\u201cThis was a good settlement to what could have been a lawsuit,\u201d said John Sheehan, communications director of the nonprofit organization Adirondack Council.\nAdirondack Park is a mixture of public and private lands within a six-million-acre boundary. As enshrined in New York\u2019s constitution, the public lands can\u2019t be developed without a constitutional amendment.\nThe state\u2019s Olympic Regional Development Association, which manages the infrastructure that was built for the 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, allegedly violated that law. The agency built Nordic ski trails and a lodge at Mt Van Hoevenberg in preparation for national and world competitions.\n\u201cWe had a choice. We could sue and stop the authority from holding those games. And put a big hole in the Lake Placid community\u2019s tourism budget that year and put a lot of people out of work,\u201d Sheehan said. \u201cOr we could ask for essentially a settlement that would be for the authority to get a constitutional amendment.\u201d\nEnvironmental protectionist groups in the Adirondacks, including the Adirondack Council, have backed the proposal and Gov. Kathy Hochul has signed legislation implementing the constitutional amendment if it should pass.\n\nIt\u2019s so far unclear where the 2,500 acres could be added. The legislature will need to approve any purchase and addition.\nThe state is looking at several parcels elsewhere in Essex County, where Mt Van Hoevenberg is located, Sheehan said. The county abuts Lake Champlain and contains almost all of the state\u2019s 46 high peaks. Converting private to state land would likely open up further recreation opportunities, Sheehan said, since state lands would likely have trails built or opened.\nThe state is looking to buy parcels elsewhere for Adirondack Park, such as\n32,000 acres of forest\nin Hamilton County, once part of the estate of socialite Marylou Whitney. But Sheehan said he believes the administration will seek to purchase land in Essex County, nearby the original 323 acres, to comply with the amendment.\nThe county is a study in economic contrasts, Sheehan said, with wealthy residents and investment in Lake Placid, but economic deprivation elsewhere.\nThe ballot measure does not have truly mobilized opposition. Sheehan said the biggest hurdle for the environmental groups supporting the provision is helping the public understand what it means.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not quite clear that this is a remediation from the language on the ballot,\u201d Sheehan said. \u201cOur biggest concern is that people, out of legitimate care for the Adirondacks, would vote no because they\u2019re suspicious of what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The real estate industry is no stranger to dynastic rule.\nFor as long as real estate has been a business, it\u2019s been a family business. That tradition is alive and well with the Frisbie Group, a Palm Beach homegrown development firm where nearly every employee shares the same last name. Decades into the business, the family is aiming for the big leagues, partnering on billion-dollar projects with Terra, Related Ross and the Trump-affiliated 1789 Capital.\nThey are leveling up their projects, taking bigger swings with higher price tags, but the risk rises with the reward. Some of their most ambitious endeavors have been dogged by controversy and litigation.\nThe shift to more prodigious projects follows a quiet transition of power within their ranks in recent years. The first generation of Frisbies have handed over the reins to the second generation. Rob Frisbie Jr. and his brother-in-law, Cody Crowell, now stand at the helm of a small firm with growing ambitions in South Florida and beyond.\nThe first generation, brothers Rob Sr., Rick and Dave Frisbie, got their start in real estate renovating Boston brownstones while they were students at Harvard University in the 1970s. After separate careers, they launched the Frisbie Group in Palm Beach in 1996, starting with spec projects on the island and West Palm Beach\u2019s downtown Clematis corridor.\nDecades into the business, they were well positioned for Florida\u2019s pandemic boom. In 2020, they completed Via Flagler, a 1.3-acre mixed-use development at 221 Royal Poinciana Way in Palm Beach that includes restaurants, retail, offices and six condominiums.\nThat same year, they completed an oceanfront resort in the Florida Keys, called Islands of Islamorada, which the family sold last in 2024 for\n$72 million\n. They bought the site for $7 million in 2017. In 2021, the Frisbies completed an oceanfront four-unit townhome development at 456 South Ocean Boulevard in Palm Beach. They acquired the site for $26.3 million in 2018, and sold all the units of the project for $109.1 million, records show.\nTheir current pipeline includes\na 1,145-unit multifamily project\nslated for the former Palm Beach Kennel Club, for which they\u2019ve partnered with David Martin\u2019s Coconut Grove-based firm Terra. They also acquired 5,300 acres near Mountain City, Tennessee, where the family is planning a resort dubbed the Forge Mountain Club,\nWHJL\nreported last year.\nIt hasn\u2019t been all smooth sailing, though. The Frisbies partnered with Hines in 2021 to buy a West Palm Beach development site where they planned a Robert A.M. Stern-designed luxury condo project. Two Roads Development sued Frisbie, alleging it was cut out of the deal. They reached\na settlement\nin 2023, and a month later Frisbie and Hines sold the project to Related Companies for\n$194.6 million\n. Suzanne Frisbie, Dave Frisbie\u2019s wife and a top agent with the Corcoran Group, stayed on to oversee sales for the project.\nLast year, the Frisbies proposed a 37-unit residential project for a 5.8-acre Palm Beach site owned by Wells Fargo. The property is mostly occupied by an underutilized surface parking lot, and the Frisbies sought to build luxury homes in the style of Palm Beach\u2019s celebrated early architects, John Volk, Maurice Fatio, Addison Mizner, Howard Major and Marion Sims Wyeth.\nPaul Leone, the longtime CEO of the Breakers and a partner with the Frisbies on Via Flagler, defended their proposal for the site.\n\u201cWho better to develop it than the Frisbie Group, our neighbors with a track record,\u201d he said at a town meeting last year.\nNonetheless, the Frisbies endured hours of withering criticism and accusations from their island neighbors in public meetings, and the project\nultimately stalled out\n.\nIn Boca Raton, the Frisbies are partners with Terra on One Boca, a contentious redevelopment of the city\u2019s government campus. An opposition group has gathered more than 7,000 resident signatures to fight the project, and approval now rests on a referendum slated for March of next year. Earlier this week, the partners announced\nscaled back plans\nwith fewer residential units and office space.\n\u201cIt can be scary, and it can be overwhelming to work on projects that do build a consensus,\u201d Rob Frisbie Jr. said. \u201c[It\u2019s] not easy.\u201d\nBut the sting of public backlash can be soothed by other projects with deep-pocketed backers. The firm is partnering with\n1789 Capital\n, an \u201canti-woke\u201d investment firm led by co-founders Omeed Malik and Chris Buskirk. Donald Trump Jr. is also a partner in 1789, which is launching a $1 billion fund with the Frisbies to focus on South Florida real estate projects.\nHere\u2019s a look at the Frisbie family:\nThe Founding Generation\nRobert Frisbie Sr.\nLineage: Married to Kim Frisbie, father to Robert Frisbie Jr., Frances Frisbie Criddle, Katie Frisbie Crowell and Richard (Rick) D.W.

        "content": "New York\u2019s real estate leaders are already\nover the 421a replacement\n.\nMAG Partners chief executive officer MaryAnne Gilmartin said the 485x program \u201creally needs to be reconsidered,\u201d calling it unworkable for ground-up developers at a\nCrain\u2019s\nand REBNY event this week.\n\u201cMy hope is that we don\u2019t live with this program for a decade,\u201d she said.\nThe 485x incentive, included in last year\u2019s state budget, was designed to revive affordable housing production after the 421a program expired in 2022. But its $40-per-hour minimum wage requirement on projects of 100 units or more triggered a\nflood of 99-unit proposals\nacross the city, a workaround industry insiders say could cripple large-scale development.\nCBRE\u2019s Mary Ann Tighe, who heads the firm\u2019s New York tri-state operations, put the numbers on stark display: New York would need 5,050 99-unit buildings to meet its housing needs.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an impulse to treat development punitively,\u201d she said, pushing back on critics who see tax incentives as handouts. \u201cWe have to stop thinking about tax incentives as some kind of giveaway.\u201d\n\nHousing starts for market-rate units\ndropped\n67 percent from last year, falling from an average of 7,500 per quarter since 2021 to 2,500 this year, according to CoStar data from last month. The pipeline of units under construction declined over the same period from 71,000 to 47,000, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n.\nThe frustration underscores the widening gap between Albany\u2019s political calculus and developers\u2019 financial realities. The wage mandate, combined with rising construction and financing costs, effectively sidelines much of the private sector from building rental housing at scale.\nStill, optimism flickered. Tighe said Manhattan leasing and foot traffic have bounced back sharply since the pandemic, and that the city\u2019s underlying resilience remains intact.\nTighe and Gilmartin\u2019s comments also fed into a broader theme of the event: the need for structural fixes to facilitate housing construction.\nSome panelists endorsed the charter reform\nballot measures\nthat could loosen the City Council\u2019s grip over project approvals, arguing they might finally let pro-housing members vote \u201cyes\u201d without fear of backlash.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Former AbbVie CFO Bill Chase sold his\nWilmette\nhouse for $6 million this week, drawing a sale well over the asking price.\nThe 7,000 square-foot house at 819 Chestnut Avenue, with five bedrooms and five-and-a-half bathrooms, is one of the priciest homes to sell in Wilmette in recent years. It sold Oct. 28 for $857 per square foot and nearly $700,000 over its asking price, indicating there was significant competition for the property.\nChase and his wife, Jenifer Chase, bought the house in 2013 for $1.7 million.\nJoanne Hudson with Compass, who represented the sellers, and Ali Murphy of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, who represented the buyer, did not respond to requests for comment.\nChase was an executive at AbbVie, the North Chicago-based pharmaceutical company, from 2011 to 2019, and he held finance roles at Abbott Laboratories, the company AbbVie spun off from, starting in 1989, according to LinkedIn.\nHe serves on the board of directors for three health technology companies: Cancer research company GRAIL, genome editing company Intellia Therapeutics, and pharmaceutical research company Parexel.\n\nThe home was built in the 1920s and underwent renovations in 2015 significant enough that it was considered new construction by the City of Wilmette, according to the listing. The outdoor area includes a pool and expansive patios. Located just off Sheridan Road, the property is a short walk from Lake Michigan.\nThe house sold fast, hitting the market Sept. 1 and going under contract less than a week later. Property records that could indicate the buyer are not yet available.\nThe $6 million price tag makes it the second-most expensive home sale in Wilmette in the last year, according to listing services. Another Chestnut Avenue mansion a few blocks away sold for just over $6 million in August.\nWilmette\u2019s most-expensive home sales include a house on Linden Avenue that sold for $9 million in 2008, then again for $7.5 million in 2017. Chicago Cubs co-owner Laura Ricketts spent $6.5 million on a house on Sheridan Road in 2010 in Wilmette that\nspurred a legal battle\n.\nDemand has been strong for\nNorth Shore luxury properties\nthis year. Sales in towns like Winnetka, Lake Forest and Kenilworth have brought in record prices and\ndriven the Chicagoland luxury market\n.\nThis week, a Kenilworth home sold for $14.5 million, the second-highest price for a home resale in Chicagoland history. The record was set just weeks ago, when a mansion in Winnetka sold for $31.5 million.\n",

        "content": "Lawmakers and the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office on Thursday announced a new bill upgrading criminal penalties for tenant harassment.\nThe legislation would create a new class D felony, aggravated harassment of a rent-regulated tenant. Harassment of rent-stabilized tenants is already a class E felony, but the bill would upgrade the charges if landlords harass tenants systematically across multiple buildings or have already been found guilty of the lesser charge.\nThe new legislation underscores the district attorney\u2019s focus on targeting landlords. The announcement came one day after the indictment of one of New York\u2019s best-known real estate dealmakers, adding\nJoseph Chetrit to a case against his brother Meyer\n. Authorities previously claimed the tenant harassment charges against the members of the influential Manhattan\nreal estate family\nover a Chelsea building they own would boost a broader enforcement push against landlords.\n\u201cWe need more tools to hold bad actors accountable,\u201d said Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg at a press conference Thursday. \u201cWe want to have a chilling effect.\u201d\nThe lower felony charge, which requires harassment of at least two tenants, already carries a\u00a0 maximum prison time of four years, although this is very rarely applied. The higher felony charge carries a maximum prison time of seven years.\nAfter tenant-friendly legislation passed in 2019, landlords have had less financial incentive to harass tenants in rent-stabilized apartments. Previously, property owners were able to legally raise the rent if there was a vacancy, which encouraged landlords to pursue turnover.\nThe Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019\nended that incentive\n. But tenants\u2019 lawyers say they haven\u2019t seen a drop-off in harassment.\n\nState Senator Brian Kavanagh, who represents parts of lower Manhattan, acknowledged this at a press conference, saying the legislature had closed opportunities for landlords to raise rents on rent-regulated units.\n\u201cMost landlords are doing the right thing, they\u2019re following the law,\u201d Kavanagh said. \u201cBut unfortunately there are landlords in this city who often systematically try to go after their tenants and try to push them out of their homes.\u201d\nAssemblymember Micah Lasher, who represents the Upper West Side, said landlords should see higher penalties if they harass tenants at a higher scale.\nLasher mentioned at the press conference that his first New York apartment rented after graduating from college was owned by\nSteve Croman\n, a now-infamous landlord who would later face allegations that he harassed tenants across multiple buildings. Lasher said he sued Croman in small claims court to recover his security deposit after an electrical fire made the apartment uninhabitable. Croman eventually\npaid $8 million in tenant restitution\nafter a broad civil case and went to prison for several months related to mortgage and tax fraud.\n\u201cThat was a case where it became clear that the civil and administrative remedies are not enough,\u201d said Lasher, who previously served as chief of staff in the state attorney general\u2019s office.\nTenant harassment has made headlines recently as Bragg pursues tenant harassment charges against Joseph and Meyer Chetrit. The two brothers have been indicted related to allegations that they harassed two senior citizens and left them in unsafe conditions to encourage them to leave their rent-stabilized apartments. Lawyers for the Chetrits deny the allegations and have said the prosecution is pursuing a political agenda.\n\u201cWhere power asymmetries exist, criminal activity follows,\u201d Bragg said.\n",

The store was supposed to open at 1658 Westheimer Road in Houston\u2019s\nMontrose\nneighborhood.\nThe loan matured in January, the bank claims, but it entered into a forbearance agreement with The Salty Donut in May, pushing the maturity date back to June 27. The loan still hasn\u2019t been paid off, according to the bank.\nSalty Donut founders Andres Rodriguez and Amanda Pizarro personally guaranteed the loan, the lawsuit claims. City National Bank is asking the court to require repayment as well as interest and attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\n\u201cOur client is at their wits end with this, knowing this is an entity that has several locations, not only in Texas, but here in Florida and in other states,\u201d Vega said.\nThe Salty Donut didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment in time for publication.\nPizarro and Rodriguez\nfounded the company in 2014\n, originally operating out of a vintage camper, and\nopened the first brick-and-mortar store\nin Miami\u2019s Wynwood neighborhood in 2016. The company operates 21 locations, in Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Dallas, Denver, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, Tampa and West Palm Beach, with additional stores coming soon to Atlanta, Charlotte and the Washington, D.C. area, according to the Salty Donut\u2019s website.\nHouston is missing from the list. So is the Houston suburb of Katy, where a Salty Donut outpost opened late last year. The company opened its first Houston location at the 34-acre mixed-use development LaCenterra, at 23501 Cinco Ranch Boulevard, about 30 miles west of downtown Houston.\n",

The complex features 12 studio apartments, 120 one-bedroom units and 36 two-bedroom units.\nThe purchase of the View complex increases the company\u2019s L.A. presence in the face of decreasing apartment construction across the city due to rising material and labor costs and lengthy approval processes.\n\u201cThe lack of apartment construction has caused major supply constraints which will cause continued upward pressure on rents,\u201d Concord CEO Reuben Robin said. \u201cThat, coupled with the massive infrastructure investment due to upcoming events like the\nOlympics\nand World Cup, keeps us feeling good about the imminent growth in this city.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A cornerstone of Mayor Daniel Lurie\u2019s housing plan is too optimistic, according to the City Controller\u2019s Office\nIt is meant to create tens of thousands of homes over the next two decades through a\nrezoning push\n, but even in the best-case scenario, the city will fall far short of that.\nLurie\u2019s Family Zoning Plan\nexpects to create 36,200 new homes by rezoning 92,000 parcels across the city. But in reality, the rezoning likely will generate between 8,500 and 14,650 new homes by 2045, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n, citing a report from the Controller\u2019s Office.\nThe gap between what the city hopes to accomplish in the next 20 years and what it can reasonably expect to build largely comes down to housing prices and how they trend over the coming decades.\nIf housing prices rise in line with the rest of the country, similar to before the pandemic, then it\u2019s predicted that just 10,098 homes would be built on the rezoned parcels.\nIf the city\u2019s housing prices\nrebound to pre-pandemic levels\nby 2030 and then grow faster than the nationwide market until 2045, then up to 17,845 new homes are predicted for the rezoned parcels.\nWithout rezoning, those same parcels likely would produce just 1,600 to 3,200 homes.\nThe city of San Francisco has been tasked with planning for 82,069 new homes as part of the\nstate-mandated housing production cycle\n. A city report this spring showed capacity for 58,100 new units between permitted projects and existing zoning.\nIt all comes down to whether developers and homebuilders can feasibly produce the number of housing units the city can make way for by rezoning.\n\u201cWe want it to be faster than what the numbers show, but that is not something we as a city can be in control of,\u201d\ncity planning director Sarah Dennis Phillips\ntold the outlet. \u201cWe understand that the more capacity we create, the more we\u2019re creating better conditions for the economy to work in.

        "content": "The late gallerist Barbara Gladstone was known to have an eye for talent, working with art world luminaries like Robert Rauschenberg and Keith Haring.\nShe also apparently had an eye for real estate. Her sprawling bayfront home in the Cutchogue hamlet sold for $11.2 million, setting a record on Long Island\u2019s North Fork for a single-family sale. The sale was executed by Gladstone\u2019s estate.\nThe home at 12120 New Suffolk Avenue hit the market shortly after Gladstone\u2019s death in June 2024, asking $12 million. After an initial contract signed in January 2025 fell through, Compass\u2019 Bridget Elkin and her husband Eric found another buyer in September who closed on the property today. Douglas Elliman\u2019s Kristy Naddell brought the buyer.\nThe area\u2019s previous top deal, a waterfront home in\nneighboring Mattituck that sold for $10 million\nlast year, served as a point of comparison for how to price the home, according to Elkin. She also sold an $8 million home in Cutchogue earlier this year, which set the town price record.\n\u201cThese landmark transactions sort of reflect the North Fork\u2019s evolution into a more mature coastal market, and are approaching really like mid-tier Hampton benchmarks,\u201d she said.\nThe deal is a high watermark for a stretch of land that has seen\nvalues skyrocket in the last few years\nas city dwellers moved out east, with many seeking the pastoral quietude of the North Fork in lieu of the bustling and scene-y South Fork.\n\u201cPeople see the value here\u2026it\u2019s somewhat of a saturated market on the South Fork,\u201d Elkin said. \u201cWe have a little bit more of a non-flashy appeal.\u201d\nGladstone purchased the home in 2012 for $5.5 million. She undertook a meticulous renovation with the help of local designer Hadley Wiggins that left intact the shingle-style home\u2019s summer cottage aesthetic.\nThe 7,500-square-foot home sits on a 1.2-acre plot with 140 feet of bayfront that gives direct access to a private beach. The first floor features a waterside living room and dining room with fireplace alcoves and a screen-in outdoor porch with an outdoor dining room and kitchen.\nThe second-floor primary suite has an ensuite bath, multiple walk-in closets, a dressing room and a sitting room with an oversized fireplace. The rest of the floor has five other bedrooms, a library, an office, multiple wet bars and five bathrooms.\nA gunite pool faces the water and bayfront lawn. A beach-side carriage house holds a great room, home theater, and gym.\nTraditionally known for its more humble home nestled between acres of farmland, the North Fork experienced a surge of activity in the wake of the pandemic that has continued unabated through this year.\nPrices have climbed sharply since 2020, culminating in the median sale price surpassing the million-dollar threshold earlier this year, according to\ndata from appraisal firm Miller Samuel\n.\nGladstone, who died last year at the age of 89, had another one of her properties set a sales record earlier this year, albeit a heavily-caveated one. Her\nAnnabelle Selldorf\n-renovated Chelsea townhouse sold for $13.1 million in August, coming out to $2,980 square feet per square feet, a record for a townhouse resale in the neighborhood.\n",

        "content": "NuRock Companies proposes a 130-unit affordable apartment project near Opa-locka, marking its second planned development in the area.\nAlpharetta, Georgia-based NuRock wants to develop the L-shaped building, called Heritage at Gratigny Park, on a nearly 1-acre vacant lot on the southwest corner of Northwest 120th Terrace and Northwest 27th Place in unincorporated Miami-Dade County, according to a company filing submitted to the county this month. The area is largely industrial.\nNuRock is asking Miami-Dade for a zoning verification, which is generally requested to determine specifics on development regulations governing a property and whether it has outstanding violations. The firm\u2019s application also shows that it plans to seek funding from the Florida Housing Finance Corporation, a quasi-governmental entity that disburses financing for affordable and workforce housing development, including low income housing tax credits. FHFC usually requires a zoning verification from the municipality or county where a project will be built.\nNearby, NuRock plans another 130-unit multifamily building under the\nLive Local Act\n, a state law that incentivizes the development of below-market rate apartments by awarding property tax breaks to developers and allowing them to build larger projects. The 11-story\nResidences at West View Landing\nis planned for the southeast corner of Northwest 27th Avenue and Northwest 123rd Street in an unincorporated area of the county. All units will be designated for households earning up to 80 percent of the area median income, which exceeds the Live Local Act requirement that 40 percent of units are for tenants earning up to 120 percent of AMI.\nNuRock paid $2.6 million for the 0.6-acre, two-lot Residences at West View Landing development site in May, according to records.\nThe Heritage at Gratigny Park development site is owned by an entity tied to Bay Harbor Islands-based real estate development and investment firm\nArt + Tec Development\n, led by Gabriel Boano and Paula Lowenstein Boano.\nIn 2021, Art + Tec proposed an eight-story, 168-unit apartment building on the property, according to media reports. Construction never started, records show.\nNuRock is a multifamily development and management firm primarily focusing on affordable housing. Robert Hoskins is managing principal.\nIn Pompano Beach, NuRock developed the 92-unit Crystal Lake complex at 350 Northeast 32nd Court, and the 116-unit Heritage at Pompano Station building at 400 North Flagler Avenue. Both apartment developments include affordable units.\nLast year, NuRock completed the 140-unit Residences at Naranja Lakes with a pair of five-story buildings at 27550 South Dixie Highway in south Miami-Dade\u2019s\nLeisure City\nneighborhood.\nIn Hollywood, NuRock plans a 134-unit apartment project for low-income families at 6015 Washington Street. Hollywood commissioners voted in 2022 to lend\n$640,000\nto NuRock in support of its application to FHFC.\nAffordable housing developers remain insulated from market downturns due to unceasing demand for below-market rate apartments, especially in Miami-Dade where many remain priced out of market-rate apartments. Developers also can use LIHTC, government subsidies and grants that could improve their financial returns.\n",

        "content": "One of downtown Houston\u2019s most recognizable office towers is getting a $50 million makeover designed to pull it out of the post-pandemic doldrums and reconnect it with the street.\nGlobal developer Hines is overseeing the renovation of 910 Louisiana Street \u2014 formerly One Shell Plaza \u2014 in a sweeping redesign that will replace the tower\u2019s closed-off ground level with glass walls, retail and green space, the Houston Chronicle\nreported\n.\nThe project, slated for completion in 2027, is part of a broader wave of downtown office reinventions as landlords grapple with record vacancies and tenants demand more light, amenities and street-level energy.\nHines built the brutalist,\n50-story skyscraper\nin 1971 as its first major office development, later selling the property but staying on as manager.\nPartners Real Estate leases the tower for owner Busycon Properties. Shell occupied most of the 1.6 million-square-foot building for decades before relocating west, leaving behind an 800,000-square-foot lease it subleased to firms like NRG Energy.\nBut with that lease set to expire in December \u2014 and\nNRG preparing to vacate\n\u2014 occupancy will plunge from 86 percent to roughly 35 percent early next year, Partners said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a conundrum that all landlords are dealing with,\u201d\nHines\nproperty management director Mark Janssen told the outlet. \u201cSince COVID and working from home, \u2018office\u2019 has almost become a dirty word among investors.\u201d\nBusycon is taking the long view, however, and Janssen said he is betting that Houston\u2019s core will rebound.\nAccording to early construction filings, the overhaul will cost $49.6 million. Designs call for replacing heavy stone facades with floor-to-ceiling glass, creating transparent edges for food and beverage tenants, and softening the stark plaza with landscaping, curved paths and shaded seating.\nA 5,000-square-foot terrace and tenant lounge will overlook Smith Street, alongside an upgraded fitness center and a new 9,000-square-foot conference facility.\n\u201cThe redevelopment is focusing on the street life experience in and around the building, which is what tenants are craving,\u201d said Partners\u2019 Chip Colvill, who\u2019s marketing the tower with Winfield Haggard Jr.\nBusycon joins a string of landlords \u2014 including owners of Allen Center, Houston Center and the JPMorgan Chase Tower \u2014 investing heavily to keep aging office assets relevant. While renovations don\u2019t always yield instant results, the 910 Louisiana project is a bet on\ndowntown Houston\nevolving with the times.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Bal Harbour will join a lawsuit challenging Senate Bill 180, a law that restricts local governments\u2019 control over planning and land use regulations. It marks the village\u2019s latest fight against state legislation restricting control, following its opposition to the Live Local Act.\nMore than two dozen cities are plaintiffs in the\nlawsuit\nagainst Florida, which was filed in Leon County in late September. The state law, titled \u201cEmergencies,\u201d was signed into law this summer. It bans local governments from passing \u201cmore restrictive or burdensome\u201d comprehensive plan amendments, land development regulations, or procedures concerning review, approval, or issuance of site plans, development permits, or development orders starting on Aug. 1, 2024 until Oct. 1, 2027.\nMunicipalities argue that the law infringes on \u201chome rule\u201d authority over land use and zoning regulations. The village council voted to join the lawsuit at its meeting on Tuesday, following a discussion about the litigation at a September meeting. Each city that is participating in the lawsuit is paying a $10,000 flat fee for trial proceedings.\nOther South Florida cities and counties fighting Senate Bill 180 include Fort Lauderdale, Homestead, Cutler Bay, Pinecrest, Palm Beach. Miami Shores, Weston, Pompano Beach and North Palm Beach.\n\u201cIn order to engage in meaningful, long range planning for the future and regulation of development, to deal with changing circumstances and needs in your community, to respond to the requirements of chapter 163 for planning and zoning, you\u2019re required, over time, to keep these things up to date, and these sections of the bill really stand in the way of being able to do that,\u201d said attorney Susan Trevarthen, of Weiss Serota Helfman Cole &amp; Bierman, at the September meeting. Trevarthen represents the village.\nThe bill was presented in the\nlegislative session\nas an emergency management bill. A section of the legislation would strip cities of their powers in one-year increments every time that the local county falls within a hurricane disaster declaration and is within 100 miles of that storm\u2019s track.\nBut SB 180 applies to all land use and planning amendments, regulations or procedures, even if they are not tied or related to hurricanes or other emergencies, according to one of the filings attached to the Bal harbour resolution.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to participate in this, because I can see that it\u2019s tangentially related to the other matter that we are\ndealing with Live Local\nand I don\u2019t think we can sit on the sidelines,\u201d said Bal Harbour Mayor Jeffrey P. Freimark at the Sept. 16 meeting.\nFreimark was referring to the Live Local Act, a state law that incentivizes developers of workforce housing with height, density, tax and parking bonuses. The village has been\ntied up\nin litigation with\nBal Harbour Shops owner\nWhitman Family Development over its planned redevelopment of a portion of the property into a Live Local project.\n",

        "content": "A home known as the\nMalibu Dream Resort\nis on the market and ready to dance the night away.\nThe 31-acre vacation home and event venue at 12680 Yellow Hill Road is asking $52 million, Mansion Global\nreported\n. The price amounts to $5,778 per square foot and nearly $1.7 million per acre. The owner wasn\u2019t identified.\nThe property, which includes 10 acres of flat land, is \u201cone of the largest pads in the Malibu\nzip code\n,\u201d Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California agent Tomer Fridman said.\nIt last sold in 2020 for $8 million. In recent years, it has served as a high-end vacation home managed by Living the Dream, a Los Angeles-based real estate company specializing in\nluxury rentals\n, as well as a wedding and event venue.\nThe listing is handled by Tomer Fridman and Lior Totaiv of\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\nand Rudy Malka and Shay Gozlan of Living the Dream.\nAsking rents have ranged from $85,000 to $320,000 per month. Short-term rentals are also available at $13,285 for two nights.\n\u201cThe Malibu rental market has actually never been stronger. In fact we\u2019ve seen consistent demand and breaking record rental rates, particularly for unique trophy estates like this one,\u201d said Rudy Malka of Living the Dream. \u201cThe decision to sell was driven more by timing, pride of ownership and the property\u2019s evolution than by any change in market conditions.\u201d\nThe more than 9,000-square-foot home was built in 1994 and has undergone several remodels and updates in recent years.\nIt has eight bedrooms, 10 bathrooms with double-height ceilings, large windows and hardwood floors. The manse\u2019s great room and primary bedroom open to the backyard. Other amenities include a commercial-grade kitchen with wine storage, a gym, a media room and an eight-car garage.\nAn observation tower offers views of the property. There\u2019s an infinity pool and spa, landscaped gardens and several terraces, plus a lighted tennis court, walking paths and a koi pond. A second pool and lounge area is in another yard.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Also over the summer, the company considered\nmoving away from two market-rate high-rises\nin downtown San Jose amid questions about investor interest.\nBesides multifamily, Urban Catalyst opened an eight-story, 176-room\nMarriott TownePlace Suites hotel\nat 495 West San Carlos Street in the spring.\nThe firm\u2019s latest move toward market-rate is out of financial necessity, Founder and Managing Partner Erik Hayden said.\n\u201cThe type of housing that is viable for getting financing is primarily market-rate multifamily apartments,\u201d Hayden said. \u201cIt would be better for the community and our investors to build something sooner rather than later.\u201d\nObtaining financing for senior housing, student housing and affordable housing is often more of a challenge.\nSome developers are wary of housing altogether in San Jose.\nArena Investors affiliate Arena Limited, for example,\nsubmitted a proposal\nto turn the 199 Bassett Street building in downtown San Jose into an\nartificial intelligence\n-focused tech complex.\nThat site was previously planned to host a co-living housing project that would have brought 803 affordable units to the area, but the development fell through when former owner and developer Starcity defaulted on a $14.7 million loan secured by the site in 2021.\nSan Jose\u2019s multifamily market is enjoying strong demand and price variability across asset types. Affordable\u2011housing complexes have sold recently for\n$300,000 to $400,000\n, while luxury assets command more like $700,000 per unit. City\nincentives\n, including tax waivers and fee reductions, are being deployed to spur construction and address the shortfall in market\u2011rate multifamily supply.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Two months after a gunman killed four people at Rudin Management\u2019s 345 Park Avenue, the City Council introduced a measure that would set minimum wages for security guards and increase training requirements.\nThe Aland Etienne Safety and Security Act, named for one of the security guards killed in the building\u2019s lobby, would set minimum hourly wages and benefits for non-government security guards. The wage floor would have to be at least as much as prevailing wages, which are union-level rates set annually. For unarmed guards in\n2026\n, that rate ranges from $18.02 per hour (plus benefits) to $21.20 (depending on time on the job), and for armed guards, $32.70.\nThe debate over this bill is a familiar one: Union leaders are pushing for a wage floor that building owners and nonunion contractors view as an unlawful market intervention. High wages and benefits means the cost of security would increase for building owners, if they are not already paying for union wages.\nSupporters of the bill, including the building service workers\u2019 union 32BJ SEIU, say the increase in wages and training would improve retention in the industry and therefore, lead to more experienced officers who are better prepared for emergencies. They also emphasize that wages should better reflect the risk of the job.\nOpponents, including the Real Estate Board of New York, counter that the measure undermines labor negotiations and is barred by state law.\nDuring a hearing on Thursday held by the City Council\u2019s Committee on Consumer and Worker Protection, security guards testified about the perils of their jobs. Raven Skinner, who works at 345 Park, recalled that she would often fill in for Etienne when he was on break. She worked an earlier shift the day of the shooting.\n\u201cI was there that day,\u201d she said. \u201cThat could have been me.\u201d\nRachel Paoli, Etienne\u2019s partner, tearfully urged the Council to pass the bill, saying that the measure was a fitting legacy for someone who \u201calways looked after others.\u201d\n\u201cIn his final moments, he tried to protect others by shutting down the elevator to save his coworkers,\u201d she said.\nCity officials\nindicated\nthat Etienne tried to push a panic button to shut down the building\u2019s elevator banks. The gunman, Shane Tamura, was trying to reach the NFL\u2019s headquarters when he mistakenly took the elevator to the 33rd floor, where Rudin has its offices. There, he shot and killed\nJulia Hyman\n, an associate at Rudin, before turning the gun on himself.\nPaoli also spoke about wanting more support for families of security guards, noting that her and Etienne\u2019s seven year-old-son is afraid every time she leaves the house, fearing that, like Etienne, she won\u2019t return safely.\nThrough a spokesperson, Rudin declined to comment on the legislation.\n32BJ President Manny Pastreich pointed to an August\nreport\nby the UC Berkeley Labor Center, which found that New York City\u2019s security services industry had a 77 percent turnover rate in 2024.\n\u201cThis constant churn saps workforce experience and risks undermining public safety in our city,\u201d he said.\nHe said the bill would also ensure an \u201ceven playing field for contractors,\u201d and help lift a predominantly Black and Latino workforce out of poverty. His union represents 20,000 security guards in the city.\nFor nonunion security contractors, that could mean losing the competitive edge they had by offering lower pricing.\nSteve Amitay, executive director of the National Association of Security Companies, which represents private security firms, said the wage requirements would lead to job loss as building owners opt for alternatives, such as security technology or shifting security responsibilities in-house. He noted that clients have limited security budgets.\nThe bill requires the city to approve security guard training schools, which would teach courses related to responding to violence, deescalating interactions with someone suffering from a mental health crisis, first aid and other topics. Amitay said some of the bill\u2019s training requirements duplicate state-mandated instruction and questioned whether they would help avoid incidents like the shooting at 345 Park.\n\u201cThat was a tragedy,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWhen somebody is intending to kill people, and they have an AR-15, and they have malice in their heart, no amount of training is going to be able to stop that.\u201d\nAmitay reiterated this point during Thursday\u2019s hearing, pointing out that Didarul Islam, an off-duty NYPD officer who was killed in the shooting, was highly trained.\nCouncil member Julie Menin, who chairs the Committee on Consumer and Worker Protection, called Amitay\u2019s testimony \u201cinsensitive\u201d and \u201ccallous.\u201d In a back and forth with the Council member, Amitay acknowledged that better pay and training would improve security.\n\u201cYou just contradicted yourself,\u201d Menin said.\nMenin also insisted that the City Council has the authority to set minimum wage standards for the industry.\nThat is another point of contention that could result in litigation if the bill passes.\nREBNY submitted testimony arguing that the city doesn\u2019t have the authority to set its own minimum wage rates. The group also said the measure disrupts negotiations between the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations, which represents building owners, and 32BJ. The parties establish prevailing wages through collective bargaining agreements.\n\u201cBy making the minimum wage for the entire industry equivalent to the collectively-bargained wage rate, the legislation fundamentally undermines the value of collective bargaining and impermissibly intrudes on the collective-bargaining process,\u201d the group stated in written testimony.\nIn the waning days of the Adams administration, the bill seems to have momentum. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, who is sponsoring the bill, said during a press conference on Wednesday that she expects the measure to pass.\n\u201cThe cost of living for folks who would literally die for you and me needs to be addressed,\u201d she said.\nMembers of the administration did not testify at the hearing. Menin highlighted their absence, which she called \u201cshocking and appalling.\u201d\nA City Hall spokesperson did not acknowledge Menin\u2019s comments, but said the administration \u201cdeeply appreciates the critical role that security guards play in maintaining public safety.\u201d The spokesperson also said the legislation \u201cwarrants further review to ensure we fully understand how it aligns with existing state requirements.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Hotel investor Brian Ehrlich and spec home developer Fred Karlton are now looking to add \u201cMiami Beach city commissioner\u201d to their resumes.\nEhrlich, co-founder of Miami Beach-based Paradigm Hotels, is vying against five other candidates for the open seat created by city commissioner Kristen Rosen Gonzalez\u2019s decision to run for\nMiami Beach mayor\n. Among the other contenders is Monique Pardo Pope, an attorney whose late father was a Nazi-sympathizing, serial killer executed in 2012 for murdering nine people.\nEhrlich\u2019s other opponents include historic preservation activist Daniel Ciraldo; realtor Ava Frankel who is using Tik Tok and Instagram to promote her political platform; former Miami Beach city commission aide Monica Matteo-Salinas; and\nLincoln Road\nrestaurant owner Omar Jimenez who has advocated for environmental sustainability in North Beach where he lives.\nPardo Pope, Ciraldo, Matteo-Salinas and Jimenez have each lent tens of thousands of dollars to their individual campaigns, while Ehrlich has raised nearly $165,000 via his individual campaign and Miami Beach in Focus, his political action committee (PAC). Ehrlich\u2019s committee has received more than half of its contributions from other PACs, making it harder to determine the true donors to Miami Beach in Focus, campaign finance reports show.\nIn the other city commission race,\nKarlton\n, who leads Miami Beach-based Karlton Companies, is looking to unseat incumbent city commissioner Laura Dominguez. The race has taken a nasty turn over accusations by Karlton and Miami Beach city commissioner David Suarez that Dominguez repeatedly voted for legislation that benefits developers who have financially supported her campaigns. Karlton is bankrolling his own campaign, while Dominguez is relying heavily on donors, including prominent individuals and companies in real estate and hospitality, according to their campaign financial filings.\nThe race to replace Rosen Gonzalez\nNone of the candidates running for Rosen Gonzalez\u2019s open seat have consolidated support from players in real estate and hospitality, with the exception of Ehrlich, campaign finance reports show. Ehrlich\u2019s individual campaign has received $1,000 each from Arnaud Karsenti, managing principal of Coconut Grove-based development firm\n13th Floor Investments\n, his wife Rebecca Karsenti, the Catalina Hotel at 1732 Collins Avenue, and two entities managed by Miami Beach-based real estate investor\nJimmy Resnick\n.\nEhrlich is the only candidate in both races who is raising money through a PAC in addition to an individual campaign account, documents filed with the city show. His Miami Beach in Focus has raised $109,400 through Oct. 17, according to city records. Nearly a quarter came from Shawn Vardi, who leads Miami Beach-based\nThink Hospitality\n, a firm that owns seven Art Deco Hotels in South Beach. Vardi donated $25,000 to Miami Beach In Focus.\nChristopher Cuomo, ex-COO of Miami Beach-based Groot Hospitality, also donated $5,000 to the committee, campaign finance records show. Groot, led by\nDavid Grutman\n, owns Papi Steak restaurant in the city\u2019s South of Fifth neighborhood, and co-owns Liv nightclub in the Fontainebleau Miami Beach resort. Yet, $67,800 raised by Miami Beach In Focus came from two separate PACs controlled by Christian Ulvert, a Miami-based political consultant who ran former Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber\u2019s campaigns.\nThe individuals donating to Ehrlich\u2019s campaign and PAC believe he has a \u201ccompelling message about revitalizing Miami Beach,\u201d Ehrlich told\nThe Real Deal\n. His ideas include investing public dollars to create more tree canopy and pedestrian friendly improvements to Lincoln Road, Washington Avenue and Collins Avenue, Ehrlich said. \u201cThat is why people are donating to my campaign,\u201d he said.\nAmong the other candidates Ehrlich is battling, only a couple have received campaign contributions from real estate and hospitality interests. Matteo-Salinas has raised $63,126, including $38,000 that she lent to her campaign, financial reports show. Individual donors who gave her the maximum contribution of $1,000 include longtime LGBTQ nightclub Twist and its owner Joel David Stedman. Ocean Drive bar Mango\u2019s Tropical Cafe contributed $500 to Matteo-Salinas.\nPardo Pope had a little better luck tapping real estate and hospitality donors. Her campaign received $1,000 each from\nAlex Kleyner\n, a real estate investor who lives in Miami Beach; Julie Grimes, managing partner of the Hilton Bentley Hotel South Beach; and\nChris Paciello\n, another Miami Beach real estate investor who owns the Anatomy fitness club chain. Four affiliates of New York-based\nInfinity Real Estate\n, which recently acquired an Alton Road assemblage from Michael Shvo, donated a combined $4,000 to Pardo Pope.\nLast month, Pardo Pope\u2019s campaign gained notoriety after Miami filmmaker and civic activist Billy Corben posted a short video on his Because Miami social media accounts about Pardo Pope\u2019s father. A former police officer, Manuel Pardo was convicted in the 1980s of murdering nine people. During his trial, prosecutors presented evidence that Pardo collected Nazi memorabilia, idolized Adolf Hitler and had a swastika-tattooed dog.\nHis final words before dying by lethal injection in 2012 were, \u201cAirborne forever. I love you, Michi baby,\u201d referring to his daughter, who was four years old when Pardo committed his crimes, published reports state.\nKarlton sets scope on Dominguez\nIn the race to keep her seat, Dominguez is taking fire from\nKarlton\nand city commissioner Suarez. Dominguez was elected three years ago in a special election to serve out the term of the late Mark Samuelian, her life partner who died on June 22, 2022 from an undisclosed illness. She was also Samuelian\u2019s campaign manager and treasurer.\nKarlton and Suarez have hammered Dominguez over her ties to real estate developers and investors who have come before the city commission for project approvals since she took office. At a candidates\u2019 forum this month, Dominguez was caught on video ripping away the microphone from Karlton when he was rattling off the names of real estate individuals and entities who donated to Coastal Communities Matter, a PAC that supported Dominguez in 2022.\nFor instance, Nomade Lido, the entity that owns the The Standard Spa, Miami Beach hotel, donated $10,000 to Coastal Communities on Sept. 20, 2022, campaign finance reports show. The hotel\u2019s investors include billionaire Barry Sternlicht, star architect Bjarke Ingels, and Nomade People CEO Miguel Isla. Dominguez recently sponsored legislation to rezone The Standard Spa, Miami Beach that would have paved the way for a major renovation of the hotel.\nLast month, Dominguez pulled the item indefinitely at Isla\u2019s request due to controversy over\nNomade Lido\nagreeing to pay $1.2 million to a nonprofit created by the Belle Isle Residents Association in exchange for the association\u2019s support. Dominguez lives in Belle Isle.\nCoastal Communities Matter also received $10,000 on Sept. 12, 2022 from two affiliates of Location Ventures, the defunct Coral Gables firm founded by disgraced developer Rishi Kapoor. A year later, Dominguez was among six city commission members, including then-Mayor Dan Gelber, who voted to approve an ordinance on first reading that would have allowed co-living units on Washington Avenue between 15th and 16th streets where\nLocation Ventures\nwas under contract to buy two commercial properties. Kapoor\u2019s firm lobbied for the change, city records show. The legislation died when Location Ventures shut down in 2024.\nKarlton, who also donated $2,500 to Coastal Communities in 2022, told\nTRD\nthat he is a former Dominguez supporter. \u201cShe turned out to be a special interest candidate,\u201d Karlton said. \u201cShe talked about quality of life when she was running, and then she started voting for every high-rise. She has not voted against any of the projects and has sponsored nine of them.\u201d\nKarlton\u2019s campaign finance reports show he has raised $150,000, all of which he donated himself. \u201cI don\u2019t take donations,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to owe anybody any favors.\u201d\nIn a recent newsletter to his constituents bearing the city of Miami Beach seal, commissioner Suarez stumped against Dominguez.\n\u201cLaura Dominguez has a long history of dirty politics,\u201d Suarez wrote. \u201cMost politicians tell voters what they want to hear, smile during campaign season, then work behind the scenes for special interests. And when confronted with the truth, they lash out and play the victim.\u201d\nFor this election, Coastal Communities has not raised any funds, campaign finance reports show. Its last reported contribution occurred in October of last year when Big Easy Casino, a parimutuel gambling site owned by billionaire developer\nJeffrey Soffer\n, gave $3,000. Soffer also owns the Fontainebleau Miami Beach resort.\nFor her individual campaign, Dominguez has raised $310,628, with many real estate and hospitality bigwigs donating the maximum $1,000 each, including developer Michael Shvo; Jose and Diego Ardid, developers who lead Miami-based Key International; New York-based LeFrak Organization\u2019s managing director James LeFrak and a LeFrak affiliate; and two executives with Vlad Doronin\u2019s\nOKO Group\n. Other $1,000 contributors are restaurants Big Pink, Prime 112 and Ocean\u2019s Ten.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to have the support of local residents and small business owners in our city who share my vision and commitment to a neighborhood and residents first agenda,\u201d Dominguez told\nTRD\nin a statement. \u201cThose are reflected in my report and reinforce why our community and residents believe in my campaign.\u201d\nShe also accused Suarez of feeding misinformation to Karlton and Miami Beach voters. \u201cI have been attacked by a sitting commissioner who is using the city seal to influence an election,\u201d Dominguez said. \u201cHe takes a kernel of truth and then lies about it. Everything he does is misleading to the public.\u201d\nIn a statement, Suarez doubled down on his criticisms, saying Dominguez has \u201cvoted for every major upzoning since taking office, sponsoring more than 80 percent of them, and taking campaign or PAC money from over half the developers involved.\u201d\n\u201cShe was even caught on tape coaching developers on how to sneak their 400-foot towers through during low-turnout elections,\u201d Suarez said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a \u2018kernel of truth\u2019 (as she says), it\u2019s the whole cornfield of corruption.\u201d",

        "content": "A New York investment firm is doubling down on suburban Chicago retail.\nKPR Centers\nacquired Pointe Plaza, a 195,000-square-foot shopping center in north suburban\nNiles\nat 5660 West Touhy Avenue, for $40 million, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nCBRE brokers Richard Frolik, George Good and Christian Williams represented the seller, San Francisco-based Stockbridge. The price amounts to $205 per square foot. The center was built in 1999.\nThe deal marks KPR\u2019s second Chicago-area retail acquisition, following its 2021 purchase of\nSchaumburg\nCorners, and adds to a national buying spree that\u2019s scooped up more than a dozen centers over the past 20 months.\nA thin development pipeline and surging tenant demand, combined with sustained consumer buying habits, has turned\nretail real estate\n, long out of favor with investors, into a darling asset class.\nStill, the sale price reflects the bite of higher interest rates: Stockbridge paid $50.3 million for Pointe Plaza in 2014, meaning KPR picked up the property at a roughly 20 percent discount.\nThe shopping center is 94 percent leased, according to KPR. Anchors include Fresh Farms, Ross Dress for Less, dd\u2019s Discounts and Daiso, alongside more than 20 other retailers and restaurants.\nKPR COO Andrew Frank said the firm plans to aggressively lease the center\u2019s two vacancies with tenants that would complement the roster.\nRetail fundamentals continue to perform. National shopping center vacancy is about 4 percent, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers, with leasing activity surpassing pre-pandemic levels and rents climbing amid constrained supply.\nKPR owns and manages more than 10 million square feet of retail space across 20 states. Pointe Plaza likely fits its strategy of targeting well-located suburban centers.\nElsewhere in Niles, the Sterling Organization has a $440 million redevelopment of the\nGolf Mill Shopping Center\nin the works, one of several suburban Chicago malls poised for dramatic and costly transformations.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The money has gone toward expanding patrols and bolstering quality-of-life programs.\nDowntown now has more than 120 police officers assigned to the district, up from 90 a year ago.\n\u201cWe have to be more present,\u201d Comeaux said, a New Orleans native who previously served with the Houston Police Department. \u201cWhen people see the police, they tend to do less.\u201d\nComeaux said traffic enforcement has also been a focus: within 30 days of ramping up the effort, officers issued 400 tickets, an illustration they said of how \u201cout of control\u201d things had become.\nWhether the public safety efforts sway some big employers to hang onto their downtown offices remains to be seen, or if other factors weigh heavier on their decision-making processes.\nAT&amp;T\nis searching for office space in the suburbs, despite spending $100 million to develop a four-block headquarters campus that included the AT&amp;T Discovery District seven years ago.\nAT&amp;T holds a 1.1 million-square-foot lease at the 37-story Whitacre Tower, at 208 South Akard Street in downtown\nDallas\n, through 2030.

The group reported that it rehoused more than 250 people who had been living in downtown encampments.\nComeaux said Dallas police are preparing to implement a drone-first response system to cut down on emergency response times and improve community trust. He also touted recruitment momentum, noting that DPD recently launched its second-largest police academy class with 77 cadets \u2014 a rare achievement compared to other parts of the country as departments nationwide struggle to fill ranks.\nWith\nDallas\ngearing up to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup and a $3 billion redo of the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center, Comeaux said the department\u2019s focus is maintaining public safety for major events and residents alike.\n\u201cThis year, we\u2019ve retained more officers than any year recently,\u201d Comeaux said. \u201cIt\u2019s coming from morale \u2014 and culture.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The city has tapped Douglaston Development and Kinwood Partners to build a 590-unit residential building at the\nGansevoort Meat Market\nsite.\nThe city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation issued a request for proposals for the site in January, seeking developers for a 10,000-square-foot lot at the corner of Little West 12th Street and 10th Avenue in the Meatpacking District.\nUp to 55 percent of the apartments will be set aside as affordable, though the income levels have not yet been finalized. The development team intends to apply for the property tax break 485x; as a result, at least 25 percent of those apartments will need to be affordable, on average, to those earning 60 percent of the area median income. The developers, however, will not seek other city subsidies.\nSteven Charno, president of Douglaston, said in an interview that the building\u2019s market-rate units will subsidize the affordable ones. The development team is also not paying for the land, instead taking over the site through a 99-year ground lease and paying a nominal fee.\nIn an interview, EDC President and CEO Andrew Kimball said the developers were selected in part for their \u201ctrack record for delivering high-quality developments.\u201d Douglaston, a seasoned affordable housing builder, brought on Kinwood as an emerging developer, Douglaston\u2019s Jed Resnick said. The city\u2019s RFP encouraged teams to include \u201cemerging developers,\u201d defined as firms that have developed less than $30 million worth of projects, built fewer than 150 residential units and taken on fewer than 10 projects in as many years.\nKinwood fits the bill, but its founder comes with industry experience. David Himmel, who was chief operating officer at Jamestown and hails from a well-established real estate family, recently launched Kinwood (in fact, state records show the firm was registered this month).\nKimball said the city received more than 10 applications for the project.\nThe Promote\nnewsletter was first to report that the city selected Douglaston.\nThe housing development is part of a broader redevelopment plan, dubbed Gansevoort Square, that includes expanding the Whitney Museum. EDC estimates that the plan will create 3,700 construction jobs, 160 permanent positions and have a $1.1 billion economic impact\nThe site of the residential portion of the project is home to a two-story building, the district\u2019s\nlast meatpacking\nplant. The Gansevoort Meat Market cut a\n$31 million\ndeal with the city last year to end its lease, set to expire at the end of 2032, to make way for the redevelopment.\nThe tower that will rise in the meatpacking plant\u2019s place has drawn criticism from local Council member Erik Bottcher, who\nexpressed\nconcerns about the proposed project\u2019s height. Previous reports pegged the tower at 600 feet, but the development team and EDC said such details will be finalized when the site, which needs to be rezoned for housing use, goes through the city\u2019s land use review process. The city expects to begin that the rezoning process in early 2027.\nThe local Council member\u2019s sway over what happens on the site will likely hinge on whether the\nhousing ballot measures\nare approved next week.\n",

Paramount Group\u2019s head of real estate Peter Brindley will receive $12.3 million, and Ermelinda Berberi, Paramount\u2019s CFO and treasurer, will receive $4.4 million.\nParamount reached a deal in September to sell the company to Rithm Capital for $1.6 billion, or $6.60 per share. The deal still needs shareholder approval to close.\nBehler has been the CEO of Paramount Group since 1991. He spearheaded Paramount through its $2.3 billion initial public offering in 2014, which at the time was the largest IPO for a U.S. REIT. Paramount controls 13 million square feet of office space in New York and San Francisco.\nBut in recent years, Paramount\u2019s stock has underperformed its peers. Behler also generated headlines for his lavish perks and bizarre decision-making.\nEarlier this year, Paramount revealed it made millions of dollars in payments to Behler\u2019s personal companies and interests. The previously undisclosed payments included $3 million to a private jet company, of which Behler had a 50 percent stake, and $900,000 for Behler\u2019s personal accounting services.\nIn July, Paramount reported that it was under an SEC investigation related to disclosures for related-party transactions, conflicts of interest and executive compensation.\nThe Real Deal\nalso discovered Behler\npushed\nfor a no-bid security contract for 60 Wall Street, a 1.6 million-square-foot vacant office building, to Guardian Services, according to sources and communications reviewed by\nTRD\n. Behler\u2019s ex-girlfriend worked at Guardian and the two maintained friendly relations since their relationship officially ended.\nAt least one text between Behler and the employee, reviewed by TRD, revealed plans to meet up at Eric Ripert\u2019s Michelin-starred restaurant, Le Bernardin.\nOn September 9, 2019, Behler texted the employee: \u201cHow are you? Hope all well. Talk tomorrow?\u201d\nHer: \u201cYes please \ud83d\ude42 call me anytime xoxo\u201d\nAB: \u201ctime for lunch?\u201d\nHer: \u201cThat will be so nice to see you.

        "content": "When a process doesn\u2019t work, people find a way around it \u2014 legal or not.\nHousing court is an example, but first, another one. Trigger warning: It\u2019s about immigration.\nFor some desperate people, the benefits of moving to the U.S. are great, but the chances of immigrating legally are small, and it takes years just to get an answer. So they sneak in, or overstay their visa.\nFor the same reason, some New York landlords change the locks rather than go to housing court to evict someone \u2014 especially someone who\u2019s not on the lease. Housing court could be a two-year slog, cost thousands of dollars in legal fees and result in the squatter being allowed to stay. A lock-out often prompts the occupants to disappear.\nThe rule of thumb is to secure the apartment. Make all the moral judgments you want, but the basic economics are undeniable: If a risk justifies the reward, some people will take it.\nGothamist just ran a piece about lockouts. It featured Joan Rodriguez, who in 2018 moved into an income-restricted two-bedroom apartment in the Hub, Steiner NYC\u2019s luxury building at\n333 Schermerhorn Street\nin Downtown Brooklyn, to take care of Tina Ann Williams, the disabled sister of her incarcerated then-fianc\u00e9.\nRodriguez had not won a housing lottery for the affordable unit \u2014 for which there\u2019s a long waiting list of families seeking two-bedrooms \u2014 and she was not on the lease.\nIn 2022, Williams died. The next day, the landlord changed the locks. Rodriguez somehow got keys and moved back in, but two weeks later she was locked out again. She was homeless for three years before an appeals court \u2014 reversing a judge\u2019s decision \u2014 ruled last summer that she had to be let back in until her right to occupancy is decided.\nThe landlord told Gothamist that Rodriguez will get a lease if the city approves her rental voucher.\nRodriguez\u2019s lawyer told the publication that judges have been ruling against locked-out occupants with uncertain rights to an apartment. That suggests that most lockouts are of people who don\u2019t have a right to be there.\nThe question is whether to change the locks or take your chances in housing court. Both choices carry risks. A functioning court system would surely help.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat New York firms will send\nletters of interest\nabout becoming master developer for the Trump administration\u2019s Penn Station overhaul? Amtrak said Thursday it has hired Hunton Andrews Kurth as the project\u2019s legal adviser, KPMG as financial adviser and AKRF as environmental consultant. The project is on schedule to break ground by the end of 2027, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said. Send predictions to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: One reason to return a security deposit is that your tenant might one day become an important government official. Micah Lasher had to sue his first landlord, the notorious Steve Croman, to get his deposit back. Lasher went on to become Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s policy director and is now an Assembly member. He\u2019s also the favorite to succeed Rep. Jerry Nadler.\nLasher\ntold the story\nat a press conference about\ntenant harassment legislation\n, according to\nTRD\nreporter Lilah Burke. Lasher and his roommates won a judgment in small claims court, but Croman still didn\u2019t pay. So they went to put a lien on Croman\u2019s bank accounts. Croman\u2019s people then agreed to pay if Lasher vacated the order so there would be no record of the decision.\nElsewhere\u2026\nWe don\u2019t normally report awards, but there\u2019s a side story to the mixed-use project at 37 Hillside Avenue in Inwood, which just won an\nAmerican Architecture Award\nin the social housing category.\nThe development team (RiseBoro Community Partnership, Coconut Properties, Architecture in Formation, SLCE Architects and others) planned to build a sister project next door at the same time, but the affordable Mitchell-Lama co-op never returned a signed contract after shareholders agreed to sell an empty lot for $7.3 million.\nThe co-op\u2019s reasons remain unknown, and the parcel remains empty. If you missed my story about that, it\u2019s\nhere\n.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$7.75 million\nfor a 3,600-square-foot two-family house at 14 Bank Street in the West Village. Matthew Pravda, Matthew Lipsky and Matthew Lesser with Leslie Garfield\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$173 million\nfor 757 Third Avenue, which was handed back from BGO to New York Life Real Estate Investors via a deed in lieu of foreclosure.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$12.6 million\nfor a 3,811-square-foot condominium unit at The Henry, 211 West 84th Street on the Upper West Side. Alexa Lambert with Compass has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 31,885-square-foot, 8-story mixed-use property at 394 New Lots Avenue in East New York. Jonathan Imani with IMC Architecture filed the permit on behalf of Moshe Nachum.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

The seller was\n109Co\n, led by\nBastien Broda\n.

The sellers were architect\nGene Kaufman\nand his wife, pianist\nTerry Eder Kaufman\n, who had owned the property since the early 2000s. The buyer was\n14 West Village LLC.\nThe townhouse has about 3,600 square feet of living space comprising two, two-bedroom triplexes and a rooftop terrace.

        "content": "Father-daughter-duo Frank and Bella Campise are bringing their apartment tour app to thousands of college apartments.\nBella Campise had the idea for the app, Aigentless, which allows prospective tenants to follow self -guided tours of apartments without an agent, while she was searching for an apartment as a student at Northwestern.\nThe app\u2019s reach is about to expand from its base of 30,000 units to more than 80,000 units after signing on student housing firm Cardinal Group as a client. The Denver-based developer, owner and operator of student housing holds a 53,000-unit portfolio with about 100,000 beds.\nWorking with student-housing providers was a natural step in the company\u2019s progression, Bella Campise said. It wasn\u2019t long after she pitched the concept to her father, managing principal of JAB Real Estate, that she dropped out of school to get the app up and running.\nA year later, the company has 20 employees and has raised $2 million in pre-seed funding.\n\u201cThe younger consumer is also more used to, not only using an app, but also AI-native interactions,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are seeing a lot of utilization of the AI chat function specifically within students, but the product works and converts across different asset classes and geographies.\u201d\nThe appeal comes from prospective tenants\u2019 ability to book a tour on their own schedule rather than coordinating with an agent and to take in information about the property without the pressure of a hard sell. They receive an access code to a lockbox and can tour the property on their own time, including after work hours, while following a tour on the app.\nThat still involves a human touch. Prospective tenants have the option to contact agents through the app and work with property managers to secure a lease if they\u2019re interested in moving in.\nFrom the property owner\u2019s perspective, Frank Campise said it allows him to lease up a building more quickly and collect feedback from prospective tenants who are more comfortable sharing unfiltered opinions.\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s just you and the app, you can be more transparent, and we\u2019re going to get more honest feedback,\u201d Frank Campise said. \u201cAnd that feedback is going to be empirical. It\u2019s not based on [the agent\u2019s] memory.\u201d\nFrank Campise\u2019s JAB Real Estate, which he runs with Jim Jann, has been a longstanding player in Chicago real estate.\nLast year, the company scored a deal in the buzzy West Loop and paid $34.5 million to Chicago-based Waterton for the 81-unit midrise at 20 North Aberdeen. The price was about $5 million less than the seller paid to purchase it in 2017, according to Cook County records\nAmid a tight debt market, JAB has remained a dealmaker in Chicago. In 2023, the company sold a 56-unit Lincoln Park apartment building at 656 West Wrightwood Avenue for $14 million to Bill Silverstein\u2019s firm Beal Properties. A year prior, JAB paid $23 million for a Lincoln Park apartment complex that Campise had his eye on purchasing for two decades.\nThat same building, the 159-unit Hamden Court Apartments, was one of the first properties the Campises used to test out Aigentless.\n\u201cThe Aigentless tours did 70 percent of the leasing, and our live agents only did the other 30 percent,\u201d Frank Campise said.\nThe partnership was a natural continuation of Bella Campise\u2019s interest in the family business, she said. Her first experience with the company was helping her father with a condo deconversion while she was a freshman in high school.\n\u201cFrank and I had been doing walks around to look at properties since I was really young,\u201d Bella Campise said. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re both real estate nerds.\u201d",

        "content": "Marc Calabria\u2019s big\nresidential ambitions\nfor the Loop include scooping up another downtown landmark out of distress.\nA venture led by Calabria paid $4.2 million this month for the eight-story historic building at 401 South State Street, according to Cook County property records first\nreported\nby Costar.\nThe price is a steep markdown from the $68.1 million the building fetched in 2016, meaning the 484,800 office tower went for about $140 per square foot nine years ago and $8.65 per square foot today.\nDesigned by architect William Le Baron Jenney \u2014 widely credited as the father of the skyscraper \u2014 the 1891 building was a Siegel, Cooper &amp; Co department store and later housed Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co for decades. It\u2019s been designated a national and Chicago landmark for nearly half a century, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield, which marketed the property via auction on behalf of special servicer CWCapital.\nRobert Morris University\nwas the last tenant, occupying the entire building until 2020, when it merged with Roosevelt University and exited the space. The property subsequently fell into default on $47.8 million in CMBS debt, and the lender took title more than two years before hiring brokers Kelsey Berry, Cody Hundertmark, Hunter Moss and Jeremiah Olsen to sell it.\nCalabria, who heads Bloomingdale-based IMC Accounting &amp; Tax, didn\u2019t respond to the outlet\u2019s request for comment, and his plans for the building are unclear. But his nearby project may offer a clue: He\u2019s partnering with Chicago\u2019s Primera Group to convert much of the 41-story\nClark Adams Building\nat 105 West Adams Street into roughly 400 apartments, a redevelopment backed by nearly $68 million in city financing.\nThat proposal is part of Chicago\u2019s initiative to bring more affordable housing and mixed uses to the Loop\u2019s office-heavy core, particularly along State Street. The\nClark Adams\nplan recently cleared a key step toward landmark designation despite ongoing legal disputes involving the property.\nAt 401 South State, Calabria inherits a full-block site at the southern edge of the Loop, between Van Buren Street and Ida B. Wells Drive. The sale also includes an adjacent mechanical structure. A 2023 study by the Urban Land Institute, the Chicago Loop Alliance and the city identified potential reuse options for the property, from apartments to an athletic complex.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The firm began talks with Fort Worth officials about a potential development agreement for Brown Ranch, a vast tract in the city\u2019s extraterritorial jurisdiction, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nHines declined to comment on specifics, but the proposal signals the firm\u2019s ambitions to extend Fort Worth\u2019s suburban frontier west of its fast-growing\nWalsh Ranch corridor\n.\nFort Worth is weighing an agreement that would allow Hines to create a\nmunicipal utility district\n, or MUD, to finance infrastructure for the project. MUDs \u2014 once used primarily in rural areas \u2014 have become a common tool for developers building large-scale suburban communities, helping cover the steep costs of roads, utilities and other essentials via property taxes and assessments paid in part by new residents on the debt service of the infrastructure.\nUnder the proposed terms, Hines would help fund connections to\nWalsh Ranch\nParkway and Old Weatherford Road, while giving the city the right and obligation to provide water and sewer services. The plan also calls for a mix of residential, commercial and open-space uses, aligning with Fort Worth\u2019s long-term annexation and land-use goals.\nCity Council recently approved a similar agreement with\nGreen Brick Partners\nfor the 858-acre Shelton Ranch project in north Fort Worth. The Hines pact hasn\u2019t yet been scheduled for a vote, but council member Michael Crain signaled support, saying the city should stay proactive in shaping its western expansion.\nHines manages $91.8 billion in assets and oversees 156 active developments worldwide. Brown Ranch would mark the firm\u2019s next big move in\nNorth Texas\n. Earlier this year, the firm sold seven DFW master-planned communities to Starwood Capital Group in an $800 million deal.\nThe proposed project joins a growing roster of mega-developments transforming Fort Worth\u2019s outskirts \u2014 including the $5.1 billion Carver Ranch and $5 billion\nCole Ranch\nin\nDenton County\n.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Apartment construction is booming in South Florida, even though the market is past its pandemic-era leasing and rent peak.\n\u201cDevelopers are still very bullish on the Miami story,\u201d said Juan Arias, a national director at CoStar Group. \u201cYou have a lot [to be completed] in 2027 and 2028.\u201d\nAfter Covid\u2019s onset, out-of-staters rushed to South Florida, driving unprecedented demand, rent growth and a building spree that created a\nsupply overhang\n. A record 18,600 units were completed last year, outpacing 15,000 net new leases, just as the influx of Northeasterners and West Coasters slowed and many who weathered the pandemic here moved\nback home\n. Median asking rents in the tri-county region decreased 3 percent last month, year-over-year, according to Realtor.com.\nYet, developers are continuing construction like it\u2019s 2021, casting doubt on future lease-ups and rent growth, and threatening to prolong the supply overhang, experts warn.\nThe pandemic-era strong fundamentals have slowed, according to Arias. \u201cThat presents a significant headwind for the amount of multifamily getting built,\u201d he said.\nIn the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30, construction started on 14,515 apartments in South Florida, according to data from CoStar. This outpaces the 13,338 starts in the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30 of last year, and also the 14,464 starts during the same period of 2021, the data shows. It\u2019s also not far behind the 14,980 starts in the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30 2023. Yet, it far lags the peak 22,296 starts in the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30 2022.\n\u201cThe assumption is net deliveries are going to continue to outpace demand through 2027 for luxury properties,\u201d Arias said, adding that this \u201cmay be a little bit optimistic.\u201d It \u201ccould get worse.\u201d\nDevelopers are unfazed. By the time they finish towers, they believe demand will return and leasing will be robust. They say they\u2019re picking submarkets that will have appeal and need housing, and are adding amenities to draw tenants.\nYet, it takes an average of a year and a half to two years to stabilize a new project, much longer than the six-month lease-ups during the market bonanza, experts say. This means buildings finished next year will compete with those finished this year, and towers finished in 2027 will compete with those completed next year.\n\u201cIt gets sandwiched, so you won\u2019t see these properties lease up in 16 months,\u201d said Andrew Rahman, of property manager Crown Residential. \u201cIt will take much longer than that, and they are not going to see the results they want.\u201d\nTop of the market\nMost construction is of four- and five-star apartments, mostly in prime submarkets, according to Arias of CoStar.\nOf the total 26,502 units under construction, nearly 60 percent are in coveted neighborhoods east of I-95, and nearly a quarter are in downtown Miami and Miami\u2019s Arts &amp; Entertainment District, Brickell and Edgewater, CoStar data shows.\nThey\u2019re asking top rents that target specific demographics: well-heeled Miamians, many of whom work for the new-to-market companies, and out-of-state transplants, who often retain higher paying jobs outside of Florida. (Miami-Dade County\u2019s median income is $87,200, less than New York\u2019s $103,000, Los Angeles\u2019 $106,600 and Cook County\u2019s $119,900, according to HUD.)\nAlready, these high-end apartments have a vacancy of 13.4 percent, more than South Florida\u2019s average vacancy of 10.2 percent, CoStar data shows.\n\u201cA lot of the out-of-staters who want to go to Miami \u2026 that has slowed down and the amount of construction occurring in those particular markets is something we want to stay away from,\u201d said developer Robert Suris. \u201cWe feel those markets have a lot of inventory delivering.\u201d\nFuture in-migration will be key.\nSteve Ross, who started West Palm Beach-based\nRelated Ross\n, and Ken Griffin, who moved his\nCitadel and Citadel Securities\nto Brickell are prompting smaller firms to move to South Florida and bring employees who will lease, optimists said.\n\u201cIt used to be in Miami, your largest tenants were law firms. Now we are seeing different tenants we haven\u2019t seen in the past,\u201d said developer Dan Kodsi.\nBut Trump\u2019s immigration policies threaten South Florida population growth, Arias said.\nIn the first three quarters of this year, 13,693 people from abroad moved to Miami-Dade County, marking a 66 percent decrease, year-over-year, according to the Miami Association of Realtors, which based its analysis on driver\u2019s license exchanges. It marked a 63 percent decrease from 2023, 49 percent decrease from 2022, 14.7 percent decrease from 2021 and 30 percent decrease from 2019.\nMore than 2,050 Colombians; 1,600 Cubans and 970 Venezuelans exchanged their licenses in the first three quarters of this year, a decline from each of the past four years, the data shows.\nIn Doral, home to a large Venezuelan community, some with varying legal statuses, including Temporary Protected Status, are\nmoving\nto Europe for fear of deportation, leaving some apartment buildings with vacancies of 10 percent or higher.\nA number of Ukrainians, who also are eligible for TPS, and Russians broke their leases early at some of Estate\u2019s buildings, Suris said.\n\u201cThere has been a flight of even wealthier [people] that don\u2019t have immigration status that were renters of higher-end multifamily,\u201d he said. \u201cImmigration policy has affected the market for sure.\u201d\nNew York City\u2019s mayoral election could counter this. If Zohran Mamdani, whose anti-Israel stance and calls for higher taxes have prompted\nanxiety\n, wins, more New Yorkers could head south.\n\u201cPeople are counting on a huge growth in population if Mamdani gets elected, exceeding what happened during the pandemic,\u201d said Tal Frydman, of Newmark.\nAt the same time, homeownership remains out of reach for many, despite a slight drop in prices and mortgage rates. That\u2019s a boon for apartment buildings.\n\u201cIt\u2019s moving people from choosing to buy to being forced to rent. A lot of those are renters by choice, especially in the four- and five-star buildings,\u201d said Eli Beracha, a Florida International University real estate professor. \u201cThey can afford to rent, but they don\u2019t have enough for a down payment.\u201d\nGen Zers are inclined to pay higher rents in exchange for top buildings, market optimists said, pointing to Edgewater\u2019s\nForma Miami\n. Completed last year, it\u2019s 97 percent leased, despite rents reaching $7.70 a square foot, higher than the $3.19 a square foot average for top Miami-Dade units.\nSimilarly, Coral Gables\u2019 multifamily market is roughly 95 percent leased, partly due to\nFIFA\nopening an office in the city. But some staff are hired temporarily for the 2026 World Cup.\n\u201cWhat happens when these [people] move out?\u201d said Rahman of Crown Residential, referring to well-heeled employees. \u201cYou are going to see a slight drop\u201d in occupancy, he said.\nHollywood is particularly strained with the supply overhang, he added. Concessions abound: Tenants could get two months rent free at the 362-unit Bread Building; three months rent free and a $1,500 gift card at the 180-unit Griffin 441; and two months rent free and a $2,000 gift card at the 324-unit Hollywood Heights, according to their websites. All were completed last year.\n\u201cNo market that\u2019s not a bloodbath is offering two-and-a-half months free and gift cards,\u201d Rahman said. \u201cAll are trying to fight for the same [prospective tenants]. Unless there\u2019s a huge spike in population, and we\u2019re talking a tremendous spike, this is going to spill into 2028.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not stopping Calta Group from planning to start construction early next year of a pair of apartment buildings with\n251 units\n, combined, near Hollywood\u2019s Young Circle. They are expected to be completed in mid-2027.\nWill demand rise?\n\u201cDemand will definitely pick up by then,\u201d said Calta\u2019s Gaetano Caltagirone, adding that impending openings of retail, dining and a Brightline stop will drive demand. \u201cMiami is becoming extremely expensive. It\u2019s important to have these alternatives of living 10-15 minutes away from downtown Miami.\u201d\nThe current multifamily slowdown started about 10 months ago and will turn around, said real estate attorney Dennis Eisinger. But when?\n\u201cThat could be another two or four or five years. \u2026 Have the developers overbuilt? Yes,\u201d said Eisinger, of Eisinger Law. \u201cDevelopers just by nature are, \u2018Hey I am a developer, I see the future, and I know I can start now because in two years when my building is ready, I\u2019lll be good.\u2019\u201d\nAs a whole, South Florida\u2019s multifamily market remains healthier, benefiting from its ever-present appealing climate, coastal access and lack of a state income tax, developers and analysts said.\n\u201cOurs is a little bit of a slowdown, a minor downturn. It might be going down more before it goes back up,\u201d Eisinger said. \u201cLet\u2019s hope developers don\u2019t kill the market by overbuilding.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Keystone Development + Investment scored a $62 million loan for its office-to-residential conversions at two buildings near Dadeland Mall, a rare retrofit in South Florida.\nOffice-to-residential conversions took hold in the Northeast, especially in New York, in recent years, marking new chapters for the towers struggling with higher vacancy due to the growth of hybrid work. The adaptation is less common in South Florida, where the office market boomed during a pandemic-era influx of companies.\nIn the only known South Florida project, Keystone plans to create\n212 apartments\n, combined, at the seven-story building at 9400 South Dadeland Boulevard and the eight-story building at 9500 South Dadeland Boulevard in unincorporated Miami-Dade County. The properties are in the Dadeland area of\nKendall\n.\nUniondale, New York-based Arbor Realty Trust, through an affiliate, provided the $62 million loan, records show. Keystone recorded a notice of construction commencement five days after the financing closed.\nThe 145,400-square-foot building at 9400 South Dadeland Boulevard will be converted into 121 apartments, and the 113,100-square-foot building at 9500 South Dadeland Boulevard into 91 apartments, according to Keystone\u2019s project filings to Miami-Dade and a company representative who spoke with\nThe Real Deal\nin May. They are expected to be completed next year.\nBoth buildings were built in the early 1980s, according to LoopNet.\nThe conversions are part of Keystone\u2019s larger\nHyve\nproject on its 8.3-acre site now home to an office complex with a pair of garages. After the conversions, the firm plans a 25-story, 219-unit apartment tower in place of one of the existing garages.\nDespite South Florida\u2019s office market fortunes, fueled by unprecedented leasing by new-to-market firms and record rents, some landlords have felt the sting from higher interest rates and hybrid work. Instead of retrofitting the buildings, they\u2019re\nbulldozing\nthem to make way for new projects.\nAfter logistics company Ryder System left its former headquarters campus at 11690 Northwest 105th Street in unincorporated Miami-Dade, Bridge Industrial bought the site and plans a 330,000-square-foot industrial redevelopment with\ntwo warehouses\n. Ryder moved its headquarters to a smaller space at 2333 Ponce de Leon Boulevard in Coral Gables, citing the hybrid work shift.\nIn Boca Raton, BH Group, Pebb Enterprises and the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related Group plan to replace an existing office building at the Office Depot headquarters campus with an eight-story,\n500-unit\napartment building. Two other office buildings at the campus at 6600 North Military Trail that are primarily leased to Office Depot will remain.",
