        "content": "A federal judge in New Jersey sentenced Moshe Silber to 30 months in prison for his involvement in a\nbroad mortgage fraud scandal\n.\nSilber\n, 35, had turned himself in three weeks ago for violating the terms of his bond. He faced up to five years after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mortgage fraud in 2024.\nThe U.S. district court judge, Robert Kirsch, repeatedly said that Silber had committed a \u201csignificant crime\u201d and a \u201csignificant sentence was necessary.\u201d Silber, a co-conspirator of Boruch Drillman, had teamed up to buy an Ohio apartment building, the Department of Justice said. The group picked up the building, called the Williamsburg of Cincinnati, for $70 million, using a stolen identity, then flipped it to Drillman for $96 million, receiving a $74 million loan based on the second, inflated price.\nKirsch noted he deemed the fraud significant because of the \u201clayers and labyrinth of chicanery.\u201d\nThe sentence is shorter than another one Kirsch handed out in the scandal:\u00a0 Aron Puretz, who pleaded guilty last year to one count of wire fraud, got\n60 months\n, though his son, Chaim \u201cEli\u201d Puretz, only\ngot 24.\n\nSilber showed up to the packed court handcuffed, wearing a green jumpsuit with a white undershirt. Dozens of members of\nhis community\nwere present. Women read prayer books and cried during the course of the two-hour hearing.\nIn a surprise twist,\nMark Nussbaum\n\u2014\u00a0a lawyer who\nshuttered his firm\nin January and is the subject of several civil lawsuits over missing escrow funds \u2014\u00a0showed up to court wearing gold-rim glasses, a modern blazer and tight black pants. He sat with Silber\u2019s family and friends.\nAs the judge was reading Silber\u2019s sentencing, Nussbaum\u2019s phone went off, and security asked him to leave. (He returned to the courtroom at the end of the hearing.)\nKirsch observed that Silber had\nlived the American dream\n, with cars and jewelry worth $2.2 million, but still decided to commit fraud. He also noted how Silber had an annual salary of over $3 million from his father and from someone named Mr. Hoffman, yet claimed to be \u201cin the red\u201d financially.\n",

The buyer\u2019s identity had been hidden behind an LLC, which was signed for by Zalman Gottlieb.\nGottlieb is the financial controller for B&amp;H. Representatives for B&amp;H and Brookfield did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe sale of the 287,000-square-foot office property works out to $523 per square foot.\nIt\u2019s not clear what the new owner has planned for the 287,000-square-foot building, which is located around the corner from B&amp;H\u2019s iconic store at 420 Ninth Avenue. The retailer was previously reported to have\nexecutive offices at 440 Ninth Avenue\n.\n\nThe tenants at 333 West 34th Street include the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Sam Ash Music and Godiva Chocolatier. The MTA leases at least 100,000 square feet on a lease that isn\u2019t set to expire until 2035, according to\nCompStak\n.\nB&amp;H originally opened in Tribeca in 1973 and moved into its current store in 1997. The property is owned by the Kibel Company, which purchased it in 1994, according to property records.\nKnown as the Smith Barney Building, 333 West 34th Street was developed in 1954. SL Green bought the property in 2007 for $184 million and reportedly invested about $26 million worth into it. SL Green sold it to Nicholas Schorsch\u2019s American Realty Capital New York Recovery REIT in 2013 for $220 million.\nThe owner changed its name to New York REIT and then eventually went into liquidation, selling the property to Brookfield.\nThe West Side of Manhattan on 34th Street saw a surge of investment as the Related Companies\u2019 Hudson Yards and Brookfield\u2019s Manhattan West started to rise.\n",

The sale marks 10 percent off the initial price Gregg and his wife, Lisa, sought when it listed in June.\nThe couple purchased the eighth-floor unit in 2005 for $2.4 million.\nThe buyers were Elliott Investment Management partner Jason Genrich and his wife Sara, an attorney.\nThe five-bedroom, five-and-a-half bathroom home on East 82nd Street in the Upper East Side features a living room with a decorative fireplace, a primary suite with two bathrooms and two dressing rooms and a kitchen with a china closet. Two storage units were also included in the deal.\nGregg and Lisa listed the property in June for $12 million, eager to sell the unit at the prewar property as they continue to wind through a divorce battle that started almost five years ago.\n\nA Sotheby\u2019s International Realty team including Juliette Janssens had the\nco-op listing\n.\nRechler Equity, run by Gregg and cousin Mitchell Rechler, went public in 1995 and emerged as one of the tri-state area\u2019s largest real estate investment trusts. Eight years later, the company spun off its Long Island properties into Rechler Equity, an entity with roughly 7 million square feet in the portfolio today.\nRechler Equity is\nshopping the Hampton Business District\nin Westhampton Beach, a five-building, 385,000-square-foot industrial park. Bidding for the campus is expected to top $200 million, which would easily shatter Long Island\u2019s industrial sale record.\nElsewhere on the Upper East Side this week, Allen Simon \u2014 the inventor of the Wee Wee Pad \u2014\nagreed to sell\na sixth-floor apartment at 838 Eighth Avenue, which was listed for slightly less than $25 million.

        "content": "The 1.8 million-square-foot office tower planned for 350 Park Avenue is a special case.\nDuring an earnings call last month, Vornado Realty Trust\u2019s Steve Roth said the project was\u00a0 \u201cisolated, different,\u201d than other ground-up office projects in part because billionaire Ken Griffin is involved. (Griffin\u2019s Citadel is anchoring the tenant and is a partner on the project.)\nAt the time, Roth said the environment for ground-up development is otherwise so inhospitable that he doesn\u2019t think any other project will get off the ground anytime soon. Of course, RXR, TF Cornerstone and BXP might have something to say about that, given that they plan to break ground on their own\ntrophy office towers\nthis year.\nBut on Monday the Park Avenue project became the first office tower to be presented to the City Planning Commission in recent years. The Department of City Planning certified the project on Monday, kickstarting the monthslong public review of the project.\nThe project is made possible, in part, by the\n2017 rezoning\nof Midtown East, which allowed air rights from landmarked properties to be transferred to non-adjacent sites throughout the district. The development team is buying more than 480,000 square feet of air rights from St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and St. Bartholomew\u2019s Church. As part of those deals, the developers are paying more than $30 million to a public Realm improvement fund created as part of the rezoning.\nThe developers are also seeking special permits to add space for a public concourse and to make other design adjustments, hence why the project has to go through the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure.\nCorrection:\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly described the period of time that City Planning has gone without reviewing applications for office buildings, based on information from the agency.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: What City Council races are you watching closely? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The Department of City Planning will begin public review of the Jamaica Neighborhood Plan, a rezoning that is expected to pave the way for the construction of more than 12,000 housing units in the Queens neighborhood over the next 15 years.\n\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer postponed several stops on his book tour this week, citing \u201csecurity reasons\u201d as he faces criticism for voting in favor of GOP-drafted stopgap spending bill,\nPolitico reports\n. Schumer was expected to make stops in Baltimore, Washington, New York City and Philadelphia this week to promote his new book, \u201cAntisemitism in America: A Warning.\u201d\n\u2014 A professor is accusing William Paterson University in New Jersey of losing his 380 million-year-old fossils,\nGothamist reports\n. Paleontologist Martin Baker is suing the school, alleging that it botched sending the fossils to a colleague in Florida, resulting in the collection being sent to a landfill in Tennessee.\n\u2014 The city plans to build a new NYPD training facility and indoor shooting range on City Island,\nthe City reports\n. Residents of City Island have complained over the years about the noise from the shooting range. NYPD representatives say the new facility will result in \u201calmost zero to no noise at all.\u201d\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Monday was\n$33.9 million\nfor a condo unit at 15 Central Park West. The Zeckendorf-developed unit\u2019s last on-market sale was $22.7 million in 2008, though the condo is selling less than its initial listing price of over $60 million.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$150 million\nfor 333 West 34th Street. Brookfield was the seller of the Garment District office property, which is 287,000 square feet. Brookfield faces a significant loss on the asset after paying $255 million for the property seven years ago,\nper reports\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $45 million at\n10 East 67th Street\n. The Lenox Hill townhouse is 13,100 square feet and is listed by Serhant.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 48,902-square-foot, six-story, mixed-use building at 10-39 49th Avenue in Queens. The plans also feature 35 class-A units. Anthony Ng of Angelo Ng &amp; Anthony Ng Architects was the applicant on the file.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

        "content": "The Wilf family thinks its revamped development can go event bigger in New Jersey as West Orange looks to contribute its fair share of affordable housing.\nGarden Homes, the development company led by Minnesota Vikings owner Zygi Wilf, proposed building an apartment community of nearly 500 units across four buildings in a forest on top of a mountain in West Orange, Gothamist\nreported\n. A previous 136-home plan for the same land was rejected by the town.\nThe development would include 100 apartments for low- and medium-income residents, which would help West Orange on the path to contributing its fair share of affordable housing, as required under state law.\nLocal opposition is hitched to environmental concerns and the possibility the retraction of the forestland would lead to worse flooding. Environmental experts fear developing the 120-acre land \u2014 the largest undeveloped tract in a densely populated part of the state \u2014\u00a0could also lead to dangers for residents living atop a mountain.\nWest Orange Township Council president Joe Krakoviak doesn\u2019t support the project, but voted in favor of including it in West Orange\u2019s affordable housing plan in 2020, fearing the possibility of a lawsuit and a loss of control over what is ultimately built on the site through builder\u2019s remedy, a court order that allows developers to bypass town control to build affordable housing.\n\nWhen the Wilfs first proposed an initial project in the early 2000s, it was rejected and public safety was the chief reason given. The deputy fire chief testified it would be dangerous and inefficient for both residents and emergency responders.\nAfterwards, local residents banded together to try and preserve the forest as protected open space, but couldn\u2019t come up with the necessary financing.\nWest Orange officials and the Fair Share Housing Center kicked off negotiations over utilizing the land in 2015 to work towards affordable housing goals. At the time, the land was analyzed and there was no objection in including it in the town\u2019s settlement agreement, according to a Fair Share director.\nThe West Orange planning board is set to hold a hearing regarding the project on Wednesday.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner",

The 18-acre island is the last piece of real estate held by the Zieglers in Darien, where they\u2019ve embarked on a long-winded selloff.\nThe listing was first reported by\nMansion Global\n. Cynthia and her husband, Renfrew Brighton, are planning to relocate to the south.\nThe island with views of the Long Island Sound is accessible by a gated causeway. Not simply a plot of land, the island also has an 8,700-square-foot colonial home with six bedrooms, seven bathrooms and six fireplaces, and a two-bedroom guest house constructed 15 years ago.\nThere\u2019s also an infinity-edge pool, a private dock and a spa. It takes only minutes to get to the heart of Darien, an affluent town on Connecticut\u2019s Gold Coast.\n\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Lesle McElwreath has the\nlisting\n. She\u2019s pitching the two-lot listing as a way for a buyer to mold a family compound, like the Zieglers did. They\u2019ve since moved \u201cfar and wide,\u201d according to McElwreath.\nIn May 2023, the town of Darien\npaid $85 million\nfor Great Island, a peninsula off of the Gold Coast. The Steinkraus family, descended from Ziegler\u2019s granddaughter, put the property up for sale in 2016 for $175 million. The town floated a museum, youth camps, pickleball and a community pool among options for the land, which it aimed to preserve from extensive development.\nIn late 2023, descendants of the industrialist\nsold Ziegler Farm\nto an anonymous buyer for $57.5 million, more than $1 million per acre. The largely undeveloped 51-acre parcel was listed for $85 million, meaning the sellers took a 32 percent discount from the original ask.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "An odd thing happened Sunday after I tweeted about Lee Zeldin\u2019s\nabout-face\non climate change: I was attacked on X by an owner of rent-stabilized housing.\nUsually, we are on the same side. But this landlord\u2019s message accused me of being a left-wing \u201cactivist.\u201d\nAgitated, I\nfired back\n:\n\u201cFind one reporter on the planet who has written more about the failure of rent control. Let me know when you do.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t the only social media commentator to accuse me of bias. X users on the left have accused me of being an enemy of working people and a mouthpiece for the real estate industry.\nWhy? Because I advocate for privately-developed multifamily projects and don\u2019t believe social housing can solve the affordability crisis. Moreover, these critics note that I am employed by a real estate publication.\nI can see why people are confused. They want to assign everyone a label \u2014 liberal, conservative, Democrat, Republican, progressive, socialist, even libertarian. This way, instead of considering the contents of what someone says, they can just dismiss it based on a presumed tribal affiliation or financial motive.\nLet me be clear: I don\u2019t take positions on issues for the sake of a political party, ideology, employer or bank account. (No one goes into journalism to make money.)\nCredibility comes from basing your positions on economics, science, data and facts \u2014 even if it upsets your audience.\n\nTrying to live up to a label only biases your thinking. You\u2019ll start at the end \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m progressive, so I support rent control\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m conservative, so I support free markets\u201d \u2014 and then work backward, crafting a rationale for a predetermined conclusion.\nBetter to judge things on a case-by-case basis, even if the results don\u2019t fit a neat pattern. In my case:\nI favor regulation in the form of\ncongestion pricing\nbut not the\nHousing Stability and Tenant Protection Act\n.\nI support affordable housing, but not in a way that\nconcentrates poverty\n.\nI support a minimum wage, but not one that limits apartment projects to 99 units,\nas 485x has\n.\nI cheer the fundamental\nwork standards\nwon by organized labor but not the hotel workers union\u2019s special permit requirement that\nstopped hotel development cold\n.\nSometimes, a policy that seems reasonable \u2014 such as giving poor people but not high earners a break on sales tax \u2014 is impractical, which is why clothing items priced under $110 in New York are\ntax-free\neven for billionaires.\nThen there\u2019s the\nscaffold law\n, which sounds unreasonable, but on further exploration, is \u2026\neven worse\n.\nThe landlord who questioned my motives was gracious enough to delete the tweet after another reader came to my defense. And the owner then complimented my column about the legislature\u2019s\nbaseless bills\nagainst investors\u2019 buying houses.\nFor the record, on housing issues, we generally agree.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll never have enough housing in NYC until it becomes profitable to build, own, operate it,\u201d he\nposted\nrecently. \u201cYou can\u2019t\nregulate\nyour way out of a supply problem.\u201d\n",

The total contract volume was $85.4 million, up from\n$80.8 million across 27 signed deals\nreported in the previous period.\nDuring the same week last year, there were 19 contracts signed in the Brooklyn luxury market for a total volume of $75.3 million.\nThe top contract went to 246 Clinton Street in Cobble Hill with an asking price of $8.5 million.\nThe home previously sold over a decade ago for $4.4 million.\nSpanning 5,400 square feet with four beds and four baths, the 25-foot-wide home was renovated by Aman Architecture to maintain original details and add modern enhancements geothermal heating and cooling, radiant heated floors, water purification, smart home technology and an irrigation system for the garden.\nThe parlor floor features a living room with 21-foot ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows, and the garden floor functions as a self-contained one-bedroom.\nThe InHouse Group\u2019s Robert Earl and Virginia Incalcaterra had the listing.\n\nThe second priciest contract belonged to another Cobble Hill townhouse.

        "content": "Watermark Capital Group secured financing for one of Brooklyn\u2019s notable office-to-residential conversions.\nWolfe Landau\u2019s firm scored $125 million in construction financing for the conversion of 175 Pearl Street in Dumbo, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. Bravo Property Trust \u2014 an affiliate of Bravo Capital \u2014 and Integritas Capital provided the debt, which closed a year after BridgeCity Capital originated a $50.6 million acquisition loan.\nWatermark\nacquired\nthe eight-story, 185,000-square-foot office property last summer from Cannon Hill Capital Partners for $66.5 million. Landau immediately embarked on plans to convert the 1918-built property into a 19-story complex.\nOriginally, the plans reportedly called for a 14-story, 230,000-square-foot building with 238 rental units. Those plans have since shifted, with Watermark eyeing multifamily units on the eight converted floors and an 11-story condo property atop the rentals.\nCritically, the rental portion of the building will qualify for the city\u2019s 467m program, giving Landau a tax abatement for 35 years in exchange for 25 percent of apartments being earmarked for affordable housing. The abatement provides a 65 percent exemption for the first 30 years before falling to 10 percent annually for the last five years of the abatement.\n\nOccupants at the building included Constangy, Brooks, Smith &amp; Prophete, Thelab and coworking company Spaces. But a BridgeCity analyst said at the time of acquisition that all tenants had either departed or were soon to do so.\nAmenities are expected to include tenant lounges and a fitness center. Watermark expects to complete the conversion in 2027.\nLast summer, Williamsburg-based Watermark\nsubmitted a proposal\nfor a residential project on the site of a shuttered church in Greenwood Heights. The 218-unit project requires a zoning change from the district\u2019s light manufacturing zoning status to residential.\nIn June, the firm paid $15 million for Brooklyn\u2019s Hanson Place Central United Methodist Church in Fort Greene, while in late 2023, Watermark paid $12.3 million for St. Lucy\u2019s-St. Patrick Roman Catholic Church in Bedford-Stuyvesant and demolished it to make room for housing.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

That\u2019s a significant retrenchment from the\n391-unit project proposed\ntwo years ago.\nMichael Dubb\u2019s firm capsized the unit count amid concerns from the community, which Dubb said was a voluntary decision. The $220 million project now comprises 53 single-family homes, 153 townhomes and 82 villas, 29 of which would be set aside for affordable housing.\nThe development is still set to unfold on a property at the corner of Old Northport and Lawrence roads, previously home to a concrete manufacturing and sand mining operation. It also complies with Smithtown\u2019s Comprehensive Plan.\nBut opposition remains. The president of the Kings Park Community Association says the group remains concerned the development is too large and that the reduction in size will simply open the door for other developers to increase the size of their own adjacent projects. He added the project \u201cprovides no discernible benefits to the community.\u201d Concerns also include the area\u2019s environment, drinking water, traffic and schools.\n\nBeechwood is building a wastewater sewage treatment plant in conjunction with the Country Pointe Estates. The development is still a long way off; Dubb is hoping to secure all approvals by 2027 and complete work on the development by 2030.\nKings Park is home to several sizable projects, creating concerns for some community members about overdevelopment. Smithtown is creating a comprehensive master plan for Kings Park\u2019s downtown development.\nDespite concerns about overdevelopment, there\u2019s also a need to update the housing stock in the hamlet; the Country Pointe Estates project could increase the number of units in the hamlet by 4.4 percent alone, according to project consultants.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The deal was signed at the start of the year and closed a week ago.\nThe buyer used a limited liability company of its own to obscure its identity, but the entity appears to share an address with another well-known landlord, Taconic Partners, which also owns the neighboring property to the west of the asset. A representative for Taconic, however, denied the firm\u2019s involvement to\nThe Real Deal\n.\nA representative for Brookfield also did not immediately respond to a request for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe sale of the 287,000-square-foot office property works out to $523 per square foot. That\u2019s a small gain on the price per buildable square foot Brookfield paid New York REIT for the property in 2018, but not on the price per built square foot: Brookfield sold the property for more than $100 million less than\nthe $255 million\nit paid for the property seven years ago.\nTenants at the 10-story building include the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Sam Ash Music and Godiva Chocolatier. The MTA leases at least 100,000 square feet, according to\nCompStak\n, and is on a lease that isn\u2019t set to expire until 2035.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who brokered the transaction for either side.\nThe Garment District has been trimming the spirits of office landlords lately. A couple of weeks ago, Bahrain-based Investcorp took a hit on a pair of buildings in the neighborhood, selling them to Josh Rahmani\u2019s Empire Capital Holdings\nfor at least 68 percent below\nwhat it paid for them less than a decade ago.\nBrookfield\u2019s office luck has been a mixed bag of late, landing big leases but also facing serious distress. This month, the investor positioned itself to\nbuy a $93 million delinquent loan\non a distressed office building in San Francisco, which would allow the firm to ultimately take control of Vanbarton Group\u2019s 22-story property.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The lease spans the entire corner site at East 60th Street.\nAt one time, a Citibank branch occupied a portion of the ground-floor corner space of the property, which is also home to the Parc Cinq luxury building. In 2023, the building\u2019s co-op board \u2014 which controls the retail space \u2014 retained Newmark to market the site on Fifth Avenue\u2019s famed retail corridor.\nThe asking rent for the two-floor space was $4.8 million per year. The duration of the lease was not disclosed.\nA Newmark team including Jeffrey Roseman, Caleb Petersen and Drew Weiss represented the co-op board. CBRE\u2019s Jonathan Schley and GoodSpace\u2019s Chris DeCrosta represented the tenant.\n\nThe retail space used to have narrow windows befitting a bank, which have since been expanded. The alterations needed to go through the Landmarks Preservation Commission because the property is in a historic district.\nThis will be the global watchmaker\u2019s third spot in Manhattan. The Swiss company also has a sales boutique at 66 East 57th Street and a service center at 52-58 Gansevoort Street.\nIt\u2019s upping the ante with space on Fifth Avenue, long considered international shopping destination. It\u2019s set to undergo a seismic change after the city reached a deal with the merchants to redesign the street, Gothamist\nreported\nin the fall, which will see more space opened for pedestrians by doubling the width of the sidewalks between Bryant Park and Central Park.\nCity officials have estimated the redesign would cost $350 million, excluding the price of relocating underground utilities and sewers.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance subsidiary Barings purchased the property at auction on Thursday for $161 million.\nAt least three prospective bidders appeared interested in the property prior to the auction, according to court records. Barings, however, was the only qualified bidder to actually attend the event last week.\nIn May, MassMutual\nfiled a complaint\nagainst Rechler\u2019s firm after it defaulted on a $315 million mortgage, which matured earlier in the year. A spokesperson for the company said at the time that the property was high quality, but had a \u201cbroken capital structure.\u201d RXR had identified the building as \u201cdigital\u201d as opposed to \u201cfilm,\u201d meaning it was part of the company\u2019s portfolio that was deemed worth keeping.\nA loan modification was still a possibility at the time. As of May, there were about 300,000 square feet available, representing 40 percent of the building\u2019s total rentable area.\n\nRXR in April leased about 7,000 square feet to investment firm Yaupon Capital Management and 5,500 to Northampton Capital Partners, an infrastructure and energy-transition investment firm led by a former Apollo Global Management executive. RXR also signed renewals with SRS Real Estate Partners and Edelman Financial Engines and new leases with investment firm Tide Rock and Boundary Creek Advisors.\nThe 22-story, 760,000-square-foot building has estimated asking rents between $68 and $83 per square foot, according to CoStar.\nAn RXR representative declined to comment to Crain\u2019s on the auction.\nIn better news for Rechler, RXR and SL Green\nworked out a deal\non the $940 million mortgage backed by Worldwide Plaza on Eighth Avenue. The borrowers, which also include a subsidiary of the liquidating company for New York REIT, will use loan reserves to fund operating expenses and debt service shortfalls, according to Morningstar; the loan is still set to come due in November 2027.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "After seven years of searching, a pet product investor finally found a buyer for his Upper East Side condo.\nThe sixth-floor apartment at 838 Fifth Avenue, asking just under $25 million, was the priciest home to snag a signed contract in Manhattan last week, according to Olshan Realty\u2019s weekly report.\nAllen Simon, the inventor of the Wee Wee Pad, and his wife, Cynthia Simon, bought the apartment from the sponsor for just under $11 million in 2000. The couple sought to offload the condo nearly 20 years later with a $42 million asking price.\nThe 5,400-square-foot pad drifted\non and off the market\nfor several years and cycled through three brokerages before landing an inked deal. The contract includes two storage bins and a studio apartment.\nThe unit, which is due for renovation, has three bedrooms, five bathrooms and three fireplaces. It also features views overlooking Central Park and a private elevator. Amenities in the building, one of few condos lining the east side of the park, include a doorman and gym.\nCompass\u2019 Kyle Blackmon, Samantha Shuman and Ethan Mahgerefteh had the listing.\n\nThe condo was one of 36 homes in Manhattan asking $4 million or more to find buyers between March 10 and March 16. The total \u2014 just one pending deal higher than the\nprevious period\n\u2014 included 11 contracts signed for homes asking $10 million or more, the largest number of contracts for trophy properties since December.\nThe second and third most expensive homes to enter contract were two condos at 111 West 57th Street, both asking roughly $21 million, down $10 million from their asking prices when the developers started marketing them from floorplans in 2016.\nUnits 69 and 70, which were sold to different buyers, each span 3,900 square feet and have three bedrooms and three bathrooms. They also feature 14-foot ceilings and views of Central Park.\nThe Nikki Field Team with Sotheby\u2019s International is heading sales at the Billionaires\u2019 Row building, developed by JDS Development, Property Markets Group and Apollo. Amenities include a fitness center, pool, terrace and private dining room.\nOf the 36 properties, 27 were condos, five were co-ops and four were townhouses.\nThe homes\u2019 combined asking price was $323 million, for an average price of $9 million and a median of $6.5 million. The typical home spent more than 1,000 days on the market and was discounted 14 percent from the original listing price.\n",

        "content": "As the many candidates for mayor call for huge numbers of new homes \u2014 from\n200,000\n(Zohran Mamdani) to\n500,000\n(Brad Lander) to\n700,000\n(Zellnor Myrie) \u2014 Kenny Burgos is calling them out.\nThe CEO of the New York Apartment Association claims that most candidates are not truly pushing \u201cabundance\u201d as a housing goal, because none has identified a target vacancy rate.\nAbundance in housing means having far more units than is needed \u2014 that is, high vacancy \u2014 so renters and buyers negotiate prices down instead of bidding them up.\n\u201cA 5 to 10 percent vacancy rate should be the goal for a healthy housing market,\u201d Burgos said on his\nlatest podcast\n, reflecting the consensus view of economists.\nBut few city politicians take that position, for one simple reason: A vacancy rate of 5 percent would legally end the city\u2019s \u201c\nhousing emergency\n\u201d and thus rent stabilization.\n\u201cOver the past 50 years, elected officials have attempted to keep the housing stock as close to a 4 percent vacancy rate as possible,\u201d Burgos said.\nIt\u2019s a classic case of the tail wagging the dog.\nBefore\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s publisher, Amir Korangy, chides me for using an esoteric expression that confuses readers, I will explain. \u201c\nThe tail wagging the dog\n\u201d means something important or powerful is being controlled by something that isn\u2019t.\n\nIn this case, housing policy should determine the vacancy rate, not the other way around. But that isn\u2019t what happens in New York.\nBeginning with the citywide rezoning of 1961, elected officials have limited development, which along with strong demand to live in the city has kept the vacancy rate below the all-important 5 percent mark. When the rate surged after Covid, politicians\ndelayed\nthe Housing and Vacancy Survey until it went back down.\nThen it kept falling, all the way to a 56-year low of\n1.4 percent\n. That was a\nturning point\nin New York City politics. It\u2019s the reason all the candidates are talking about\nadding supply\n.\nBut, as Burgos alluded to, they don\u2019t want to add enough to solve the problem, because rent-stabilization would disappear and about 2 million tenants would storm City Hall like the January 6 mob did on Capitol Hill.\nBurgos represents owners of rent-stabilized housing, who obviously would rejoice at being able to charge market-rate rent. That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s wrong about\nrent control\nbeing a\nfailed policy\n.\nOn his podcast, the lobby group CEO challenged reporters to demand mayoral candidates reveal their desired vacancy rate. Tempting as that might be for journalists, it would serve no purpose because no Democrat could advocate for ending rent stabilization and expect to win the primary.\nBetter to cheer the plans that have a chance to break the 5 percent threshold, such as\nMyrie\u2019s\nand\nLander\u2019s\n, even if the candidates will never admit that is possible.\n",

But an analysis of public records found unsold buildings in the area accounted for\nmore than 20 percent\nof Manhattan\u2019s unsold units. An ill-timed development influx has left overpriced units piling up in Lower Manhattan.\nOne unit\nthat was sold\nin Downtown Manhattan was a West Village condo owned by Harsh Padia, CEO of HAP Capital. The sale of the unit for $60 million in an off-market deal represented a record for the most expensive condo in the area.\nThe Real Deal\nexplored the story\nof the tiny townhouse at 19 West 46th Street, a Midtown Manhattan relic that may be the third-narrowest in the entire borough.

        "content": "The Agency\u2019s Mike Fabbri was almost across the finish line on a Downtown Manhattan co-op sale.\nHis buyer, a woman in her 30s, had already signed a contract for the apartment and agreed to pay in cash. All that was left was the board application, a historically arduous process, but he was confident she fit the bill.\nThen came deal-breaking news \u2014 his buyer was the proud owner of a cockatoo.\nFabbri scrambled to pull together documentation that might convince the board that a new winged resident wasn\u2019t such a bad idea. He collected letters of recommendation from his buyer\u2019s previous landlord and a friend who used to watch her bird on occasion. Her doctor wrote a note testifying to the bird\u2019s capabilities as an emotional support animal.\nThe co-op board rejected her bid. Boards don\u2019t typically give a reason for their refusal, but given her other qualifications, Fabbri suspects it was the cockatoo.\nIn my time as a reporter, brokers across the city have recounted similar tales, especially when selling Manhattan co-ops, where rules are stringent and even the slightest error on a board package \u2014 or a dog teetering on the edge of 50 pounds \u2014 can scrap a deal.\nAs prices for co-ops stagnated, and buyers turned increasingly to condos, agents say several boards have\nrelaxed many of their policies\n, allowing buyers to finance more of their purchase or renovate their apartments in months that aren\u2019t June, July or August.\nCould requirements for pets, which appraiser Jonathan Miller\nonce referred to\nas a \u201cdog weighing-in ceremony,\u201d be the next to ease? While most still have weight and breed restrictions, blanket bans on pets are likely near impossible, since the pandemic prompted many New Yorkers to adopt a furry family member.\n\u201cPeople are not giving up their dogs, even if they love the apartment,\u201d said Brown Harris Stevens\u2019 Lisa Simonsen. \u201cSome people would probably prefer to leave behind a teenager.\u201d\nEven with restrictions still in place, brokers have found ways to skirt around the rules \u2014 and it usually involves tacking on a few numbers to the purchase price.\nOne of Simonsen\u2019s buyers was approved to buy a Park Avenue co-op, despite her two 70- to 80-pound hunting dogs.\n\u201cWhen you get to the point that you\u2019re getting full ask or over ask, they don\u2019t say no so quickly.\u201d\nUnlike Fabbri, other brokers have gotten lucky with the paperwork. About eight years ago, Compass\u2019 Vickey Barron was representing a doctor in the purchase of a co-op on lower Fifth Avenue.\n\nDuring the board interview, a member asked him if anyone would be staying in his apartment, to which he replied, his girlfriend, and potentially her dog. His response sent Barron on a chase to assemble the dog\u2019s vaccination records, adoption papers and anything else she could think of to prove the dog wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\nThe board\u2019s final request was for her buyer to bring the dog in for an interview.\nThe pup must have passed the test because Barron\u2019s buyer got the apartment. But last she checked, he\u2019d lost the girlfriend. And her dog.\nNot so fast\u2026\nThe time for acquisitions is now \u2014 at least that\u2019s what Real Trends co-founder Steve Murray\nprophesied on a panel\nat the HousingWire conference almost a year ago. And the latest headlines are proving him right.\nRumors swirled on Thursday that Compass was closing in on a deal to buy Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices. The speculation was all but confirmed in the afternoon when the Wall Street Journal reported that the firms were in\n\u201cadvanced talks,\u201d\nthough the story lacked any specifics about the pending sale.\nHomeServices CEO Gino Blefari\nrefuted the reporting\nin an email sent around to franchisees, claiming \u201cno such sale is being contemplated.\u201d\nTales of the alleged acquisition came just months after Compass purchased @properties and Christie\u2019s International Real Estate,\na $444 million sale\nthat sent shockwaves across the industry. In New York City, Compass and the local BHHS affiliate were both among the\ntop brokerages\nby sales volume in 2023, with Compass holding the No.2 spot with $5 billion in sell-side deals and BHHS in 18th with just under $100 million.\nIn the first two weeks of March, other major national brokerages have announced deals of their own. Keller Williams Realty, the largest brokerage by agent count, sold\na significant stake\nto Stone Point Capital, the parent company of CoreLogic. Earlier this week, mortgage firm Rocket Companies\npaid $1.75 billion\nto acquire Redfin.\nWith two deals in the books before the end of the first quarter, signs are pointing toward more acquisitions in the year to come \u2014 even if Compass buying BHHS isn\u2019t one of them.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nActress Grace Hightower sold the Central Park West co-op she shared with her ex-husband, Robert De Niro, for\n$18 million\nin the priciest deal to close in the city this week. The couple bought the apartment at 88 Central Park West for $21 million almost two decades ago.\nThe home, which De Niro and Hightower renovated after a fire in 2012, has five bedrooms, views of Central Park and an eat-in kitchen.\n",

        "content": "Waiting for a new Penn Station is a little like waiting for a train at Penn Station.\nYou are standing in the NJ Transit train hall, neck craned back slightly to stare down a screen that promises your train is \u201con time.\u201d A small number will appear next to your train, telling you where to catapult your body to join a swarm of commuters competing to squeeze onto the tiny escalator that will deliver you to your train.\nBut the number never appears, despite an automated voice that tells you the train is pulling up to the station. You get an alert on your phone that says all trains are suspended in and out of Penn because someone sneezed near some Amtrak signal cables. Or NJ Transit needs to investigate the sneeze; it is unclear. You know that no trains are coming, but that automated, female voice keeps informing you, over and over, that phantom trains are pulling up to the station.\nThat disembodied voice is a little like the announcements that the state is kick-starting a plan to redevelop Penn Station. You hear it, you want to believe it and then you wait and nothing happens.\nI\u2019ve been covering this project for the past 10 years, and in that time, the state has reintroduced the project at least five times. Many visions, by both the state and outside groups, have been pitched during that time.\nThis week Grand Penn Alliance, a group backed by hedge fund manager and Republican donor Thomas Klingenstein,\naccording to Gothamist\n, reupped a proposal it introduced in 2023. The plan calls for moving Madison Square Garden to the former Hotel Penn site, and building a park on the former arena site. Renderings show a classical facade, new train hall and single-level concourse. Last week Assembly member Tony Simone\npitched\nrevising plans for a megadevelopment surrounding the station to include more housing and a park on the Hotel Penn site.\nWe\u2019re still waiting on the state to announce its next move on redesigning Penn Station and whether Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s meeting with President Donald Trump on Friday will help get things moving. We\u2019ve been on standby for decades, and this train will not pull into the station until funding is lined up for the project.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: What is going on with\nBerkshire Hathaway HomeServices and Compass\n? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Mets owner Steve Cohen\u2019s casino project, which his press people will no doubt remind us should be referred to as Metropolitan Park, this week\ngot the rezoning\nit needs from the City Council, Gothamist reports. That was not a surprise, because the local Council member, Francisco Moya, supports the plan.\nCohen\u2019s main obstacle is getting parkland alienation from the state legislature, because the local state senator, Sen. Jessica Ramos, doesn\u2019t want a casino in her district.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the legislature will alienate the parkland over her objections, but that is rare for Albany. If ever an exception would be made, it would be for something like this. The parkland is really just a parking lot. \u2014\nErik Engquist\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 President Donald Trump hinted Thursday that he may seek Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s approval of a controversial pipeline as part of discussions that include congestion pricing and the redevelopment of Penn Station,\nGothamist reports\n. The so-called Constitution Pipeline would stretch 124 miles through New York\u2019s Southern Tier and western Catskills.\n\u2014 City health officials say two pet cats died after being infected with bird flu,\nthe New York Times reports\n. The cause of the infections was not clear, though potential sources include unpasteurized milk, contact with infected birds and infected food.\n\u2014 Last month Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado announced that he will not seek re-election next year. Now, it seems he\u2019s preparing to run for something else.\nCity &amp; State reports\nthat Delgado spoke at New York Somos in Albany last weekend and delivered \u201cstump speech-sounding remarks.\u201d He did not attend Hochul\u2019s private reception at the Executive Mansion.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Friday was\n$15.6 million\nfor a condo unit at 535 West End Avenue. The Upper West Side condo is 6,600 square feet. The unit was last sold in 2013 for $16.3 million.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$161.3 million\nfor 334-342 Madison Avenue. The 22-story office building was sold at auction after RXR\u2019s Scott Rechler defaulted on a\n$315 million\nmortgage on the building.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $7.2 million for 160 Leroy Street. The West Village condo is 2,000 square feet.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s\nArlene Gutterson has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 66,886-square-foot, 12-story residential building at 10 Van Cortlandt Avenue East in the Bronx. The development site sold last year for nearly $5 million. Saky Yakas of SLCE Architects is the applicant of record.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

        "content": "For some New York City property owners, there\u2019s still not enough incentive to limit carbon emissions.\nDozens of landlords are planning to pay fines for failing to comply with Local Law 97, rather than retrofit their properties to reduce emissions, according to responses by more than two dozen building sector executives to the Center for an Urban Future\nreported\nby Crain\u2019s.\nSome owners think the bottom line looks better if they absorb the fines that will be levied against them for failing to meet decarbonization goals dictated by the law. Retrofitting properties\u2019 lighting, insulation and various systems can be a costly endeavor in itself.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough sell,\u201d Center for an Urban Future policy director Eli Dvorkin told Crain\u2019s. \u201cFor many building owners, it just comes down to pretty basic math, and right now the payback period for those investments is long and getting longer with higher interest rates and rising costs for borrowing.\u201d\nBuilding owners are set to pay $268 per ton of carbon dioxide emissions that exceeds a property\u2019s 2024 limit, varying by building. Owners are required to file reports with the city by Mary to demonstrate compliance; emission reduction targets are set to grow at the end of the decade.\nSo far, a vast majority of buildings required to meet emissions targets are in compliance with the law. The Department of Buildings claims fewer than 11 percent are out of compliance with 2024-26 emissions targets.\n\nTo ensure future compliance, however, Dvorkin suggested the city may need to\nimpose higher fees\nfor violating the decarbonization law, something the Real Estate Board of New York opposes.\nAnother possibility is for the city to increase incentives and financial assistance to help property owners comply with the law, such as providing additional funds and tax credits.\n\u201cThe green economy isn\u2019t just going to build itself,\u201d Dvorkin added.\nThe aim of Local Law 97 is for the city to cut emissions 40 percent by 2030 and 80 percent by 2050 from 2005 levels.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The deal, which appears to be all-cash, works out to about $3,000 per square foot.\nThe nearly-200-unit building, blocks away from Washington Square Park, is\nknown for housing celebrities\nlike the Rolling Stones\u2019 Keith Richards and filmmaker Tim Burton and his ex-wife, actress Helena Bonham Carter.\nAbrams\u2019 new apartment, Unit 18GK, spans roughly 2,000 square feet and has three bedrooms and three bathrooms. It also features three terraces and views of the park and downtown Manhattan.\nThe co-op last traded for $7 million in 2008.\n\nSotheby\u2019s International\u2019s Martine Capdevielle and Brigitte Goldenberg had the listing.\nCapdevielle said the apartment would likely need a renovation, but declined to comment on the details of the sale.\nAmenities at the Art Deco co-op include full-time doormen and building staff. The landmarked building was designed by architect Harvey Wiley Corbett and built in 1927. It served as a hotel for wealthy artists until it was converted to a co-op in 1976.\nAward-winning actress Jessica Lange bought a ninth-floor unit at the building for $3.4 million in 2005, and more than a decade later,\npurchased the apartment\ndirectly above hers for $3.3 million.\nKeith Richards and his wife, Patti Hensen, sold their duplex penthouse at the co-op in 2018 for $9 million \u2014 roughly\n$1 million less\nthan they paid for it four years earlier. The couple initially tried to offload their pad for more than $12 million.\n",

        "content": "Bill and Dana Lozito\u2019s Trinity Southern is taking over development of a long-planned luxury condo project in Miami Beach called 29 Indian Creek,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nDeveloper Jason Halpern\u2019s JMH Development will remain an investor-partner and adviser on the planned 22-unit development at\n2901 and 2911 Indian Creek Drive\n, near the Faena District, Bill Lozito said. It marks the first South Florida development for New York-based Trinity, an owner-builder that has been involved in the ownership, assemblage or construction of more than 1 million square feet in its history, according to a press release.\nJMH launched sales of an 11-unit building on the site about\ntwo years ago\n.\nTrinity bought into the project for an undisclosed amount in September, Lozito said, declining to disclose more details about the deal.\n\u201cWe took the hard work that JMH has done and put our own spin on it,\u201d he said.\nThe development, which will overlook the Indian Creek waterway, will now include a 20-unit condo building with one- and two-bedroom units, and two two-story townhouses, the release said. Prices will range from $1.4 million to just over $3 million, and the developers tapped Ryan Serhant\u2019s\neponymous firm\nto lead sales. Serhant\u2019s other South Florida projects include Mercedes-Benz Places and MG Developer\u2019s\nThe George\ntownhouse development in Coral Gables.\nThe 29 Indian Creek condos will range from 820 square feet to 1,750 square feet. The townhouses will include 500-square-foot terraces with summer kitchens and wet bars.\n\nThe project will have \u201cas many [amenities] as the big developments,\u201d including a rooftop pool, gym and fitness area,\u201d Lozito said. Urban Robot is designing the development.\nBuyers will also receive membership to the beach club at the nearby Miami Beach Edition, according to the release.\nThe team could begin demolition work in April and begin construction shortly after that. The project could be completed by the end of 2026. Trinity is bringing its team down and will supplement construction labor with local subcontractors.\nThe developers will self-fund construction at the start and later take out a construction loan, Lozito said. Trinity is looking to work on additional projects in South Florida, he added.\nThe 0.3-acre Indian Creek development site previously traded in 2017 for $7.8 million. Halpern\u2019s JMH was tied up in\nlitigation\nwith former partners who included investor Dhruv Piplani. In 2022, a judge in New York dismissed the lawsuit filed by Piplani\u2019s PSB Indian Creek and affiliated entities, allowing JMH to move forward with the project.\nIt\u2019s a few blocks away from Len Blavatnik\u2019s Faena District, a luxury complex that includes the Faena House condo building and Faena Hotel Miami Beach, both developed with Alan Faena.\nAman Residences\n, developed by Vlad Doronin and backed by Blavatnik, is under construction in the district.\n",

IMC Equity\u2019s purchase also included two retail outparcels spanning 8,076 square feet built in 2023.\nIMC Equity representatives did not respond to requests for comment.\u00a0\u201cShoma Group has sold tens of thousands of units since 1985 and has never kept any assets longer than two or three years,\u201d A Shoma spokespeson said in a statement. \u201cThis has always been our business model \u2014 develop a project and sell the assets. There has been no change in our strategy.\u201d\nRoughly three weeks ago, Shoma sold a 2.5-acre shuttered car dealership at 3650 Bird Road for\n$35 million\n, abandoning plans to redevelop the site into a two-tower mixed-use project with 748 apartments and 20,000 square feet of retail.\n\nShoma sold the property for $1 million above its\n$34 million\npurchase price in 2022. A joint venture between 13th Floor Investments and Related Group, two Coconut Grove-based firms, and New York-based LeFrak Organization bought the site.\nThe same day the deal closed, Shoma paid off a $38.8 million loan secured by the former dealership, records show.\nShoma and its top two executives have faced some turmoil in recent months. In December, a foreclosure complaint was filed against Masoud and Stephanie Shojaee and two trusts under his name for allegedly failing to repay a\n$10.5 million\nloan secured by the retail component of Shoma Village. The lender voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit two weeks after filing it.\nIn January,\nCity National Bank\nfiled a foreclosure lawsuit against Masoud Shojaee and a Shoma entity alleging default on loans totaling $14.1 million, including a mortgage on a Coral Gables condo where the Shojaees reside. The bank quickly dismissed the complaint and reinstated the loans after reaching a settlement.\nShoma is also facing a pending construction defects lawsuit by the condominium association for\nTen30\n, a boutique three-story condominium with 33 units in Miami Beach that Shoma built in 2022.",

        "content": "A year into Coral Gables\u2019 Columbus Center\u2019s debt woes, Tourmaline Capital Partners paid $76 million for the property facing foreclosure.\nBryn Mawr, Pennsylvania-based Tourmaline bought the office complex consisting of a 14-story building and an eight-story building on a 2.5-acre site at 1 Alhambra Plaza, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The buyer borrowed $71.6 million for the purchase from Banesco USA.\nThe 262,000-square-foot complex was sold by receiver Chris Neilson, who was appointed by the court to oversee Columbus Center and its financials in the foreclosure suit pending against its previous owner, San Antonio, Texas-based Affinius Capital.\nAffinius started facing issues with its Columbus Center debt in March of last year. At the time, Affinius\u2019 $71.6 million loan on the property\nentered special servicing\ndue to its failure to renew an interest rate cap for its floating-rate loan, according to Morningstar Credit. That constituted a default under the financing agreement between Affinius and lender V\u00e4rde Partners.\nAn interest rate cap is a hedge against rate increases.\nIn October, Minneapolis-based V\u00e4rde filed the foreclosure suit against Affinius, alleging it defaulted on a\n$68.9 million\nloan. The total amount owed was $77.4 million, including interest and late fees, according to the complaint.\n\nThe $76 million sale to Tourmaline doesn\u2019t satisfy the total debt owed, but \u201crepresents a reasonable and fair market value,\u201d according to a motion to approve the sale filed by the receiver and V\u00e4rde in January in the foreclosure case. Tourmaline bought the property free from liens or other financial obligations.\nAffinius\u2019 attorney in the foreclosure case, Jamie Zysk Isani, didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment.\nAffinius, led by Len O\u2019Donnell, paid $10.7 million for Columbus Center in 1989, financing the purchase with a $10.6 million loan, according to records. The loan was amended several times in the following decades and assigned to V\u00e4rde in 2020.\nTourmaline, led by\nBrandon Huffman\n, also has an ownership stake in the 34-story\nCitigroup Center\nat 201 South Biscayne Boulevard in downtown Miami. In 2023, Tourmaline and New York-based Monarch Alternative Capital paid\n$250 million\nfor the 28-story office tower at 801 Brickell Avenue in Miami\u2019s Brickell. It marked the\nbiggest\nSouth Florida office deal that year.\nSouth Florida\u2019s office landlords have felt the\nsting\nfrom higher interest rates, skyrocketing property insurance and skittish lenders. While the tri-county region became a magnet for out-of-state companies from late 2020 through 2022, demand slowed in recent years. In some cases, even well-leased buildings have struggled due to higher interest rates.\nIn downtown Fort Lauderdale, lender Trimont filed a foreclosure suit in August against Alliance HP for allegedly defaulting on a\n$59.2 million\nloan for the 28-story One Financial Plaza at 100 Southeast Third Avenue. The case is pending, with Neilson serving as the court-appointed receiver for that property as well.\n",

The developers lease the site from Broward College.\nSantander Bank is the lender for the construction financing. Houston-based Marble Capital made a preferred equity investment for an undisclosed amount.\nPeter Mekras led the Aztec Group team that represented the developers in the loan and equity investment.\nParks at Davie will consist of studios and one- to three-bedroom apartments, with units ranging from 568 square feet to 1,415 square feet. It will include 6,200 square feet of retail and co-working space.\nAbout 77 of the units will be at workforce rents, according to a 13th Floor spokesperson. The targeted area median income will be determined when the project is closer to completion.\nConstruction will start this month, and is expected to be completed in 2027, the release says.\n13th Floor\n, led by Arnaud Karsenti, has completed about 3,900 residential units since its founding in 2008 and has more than 4,800 units in the pipeline, according to the release.\n\nIn July, the firm completed the\n420-unit Savio\napartment complex at 1874 Heron Club Drive in Delray Beach. The Ardid family\u2019s Key International, Wexford Real Estate Investors and CDS International Holdings partnered with 13th Floor on Savio, which marked the first phase of their Parks at Delray development slated for a total of 693 apartments and 54 townhouses.\nIn Hallandale Beach, 13th Floor is developing the five-story, 398-unit\nParks at Hallandale\napartment complex at 2002 Pembroke Road.\nJSB, led by J. Jay Lobell, is a private equity and alternative investment firm that focuses on real estate, according to its website. It has ramped up its South Florida investment in recent years.\nIn December, JSB paid\n$69 million\nfor the 197-unit Stellar at Emerald Hills apartment complex at 5800-5840 Lakeshore Drive in Dania Beach. JSB also bought the Havn Residences &amp; Yacht Club condo complex with 36 units and 54 boat slips at 176 Lake Drive in Palm Beach Shores for\n$58.5 million\nin 2023.\nThe Parks at Davie construction loan comes as South Florida faces a multifamily supply overhang. Developers completed a record\n18,600 apartments last year\n, outpacing 15,000 new leases signed, according to CoStar Group data. That\u2019s led to slower lease-ups, an increase in concessions and a slight decrease in rents. South Florida\u2019s median rent dropped by nearly 2 percent in February, year-over-year, a\nRealtor.com report\nshows.\nDemand is expected to catch up to supply this year and next year due to a slowdown of construction starts.\nSouth Florida multifamily\nconstruction lending\ncontinues to flow. This month, TM Real Estate landed\n$53.5 million\nto build the 250-unit Shalimar at Boynton Beach complex at 3570 West Boynton Beach Boulevard in Boynton Beach. That came on the heels of Savanna scoring a\n$380 million\nconstruction loan for the two 26-story Olara project with 170 apartments and 287 condos at 1919 North Flagler Drive in West Palm Beach.\n",

        "content": "Adam Neumann\u2019s Flow nabbed a $51 million acquisition loan and is partnering with Canada Global for a planned mixed-use project on an El Portal development site.\nNew York-based Ladder Capital provided the mortgage to a Delaware entity with ties to Flow that paid\n$71.5 million\nfor a 16-acre former trailer park at 8500 Biscayne Boulevard, records show.\nCanada Global\n, an Israeli real estate firm led by Assaf Tuchmair and Barak Rosen, came on board as a majority partner shortly after Miami-based Flow won a January court auction for the vacant property, a source familiar with the joint venture told\nThe Real Deal\n. In November, the two firms also partnered to purchase an Aventura office complex for\n$116.2 million\n.\nOn the El Portal site, the joint venture is planning to build 2,380-plus apartments with commercial space and a school, the source said. Approved for a 3 million-square-foot mixed-use project with 150 units per acre, a developer can build up to roughly 2,400 apartments.\n\nThe site, previously known as the Little Farm trailer park, has sat empty since 2016 when 45 residents settled a lawsuit with the village of El Portal and the previous ownership entity, led by Fu Jing \u201cLeo\u201d Wu. The Village and Wu\u2019s entity agreed to pay the residents $8,000 each for relocation costs. Wu also managed an entity that owned a former federal immigration building at 7880 Biscayne Boulevard in Miami.\nThe trailer park site and the immigration building landed in court receivership as a result of a 2020 Miami-Dade civil lawsuit alleging Wu\u2019s entities misappropriated funds from\nEB-5 visa investors\n. The federal program grants permanent residency to foreign investors who finance business and real estate development projects in the U.S., as well as their immediate family members.\nIn 2023, receiver Michael Goldberg entered into a settlement agreement with Wu that allowed the sale of the properties to move forward without Wu\u2019s objections. Upon both deals closing, Wu will receive $5 million from the sale proceeds. In 2023, Miami-based B Group Capital Management bought the immigration building for\n$23 million\n, but abandoned plans to also buy Little Farm.\nIn October, Miami-based Melo Group submitted a\n$35 million\nstalking horse bid for the 16-acre trailer park. During the court auction two months ago, Melo lost a bidding war to Flow by $400,000.",

        "content": "A group of investors bought Airport Commerce Park near Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport for $18.3 million.\nThe deal comes amid a paradox for South Florida\u2019s office market. While aging suburban buildings have traded at discounts and\nforeclosures\nhave popped up, Broward County recently scored two office deals for over $200 million each.\nAn entity managed by Jorge Linkewer, principal at Aventura-based Triarch Capital Group, as well as Sarah and Sergio Selcer bought the complex at 4101 Ravenswood Road in Dania Beach from ACP Partners, according to records and real estate database Vizzda.\nSergio Selcer is associated with Step by Step Management in Coconut Creek. ACP is managed by Mario Henriquez and affiliated with Brickell-based JCT Management, according to Vizzda and state corporate records.\nThe buyers borrowed $10.3 million from Popular Bank.\nCompleted in 1987, Airport Commerce Park consists of four one-story buildings on a 6.6-acre site, property records show. ACP Partners paid $13.3 million for the property in 2007.\nTenants include computer repair service Rescuecom of Fort Lauderdale, Ocean Exotic Car Rental, Precision Air Conditioning, Digital Marketing Service Pro and the Consulate of Sweden.\n\nTriarch, founded in 1996 by Linkewer, Daniel Halberstein and Mario Grosfeld, has a portfolio of about 3.5 million square feet of commercial real estate, according to its website. Linkewer also is founder of brokerage Axiom Capital Advisors, which lists the same Aventura office as Triarch.\nTriarch is a frequent South Florida investor. In 2023, it bought the Shoppes at 41st Street plaza at 10355 and 10405 Northwest 41st Street in Doral for\n$18 million\n. That came on the heels of Triarch\u2019s\n$7.2 million\npurchase of an industrial outdoor storage site at 12601 West Okeechobee Road in Hialeah Gardens.\nIn 2020, the firm scored a\n$35 million\nrefinancing for the One Turnberry Place office building at 19495 Biscayne Boulevard in Aventura, which Triarch bought in 2011 for $53 million.\nIn the fourth quarter, South Florida\noffice\nvacancies and asking rents\nremained flat or slightly increased\n, year-over-year, according to an Avison Young report. Broward County\u2019s average asking rent hit $40.18 per square foot, up from $38.34 a square foot during the same period of 2023. The vacancy rate fell to 14.5 percent from 16.8 percent. But in all of last year,\nBroward\u2019s\ntotal leasing was 2.4 million square feet, a 27 percent decline from 2023, the Avison report shows.\nGenerally, real estate has felt the sting from higher interest rates, skyrocketing insurance and a slowdown of the influx of out-of-state companies, experts have said.\nSome properties have traded at a discount. In September, Galium Capital bought the Lake Shore Plaza II office building at 1300 Concord Terrace in Sunrise for\n$17 million\n, a nearly 47 percent discount from its price in 2013. In January, Accesso Partners bought the six-story Sawgrass Lake Center at 13450 West Sunrise Boulevard in Sunrise for\n$36.5 million\n, a 36.4 percent discount from its price in 2018.\nStill, downtown Fort Lauderdale scored two mammoth deals. Last month, DWS Group sold the\u00a0 Las Olas Centre I &amp; II at 350 and 450 East Las Olas Boulevard for\n$208 million\n, and the\u00a0 Bank of America Plaza at Las Olas City Centre at 401 East Las Olas Boulevard for\n$220 million\n.\n",

        "content": "A partially built luxury condo project in North Bay Village, the city\u2019s first in more than a decade, may be back on track.\nNever one to shy away from a challenge, Vivian Dimond\nstepped in\nto take over development and construction of what is now called Tula Residences, a 54-unit, 21-story (once it\u2019s finished) building on the waterfront.\nConstruction workers disappeared from the site in late 2023.\nDimond\u2019s Bayshore Grove Capital took over the LLC that owns the property last year. Malaysian developer Pacific &amp; Orient, led by CEO Thye Seng Chan, will remain a partner in the project.\nIn Miami, most condo developers use the following strategy: buy land, hire a public relations firm to tease a project launch, begin sales, open a sales center, publicize that opening \u2014 maybe with a splashy party \u2014 etc.\nChan didn\u2019t really follow that approach. His firm waited to launch sales of the project, didn\u2019t make much of a splash when he did, and self-funded construction. The unit layouts weren\u2019t ideal, brokers and developers told me.\nLiens began to pile up, including nearly $7 million sought by the former general contractor. One vendor sued. That\u2019s when everything went dark. Residents on the island were not happy.\nI don\u2019t know exactly when Dimond\u2019s Bayshore Grove finalized its deal, but it made sense when I learned that she would be reviving the project. She made changes to the layout and floor plans, moved the lobby from the sixth floor (unusual choice by the original developer) to the ground floor, and plans to install larger windows for better views.\nOnce the building is completed in 2026, it will mark eight years since Pacific &amp; Orient secured its approvals.\nDimond\u2019s sales team, led by Brown Harris Stevens\u2019 Ellis Bachman, is tasked with selling nearly all of the units. Pacific &amp; Orient only had two buyers with contracts at the North Bay Village project. One was refunded, and another is staying in the deal, Dimond told me.\nWhile many developers seemed to shy away from the project, she saw it as an opportunity to be the first one out of the gate.\nNorth Bay Village has attracted tens of millions of dollars of investment, if not more, in recent years. But no one has gotten this far. Even though others (Eichner, Shoma, Sunbeam, Riviera Horizons, etc.) have launched sales of their projects, garnering much more attention than what is now called Tula ever did, Dimond\u2019s project is the furthest along, construction-wise.\nWhile there are downsides to picking up a project midway through construction, the upsides may outweigh them.\n\nIt will become harder and more expensive to complete a building from scratch today, given the situation with tariffs, concerns over construction labor as a result of immigration policies, inflation and more.\nBuyers are also less enthusiastic about waiting four, five, six years for a project to be completed. This is at a time when dozens of new condo developments are in the pipeline. Despite developer and broker talk of strong presales, we\u2019re hearing that a small number of projects are stalled.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nSo many Live Local Act project applications have been filed in South Florida. Are these developments getting built? Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential:\nDeveloper James Curnin and his wife Jennifer sold their waterfront 9,640-square-foot home at 66 La Gorce Circle in Miami Beach\nfor $60 million\n. A land trust named after the address purchased the property.\nCommercial loan:\nPPG Development and BH3 Management secured a\n$225 million refinancing\nof the loan backing Slate Hallandale Beach, a 250-unit apartment tower next to the Shell Bay Club. J.P. Morgan and Monroe Capital provided the latest financing for the building, which was completed in 2022. The lenders have both worked closely with Witkoff, which is partnering with PPG on the adjacent Shell Bay project.\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nA new oceanfront estate in Palm Beach hit the market\nfor $45 million\n. The six-bedroom, seven-bathroom and one-half-bath mansion at 1742 South Ocean Boulevard was completed last year on a 0.6-acre lot. Christian Angle of Christian Angle Real Estate has the listing for the 8,170-square-foot house. Property records show a company managed by recycling mogul Anthony Lomangino paid $10 million for the lot in 2020 \u2014 a steal in Palm Beach.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\nThe Great Elephant Migration, an art installation of 100 life-size elephant sculptures, is actually\nstill in South Florida\n. You may remember it as one of the most photographed Art Basel exhibits last year. Three elephants are on display at Four Seasons Hotel and Residences Fort Lauderdale, available to the public, while another four are at Four Seasons Resort Palm Beach. They\u2019ll be there until Tuesday.\nElsewhere in Florida\nSwerdlow Group agreed to implement a voluntary heat safety program for construction workers at its $3 billion project in Little River and Little Haiti,\nPrism\nreports. The Miami-Dade Housing Committee recently reviewed the development agreement for the 63-acre mixed-use development. Swerdlow is the first to make such a voluntary move after state lawmakers passed House Bill 433, which bans local governments from mandating heat protections.\nDevelopers are increasingly building homes on former orange groves, marking another threat to Florida\u2019s orange industry, according to the\nAssociated Press\n. Consumers are also drinking less orange juice, and citrus greening disease has hit the industry hard in recent decades.\nRepublican and Democratic lawmakers grilled state insurance regulators about a report that showed insurers funneled billions of dollars to affiliates between 2017 and 2019 while they claimed to lose money. The regulators told lawmakers that the report was never given to the legislature because it was unfinished, the\nTampa Bay Times\nreports. Former Insurance Commissioner David Altmaier commissioned the report, but after he abruptly left his post to become a lobbyist, it was left in draft form.",

        "content": "Sam Nazarian, once known as the \u201cEmperor of Cool\u201d in the nightlife industry has turned over a new leaf.\nIn 2008, Bloomberg celebrated his kingdom of hotspots in Los Angeles, and if you\u2019ve ever eaten at Katsuya or stayed at an SLS hotel you can understand why. The founder of SBE knows how to make hotspots buzzy for a work-hard, play-hard crowd of A-listers.\nBy 2019, Nazarian had nine offices around the world and 11,000 employees. \u201cI was the majority owner of my company, and I was the most unhealthy I\u2019d ever been,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the same ambition and drive that I\u2019d had.\u201d\nThat year, he\nsold the hotel brands in a cash-and-asset swap to Accor\n.\n\u201cI was looking for a reset,\u201d he said. The deal included a three-year non-compete clause in the lifestyle sector, giving him time to contemplate his next \u201cdisruption.\u201d\nNazarian turned to friends who were feeling the same burn-out. They turned him on to health types like\nMark Hyman\nand \u201cbiohacker\u201d Gary Brecka. From there, his wellness journey took him to luxury longevity retreats like SHA and Lanserhof and Chenot.\nThen along came Tony Robbins.\nRobbins was early to some of wellness\u2019s more unconventional practices: \u201cTony was the first guy who was going in an ice bath, and everyone thought he was crazy,\u201d as Nazarian put it. Nazarian visited Robbins\u2019 Fountain Life longevity center in Orlando, Florida. There, a bevy of tests found a \u201cpretty aggressive\u201d aneurysm in his brain.\n\u201cOver the next 30 days, I saw four top neurosurgeons, got four opinions, did more testing and then had a seven hour brain surgery that removed the aneurysm,\u201d he told\nThe Real Deal.\nThe aneurysm is gone, but Nazarian\u2019s commitment to preventative health and his relationship with Robbins continue.\nNazarian and Robbins are working\ntogether on wellness-focused hotels\nand longevity centers with a new brand called the Estate. (They\u2019ve already\ninked a lease\nfor a center at the Reuben Brothers\u2019 Century Plaza, have a hotel under development in St. Kitts, and plan 25 locations by 2030.) Meanwhile, Nazarian and entertainer Marc Anthony, who\u2019s also a partner on the Estate, launched a new hotel brand. HQ, which is a partnership with Wyndham, will also have a wellness and longevity strategy.\nNazarian\u2019s next\nbusiness boom\nmay not have the same hard-partying style as the last one, and his weekends reflect that. With a wife, three kids and a home in Miami\u2019s Gables Estates neighborhood, weekends are more about kids\u2019 basketball games and family dinners than the nightlife scene or even business meetings.\nFriday\nEvening\nShabbat dinner with my wife and three kids. We do it every Friday night. We\u2019re not very religious, but my kids are eight, six and three so it\u2019s something we\u2019ve always had as part of our cultural component.\nMy mom flew in from L.A., so having her with us was a treat as well. I grew up in Los Angeles but we\u2019ve lived in Miami for five years now. This is our biggest market area, and we made a conscious effort in 2019 to raise our kids in Miami as well, so we got a place in Coral Gables, where the best schools are.\n\nWe also have access to more quality-of-life things here, like being out on the water. We have a place in the Bahamas as well. And obviously proximity to Europe, which is very important to us; my wife\u2019s European, so we have a home in Montenegro. It\u2019s just easier to get around the world from Miami.\nSaturday\nMorning\nI took my three-year-old son to soccer practice, then I took my daughters to tennis practice at Coral Oaks.\nAfternoon\nAt 12 p.m., I had lunch on my yacht with one of our bankers from CFG, Erik Howard. Actually, on the way there I went and saw a site, but we haven\u2019t announced that yet.\nThe rest of the day, we took the boat out to Fisher Island Bay as a family. In L.A., you\u2019re on the water, but you never go out in the water. Now we have a boat in the back of our house, a 48-foot bay boat, but we also ended up buying the yacht in 2021. That\u2019s a 42-meter Benetti. Nothing crazy, but big enough for us and a couple friends.\nUsually we keep it in the Caribbean, at our place in the Bahamas or we\u2019ll go to St. Barths or discover new islands. But it just so happened to be here, so we jumped on it. It\u2019s such a pleasure to have it and get to see the city from the water.\nSunday\nMorning\nI worked out in the morning. We have these oxygen and red light machines in our house, so I got in the hyperbaric chamber and red light in addition to the workout. Then I took the girls to Hebrew school.\nAfternoon\nI went to a meeting with our general contractor. We\u2019re actually building a permanent bio-hacking and longevity addition [on our house]. Our team from the Estates designed it. When you think about home gyms and spas, they\u2019ve been very traditional. We really believe that there are some key components \u2013 saunas, the red light and oxygen \u2014 that can pivotally change the different KPIs you\u2019re looking for, whether it\u2019s better sleep, deeper sleep \u2026 there are lots of benefits.\nRight now I have the machinery, and now we\u2019re integrating it into a new structure. Another part of it is a meditation room, kind of a quiet room. We have three young kids, they can\u2019t find you there.\nAfter that I took my son to the park before I coached my daughters\u2019 basketball game from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. Then I had meetings from 4 p.m to 7 p.m on Sunday, because we had a board meeting on Monday.\nWant to hear more about Sam Nazarian\u2019s next chapter? TRD subscribers can join him at the next Salon Series event on April 3 to learn more.\nRSVP today\n.",

The tower is fully leased.\nFaisal Ashraf of Lotus Capital Partners represented the owners in the refinancing.\nHallandale Beach-based PPG and Paramus, New Jersey-based Premium Capital Resources bought the development site in 2018 for\n$43.3 million\n. The property includes the adjacent 127-acre former Diplomat Golf &amp; Tennis Club, which the firms redeveloped into the luxury Shell Bay Club.\nAfter Ari Pearl\u2019s PPG and Michael Herman\u2019s Premium completed Slate in 2022, Fort Lauderdale-based BH3 bought a 50 percent stake in the tower, according to the release. Premium Capital still has a stake in the building, a PPG spokesperson said.\n\nBH3 is led by co-founders Gregory Freedman and Daniel Lebensohn, as well as executive chairman Eric Edidin.\nThe recent refinancing replaces a\n$150 million\nrefinancing PPG and Premium had scored for the tower in 2022, records show.\nDesigned by Kobi Karp, Slate consists of one- to four-bedroom apartments, ranging from 859 square feet to 3,230 square feet, according to the release.

        "content": "The First Amendment may not save O Cinema from getting evicted for screening an Oscar winning documentary about the Gaza War and events that led to it.\nOn Wednesday, the\nMiami Beach\nCity Commission will consider Mayor Steven Meiner\u2019s request to terminate O Cinema\u2019s lease for a movie theater space inside a city-owned historic building at 1130 Washington Avenue, as well as end roughly $40,000 in grants to the nonprofit arthouse.\nMeiner moved to kick out O Cinema after it went ahead with sold-out showings of \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a film about the ongoing conflict between Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank. Directed by Palestinian activist Basel Adra and Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham, \u201cNo Other Land\u201d won best documentary feature at this year\u2019s Academy Awards.\nIn a newsletter to his constituents, Meiner called the film \u201ca false one-sided propaganda attack on the Jewish people that is not consistent with the values of our City and residents.\u201d\nMeiner and city officials did not respond to requests for comment. O Cinema co-founder Kareem Tabsch told\nThe Real Deal\nthat the nonprofit art house is ready to pursue \u201call courses to allow us to continue operating in Miami Beach.\u201d\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t ruled out what those measures would be,\u201d Tabsch said. \u201cI think it is very clear that when we decided to continue showing this film, [Meiner] introduced a resolution to pull our funding and cancel the lease.\u201d\nO Cinema is getting legal counsel from the Florida chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and Community Justice Project, \u201c Tabsch added.\nWhile some civil libertarians believe Miami Beach officials would be violating O Cinema\u2019s right to free speech by evicting the theater, the lease terms favor the city, according to commercial real estate experts.\n\nA copy of the agreement obtained by\nThe Real Deal\nshows that the city can terminate the lease \u201cwithout cause and without liability to the landlord\u201d as long as O Cinema is given 180 days prior written notice. O Cinema\u2019s five-year lease expired last year, but in April the city commission approved the tenant\u2019s option to renew for another two years, city records show.\n\u201cTo the extent it can be shown that canceling the lease was based [on the content of \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d] there would be a First Amendment violation claim,\u201d said Miami-based attorney Mitchell Jagodinski. \u201cThe question for the court would be whether the operator of the theater waived this claim via the lease contract.\u201d\nJagodinski is representing the developers of\nMiami Wilds\n, a canceled mixed-use project in unincorporated southwest Miami-Dade County that planned to feature a water park, 200-room hotel and 20,000 square feet of restaurants. Last year, Miami-Dade sued Mami Wilds to terminate a 2022 lease agreement to build the project on 66 acres of county-owned land.\nMiami Wilds\ncountersued by alleging Miami-Dade Mayor Danielle Levine Cava violated the developers\u2019 rights by allegedly killing the deal to appease environmental groups and boost her reelection chances.\nO Cinema likely waived a First Amendment claim by agreeing to the city\u2019s \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d clause, Jagodinski said. \u201cIt essentially gives the city full control to just cancel [the lease] whenever they want for whatever reason,\u201d he explained. \u201c[O Cinema] agreed to this type of situation eventually happening.\u201d\nMiami Beach\nelected officials are definitely within their purview to end the business relationship with O Cinema, said Jose Smith, a former city attorney for Miami Beach and North Miami Beach who also served on the Miami Beach City Commission from 1997 to 2005.\n\u201cI have not seen the entire documentary or the city\u2019s lease with O Cinema,\u201d Smith said via text. \u201cHowever, the First Amendment does not require the city to permit its tenant, in a city owned venue, to espouse anti-Semitic, hateful, one-sided propaganda, or to be subsidized by the city for doing so.\u201d\nYet, Norman Powell, a North Bay Village-based real estate lawyer who is also the city attorney for\nMiramar\n, isn\u2019t convinced the city of Miami Beach\u2019s \u201ctermination for convenience\u201d clause would trump a potential First Amendment violation claim by O Cinema.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the mayor\u2019s primary reason for terminating the lease is because he doesn\u2019t like this documentary being played there,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThe basis for termination is really not for convenience. It\u2019s being terminated to stifle free speech.\u201d",

Halfen and Rosenblatt financed the purchase with a $13.5 million loan from Amerant Bank, according to property records.\nRosenblatt and Halfen are both spec developers. In August, Rosenblatt sold a waterfront spec mansion in Bay Harbor Islands for\na record $22 million\n. In 2023, Halfen, who heads Treo Construction, sold a waterfront spec house in Golden Beach for\n$15 million\n.\n\nKrelstein bought the 8,300-square-foot Bay Point mansion for $11.2 million in 2020, records show. It was built in 1963 on 0.8 acres and has 190 feet of waterfront, according to records and the listing. It was renovated in 2023 and has six bedrooms and six bathrooms, records show.\nKrelstein first listed the mansion for $35 million in 2022, before upping the asking price to $42 million later that year. The price was subsequently slashed three times before the home was delisted in June, Zillow shows.\nIt\u2019s been a record year for luxury deals in Miami\u2019s\nBay Point\nneighborhood. In January, Fatos Rosenberg sold a 1.7-acre waterfront estate for\n$85 million\n, making it the most expensive home ever sold in Bay Point.

        "content": "Affordable housing developer Lewis Swezy plans an 80-unit age-restricted apartment project near the Earlington Heights Metrorail stop in Miami-Dade County.\nSwezy, through his Miami Lakes-based Centennial Management, wants to develop the six-story building with 60 one-bedroom apartments and 20 two-bedroom apartments on a 0.7-acre site at 4052 Northwest 22nd Avenue in an unincorporated area of the county, according to an application submitted to Miami-Dade this week. It will include rooftop amenities, 800 square feet of commercial space and 42 parking spaces.\nThe project, called Earlington Court Affordable Housing, will be for tenants 55 and older who earn from 30 percent to 80 percent of the area median income, Swezy said. A majority of the apartments will be for those earning 60 percent of AMI.\nMiami-Dade\u2019s annual AMI is $79,400, the Florida Housing Finance Corporation shows. To qualify for a unit designated for tenants at the 60 percent AMI bracket, a one-person household can\u2019t earn more than $47,700, and a two-person household can\u2019t earn more than $54,480.\nCentennial paid $875,000 for the five-lot vacant development site in 2019, records show.\nThe firm is asking the county for an administrative site plan review. It originally filed a request for a pre-application meeting in December.\nSwezy focuses on affordable housing, mainly using the state tax credit program that awards developers tax credits that they sell to investors and use the proceeds to finance projects. Centennial\u2019s portfolio spans more than 3,500 affordable units.\n\nIn recent proposals, Swezy filed an application to Miami-Dade last summer for an\neight-story, 132-unit\nage-restricted building at 13841 Southwest 252nd Street in the Princeton neighborhood.\nTax credits and other state and municipal government financing mechanisms make\naffordable housing\nmore resilient to elevated interest rates. While higher rates and other economic headwinds have\npaused\nsome planned\nmultifamily\nprojects, affordable rental development has continued. Also, demand is nearly ensured as many South Floridians are priced out of market-rate apartments due to\nrecord rent\nhikes in 2021 and 2022.\nAffordable housing also has proved a boon for developers. Last month, Swezy paid\n$14.8 million\nfor a six-bedroom Fisher Island home at 6923 Valencia Drive. He bought it from the widow of the late Russian real estate tycoon Dmitry Zelenov.\nDeveloper Michael Swerdlow wants to redevelop five Miami-Dade public housing complexes with\n5,730\naffordable and workforce apartments. On Tuesday, a county committee approved the project that would replace existing public housing complexes Victory Homes at 520 Northwest 75th Street, Newberg at 7200 Northeast Miami Court, Gwen Cherry 22 at 7101 Northeast Miami Court, Gwen Cherry 06 at the intersection of Northwest 71st Street and Northwest First Court, and New Haven Gardens at 7200 Northeast Second Avenue in Miami.\nThe P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related Group plans an\neight-story, 98-unit\nbuilding at 5350 West Flagler Street in Miami\u2019s Flagami. All units will be for households earning up to 30 percent of AMI.\nAffordable housing developers also have seized on the Live Local Act, a state law that allows bigger projects than permitted by a site\u2019s zoning and also grants property tax breaks to developers.\nRussell Galbut\u2019s GFO Investments family office proposes a\n410-unit Live Local Act project\nwith a 19-story and a 16-story building at 7350 Coral Way in Miami-Dade\u2019s Corral Terrace neighborhood. Dr. Jorge Perez, who specializes in neonatology and neonatal medicine, is a partner on the development and will lease a seven-story medical office building part of the project.\n",

It will relocate from 7,800 square feet at 777 South Figueroa Street and 9,973 square feet at 1100 Glendon Avenue, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.\nThe length of the lease, a Savills spokesperson said, is \u201cmulti-year.\u201d\nAsking rent in the building ranges from $6.50 to $7.50, according to a spokesperson for the landlord.\nThe Century City building, a 28-story, 627,000-square-foot, Class-A high-rise office building, is undergoing a $100 million redevelopment together with 1800 Avenue of the Stars by owner\nCentury City-based\nAnderson.

The seller was locally based LHMLP.\nThe deal works out to nearly $140,500 per room. Brokers Oliver Shah and Justin Myers of Atlas Hospitality Group represented the buyers. It\u2019s not clear what LHMLP paid for the property, and when.\nThe 87,500-square-foot economy class hotel, built in 1968, is near Interstate 5 at El Toro Road. Its rooms were recently offered for discount rates for refugees of January\u2019s fires in Pacific Palisades and Altadena.\nHotel sales in central and south OC have cooled, according to CoStar. Sales between Newport Beach and Dana Point were $125 million during the last \u201cvolume year,\u201d compared to a three-year average of $340 million a year.\nThe market didn\u2019t prevent Haley from doing well in its sale late last year of a 120-room Travelodge by Wyndham Orange County Airport/ Costa Mesa at 1400 Bristol Street\nIn December, the county agreed to buy the Travelodge from Haley for conversion into homeless housing under the state\u2019s\nProject Homekey program\n. The hotel purchase and conversion into 78 supported apartments was to cost\n$45 million\n.\n\nThe $45 million redevelopment project, dubbed Homekey Bristol, included a $4 million contribution from Costa Mesa and $3 million from neighboring Newport Beach. Orange County kicked in $7 million and nearly 50 project-based vouchers. The grants totalled\n$14 million\n.\nThe bulk of the money came from a Project Homekey grant from the state Department of Housing and Community Development, which kicked in\n$29 million\nfor the project led by American Family Housing. The Midway City-based nonprofit developer was to revamp the motel and run it as supportive housing.\nSuch grants generally cover the purchase of the property. In the case of the Travelodge, that means Haley likely sold the 120-room hotel for $29 million, or $241,667 per room.\nHaley Hospitality bought the Travelodge, built in 1970, in 2021 for\n$14 million\n, or $116,667 per room, according to the Central OC Times. The purchase came at the height of the pandemic, when the\nhotel industry tanked\nwhile\ntens of thousands of rooms\nwent dark.\nThree years later, the county, via a grant from the state, bought the 54-year-old motor inn for a 107 percent markup for its last traded price. And Haley walked away with a windfall.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

This month, the Planning Commission approved the revised environmental impact report for the project known as New Beatrice West.\nPlans include 3,400 square feet of shops and restaurants. An existing office building, home to Gehry Partners, would be retained.\nThe U-shaped, 135-foot-tall project, designed by Gehry, will have upper level setbacks to create terrace decks.\nConstruction is expected to take 18 months. A project cost and when NSB is expected to break ground were not disclosed.\n\nKarney Management, a property owner nearby, had repeatedly appealed the office building to attempt to force the project to undergo further environmental review, without success.\nThe company led by Aliza Karney Guren\nsued the City of Los Angeles\nto block the project. In January 2020, a Los Angeles judge ruled that the mitigated negative declaration conducted for the project had not sufficiently considered impacts to aesthetics, noise and traffic congestion.\nAs a result, the Planning Department was forced to redo the environmental review process, although project entitlements were not overturned by the decision, according to Urbanize.\nNew Beatrice West is the second collaboration between Larry Field, founder of NSB Associates, and his longtime friend Frank Gehry. In 2023, NSB completed its two-building,\n80,000-square-foot offices\n, designed by Gehry,\nin El Segundo\n.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

One is, that can\u2019t happen. It has to go back to voters. And the other is that it might be able to happen with action from the council and the mayor\u2019s office.\n\u201cWe\u2019re having that investigated through our attorneys right now,\u201d Bass said.\nShe hasn\u2019t spoken further about the topic since.\nZach Seidl, the mayor\u2019s communications deputy, didn\u2019t answer specific questions from\nThe Real Deal\nabout Bass\u2019 plans, but said in a statement to\nThe Real Deal\nFriday, \u201cwe are going to look at every possible option to support fire survivors and accelerate recovery.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear how the mayor or City Council could defy the results of the local ballot measure, which went into effect in 2023 and imposes a 4 percent tax on property sales above $5 million and a 5.5 percent tax on sales over $10 million.\n\nThe\nCity Charter states\nthat ballot measures can be overturned by voters in a subsequent election or by amending the City Charter to supersede the ballot measure.\nA spokesperson for L.A. City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMeasure ULA aimed to raise up to $1.1 billion in tax revenue to fight homelessness and build affordable housing. It has so far fallen far short of that goal, raising\nabout $300 million in its first year on the books\n.\nFewer than 5 percent of deals meet the threshold to be subject to the tax, but historically they account for about 40 percent the city\u2019s total property tax revenue, according to an analysis by Mott Smith, a founding member of the Council of Infill Builders and adjunct professor at the USC Price School of Public Policy.\nDuring her 2022 campaign for mayor, Bass\nnever took a stance supporting\nthe ballot measure, but she\napplauded a court ruling\ndismissing a lawsuit against it the following year.\nAnd later that year the former deputy mayor for housing took some heat saying real estate investors were having \u201c\na bit of a temper tantrum\n\u201d about the transfer tax, as\nTRD\npreviously reported.\n",

The campus at 1716 East 7th Street includes 364,000 square feet of studio space, offices, production support facilities and parking.\nIf all goes as planned, the project will break ground in 2027 and be completed two years later.\nOnce done, it could help to create a critical mass of residential, office and retail uses at the intersection of Alameda and 7th streets. Prologis\u2019 project is less than a half-mile walk to the\nRow DTLA retail and office complex\nor the recently opened Ava Arts District apartments, both located on Alameda Street.\nPoll finds support for building restrictions in fire-torn areas\nResults from a poll conducted by the Berkley Institute of Governmental Studies, co-sponsored by the Los Angeles Times, showed L.A. County residents were open to\nrestricting home building in fire-prone areas\n\u2014 to the tune of 70 percent of the nearly 5,200 registered voters surveyed between Feb. 17 and Feb. 26.\nMeanwhile, those same poll participants were a little more than halfway split down the middle on building higher-density projects, with 55 percent in support of said developments in urban areas.\nThe poll results call into question whether other cities in the county would be open to offsetting any housing shortage created should there be restrictions on building in fire-ravaged areas. In such a case, more time would no doubt be tacked onto efforts to quickly rehouse those who wish to return to homes damaged or destroyed by the fires.\nBuilder\u2019s remedy claims another win, this time in foothills\nSticking with the subject of building, this week brought more news for housing proponents by way of builder\u2019s remedy.\nA legal battle between a proposed mixed-use development and the\ncity of La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge\nis over. City officials gave up fighting the project, which would have consisted of apartments, hotel rooms and over 7,300 square feet of office space at 600 Foothill Boulevard.\n\nDeveloper Cedar Street used the builder\u2019s remedy loophole in state housing law to bypass city zoning requirements in exchange for including low-income homes. The city pushed back. However, a judge\u2019s order to either pay a $14 million bond or back off resulted in the latter by the city.\nLa Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge is the latest example in a rising tension playing out publicly between state and local governments.\nResi\u2019s whopping land listing\nIntrigue abounds around who might buy a\n$175 million, multi-parcel land listing\n.\nThe 33 acres, spread across 15 parcels in Benedict Canyon comes with a controversial past. Developer Gary Safady once aimed to build on site a Bulgari-branded hotel with 59 rooms, plus eight single-family residences ranging in size from 12,000 to 48,000 square feet.\nThe proposed project was axed in 2023 after then-planning director Vincent Bertoni caved to pressure from project critics and wrote a letter to Safady that called out project impacts well beyond what the city originally expected.\nSafady pulled a $30 million loan on the property from Motcomb Estates, the real estate investment arm for the Reuben Brothers. Records show Safady defaulted on the loan in November with Motcomb alleging a nearly $50 million unpaid balance at the time, pushing the parcels to the sales block.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether another developer might have a go at the property and buy it for purposes of another project. Any proposal is likely to face much of the same scrutiny Safady had in moving the Bulgari Resort Los Angeles forward.\nKeeping up with the OC\nCompared to a $175 million listing, the $16.3 million trade of a Laguna Niguel mansion may seem small. However, the closing marked an all-time record for the city.\nThe sale of the Spanish-style mansion in the gated community of Bear Brand Ranch also set a price-per-square-foot record in Laguna Niguel. The home at\n7 Searidge\npenciled out to $1,993 per square foot. That\u2019s well beyond the $625-per-square-foot held by the city\u2019s former residential record: a two-lot deal that closed in 2014 for $15 million.\nAs Orange County sees more unique developments come online, such as Almquist\u2019s River Street Marketplace in San Juan Capistrano, it\u2019s helping lend an air of cool and renewed desirability in the residential communities south of Los Angeles County.\n",

        "content": "State Farm General got its wish to hike home insurance rates by an average of 22 percent.\nThe news comes weeks after being\nstraight-armed\nby California\u2019s chief insurance regulator for a request to increase rates because of the Los Angeles wildfires.\nCalifornia Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara \u201cprovisionally\u201d granted the unit of Illinois-based State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance the emergency rate increase requested after billions in wildfire claims,\nthe Los Angeles Times reported\n.\nBut the increase \u2014 which includes a 38 percent rate increase for rental buildings and 15 percent for renters and condo owners \u2014 won\u2019t take effect until a hearing slated for April 8.\nLara approved the increase on March 14 after\nturning down the request last month\n, saying the insurer had failed to prove it was warranted.\nHe\u2019d given the insurer an opportunity, however, to provide more evidence to justify the request.\nIn making his decision, Lara called on State Farm to halt any pending nonrenewals of customers statewide and for the insurer\u2019s parent company to provide its California insurer an infusion of $500 million to stabilize its capital position, according to the Times.\n\u201cThe role of insurance commissioner involves balancing a stable and sustainable insurance market that serves consumers with effective oversight,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cTo ensure long-term choices for Californians, I had to make an unprecedented decision in the short term.\u201d\n\u201cThe facts will be revealed in an open, transparent hearing,\u201d he added.\n\nState Farm has faced years of losses and huge damage claims after the\nJan. 7 fires\nthat raged Pacific Palisades to Altadena, and leveled more than 12,000 homes.\nAs of March 11, State Farm General and its parent have received more than 12,000 fire and auto claims related to the wildfires, and paid\nmore than $2.2 billion to customers\n.\nState Farm General has estimated it will pay out $7.9 billion in the wake of the Palisades, Eaton and other L.A. County fires.\nBut, its net losses from the fires will be closer to $600 million after reinsurance payments, which largely will come from its parent company. Reinsurance is bought by insurers from other insurers to protect themselves from catastrophic events.\nLast March, the company announced it would\nnot renew 72,000 home, apartment and other property policies\nin California, citing wildfire risks and other concerns.\nThat followed a\ndecision in May 2023\nto stop writing insurance for new businesses, homeowners, and other personal property and casualties in the state, with the exception of personal auto policies.\nIn June, State Farm\nrequested a 30 percent rate increase for its homeowners policies\n, as well as other rate hikes, which await a decision. The request took state officials by surprise, with Lara saying it raised \u201cserious questions about its financial condition.\u201d\nState Farm General last month said it\u2019s lost $2.8 billion over the last nine years, including gains from investment income. State Farm Group, led by State Farm General\u2019s parent company, was given a superior financial rating in December by a rating agency.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "Forever 21 is preparing to potentially close hundreds of stores, including more than a dozen in Southern California, as part of its ongoing bankruptcy.\nThe Los Angeles-based apparel firm, hurt by plunging sales and competition from overseas e-commerce merchants, will make cuts across Los Angeles and Orange counties,\nthe Orange County Register reported.\nThe pending closures come after the 41-year-old company l\nocked the doors of its Downtown L.A. headquarters\nlast month at the California Market Center at 110 East 9th Street, in the Fashion District.\nAfter decades of family ownership, the retail chain was sold in 2020 to investors who now seek a new owner.\nThe company is preparing to close down its remaining 350 stories as part of its bankruptcy filing,\naccording to Bloomberg\n, citing anonymous sources.\nEfforts to find a buyer for the fast-fashion retailer to avoid a liquidation have so far failed, they said. Talks with one potential bidder are ongoing\nForever 21 reported to the state it would be closing eight stores across Southern California \u2014 but the closures appear to be more widespread, with hundreds of employees to hit the bricks, according to the Register.\nThe official closures include stores at the The Outlets at Orange, Main Place Mall in Santa Ana, Galleria at Tyler Mall in Riverside, Ontario Mills in Ontario, Victoria Gardens in Rancho Cucamonga, Montclair Place in Montclair, Lakewood Center Mall and at Los Cerritos Mall\nThe company said the layoffs and store closures are permanent, beginning April 25 and continuing through May 9, letters submitted to California\u2019s Employment Development Department.\n\nReaders of the Register also reported stores at Westfield Fashion Square in Sherman Oaks, The Shops at Santa Anita in Arcadia, South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, Promenade Temecula and Inland Center in San Bernardino had closing signs on their storefront windows.\nThe company,\nwith 58 stores in California\n, announced in February that it would shutter at least 200 stores nationwide.\nThe retailer was founded in 1984 by husband and wife Do Won and Jin Sook Chang as Fashion 21, in Los Angeles, with its first store on Figueroa Street.\nRenamed Forever 21, the chain grew into a nationwide brand known for its trendy and cheap clothing for teens and 20-somethings. At its peak in 2015, the company reported $4.4 billion in sales and 1,300 stores worldwide.\nBut over the years, the company faced numerous controversies, including accusations of wage theft, the use of cadmium in its jewelry, controversial slogans on T-shirts and the cheap labor used abroad to sew its clothing.\nIn 2020, its assets were sold in bankruptcy for $81 million to a group of investors that included Authentic Brands Group, Simon Properties and Brookfield Properties. That group, known as SPARC, owned retail brands including Lucky, Eddie Bauer, Aeropostale, Brooks Brothers and Nautica.\nIn January, SPARC said\nit was merging with JCPenney\n, creating a new group called Catalyst Brands, which left off Forever 21 from its list of brands. Instead, the company said it was seeking a new operator for the retailer.\nToday, fast fashion in the U.S. has been overrun with competition from Chinese e-commerce companies such as Temu and Shein, which produce and sell items for pennies, according to the Register.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "The first to retreat was Beverly Hills, which laid down its arms in the battle against the state builder\u2019s remedy.\u00a0 And now La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, which threw in the towel after a two-year fight.\nThe La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge City Council voted to withdraw from its campaign to block a five-story apartment-hotel-office project proposed by Cedar Street Partners under the anti-NIMBY law at 600 Foothill Boulevard, the\nLos Angeles Daily News\nand\nBisnow\nreported.\nThe reason: the foothill city chose to quit an uphill legal battle after a Los Angeles judge ordered it pay a $14 million bond to appeal\na court decision to greenlight the project\n.\n\u201cContinuing the lawsuits is no longer in the best interest of the city,\u201d Mayor Mike Davitt said in a\nstatement\nsaying that the financial costs of its appeal outweighed its potential outcome.\nThe decision by La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge to back down may mark a Waterloo for opponents of the builder\u2019s remedy, a once-obscure provision in state housing law that has empowered developers while frustrating cities and counties across the state.\nThe builder\u2019s remedy allows housing developers to skirt local zoning\nin cities such as Beverly Hills\nthat failed to certify their state-mandated housing plans, provided their projects include 20 percent affordable housing.\nBeverly Hills, which had vigorously fought a slew of state-sanctioned builders remedy projects,\nbroached a compromise\nwith developers last month.\nNow La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge must come to terms with Cedar Street, led by Jonathan Curtis, a former city councilman and mayor who bought the property during his term in office.\nThe locally based developer had employed the 35-year-old legal loophole to allow the 80-unit complex with 16 hotel rooms and 7,300 square feet of offices, with 16 apartments set aside for low-income households.\n\nThe project, designed by Mid-City-based Riley Projects, would replace a former First Church of Christ Scientist, blocks from a large commercial district.\nCedar Street Partners had filed a\nlawsuit in July 2023\n, after a yearlong back-and-forth with the city and repeated denials. Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta\nasked a court\nto support the project, as well as the state builder\u2019s remedy provision.\nThe decision by the city to back down sends a disquieting message to cities trying to push back against housing laws, Ryan Leaderman, a partner at Holland &amp; Knight, who previously represented the 600 Foothill project, told Bisnow.\n\u201cThe message is: stop playing games with housing,\u201d Leaderman said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a price to pay when a city unlawfully denies a project.\u201d\nDespite the city\u2019s decision to abandon its appeal, the Foothill Boulevard project must still clear several hurdles before winning local approval. While the builder\u2019s remedy waives zoning rules, such projects still must comply with environmental, infrastructure and health and safety standards, according to the Daily News.\n\u201cThe City and community will need to chart a pathway forward that integrates the 600 Foothill project as reasonably as possible, and we hope going forward the developer will work with us to minimize any detrimental impacts on the City,\u201d Mayor Davitt said in his statement.\n\u201cThe ball\u2019s in their court,\u201d Cedar Street partner Jonathan Curtis told Bisnow.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

County. The survey\u2019s estimated margin of error is 2 percentage points, and larger for demographic subgroups.\nA 2019 Berkeley IGS poll\nsaw support from three-quarters of California voters\n, including 79 percent in L.A.

        "content": "Office properties hit hard by the pandemic often end up in the hands of their lenders or bargain-hunting buyers before they get a chance at a revival.\nYet for a West Loop office portfolio that plunged from 90 to 50 percent occupied, co-owner R2 has managed to remain in the drivers\u2019 seat and go debt-free through a new partnership. Public records show its joint venture with Beltway Capital Management \u2014 finalized last month with a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure that took its former co-owner Heitman out of the picture \u2014 also adds a fifth building to the 350,000-square-foot portfolio.\nR2 bought six West Loop loft office buildings in 2016 for $86 million in a joint venture with Chicago-based Walton Street Capital. R2 later recapitalized a four-building portion of the portfolio in a joint venture with Chicago-based Heitman in 2019. The Heitman venture paid $65 million for the portfolio with a $42 million loan from Truist Financial. It\u2019s unclear how much R2 paid to maintain its stake in the properties.\nThe joint venture struggled to hold onto the four assets, located at 641 West Lake Street, 901 West Jackson Boulevard and 130 South Jefferson Street, after the pandemic hit.\nMaryland-based Beltway, which specializes in buying distressed debt, bought the loan note from Truist last May, when the properties and their owners faced a murky path forward. The loan was labeled nonperforming at the time of its sale, meaning it likely traded for less than its face value.\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for distressed debt buyers to file foreclosure actions shortly after acquiring a struggling loan.\nWhen Truist put the $42 million debt on the market, R2 and Heitman hadn\u2019t technically defaulted on the loan, but it was in cash management, people familiar with the offering said. That means its excess cash flow was being used to cover debt service costs.\nIn this case, Beltway tapped R2 as its partner in managing the assets. R2 CEO Matt Garrison declined to share how much the firm invested into the portfolio to maintain its stake or what terms dictated Heitman\u2019s departure from the joint venture.\nRepresentatives of Heitman did not respond to requests for comment.\nGarrison said R2 will be investing in \u201caggressive retention efforts for existing tenants,\u201d and upgrades to common areas.\n\nIt was worth it for R2 to hang onto the assets because loft offices are often the type of buildings targeted for residential conversions, he said, meaning the number of competing properties could dwindle. Others aren\u2019t in a position to fund the costs of competing for tenants.\n\u201cMany of the (loft office) owners are undercapitalized or lack a rationale to invest capital in new leases, because their properties are worth less than the debt,\u201d Garrison said. \u201cThis makes the effective inventory even smaller. We think there will always be demand for well executed loft buildings in the West Loop, and supply and demand looks better today for the right buildings than it has in a long time.\u201d\nA few months before it bought the distressed note from Truist, Beltway also pounced on another struggling loan issued by Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada to the Feil Organization for a loft office building at 730 North Franklin Street. Beltway also partnered with R2 to take over that asset.\nNow the firms co-own all five properties outright. Debt-free buildings\nhave emerged as an appealing strategy\nfor office investors seeking flexibility in making significant building upgrades and attracting tenants with competitive lease terms.\n\u201cDebt is just financial engineering. It isn\u2019t required from this entry basis to generate great returns,\u201d Garrison said. \u201cOne of the first questions tenant reps ask is about debt. Is the building in trouble, etc. Owning a property in all cash is the best answer to this question.\u201d\nWhether the new approach will kickstart a turnaround for the full portfolio remains to be seen.\nThe office at 901 West Jackson is 90 percent occupied but the offices at 641 West\u00a0 Lake and 130 South Jefferson are 50 percent occupied. Garrison said the firm is negotiating several leases across the properties.\n\u201cIn the office business, it is hard to stay flat,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are either growing or you are declining. The Chicago office market is really two markets today, with almost half of the buildings effectively offline.\u201d\n",

The firm added 6,600 square feet in 2023.\n\nThe city\u2019s average office lease size has increased for the first time since the pandemic, a promising sign of resilience, O\u2019Leary said.\nIt\u2019s likely too soon to tell if the broader office market in Chicago is headed for a noticeable turnaround. The downtown office vacancy rate hit 26.3 percent in the fourth quarter, up from 23.8 percent at the end of 2023 and more than double the 13.8 percent rate recorded at the start of the pandemic, according to CBRE.\nHenry Crown and Co. bought the 27-story building at 222 North LaSalle for $112 million in 2006 with a $100 million loan from the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America.\nThe investment firm dates back to 1959 and is tied to one of Chicago\u2019s wealthiest families. One of its scions, the businessman and philanthropist Jim Crown, died in 2023, and his Gold Coast condo at\n65 Goethe Street\n, was listed the following year for $17.5 million.\n",

It\u2019s a sharp drop from the $60 million Gaw Capital paid for it in 2016.\nThe buyers have added the Ambassador to a cluster of independently managed hotels operated by the Chicago Hotel Collection, which also manages three other properties downtown and in Wrigleyville.\nSeller Gaw Capital invested $11 million in renovations and rebranded the hotel under the Hyatt Joie de Vivre collection in 2020.\n\nThe pandemic forced the hotel to shut down for nearly a year, and it struggled to recover amid a slow rebound for the city\u2019s hospitality sector.\nDowntown Chicago hotels remain below pre-pandemic levels, when adjusted for inflation, despite some signs of a recovery. Revenue per available room was 11 percent higher last year than in 2019, but inflation-adjusted figures show the sector still lagging, according to CoStar.\nThe buyers must stabilize the hotel\u2019s operations fast if they want to turn a profit.

        "content": "Hamilton Partners is maneuvering to save a struggling suburban Chicago office deal without getting much help from its distressed ownership companion, Accesso Partners, which faces foreclosures at a handful of properties in the area.\nItasca-based Hamilton is a minority owner of the Esplanade I, a 609,000-square-foot office complex at 2001 Butterfield Road in Downers Grove, a property that had its $69 million loan transferred last month to special servicer CW Capital, a sign of financial trouble for the landlord.\nAccesso, based in the Miami suburb of Hallandale Beach, has the larger ownership stake in the 19-story property of the two firms, but it\u2019s either unable or unwilling to commit the capital necessary to work out the debt trouble alongside Hamilton, said Hamilton partner Ron Lunt.\nAs a result, Hamilton is seeking to delay the maturity of the property\u2019s loan, which comes due in July of next year, and is starting debt workout talks with CW Capital around how to fund the costs of turning the property around, such as tenant allowances for workspace buildouts and leasing broker commissions, Lunt said.\n\u201cWe have some lease talks going, but if we\u2019re going to spend a ton of money, we would like to work out an extension of some sort,\u201d Lunt said. \u201cOffices are low priority for lenders today, which is why you need to start the discussion early.\u201d\nCW Capital declared the loan is headed toward \u201cimminent monetary default,\u201d although Lunt said the loan terms were only breached on a technicality because its previous loan servicer, Iowa-based Principal, was allowing rents to be collected and debt costs to be paid later in the month than the special servicer.\nCW is reviewing Hamilton\u2019s request for a modification to the deal terms, and it\u2019s unclear when it will come to a resolution. Accesso, meanwhile, will have its equity in the property diluted further with each dollar Hamilton kicks into the deal as it attempts to rescue the loan from the brink of distress, Lunt said.\nAccesso didn\u2019t return requests for comment. It surrendered its office tower at 20 North Clark Street in the Chicago Loop to its lender earlier this year, and it is also facing a\n$75 million foreclosure at 200 West Monroe Street\n, which is next door to a property the firm previously sold at a major loss from its previous purchase price. Accesso made other\nsuburban office investments that recently ended up in foreclosure\n, too. The firm bought several of those properties from Hamilton, and entered the Esplanade deal in a 2015 joint venture.\nAccesso also lost a\nHouston office portfolio\nto financial distress last year.\n\nThe suburban Chicago property was appraised at $105 million ($172 per square foot) in 2016, when the joint venture\u2019s commercial mortgage-backed securities loan was originated. That\u2019s far more than what it\u2019s likely worth today as interest rates and subdued demand from tenants have eaten into property values. The loan\u2019s $57.3 million balance pencils out to $94 per square foot.\nThe property\u2019s financial trouble was triggered in part by the 2023 exit of Hillshire Brands, an affiliate of Tyson Foods, that previously leased a 72,000-square-foot annex building that serves as a research and development facility on the Downers Grove campus.\nThat space hasn\u2019t been refilled, and the asset is only 72 percent leased, about average for suburban Chicago office buildings amid one of the worst downturns of all time for the sector. The lackluster occupancy has sunk the property\u2019s revenue to well below the level required to meet debt service obligations, public loan data shows.\nThe property\u2019s debt-service coverage ratio was just 0.43 for 2024 through the end of September, loan data compiled by Morningstar Credit shows \u2014 anything less than 1.0 is below breakeven, meaning the Esplanade property was bringing in less than half the rent needed to cover its costs.\nStill, Hamilton is working with a brokerage team focused on food processing companies to help lease the space Hillshire vacated, with the hope it can get the deal back on track in time to dodge penalties with its lender.\nYet it\u2019ll be vying for tenants with other office properties in the suburbs that have already been through foreclosure or deeply discounted sales in\nnearby suburban markets\n, allowing their buyers to offer lower rents in some cases, Lunt noted.\n\u201cMajor projects in\nSchaumburg\nhave gone through ownership changes and the bases are all reset, and it makes it tougher competition,\u201d Lunt said.\n",

        "content": "Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi has fixed hundreds of property misclassifications after a months-long audit, but questions remain over how many errors are still unresolved.\nAt least 620 properties were\nmisclassified or undervalued\nduring the 2023 tax year, resulting in an estimated $444 million in missed taxable value.\nThe assessor\u2019s office has since corrected 491 of those errors, adding nearly $489 million in taxable value to county rolls \u2014 about 17 percent of the new construction value added countywide in 2023, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. An investigation by Illinois Answers and the outlet reported the misclassified properties last year.\nStill, 129 properties identified in the investigation remain incorrectly classified, with fixes delayed due to a backlog at the Cook County Board of Review and what Kaegi\u2019s office described as \u201cquirks in the tax calendar.\u201d\nThe office also blamed inconsistent permit data from local municipalities as a key factor behind delayed corrections.\nThe misclassifications carried major financial consequences.\nSome homeowners, like those in suburban Lynwood, have already received back tax bills as high as $23,000 after belated reassessments. State law allows for up to three years of back taxes, though Kaegi\u2019s office maintains that it won\u2019t issue back taxes in cases where it failed to act on construction permits it had on file.\nIn 46 out of 55 back-taxed cases, Kaegi\u2019s office did have relevant permit information, but missed it.\n\nMany affected properties were either new construction or had undergone significant renovations, but the assessor\u2019s records failed to reflect those changes. In some cases, properties were still being taxed based on outdated classifications.\nFor instance, a home in Gilmore Park built in 2021 and sold for $843,000 continued to be assessed as a vacant lot, with its value listed at less than $45,000.\nKaegi\u2019s office has since hired a dozen more staffers, including two permit specialists and 10 field inspectors, and promoted a veteran staffer to oversee data integrity. The office also plans to launch a sales validation team this year to help catch discrepancies, such as multimillion-dollar sales on properties incorrectly recorded as vacant.\nKaegi is pushing for broader systemic changes.\nLast week, he\ncalled on the Federal Housing Finance Agency\nto release appraisal data from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to local assessors. Kaegi argued that access to this data \u2014\ncurrently restricted\n\u2014 would help improve the accuracy of property assessments, particularly in addressing long-standing issues like regressivity, where lower-value homes are often over-assessed relative to their market value. His office released a public dataset on Monday morning with building permits submitted to the office by municipalities, another bid to bring transparency to the process.\nCritics argue the long delays and lingering errors undermine confidence in Cook County\u2019s property tax system \u2014 especially when homeowners can be hit with massive, unexpected tax bills for mistakes they had no hand in.\nKaegi\u2019s office is reviewing the 46 back tax bills for errors, as delays in delivering the permits to the assessor\u2019s office can slow its ability to make corrections, a spokesperson said.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Chicago landlords are set up to strongarm rent hikes this year and beyond.\nLeases struck within a group of 84 downtown buildings tracked by brokerage Luxury Living\nsurpassed an average of $3,000 per month\nlast year for the first time ever. With new supply limited by developers grappling with higher interest rates and construction costs, landlords are projected to have the upper hand until 2027, the earliest that a significant wave of rental deliveries is expected.\nChicago\u2019s top city lawyers are taking aim at the\nmost negligent property owners\n, and\nThe Real Deal\nis taking a look inside their plights.\nSuzie Wilson, dubbed the city\u2019s \u201cworst landowner\u201d by public officials, is nearing a $11.5 million settlement that could also include\na ban from investing in Chicago property\n.\nThe settlement would resolve the nearly $50 million in debts and legal claims she\u2019s estimated to owe the city, and she\u2019s not alone. The city is ramping its pursuit of two more firms,\nGoldmine Investments and QCD Financial\n, that similarly assembled large portfolios of properties on the South and West sides through delinquent tax sales and racked up a combined $9 million in unpaid fines and interest owed to the city through allegedly neglecting their real estate.\n\nIn the office market, the recently stubborn CMBS spigot loosed up to\nrain down $610 million on the owners of the newly built Salesforce Tower\n, which includes Hines and Chicago-based Chris Kennedy\u2019s famous political family. The deal replaces $549 million in construction debt.\nOn the other side of the financial spectrum,\nBeacon Capital Partners\u2019 190 North LaSalle Street\nwas listed for sale with Cushman &amp; Wakefield, and, like several of its fellow office buildings in the central Loop, has potential to fall short of its debt with its ultimate sale price.\nThe\nFarpoint-led team redeveloping the former Michael Reese Hospital site\nin Bronzeville released its vision for the Chicago Bears\u2019 new stadium to be built on the land. While the NFL team hasn\u2019t expressed any interest in the site as of yet, the developer is hoping to sway the team away from its previously announced plans to either build a new stadium just south of Soldier Field or outside of the city in Arlington Heights.\nOut in the suburbs, developer\nAdvent Properties scrapped a 278-unit Des Plaines\napartments project, investor\nZell Kravinsky paid $19.3 million\nto FPA Multifamily for a 63-unit Algonquin apartment complex and FPA Multifamily turned around and bought a\nbig Naperville apartment complex for $68 million\n.\n",

        "content": "Hines, Chris Kennedy of a famous American political family and their investment partners in a 60-story skyscraper in Chicago have defied the pandemic-induced downturn for commercial office space.\nThe owners of\nSalesforce Tower\non the bank of the Chicago River are nearing the finalization of a $610 million long-term debt deal, marking a milestone in the aftermath of the pandemic-stricken economy, CoStar News\nreported\n. Should the deal close later this month as expected, the property \u2014 developed by Hines and the Kennedy family as well as the AFL-CIO\u2019s real estate investment arm \u2014 will stand as a contrarian bet that worked out amid economic uncertainty.\nThe commercial mortgage-backed securities loan reflects the tower\u2019s long-term valuation of $888 million, as appraised by Cushman &amp; Wakefield. Its current valuation of $745 million is expected to rise further following the repayment of tenant-improvement costs and free rent allowances.\nThe refinancing package, with Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs serving as the lenders, will replace the property\u2019s $549 million construction debt and is projected to carry an interest rate of 6.525 percent until its maturity in March 2030.\nConceived during the early days of the pandemic, Salesforce Tower has upended market trends by maintaining high occupancy levels, with leases covering over 95 percent of its 1.2 million square feet. Key tenants include Salesforce, which rents more than 477,000 square feet, and Kirkland &amp; Ellis, which is on a 677,000-square-foot lease; those deals run into the 2040s.\n\nMeanwhile, much of the rest of the Chicago office market is depressed, with record-high vacancy rates of more than 25 percent and\nmassive foreclosure lawsuits\nagainst office landlords winding through Cook County court.\nFor the Salesforce Tower developers and Chicago\u2019s broader office market, scoring the loan is a testament to the investment thesis that the world\u2019s largest companies remain interested in ultra-premium workspace and aren\u2019t afraid to invest heavily in it as a method to attract and retain top talent. Kirkland has poured over $207 million beyond its tenant-improvement allowance to create its ideal workspaces, while Salesforce has put up an additional $78 million for its interior buildout, the Moody\u2019s report cited by the outlet shows.\nMoody\u2019s put out a robust outlook on the deal, buoyed by a net operating income projected to reach about $51.2 million by the second year of the loan.\nEastdil Secured arranged the financing package for Salesforce Tower.\n",

        "content": "The developer with ambitious plans for the Bronzeville Lakefront put pictures with its pitch for a Chicago Bears stadium, although the team\u2019s plans are far from certain.\nFarpoint Development released renderings for a $3.2 billion domed stadium on the 49-acre site of the former Michael Reese hospital on the South Side, aiming to present an alternative to the team\u2019s two other options, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The team is also considering a redevelopment of the Arlington Heights racetrack and a domed stadium near Soldier Field.\nThe Bronzeville pitch includes an entertainment district, hotels and a 20-acre park bridging over Lake Shore Drive, connecting the stadium to the lakefront, proximity to which has been one of the National Football League team\u2019s main requirements.\nThe developer argues the site offers the best of both worlds: an urban core location and room for ancillary developments \u2014 retail, dining and multifamily projects \u2014 that could generate additional revenue for the team.\nThe stadium would be privately financed by the Bears, but the developer is pitching $600 million in state infrastructure funds to prepare the site for development, including utilities, roads and environmental work.\nThat departs from\nthe Bears\u2019 other lakefront proposal\n, which sought a $900 million upfront public subsidy. By financing the stadium privately, developers see the plan as more palatable to political leaders wary of direct public subsidies.\n\nStill, hurdles remain. The Bears haven\u2019t publicly engaged with the proposal as of late, but\nrescinded a rejection in the fall\nafter Farpoint updated its plans to take out a conflict with Metra tracks it previously planned to build over.\nInsiders suggest the team is still focused on either advancing its lakefront vision or moving forward in Arlington Heights. The narrow footprint of the Michael Reese site has also raised concerns about feasibility.\nAnother complication is the adjacent Prairie Shores apartment complex, partially owned by Farpoint. The developer says the stadium could fit without impacting the complex, but demolishing units has been floated as a way to maximize the site \u2014 an option that would likely draw political pushback.\nThe city still owns the majority of the site and would need to contribute land, as well as cover about $40 million in debt tied to its acquisition. Public financing could also come from tax increment financing and leveraging the site\u2019s federal opportunity zone status.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

The lawsuit, which is seeking class-action status, was filed Thursday in federal court in Massachusetts.\nThe South Suburban Housing Center and Open Communities in Evanston received the same letter and faces similar funding losses posed to disrupt decades of work supporting low-income and minority communities.\nThe nonprofit lost its two grants, which totaled about $1.4 million over the next three years, funds it has received since 1995. The amount represented 92 percent of its fair housing budget and 37 percent of its total organizational budget.\n\nChicago\u2019s Continuum of Care network \u2014 responsible for coordinating housing services for the homeless \u2014 has over $112 million in HUD grants still pending contracts. At least 14 organizations have been operating without reimbursement since January.\nThe cuts come amid broader federal workforce reductions at HUD, including layoffs at the agency\u2019s Chicago office.\nHUD Secretary Scott Turner, who was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on Feb. 5, has defended the changes, saying the agency is \u201ctaking inventory\u201d to improve efficiency. HUD officials have promised some clarity in the coming weeks, with letters to awardees expected soon.\nThe cuts are targeting racial justice initiatives and could erode protections for vulnerable groups, particularly as\nhousing discrimination\ncomplaints rise and\naffordable housing options shrink\n, the National Fair Housing Alliance said.\nFor other organizations, like Ignite, which provides services for homeless youth as the parent organization for Continuum of Care, the clock is ticking.\nIgnite has dipped into reserves to continue operations while awaiting its yearly $320,000 contract reimbursement. Others are turning to donors or state-level funding to close the gaps.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "A venture involving Zell Kravinsky\u2019s Morning Sky Capital scooped up a 63-unit apartment complex on the bank of the Fox River in the northwest suburbs of Chicago from multifamily giant Greg Fowler\u2019s firm, which previously bought it out of distress.\nKravinsky\u2019s company partnered with several other investors to pay $19.3 million for the ReNew on Main property at 1 North Main Street in Algonquin, public records show. The price of $302,000 per unit included assuming an existing mortgage with a balance of more than $11 million that the San Francisco-based seller, FPA Multifamily, previously took out on the property, sparing the buyer from shopping for debt at today\u2019s elevated interest rates.\nFor FPA, one of Chicagoland\u2019s largest multifamily landlords, the deal extends a streak of activity in the area that has tended to follow the same pattern: the firm is\nselling off its smaller assets\nand buying up bigger ones with funds the transactions generate. The Algonquin deal closed right as\nFPA bought a 356-unit Naperville apartment complex\nfor $68 million, in another deal where it assumed the existing debt of the seller, Chicago-based Rockwell Partners.\n\u201cThere is not a lot of liquidity in the market right now, which is good for people who have a conviction in the market and are ready to make a bet,\u201d said Morning Sky\u2019s Lev Kravinsky. \u201cIn general most of what we\u2019re buying nowadays is either all cash or loan assumption. It\u2019s difficult but not impossible to find deals that pencil with fresh debt.\u201d\nFPA didn\u2019t return a request for comment on the Algonquin transaction.\nWhile the deal is relatively small for FPA, the seller posted a gain on the property after buying it out of distress in 2018 for $12.7 million ($201,600 per unit). The complex, which also includes six ground-floor retail units, has a checkered ownership history after running into delays during its development, and financial trouble after its 2011 completion.\n\nFPA bought it from a financial institution, Boston-based UC Funds, which acquired the property through foreclosure. The property was conceived as a 54-unit luxury condo project, awarded to Aspen Homebuilders back in 2006 by the village of Algonquin. Aspen went bankrupt two years later, and the firm\u2019s owner, Bruce Hawkins, pleaded guilty in 2013 to defrauding a bank of more than $1 million, the Northwest Herald previously\nreported\n.\nThe building remained unfinished for years, until developer John Bruegelmans took over the project in 2011 and gained approval to convert the project into rentals. Residents started moving in during 2015, but Buregelmans filed for bankruptcy in 2016 to restructure construction debt, the newspaper reported.\nThat\u2019s what prompted a UC Funds entity to take over the building and eventually sell it to FPA.\nMeanwhile, buyers in Chicago and its suburban multifamily markets are\nset to raise rents\nin the coming year as new supply craters amid a development dropoff.\nMorning Sky owns several other apartment complexes in the area, with three in the suburbs and one in the city, Lev Kravinsky said. His father, Morning Sky principal Zell Kravinsky, is well-known as a philanthropist and longtime real estate investor.\n",

        "content": "Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi is pushing the federal government to release property appraisal data to the country\u2019s largest assessors to help improve the accuracy of property tax assessments, which have received criticism locally for being systemically flawed.\nA resolution sponsored by Kaegi calls for the Federal Housing Finance Agency to hand data containing \u201cmillions of property appraisals\u201d over to 16 of the nation\u2019s largest assessment offices, according to a news release.\nThe assessor made the request just a day before the Senate on Thursday confirmed President Trump\u2019s nominee\nBill Pulte as head of the FHFA\n, which collects appraisal records from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Pulte\u2019s stance on Kaegi\u2019s idea is unclear; Pulte is the grandson of the late William Pulte, who started one of the nation\u2019s largest homebuilders, Pulte Homes, in Detroit in the 1950s.\nThe Federal Housing Finance Agency compiles Fannie and Freddie appraisals into a Uniform Appraisal Dataset that contains parcel-level property characteristics. Most of this data is inaccessible to government assessors, but Kaegi and 15 other assessment offices across the country are hoping to change that.\nThe Kaegi-backed proposal\u2019s supporters said it would aid in addressing a common problem encountered by Cook County homeowners: Less expensive homes tend to be overvalued for taxes relative to their actual sale price, while pricier homes tend to be undervalued for taxes in an issue known as \u201cregressivity.\u201d\n\nThis means that working class and low income families end up paying more than their fair share in property taxes or can\u2019t pay at all, putting a strain on the local municipality that relies on property tax revenue to fund public services. This has been\nparticularly true for small towns in the South suburbs of Chicago\nthat have a higher concentration of working class homeowners hit with overvaluations.\n\u201cIn recent years, we\u2019ve eliminated a large portion of the regressivity in Cook County\u2019s residential assessments,\u201d Kaegi said in the release. \u201cWith the release of this data, we would be able to clear one of the final hurdles to achieving thoroughly fair and accurate assessments.\u201d\nA 2022 University of Chicago\nstudy cited the main causes of regressivity as \u201climitations in the data and methods used in assessment,\u201d specifically a lack of data about property characteristics that might factor into calculating a property\u2019s assessed value. A study by Josh Myers Valuation Solutions also attributed\nthe undervaluation of commercial properties\n, in part, to \u201clack of data-sharing.\u201d\nThe resolution got a boost from the National Association of Counties\u2019 Board of Directors, which endorsed the measure in a March 1 annual legislative conference, according to the release. Kaegi\u2019s co-sponsor on the bill is Eddie Cook, the assessor of Maricopa County, Arizona, which includes the city of Phoenix.\n",

The price wasn\u2019t disclosed.\nBeacon acquired the nearly 800,000-square-foot tower in late 2019 for $230 million ($288 per square foot) and is selling at a time when Loop office buildings are trading at significant discounts. A $167.5 million mortgage ($209 per square foot) from U.S. Bank also weighs it down \u2014 a balance that now likely exceeds the property\u2019s market value amid rising vacancies and declining demand.\nTwo of the building\u2019s largest tenants, Neuberger Berman and Bain &amp; Company, are expected to exit by 2027 and 2028, respectively.\nThe looming vacancies add to the building\u2019s uncertainty despite its anchor tenant U.S. Bank\u2019s signing through 2030. The weighted average lease term across tenants is just over four years, according to marketing materials.\n\nThe sale offer comes after Beacon\u2019s\nloss on 303 East Wacker Drive\n, which sold in December for about $63 million, a steep drop from the $182 million Beacon paid in 2018. Another blow came with a foreclosure lawsuit at 330 North Wabash Avenue, where Beacon faces claims over a $372 million loan after its appraisal\ndropped 62 percent last month\nfrom issuance four years ago.\nBeacon recently invested $13.7 million in renovating 190 South LaSalle, upgrading the lobby, fitness center and conference spaces in hopes of attracting tenants.\nThe building, developed in 1987 and designed by Philip Johnson, is one of the few LaSalle Street properties to undergo significant recent updates. That list includes 135 South LaSalle Street, for which the city doled out $98 million in TIF subsidies to Riverside Investment &amp; Development, DL3 Realty and AmTrust RE to convert vacant office space into 386 residential units\nlast fall\n.\nSeveral nearby towers have fallen into foreclosure, like New York-based landlord Feil Organization\u2019s 10 South LaSalle Street.

The figure ranged from 61 percent to 77 percent between 2019 and 2022.\nSimilarly, the North Chicago Housing Authority reported a 50 percent lease-up rate last year, while the Lake County Housing Authority logged 62 percent. Some recipients are still searching for homes, meaning these rates could shift.\nThe struggle to find housing can be grueling for voucher holders, who may have to sleep in their cars or couch surf, shower at the gym and store personal items at work. Once they are approved for vouchers, the clock is ticking, and time can run out before they find housing.\n\nSome housing authorities are adopting strategies to address the problems. Housing authorities in Waukegan, North Chicago and Lake County last year agreed to allow voucher holders to lease units in any of their jurisdictions, aiming to expand options and increase lease-up rates.\nWaukegan and Lake County have also received HUD approval to offer monetary incentives to landlords.\nMeanwhile, landlords cite barriers like bureaucratic delays, inspections and a lack of standardization across housing authorities. Some housing providers have called for streamlining the process through faster unit approvals and more consistent administrative standards.\nNationally, about 60 percent of voucher holders are able to lease units, according to New York University\u2019s Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy.\nThe rates are lower in markets with older housing stock and among recipients of color \u2014 two conditions that especially apply in Chicago.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

They did not immediately reply to a request for comment via a representative.\nAI has been touted as the likely taker for a substantial portion of San Francisco\u2019s one-third-empty office space. There were\n86 AI leases signed last year\nin the city, according to Kilroy analysis, with AI expected to drive another 1 million to 1.5 million square feet in absorption this year. Tech office leasing was up 17 percent last year,\ndriven by AI\ndemand, according to CBRE.\nAI companies are \u201cabsolutely\u201d having an impact on the office market, Walker said, adding that with 5 million square feet of leased space, the city\u2019s 200 AI companies represent nearly 9% of the total occupied office space in the city.\n\u201cThese AI companies recognize the strategic value of being in San Francisco\u2014not just for access to talent and investors, but for building in-office cultures that will help shape the future of downtown,\u201d he said.\nIf more of these AI companies come to SoMa, it would be a much-needed boost to the neighborhood, which has been\nhit harder than other SF markets\nby tech\u2019s office retreat since the pandemic. At the end of 2024, SoMa was 40 percent vacant, compared to 36.5 percent citywide, according to CBRE data.\n",

        "content": "The dominoes of department stores and boutique shops falling around San Francisco\u2019s Union Square may include another luxury retail store: Saks Fifth Avenue.\nCanada-based Hudson Bay Company, which owns Saks, appears ready to cut the cord for its appointment-only store at 384 Post Street when its lease expires in 2027,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported\n.\nThe move comes after an affiliate of Hudson Bay, Saks Global Enterprises, picked up the Union Square flagship store from Neiman Marcus late last year at 150 Stockton Street during its acquisition of Neiman Marcus and its real estate properties for\n$2.7 billion\n.\nThe transfer of the six-story, 208,900-square-foot building at 150 Stockton assigned a new market value of $160 million, or $766 per square foot, according to public records and an unidentified source.\nThat left Saks, which for decades has leased a 136,000-square-foot building at 384 Post diagonally across the street from Neiman, vulnerable.\nSaks Fifth Avenue faces an expiring lease in January\u00a0 2027, Charlie McCabe, a locally based real estate investment broker, told the Chronicle. The department store\u2019s ongoing tenure in that building \u201cmay be tenuous,\u201d he said.\nSaks pays more than $6 million a year in rent to landlord Lincoln Property, based in Dallas. Last summer, Saks laid off workers as it converted the store to\n\u201cappointment only,\u201d\ncurtailing its retail clout in Union Square.\nKazuko Morgan, a veteran retail broker who specializes in leasing around Union Square, said that she was told Saks doesn\u2019t plan to renew its lease \u2014 and hasn\u2019t heard that Saks could move in with Neiman Marcus across the street.\n\n\u201cIf Saks does exit the market, it\u2019s not such a terrible thing today, since they have been appointment-only for months,\u201d Morgan told the newspaper. \u201cThey\u2019ve already diminished their presence.\u201d\nLincoln Property and Germany-based Cara Investment bought the building in 2021 for $156 million, or $115 per square foot. They now plan to redevelop it as \u201cmixed use,\u201d Morgan said.\nThe loss of Saks could be inscribed into a larger retail tombstone for greater Union Square, once the city\u2019s golden shopping district.\nNordstrom, which for decades anchored the mall at 865 Powell Street, packed up in 2023. Bloomgindale\u2019s, which occupied more than 300,000 square-feet at the nearly empty San Francisco Centre mall,\nwill close this month\n.\nMacy\u2019s, which for decades has occupied its three-building flagship store in Union Square plaza, plans to\nsell the property and close the doors\nof its only San Francisco store.\nOther retailers that have pulled up stakes include Saks Off Fifth, Nordstrom Rack, H&amp;M and Uniqlo, according to the Chronicle. Meanwhile, luxury retailers may be drifting over to historic Jackson Square.\nThis month, Ralph Lauren has returned to San Francisco with a\nnew store at 441 Jackson Street\n, following an\ninflux of luxury retailers\nlike Paul Smith, Isabel Marant and Zimmermann.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "Architect-turned-builder Lara Dutto plans to build 15 homes next to a war memorial of thousands of white wooden crosses in Lafayette.\nDutto, principal of Orinda-based Laraarchitecture, bought the\nLafayette Hillside Memorial\nat 3600 Deer Hill Road two years ago to save the 3.1-acre parcel from development,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported\n.\nNow Dutto, a professor of architecture at Diablo Valley College, has pitched a plan to develop 15 homes on the northern two-thirds of the site.\nShe wants to split off the southern portion to preserve the memorial conceived in 2006 by contractor Jeff Heaton as a \u201cplace to recognize, honor, and commemorate individual national service contribution\u201d of those dying in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\nNonprofit Lafayette Hillside Memorial would continue to maintain the crosses.\n\u201cIts scale and rawness and simplicity somehow makes me stop, forces me to take a deep breath, and in that moment I am so grateful for my freedoms,\u201d she told the Chronicle.\nDutto, who has worked since 2010 to support the memorial and once sat on its board, grew concerned when the family that owned it put it up for sale, fearful that whoever bought it would remove the crosses. So she bought it in 2023 for an undisclosed price.\nPlans now call for preserving the memorial and half the property as open space, while building a subdivision of 15 single-family homes around a \u201cvillage green,\u201d with an outdoor cooking and dining area, according to the Chronicle.\nFive of the homes would have accessory dwelling units, or granny flats. The development would climb up the slope along Oak Hill Road, below a ridgeline of preserved open space.\n\nDutto has employed a state density bonus and Senate Bill 330 for streamlined approvals. On Monday, the Lafayette Planning Commission was slated to hold an informational hearing.\nThe application came as housing advocates\nsued the East Bay city\nfor creating \u201cmisleading and unrealistic housing sites\u201d to satisfy state-mandated housing goals.\nThe lawsuit by the Housing Action Coalition accused Lafayette of \u201cpretending\u201d to comply with the state housing element, a planning blueprint required of every city and county across the state every eight years.\nMayor Susan Candell took issue with the lawsuit, according to the Chronicle, saying the City Council has approved all housing projects that have come before it. She said the city will have no choice but to approve the Deer Hill Road project.\nLafayette, a wealthy city with $2 million homes, was once a battleground for the region\u2019s housing wars, with two lawsuits, a ballot referendum and more than 100 public hearings that delayed a 315-unit apartment building for almost a dozen years.\nWithin a 10-year span, 115 homes were built in the city of 25,000 residents, including 10 in 2010, 76 in 2018 and 29 in 2019. The city must rezone to build 2,114 homes, 943 of them affordable, by 2031.\nLast year, the\nstate Supreme Court declined\nto hear an appeal from a neighborhood group, allowing the development to move forward. The project has not broken ground.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

A previous 19-story hotel and fitness club project, approved in 2021, stalled.\n\u201cThis started out as a contrarian bet but as we dug in deeper and looked at the market, how it is evolving and maturing out of Covid, it doesn\u2019t seem so contrarian any more,\u201d Gino Canori, president of Related California, told the San Francisco Chronicle.\nRelated hopes to secure approvals to build the tower this fall, allowing the firm to break ground by late next year. If all goes well, it could be completed by 2030.\nMichelin-starred chef, Ralph Lauren come to Jackson Square\nRestaurateur Peter Hemsley of Michelin-starred Aphotic\njoined forces\nwith developer Brick &amp; Timber, which keeps its headquarters in the neighborhood, to buy a 15,600-square-foot store and building at 530 Jackson Street for $32.4 million, or over $2,000 a square foot.\n\nHemsley announced last year he would shut Aphotic, blaming the SoMa location. It\u2019s not clear whether the chef intends to revive the sustainable seafood restaurant or launch a new concept in the ground-floor space that was home to Kells Irish Restaurant and Pub for decades. Paul McAleese is the owner of Kells Irish Restaurant and Bar as well as the seller of 530 Jackson.\nJust down the street from 530 Jackson, Ralph Lauren opened its first new store in the city in years.\n\u201cThe opening of Polo Ralph Lauren in Jackson Square is a testament to the neighborhood\u2019s growing appeal as a premier destination for retail,\u201d Robbie Silver, CEO of the Downtown SF Partnership, said in a statement.\nSweetgreen, Blue Bottle sign long-term Mission Rock leases\nIn further retail news, Mission Rock developers Tishman Speyer and the San Francisco Giants announced\ntwo new long-term deals\nat their Mission Bay development. Blue Bottle Coffee and Sweetgreen have signed 10-year leases at Mission Rock and Arsicault bakery finally opened its doors in the development.\nOakland-founded Blue Bottle will occupy 2,069 square feet at the base of the building occupied by Visa at 300 Toni Stone Crossing. Salad-and-grain bowl shop Sweetgreen will take just under 2,400 square feet at the base of The Canyon, a residential tower at the intersection of Dr. Maya Angelou Lane and Toni Strone Crossing.\nAlex Sagues and Madeline Mandanis represented the landlords in the deal. Sagues called Mission Bay \u201cthe most vibrant neighborhood in San Francisco\u201d. He said retailers are drawn to the transit-friendly area because \u201cit is a true seven-day neighborhood,\u201d with office, life sciences, residential, and the UCSF hospital, as well as events at Chase Center and Oracle Park.\n",

        "content": "State insurance regulators have unveiled a new plan to stabilize the home insurance market by pushing insurers to expand coverage in fire-prone areas where companies have dropped hundreds of thousands of homeowners in recent years.\nThe plan updates a map of high-risk zip codes where insurers will be required to write more policies, aiming to create a more equitable insurance market despite growing wildfire threats, the\nSan Jose Mercury News reported\n.\nHowever, many high-risk Bay Area neighborhoods, including Oakland, the Berkeley Hills and Gilroy, aren\u2019t included in the updated map.\nState regulators say this is because those areas fall within zip codes where the overall insurance need is deemed lower. Despite this, new rules will still require insurers to offer coverage to homeowners in these areas who have been rejected by traditional providers due to fire risk.\n\u201cInsurance companies have ignored those homes, and we\u2019re trying to put the spotlight on them,\u201d Michael Soller, spokesperson for the California Department of Insurance, told the Mercury News.\nThe plan stems from a deal with the insurance industry, allowing companies to raise rates based on climate-related risks in exchange for expanding coverage in high-risk areas.\nCalifornians currently pay an average of $1,435 annually for homeowners insurance, below the national average. But prices vary widely. And insurers like State Farm and Allstate have stopped issuing new policies in the state, citing strict rate-setting rules and wildfire losses.\nThe new rules require insurers to cover a proportional share of high-risk policies. For example, if a company covers 100 of every 1,000 policies statewide, it must cover 85 of every 1,000 in high-risk areas.\n\nHowever, some consumer groups argue the reforms have loopholes that may allow insurers to delay meeting these targets or only slightly increase coverage.\nHomeowners in fire-prone areas, like Carolyn Grote of the Berkeley Hills, are preparing independently. Grote formed a \u201cFirewise community\u201d with neighbors to improve fire safety, hoping to retain her insurance.\n\u201cIf Firewise could help people retain their insurance, that might be the biggest motivator,\u201d she told the newspaper.\nConsumer groups are skeptical.\n\u201cInsurers can use secret models to raise rates right away with unenforceable promises to expand coverage,\u201d Carmen Balber of nonprofit Consumer Watchdog told the Mercury News.\nRegulators, however, insist they will monitor compliance closely and can revoke rate-setting privileges if insurers fail to meet coverage requirements.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "SAJ Development wants to swing a wrecking ball into three office buildings in Lafayette to erect a 90-unit apartment building in an upscale city long opposed to affordable housing.\nThe locally based developer filed revised plans to replace the offices with a seven-story, 171,400-square-foot complex at 1001 Oak Hill Road,\nthe San Francisco Business Times reported\n. The city will consider the project on March 17.\nThe application came as housing advocates\nsued the East Bay city\nfor creating \u201cmisleading and unrealistic housing sites\u201d to satisfy state-mandated housing goals. The lawsuit by the Housing Action Coalition accused Lafayette of \u201cpretending\u201d to comply with the state housing element, a planning blueprint required of every city and county across the state every eight years.\nLafayette\u2019s alleged shell game includes relying on faith-based institutions and longtime businesses with no plans to develop housing as potential building sites for homes, according to the complaint.\nThe lawsuit seeks a court to compel the city to adopt a revised plan with an update to its zoning laws. The city must rezone to build 2,114 homes, 943 of them affordable, by 2031. Within the decade through 2019, the city permitted 115 homes.\nSAJ could help remedy that by its mixed-use project calling for 79 market-rate apartments and 11 affordable apartments, including five for very-low-income households and six for moderate-income households.\nWhat appears to be a U-shaped complex, designed by Berkeley-based Trachtenberg Architects, would be draped in two shades of brown, with tiered roof decks, and floor-to-ceiling corner windows with exterior balconies, according to a rendering.\nThe developer would employ a nearly 23 percent state density bonus in exchange for the affordable housing, plus a state streamlining law for faster approvals. A cost and timeline for construction were not disclosed.\n\nSAJ applied using Senate Bill 330, which effectively freezes zoning that\u2019s in place at the time a project is submitted, limits the number of public hearings to five and suspends or eliminates restrictions on housing development.\nThe law aims to prevent cities from delaying projects unnecessarily over subjective standards, along with several other laws meant to stop cities from blocking affordable housing.\nThe developer had submitted an earlier version of the project in 2022 that called for tearing down just two of the three offices to build\n53 units\n. City officials approved that version in May, before SAJ revised its plans. Jeff Stone, owner of Diamond Construction, was listed as the property owner operating through SAJ Development, according to SFYimby.\nLafayette was once a battleground for the region\u2019s housing wars, with two lawsuits, a ballot referendum and more than 100 public hearings that delayed a 315-unit apartment building for almost a dozen years.\nLast year, the\nstate Supreme Court declined\nto hear an appeal from a neighborhood group, allowing the development to move forward. The project has not broken ground.\nMembership in SAJ Development, led by Stone, includes Diamond Swope Holdings, the Steven Kay Trust, the Griggs Community Property Trust and Outdo, based in Lafayette, according to state business records. Another firm, Valley Oak Capital, is based in Texas.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

In 1921, it tried to redevelop it into a mixed-use village, with homes and commercial properties, according to its website.\nA default notice filed this week gives the Zappettinis 90 days to pay off the default amount. If they fail, the lender will record a notice of sale, Steven Hoffman, a real estate attorney based in Sunnyvale who is not connected to the situation, told the Business Journal.\nThe Business Journal reported in February that the\nMountain View tech campus had been heading toward foreclosure\nor a loan modification after the owner defaulted on a $120 million mortgage debt.\nLoan servicer reports obtained in January showed Zappettini Investment Company failed to repay the mortgage debt by its June 2024 maturity date. The initial loan default was\nfirst reported by The Real Deal\nthat month.\nCiti Real Estate Funding issued the two loans \u2014 one for $65 million and a second for $55 million \u2014 and then pooled them into commercial mortgage-backed securities deals.\n\nAs of last summer, leases for 40 percent of the tech park\u2019s office, light-industrial and research and development buildings were set to expire within six months, a key factor in the default.\nThe Zappettini family was originally in the wholesale flower importing business and formerly used some of the Mountain View properties for its wholesale operations, according to its website.\nThe Zappettinis sold multiple parcels in Mountain View to Google in 2011, which the tech giant sold a few years later to the Irvine Company, according to public records. They sold another property to Google in 2016 for its now-abandoned\nGoogle Landings\nproject.\nThe family also owned almost 2 acres in the San Francisco Flower Mart from the 1950s until they sold it to Kilroy Realty in 2016 for $31 million in cash and $56 million in stock.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Fielder\u2019s motion to continue the vote passed unanimously, with a hearing set for March 18.\nThe Empty Homes Tax took effect at the beginning of last year, with collections planned for upcoming April.\n\nProponents estimated it would generate more than $20 million a year for housing and unlock about 5,000 units within two years, though critics have questioned the projections.\nThe tax has faced legal challenges since February 2023, when property owner groups filed a lawsuit alleging it was coercive and infringed on their rights.\nIn December 2023, Superior Court Judge Charles Haines\ndeclined to dismiss the lawsuit\narguing in a ruling that property owners don\u2019t need to wait until the tax is due to challenge it in court. In October, Haines\nstruck down the tax\n, saying that it violated the U.S. and California constitutions and was preempted by California law.\nThe court subsequently ordered the city to halt enforcement and collection, and the city treasurer stated that property owners would not be required to pay by the original April 30, 2025 deadline unless the court\u2019s decision is reversed on appeal.\nThe city attorney\u2019s office is now appealing the ruling and has expressed disappointment with the trial court\u2019s decision.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Aghamiri\u2019s Msasa Properties\nfiled plans in September 2023\nto build the seven-story complex near San Jose\u2019s Japantown.\nWith developers having built no market-rate projects larger than 20 units in the city last year, Aghamiri\u2019s project appears to be the first large-scale multifamily development since 2023, in which 336 units were built.\nPlans call for 118 apartments on a half-acre north of Basset Street between North First and North Second streets, with six set aside as affordable for very low-income households. Parking would be available for 74 cars.\nInitial plans by Aghamiri included 18 affordable units, or 15 percent, but he cut it to 5 percent to make the project pencil out, according to Erik Schoennauer, a local land use consultant who spoke on behalf of the developer.\n\nThe project, designed by Oakland-based Studio T-Square, features a charcoal and white complex with balconies, according to a rendering, bookended by a brown brick sections.\nThe site is located in an opportunity zone, which offers tax advantages to developers.\nAghamiri bought the office property in 2022 for $5.3 million, or $442 per square foot.\nThe 61-year-old offices have been vacant for 10 months, and have been damaged by vandals, Schoennauer said. They\u2019ve been 60 percent vacant for more than five years\nHe said Aghamiri hopes to break ground this summer, and complete the project in 20 to 24 months.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "A proposed legal settlement over the botched environmental cleanup of Hunters Point Shipyard would leave thousands of affected residents with just $606 per person.\nA federal judge denied the agreement between developers FivePoint Holdings and Lennar and lawyers behind the $1 billion lawsuit \u2014 calling it a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d for the builders and the \u201cworst settlement\u201d he\u2019s ever seen, the\nSan Francisco Chronicle reported.\nIn a scathing order, U.S. District Judge James Donato called the proposed payout to 6,500 residents of Hunters Point \u201cpaltry,\u201d and accused the plaintiff\u2019s lawyers of selling out their clients.\n\u201cNo question that the proposed terms are unfair to the class members,\u201d he said during a January hearing.\nResidents of Hunters Point filed a lawsuit in 2018 alleging they were the victims of fraud and had suffered health defects in connection with the former shipyard\u2019s ongoing toxic cleanup.\nIn the latest attempt by Irvine-based FivePoint and Miami-based Lennar to settle, the developers and Sausalito law firm Bonner &amp; Bonner had asked the court to approve a $5.4 million deal.\nBut with $1.4 million for attorney fees and $4 million in community payouts, it worked out to $606 per person. A settlement proposal in 2022 for 9,000 residents, also rejected by the judge, would have worked out to $400 per person.\nDonato accused the residents\u2019 attorneys, Charles and Cabral Bonner, of colluding against Tetra Tech EC, a third defendant in the lawsuit but left out of the settlement talks. The unit of Tetra Tech was hired two decades ago to\nclean hazardous radiation and toxic substances\nfrom the shipyard once owned by the U.S. Navy.\nThe developers and the Bonners had entered into a \u201ccommon interest agreement,\u201d which allows parties with shared legal interests to share information in order to collaborate on defense strategies. But the judge said the residents and developers are \u201cadverse parties\u201d who cut a deal to target Tetra Tech EC.\nSuch a settlement \u201cbecomes collusive when it is aimed to injure the interests\u201d of an absent defendant, Donato said.\n\nThe Bonners have denied wrongdoing, saying they acted in the best interest of their clients by collaborating with the developers. Lennar declined to comment to the Chronicle, while FivePoint didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nSam Singer, a spokesperson for Pasadena-based Tetra Tech EC said: \u201cThe judge\u2019s order speaks for itself.\u201d\nAfter signing the common interest agreement, the Bonners amended the residents\u2019 complaint for the sixth time. The changes \u201cdrastically narrowed plaintiff\u2019s claims against the home builder defendants, dropped the class allegations against them, and deleted the damages demand of $1 billion,\u201d Donato wrote in his order.\n\u201cThe evidence of collusion is striking,\u201d Donato wrote. During the hearing, he questioned why the developers should be allowed to exit a $1 billion lawsuit in exchange for \u201cpaying nickels.\u201d\nFivePoint, a spinoff of Lennar, has entitlements for thousands of homes and millions of square feet of commercial space at Hunter\u2019s Point.\nA trial date for the case is set for next year, but the Bonners said they are talking with the developers about another settlement deal, and\nreached out to Tetra Tech EC\nto \u201csee if they are interested in negotiating.\u201d\nTetra Tech EC has faced\nmultiple ongoing lawsuits\nrelated to the cleanup of the 500-acre shipyard site, including a lawsuit filed by the developers in 2020. This year, the U.S. Department of Justice agreed to settle a lawsuit brought against the contractor a decade ago, originally by whistleblowers, for\n$97 million\n, according to the Chronicle.\nThe Navy previously said in other court filings that the \u201cnegative fiscal impact\u201d of the fraud at the shipyard is between\n$370 million and $570 million\n.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "When Tony Prophet joined Salesforce as its chief equality officer in 2016, he wanted the \u201creal urban experience of living in San Francisco,\u201d which he didn\u2019t associate with the city\u2019s\ntraditional high-end neighborhoods\non the north side of town. Instead he went into\nSoMa\n, \u201ceyes wide open,\u201d buying a 7,000-square-foot top-floor condo at 9 Bernice Street for just over $7 million in November 2016.\n\u201cNo surprises,\u201d he said of his time living with his then-wife and their son at the semi-industrial location near Rainbow Grocery and the DNA Lounge. \u201cWe knew everything\u2014all the good and the challenges that we were in for\u2014and saw some real improvements along the way.\u201d\nNearly a decade later and with more than $1 million poured into creating a wind-shielded roof deck with astroturf and a fire pit, Prophet is hoping his condo will break West SOMA residential records, with an asking price of $8.8 million.\nA price of about $1,250 per square foot is not out of step for the neighborhood. But because there are not many condos or even single-family homes as big as 9 Bernice, there are seldom sales above $5 million. So while it\u2019s \u201cimpossible to replicate what\u2019s been done here,\u201d according to Compass agent Butch Haze, who is listing the skylit two-level loft with three bedrooms, 3.5 baths, a wine room, and a glass-enclosed gym, it\u2019s also nearly impossible to find comps.\n\u201cYou really have to compare it to buying a warehouse and what it would take to do the TIs,\u201d he said, adding that the turnkey aspect is \u201cbaked in\u201d to the asking price.\nThere are added perks as well. The condo includes the elaborate light fixtures and large-scale furniture, almost entirely from Restoration Hardware, including a 16-seat dining table that was craned in by the previous owner, luxury retailer Wilkes-Bashford co-owner Tyler Mitchell.\n\n\u201cNot everyone loves Restoration Hardware, but nobody hates it,\u201d said Prophet, who built on interior designer Ken Fulk\u2019s work for Mitchell.\nThe new price marks a big drop from the last time the condo was on the market in 2022, when it was listed at just under $11 million. The home didn\u2019t find a buyer at the time, but Prophet had already moved to Florida so his son could attend IMG, a sports academy about an hour south of Tampa. For the last two years, he has rented it to a foursome of entrepreneurs from the start up world. Haze said the new price had to speak to today\u2019s \u201cvalue-driven buyer.\u201d\n\u201cWe wanted to price it where the price per square foot is just too attractive,\u201d Haze said.\nThere are a lot of early stage businesses walking distance from the property, Prophet added, which borders the Mission, Potero Hill and the Design District. The \u201cperfect fit\u201d would be someone who is excited by the idea of walking to work and entertaining in the enormous space, he said.\nProphet said he hosted everything from fundraisers for London Breed and the Women\u2019s HIV Program at UCSF to media events for Salesforce during his time there. He left Salesforce in 2021, and now sits on the board at Dolby Labs and is an investor and board member for an AI-assisted sales platform called Aviso.\nThe likely buyer for this home probably also sits on a lot of boards, Haze said, and is in their 50s or 60s but still active in tech or finance. They probably already own more traditional homes outside the city, but are looking for something different. It may be somebody that has \u201cflirted with\u201d the north side of the city or Noe Valley, but can\u2019t pass up the outside-the-box offering.\n\u201cThey want to have fun in a really cool, almost superhero lair in San Francisco that wows all their friends,\u201d he said.\nThat\u2019s a very specific buyer profile, but Prophet said he can be patient until the right person comes along.\n\u201cIt\u2019s super special for someone who sees that opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the same situation when we bought it: a unique property and a high price point.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Two major San Francisco apartment building trades by longtime owners have closed in the first few months of the year, including the $35 million sale of the block-long Normandy Apartments, just behind the famed St. Mary\u2019s Cathedral.\nThe early spring sales are further signs of\nnew life in the market\nthat agents saw beginning in the latter half of last year.\nThe seller of the 1968-built 108-unit complex at 1135-1175 Ellis Street was a partnership called Normandy Apartments that goes back to at least the 1990s, according to city records. The buyer was affordable housing developer Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation, which bought the property with funding from the San Francisco Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing and Community Development and is planning a major renovation. The MOHCD confirmed the $35 million price.\nThe Jan. 31 acquisition will create \u201cpermanently affordable units in the City\u2019s Western Addition neighborhood for families, individuals, couples, older adults, and long-term residents within a variety of ethnic and racial backgrounds,\u201d according to a TNDC announcement. With the exception of one manager\u2019s unit, all apartments will be restricted to households not to exceed 120 percent of the city\u2019s area median income with an average of 80 percent of the city\u2019s AMI. In 2024, 80 percent of AMI would mean that a single person making up to $83,900 would be eligible, for example, while a household with three people could make up to $107,900, according to the MOHCD website.\nA November 2024 MOHCD memo about TNDC\u2019s request for just over $52 million in permanent financing for the purchase and rehabilitation of the nearly 70,000-square-foot property said the building is in \u201cgood condition\u201d and 90 percent occupied. The planned rehabilitation will focus on fire and life safety upgrades and accessibility and ADA upgrades and requirements.\nColliers agent Brad Lagomarsino represented the sellers and said that TNDC and MOHCD \u201cseized the rare opportunity to purchase 108 units in the heart of San Francisco\u201d. He added that the nearly 1.5-acre lot\u00a0 \u201coffers tremendous development potential that justifies the price paid for the asset.\u201d\n\nIn another early spring sale after a decades-long hold, a 36-unit Nob Hill apartment building traded for the first time since it was built in 1954, according to public records. The price was $14.5 million, or just over $400,000 per unit, according to the transfer tax on the sale. That\u2019s above the average of about $340,000 per unit in San Francisco in 2024, according to Colliers data.\nColliers listing agent Dustin Dolby said he could not comment on the Feb. 18 sale due to a non-disclosure agreement, but he posted on LinkedIn that, \u201cWith its proximity to Grace Cathedral, Huntington Park, and the Financial District, 1330 Jones exemplifies the enduring desirability of Nob Hill real estate.\u201d\nThe sellers were the descendants of the developer, Theo G. Meyer and Sons, which built the seven-story building, according to the deed and probate records. The buyer was Otrera Real Estate, LLC, a Delaware-created entity that lists its address as a P.O. Box at the Rincon Finance Center in downtown San Francisco, according to the deed. The buyers\u2019 agent is unknown.\nThe six-story building at 1330 Jones has 18 one-bedroom, one-bath units, six two-bedroom, one-bath units, and 12 two-bedroom, two-bath units, as well as 23 dedicated parking spots and onsite laundry.\nThe building was first listed as part of a\nthree-building portfolio\nthat was all developed by the Meyer family and came to market at an undisclosed price last summer. It is the smallest building of the three, and the only one to sell thus far. The other two buildings are a 62-unit, 13-story building at 1000 Green Street in Russian Hill and the 56-unit, 13-story Crest Royal at 1310 Jones, which is next door to the building that sold.\nAt least two other San Francisco apartment buildings asking over $10 million are also in contract but are still pending. Magnolia Place, which has 27 apartment units at 3322 Buchanan in the Marina, came to market at the end of September with an asking price of $18 million. The 2001-built non-rent-controlled building with two commercial units fronting Lombard Street has been pending as of Nov. 22, according to Redfin.\u00a0At 1745 Market, a property with 48 apartment units and eight commercial spaces, including local favorite piano bar Martuni\u2019s, went into contract on Jan. 27, according to Redfin. It is owned by\nMosser Properties\nand has been\non and off the market for the last few years\n, with a starting price of $25 million in 2022. It came back to market most recently last September, with an asking price of $14 million. That ask dropped to $13 million in November, just $1 million more than Mosser paid for it back in 2017.\n",

The two-phase project will replace former county probation offices.\nIt also may be first of its kind to use S-13 to streamline approvals and shorten development, according to the Business Times.\nThe S-13 zone allows 100 percent affordable housing projects to bypass environmental and discretionary review, while allowing an additional bonus height, if they meet certain objectives.\nWhile it can help developers get projects approved a year sooner than state streamlining laws like Senate Bill 35 and Assembly Bill 2011, it\u2019s three years faster than a traditional planning application.\nThe three buildings are part of a larger plan to remake Jack London Square with hundreds of affordable homes around a plaza containing a playground, public art and seating.\n\nThe developers plan to spend the next two years raising money to build the project, likely from Measure U Affordable Housing Infrastructure Bond funds, local funding and state financing in tax credits and bonds, according to the Business Times.\nA cost and timeline for the development were not disclosed.\nA later phase, also by Related and East Bay Asian Local Development, would add two affordable apartment buildings and a market-rate complex at 401 Broadway. A rendering suggests two seven- or eight-story buildings and a 20-story tower overlooking I-880.\nRelated California, founded in 1989, is a unit of New York-based Related Companies. The California subsidiary has developed 20,700 apartments, and owns and manages more than 13,000 affordable and workforce housing units across the Golden State, according to its website.\nEast Bay Asian Local Development, founded in 1975 by a group of Asian Pacific Islander college students and young professionals, owns and manages more than 35 residential and commercial developments, according to its website.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

That works out to $176,000 per unit.\nSunrise Realty Trust, an affiliate of TCG Real Estate, is providing $46.5 million of the loan; the rest was syndicated to an affiliate on the TCG Real Estate platform, the release said.\nThe Class A property, at 1207 North Zang Boulevard, is located across the street from Methodist Dallas Medical Center and was built on the site of El Fenix restaurant. It features a rooftop pool and a remote work lounge with private meeting rooms.\nSan Antonio-based developer Kairoi is known for its upscale apartments.

        "content": "The future of Dallas\u2019 iconic \u201cMushroom House\u201d is uncertain after car dealer Clay Cooley acquired the home along with two adjacent Highland Park properties, sparking speculation about potential teardowns.\nThe house at 4200 Armstrong Parkway, known for its curved design and green-blue copper roof, is one of three multimillion-dollar mansions Cooley and his wife, Lisa, own at Armstrong Parkway and Bordeaux Avenue, The Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. The other two are at 4208 Armstrong Parkway and 4209 Bordeaux Avenue.\nThe couple\u2019s plans for their 2.5 acres of prime properties are a mystery. They haven\u2019t commented, but it\u2019s led to questions about whether the unique home, and the historic residences next to it, will survive or be cleared to make way for new construction.\nThe Cooleys haven\u2019t filed any demolition or major renovation permits, though plumbing and mechanical permits were submitted for two of the properties. Preservationists are hopeful that at least the 1920s Tudor-style home on Bordeaux, designed by famed architect Hal Thomson, will be spared.\nThe group Preservation Park Cities recently toured two of the homes but wasn\u2019t allowed inside 4208 Armstrong Parkway due to structural concerns.\nClay Cooley attended a Preservation Park Cities meeting in February, where he expressed a desire to avoid community conflict. Preservationists suggested a design that would retain the Bordeaux home as a guesthouse while allowing for a new build on the Armstrong lots.\n\nThe couple bought the home at 4208 Armstrong Parkway first, in 2020, county records show. They then purchased 4209 Bordeaux Avenue and the Mushroom House in a five-month period, transferring them into their name by December 2024.\nThe Mushroom House, completed in 1997 by Dallas architect Tom Workman, has long divided opinion for its whimsical, storybook-like design. Its price history is unavailable, but its market value is estimated at over $7.5 million, according to Zillow.\nPreservationists admit that while the house is architecturally significant, it may be less defensible due to its modern construction and location on a highly visible lot.\nLocal ordinances also complicate the equation. Highland Park rules prohibit combining all three parcels into a single lot, which could influence Cooley\u2019s final decision.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

Although a groundbreaking ceremony was held last year, the convention center design hasn\u2019t been finalized; plans for the facility have shifted multiple times.\nConcerns about the train project compelled Dallas City Council to back an alternative route for the train last summer; officials said they\u2019d revisit the issue after reviewing the economic impact of various high-speed routes.\nHunt is also the developer behind NorthEnd, a $5 billion mixed-use development that will include a\n$500 million campus\nfor Goldman Sachs.\n\u2013Jess Hardin\n",

The asking price pencils out to $1,860 per square feet.\nA separate listing includes 4705 Island Cove, 4709 Island Cove and 4400 Island Avenue for $25.5 million, combining 4.85 acres and approximately 450 feet of Lake Austin frontage.\nEric Moreland of Moreland Properties has the listing; the identity of the seller, who owns all three properties, is hidden by a trust.\nForty-eight listings over $2 million were added to Austin\u2019s inventory last week, 12 more than it added\nthe week prior\n, according to the Eklund Gomes luxury report.\n\nContracts on luxury homes dipped, from 12 the week before to six last week, five single-family homes and one $2.24 million condo. Purchases typically slow when the annual 9-day SXSW festival and conference takes over the city, Eklund Gomes\u2019 Michael Reisor said.\nThe top contract was for a 5,800-square-foot home last listed for $5.3 million at 4900 Amarra Drive in Barton Creek. It has five bedrooms and a detached guesthouse. It asked $900 per square foot and was listed by Eric Moreland.\nThe other four single-family homes ranged in listed price from $2.5 to $3.25 million, with three in Tarrytown and one near Bee Cave, in the Bella Montagna neighborhood.\nThe condo deal went down for a penthouse asking about $900 per square foot at 901 West 9th Street, unit 704, at the Nokonah residences. The nearly 2,500-square-foot unit has 2 bedrooms, a balcony and an 800-bottle wine cellar.\nThe Nokonah was developed by Robert Barnstone and Perry Lorenz in 2001.

The 1.93-acre property has been owned by the Halperin family for the past 19 years.\nThe development would feature 310 residential units covering about 40 percent of the site, while the remainder will focus on open space, pedestrian-friendly amenities and two or three restaurants, some spanning multiple levels with roof terraces. GFF Design is attached to the project.\nTenants of the strip mall include Open Sesame Lebanese Grill, whose owners have been in discussions with Halperin about remaining in the neighborhood, though whether it stays on-site or relocates is still undecided.\n\nThe project\u2019s design takes a cue from the Old Parkland campus redevelopment by Crow Holdings at 3819 Maple Avenue, which GFF CEO Evan Beattie called \u201ctransformational\u201d for the neighborhood.\nThe redevelopment requires rezoning, which could take up to two years to finalize.\nThe project is set to add to the wave of redevelopment reshaping Oak Lawn, a neighborhood known for its nightlife and identity as the heart of Dallas\u2019 LGBTQ+ community.\nSeveral office and residential developments are underway nearby, like McCourt Partners and HN Capital Partners\u2019 40-acre mixed-use development at\n1650 Oak Lawn Avenue\nas well as\nThe Oak Lawn Design Plaza\n, covering nine acres at 1444 Oak Lawn Avenue from Charlotte, North Carolina\u2013based investor Asana Partners.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

But earlier this month, Dallas officials resolved that problem by securing the deed for the disputed portion of the property.\nThe company, however, has held firm, stating the\ndecision to close is \u201cfinal\u201d\nand that the situation is \u201cfar more complicated than what the public is being led to believe.\u201d Saks has also said its attempts to meet with city officials have been rejected.\n\nIt remains uncertain whether the city\u2019s proposed deal is enough to prompt reconsideration, or even a temporary extension of operations. Tolbert\u2019s letter asked for a response to \u201cthe collective group,\u201d and said Neiman Marcus would have time to \u201ccapture the opportunity we wish to discuss\u201d if the company keeps the store open for a few months longer.\nAlong with the store, Neiman Marcus also plans to vacate its 82,000-square-foot headquarters in NexPoint\u2019s 42-story Cityplace Tower at 2711 North Haskell Avenue.\nThe looming closure threatens to leave a major gap in the city\u2019s downtown retail landscape and in the historic character of Dallas. Neiman Marcus has operated its flagship store for more than a century, serving as an anchor for the district\u2019s identity and economic activity.\nThe consortium is holding out hope of avoiding the significant loss to the city\u2019s downtown core, while Saks is investing $100 million into its Neiman Marcus store at NorthPark Center.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

Twelve Republican lawmakers who replaced pro-gambling politicians in the last election are holding the line against casinos, the Texas Tribune\nreported\n. They are joined by three others who voted in favor of sports betting last session but have since rescinded their support.\nThey said this week they would oppose \u201cany attempt to expand gambling\u201d this session, which ends in May. After that, the Texas Legislature won\u2019t meet in regular session again until 2027.\nProposals to legalize casinos and sports betting have been introduced, but the GOP coalition aims to stop them in their tracks. Neither proposal has received a committee hearing, the first step to consideration by the full house.\nThat could be bad news for the city of Irving, where Sands is seeking zoning approval for a Mavericks stadium with a resort and entertainment center, including a casino. Sands is spending big on lobbying and advertising campaigns in favor of \u201cdestination resort\u201d casinos. If a casino is a no-go, Sands has said it is\nlikely to kill the entire proposal\n.\nMeanwhile in Southern Dallas, developer\nHoque Global\nmet its first deadline in its agreement with the city of Dallas for its University Hills megadevelopment.

The lease brings the building, at 845 Texas Avenue to 99 percent leased.\nAnother law firm, Hicks Johson, is spending $4.3 million to build out its lease at\nSkanska\u2019s\nNorton Rose Fullbright tower at 1550 Lamar Street, which is\ndowntown Houston\u2019s newest\noffice building.\nAnd a retail merchandiser is\nmoving its headquarters\nto 5801 Headquarters Drive in Plano, owned by\nMonarch Alternative Capital\nand\nTourmaline Capital Partners\nand built in 2021. The company will exit Granite Properties\u2019 Granite Park III, which was built in 2007.\nAnd in Austin, Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms is spending $3.7 million on an\noffice buildout in downtown Austin\n, although it\u2019s not clear for whom.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

Horton, holds 3,490 acres. As Houston\u2019s most active homebuilder in 2023, it led the region with 5,570 home starts and continues expanding in suburban communities.\nMeanwhile, Colony Ridge controls nearly 15,000 acres, primarily in Liberty County. The firm, known for developing infrastructure-ready lots, remains a major driver of suburban sprawl despite facing\nscrutiny over its business practices\n.\n\nPublic entities are also prominent landholders. The City of Houston manages 31,530 acres, including major public assets like George Bush Intercontinental Airport, parklands and municipal facilities. The Harris County Flood Control District controls 26,000 acres for its role in flood mitigation efforts.\nThe role of public entities in flood mitigation is particularly crucial, the Bayou City\u2019s low-lying topography and history of major flooding events making infrastructure and water management far more important to long-term development planning relative to most other Texas metros.\nHarris County itself holds 30,130 acres, spanning government buildings, recreational spaces and major event venues like NRG Park.\nHouston\u2019s sprawl is driven by a mix of public investment and private development, with much of the metro\u2019s expansion occurring along major growth corridors like Interstate 45, U.S. Highway 59 and the Grand Parkway.\nLiberty County, where Colony Ridge dominates, is one of the fastest-growing exurban areas, driven by demand for affordable housing. Its population increased 25.5 percent from mid-2020 to last summer, Census data shows.\nMeanwhile, Fort Bend and Montgomery counties continue to attract large-scale master-planned communities, fueled by population growth and proximity to Houston\u2019s employment centers.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

The development is near Fort Worth\u2019s Cultural District, just off Interstate 30.\nThe antique mall has been a fixture in the district for more than 30 years, drawing loyal patrons and housing the Secret Garden restaurant. News of the redevelopment sparked social media backlash, with some residents calling it a \u201cterrible decision\u201d that could displace locals and worsen traffic. No one spoke in opposition at the council\u2019s zoning hearing, despite online pushback.\nCouncil member Macy Hill noted that developers met with local stakeholders prior to the meeting and expressed optimism about the project\u2019s potential to modernize the area.\n\nMontgomery Street Antique Mall\u2019s owners have yet to announce whether the business will relocate or close.\nPhoenix is also working with the Texas Department of Transportation to address concerns about traffic flow and access at the nearby intersection of Montgomery Street and I-30.\nThe project is part of the redevelopment trend across Fort Worth.

Monarch Alternative Capital and Tourmaline Capital Partners purchased the property in 2021.\n\nIt includes features like a game lounge that includes a golf simulator.

Meanwhile, operators of older inventory are under pressure to compete with new deliveries.\nThat\u2019s just one segment of the Dallas-Fort Worth office market, which had 52.8 million square feet of unused office space in November. The Metroplex ranked third in the country for office vacancy, behind New York and Chicago.\n",

He joined Crescent in 2006 when it operated as Goff Capital Partners before its conversion to Crescent Real Estate in 2016.\nThe firm has also promoted several internal leaders. These include Christopher Goff \u2014 Chairman John Goff\u2019s son \u2014 to senior managing director, head of capital formation; Andrew Lombardi, who will remain CFO, to senior managing director; Noelle Garsek to managing director, general counsel; and Ben Molk to managing director, office. Joseph Pitchford, managing director of development, will join Crescent\u2019s senior management committee.\nThe leadership shift comes as Crescent expands its footprint across North Texas. The firm manages $4.4 billion in assets and oversees about $225 million in development.\n\nCrescent is raising $250 million for its fourth GP Invitation Fund as it strengthens its development pipeline. The firm\u2019s portfolio includes marquee assets like The Crescent in Uptown Dallas \u2014 a 1.3 million-square-foot property with office, retail and hotel components \u2014 and the Robert L. Crandall corporate campus for American Airlines in Fort Worth.\nIts development activity is also expanding. Crescent is advancing a\nsecond office tower in Fort Worth\n, constructing the 30-story, 215-unit\nCrescent Point Tower\nin Uptown Dallas and preparing to open a 31-story\nluxury apartment building\nat 2811 Maple in May, where rents start at $4,000 a month.\nIt recently started development on its 92-home\nhigh-end housing project in Horseshoe Bay\nnear Marble Falls, northwest of Austin. Groundwork and infrastructure at the 114-acre site is expected to be completed in March 2026.\nSuszynski said the company is deepening its focus on high-quality development, particularly in Uptown Dallas and Fort Worth, where Crescent is looking to cultivate environments that mirror the success of its flagship properties.\nThe leadership team has an average tenure of over 12 years, Suszynski said.\n",

        "content": "UPDATE: Irving\u2019s Zoning Commission narrowly approved two zoning requests that would pave the way for Las Vegas Sands to build a casino on land the company owns in Irving.\nLas Vegas Sands\u2019 vision for a destination resort in Irving is facing growing public resistance, with concerns over the proposed casino dominating recent discussions.\nMore than 30 Irving residents spoke against the proposal, criticizing the casino element and raising concerns about the city\u2019s planning process in a Planning and Zoning Commission meeting last week, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe commission is\nconsidering a proposal\nto rezone the 182-acre site owned by Sands to allow for high-density, mixed-use development. Sands acquired 259 acres near the former Texas Stadium in mid-2023.\nThe changes would pave the way for a destination resort featuring a potential casino \u2014 pending state legalization \u2014 as well as a 15,000-seat arena for the Dallas Mavericks, plus a hotel, retail and entertainment spaces.\nThe debate comes amid broader speculation about the future of the Dallas Mavericks, co-owned by Sands\u2019\nnewly promoted CEO Patrick Dumont\n. Sands bought Mark Cuban\u2019s majority stake in the Mavericks for $3.5 billion at the end of 2023.\n\nThe rezoning would also establish a baseline development framework, though Sands would need to submit detailed plans for approval later. The proposal is still moving through the early stages. The commission scheduled to revisit it on Monday before a possible city council vote next Thursday.\nResidents argued that discussions were being rushed and lacked transparency, with some claiming they first learned of the zoning amendments just 48 hours before the meeting. Others questioned why city leaders would consider approving zoning for a casino while gambling is illegal in Texas.\nSands has said that a casino is essential for the project\u2019s financial viability. Casino revenue is necessary to support other resort amenities like convention space and entertainment venues, the company said.\nThe company plans to have representatives at the upcoming meetings and maintained Sands is committed to \u201congoing engagement and collaboration,\u201d spokesman Ron Reese said.\nRemoving casino gaming from the zoning could force Sands to reconsider the development altogether, he said.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

The lease will begin in April 2026, but the terms weren\u2019t otherwise disclosed.\nThe deal leaves just 18,000 square feet available in the 47-story, 1.2 million-square-foot tower, which is co-owned by Houston-based Hines and Ivanhoe Cambridge. Savills\u2019 Mark O\u2019Donnell represented the tenant, and Michael Anderson of Cushman &amp; Wakefield represented the landlords.\nThe lease follows Hines\u2019\nlanding a rare $450 million refinancing\nearlier this month, marking the first time in two years a multi-tenant office tower outside New York City was financed through the CMBS single-asset, single-borrower market.\nSkadden will move from its 24,000-square-foot space at 1000 Louisiana Street, Wells Fargo Plaza.\nThat 71-story tower was built in 1983. Its owner, MetLife, plans to spend $138,000 to remodel its 900-square-foot\namenity space\nfor an arcade game room to lure tenants after adding a golf simulator last year. It is also adding a restaurant, bar and tenant lounge, according to the building\u2019s website.\nTexas Tower opened in 2021 and is among the city\u2019s most leased Class A office towers. Other tenants, with Hines\u2019 global headquarters, include law firms Vinson &amp; Elkins, Clifford Chance and DLA Piper as well as Cheniere Energy, Morgan Stanley and coworking space The Square.\n\nThe tower includes two restaurants managed by Berg Hospitality Group. The Sylvie, a French bistro, opened last year. Seafood restaurant Dune Road was set to open last year but hasn\u2019t yet delivered.\nIt also features amenities like underfloor air conditioning, private terraces and a 9,600-square-foot amenity center with a lounge and conference space.\nThe tower\u2019s leasing success highlights the \u201cflight-to-quality\u201d trend, Hines senior managing director John Mooz said.\nClass A inventory has tightened in the city as tenants opt to lease where amenities are enticing enough to lure and retain workers. Older buildings have suffered as a result. The office vacancy rate remains high; it was up to 25.7 percent in the fourth quarter, according to CoStar.\nHouston\u2019s office pipeline has 1.9 million square feet of space under development, about tied with Los Angeles as of January, according to data from CommercialEdge cited by\nCommercialCafe\n. Dallas has 2.8 million square feet underway, and Austin has 3.6 million, the second-most in the nation behind Boston.\nThe drop in office output from previous years across southern markets will likely have a positive effect on occupancy rates, especially as more employers initiate return-to-office mandates, the site said.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "The owner of a Nolita property once slated for development by\nBrandon Miller\u2019s\nReal Estate Equities Corporation is suing the developer and its principals for abandoning the ill-fated office project.\nAri Zagdanski\u2019s Kinsmen Property Group\nclaims Real Estate Equities, or REEC, owes more than $2.9 million in ground rent at 156-166 Bowery Street, according to a new lawsuit filed in state Supreme Court. Kinsmen is suing REEC, principal Mark Seigel and Brandon Miller\u2019s widow Candice, who\u2019s the\nadministrator of his estate\n.\nThe landlord claims that REEC owes more than $5.3 million in back rent, demolition costs, tax reimbursements and outstanding liens on the property.\nREEC took over the leasehold for the 15,000-square-foot assemblage in February 2021 in a deal valued at $50 million. It agreed to demolish the property within 18 months and complete construction on a six- or seven-story mixed-use office building by February 2026, the suit alleges.\nBut that never happened. Instead, REEC failed to pay the ground rent or made partial payments for several months in 2024, the suit alleges. REEC also bailed on more than $600,000 in real estate taxes, which Kinsmen paid to avoid interest and penalties, the suit alleges. The landlord slapped REEC with a default notice in August, the month after\nMiller died\n.\n\nKinsmen filed permits in October to tear down the vacant, graffiti-covered buildings on the property and spent $1.7 million on demolition and related costs, the suit alleges. The landlord later demanded to be reimbursed by Seigel and Candice Miller, as successor to Brandon, who it says \u201cjointly and severally\u201d guaranteed the construction costs.\nLawyers for Kinsmen and Miller did not immediately respond to comment. Seigel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nBrandon Miller died by suicide on July 3, leaving behind a tangled web of\nunfinished real estate projects\nand delinquent payments. REEC has gone dark since Brandon\u2019s death and the company\u2019s website is now hidden behind a password, raising questions about the future of REEC and its projects.\nThe landlord terminated REEC\u2019s ground lease in January.\nMeanwhile,\ntwo other properties\nonce envisioned by Miller are turning a corner. Leasing has begun at an East Village office property developed by REEC and a vacant lot in Chelsea where Miller once envisioned another office building is up for sale.\n",

        "content": "Stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one before: People in real estate gave Andrew Cuomo money.\nIt has been a while since I\u2019ve written a story about this, but there was a time when it was a regular thing.\nThe latest campaign filings (showing donations between Jan. 12 and March 13) show RXR CEO Scott Rechler, previously a\nconsistent\ndonor to Cuomo when he was governor, gave Fix the City,\na super PAC backing\nCuomo, $250,000. He also donated $2,100 directly to Cuomo\u2019s campaign this month.\nAn entity tied to Lightstone contributed $100,000 to the PAC. Joseph Paolino Jr., former mayor of Rhode Island turned developer, gave $25,000. A&amp;E Real Estate\u2019s Douglas Eisenberg donated $125,000 to the PAC. Anthony Scarmucci\u2019s Skybridge Capital threw the PAC $100,000. Scarmucci and his wife also each gave $2,100 to Cuomo\u2019s campaign.\nTwenty-one people who self-identified as working in real estate gave Cuomo\u2019s campaign the maximum $2,100, or a total of more than $44,000. That group included Cammeby\u2019s Avi Schron, KRE Group\u2019s Jonathan Kushner, Capstone Equities\u2019 Daniel Ghadamian, Ruben Companies\u2019 Andrew and Richard Ruben, Somerset\u2019s Keith Rubenstein, GFP\u2019s Jeff Gural and BFC Partners\u2019 Winthrop Wharton.\nSeveral employees of L+M Development Partners gave to Cuomo, including Ron Moelis ($400), as did employees of Two Trees Management (including founder David and principal Jed Walentas, with the latter having also donated to Whitney Tilson and Zellnor Myrie).\nDonors who indicated that they work in real estate gave more than $73,000 to Cuomo\u2019s campaign. But many real estate folks are sneaky and list their occupation as CEO or chief executive or self-employed, which is a small part of why sifting through campaign donations is a nightmare.\nAmong that group, in addition to Gural and Rechler, I spotted MAG Partners\u2019 MaryAnne Gilmartin, who donated $1,000 and Ashley Cotton (who\npreviously worked for Cuomo\n), who gave $250. Brown Harris Stevens CEO Bess Freedman donated $250, as did Douglaston Development\u2019s Jessica Sherman.\nReal estate donors in the other campaigns are more scattered. Mayor Eric Adams previously could count on donations from heavy hitters in the industry, but many have\nbacked off\ngiving to his campaign since his indictment. His latest filing shows he only brought in a little more than $36,000 between Jan. 12 and March 13, with only a couple donations from smaller real estate players.\nA PAC tied to the Real Estate Board of New York (Taxpayers for an Affordable New York) gave City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams $2,100.\n\u201cAdrienne Adams has advanced a pro-growth agenda as Speaker, most notably in her support for City of Yes,\u201d REBNY President Jim Whelan said in a statement. He noted that the passage of the broker fee bill, known as the FARe Act, was \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d but said she is an \u201cimportant voice to the Mayor\u2019s race.\u201d\nAdams is also remains an influential force in the city, given that even if she loses the primary, she will be the City Council Speaker through the end of the year.\n\nLaszlo Syrop, managing director of acquisitions at the Hudson Companies, donated $175 to Sen. Zellnor Myrie. Moelis also gave Myrie $400.\nA PAC tied to Airbnb has spent more than $400,000 on ads supporting City Council incumbents Kevin Riley, Oswald Feliz, Amanda Farias, Selvena Brooks-Powers and Mercedes Narcisse. The groups is also supporting Tyrell Hankerson\u2019s bid for Adrienne Adams\u2019 Council seat and Rafael Salamanca\u2019s campaign for Bronx Borough President. The incumbents are all sponsors on a bill that would ease stringent short-term rental rules for allow one- and two-family homes, allowing owners to rent out their property for fewer than 30 days, using sites like Airbnb.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat do you make of real estate companies\nrolling back\ntheir diversity, equity and inclusion policies? Do you have any experiences with these programs and policies? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nThere was a time when mortgages were great? Bill Pulte, the new director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency,\nposted \u201cMake Mortgages Great Again\u201d on social media platform X\non Saturday. On Monday, Pulte removed eight members from the Fannie Mae board and six members from the Freddie Mac board.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 The city agreed to pay cab drivers $140 million in back pay to settle a lawsuit filed in 2006,\nGothamist reports\n. A federal court found that the Taxi and Limousine Commission unfairly revoked licenses from thousands of drivers after they were arrested, even though they were never convicted.\n\u2014 The state will pay $8 million to settle a claim brought by Carl Dukes, who spent nearly two decades in prison for a murder he did not commit,\nthe Times Union reports\n. The settlement comes after a state appellate court ruled that Albany detectives had coerced a confession from Dukes, related to the murder of a University at Albany student in 1997. The court found that Dukes was innocent and should be further compensated for the time he spent incarcerated.\n\u2014 Unless a court says otherwise, the city\u2019s congestion pricing program will continue despite the Friday shutdown deadline set by the Federal Highway Administration,\nCBS New York reports\n. MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber said the \u201cdeadline will come and go and the congestion pricing program will continue to deliver much better traffic environment for New York and economic benefits as well.\u201d\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Tuesday was\n$60 million\nfor a 5,840-square-foot condominium at 150 Charles Street in the West Village. Peter Zaitzeff, Jared Freedman and Samantha Germano of\nSerhant had the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$27.5 million\nfor a 9,765-square-foot commercial building at 34 East 61st Street in Lenox Hill. Christian Advocates Serving Evangelism (CASE) sold the property to Kassin Sabbagh Realty.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$29.5 million\nfor a 4,019-square-foot condominium at 432 Park Avenue in Midtown. The Eklund Gomes Team at Douglas Elliman has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 226,342-square-foot, eight-story, 236-unit project at 694 East 142nd Street in North New York. Alen Moghaddam filed the permit on behalf of NYC\u2019s Building &amp; Land Development Services.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

Hu was\nindicted last month\nfor allegedly bribing the chief executive officer of a nonprofit.\nThe Fresh Meadows hotel has housed formerly incarcerated people since 2021 and served as the site for\nmultiple fundraisers\nto support Adams.\nProsecutors say\nHu paid Julio Medina, the head of a taxpayer-funded program for recently released incarcerated people, elaborate kickbacks including the purchase of a $1.3 million townhouse and financing on a luxury vehicle. In exchange, Hu allegedly received more than $20 million in city-funded contracts for two of her hotels, as well as her catering company.\nHu pleaded not guilty to all charges. She is negotiating a plea agreement, according to court filings, though her criminal attorney denies any negotiations.\nCity Comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander is pushing for the Adams administration to cancel a contract extension that would ultimately steer $20 million towards Hu, according to\nThe City\n. The three-year renewal would begin in July.\n\nA spokesperson for the mayor\u2019s office of criminal justice \u2014 the contract holder \u2014 said the administration is looking for an alternative site, but that it could be challenging; a spokesperson for HousingWorks, the nonprofit occupying the space, said no substantive coordination between the organization and city about relocating has happened.\nSecurity firm owner Christopher Dantzler was also charged in what prosecutors labeled an elaborate kickback scheme involving more than $120 million in public funds being steered toward Exodus. Medina ultimately funneled $51 million in public funds to companies belonging to Hu and Dantzler, according to prosecutors.\nHu was released on a $20 million bond with her passport seized, while Medina and Dantzler were released on $250,000 and $750,000 bonds, respectively. All three defendants pleaded not guilty.\nHu has been on the receiving end of positive regulatory decisions from local officials, including approval of construction projects that were either cited for worker safety or affordable housing violations.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The property is also only steps from Lincoln Center.\nThe property faced controversy when Glenwood\nnot only banned dogs\nweighing 15 pounds or more from the building but also required dogs to be carried by their owners into the elevator to avoid doggy paws scuffing up the lobby floors.\nElsewhere in Lincoln Square, the Gotham Organization and the Carlyle Group\nlanded a $216 million bridge loan\na year ago associated with their acquisition of the building at 200 West 67th Street. The loan, provided by MF1 Capital, was brought to market shortly after Gotham and Carlyle purchased The Aire from A&amp;R Kalimian Realty\nfor $265 million\n.\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Bally\u2019s is hedging a bet on its controversial diversity-focused fundraising plan for its $1.7 billion Chicago casino development on the former Tribune newspaper printing plant site in River West.\nBally\u2019s Chicago is now seeking to raise $195 million through a private share sale, as the Securities and Exchange Commission has halted an effort to raise $250 million through an initial public offering exclusively targeted at women and minority investors, the Chicago Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe shift in fundraising methods comes as the company, a subsidiary of Rhode Island-based Bally\u2019s Corp., is navigating significant regulatory challenges for its project, which is set to become the Windy City\u2019s first full-fledged permanent gambling emporium.\nLast summer, Bally\u2019s Chicago garnered attention with plans for a $250 million IPO exclusively targeting qualified female and minority investors. This initiative was prompted by a mandate from the city of Chicago, stipulating that 25 percent of the new casino must be owned by minorities and women. However, the SEC has yet to approve the IPO, citing the need for updated audited financials from Bally\u2019s Chicago.\n\nIn response to the regulatory delay, Bally\u2019s launched a private placement offering, which has already secured over $83 million from 270 accredited investors, the outlet reported, citing the firm\u2019s financial disclosures. This approach is running alongside the stalled public offering and includes individuals who meet the criteria specified by Chicago\u2019s ownership mandate, according to Bally\u2019s spokesperson Richard Land.\nLegal hurdles loom, however. The IPO has faced federal court challenges, with accusations of discrimination leveled by plaintiffs supported by groups like the American Alliance for Equal Rights and the Liberty Justice Center. These lawsuits argue that the IPO unfairly favors minority and female investors, potentially excluding others from participating in the investment opportunity.\nMeanwhile, Bally\u2019s continues to refund deposits to potential IPO investors as it strives to gain SEC clearance. The company remains optimistic about its casino project, which has recently received site plan approval and is slated to open in September 2026. The complex promises a 500-room hotel, entertainment venues, multiple dining options, and public spaces, and aims to redefine Chicago\u2019s hospitality and gaming scene.\n\u2014 Sam Lounsberry\n",

Investigators discovered one signature belonged to a co-owner who died in 2016.\n\nWeeks later, the defendants allegedly filed forged documents transferring a Kew Gardens Hills home from its mother-daughter owners to another one of Ray\u2019s companies. By May, they had sold this property to a third party for $600,000, according to the indictment, and approximately $442,000 was wired to an account linked to Ray.\nThe third party who purchased the property has since filed a civil suit against the legitimate owners, although proceedings have been stayed under legislation enacted in 2023 to\nprotect against deed fraud\n.\nIn May 2023, the group also allegedly targeted an 82-year-old woman\u2019s Jamaica Estates home using similar tactics.\nAll four defendants surrendered to authorities on Wednesday. They are scheduled to return to court on April 29. If convicted, Ray, Valeri and Avinger face up to 25 years in prison, while Guice faces up to 15 years.\n",

Meiner was upset that O Cinema\u2019s leadership went ahead with the screenings after initially acquiescing to his demand not to show the film, directed by Palestinian activist Basel Adra and Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham.\nLast week, Meiner condemned \u201cNo Other Land\u201d as \u201ca false one-sided propaganda attack on the Jewish people.\u201d\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s meeting, Meiner claimed his reaction was rooted in ensuring public safety for the city\u2019s Jewish constituents amid rising anti-Semitism across the globe because of Israel\u2019s ongoing destruction of Palestine since Hamas terrorists killed more than 1,400 Israelis and kidnapped 240 more on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\u201cThroughout history, there\u2019s been different excuses for hating Jews,\u201d Meiner said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s because Jews are too successful, sometimes because they\u2019re too poor. Now it\u2019s the state of Israel. It doesn\u2019t matter. Every generation it morphs into something else. It\u2019s just a convenient excuse. And that\u2019s what I was trying to highlight.\u201d\nStill, a majority of speakers during the meeting\u2019s public comments voiced opposition to Meiner\u2019s push to evict O Cinema, calling his actions government censorship.\n\u201cWe saw democracy in action,\u201d O Cinema co-founder Kareem Tabsch told\nThe Real Deal\nfollowing the meeting. \u201cThere was an outpouring of support for O Cinema, and I think Meiner did the right thing. I respect his viewpoint and decisions.\u2026It\u2019s not the government\u2019s role to dictate what art organizations should be showing or not showing.\u201d\nA majority of the city commission concurred with Tabsch\u2019s view. \u201cThe First Amendment is clear,\u201d commissioner Fernandez said during the meeting. \u201cThe government must never censor artistic expression even when it is controversial or deeply offensive.\u201d\nVice-Mayor Bhatt noted that O Cinema has shown more than 50 pro-Israel films by Jewish filmmakers, hosts the Miami Jewish Film Festival and screened a 12-hour documentary about the Holocaust. \u201cTo silence that voice does more damage than almost anything I can think of,\u201d Bhatt said. \u201cI will tell you that I\u2019m not censoring anybody.\u201d",

        "content": "Journey Capital scooped up a 404-unit multifamily complex in Plantation for $102 million.\nThe New York-based investment manager bought Rise at Plantation Walk at 333 North University Drive from Boca Raton-based Encore Capital Management, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The deal breaks down to $252,500 per unit.\nJourney borrowed $89.7 million from Houston-based Corebridge Financial.\nRise at Plantation Walk consists of a pair of seven-story buildings completed in 2021 and 2022 on a roughly 2.3-acre site, property records show. It offers studios and one- to three-bedroom apartments, with monthly rents ranging from $2,172 to $4,415, according to Apartments.com.\nThe complex is part of Encore Capital\u2019s mixed-use\nPlantation Walk\nproject on a 32-acre site that used to be Fashion Mall.\nEncore, led by\nArt Falcone\n, bought the then-vacant mall in a bankruptcy auction in 2015 for\n$37.7 million\n. In 2019, Plantation city officials\napproved\nthe redevelopment with up to 700 apartments, about 250,000 square feet of offices and 225,000 square feet of retail.\n\nEncore has sold completed portions of Plantation Walk over the years. In 2021, it sold the seven-story, 177,000-square-foot office building at 261 North University Drive to Vision Properties for\n$57.5 million\n.\nJourney Capital hasn\u2019t been a high-profile player in South Florida\u2019s market. The firm, founded in 2023, buys, develops and manages multifamily, industrial and mixed-use properties across the U.S., according to its website. It\u2019s led by CEO Peter Calatozzo.\nPreviously, Calatozzo was with Praedium Group, his LinkedIn shows.\nSouth Florida\u2019s\nmultifamily\ninvestment sales market has experienced an uptick during recent months after a slowdown over the past two years. Sales volume was $4.3 billion last year and $3.4 billion in 2023, down from $9.2 billion in 2022 and $15.4 billion in 2021, according to data from Avison Young. In 2021 and 2022, South Florida became a magnet for out-of-state residents, fueling\nunprecedented\ndemand from tenants and\nrecord\nrent hikes, but in the later years the market\nslowed\ndue to elevated interest rates and\nhefty new supply\n, which tempered tenant demand.\nLast month, FCP paid\n$90 million\nfor the 400-unit Arium Sunrise complex at 1501 Northwest 124th Terrace in Sunrise. That came on the heels of TA Realty buying the 300-unit Bell Pembroke Pines complex at 16700 Sheridan Street in Pembroke Pines for\n$118 million\n.",

        "content": "Douglas Elliman is celebrating its top-producing agents in New York City, who rose among the ranks of the firm as it waded through a turbulent 2024.\nThe brokerage on Wednesday announced the winners of its annual Ellie awards, recognizing brokers who earned the largest sales volumes and gross commission incomes, and closed the highest number of transactions last year.\nElliman\u2019s agents \u201cdidn\u2019t just have an outstanding 2024; they defined it,\u201d Richard Ferrari, the head of the company\u2019s brokerage, wrote in a statement. CEO Michael Liebowitz pointed to \u201ctheir expertise, entrepreneurial drive, and commitment to excellence\u201d\nAgents and teams with operations in the Big Apple racked up company-wide accolades this year, including the Eklund-Gomes Team, which once again snagged the Billion Dollar Club Award for exceeding $1 billion in sales. The cohort, led by Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes, also nabbed the highest GCI among the firm\u2019s mega teams, followed by Noble Black &amp; Partners.\nIn Manhattan, Ann Cutbill Lenane was named the top agent by sales volume, transactions and GCI,\nadding a third honor\nto her spoils from the year prior. Lenane \u2014 who placed 26th in\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nlatest ranking\nof the city\u2019s top agents with $76 million in sell-side deals \u2014 was also the No. 4 agent by GCI for the entire company.\nFollowing Lenane in sales volume and GCI was Michelle Griffith, who led sales at the Reuben Brothers\u2019 Upper East Side hotel-condo conversion, alongside top broker Lauren Muss. The project, known as the Surrey, was a fixture atop\nweekly contract reports\nin the borough, scoring signed contracts for at least three units priced north of $20 million.\n\nThe Michael Lorber Team finished first in sales, transactions and commission income among Elliman\u2019s large teams in New York City. The group slid into the top spot after the 2024 winner, the Holly Parker Team,\njumped from Elliman\nto Compass earlier this year amid a\nwave of brokers\nexiting the firm over the last few months.\nLorber\u2019s team, which placed 11th in\nTRD\u2019s\nrankings with $103 million in sales, was also the third top-earning large team overall.\nAlso among the top teams highlighted in the awards was the Rubin Team, which was No. 1 in GCI and transactions among the firm\u2019s medium teams in Manhattan. The Lindsay Barton Barrett Team earned the most commission income, sales volume and transactions among the company\u2019s small teams.\nIn Brooklyn, the top-selling individual agent was Rebekah Carver, and the top-selling medium and small teams were the Scott Robles Team and The Bartolucci Team, respectively.\nElliman tapped its honorees following an end to the year rife with executive turnover. The firm\u2019s longtime CEO and chairman Howard Lorber abruptly retired in October under pressure from the board.\nThe head of the company\u2019s brokerage, Scott Durkin, was terminated just days after Lorber stepped down from his post. Chief operations officer Richard Lampen also exited the firm at the end of last year.\nElliman, Manhattan\u2019s third-largest brokerage by\nTRD\u2019s analysis\nof sales volume, closed 2024 with a\n$76 million loss\n, up from the $43 million lost the previous year. The brokerage has been in the red for more than two years, though it pushed its revenue above $1 billion last year.\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s real estate industry is pushing back against the anti-gentrification ordinance that took effect this month, with one group launching a letter-writing campaign against it.\nLandlords and brokers are frustrated with the right of first refusal granted to tenants in some Northwest Side neighborhoods, which allows tenants to band together to purchase their buildings ahead of any outside investor.\nThe Chicagoland Apartment Association and the Neighborhood Building Owner\u2019s Alliance said the right of first refusal will delay the sale of buildings, causing problems for owners who may need to sell quickly, and could have a cooling effect on investment in the area.\n\u201cThis ordinance punishes owners of affordable housing, devalues their property, and makes it harder to invest in neighborhood housing,\u201d said Mike Glasser, president of the Neighborhood Building Owner\u2019s Alliance, which launched a letter-writing campaign against the ordinance.\nGlasser\u2019s organization, an alliance of 11 landlord associations, put up a webpage with forms for contacting alderpeople, along with information about the ordinance.\nIt\u2019s also asking members to share personal stories of how the ordinance affected them if they are owners in the area. In addition to legislative tactics, the group is exploring ways to challenge the ordinance in court, according to comments made in an October conference call.\nThey are looking for examples of sellers being harmed by the requirement to give renters in larger buildings a 60-day notice of intent to sell and another 90 days to form a tenant association to decide if they want to buy the building. This timeline is shorter for buildings of four units or fewer, where the total timeline is 45 days.\nThe ordinance was crafted to address documented displacement and gentrification faced by residents in the communities covered by the ordinance, said Kelvin Gensollen Arellano, housing organizer with a community group called Palenque LSNA. The industry\u2019s arguments, on the other hand, are \u201chypothetical,\u201d he said.\nThe ordinance is a pilot program that will sunset at the end of 2029 unless renewed. The program applies to parts of Logan Square, Avondale, Hermosa, Humboldt Park and West Town as well as Pilsen. It is meant to stem exploding housing costs in areas that began gentrifying rapidly about 10 years ago, when developers started tearing down two- and three-flats and replacing them with luxury homes along the 606 trail. The area lost 6.1 percent of its two- to six-flat buildings between 2013 and 2018, according to the DePaul Institute for Housing Studies.\nIn response to the loss of smaller multifamily buildings, the ordinance also allows for the construction of two-flats by right in any areas within the ordinance\u2019s boundaries that are zoned for single-family. Finally, the measure increased demolition surcharges from $5,000 per unit or $15,000 per building to $20,000 per unit and $60,000 per building, whichever is higher.\n\u2018Unintended consequences\u2019 and \u2018trojan horse\u2019 arguments\nAndy Friedman, a multifamily broker with Kiser Group, said owners and developers will just find ways around portions of the ordinance designed to preserve existing affordable housing and protect against displacement, bringing \u201cunintended consequences\u201d to tenants and sellers.\nFor example, sellers will likely move to vacate buildings before selling as a way of skirting tenant rights, meaning less available housing in the area for that period of time, Friedman said.\nThe ordinance prohibits owners from displacing tenants after purchasing a building, requiring them to keep inherited tenants for 6 months or until the end of their lease, whichever is longer. That could pose a challenge for buyers looking to rehab a property and sellers may want to avoid the elongated timeline of granting tenants the right to first refusal. Vacating a property before bringing it to market may become a more attractive option, said Compass broker Mario Greco.\n\nThe increased demolition fees may hurt owners and sale prices in the area as buyers will take that cost off the top of any offers they make, Friedman said. Though he has not seen evidence of a drop in investment or average sale price yet, Friedman said the ordinance has \u201cdefinitely changed the attitude\u201d of developers toward the area.\nWith so much of the area\u2019s affordable housing already bought up by outside investors, Gensollen Arellano said most of the money from multifamily sales was not circulating or being reinvested in\u00a0 local communities anyway. Revenue from the surcharges will go to the Chicago Community Land Trust to support the \u201cconstruction, rehabilitation or preservation of affordable housing\u201d in the area, according to the ordinance. Developers who plan to reserve at least half of proposed units for families who earn up to 60 percent of the area\u2019s median income are exempt from the increased surcharges.\nThe Chicago City Council\namended the ordinance\nin response to concerns from the industry in December, adding the sunset date, delaying implementation of the right to first refusal until March 1 and requiring tenants to provide proof of financial backing to move forward in purchasing a building. The Chicagoland Apartment Association supported these amendments, but it would prefer for the council to overturn the measure altogether, said the organization\u2019s executive vice president Mike Mini. It\u2019s unlikely there is any political will to do so given strong support for the ordinance among aldermen, he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m certain that the evidence is going to show that this is not an effective ordinance, and perhaps then there\u2019ll be an opportunity to revisit this,\u201d Mini said. \u201cIf there\u2019s an opportunity to overturn it, we certainly would participate in that.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Palenque LSNA, which\nworked to get the ordinance passed last fall\n, has launched an education campaign of its own, canvassing Northwest Side neighborhoods to inform tenants about their rights.\n\u201cThis is the first step,\u201d Gensollen Arellano said. The second step has been talking with tenants about the kinds of \u201clegal, logistical and financial support\u201d they might need in order to execute their rights, so that Palenque and others can help bridge that gap, he said.\nBrokers who work in the area said they have yet to see an example of tenants organizing to match an offer from a third-party buyer to purchase their building, and Mini said he doubts the likelihood of it happening, particularly in larger buildings.\nThe timeline afforded to tenants to organize represents an unnecessary delay that will disadvantage small, live-in owners who may have more logistical and timing constraints around buying a property if they are taking out a mortgage, said NBOA member Joe Wilcox, a property manager and broker.\nThe ordinance states that 75 percent of occupied units should be in agreement in order for tenants to move forward with buying their building. That\u2019s more of a challenge in larger buildings, but Palenque LSNA is working to provide support to tenants on a case-by-case basis. Tenants can also opt to transfer their right of first refusal to a third-party organization that is committed to keeping the building affordable, Gensollen Arellano said.\nIndustry players\u2019 arguments that reforms will end up hurting renters or local, small-time landlords are often a \u201ctrojan horse\u201d for less community-minded concerns, he said.\n\u201cMost of the people who are purchasing these two-flats and three-flats are not families. Most of them are very big companies that are trying to resell them at a very big price and de-converting these units into luxury homes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a rational period of time to ask people to wait 30 days. It\u2019s not like the entire world will end during this period of time.\u201d\nBut Mini and others in the industry maintained that if the city really wanted to protect affordable housing in the area, they would remove restrictions on sellers, open up zoning and make it easier to increase the overall supply of housing.\n\u201cThe ordinances in the city of Chicago are such that it makes it very, very difficult to operate a rental property, and that puts upward pressure on rents. Costs are skyrocketing. Insurance is going up. Property taxes are high. Utility charges are high. It\u2019s difficult to get financing,\u201d Mini said. \u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of headwinds in the apartment industry right now, and until we change our policies to make it easier to build and maintain properties, we\u2019re going to continue to have this problem.\u201d\n",

It relies on Presidio profits and private donations,\nnot taxpayer money\n, according to a Trust report.\nThe White House didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment by the Standard.\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for President Trump to do what the state of California has failed to do,\u201d Charlene Nijmeh, chair of the tribe, said in a statement. \u201cNot only will returning the Presidio to Indigenous care be the right thing for our people and for the land, but it will also save the federal government \u2014 and taxpayers \u2014 money.\u201d\nThe tribe, working with the Lakota People\u2019s Law Project, has launched a\npetition\nseeking public support for the initiative.\n\nTribal officials said they submitted a right of first refusal to the federal government during the decommissioning of the military base in 1992, but faced opposition from prominent California politicians, including the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, both Democrats.\nIn the petition addressed to Trump and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe called the Presidio \u201ca beautiful national park on the tribe\u2019s traditional homelands in San Francisco.\u201d\nIt said the goal of the petition is to \u201crematriate\u201d the Presidio and \u201cestablish a new reservation\u201d there.\n\u201cRematriation,\u201d according to the Sogorea Te\u2019 Land Trust, is \u201cIndigenous woman-led work to restore sacred relationships between Indigenous people\u201d and \u201cancestral land.\u201d\nThe tribe said the \u201crightful return\u201d of the Presidio would be \u201can extraordinary act of reconciliation\u201d and that the Muwekma people maintain a \u201cdeep cultural and spiritual connection to the Presidio lands.\u201d\nThe Muwekma Ohlone Tribe claims on its\nwebsite\nthat it was once federally recognized as the Verona Band of Alameda County but was omitted from the Bureau of Indian Affairs\u2019 first official list of recognized tribes, drafted in 1978, according to the Standard.\nThe tribe has sought to reaffirm its federal status for more than 45 years. There are 614 members of the tribe, living mostly across the Bay Area, an unidentified spokesperson told the newspaper.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Construction is planned in six phases over 11 years, with work on the first phase beginning in June. A second phase is expected to launch in 2027. Qualico\u2019s business units include Sterling Homes and Pacesetter Homes, and it opened a McKinney office in 2018.\nThe 98-acre Erwin Farms, near North Country Lane and FM 1141, will include 123 lots, hiking and biking trails, and two multi-use sports courts. Prices are estimated to range between $750,000 and $1.2 million, with construction expected to span six years. The first residents could move in by mid-2028.\n\nThe developments underscore Rockwall County\u2019s rapid transformation. The county\u2019s population has increased 4 percent in the past year alone, surpassing 137,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Since 2020, it has grown an estimated 25 percent, making it one of Texas\u2019 fastest-growing counties, second only to neighboring Kaufman County.\nThe Dallas-Fort Worth home building market is experiencing significant growth, driven by strong demand and a robust development pipeline. The region is a leader in construction permits,\ntrailing only Houston\nnationally.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

        "content": "President Donald Trump said he wanted strings attached to billions of dollars in federal aid to\u00a0 Los Angeles County, where firestorms this year torched 16,000 homes and businesses.\nBut Republicans in Congress appear to have cooled on conditioning federal aid to California \u2014 which doesn\u2019t appear on the horizon months after the Jan. 7 fires in Altadena and the Pacific Palisades,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported.\nLast month, Gov. Gavin Newsom requested\n$40 billion\nin disaster funding, but there\u2019s little movement on any aid.\n\u201cCongress must receive the formal disaster aid request from the administration,\u201d a spokesperson for House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, said in a statement to the Chronicle.\nThe White House declined to comment on when it might send Congress the request.\nTwo weeks after the fires, Trump\nthreatened to withhold federal aid\nfor the thousands of Los Angeles-area residents who lost their homes unless the state requires voter identification at the polls and opens the water spigot to Southern California.\nDisaster aid will likely get attention from Congress when lawmakers return from district work periods on March 24, Republicans Rep Ken Calvert from Palm Desert, and Rep. Doug LaMalfa from Chico, told the Chronicle.\nCalvert, the most senior California lawmaker and the only California Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, said he suspects there will need to be more than one vote on disaster aid, including one to provide additional funding to the\nFederal Emergency Management Agency\n.\n\n\u201cAt some point, we\u2019re going to have to put a little more money in FEMA, I think, because obviously the debris removal was extremely expensive,\u201d Calvert told the newspaper.\nMembers of Congress from California, including all nine Republicans, signed onto a\nMarch 7 letter\nurging congressional leadership to provide additional assistance to Los Angeles County.\n\u201cJust as the federal government has come to the aid of communities impacted by wildfires across the western United States, tornados in the Midwest, ice storms in Texas, or hurricanes in the Southeast, we should once again support the recovery of the impacted families, businesses, and communities in Los Angeles County,\u201d the lawmakers said.\nSeveral projections have estimated that insured losses from the January wildfires in L.A. County could reach $30 billion or more, making it the\ncostliest natural disaster in state history\n.\nSeveral California Republicans said they want to see a clearer accounting of existing liabilities to determine how much federal money is needed.\n\u201cFEMA is going through all the numbers and identifying what the costs are, and we\u2019re trying to determine the liability \u2014 who\u2019s liable,\u201d whether it\u2019s Southern California Edison, the insurance companies or other entities, Calvert told the Chronicle.\n\u201cRight now, California is hip-shooting a number. They don\u2019t have what amount is insured versus uninsured,\u201d and whether Southern California Edison will have responsibility for the Eaton Fire, added Republican Rep. Darrell Issa from Escondido. \u201cIf they have primary responsibility, that\u2019s a huge difference in the funding \u2014 literally billions of dollars. So we\u2019re prepared to offer a bill, but to put a number on it we do need these items done.\u201d\nIn January, several Republicans\nfloated the idea\nof making wildfire aid for California contingent on policy changes, an idea that drew a\nharsh rebuke\nfrom Anaheim Republican Rep. Young Kim.\n\u201cPlaying politics with people\u2019s livelihoods is unacceptable and a slap in the face to the Southern California wildfire victims and to our brave first responders,\u201d Kim said in a statement.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew",

It was built in 1901 but was renovated and partially reconstructed in 2010 after part of the building collapsed during a condo conversion.

There are also 18 indoor parking spaces on the property that Altitude will offer up with the condos when they go to market.\nAltitude plans to transform the units with finishes and floor plans designed to appeal to wealthy buyers looking to downsize with a Gold Coast home. The condos are set to hit the market in the middle of next year. Dohmen declined to specify price points for the units.\u00a0The building was previously a 50-room long-term-stay hotel called Dearborn Manor, a name that stuck around until at least the 1950s. Later, it was a 27-unit condo building.\n",

        "content": "A trio of Manhattan office buildings scored 10-figure CMBS deals in February, another sign of a post-pandemic recovery for trophy commercial properties.\nThe blockbuster refinancings come amid an overall surge in issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities. CMBS issuances totaled $18.3 billion nationwide last month, more than double January\u2019s total of $7.9 billion, according to KBRA. That\u2019s up 196 percent year-over-year, and the bond ratings association predicted \u201cno likely slowdown on the horizon.\u201d\nThe CMBS market is often considered a bellwether for the overall lending market and the broader commercial real estate market.\nIrvine Company\u2019s famed\nMetLife Building\nlanded the largest CMBS deal, a $1.5 billion loan issued by Bank of America and Wells Fargo.\nAnd Aby Rosen\u2019s RFR Holding got some good news for a change, scoring a $1.2 billion refinancing of the\nSeagram Building\n.\nIvanho\u00e9 Cambridge\u2019s trophy office tower,\n3 Bryant Park\n, grabbed another massive $1.1 billion CMBS loan.\n\u201cThe volumes have been fantastic,\u201d Trepp\u2019s Stephen Buschbom said of bond issuance on The TreppWire podcast. \u201cI\u2019m looking ahead at what\u2019s scheduled into April and we\u2019re just a stone\u2019s throw from hitting $35 billion.\u201d\nThe Real Deal\nbroke down February\u2019s five largest loans in Manhattan and the top five in the outer boroughs:\nNew life for MetLife | $1.5B | Midtown\nBank of America and Wells Fargo\noriginated a $1.5 billion CMBS loan for the Irvine Company\u2019s famed MetLife Building. The loan carries an interest rate of 6.25 percent over 10 years, a sizable jump from the 3.6 percent interest rate Donald Bren\u2019s firm previously faced. The debt-serving costs will double to approximately $100 million a year. The 58-story, 3 million-square-foot building is 94 percent occupied and generates $170 million in net operating income. Ownership, which included Tishman Speyer until it was bought out last year for an unknown price, has invested $180 million in the property dating back to the year before the pandemic.\nRosen refi | $1.2B | Midtown\nMorgan Stanley, Citi Real Estate Funding and JPMorgan Chase\noriginated a $1.2 billion CMBS loan to refinance RFR Holding\u2019s Seagram Building at 375 Park Avenue. The four-year, fixed-rate loan will carry a 6.25 percent interest rate, nearly double the 3.53 percent rate on the existing debt, according to Morningstar Credit. The refinancing package retires $1.15 billion in existing debt, utilizing $24.6 million from existing reserves to complete the payment. The loan structure will fund significant reserves, including a $26 million escrow for contractual free rent and $21.3 million for outstanding landlord obligations. Newmark recently appraised the 38-story, 860,000-square-foot property at more than $1.8 billion. The trophy office tower boasts a 96 percent occupancy rate.\nBryant Park boon | $1.1B | Midtown\nWells Fargo, Bank of America and Bank of Montreal\nprovided a $1.13 billion CMBS loan for Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge\u2019s trophy office tower, 3 Bryant Park. The loan for the 1.2-million-square-foot tower at 1095 Sixth Avenue \u2014 located between West 41st and 42nd streets \u2014 replaces a CMBS loan\nof the same amount.\nThe fresh financing is an encouraging sign for the Canadian investor, which has\nalmost $5 billion worth of loans\nset to mature in the next year. The real estate arm of Quebec\u2019s $300 billion pension fund tore through U.S. cities over the past decade, paying top dollar to buy top-tier properties.\n\nPark Avenue payday | $500M | Midtown\nCiti Group and JPMorgan\nprovided a $500 million loan to refinance Fisher Brothers\u2019\n299 Park Avenue\n. The fresh financing replaces a $325 million loan from a group of lenders. The landlord recently spent $20 million on a capital improvement project at the 42-story, 1.2 million-square-foot tower, which is 95 percent leased. Capital One and UBS combine to take up 30 percent of the rentable square footage in the building and are in place through 2031. Lease expirations are minimal for the next few years.\nWall Street windfall | $275M | Financial District\nApollo Global Management\nprovided a $275 million loan for\nRockpoint and Brooksville Company\u2019s\nresidential tower at 63-67 Wall Street. The two buildings are converted offices with more than 800 total units. The partners purchased the adjacent buildings from DTH Capital and Metro Loft Management in 2016 for $421.5 million, utilizing a\n$280 million loan\nfrom Wells Fargo. Since then, ownership has renovated the properties, upgrading common areas and amenity spaces.\nLogistics loot | $235M | Maspeth\nNew York Life Insurance Company\nprovided a $235 million loan for RXR Realty and LBA Logistics\u2019 vertical warehouse at\n55-15 Grand Avenue\nin Maspeth, Queens. The fresh financing replaces a $316 million loan from JPMorgan Chase.\u00a0 The partners\nspent $72 million in January 2018 on parcels\nfor the\nfive-story warehouse\nand\nAmazon agreed to lease the space\nfor its network of last-mile delivery warehouses.\nStorage swag\u00a0 | $143M | Long Island City\nBank of Montreal\nprovided a $143 million loan to Storage Deluxe for two industrial buildings on 21st and 22nd streets in Long Island City, Queens. The fresh financing replaces an $87 million CMBS loan. The properties at 41-45 21st Street and 41-54 22nd Street span a total of 277,601 square feet.\nRabsky refi | $140M | Fort Greene\nMadison Realty Capital\nprovided a $140 million loan for Rabsky Group\u2019s nearly-completed residential tower at\n240 Willoughby Street\n. The\nsecretive developer led by Simon Dushinsky\nis building a 30-story, 300-unit multifamily building near Fort Greene Park. It also plans to renovate an existing 21-story apartment project with 189 units. Rabsky secured a $72 million construction loan in 2022 from SCALE, the lending arm of Slate Property Group.\nFlatbush funds | $98M | Park Slope, Prospect Heights\nDerby Copeland Capital\nprovided a $98 million loan to Ed and Michael Ostad for their purchase of\na large portfolio of properties\nalong Flatbush Avenue. The Ostads bought the 26-building portfolio of mixed-use properties from Brooklyn\u2019s Pintchik family for $102.5 million.\nShelling out cash | $75M | Coney Island\nGoldman Sachs\nprovided a $74.8 million loan for Elie Fouerti\u2019s multifamily development at 2971 Shell Road in Coney Island. Fouerti Realty and Rybak Development wrapped up construction last year on the eight-story, 189-unit rental building, according to\nNew York YIMBY\n. The fresh financing replaced a $74.8 million construction loan from Popular Bank.",

Brokers in the Hamptons\njoined others\nin markets across the country tapped for accolades based on their sales volume, number of transactions and gross commission income in 2024.\nDouglas Elliman claimed the title of the top brokerage in the Hamptons in\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nlatest ranking\n. The brokerage closed nearly $1.5 billion in sales across more than 430 deals between June 2023 and June 2024.\n\u201cI am incredibly proud of this continued success,\u201d Tom Bourgard, head of Elliman\u2019s operations across Long Island, wrote in a statement.\nThomas Cavallo took home the prize for the most sales and commissions earned last year by an individual agent. Though the Sag Harbor-based broker didn\u2019t land the leading post in 2023, has\npreviously ranked\namong the firm\u2019s top producers in the region.\nSecond place went to Martha Gundersen, who was one of the three top finishers in the categories last year. Gundersen, alongside the No. 3 agent by GCI and sales volume Paul Brennan, was the listing agent for an East Hampton property that landed among the\ntop 10 most expensive\ndeals in the hamlet in 2024. The mansion at 253 Cove Hollow Road sold for $19.2 million.\n\nGundersen placed 17th among\nTRD\u2019s ranking\nof the top-producing agents and teams in the Hamptons between June 2023 and June 2024 with nearly $91 million in sales.\nKristy Naddell on the North Fork closed the highest number of transactions for the fourth consecutive year.\nThe Enzo Morabito Team scored the No. 1 spot by sales volume, transactions and GCI. The team also snagged fourth place in\nTRD\u2019s\nlatest ranking with roughly $150 million in sales across 46 deals.\nAlso notable among the teams honored in the Ellies was Noble Black &amp; Partners, who landed among the 10 groups with the largest sales volume last year. The cohort, which was the No. 2 megateam companywide, only officially\nexpanded to the Hamptons\nin May.\nOn the rest of Long Island, Maggie Keats was the top agent by GCI and sales volume, while Barbara Leogrande was the No. 1 in transactions. The Maria Babaev Team was the top-producing team by GCI and sales volume, with the Lina Lopes Team notching the highest number of transactions.\n",

        "content": "The New York mayoral race is very crowded, and newly released campaign filings show where real estate high-ups are placing their bets.\nAfter much speculation, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo\nlaunched\nhis campaign this month and quickly became the frontrunner. Despite the industry\u2019s complicated relationship with the politician, it was clear that many real estate professionals would back his campaign.\nDonations over the last two months\nbore that out\n.\nRXR Realty CEO Scott Rechler, a longtime supporter of Cuomo, gave Fix the City, a super PAC backing the former governor, $250,000. Rechler also donated $2,100 directly to Cuomo\u2019s campaign, the maximum amount permitted for an individual donor.\nLightstone executives gave the PAC $100,000, and A&amp;E\u2019s Douglas Eisenberg chipped in $125,000. Anthony Scarmucci\u2019s Skybridge Capital threw the PAC $100,000. Scarmucci and his wife also each gave $2,100 to Cuomo\u2019s campaign.\nOther industry donors to Cuomo\u2019s campaign include Cammeby\u2019s Avi Schron, KRE Group\u2019s Jonathan Kushner, Capstone Equities\u2019 Daniel Ghadamian, Ruben Companies\u2019 Andrew and Richard Ruben, Somerset\u2019s Keith Rubenstein, GFP\u2019s Jeff Gural and BFC Partners\u2019 Winthrop Wharton, each giving $2,100.\nNotably, some employees of New York-based title insurance companies also gave to Cuomo,\ndespite the state\u2019s attempts\nto reel in the industry\u2019s practice of wining and dining its clients during his time as governor.\nIn just two weeks, Cuomo raked in a total of $1.5 million, the most of any mayoral candidate (excluding public matching funds). Assembly member Zohran Mamdani raised the second-highest amount, taking in roughly $847,000 between Jan. 12 and March 13. Whitney Tilson received $310,000 during that time, and Comptroller Brad Lander raised nearly $228,000.\nAs for the others: Sen. Zellnor Myrie took in $136,000; Comptroller Scott Stringer, $188,000; Sen. Jessica Ramos, $70,000; and Republican Curtis Sliwa, $76,000 (which is also the total he has raised to date).\nCity Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, who recently jumped into the race and lost out on more than a month of fundraising during this filing period, managed to bring in $128,000 over a few days. Mayor Eric Adams took in a paltry $36,000 over the last two months, though he brushed off the totals raised by his rivals, telling reporters on Monday that \u201ceveryone is catching up to me,\u201d\nThe City reported\n.\nThe real estate industry, however, didn\u2019t just donate to Cuomo. Between Jan. 12 and March 13, real estate professionals, including veterans and lesser-known operators, contributed to Democratic mayoral candidates, with a few even throwing money to Sliwa.\nGeorgetown Companies\u2019 Adam Flatto, for example, gave $2,100 to former hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson in January. Flatto was joined by John Zeiler, founder and managing member of Hudson Housing Capital, who donated $1,000 to Tilson\u2019s campaign.\nTilson also drew $400 from GFP Real Estate co-CEO Brian Steinwurtzel and $250 from Cayre Group\u2019s Robert Cayre. Two Trees Managements\u2019 Jed Walentas, who also chairs the Real Estate Board of New York, gave $250 to Tilson, the same amount he donated to Cuomo\u2019s campaign. During the last filing period, Walentas contributed $400 to Sen. Zellnor Myrie.\n\nDespite being one of the top money-raising candidates, Assembly member Mamdani, a democratic socialist who has pledged to freeze rents for tenants living in stabilized apartments, didn\u2019t woo any large real estate donors. Instead, he received small donations, ranging from $5 to $100, from roughly a dozen residential and commercial brokers.\nCity Council Speaker Adrienne Adams officially launched her campaign a week after Cuomo, giving her the shortest time to raise funds. Even with the passage of the Fairness in Apartment Rental Expenses, or FARE Act, the Real Estate Board of New York showed Adams some support in her first fundraising haul.\nREBNY, through the PAC Taxpayers for an Affordable New York, gave Adams $2,100.\n\u201cAdrienne Adams has advanced a pro-growth agenda as Speaker, most notably in her support for City of Yes,\u201d REBNY President Jim Whelan said in a statement. He noted the passage of the broker fee bill, which requires landlords to pay the rental brokers they hire rather than forcing tenants to cover the cost, during her tenure was \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d but said she is an \u201cimportant voice to the Mayor\u2019s race.\u201d REBNY has\nfiled a lawsuit\nto repeal the law.\nSignature Urban Properties\u2019 Alan Miller gave Adams $400, as did Taconic Partners\u2019 Paul Pariser and Andy Zlotnick. GFP\u2019s Jeffrey Gural donated $250.\nEven if she doesn\u2019t win the primary in June, Adams will continue to serve as City Council Speaker through the end of the year, meaning that she has considerable sway over legislation and land use actions that come before her members.\nSen. Zellnor Myrie was the first of the mayoral candidates to roll out an extensive housing plan, which has earned him\nsome points with developers\n. Haussmann Development founder Josef Goodman gave Myrie $1,800. L+M Development Partners\u2019 Ron Moelis contributed $400, the same amount he donated to Cuomo\u2019s campaign.\nGilbert Winn of Boston-based Winn Companies gave Sen. Jessica Ramos $2,100 in January and then gave the same amount to Cuomo in March. Hudson Companies\u2019 Joe Riggs donated $150 to her campaign, the same amount he gave Comptroller Brad Lander in January.\nLander, meanwhile, received $2,100 from Millennium Partners Management\u2019s Philip Lovett. He also brought in donations from residential agents and nonprofit housing groups.\nBenjamin Companies\u2019 Kenneth Coyle contributed $2,100 to former Comptroller Scott Stringer, and Coldwell Banker kicked in $500.\nCory Zelnik of the commercial brokerage Zelnik &amp; Company gave Republican Curtis Sliwa $250. Marcus &amp; Millichap\u2019s Eric Anton donated $100.\nMayor Eric Adams, meanwhile, only took in a little more than $36,000 over the last two months, with a couple of donations from smaller real estate players. Once a favorite of the industry, some in real estate\nbacked off\ngiving to his campaign after he was\nindicted\nin September.\nThough many candidates have announced what they expect to receive in public matching funds based on this latest filing period, the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board will determine those amounts on April 15.\n",

        "content": "The city is gearing up for a rezoning that could bring 12,000 homes to Jamaica, Queens.\nWith nine months left of the first (and possibly last) term of the Adams administration, one neighborhood rezoning is on the cusp of being approved by the City Council, one just started public review and another is about to do the same on Thursday.\nCity Planning will certify the plan to rezone a swath of Jamaica to allow for the construction of more than 12,000 homes in the Queens neighborhood, of which 4,000 would be income-restricted through the city\u2019s Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program. In fact, this would be the largest MIH area ever mapped, according to City Planning. The administration also projects that the rezoning could net 2 million square feet of commercial space.\nThe certification kickstarts the monthslong land use review process, known as the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure. The plan covers more than 300 blocks in and around Downtown Jamaica and will ultimately need buy-in from local Council members Nantasha Williams and James Gennaro, as well as City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, all of whose districts will be affected by the rezoning.\nHere\u2019s a quick recap of where the Adams administration\u2019s neighborhood rezonings stand:\n\u2014 The\nAtlantic Avenue rezoning\nis in the home stretch. On Wednesday, City Planning approved the plan, affecting a 21-block stretch in Central Brooklyn, which the city expects 4,600 new homes will be built. The plan now heads to the City Council.\n\u2014 In August, the City Council\napproved\nthe rezoning of 46 blocks in the Bronx, where a projected 7,000 homes are expected to be built over the next 10 years.\n\u2014\u00a0City Planning\nkicked off public review\nof the Midtown South rezoning in January, which would bring 9,700 units to the area.\n\u2014 The city released a draft for the planned Long Island City rezoning\nlast June\n, which could create 14,000 units.\nOf course the unit projections depend on developers having the appetite to build said units. Right now, the environment for ground-up development isn\u2019t, shall we say, great. Developers have bemoaned interest rates, high construction costs, the threat of tariffs and the wage requirements for projects looking to receive the property tax break 485x.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking abou\nt: What would it take for one of the mayoral candidates to overtake Andrew Cuomo as the presumptive frontrunner before the June primary? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nJamaica, Queens, is named after\u2026 beavers? The neighborhood is not named after the Caribbean island but is believed to instead derive from \u201cjameco,\u201d the Algonquin word for \u201cbeaver,\u201d\naccording to the New York Times\n.\n\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\nA fourth person in New York has been diagnosed with measles, Gov. Kathy Hochul confirmed on Wednesday. About 81 percent of 2-year-olds in New York have received their first dose of the MMR vaccine, despite federal recommendations that children get the shot between 12 and 15 months old,\nGothamist reports\n. Three of the confirmed cases were in NYC, with one reported out of Suffolk County.\n\u2014\nIt is the end of an era. The MTA will stop selling MetroCards at the end of the year\n,\nthe New York Times reports\n.\n\u2014 Former First Deputy Mayor Maria-Torres Springer has a new gig,\nCity &amp; State reports\n. She is starting a fellowship at the Ford Foundation.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Wednesday was\n$6 million\nfor a 1,264-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at 685 Fifth Avenue in the Plaza District. McKenzie, Jade Mills and Alexander Boriskin of Douglas Elliman\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$68.5 million\nfor a 92,722-square-foot, 105-unit apartment building at 237 11th Street in Park Slope. Davidson Kempner sold the property to Living, N.Y.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$18.7 million\nfor a 3,851-square-foot condo at 33 East 74th Street in Lenox Hill. Kevin B. Brown and Craig George of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 60,702-square-foot, five-story school building at 1472 Boston Road in Crotona Park East. Matthew McChesney of KSS Architects filed the permit on behalf of Civic Builders.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "A Holmby Hills mansion tied to one of Los Angeles fashion\u2019s most prominent families is back on the market as it tries another price on for size.\nThe Azria Estate at 10250 West Sunset Boulevard, which has been\non and off the market\nfor the better part of a decade, once asked for as much as $88 million. It more recently reentered the Los Angeles real estate market with a $39 million asking price, after last being listed for $55 million in 2023.\nThe re-list comes after seller Lubov Azria, who owned the property with her late husband and BCBG founder Max Azria, placed the home on the auction block last May. Auctioneer Concierge Auctions estimated in the lead up to the sale the starting price could be as much as $38 million.\nLubov Azria did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday on the listing.\nA legal tussle arising after the auction\u2019s close has since stymied any movement on a sale of the property, which even\nJennifer Lopez\nhad been reportedly eyeing in the fall.\nRon Burkle\n, founder of private equity firm Yucaipa Companies, claimed in a Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit last June that his $30 million offer was the highest bid, but Azria \u201crefused to complete the sale except on additional terms.\u201d\nAaron Gordon, general counsel for Concierge Auctions, confirmed in a declaration filed in court Burkle had the winning bid but did not sign the sale agreement or pay the 12 percent escrow deposit within the two-business-day deadline. The tardiness caused Burkle to be in default.\n\nBurkle is now on the hook to pay a little over $36,000 for Azria\u2019s attorney fees and other lawsuit-related costs, a judge ordered in September. Three months later, Burkle filed to drop his lawsuit.\nWith the legal row out of the way, Azria will now try her hand once again at finding a buyer. She tapped The Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Branden Williams and Rayni Williams to market the property, which sits on a nearly 3-acre lot.\nThe agents did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday on the re-listing or the new price.\nThe Azria Estate counts a total of 60 rooms, including 14 bedrooms and 25 bathrooms.\nThe sizable property has been used to host Oscar parties, charity gatherings and other events.\nBuilt in 1939, the Paul Williams-designed Colonial consists of a main house and a separate 5,500-square-foot theater and game room. Outdoors is a tennis court, infinity pool, sauna, gardens, team room and greenhouse.\n",

        "content": "Four years after Los Angeles Council member Nithya Raman introduced a motion to clear out\nillegal, unregistered Airbnb and other short-term rental operations\n, the city may finally be cracking down.\nThe City Council unanimously voted Tuesday to explore how to increase enforcement of its home-sharing ordinance and residential hotel rules,\nCity News Service reported\n.\nThe council directed city departments to report on how much money and people they would need to take action.\nWhat\u2019s not clear is why it took four years for Los Angeles to consider addressing the problem.\nIn 2021, Raman, a Democrat, introduced a motion seeking to address problems with cracking down on illegal home sharing, which she said were \u201cdestabilizing\u201d neighborhoods. It was backed by fellow Democrats \u2014 Council member Bob Blumenfield and former Council members Mike Bonin, Paul Koretz and Kevin de Le\u00f3n.\nThe reason: illegal home-sharing had ushered in party houses, unauthorized events, and large yoga retreats, clothing boutiques and other commercial ventures, according to Raman. They\u00a0 also led to violent crime and homicides.\nIllegal home-sharing operations also buck up against legal brick-and-mortar businesses, allowing illegal advantages against tenants who rent commercial storefronts, from yoga studios to banquet halls.\nIllegal rentals \u201ctake your neighbors away and they remove affordable and protected rent-stabilized units from the long-term housing market, which is bad for L.A.,\u201d Raman stated in her motion.\nRaman said her constituents have been \u201cparticularly impacted.\u201d The Fourth District, which she represents, had the highest volume of both permitted and illegal home-sharing, putting a dent in its quality of life.\n\nSince the Home-Sharing Ordinance took effect in 2019\n, there have been problems with enforcement because of poor communication between departments and weak guardrails against bad landlords, Raman said.\nThe law regulates home-sharing through Airbnb, among other platforms.\n\u201cGood hosts go to extraordinary lengths to ensure they\u2019re in compliance with our laws,\u201d Raman said. \u201cWe should reward them and make sure that bad-faith hosts are treated with the appropriate enforcement actions.\u201d\nA property owner with a home of 2,500 to 5,000 square feet who has violated the ordinance would face a $3,000 penalty. Subsequent fines would be doubled.\nThe city may increase fines based on square footage of a rental in use during a violation.\nAmong the proposals to beef up enforcement is a public database for permit and citation information, making it easier to file complaints and submit evidence.\nThe Los Angeles Housing Department requested 18 new positions to help with investigations and issuing citations. As of October, about 300 administrative citations were referred to housing regulators, out of an estimated 7,500 home-sharing violators, according to a report.\nCity officials requested more staff to aid the City Attorney\u2019s Office with hearings and nuisance cases, which could lead to more revenue for enforcement.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

To move forward, approvals will be needed from the Chicago Plan Commission, Committee on Zoning, and City Council.\n\nThe area has seen\nan influx of interest from developers and real estate investors\nahead of the presidential center\u2019s planned spring 2026 completion. It has also stoked fears of gentrification in the surrounding Woodlawn Neighborhood.\nNeighborhood leaders have proposed various anti-gentrification efforts in the area, including the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance. The ordinance established affordability requirements on all rental and for-sale housing developed on city-owned residential land and gave tenants the\nright of first refusal\nwhen a rental property is sold.\nThe right of first refusal is meant to prevent the area\u2019s naturally occurring affordable housing \u2014 particularly two- to four-flats \u2014 from being replaced with pricey residential developments. The provision requires landlords to notify tenants when they intend to sell and give them time to match the bid of a third-party buyer.\nChicago\u2019s hotel development pipeline has fallen to the lowest level in recent years as construction lending froze up, with fewer than 1,500 rooms under construction in the fourth quarter, CoStar\nreported\n.",

The city had 47.5 percent fewer office visits in February 2025, compared with the pre-Covid month of February 2019, while Chicago saw a 48.5 percent decline in the same time period.\nThe nationwide figure is off 36.3 percent, with top markets like New York and Miami only 17 percent and 20 percent behind their respective 2019 office visits. The figures are based on cell phone data from about 1,000 office buildings across the country, typically about 100 buildings per market, and do not include government properties for privacy and security reasons.\nChicago and San Francisco have been the bottom two markets for RTO while New York City and Miami have been at the top since the location analytics company began tracking office visit data in early 2021, according to R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai. The Windy City\u2019s freezing February and the commute-snarling construction on its roadways, along with tech employers pushing more days in office, may have finally lifted San Francisco out of last place, said Hottovy, who is based in Chicago.\n\u201cCongratulations San Francisco!\u201d Hottovy joked of the second-to-last victory. \u201cIt\u2019s been a horse race between these two markets for some time now.\u201d\nIn addition, while Placer.ai data shows that RTO appears to be stalling out in many cities, San Francisco is still improving. Nationwide, there was a 6.3 percent drop in office visits in February 2025 compared to February 2024, and only 3.5 percent of that drop can be attributed to last year\u2019s extra day for Leap Year. But San Francisco figures were only down 1 percent, the third-best in the nation after Miami and Boston, which were both at about half a percent below last year. Chicago office visits were down 8.2 percent in that same period.\n\u201cThere are green shoots everywhere in San Francisco, and these numbers are an early indication that we are moving in the right direction,\u201d Mayor Daniel Luire, who\nrecently set an April 28 deadline\nfor city workers to be in-office four days a week, told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cOur administration is leading by example, and many of our partners in the private sector are on the same page, bringing workers back to the office and kickstarting our downtown recovery.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco Chief Economist Ted Egan cautioned that Placer\u2019s office data \u201cshows a lot of volatility\u201d from month to month, and is just one indicator of RTO strength. But combined with other data points, like increased transit ridership and office demand, it adds up to \u201cgood news for the city\u2019s continuing economy recovery,\u201d he said.\nHottovy agreed that he\u2019d like to see a few more months of improved office visit data before he could call the RTO improvement a true trend, but that even this first month out of last place is \u201cencouraging.\u201d\nPopulation numbers have recently started to rise in the city, he said, and\ntech mandates on RTO\nwill continue to have a big impact as well.\n\u201cMaybe there\u2019s some hope,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe this is the first month of more pronounced recovery in terms of return to office, but it really is too soon to say.\u201d\nThere were 2.2 million square feet of office leased in San Francisco in the first quarter of 2025, according to early data from CBRE, slightly less than the fourth quarter of 2024 but 50 percent higher than the full first quarter of 2024. If San Francisco continues on this leasing trajectory, it will exceed the 8 million square feet leased in all of 2024, according to Colin Yasukochi, executive director of data for CBRE.\nThere were about 5 million square feet of office requirements in the first quarter, which is lower than previous quarters, but represents the highest level of company expansions since the pandemic at just over 20 percent of the total. Almost all of that growth demand is coming from the 30\nAI companies\nwhich are seeking a combined 1 million square feet of office space in the city, Yasukochi said.\nInvestors\ncertainly seem to be betting on San Francisco\u2019s recovery, according to Yardi data. San Francisco was the third-priciest market nationally, with office properties trading at $282 per square foot in the first two months of the year, compared with $177 per square foot nationally and $67 per square foot in Chicago.\n",

        "content": "In a rarity for commercial real estate these days, the value of a Montauk asset jumped after a short stay in special servicing.\nGurney\u2019s Montauk Resort &amp; Seawater Spa\n\u2014 owned by Lloyd Goldman\u2019s BLDG Management \u2013\u00a0was recently reappraised at $280 million, a 15 percent increase from its $244 million value when the loan was made in 2021.\nA spokesperson for BLDG did not immediately comment.\nWhen the loan was first issued, the high-end resort was the toast of the island. DBRS Morningstar said the hotel \u201cperformed extremely well\u201d during the early days of Covid as wealthy New Yorkers flocked to it for a close-to-home oceanside sojourn. But the $271 million loan ultimately landed in special servicing for maturity default in\nlate 2024\n, a transfer BLDG chalked up to an administrative hiccup that delayed the loan extension.\nDespite loan data showing a years-long trend of declining occupancy and revenue that could not cover monthly mortgage payments, the BLDG team stressed that the deal was in good shape.\n\u201cThe hotel continues to thrive and remains an outstanding asset in the portfolio,\u201d BLDG COO Justin Kleinman said in January.\n\nAround that time, Gurney\u2019s was shuttered for renovations.\nIn February, the resort reopened and BLDG scored another year to pay off the debt. The trade-off: a $9.4 million\npaydown\nof the loan and a $3.1 million personal guarantee.\nThrough the paydown, BLDG was able to hit a debt yield hurdle \u2014 a means to measure asset health by weighing revenue against the loan amount. The $3 million served as an extra cushion if income slipped.\nAny time an asset transfers to special servicing, it typically receives an updated appraisal.\nThe resort\u2019s facelift, which is ongoing, likely drove the value bump. Gurney\u2019s soft-launched The Dune Caf\u00e9 &amp; Lounge earlier this winter, according to the\nNew York Post\n. Two other restaurants, Gigi\u2019s Montauk and Gigi\u2019s Caf\u00e9, are set to open this spring, according to\nDan\u2019s Papers\n.\nWhen BLDG and partner Metrovest Equities bought Gurney\u2019s in 2014, the team pumped $54 million into refreshing guest rooms, common areas, amenities and restaurants and building out a $16.4 million spa that draws on ocean water to fill a full-size swimming pool.\n",

        "content": "In recent years, South Florida\u2019s office market appeared resilient to financial woes experienced elsewhere in the U.S. Major companies leased across the tri-county region, making brokers giddy. Developers announced plans for new South Florida office projects, offering flashy renderings.\nYet by now, some of these projects are canceled or paused. The progress and success of others remain in doubt due to a lack of preleasing.\nThe market \u201cwas a little bit bullish early on because you saw so many companies coming into town, lots of law firms, lots of financial firms,\u201d said Lisa Colon, a real estate development attorney at Saul Ewing. \u201cThat has definitely slowed a little bit \u2026 lenders are just requiring more.\u201d\nIndeed, while companies never preleased office space years in advance in South Florida before, this has changed. Financiers generally want to see 30 percent to 40 percent of space preleased before providing a loan for a large project. Brokers said they are seeing a revival of demand in the past three months, which they attribute to the end of uncertainty after the presidential election. But most tenants are looking for small to medium-sized offices and not big headquarter spaces, meaning the uptick in demand isn\u2019t enough to secure the preleasing necessary for major office projects.\n\u201cThe majority of the demand I am seeing right now is 5,000 square feet to 10,000 square feet or less,\u201d said Cyril Bijaoui of Longstead at Corcoran. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why it\u2019s more entry level sort of sizes, and to lease-up a mega floor plate [project], especially prelease it, that\u2019s tough.\u201d\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nanalysis of the status of office projects proposed from 2021 to 2023 shows that the larger towers are either canceled or paused. One developer put an office project on hold to focus on a smaller one.\nSkyrocketing insurance and elevated interest rates have also played a role. Although the Federal Reserve lowered the benchmark rate three times last year, after 11 aggressive hikes in 2022 and 2023, hopes for more decreases this year are dwindling. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate remains at over 4 percent, though developers tend to pay more than this to cover lenders\u2019 spread.\nPlus, the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on Canada and Mexico, as well as its deportation policies also are expected to boost construction costs. The U.S. construction industry procures most of its lumber from Canada and aluminum and steel from Canada and Mexico, according to Colon.\nHere are the South Florida\noffice\nprojects that developers are canceling and pausing, as well as those that remain in question.\nOne Brickell City Centre\nIn 2022, Swire Properties and Related Companies revealed plans for One Brickell City Centre supertall, marking likely the biggest office project ever envisioned for Miami.\nThe roughly 1,000-foot tall tower would have 1.4 million square feet of offices, with floor plates ranging from 40,000 square feet on upper floors to 60,000 square feet on lower floors. It was slated to rise at Swire\u2019s Brickell City Centre mixed use complex.\nBut in January, Swire nixed One Brickell City Centre, with President Henry Bott\ntelling\nBloomberg \u201cthe pre-leasing for that specific scheme has not materialized in the way that we had hoped.\u201d (Related wasn\u2019t involved in the project by then.)\nTo meet lenders\u2019 pre-leasing requirements, the developer would have had to secure tenants for 420,000 square feet to 560,000 square feet of the space before securing construction financing.\nWhile interest in One Brickell City Centre was strong, demand ultimately didn\u2019t meet the needed threshold, according to a source familiar with the project.\nThe 2.8-acre site at 700 Brickell Avenue and 799 Brickell Plaza is for sale. An asking price hasn\u2019t been disclosed.\nGateway Group\u2019s Mid-Beach offices\nLast year, the Giller family jumped on Miami Beach\u2019s office trend with plans for a seven-story building near Mount Sinai Medical Center.\nThe seven-story building at 976 Arthur Godfrey Road and 3915-3925 Alton Road would have had 28,200 square feet of offices on the top three levels. The family\u2019s Gateway Group was betting on both new-to-market and longtime South Florida tenants, as well as medical office demand, Ira Giller said last year.\nConstruction was supposed to start in January. Instead, the Gillers\nsold the site\nlast month.\nThey had budgeted for elevated interest rates and other economic headwinds. But once the Trump administration imposed tariffs and deportation policies, the equation changed, Giller said.\n\u201c\nThat would have a direct impact on the cost of construction. We bring in a lot of construction materials from Canada and Mexico [such as] steel and aluminum,\u201d he said. \u201cMy assessment of my cost to build didn\u2019t take into account the implementation of those elements. With 20 [percent] to 30 percent of tariffs and [deporting] 10 million people in labor, I felt like costs were going to go up significantly.\u201d\nOne Thousand Group\u2019s office-to-condos switcheroo\nOne Thousand Group \u2013\u2013 led by Louis Birdman, Kevin Venger and Michael Konig\n\u2013\u2013\nproposed a 47-story tower with 312,000 square feet of offices in Miami\u2019s Edgewater in 2023.\nIn December, One Thousand Group paid\n$53 million\nfor the 1.6-acre development site at 3601 Biscayne Boulevard and 345 and 409 Northeast 36th Street.\nYet, this time its plans are for a mixed-use branded condo tower with a helipad.\nThe move is in line with South Florida market trends. Last year, offices already experienced less interest from out-of-state firms, more\nsublease availability\nand higher interest rates, prompting some tenants to pause leasing plans. The condo market remains more resilient, with demand from out-of-state buyers continuing.\n\nIn a statement, Venger said One Thousand Group didn\u2019t switch to condos due to any issues with Miami\u2019s office market, arguing the asset class \u201cremains strong.\u201d\nThe development firm \u201cstill considers office use within its commercial programming [at the tower], but with tenants re-leasing close to lease end, preleasing is limited,\u201d Venger said.\nOne Thousand Group is best known for completing the Zaha Hadid-designed\nOne Thousand Museum\ncondo tower at 1000 Biscayne Boulevard in downtown Miami.\nAbbhi Capital hits brakes on Miami Worldcenter offices\nIn 2023, Abbhi Capital wanted to bring offices to the massive Miami Worldcenter mixed-use complex, mostly home to condos, apartments and retail.\nThe Coral Gables-based firm proposed a 33-story tower with nearly 370,000 square feet of offices, as part of a larger project that included a 59-story, 558-unit residential building.\nPlans are currently on hold, according to a source familiar with the project, declining to elaborate on the reason.\nGoldman\u2019s Core Wynwood\nGoldman Properties\u2019 Core was supposed to be an eight-story building with 99,400 square feet of offices in Miami\u2019s Wynwood.\nIn 2022, Goldman \u2013\u2013 founded by the late Tony Goldman, a pioneer developer in the neighborhood \u2013\u2013 scored approval for Core on the 0.6-acre site at 373-391 Northwest 24th Street and 376 and 390 Northwest 25th Street.\nBut construction never started.\n\u201cWe are putting it on hold because of rising construction costs and interest rates,\u201d Goldman CEO Scott Srebnick said, adding that Core is paused for about three to five years.\nYet, the firm is still betting on Wynwood\u2019s office market. This year, the city approved Goldman\u2019s five-story 2400 building with 10,000 square feet of retail and 38,000 square feet of offices. It is planned for 2400-2500 Northwest Second Avenue.\nSo how is the 2400 building a better investment now than Core? It will offer smaller suites, ranging from 1,600 square feet to 2,000 square feet, which are in high demand in Wynwood, Srebnick said.\n\u201cWynwood in particular attracts the entrepreneur, the creative user, the startup. They typically require a smaller office plate,\u201d Srebnick said. It \u201cis very much an entrepreneurial culture with small VCs, small companies, architecture firms, designers.\u201d\nConstruction is expected to start in July, he said.\nBancroft Hotel\nA hotel-to-office conversion on South Beach was first announced in 2021.\nAt the time, Boca Raton-based Pebb Capital, Coconut Grove-based Maxwelle Real Estate Group and Russell Galbut bought the shuttered five-story hotel at 1501 Collins Avenue and a building next door for $47 million from a Galbut affiliate. They announced plans to convert about half the 100,000-square-foot hotel into offices.\nThe project is paused, with other development options under review, Pebb said in a statement.\nKey International\u2019s 848 Brickell\nThe\nArdid family\u2019s\nKey International seized on Brickell\u2019s office boom in 2023 with a proposal for a 51-story, 750,000-square-foot office tower.\nThe project, called 848 Brickell, would replace Key International\u2019s existing 13-story office building on the site at 848 Brickell Avenue in Miami. The firm has its headquarters there.\nKey International, founded by patriarch Jose Ardid and led by his sons, Inigo and Diego Ardid, didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment. The firm hasn\u2019t formally canceled or announced delays of the project.\nThe Ardids aim to prelease 40 percent to 50 percent of space before pursuing construction financing, Inigo and Diego Ardid told\nTRD\nlast year.\nThe plans also come as Santander Bank and billionaire Ken Griffin pursue their own office towers in Brickell. While most of the space in each will be owner occupied, they also may offer space for lease, posing competition for 848 Brickell, amid less activity from out-of-state firms.\nSantander plans to convert its 14-story building at 1401 Brickell Avenue into a\n41-story tower\nwith about 800,000 square feet of offices. The Spanish bank has its offices at the existing building and will occupy part of the space in the new building.\nGriffin\nfiled plans\nlast summer for a supertall that will serve as headquarters for his Citadel and Citadel Securities. The tower at 1201 Brickell Bay Drive, 1221 Brickell Avenue and 1250-1260 Brickell Bay Drive also will have a luxury hotel, retail and restaurants.",

        "content": "A 250,000-square-foot shopping center in Harlem may be on the verge of defaulting on its debt. Grid Properties principal Drew Greenwald isn\u2019t sweating it.\nCo-owners Grid and the Gotham Organization could default on a $108 million mortgage backing Harlem USA at 300 West 125th Street, according to an analysis by credit rating agency KBRA\nreported\nby Crain\u2019s. Investors could take a $26 million hit on the \u201cloan of concern,\u201d according to KBRA.\nThe root of concern appears to be the 26 percent vacancy rate, which is 10 percentage points higher than the neighborhood average, according to the Department of City Planning. Modell\u2019s Sporting Goods, Chuck E. Cheese, and\nBuffalo Wild Wings closed\nduring the pandemic, but none have been replaced so far and 50,000 square feet are left empty. The vacancy rate was only 5 percent the year before the onset of the pandemic.\nThe loan is slated to come due next year, when ownership will likely face interest rates above the current 3.3 percent.\nKBRA estimated the property is worth $82 million, well below the value of the most recent mortgage.\n\nDespite long-term vacancies, co-owner Greenwald said he believes the complex will be fully leased in the next 12 months. He claims an unnamed supermarket will arrive soon and the property is generating more than enough cash to pay its bills. The KBRA analysis appears to validate that confidence, as the property is generating 170 percent of the necessary cash for existing debt obligations.\n\u201cI\u2019m not the least bit worried,\u201d Greenwald told the outlet of KBRA\u2019s analysis.\nHarlem USA, located across the street from the famed Apollo Theater, was the first property in the neighborhood to host national chains. Tenants include Old Navy, which is on a lease for 35,000 square feet set to expire in 2028, and the nine-screen AMC Magic Johnson movie theater, set to continue occupying nearly 70,000 square feet until at least 2030.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Discrimination against voucher holders has been illegal since 2008 but is still one of the most common types of housing discrimination, according to the city\u2019s Commission on Human Rights.\nThe half-dozen bills the City Council is weighing would stiffen penalties against both landlords and brokers for voucher discrimination.\n\u201cWe know the stories too well of tenants who are turned away from apartments because they are on a voucher, because they have Section 8, because they have a public benefit,\u201d said Councilmember Krishnan.\nOne proposal would add source of income discrimination to a list covered by the Certificate of No Harassment program, potentially allowing the city to deny building or construction permits. Another proposal would increase the maximum civil penalty for those who defy Commission on Human Rights orders.\n\nThe other proposals:\nBase landlord fines on the number of buildings they own, increasing penalties for large corporate landlords, a common denominator in source of income complaints\nProhibit credit history requirements for voucher holders\nRequire applicant notification if denial is based on a tenant screening report\nPublic disclosure of landlords found guilty of source of income discrimination\nRental vouchers are one option to help propel households from the city\u2019s shelter system to permanent housing. As of the end of last year, nearly 52,000 households were taking advantage of CityFHEPS vouchers alone, according to city officials.\nOpen discrimination against holders of Section 8 vouchers is\non the decline\n, Housing Rights Initiative founder Aaron Carr told\nThe Real Deal\nlast year, but prospective renters still have horror stories about being ghosted or deterred from using their subsidies.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A fast-fashion retailer\u2019s bankruptcy is leaving vacancies in 32 malls across Texas.\nForever 21 filed for bankruptcy for the second time in six years, citing rising costs and increased competition from overseas brands. The company\u2019s operator, F21 OpCo, voluntarily filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on Sunday, the Austin American-Statesman\nreported\n.\nAs part of the restructuring, Forever 21 will begin winding down its U.S. operations while searching for a buyer for its remaining assets. The retailer\u2019s stores and website will remain operational during the process. The company is seeking court approval to use cash collateral to continue paying employee wages and benefits.\nForever 21 has struggled to keep pace with low-cost competitors such as Shein and Temu, which have attracted consumers with trendy fashion at lower prices. While Forever 21 sells T-shirts for around $10, Temu offers similar items for as little as $5, for example. The growing dominance of these online retailers, coupled with economic pressures, has made it difficult for Forever 21 to maintain its market position.\nThe brand first filed for bankruptcy in 2019 before being acquired by a consortium that included Authentic Brands Group and Simon Property Group.\n\nBuying Forever 21 \u201cwas probably the biggest mistake I made,\u201d Authentic Brands CEO Jamie Salter said at a conference last year, Retail Dive\nreported\n.\nBut the brand is seeking buyers to salvage the business.\n\u201cRetail is changing, and like many brands, Forever 21 is adapting to create the right balance across stores, e-commerce and wholesale,\u201d Jarrod Weber, global president of lifestyle at Authentic Brands,\ntold\nFox Business.\nHigh occupancy, historic demand and stagnant development have defined the retail market across the Texas Triangle for the past couple of years. While big-box stores such as Conn\u2019s, Big Lots and Party City are shutting down, their spaces are often backfilled by retailers including Burlington and Ollie\u2019s Bargain Outlets, as well as various fitness concepts and specialty grocers, according to Weitzman.\nTexas\u2019 regional shopping malls are healthier after decades of decline and redevelopment. Occupancy was 93.4 percent among Dallas-Fort Worth malls at the end of last year, for example, up from 91.3 percent a year earlier, Weitzman said.\n",

        "content": "\u201cProfit\u201d is such a dirty word to some Americans it makes you wonder if they realize it has made the United States the richest nation in the world.\nWhich brings us to an astonishing rent control saga in Washington Heights.\nCovering a case pitting 78-year-old Freda Henderson against landlord Westside Ventura II LLC, Gothamist wrote, \u201cHer lawyer said in a statement that the judge\u2019s decision ensures Henderson can stay in her affordable home and protects her from the landlord\u2019s goal of evicting her to maximize profits.\u201d\n\u201cThis case is not just about one tenant,\u201d said Patrick Tyrrell of Mobilization for Justice, who represented Henderson. \u201cIt is part of a pattern of landlords exploiting legal loopholes to erode rent protections and displace long-term residents.\u201d\nWait a second. Exploiting loopholes? Eroding rent protections? Displacing residents?\nGiven the facts of the case, Tyrell\u2019s characterizations look a lot like spin. And dissecting his argument helps debunk some common myths associated with rent control and the motivations underlying both landlords and tenants.\nLet\u2019s start with his attack on profit. Setting aside whether the law entitles Henderson to a rent-controlled unit, her lawyer\u2019s demonization of profit is hypocritical.\nCapitalism works because people are trying to profit. That is why communist China switched to a market economy \u2014 pulling a billion people out of poverty and supercharging productivity. Yet Tyrell is portraying profit as a\ncause\nof poverty.\nIf the landlord is trying to \u201cmaximize profits,\u201d the tenant is trying to minimize rent. Which is really the same thing. Henderson\u2019s profit is her income (Social Security) minus expenses. Her primary expense is likely her rent, which is \u2026 wait for it \u2026 $640 a month.\n\nThat\u2019s for a two-bedroom in Manhattan, where the\nmedian rent is $4,500\n.\nTo accomplish her goal of maximizing profit, when her longtime roommate died, Henderson, who was not on the lease,\nkept paying the $640 rent in his name\nand hoped the landlord wouldn\u2019t notice. For years, he never did.\nBut in 2017 a new landlord caught on to her ruse and sought to convert the unit from rent-controlled to\nrent-stabilized\n.\nThat is how the law was designed in New York. It\u2019s not a loophole. It\u2019s the intent of the legislation. Fifty years ago, when rent control was replaced with rent stabilization, tenants were allowed to keep their rent-controlled leases until they moved out or died.\nIf the landlord can be said to be \u201cexploiting a loophole\u201d by evicting a tenant who was not on the lease, the tenant can be said to be exploiting a loophole by saying she was the previous tenant\u2019s common-law wife and thus entitled to succession rights.\nThat is what the judge ruled, by the way, although the decision could be reversed on appeal. Both sides certainly have a case. One could even argue that Henderson was the exploiter for occupying a $640-a-month two-bedroom in the name of a deceased tenant.\nBut to give the impression that the decline in rent-controlled units \u2014 from 100,000 three decades ago to 24,000 in 2023, as Gothamist noted \u2014 is \u201cpart of a pattern\u201d to \u201cdisplace long-term residents,\u201d as Tyrell said, is wrong.\nHere are the facts:\nRent control is being deliberately phased out by the state and replaced with rent stabilization. Landlords are trying to charge and collect the legal rent on their units. Westside Ventura II LLC and Freda Henderson are both trying to assert their rights under state law. The courts will decide who is right.\n",

It said the landlord was in talks\nwith lenders\nBarclays and Citigroup for months leading up to the December maturity default\nThe Real Deal\n, however, had reported in July that Maximus had\ndefaulted on $1.775 billion in loans\ntied to the blighted complex.\nIt was in 2019 that Maximus recapitalized $1.8 billion debt with $1.5 billion in senior financing from Barclays and Citi and a $275 million mezzanine loan from Aimco.\nMaximus had proposed redeveloping the World War II-era garden apartments by adding 5,700 homes, 230,000 square feet of shops and restaurants, 80,000 square feet of offices and a 64,000-square-foot community center.\nAlthough plans for its redevelopment were approved in 2011, and\nnew renderings put out\nin 2022, the project never broke ground, with Maximus founder Rob Rosania citing \u201csky-high construction costs, inflation and supply chain issues.\u201d\n\nRosania said in December his firm was planning to close a loan extension in \u201ccoming weeks.\u201d Notes sent to bondholders this month said future lender actions could include foreclosure.\nLast April, $1.8 billion in loans backed by Parkmerced were\nturned over to special servicing at the request of the landlord\n, citing high vacancy and a looming loan maturity.\nIn May, the\nSan Francisco Chronicle reported\ndozens of Parkmerced tenant complaints about broken elevators, lack of lighting in public areas, mold and mildew, leaks, car break-ins, rodents, overflowing dumpsters and squatters taking over vacant units.\nThe publication said the landlord may have cut back on security and maintenance, leading to\nrising crime and blight\n.\nParkmerced, a planned development from Metropolitan Life and designed by Leonard Schultze and Associates, opened its first apartments in 1944 for homecoming war veterans. It\u2019s the second-largest complex in the state behind L.A.\u2019s historic Park La Brea, another garden apartment complex with 4,225 units.\nDouglas Wilson, founder of his eponymously named company, said its goal will be to safeguard Parkmerced and work toward its \u201crepositioning.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been lacking capital for some time,\u201d Wilson told the Business Journal, adding his firm would address issues with life safety and spending. The company is considering bringing in a new property management firm.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "A long-neglected state-owned site in Brooklyn that has sat in redevelopment limbo for decades is once again up for grabs.\nGov. Kathy Hochul issued a request for proposals on Thursday for 1024 Fulton Street, seeking a developer to take over the 12,800-square-foot Clinton Hill site. The request comes with conditions: The new owner must build apartments where all rents are at or below 100 percent of the area median income, and the new building must include at least 100 units. The RFP also calls for a community center on the building\u2019s ground floor.\nWhoever is selected to take over the site will pay a nominal fee. The state may still opt to create a ground lease on the site rather than handing over full ownership of the property.\nPlans to redevelop the site have been snarled up in attempts to transfer the property to a nonprofit.\nIn 2014, the Cuomo administration halted plans to auction the site at the urging of then-Assembly member Walter Mosley, who wanted to sell the property to the nonprofit Northeast Brooklyn Housing Development Corp.,\nthe New York Daily News reported at the time\n. When that plan fell apart, the state legislature\napproved a bill\nin 2020 to sell the property to Philadelphia-based TCH Holdings for \u201cfair market value.\u201d\nThat proposal also didn\u2019t come to fruition because TCH didn\u2019t file the required paperwork outlining its plan for a senior center on the site,\nThe City reported\n.\n\nThe latest RFP requires that the development team be 51 percent owned by a nonprofit, and it gives a slight edge to those wholly owned by a nonprofit (five points out of a maximum of 100 a bidder can earn based on criteria outlined by the state).\nThe state budget for fiscal year 2024-2025 allocated $3.7 million to demolish the 33,000-square-foot vacant building on the site. The building served as a showroom for Brooklyn Union Gas in 1912 and then for manufacturing and commercial uses.\nThe state\u2019s Office of Children and Family Services bought the property in 1997, hoping to develop a community center. However, \u201cdue to structural issues,\u201d the agency abandoned that plan, according to the RFP. The building has since sat vacant.\nThe site\u2019s current zoning allows residential space that is four times the size of the lot (or a floor area ratio of 4), with a maximum building height of 85 feet. If a building includes affordable housing, the FAR can go up to 5 and the height to 115 feet. The RFP notes that the state is willing to override local zoning to maximize the amount of affordable housing, and will consider additional density, height and other modifications if they \u201csupport a superior design and site plan while being cost-effective.\u201d\nThe RFP for the Fulton Street site is the latest effort by the Hochul administration to build on state-owned land. The\nstate budget last year\ncreated a capital fund to build more than 15,000 homes on state-owned properties.\n",

        "content": "Miami Beach commissioners approved land use changes that will allow the Meruelo family and David Martin\u2019s Terra to build a larger project on the oceanfront property that was previously home to the Deauville Beach Resort.\nThe commission on Wednesday evening voted six to 1, with commissioner David Suarez casting the sole \u2018no\u2019 vote, on first reading to approve two amendments that would apply to the 3.8-acre oceanfront property at 6701 Collins Avenue in North Beach. Mayor Steven Meiner and commissioners Tanya Bhatt, Laura Dominguez, Alex Fernandez, Joseph Magazine and Kristen Rosen Gonzalez voted in favor.\nMartin, CEO of Terra, has been leading the charge on behalf of the Meruelos, who have a 75 percent stake in the property. Martin was brought on in part due to his reputation as a developer who negotiates successfully with local governments, helping\nwith damage control\n.\nThe Meruelo family and Terra now plan a 120-unit condo and 150-room hotel project on the site, designed by Foster + Partners, Shulman + Associates and ODP as the project architect.\nThe\nDeauville\nproperty currently has a floor area ratio, or overall project size, of 3.0 to 3.15. The developer is seeking legislative changes that would allow for an FAR of 5.5, for a project that could span nearly 916,000 square feet. The project would include a partial reconstruction of the Deauville and a proposed height of 400 feet tall.\nThe changes will require a referral to the planning board and a second reading vote from the commission, likely next month.\nThe Meruelos were heavily criticized for letting the iconic Deauville fall into disrepair to the point where it required demolition. The family has also been tied up in litigation with the city.\nThose sentiments weren\u2019t on display for the majority of the discussion at Wednesday\u2019s commission meeting. Residents and city officials spoke overwhelmingly in favor of the redevelopment.\n\u201cI want to speak to you from my heart when I tell you that this project is brilliant, and Mr. Martin, the time he has spent listening, public hearings, answering questions, I think the humanity of it is also brilliant for such a big project,\u201d said Richard Zaki, a resident at the nearby Sterling condo building.\nElizabeth Latone, who is on the city\u2019s planning board, spoke as a member of the public, begging the commission to approve the project.\n\n\u201cHow much longer can we wait? At what point is something going to be good enough for this spot? Yes, we have terrible owners. Everybody knows that they are toxic, but we can\u2019t wait anymore,\u201d Latone said.\nCommissioner Bhatt agreed.\n\u201cI hate the fact that they\u2019re going to make money off of this,\u201d she said, referring to the Meruelos. Bhatt said the city was nearing a deal to have the owners pay off millions of dollars in fines they owe the city.\nDaniel Ciraldo, executive director of the Miami Design Preservation League, supported the project and praised its design, but urged the city to remember that the Meruelos own the majority interest and asked that they negotiate a lower height.\n\u201cWe need to make sure that we\u2019re clear that the owners are also the Meruelos, and they owe millions of dollars to the city of Miami Beach, and David Martin is a very good developer, but there\u2019s another owner that a lot of us know cannot always be trusted,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt is a double height of what was there,\u201d he added. \u201cBetween first and second [reading], I hope you guys can really negotiate the height, make it even better.\u201d\nThe Deauville, built in 1957, was about 185 feet tall and 17 stories.\nThis latest proposal follows billionaire developer Steve Ross\u2019 plan to secure an FAR of 4.5, which voters\nrejected via a referendum\nin 2022. Ross entered into a contract with the Meruelos to pay $500 million for the site, but the deal was contingent on voters approving the referendum.\nIn a statement, Martin said the development team is \u201ctaking the time to get it right.\u201d The project, he wrote, \u201cwill pay tribute to the legacy of the historic Deauville.\u201d He joined the project about a year ago when Terra\npaid $12.5 million\nfor a 25 percent stake in the property.\n",

They include Banner starting demolition at the site no later than June 24, with completion expected by early August.\nBuildings like the Egg Harbor Cafe on Hale Street may remain intact, contingent on tenant operations, despite surrounding structures being boarded up in preparation for demolition.\n\nThe project has garnered mixed reactions from the community and local leaders. Former council member Scott Brown praised the investment potential but acknowledged they\u2019ve faced market challenges as construction loans have become more difficult to secure for developers since interest rates took off in 2022.\nBanner Real Estate has already submitted demolition applications ahead of the April 24 deadline. Additionally, a substantial payment of $250,000 to acquire a public alley crucial for the project\u2019s footprint has been scheduled upon demolition permit issuance.\nThe suburban Chicago multifamily market is experiencing strong rental demand, with rents rising 4.4 percent year-over-year, outpacing the city core. Despite challenges from elevated interest rates, the suburbs have become attractive for investors due to tax stability and limited new supply, leading to a competitive market.\n\u2014 Sam Lounsberry\n",

        "content": "A South Side landlord is testing how buzzy Bronzeville has become by listing two apartment buildings for $225,000 per unit.\nRaphael Lowenstiein, who previously landed in financial hot water from racking up code violations on other South Side properties, is putting two apartment buildings at 4201 and 4750 South Michigan Avenue up for sale together or separately. If the combined 45 units sold at the target price of $10.1 million, the sale would be on par with recent multifamily sales in more established real estate markets in Chicago. The properties do not have outstanding code violations.\nAssets snagging between $200,000 and $300,000 in the past year include a 17-unit complex sold in Avondale, which sold for $235,000 per unit last May; a 47-unit complex in river West that\nsold for $302,000 per unit\nthe following month; and in the West Loop,\na 274-unit tower that sold for $278,000 per unit\nin October.\nBronzeville had been experiencing a dramatic decline in population until recently, much like other areas of the South Side.\nThe neighborhood was a hub for Black population growth during the Great Migration in the early to mid-1900s, but years of disinvestment led its population to decline by more than 75 percent between 1950 and 2000, according to United Way of Metro Chicago.\nGrowth in nearby Hyde Park and the expected 2026 completion of t\nhe Obama presidential library\nin Woodlawn has spurred an influx of interest recently, along with Farpoint Development\u2019s planned\n$3.2 billion megadevelopmen\nt known as Bronzeville Lakefront.\nOn the residential side, a single family home in\nWoodlawn set a record this month\n, selling for $1.2 million, which was $400,000 more than any previous home sold in the neighborhood.\n\u201cFrom the 7100 block up to Douglas, it\u2019s all improved significantly,\u201d said SVN\u2019s Joe Connelly, who is listing agent for Lowenstein\u2019s South Michigan Avenue properties. \u201cIn Woodlawn, I was working on a deal for $200,000 a door. That would have been absolutely unheard of even four years ago.\u201d\n\nA sale at or above $200,000 per unit is not a guarantee, even with the area\u2019s growth. A two-building Hyde Park portfolio at 5111 South University Avenue and 5135 South Blackstone Avenue totaling 77 studio and one-bedroom units sold this month for $103,000 per unit.\nBut the South Michigan Avenue properties also benefit from their proximity to Bronzeville Lakefront and from larger-than-typical floorplans because they were converted from condos and renovated, Connelly said.\n\u201cLocal investors think the price per door is a little steep for Bronzeville, but it reflects the rents that they\u2019re achieving,\u201d Connelly said.\nAverage rents are close to $2,000 per unit, and the average average unit size is about 1,315 square feet, Connelly said. Some duplex units have 2,400-square-foot floorplans, he said.\nIt hasn\u2019t been smooth sailing for the buildings\u2019 owners. Raphael Lowenstein, who leads property management firm 312 Properties with his brother Ari Lowenstein, have been accused of allowing other properties they run to rack up code violations and leave tenants living in poor conditions.\nThe code violations at properties at 4520 and 4830 South Drexel Boulevard and 4612-4626 South Lake Park Avenue\nnearly led the landlords to default\non $54 million worth of CMBS loans backing the properties but they later cleared the violations and\nsecured new financing\n.\nRaphael Lowenstein did not respond to requests for comment.\n",

        "content": "Miami architect Kobi Karp pulled off a double play, scoring a green light on designs for a pair of apartment projects near Edgewater\u00a0 and Wynwood Norte.\nOn Wednesday, the\nMiami Urban Development Review Board\napproved 1600 Edgewater, Sabet Group\u2019s 33-story tower with 282 apartments, as well as Evolve Companies\u2019 Evolve Wynwood 35, an eight-story building with 141 rental units.\nBoth projects are redevelopment plays by out-of-state builders that entered the Miami market in 2022. The review board approved 1600 Edgewater and Evolve Wynwood 35 unanimously, and suggested a few minor design tweaks for both projects.\n1600 Edgewater\nLos Angeles and New-York-based Sabet Group, led by Andre and Edward Sabetfard, is developing 1600 Edgewater. The firm planted its flag in South Florida three years ago when Sabet acquired the 0.5-acre site at 1600 Northeast Second Avenue for\n$14.3 million\n. The property is in Miami\u2019s\nArts &amp; Entertainment District\n, but borders\nEdgewater\n.\nThe property is currently home to a single-story commercial building leased to a go-kart amusement company. The site is zoned for a 25-story apartment building with a maximum of 250 units, but Sabet obtained city approval for a height and unit increase through public benefits bonuses by setting aside 20 apartments for affordable housing.\n\nKarp designed the building with an eight-floor parking podium with 352 parking spaces. The planned tower will also have 9,519 square feet of retail, including a rooftop restaurant, plans show.\nEvolve Wynwood 35\nIn 2022, Evolve Companies, led by Joe McKinney and Mike Winstead Jr. entered the Miami market by dropping\n$9.8 million\nfor six lots with small single-family houses and apartment buildings at 543, 553, 579, 583, 585 and 535-539 Northwest 35th Street in Wynwood Norte.\nThe Greensboro, North Carolina-based firm tapped Karp to design Evolve Wynwood 35, which will replace the older building and homes, which were completed between 1926 and 1951. Featuring a facade painted in various colors by different artists, Wynwood 35 will also include a parking garage on the first, second and third floors with 202 spaces.\nSince 2013, Evolve has focused on multifamily and student housing projects, as well as providing construction management services, according to the firm\u2019s website. The company has more than $1 billion in assets under management with a portfolio spanning 25 million square feet and 20,000 units.\nEvolve is also planning a second project, an 11-story building with 105 apartments, in\nWynwood Norte\n. In 2022, the firm also paid\n$9 million\nfor a 0.7-acre site at 475 Northwest 36th Street.",

        "content": "Jay Paul Company has a new plan for its CityView development in downtown San Jose, swapping out some office buildings for an office-to-resi conversion, a brand new residential tower and retail.\nThe new design redevelops San Jose\u2019s CityView Plaza, which the Silicon Valley developer bought the bulk of for $283.5 million in 2018, adding two adjacent properties a year later for $100 million. That same year, the firm also bought the 19-story 50 West San Fernando Street for $238 million, bringing its holdings to about $680 million in downtown San Jose.\nOriginally plans called for three 19-story, interconnected office towers containing 3.4 million square feet of offices, shops and restaurants. The company\nasked the city for a five-year pause\non that plan last year, citing \u201ccurrent financial markets and a reduced demand for office leasing.\u201d\nNow downtown San Jose\u2019s biggest office owner is moving forward, but with a new plan for a mixed-use community with a large residential component, plus office, retail and restaurants, according to a news release from the company.\nThe Village at CityView is a 320-unit conversion of an existing four-building office campus, as well as the current 2.35-acre plaza, designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz. Apartment units will range from studios to three-bedrooms, with shared green spaces, a 10,000-square-foot fitness and wellness center, and a rooftop pool, \u201call of which enhance downtown San Jose\u2019s appeal as a vibrant place to call home,\u201d the release indicates.\n\nPhase two of the project details a brand-new 27-story apartment luxury tower, called The Tower at CityView, at 121 South Market Street. Also designed by SCB, it will have 360 units, from studios to three-bedroom penthouses, with rooftop lounges and outdoor terraces showcasing city views, along with onsite, underground parking.\nFor the retail component, The Shops at CityView will bring 35,000 square feet of retail and restaurants designed by architect DES to a \u201cdowntown environment that currently lacks similar amenities,\u201d the release says. Set to be located at the intersection of Park Avenue and Almaden Boulevard, the retail hub will \u201ccomplement\u201d the existing 15,000 square feet of street level retail in Jay Paul Company\u2019s adjacent\n19-story 200 Park\n, which houses Adobe World Headquarters, and the Center for the Performing Arts.\nThere is still a substantial office component in CityView proper with the extensive renovation of 150 Almaden, a 15-story, 204,000-square-foot Class A office building that will be \u201cmodernized to meet the evolving needs of today\u2019s high-tech workforce,\u201d according to the release. The renovation will include an upgrade to the building systems, a new lobby and tenant amenities like a conference center and fitness center. Like 200 Park, it will have three parking spots for every 1,000 square feet, which the company said would allow it to \u201ccompete with the convenience of suburban projects while offering a dynamic and exciting location in the heart of downtown.\u201d\n\u201cPeople want to live, work and play in the safest big city in the Bay,\u201d San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan said in a statement, calling the project \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d for its ability to help the city \u201creimagine what the capital of Silicon Valley looks and feels like\nin the age of AI.\u201d\nPaul did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the overhauled plans but said in a statement that, \u201cDowntown is evolving into a powerhouse of innovation, culture and commerce, and we\u2019re excited to be part of\nthat.\u201d\n",

        "content": "One of the nation\u2019s biggest construction lenders has given Nick Marietti the fuel he needs to start construction on a suburban Chicago rental project.\nMarietti\u2019s Schaumburg-based firm VennPoint Real Estate closed on $55 million in financing, led by Bank OZK\u2019s nearly $46 million construction loan, for the 144-unit townhome project slated for Five Parkway North Boulevard in Deerfield, according to a news release.\nThe developer scored the remaining $9.9 million in funding from an undisclosed insurance company in the form of a mezzanine loan.\nThe deal underscores growing interest in suburban Chicago townhome developments. Chicago-based JDI Realty last year spent $34 million on buying up a portfolio of 164 townhomes throughout Chicago\u2019s surroundings that the seller had built up over 14 years.\nVennPoint purchased the approximately 10 acres targeted for construction for $10.2 million, from its previous owner, Deerfield-based Quadrangle, which spent a little more than $5.8 million to buy the land in 2015, public record show. The development site is adjacent to a multi-building corporate office complex that includes the 258,000-square-foot\nOne Parkway North\nbuilding, whose landlord Joseph Horn is in default on a $12.7 million loan.\n\nThe residential development is dubbed Park5 and will include two- and three-bedroom layouts averaging a little more than 1,900 square feet each, with two-car attached garages and private yards and outdoor space \u2014 rarities for traditional multifamily rentals.\nVennPoint\u2019s plan is to set aside 14 units as affordable to comply with Deerfield\u2019s housing regulations, it told public officials in October. Its original plan was to build 147 units, but it scaled that slightly back to 144. The financing pencils out to $382,000 per unit.\nJLL\u2019s Matthew Schoenfeldt and Mary Dooley represented VennPoint in its deal for the construction debt. JLL\u2019s Dan Reynolds and Chris Cummins advised the land seller Quadrangle.\nThe project is one of several rental developments coming to Deerfield. Wisconsin-based Continental Properties last year raked in a $54 million construction loan to pursue a 254-unit rental project, with 25 units designated as affordable, near Interstate 94 and South Waukegan Road. Separately, Chicago-based Celadon Partners is kicking off a $70 million plan to replace an office complex at 1101 Lake Cook Road with an affordable senior housing community.\n",

        "content": "For one glorious week last June, the city opened a rent-voucher portal that had been closed for 15 years.\nThrough the magic door rushed 600,000 New Yorkers applying for Section 8, which comes from the federal government and is distributed by the New York City Housing Authority. NYCHA gets the money from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and forwards it to landlords. But first, it has to award Housing Choice Vouchers to tenants.\nFrom those applicants, NYCHA selected 200,000 by lottery. Cue the politicians.\nMayor Eric Adams, in a\npress release\n, touted the \u201cmuch-needed relief to families searching for affordable housing.\u201d And then-Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer said it \u201cwill be a lifeline to 200,000 New Yorkers who need affordable housing.\u201d\nThese statements were a stretch, to say the least.\nNo, 200,000 New Yorkers did not get a lifeline. They got on a waiting list to get a lifeline.\nAnd the lifeline has no apartment on the other end of it. Tenants have\n180 days\nto find a unit eligible for the voucher and a willing landlord \u2014 not easy in a city with a\n1.4 percent vacancy rate\n.\nNow, the punchline: Nine months after the application window closed, NYCHA has worked its way through 12,000 applications and only 318 have succeeded. In a city with nearly 6 million renters, 318 is the statistical equivalent of zero.\nThe numbers are mind-boggling. Only 1 of every 45 tenants handed a voucher has rented an apartment with it. At its current pace, NYCHA will take nine more years to get through the 188,000 people on the waitlist. Last time it took 15 years.\nWhat are the lessons here? Besides not trusting quotes from politicians, that is.\n\nOne takeaway is that the ongoing battles over vouchers are a sideshow if the programs don\u2019t get people into apartments and money in landlords\u2019 pockets.\nThe City Council is fighting the Adams administration for more CityPHEPS vouchers, and New York City landlord and tenant groups are doing the same in Albany for state vouchers. More efficiency should be at least as high of a priority.\nThe New York Apartment Association has made this point often, but the process remains tedious, overly bureaucratic and often arbitrary. A tenant could beat the deadline, only to have an inspector reject the apartment for some picayune reason. Hello, homeless shelter.\nAn even more overlooked lesson is that the\nvacancy rate is too low\nfor vouchers to achieve their potential. City lawmakers have not done enough to increase the supply of multifamily housing, and state legislators have done virtually nothing.\nA final point: State law should be changed to allow the full value of vouchers to be used at rent-stabilized apartments. Right now, the \u201clegal rent\u201d is the maximum the landlord can receive, even if the voucher is worth more.\nThis means, for Section 8, New York is leaving federal money on the table, even as our politicians complain about Congress and the Trump administration cutting Medicaid and other funding (this\n$80 million\n, for example).\nTenants with Housing Choice Vouchers don\u2019t make much money. The income threshold for an individual is $54,350 a year and $69,900 for a family of three.\nLetting them use their vouchers in full would give them a huge advantage over non-voucher holders (who are typically wealthier) in securing rent-stabilized units, which are about half of all rental units in the city. For probably the only time in their lives, they could actually outbid rich people.\nThis would make rent stabilization more like an affordable housing program, boost revenue at buildings that desperately need it for operating expenses and repairs and steer higher earners into market-rate units, where they belong.\nSome groups purportedly advocating for tenants oppose any change to this rule. They don\u2019t want landlords to get more money. There is no obvious policy rationale except to force more buildings into foreclosure.\n",

        "content": "Disclaimer: This is a worst-case scenario.\nYou\u2019re a landlord, or a co-op or condo board, and you install UL-rated gas detectors above your building\u2019s gas stoves and dryers by May 1, as required by\nLocal Law 157\n.\nBefore long, one starts beeping. A tenant calls 911 and, fearing an explosion, hangs up and leaves the apartment. The dispatcher can see the address but doesn\u2019t know in which unit the alarm sounded. She sends the Fire Department to investigate the potential gas leak.\nThe FDNY arrives, but cannot figure out where the alarm came from. The tenant who called is unreachable. Twenty minutes pass. Because gas might be building up in a unit, creating the potential for an explosion, the FDNY shuts off gas to the entire building.\nThe tenant finally returns and lets firefighters into her unit. They open the windows, turn the stove knobs to the off position and tell the tenant to come back in an hour. Everything\u2019s back to normal, right?\nWrong. Your building must pass a pressure test for gas service to be turned back on. On the first try, it fails. So you have plumbers pull every gas stove and dryer out from the wall, cap all the pipes, and run a second pressure test. Another fail.\nThe building is old, and the pipes have shifted or corroded over time. Somewhere, probably in several places, there are leaks. But where? No one knows.\nYou\u2019re faced with two unpalatable options: re-pipe the entire building or re-wire it and go electric, like\nthis Yonkers complex is doing\n. Either way, the cost is well into the six figures for a small building, and millions for a larger one.\nFor a co-op, that can mean refinancing your mortgage and raising your dues. For a rent-stabilized building, there\u2019s no way to recover the cost, because the state strangled the Major Capital Improvements program in 2019.\n\nWhatever solution you choose will take months, if not longer. Meanwhile, everyone is using hot plates, ordering in or demanding to be relocated.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nSource-of-income discrimination was the most common source of housing discrimination complaints to the city\u2019s Human Rights Commission last fiscal year, with\n554\n. But is the problem still \u201cpervasive,\u201d as City Limits claimed in\nthis story\nabout new City Council bills targeting the crime? Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Sublet specialist\nRuth Colp-Haber\nof Wharton Property Advisors has a block on the computer of her colleague/husband Eric to make sure he is not distracted by NCAA basketball during work hours.\nElsewhere\u2026\nThe Atlantic Avenue rezoning \u2014 dubbed AAMUP \u2014 was approved by the City Planning Commission, which was a formality because it is an Adams administration initiative and the mayor appoints most of the commissioners.\nBut it\u2019s a good opportunity to debate the issues that have plagued the city\u2019s housing market, particularly the notion that rezoning for \u201cluxury\u201d (actually mixed-income) development makes the problem worse.\nThe Atlantic\u2019s\nJacob Anbinder\nhas spent years trying to debunk the myth that \u201cnew luxury housing is the reason that former working- and middle-class neighborhoods in their cities have become fancy enclaves.\u201d\n\u201cNot only is it a simplistic analysis that absolves nearly anyone who isn\u2019t a developer of responsibility for the problem,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut in portraying new housing as the proximate cause of gentrification, it exacerbates the very housing crisis it seeks to solve.\u201d\nClosing time\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "Developers Jeff Shapack and Shawn Clark are a step closer to starting construction on a massive Fulton Market mixed-use project by closing in on a luxury hotel operator.\nGlobal Ambassador, an upstart five-star hotel brand with a 141-room Phoenix location, is nearing a deal to run the lodging component of Shapack Partners\u2019 and CRG\u2019s planned development at 170 North Green Street, according to people familiar with the deal.\nThe hotel could take space within a 40-story mixed-use building approved by the city for the site. The plans also include office, retail and apartments, but the developers may still end up further emphasizing one use while scaling back others as they and competitors with shovel-ready sites in Fulton Market vie for corporate tenants.\nA Global Ambassador arrangement isn\u2019t closed, but if kept on track, it would add another high-end hotel option to Chicago\u2019s hottest neighborhood for commercial real estate, which already includes a Nobu hotel as well as Soho House and the Hoxton.\nIts ultimate outcome will be determined in large part by the office market, which across the nation has become increasingly concentrated in high-end new buildings within transforming neighborhoods, such as Fulton Market.\nMeanwhile, the Shapack-CRG venture behind the 170 North Green plan is eagerly awaiting decisions by potential office tenants scouting development sites in the area, according to market sources. As are Sterling Bay and Related Midwest, which respectively have city-approved office tower plans at\n330 North Green Street\nand 725 West Randolph Street.\nThe logjam in the development market could be unlocked with a move to anchor one of those potential towers by a handful of firms in the financial, legal and consulting sectors considering Fulton Market office space, although commercial real estate decision-making has slowed this year as economic uncertainty ballooned, leasing brokers have said.\nThe Global Ambassador deal could also be put on hold should a major office deal take shape for 170 North Green that would require non-workspace uses to be whittled down, the sources said. It could also be accelerated, should an office user sign on for some of the space within the building allotted to office by the plans, thus adding more momentum to the development team\u2019s search for financing. Some office tenants may prefer a building with an on-site hotel.\n\nThe 170 North Green site and Related Midwest\u2019s on Randolph Street previously made shifts away from hospitality in plans submitted to the city. Related in 2023 pivoted\n725 West Randolph\nfrom a mixed-use hotel-and-apartments project into office to compete for potentially lucrative tenants seeking upscale workspace in buzzy Fulton Market.\nSince developers received city approval in 2022 to build at 170 North Green, it has proven tricky to fund as construction loans got tougher to nail down when interest rates elevated. In 2023 they received city permission to remove the hotel element and replace it with an additional 65,000 square feet of office space, public records show. Now, they\u2019re again leaning into including lodging; they\u2019re approved for 150 hotel rooms in the property.\nThey also turned the vacant 62,000-square-foot lot \u2014 which previously contained the Bridgford Foods building that they\nbought for $60 million\nand later demolished \u2014 into pickleball courts while waiting to start construction on the permanent development.\nThe building is also approved to include 275 apartments, with 20 percent of them set aside for households making 60 percent or less of the area median income, as well as 350,000 square feet of office space, in addition to some retail. It\u2019s unclear whether a deal for the Global Ambassador, if finalized, would reduce the amount of space within the building planned for offices and apartments.\nShapack and CRG didn\u2019t return requests for comment, and neither did the Global Ambassador.\nSecuring the hospitality business could add some allure in their search for a construction lender. It\u2019s unclear if the project will also require an anchor office tenant to sign onto a lease in order to gain funding. The site is encumbered by a $31.3 million mortgage from Missouri-based Citizens Bank that was taken out by the developers to fund their purchase of the site in 2022. The developers\u2019 goal is to replace that debt with a construction loan.\nGlobal Ambassador was started by restaurateur Sam Fox, who opened his first property in Phoenix in late 2023 to critical acclaim, after about a decade of plotting and building the development. If its potential Chicago location is anywhere close to similar, expect it to be swanky: the Phoenix property contains five restaurants, a spa that offers cryotherapy and room rates for an early June stay start at just under $500 a night before taxes, with the 2,000-square-foot presidential suite available for about $3,400, the property\u2019s website said.\nShould CRG and Shapack Partners start construction at 170 North Green, it would be the second major Fulton Market project they\u2019ve kicked off in recent memory, after another joint venture of the firms landed an\n$84 million construction loan\nfor a 29-story, 308-unit apartment building at 220 North Ada Street last year. That project\u2019s total reported cost is $140 million.\n",

        "content": "The City of San Jose dished out sweeteners to attract developers for housing, and Hanover Company took the bait.\nThe city waived $4.9 million fees and taxes for the Houston-based developer to build a 345-unit apartment complex at 905 North Capitol Avenue, in north San Jose,\nthe San Jose Mercury News reported\n.\nWithout the waiver of in-lieu fees and 50 percent reduction of construction taxes\napproved by the city last year\n, the seven-story project would have never gotten off the ground, officials say.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great thing all around, but I think it comes with the recognition that we have to be able to right size our fees and processes and regulations and figure out how to be flexible and meet the market and allow that investment to flow,\u201d San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan told the newspaper.\nPlans by Hanover include 345 apartments, of which 328 units would be market-rate and 17 affordable for moderate-income households on a 2.1-acre site near the Penitencia Creek Light Rail Station. The building will contain 3,000 square feet of offices.\nScott Youdall, a regional development partner at Hanover, credited the city\u2019s program with helping move the project along after it was approved three years ago.\n\u201cWhen this project was originally entitled and approved, in the face of rising interest rates, we had not been able to get this project capitalized and started, but with the help of this incentive, we have been able to put the capitalization in place,\u201d Youdall told the Mercury News.\nRising interest rates and higher labor and material costs have curtailed office and market-rate projects over the past few years, leading San Jose to dangle more incentives.\n\nMarket conditions have especially hindered multifamily development.\nAfter averaging one new multifamily development per year, the city didn\u2019t see a single apartment project of more than 20 units break ground last year.\nTo help spur housing development, the city approved the new multifamily incentive program in December.\nThe initiative reduces park fees and a 50 percent cut in construction taxes for the first 1,500 units for projects in certain growth areas that applied by June 2022 and received building permits until the end of this year. A city analysis found that 35 projects qualified for incentives.\nHanover, founded by Murray Bowden in 1982, has developed multifamily residential and industrial properties in 12 states, including more than 56,000 apartments and $12 billion in project capitalization, according to its website.\nLast month, Hanover landed a\n$120.4 million construction financing\nto build 1,140 apartments\natop a historic persimmon orchard\nin north San Jose. It\u2019s not clear if the city incentives applied to plans to redevelop the Tsukuda Fruit Stand and orchard at 2620 Seely Avenue.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s no secret among San Francisco developers that landing a building permit can take years \u2014 making it the slowest city in the state to build anything.\nSupervisor Bilal Mahmood, who recently replaced antidevelopment Supervisor Dean Preston, has now called for a city investigation into what\u2019s taking so long to hand out permits,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported.\nMahmood planned to ask the supervisors\u2019 budget and legislative analyst this week to study the permitting process in five other cities across the state and compare them to San Francisco.\nThe study would look into the number and types of permits required by other major cities and counties that allow everything from small businesses and single-family homes to large housing projects to be built more quickly.\nIt would also analyze every step in San Francisco\u2019s permitting gauntlet, and the time it takes its various departments to spit out the permits. A timeline for the proposed study was not disclosed.\n\u201cThere are over 1,000 pages of San Francisco building code that have resulted in us being the slowest city to build in the entire state,\u201d Mahmood told the Chronicle. \u201cThere are other cities in the Bay Area and across California that are building faster than us with the same interest rates, the same labor conditions, the same costs.\u201d\nSan Francisco must permit 82,000 homes by 2031, more than half of them affordable, according to the state-mandated housing plan. The city is now rezoning much of the city to meet the goal.\n\nMahmood\u2019s request for a new study aims to support the goals of PermitSF, an initiative by Planning Director Rich Hillis and Mayor Daniel Lurie to reform the city\u2019s housing and small business permitting process.\n\u201cThis effort to learn from other cities who are building faster than us is consistent with the goals of PermitSF to deliver bold, transformative permitting solutions to accelerate the construction of much-needed housing in San Francisco,\u201d Hillis told the Chronicle.\nIt\u2019s not clear why it has taken San Francisco so long to evaluate its\nglacial permitting process\n.\nIn 2023, the city greenlit the building of 1,136 homes, a 13-year-low, according to figures from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. That compares to an average of 2,476 permits a year since 2001, with a peak 5,200 permits doled out in 2018, according to the San Francisco Business Times.\nA year earlier,\nThe Real Deal reported\nit took nearly 1,000 days on average -\u2013 450 days for entitlements and another 525 days for permitting \u2013\u2013 to get cleared to start a residential project in San Francisco, according to the state Department of Housing and Community Development.\nA\nSan Francisco Chronicle analysis\nfound it took the city an average 627 days to permit an apartment project, and 861 days to permit a single-family home.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "Gary Barnett\u2019s luxury project at 655 Madison Avenue is a ways away from reality, but he may have already found a retail tenant willing to pay big bucks to secure its space.\nLuxury fashion brand Chanel is in discussions to purchase the retail space at the Midtown Manhattan development, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. Chanel may pay in the mid-$400 millions for the 65,000 square feet at the corner of East 60th Street and Madison Avenue.\nThe deal, which has not been finalized, would give the brand space on the ground floor, as well as below street level and on higher floors. The blended price of a $450 million deal would break down to $7,000 per square foot.\nOutside of the large price tag, Extell Development could also benefit from the presence of Chanel as a means to help secure financing for the project.\nInsite Luxury Consulting\u2019s Paul Muratore is representing Chanel in the discussions.\n\nThe fashion brand previously negotiated for space across the street at 660 Madison Avenue, where it was willing to pay around $600 million. Those talks collapsed over a brokerage fee dispute. Chanel\u2019s presence in Midtown also includes a watch boutique at 730 Fifth Avenue and a fashion store at 15 East 57th Street.\nShould Chanel ultimately purchase the retail space, it would join a growing list of luxury retailers keen to own their own spaces in Manhattan.\nLast year, Kering \u2014 the French luxury group that owns Gucci, Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen \u2014 purchased the retail portion of 715-717 Fifth Avenue from Jeff Sutton and SL Green\nfor $963 million\n. Before that, Italy-based fashion brand Prada agreed to purchase 724 Fifth Avenue\nfor $425 million\n, also from Sutton.\nBarnett is\nplanning\na 193,000-square-foot building at 655 Madison Avenue that will include 62 residential units. Extell purchased the property in October for\nnearly $160 million\nfrom Williams Equities.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A Houston-based developer delivered a condo highrise, London House, with nearly all of its units already sold, proving that luxury can go vertical in sprawling Texas metros.\nRandall Davis Company\u2019s 12-story building at 2323 San Felipe Drive in River Oaks took two years to construct, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe 70,000-square-foot development has 23 units, including four penthouses. Prices range from $1.5 million to $3.8 million. Only two units are still available, according to company founder Randall Davis, who developed the project alongside his daughter, Natalie Davis.\nAll of the units have gas fireplaces, high-end appliances and cabinetry, 11- to 13-foot ceilings and customizable stone, porcelain and wood finishes. The building also includes a concierge-staffed lobby, resident lounge, dog run and pet-washing station. A four-story garage offers space for rent.\nA few luxury condo developers are catering to\ngrowing demand\nfor high-rise living across the Texas Triangle, where sprawl means luxury buyers have historically looked for luxury real estate with land.\n\nDavis is targeting buyers who are drawn to small buildings with top-notch amenities, he said.\nHis next project, The Chaucer, is also 12 stories, set to start construction soon at 2360 Rice Boulevard near Rice Village. The art deco-inspired development will have 29 units and span 75,000 square feet, with a third of units already pre-sold. The Chaucer will feature a brass-accented fa\u00e7ade, concierge-staffed lobby, dog park and storage.\nThe highest tier of the luxury market in Houston has shown resilience, with home sales over $10 million surging by 75 percent to seven million homes in 2023. Affluent neighborhoods like River Oaks and Memorial lead the market for most-expensive home sales. However, the overall luxury segment has faced challenges, with fewer high-end listings compared to previous years, and competition from Dallas, which outpaces other Texas metros at the highest pricing tier.\nOther luxury condos under construction in Houston include the St. Regis Residences, a 35-story development set to begin construction next year in the Upper Kirby district. The Ritz-Carlton Residences in the Woodlands will offer 111 units designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

        "content": "BH Group and Prime Group can charge ahead with plans for a Homewood Suites By Hilton hotel near Gulfstream Park, as South Florida\u2019s hospitality sector expects growing demand this year.\nOn Wednesday, the\nHallandale Beach\nCity Commission by a unanimous 7-0 vote approved a site plan for the joint venture\u2019s\n15-story project\nwith 246 rooms and 281 parking spaces at 804 South Federal Highway. The partnership can now move on to the permitting and groundbreaking phases.\nAventura-based\nBH\nis led by Isaac and Liat Toledano, and Hollywood-based Prime is led by Larry Abbo. Designed by Hollywood-based Prime Design Associates, the hotel would also have a ground-floor cafe, restaurant and an enclosed public plaza.\n\nThe city commission also approved a mechanical parking lift for 40 valet spaces and agreed to increase the height of the building by one story because the development site is capped at 14 stories.\nIn the tri-county region, hotel landlords can expect a rise in room rates and revenue in the coming months, according to a recent CBRE report. In Broward County, the average revenue per room is expected to grow by 2.4 percent, and the average daily rate is projected to increase by 1.4 percent in 2025, the report states.\nBut only a few projects, including the BH and Prime Hilton-branded hotel, are slated for construction this year, CBRE found. High financing and construction costs are limiting new hotel development. Potential additional tariffs, labor shortages or the Fed pulling back on further interest rate reductions could further slow hospitality construction.\nBH and Prime paid $6.5 million for the 0.8-acre vacant property in May. The joint venture abandoned a previous site plan to develop a\n14-story building\nwith 138 condo-hotel units, 60 hotel rooms and 4,000 square feet of retail space.\u00a0The hotel development site is near the\nSeville Mobile Home Park\nthat\u2019s been targeted for redevelopment. Property owner Seville General Partners, led by Paul Rosen, is seeking city approval to rezone the 7-acre property at 426 Northeast Fifth Street and 515 North Federal Highway to allow six mid-rise buildings offering a mix of retail and offices.",

An officer had allegedly gotten out of his vehicle to try to de-escalate the situation with Conover but was instead struck by the car and thrown 40 feet.\nThe officer, Cameron Emmett, was taken to the hospital for a leg injury and has since been released.\nConover denied the allegations at his arraignment and accused officers of lying about the incident.\n\u201cI have everything right here, and it\u2019s all falsified,\u201d Conover said. \u201cIf anyone dares try to test my mental competence, I will eviscerate every single person with my intelligence right now.\u201d\n\nConover runs a YouTube channel with nearly 3 million subscribers, which showcases ultra-luxury listings across New York City, Aspen and Miami, among others.\nConover, who launched his internet fame as a travel vlogger,\nventured into real estate\nafter collaborating on a listing video with Ryan Serhant in 2018. After obtaining his real estate license two years later, he joined Nest Seekers and was handed $100 million in listings from the firm\u2019s CEO, Eddie Shapiro.\nConover appears to be no longer licensed with Nest Seekers. His page has been removed from the company\u2019s website, and the New York Department of State doesn\u2019t have a record of his license.\nThe judge ordered Conover remain in jail until at least his probable cause hearing, which is slated for this week. Police also said Conover was arrested the Wednesday prior to the incident on a drunk driving charge, though Conover claimed he\u2019s been sober for roughly four years.\n\u2014 Sheridan Wall\n",

The four cases pertain to loans with an aggregate original principal stretching beyond $600 million.\nThe action is connected to more than half of Pinnacle\u2019s multifamily portfolio in New York City, roughly 5,200 units of the 8,700-unit portfolio. Two dozen Manhattan properties are linked to the litigation, as well as approximately 75 properties in the outer boroughs. The largest of the loans covers a 142-unit building at 25 Hillside Avenue in Manhattan\u2019s Washington Heights.\nAt this stage, the action only involves summonses, not complaints, which is an oddity for commercial foreclosure cases in the state. It\u2019s unclear why Flagstar did not file complaints in its action.\nPinnacle could not be reached for comment by\nThe Real Deal\n.\n\nEarlier this year, Flagstar \u2014 the rebranded New York Community Bank \u2014\noffloaded\n$142 million in rent-stabilized debt to Cantor Fitzgerald. The loans were backed by 27 assets, which were 86 percent rent-stabilized on a weighted average, according to an analysis by\nThe Real Deal\n. The portfolio featured both performing and non-performing loans from borrowers, including Steve Croman, Alma Realty, Fairstead and none other than Pinnacle Group.\nPinnacle\u2019s portfolio spans approximately 136 properties totaling about 7.5 million square feet, according to PincusCo data, which estimates the holdings are worth about $1.6 billion.\nIn 2022, the billionaire Wiener was penalized after he admitted to not properly acknowledging needed capital repairs at a Forest Hills condo conversion. Under a\nsettlement\n, Wiener paid $330,000 to the reserve fund of The Georgian at 109-20 Queens Boulevard, which covered the cost of the needed piping, as well as $150,000 to the HPD.\nWiener reached\nbillionaire status in 2017\n, despite once being a target of tenant complaints and fraud investigations.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A lender is allegedly refusing to take back the keys of a rent-regulated building in Harlem, showing how low that corner of New York\u2019s multifamily sector has sunk.\nL+M Development Partners is suing Santander Bank for declining the deed in lieu of foreclosure at 320 St. Nicholas Avenue, Bisnow\nreported\n. The landlord filed the complaint in New York County Supreme Court last week.\nThe complaint was first reported by\nPincusCo\n. Both companies declined to comment to Bisnow on the legal dispute.\nLisa Gomez\u2019s L+M argues that the loan documents for the building give it the right to walk away from the property.\nLegislation directly impacted the property and its future.\nThe loan dates back to 2019 when Signature Bank originated $12 million to finance the conversion of four rent-regulated units into 12 apartments. But in 2023, New York amended the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, removing landlords\u2019 ability to\ngenerate new first rent\non reconfigured apartments.\nThe owner stopped work on the property after the amendments were passed, L+M claims, and began warehousing the apartments \u2014 removing them from the market \u2014 arguing its renovations were no longer legal.\n\nSantander entered the picture in 2023 when it\nbought a 20 percent stake\nin the failed Signature\u2019s loan book, which was backed by both rent-stabilized and rent-controlled properties. The FDIC chose Santander to manage the debt, yet it doesn\u2019t appear to be working with its borrower.\nIn June, it informed L+M of the default in Harlem and demanded payment. Three months later, L+M offered to turn over the property\u2019s deed.\nSantander told L+M that the loan documents don\u2019t require the bank to accept in deed-in-lieu, according to the complaint. L+M argued the process was implicit in the loan.\nIn January, Santander sent a default notice to L+M claiming the loan is recourse to the borrower; mortgage agreement documents appear to show the opposite. There is a \u201cbad boy guarantee,\u201d which states the bank can go after other assets under specific conditions, including fraud, misconduct, abandonment and physical waste.\nThat appears to be exactly what Santander is trying to do, likely hoping to collect assets that are worth more than the relatively small 320 St. Nicholas.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The total was down from\n26 in the previous period\nand\nchilled from a busy period\nthat kicked off March for the market.\nThe priciest contract last week went to 17 Willow Place in Brooklyn Heights, asking $10 million, or $2,173 per square foot.\nThe 4,600-square-foot home was designed by Robert Kahn and completed in 2012 with east-west exposures that include a two-story window that looks out onto a private garden. The 25-foot-wide home has four bedrooms and three bathrooms.\nOnly the facade and sidewalls remain from the 19th-century stable that used to occupy the 100-foot lot, and a curved staircase connects the three floors. The double-height living room has a wood-burning fireplace, while the primary bedroom has a gas fireplace.\nBrown Harris Stevens\u2019 Joan Goldberg had the listing.\n\nThe second most expensive contract last week went to 218 North Fifth Street in Williamsburg, which asked $7.25 million or $1,588 per square foot. It was originally listed for almost $8 million last June before landing at its current asking price in August.\nSpanning over 4,500 square feet, it is the largest home ever sold in North Williamsburg, according to Compass Todd Lewin, who along with Michael Rubin of the Lewis and Rubin Team, had the listing.\nThe newly built corner-lot home was completed in 2013 by the current owners and put on the market for the first time last summer.\nThe four-bedroom, three-bathroom home has space for four cars across two garages, four bedrooms and four outdoor spaces totaling 1,530 square feet. It also features a wood-burning fireplace, and polished concrete and white oak flooring.\nThe total contract volume last week was almost $70 million, with a median asking price of $3.1 million and an average price per square foot of $1,640. During the same week last year, the total contract volume was $56.5 million with a median asking price of $2.75 million and an average price per square foot of $1,366.\n",

        "content": "In this contentious time, let us all come together in our hatred of sidewalk sheds.\nThe general consensus, for years, has been that sidewalk sheds are ugly, stick around for too long and, in the worst cases, can themselves be unsafe.\nThe City Council on Wednesday is expected to vote on a\npackage of bills\naimed at reducing the miles of sidewalk sheds (and the scaffolding above them) that crowd NYC streets. Last year, the Council held a hearing on more than a dozen shed-related bills. The package being voted on this week includes five measures.\nHere is a rundown of the bills coming up for a vote:\n\u2014\u00a0One of the\nmeasures\ndecreases the length of a shed permit issued for fa\u00e7ade repairs, from one year to three months. It also creates penalties that kick in when an owner renews a permit for the second time but work on the fa\u00e7ade is not progressing. The latest version of this bill seems to address a concern raised by the Real Estate Board of New York, which requested that owners be given the opportunity to show what is going on with their site. Owners must submit a report to the Department of Buildings explaining why work has stalled (be it a financial reason, inability to access a neighboring property, etc.) to avoid penalties.\n\u2014 Another\nbill\nbumps the first required fa\u00e7ade inspection for newly-constructed buildings from five years post-completion to eight. It also requires the DOB to complete a study and come up with recommendations to change the city\u2019s Fa\u00e7ade Inspection &amp; Safety Program, or FISP. Specifically, the measure calls on the DOB to increase the time between fa\u00e7ade inspections from five years to sometime between six and 12 years. DOB must provide a recommendation by the end of the year, and the changes would go into effect on October 1, 2026. (Last year, DOB Commissioner James Oddo indicated that his agency had already hired a firm to study FISP and make recommendations).\n\u2014 Hunter green is so 2013. One of the bills requires the DOB to study and recommend new sidewalk shed designs by Sept. 30. The bill also expands the permitted color palette for sheds, adding metallic gray, white or \u201ca color matching the fa\u00e7ade, trim, cornice, or roof of the building.\u201d\n\u2014Those three bills are sponsored by Council member Keith Powers. Another bill, sponsored by Erik Bottcher, would ramp up penalties for fa\u00e7ade work that is not completed in a timely manner. For example, owners who fail to file a permit application for fa\u00e7ade work within eight months of receiving a shed permit will face penalties between $5,000 and $20,000. The latest version of the bill allows owners to plead their case to the DOB to explain why they need more time to complete repairs. A second bill sponsored by Bottcher requires more lighting under sidewalk sheds.\nSome of these bills overlap with ongoing efforts by the Adams administration, which launched the \u201cGet Sheds Down\u201d initiative in 2023. Last year, the mayor announced that the initiative had resulted in the removal of 173 miles of sidewalk sheds in the city. The administration also tapped two firms, ARUP and PAU, to come up with six new designs for the sheds.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: The\nstate budget\nis due in one week. What policies are you hoping will make it into the budget? Which ones are you dreading? Is there something you think deserves more attention? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nThe New York Housing Conference\nestimates\nthat the city will build 15,750 fewer housing units over the next 10 years, compared to average production in recent years. The group is basing its analysis on the Preliminary Ten-Year Capital Plan, which shows capital funding for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development go from $3.6 billion this fiscal year, to $3.3 million next year and down to $2 billion or less each year between fiscal years 2027 and 2035. The group warns that such drops in funding will mean that the $2 billion in state and city funding dedicated to City of Yes for Housing Opportunity will \u201cplug budget holes rather than support additional needs.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 ICYMI: Mayor Eric Adams tapped Randy Mastro to be his new First Deputy Mayor, replacing Maria Torres-Springer,\nthe New York Times reports\n. Back in July, the mayor nominated Mastro to be corporation counsel, but Mastro withdrew his name from consideration when it became clear that the City Council would not approve his appointment.\n\u2014 In February, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that she was going to increase oversight of Mayor Eric Adams, but those efforts have stalled out,\nPolitico New York reports\n. The City Council would need to approve the governor\u2019s plan before it heads to the state legislature. \u201cWe had a preliminary conversation a few weeks ago and there were a lot of questions and concerns raised by Council members that I think will need to be worked through before we have a package that is ready for prime time,\u201d said Brooklyn Democrat Lincoln Restler, who chairs the Committee on Governmental Operations, told Politico.\n\u2014 Assembly member Zohran Mamdani doesn\u2019t want your money. That\u2019s because he raised more than $8 million, hitting the fundraising cap for his run for mayor,\nGothamist reports\n.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Monday was\n$14.7 million\nfor a condo unit at 151 East 58th Street in Midtown East. The One Beacon Court unit is 4,500 square feet and last sold on the market in 2005 for $13.2 million.\nSerhant\u2019s\nAlen Moshkovich had the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$10.8 million\nfor\n151 Avenue A in the East Village. The rental building is 9,600 square feet, five stories and has eight units.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $17 million for a co-op unit at 1020 Fifth Avenue. The Upper East Side co-op has four beds and four bathrooms and was listed by Compass\u2019s Eric Brown and Zeve Salman of the\nElevated Team\n.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

That\u2019s evident by the relatively low vacancy rate on the stretch above Grand Central Terminal, despite high asking rents in the area.\nThe vacancy rate on Park Avenue is down to 8.9 percent, according to CoStar, representing a seven-year low for the avenue. That\u2019s practically half the vacancy rate of Manhattan as a whole, which stands at 16.1 percent.\nJust a few boulevards away, however, landlords are offering discounts of 75 percent compared to the going rates of Park Avenue, and yet are still struggling to fill spaces.\nCompanies are willing to shell out big bucks on Park Avenue. Tenants such as law firms, real estate companies, insurers and money managers continue to flock to Park Avenue.\n\nBeyond being associated with Manhattan prestige, Park Avenue\u2019s attractiveness surged upon the completion of the Long Island Rail Road extension to Grand Central, making it even easier for Long Island commuters to get to 42nd Street and above.\nAdditionally, Park Avenue is attracting businesses that jumped to Hudson Yards in recent years. At least three tenants have moved from Hudson Yards to Park Avenue since the pandemic, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield.\nThere are more office developments on the way. JPMorgan Chase\nplans to open\nits $3 billion office at 270 Park Avenue this summer. RXR and TF Cornerstone are\nseeking financing\nfor 175 Park Avenue, which is expected to be the tallest commercial building in the Western Hemisphere upon completion.\nAnd last week, the 1.8-million-square-foot project at 350 Park Avenue, spearheaded by Vornado Realty Trust and Ken Griffin, became the\nfirst office tower presented\nto the City Planning Commission in five years.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The apartment features a private foyer, eat-in kitchen and a sprawling primary suite.\nExtell Marketing Group and a team from Corcoran Sunshine \u2013 led by Kane Manera, Janet Wang, Tim Rizzo and Gabriele Tonini \u2014 are heading sales at the Billionaires\u2019 Row tower.\nThe skyscraper, marketed as the tallest residential building in the world, has seen several of its units close for significant discounts compared to its initial offering plan. But the property has still logged a number of hefty sales, including a\n$115 million\ndeal last summer for a duplex penthouse.\nSince sales launched in 2022, 72 of the tower\u2019s 180 units have sold for an average of $4,600 per square foot.\nThe Central Park Tower apartment was one of 31 properties in the borough asking $4 million or more to land inked deals, down from 36 in the\nprevious period\n. Twenty-five of those homes were condos, four were co-ops and two were townhouses.\n\nAbout half of the condos were sponsor units, with last asking prices discounted an average of 20 percent from the originals and were on the market for almost five years.\nThe second most expensive home to enter contract was the 46th floor at 111 West 57th Street, with an asking price of $23.8 million. The apartment spans 4,500 square feet and has three bedrooms and three bathrooms.\nThe condo, which last traded for close to $27 million, hit the market in September for $24.5 million. It features a great room with 14-foot ceilings and views of Central Park.\nCompass\u2019 Jim St. Andre, Trevor Stephens and Michael Maniawski had the listing.\nAmenities in the building, developed by JDS Development, Property Markets Group and Apollo, include a fitness center, lap pool and private dining room.\nThe homes\u2019 combined asking price was $267 million, for an average price of $8.6 million and a median of $6 million. The typical home spent more than 970 days on the market and was discounted 15 percent from the original listing price.\nThe priciest homes to hit the market last week were a five-bedroom penthouse at 832 Park Avenue, asking just under $30 million, and Unit 66B at 432 Park Avenue, asking $29.5 million, according to the Eklund-Gomes team\u2019s weekly report.\n",

        "content": "A closer look at a rent-control drama in Washington Heights reveals the landlord is not shaking down a little old lady to \u201cmaximize profits\u201d but struggling to reduce losses and stave off foreclosure.\nThe legal battle between 78-year-old tenant Freda Henderson and landlord Westside Ventura II LLC, which property records indicate is controlled by Joseph Sbiroli, was written up by\nGothamist\nas a tale of good versus evil.\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s\nfollow-up\npresented a more complex view of the situation. It turns out there\u2019s even more to the story.\nHenderson\u2019s lawyer\u2019s claim that the landlord is seeking to \u201cmaximize profits\u201d by evicting her reflects the common assumption that landlords always make a profit \u2014 the only question being how big. But at rent-regulated buildings, owners are increasingly trying to minimize losses and keep lenders from forcing a sale.\nThat appears to be the case at 547 West 157th Street, where Henderson is claiming succession rights to a $640-a-month, rent-controlled lease held by her boyfriend, who died at least a decade ago. If she loses, the unit would become rent-stabilized and could fetch more than $2,000 a month.\nBut that wouldn\u2019t come close to salvaging the building\u2019s finances.\nAll 42 units in the building are rent-regulated,\ncity records show\n. It was\npurchased for $14.65 million\nin 2016, three years before a\nnew state law\ndevalued\nrent-regulated buildings. The price \u2014 a huge win for seller\nLazer Sternhell\n\u2014 worked out to $349,000 per unit.\n\nIn 2023, total rent revenue was $931,000, according to records from its tax assessment challenge. That\u2019s $1,850 per unit, per month. Operating costs were $687,000 and property taxes were $145,000. Subtract those expenses from revenue, and you get $98,000.\nThat\u2019s a tiny number for a 42-unit building, and it\u2019s not even profit. To find that, we must subtract interest payments on the\n$6 million mortgage\nfrom Chase Bank \u2014 about $275,000, based on rates when the loan was issued in May 2020.\nSo the building lost about $177,000 for the year. The owner spent $169,000 on repairs and maintenance, and records show a substantial reduction in\nbuilding violations\n. But with lead paint and other issues still to be addressed, it\u2019s hard to imagine the cost of maintaining this old building will go down in years to come. And interest rates have gone up several points.\nWhat is the path forward for a rent-stabilized building like 547 West 157th Street?\nBased on the net operating income and a 5 percent cap rate, one source put the property\u2019s value at roughly $2 million. In that case, refinancing the $6 million mortgage, which likely comes due in the next year or two, would require the owner to kick in $4 million.\nIt\u2019s hard to see how that would make sense for an asset that is losing money, especially when the state legislature shows no sign of changing the 2019 Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act.\nWhether you side with Henderson in her quest to keep paying $640 a month for her two-bedroom or the landlord, \u201cmaximizing profits\u201d has no place in the discussion. There are no profits to maximize at 547 West 157th Street.\n",

        "content": "Remember those probes into city office leases?\nIn November, City Hall\npaused\nplans to move the Department of Aging to 14 Wall Street, following reports that the Department of Citywide Administrative Services\u2019 Jesse Hamilton pushed for the building, owned by a donor to Mayor Eric Adams, to be selected. At the time, then-First Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer indicated that she was reviewing that and other city office leases.\nBut much has changed since then \u2014\u00a0the mayor is poised to escape federal corruption charges and his administration has lost several leaders. Torres-Springer left last week, and there\u2019s been no word on that lease nor various investigations into city office leases.\nDuring a budget hearing on Friday, Council member Lincoln Restler asked DCAS Commissioner Louis Molina about the status of the City Hall probe. Molina said that the Mayor\u2019s Office of Risk Management reviewed the lease at 14 Wall Street and indicated that a decision on that lease is expected soon. As for the broader City Hall review, he directed Restler to City Hall. (A spokesperson told me that they didn\u2019t have an update.)\nMolina also said that DCAS is doing an internal review of asset management overall.\nThe commissioner said that his agency is still preparing a request for proposals to hire five commercial brokerages to\nrepresent the city\non its office leases. That\u2019s up from the two, Cushman &amp; Wakefield and CBRE, that the city currently works with.\nHe said the process is taking longer than initially anticipated because there were aspects of the leasing process, illustrated in part by the experience with 14 Wall Street, that Molina wants to strengthen. He said the RFP is under legal review.\nThen the conversation turned to broker Diana Boutross, the broker whose phone was\nreportedly seized\nby the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office as part of an investigation into city leases.\nRestler asked if Boutross was still the lead on Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s contract with the city and if DCAS had looked into her work on city leases, citing her \u201cglaring lack of qualifications\u201d related to office leasing. Molina confirmed that she is still on the team but noted that there are other brokers who also work on the city\u2019s contract. He said DCAS has not scrutinized her work on city leases but also disagreed with Restler\u2019s comment about her qualifications.\nHamilton has stayed out of the limelight. He wasn\u2019t at the Friday hearing (Molina said Hamilton had a medical issue).\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: During the budget hearing, Molina said the city is on track to cut building emissions 40 percent by fiscal year 2027 (after missing its\ninitial target\n) and then 50 percent by 2030. Restler expressed concern that the city may not reach those goals, given that the city has only reduced emissions by 26 percent so far. He said the city needs to lead by example as private building owners face a May deadline to submit reports showing that their buildings\u2019 emissions comply with Local Law 97. Will the city meet its own emission targets?

Chesterton\u2019s Catholic priest-turned-amateur detective, Father Brown, Levinson and Link wrote in their book, \u201cStay Tuned: An Inside Look at the Making of Prime Time Television.\u201d Thank you to my husband, who is reading \u201cCrime and Punishment\u201d for the first time and somehow made this connection before I did. As someone with great love for \u201cColumbo\u201d and \u201cCrime and Punishment,\u201d I found his discovery delightful and infuriating.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 A federal judge on Thursday dealt another blow to the nonprofit fighting to hold onto the Elizabeth Street Garden. The judge rejected the nonprofit\u2019s request to issue a preliminary injunction to block the city from moving forward with evicting the garden. The group, which is also called Elizabeth Street Garden, said it is filing an appeal of that decision. The city plans to build more than 100 units of senior housing on the site.\n\u2014 Bottem Realty has agreed to pay $403,000 to resolve penalties for failing to register rent-stabilized units and overcharging tenants, according to the state Department of Homes and Community Renewal. The agency issued the penalties after auditing Bottem\u2019s rent-regulated portfolio, which includes 266 apartments across seven buildings in Brooklyn and the Bronx.\n\u2014 Amy Schumer is selling the \u201cMoonstruck\u201d house. Two years after buying 19 Cranberry Street in Brooklyn Heights, the townhouse featured in the 1987 film starring Cher and Nicholas Cage, Schumer has listed it for $14 million,\nCurbed reports\n.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Friday was for a condo unit for\n$10 million\nat 108 Leonard Street. The Tribeca condo is 3,700 square feet and is a new development.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s\nElena Sarkissian, Raphael De Niro, Christopher Salierno, Matthew Mackay and Jane Powers have the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$5 million\nfor 204-06 East 58th Street. The Midtown East, mixed-use building is four stories and has 9,800 square feet of floor area.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $30 million for a condo unit at 823 Park Avenue. The penthouse is 7,200 square feet and last sold on the market in 2008 for $30.5 million.\nCompass\u2019\nMaria Manuche, Clare Cukier and Michelle Flikerski have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 195,636-square-foot, eight-story affordable housing building with a community facility at 570 Eldert Lane in Brooklyn.

        "content": "For a few noteworthy Upper East Side properties, years on the market are turning into signed contracts.\nA pet entrepreneur\u2019s Fifth Avenue condo\nfinally found a buyer\nlast week after seven years of on-and-off shopping. The sixth-floor apartment topped Manhattan\u2019s luxury market, per Olshan Realty\u2019s weekly report, with an asking price of around $25 million.\nWhy now? Appraiser Jonathan Miller said buyers are making moves this year despite some uncertainty in the market.\nAlso, a $17 million price cut from its initial ask doesn\u2019t hurt.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing better pricing coming into the market as a general rule,\u201d said appraiser Jonathan Miller. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you most of those properties that have started to sell have had price reductions.\u201d\nAllen Simon, the inventor of the Wee Wee pad, and his wife, Cynthia Simon, bought the apartment at 838 Fifth Avenue for $11 million about 25 years ago. The couple has tried to sell their three-bedroom unit since 2018, first for $42 million, then $40 million, then $27 million before settling on $24.5 million.\nThe condo traded about a month after a Gilded Age mansion roughly 10 blocks up\nlanded an inked deal\nafter four years on and off the market. The sprawling home at 973 Fifth Avenue, which last traded for $42 million in 2012, once asked an eye-popping $80 million.\nBut it only snagged a buyer after dropping the price to just under $50 million.\n\u201cBuyers are much more sort of handcuffed,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the flexibility, so there\u2019s less tolerance for pie-in-the-sky valuation.\u201d\nWeeks after the townhouse entered contract, another historic Upper East Side home, known as the Woolworth Mansion,\nlowered its price\nfrom $60 million to $50 million. The listing broker, Adam Modlin, brought the buyer to the 973 Fifth Avenue purchase.\nIf sellers\u2019 latest moves are any indication, the neighborhood could start seeing more of its long-listed trophy properties in the hands of new owners.\n\n\u201c[Sellers] are just getting back in line with what market conditions actually are,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd when they\u2019re in line with market conditions, they\u2019re actually selling.\u201d\nNot so fast\u2026\nThe residential market is still moving though brokers say uncertainty and volatility are likely on the horizon.\nAcross the country, home sales\nrose 4 percent\nfrom January to February, though transactions were down slightly from the same period last year, according to the National Association of Realtors\u2019 monthly report.\nIn New York, new signed contracts rose again last month across Manhattan and Brooklyn, along with new listings hitting the market, according to Miller Samuel\u2019s monthly report. In Brooklyn, pending deals increased particularly in the luxury segment, defined as $2 million, compared to the overall market.\nIf listings continue to grow in each of the boroughs, deals are expected to continue to trend upward and restore a healthy pace of home sales to a market that was sluggish through 2023 and the beginning of 2024.\n\u201cThe way I\u2019ve described 2025 is getting back to zero,\u201d Miller said.\nWhile agents have warned about hesitancy in the market with an ever-changing policy landscape, the spring season is likely to boost activity.\n\u201cApril is really where things really take off,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThe uncertainty that we\u2019ve seen with tariff policy is not really causing the market to hold back yet. The volatility in the stock market doesn\u2019t seem to be holding things back.\u201d\nNYC Deal of the Week\nAn apartment at Witkoff Group\u2019s 150 Charles Street set a new record for Downtown Manhattan when it closed for\n$60 million\nearlier this week. The deal \u2014 the priciest to land in the city register \u2014 was double what the sellers, financier Harsh Padia and his wife, interior designer Purvi Padi, paid for it in 2016. The duplex has five bedrooms, five bathrooms and a sprawling terrace overlooking the Hudson River.\n",

Affordable housing in New York continues to be hard to come by.\nLast year, NYCHA selected 200,000 Section 8 tenants by lottery to be awarded Housing Choice Vouchers. Nine months after the application window closed, NYCHA worked its way through 12,000 applications; of those, only 318 succeeded in obtaining affordable housing through the program.\n\nIn a city with nearly six million renters, 318 is the statistical equivalent of zero,\nwrites columnist Erik Engquist\n.\nAlthough the Housing Choice Vouchers may not be much of a lifeline these days, the office market received a big one recently. A trio of Midtown office buildings\nscored 10-figure CMBS deals\nin February, a sign of post-pandemic recovery for trophy commercial properties.\nIrvine Company\u2019s MetLife Building landed the largest CMBS deal of the three, a $1.5 billion loan issued by Bank of America and Wells Fargo. Aby Rosen\u2019s RFR Holding scored a $1.2 billion refinancing of the Seagram Building, while Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge\u2019s trophy office tower at\n3 Bryant Park\ngrabbed a massive $1.1 billion CMBS loan.\nOn the crime beat, a federal judge in New Jersey sentenced Moshe Silber\nto 30 months\nin prison for his involvement in a broad mortgage fraud scandal, sparing him the maximum sentence. He faced up to five years after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mortgage fraud in 2024.\nMeanwhile, four individuals \u2014 including one real estate agent \u2014 were\nindicted\nfor allegedly stealing three homes in Queens through a deed fraud scheme involving falsified documents.

        "content": "After a year and a half on the market, the late Mary Tyler Moore\u2019s Greenwich estate may finally be sold.\nThe actress\u2019 widower, retired cardiologist Robert Levine, agreed to sell the property at 50 Dingletown Road, the New York Post\nreported\n. While the deal is in contract, a sale of the lavish Connecticut home has not been finalized.\nThe potential purchase price and buyer\u2019s identity were not reported.\nLevine listed the 14,000-square-foot property in September 2023 for\n$21.9 million\nbut slashed the asking price on the home multiple times. Last April, Levine dropped the ask to $18.9 million. In July, he dropped it even further to $16.9 million, the asking price when the home went into contract.\nAt the final asking price, the deal would break down to $1,207 per square foot.\nThe couple purchased the seven-acre estate for roughly $10 million in 2006. Moore, known for starring on \u201cThe Dick Van Dyke Show\u201d and \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show,\u201d died in 2017; Levine decided to sell as part of the moving on process after his wife\u2019s death.\n\nThey tore down the Georgian-style house \u2014 with the exception of the front facade \u2014 and spent three years doubling the size of the property. The entryway has a curved staircase and harlequin-patterned floors, and a wall of windows to look out on the garden and a skylight. The primary suite, meanwhile, is in its own wing, featuring dual dressing rooms, including a closet with 100 linear feet of hanging space.\nThe property also has a spa with a massage room, hot tub and sauna, a gym with a ballet barre, a solarium, a billiards room and an outdoor pool.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Joseph Barbieri has the\nlisting\n.\nLevine previously said a portion of proceeds from the sale will go towards the Mary Tyler Moore Vision Initiative, which aims to preserve and restore vision for those with diabetes; Moore was diagnosed with diabetes in 1969.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Joseph Safdie bought a Gowanus development site a little over a year ago, betting on a replacement for the expired 421a tax abatement.\nThe bet seemed to pay off in April when the state passed a revamped version called\n485x\n. But it had deeper affordability requirements than 421a, and a higher wage scale for workers depending on location and project size.\nSafdie grabbed his pencil and started calculating construction costs for his property on the corner of Fourth Avenue and 14th Street.\n\u201cNormally, the density for such a site would be 140 apartments or so,\u201d said Safdie, chief executive of JSAF Capital Holdings. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t pencil out, given that if you add an extra 20 to 30 units your cost of construction goes up dramatically.\u201d\nSafdie scaled back the number of apartments to 99 to avoid the $40 wage floor that kicks in at 100 units. He isn\u2019t the only one who has drawn that conclusion.\nSeventeen new building permits for projects with exactly 99 units have been filed since January, when 485x went into effect. Those include several projects where developers subdivided large properties into multiple 99-unit projects. By some estimates, construction costs for buildings with more than 100 units are up 15 to 25 percent under the new program.\nThat\u2019s motivating many developers to weigh the cost of subdividing large lots.\n\u201cEvery large site that I have where rental housing is the highest and best use, developers are spending more time trying to figure out how to subdivide the site to create pads on which they could build 99-unit buildings than thinking about anything else,\u201d said BKREA\u2019s Bob Knakal, adding that the cost of multiple building cores, heating plants, roofs and other infrastructure, still pencils out to less.\nKnakal is marketing a\nlarge development\nsite in East Harlem owned by the Durst Organization, where buyers are exploring that strategy. Nearby, Cheskel Schwimmer\u2019s Chess Builders filed plans for two adjacent 99-unit buildings on the\nUpper East Side\n.\n\nIn Brooklyn, developer\nYitzchok Katz\nof Goose Property Management has filed three new building plans for 99-unit buildings at a Boerum Hill development site he bought in April. And the\nJay Group\nfiled plans for 450 units in Downtown Brooklyn, spread among five buildings, in an apparent nod to the 485x wage requirement.\n\u201cIt has had the opposite effect of trying to get better wages for construction workers \u2014 in some cases $40 minimum wage an hour, in some cases $72 minimum wage per hour,\u201d Knakal said, referencing the higher wage floor for projects with more than 150 units in some parts of the city. \u201cMake it $472 an hour. What\u2019s the difference? No one\u2019s getting those jobs anyway.\u201d\nLaborers unions that lobbied for the wage floor argue that large affordable housing developments have been built in the South Bronx, East Harlem and Brownsville in recent years with a $40 per hour wage standard after the construction unions\nreached deals\nwith individual developers.\n\u201cThese projects clearly show that construction laborers can be paid a $40 per hour wage while increasing the supply of affordable housing in our city,\u201d said Mike Prohaska of Laborers\u2019 Local 79.\nGary LaBarbera, president of the Building &amp; Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, said, \u201cIt is clear that these developers [building 99 units] are trying to unashamedly circumvent the law to avoid paying hard-working New Yorkers the fair and family-sustaining wages they deserve.\u201d\nBut developers also need construction loans, and lenders might deem projects with more than 99 units too risky.\n\u201cIf we were concerned about it, then I\u2019m sure the bank would be concerned about it,\u201d Safdie said. \u201cWe\u2019re only going to do a project that makes sense on our level, and we know what the banks will lend.\u201d\nA few developers will still opt for rentals with more than 100 units \u2014 if they bought their land cheap, have held it for a while and prefer the steady income of rentals over condo development, said Mark Willis of the NYU Furman Center. But the 485x program makes most of those larger projects apparently unworkable.\n\u201cDevelopers are dividing lots up, and it\u2019s all about the higher labor costs for bigger buildings,\u201d Willis said. \u201cThe resulting proliferation of separate structures with more lobbies and elevator banks and, in some cases, less units makes you wonder if 485x has ended up impairing the goal of expanding the supply of housing \u2014 and of affordable housing, in particular.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Marcy Javor is among a handful of top real estate agents who deal in one of Boca Raton\u2019s most expensive communities, the\nRoyal Palm Yacht &amp; Country Club\n.\nJavor promotes herself as part of the leading half percent of agents in the country, declaring that she\u2019s closed more than $1.6 billion in sales.\n\u201cLuxury real estate moves fast, and having the right agent makes all the difference,\u201d she wrote in a recent post on social media.\nBut Javor, who hangs her license with\nBoca Raton\n-based Signature One Luxury Estates, is accused of behavior associated with another type of real estate agent.\nJavor is tied up in litigation with former clients and is under investigation by the state. She is accused of misrepresenting herself as a broker, failing to disclose material changes to agreements with clients, lying about having buyers at the ready, and publishing misleading and inaccurate information about properties, court filings allege.\nThey are allegations that she disputes.\nIt all points to ongoing issues that buyers, sellers and agents have to handle on their own because the industry is under-regulated, experts say. It\u2019s especially true in Florida, where more than 320,000 brokers and real estate agents are licensed, outnumbering attorneys four to one.\nJavor is fighting back. Last year, Signature One Luxury Estates sued a former client, Arnold Galman, as part of a lawsuit that included Boca Raton\u2019s top broker,\nDavid Roberts\nand his Royal Palm Properties. (Roberts and Royal Palm are no longer parties in the complaint.) Two months later, in July, Javor filed a defamation lawsuit against Galman.\nFrom futures to real estate\nJavor has been a licensed real estate agent in Florida for about a decade, after she exited the futures industry in 2015.\nIn her application with the state to become a real estate agent, she allegedly failed to disclose that in her prior career as a commodities broker, she had been\nforced to withdraw\nfrom the National Futures Association and was ordered not to register as an associated person or principal of an NFA member for a period of four years.\nThe NFA found that Javor and her companies made misleading sales solicitations and provided false information, violating the NFA\u2019s compliance rules.\nJavor said in a statement to\nThe Real Deal\nthat she had already planned to leave the business before that complaint, which she said \u201cwas based on a partner who sent out information without my knowledge.\u201d\nNow, Javor is under investigation by Florida\u2019s Department of Business and Professional Regulation, which oversees and regulates the real estate industry, among other professions.\nDBPR is investigating the allegation that Javor obtained her license by fraud and perjury, according to a copy of a complaint submitted to the state.\nA spokesperson for DBPR declined to comment, and said it could not \u201cconfirm or deny\u201d the existence of complaints filed against Javor because the information obtained during an investigation is confidential. No complaints are listed on\nJavor\u2019s license\n. They would only appear on the state\u2019s website if a state panel determines there was probable cause, and rules against the agent or broker.\nAs in many states, DBPR is the only government authority that can revoke a license, issue fines or suspensions, and few agents and brokers face serious repercussions among the total complaints filed, a\nTRD investigation\nlast year found. It\u2019s also a self-regulating system: The state will typically only open an investigation if other brokers, agents or consumers file legally sufficient complaints.\nOftentimes, the most effective recourse that consumers or fellow real estate agents and brokers have is to sue.\nIn 2023, former clients filed two lawsuits against Javor. Matthew Epstein sued in July, and in November, Quentin Gillette and Beth Gillette, founders of a utility systems contractor called PowerGrid Services, filed a separate complaint.\nThe four complaints, including the defamation lawsuit against Galman and the one Signature One filed, are still open, according to Palm Beach County Circuit Court filings.\nEpstein lawsuit\nEpstein, CEO of real estate development and investment firm Delray Beach-based Primark Partners, sued Javor over her involvement in his $5.6 million purchase and subsequent listing of the planned spec mansion at 207 West Coconut Palm Road in Boca\u2019s Royal Palm in 2021.\nEpstein alleges that Javor misrepresented herself as a licensed broker and failed to disclose that she edited a listing agreement. She allegedly falsely represented that she only changed the price, when in reality she altered the commission structure and terms, according to the lawsuit. The edited agreement included conflicting terms saying that Javor was required to share all offers with Epstein, but also that she had the right to withhold verbal offers, according to the lawsuit.\nThe complaint also alleges that Javor lied about having interested buyers, pushing Epstein to sign the listing agreement quickly. While Javor agreed via text to a 2 percent commission, her brokerage Signature One actually was paid a commission of 3 percent, or about $180,000, on a $5.6 million deal.\nJavor also allegedly published inaccurate marketing materials about the property without submitting them to Epstein first, the lawsuit states. Javor allegedly acted \u201cwith the authority to execute the listing agreement, operate her real estate office, and make all decisions related to the marketing and listing of the property contrary to plaintiff\u2019s instructions and objections.\u201d\nJavor and Signature One deny the allegations, court filings show.\n\nSignature One and Javor\u2019s attorney, Brian Koch of Holland &amp; Knight, wrote in a motion late last year that Epstein \u201cmanufactured claims\u201d to avoid his contractual obligations.\n\u201cTo the extent that Epstein claims he did not review what he signed, that is 100% Epstein\u2019s fault \u2014 and he is therefore barred from his own admitted negligence in not reviewing a contract before he signed it.\u201d\nJavor and Signature One filed a motion to compel Epstein to disclose the amounts paid for construction and improvements he made to the property. During his deposition in January, he testified that the project ran over budget and that he made special upgrades to justify a nearly $30 million asking price. The house is now listed with Roberts of Royal Palm Properties for the same price.\nIn a statement to\nTRD\n, Epstein said his complaint \u201cspeaks for itself.\u201d\n\u201cThe fact that Ms. Javor is countersuing me because she believes she\u2019s entitled to a million dollar-plus commission without ever bringing a single written offer is shameful and puts other realtors in a bad light,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cIf Ms. Javor, or any agent for that matter, ever produced a buyer that met my terms and closed the transaction, I would be more than happy to pay the commission that was rightfully earned. However, I refuse to pay for work not performed or held hostage by anyone.\u201d\nSignature One\u2019s broker, Ben Schachter, said in a statement that \u201cpeople can say anything\u201d in a lawsuit. \u201cThe evidence in the case refutes Mr. Epstein\u2019s allegations,\u201d he said.\nGillettes\u2019 lawsuit\nThe Gillettes\u2019 lawsuit, filed in late 2023, alleges that Javor, Signature One, Dennis Lynde and Beaches MLS misrepresented the year the home they bought at 231 Thatch Palm Drive was built. The Gillettes were on the hunt for a newly built home, and based on the listing and a home inspection report provided by Javor, they believed the property was constructed in 2021.\nThe Gillettes entered into a contract with the seller, Lynde, to purchase the house for $10 million, which included a $300,000 commission to Signature One, according to court filings. After closing, the Gillettes then spent about $1.5 million to make improvements to the home, so they could potentially flip it for $15 million, filings show. When they began interviewing brokers to market and sell the house, they discovered the original structure was built in 1971.\n\u201cAs a Realtor, I was not involved in daily construction, but had been advised and was of the belief that the home was newly built,\u201d Javor said in a statement provided to\nTRD\n. \u201cI understand several million dollars went into new additions and the major construction that took place between 2019 and 2021.\u201d\nThe Gillettes ended up selling the property for $10 million, a \u201csubstantial loss,\u201d they allege in their complaint. They allege fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\nThe definition of \u201cnew construction\u201d is at the center of Javor and Signature One\u2019s questioning in a deposition of Beth Gillette.\n\u201cThat house should have been listed as a remodel,\u201d she said in her deposition.\nLawsuits with Arnold Galman\nAbout a year ago, property management mogul Galman began working with Javor. Galman entered into a buyer/broker agreement with Signature One, agreeing to work exclusively with the brokerage for any purchases in Florida for six months. If any deals were to arise, he would owe Signature a 3 percent commission, plus a transaction fee.\nA few days after signing that agreement, Galman signed a contract to pay about $11.8 million for the waterfront mansion at 2348 East Maya Drive in the Royal Palm community. The sale closed in April.\nTheir agreement is at the heart of two lawsuits and at least one counterclaim.\nSignature sued Galman to collect the commission it alleges it\u2019s owed for the deal. The commission is being held in escrow due to the dispute.\nIn a separate complaint, Javor is suing Galman and his company, the Jenkintown, Pennsylvania-based Galman Group, alleging that he has \u201corchestrated a smear campaign \u2026 after his initial bullying and intimidation tactics proved unsuccessful.\u201d\nIn his counterclaim, Galman said that he planned to withdraw his offer and recoup his initial deposit, because he believed the $11.8 million price was too high. But Javor convinced him she could find a buyer to flip the property for a profit of at least $500,000. If not, she would waive her entire commission, according to a letter signed by Javor, which is included in the counterclaim. Galman alleges that Signature One forged Gaiman\u2019s name on the buyer/tenant broker agreement, without his knowledge or consent.\nGalman\u2019s attorney, Stephen Padula of Padula Bennardo Levine, told\nTRD\nthat Galman expected Javor to represent his interests as his agent, but she did not, he said.\nGalman refused to pay the commission, and threatened Javor with allegedly defamatory mailers.\nIn May, a month after the $11.8 million deal closed, Schachter emailed Galman and said that Javor didn\u2019t have the authority to agree to waive her commission. Signature is also suing for a 3 percent commission on a separate deal, Galman\u2019s $515,000 purchase of a townhouse in Boca Raton last May. Signature alleges Galman \u201cintentionally circumvented\u201d Javor\u2019s brokerage.\nTheir battle quickly became unpleasant.\nGalman emailed Javor, Leonard Albanese of Albanese Builders and Schachter that he planned to expose Javor\u2019s alleged \u201cdishonesty and treachery.\u201d\n\u201cHire your lawyers \u2014 you are liars and dishonest !\u201d an email he sent to her reads. \u201cMarcy I am just getting started ~ you know the truth\u2026. you flat out lied to me !\u201d\n",

        "content": "Affiliated Development is the latest South Florida developer to nab construction financing for an apartment project, despite a slowing multifamily market.\nFort Lauderdale-based Affiliated, led by CEO Jeffrey Burns, secured an $80 million loan from Bank of Montreal to build The Era, a planned eight-story building with 400 apartments in the firm\u2019s home city, records show. The developer recently broke ground on The Era, which is on a 2.7-acre assemblage at 2125 South Andrews Avenue that Affiliated bought for\n$15.4 million\nlast year.\nBanks are showing confidence in the South Florida multifamily market, even as the region is experiencing an oversupply of apartments. Last year, developers completed 18,600 rental units, outpacing 15,000 net new leases signed, according to\nCoStar\ndata. Some landlords of new multifamily projects are offering prospective tenants incentives such as free months rent or the waiver of fees.\nYet, Affiliated is the fourth apartment developer to score a construction loan this month. In the biggest financing, New York-based Baron Property Group snagged a\n$206 million\nloan to build Metro Parc North, an eight-story building with 661 apartments in Hialeah.\n\nSantander Bank provided a\n$67.5 million\nconstruction loan for a 383-unit multifamily complex in Davie developed by Coconut Grove-based 13th Floor Investments and Miami Beach-based JSB Capital. TM Real Estate, a developer also based in Coconut Grove, landed\n$53.5 million\nin financing from Truist Bank to build a complex of 10 buildings with 250 units in Boynton Beach.\nBank of Montreal is bullish on Affiliated. In September, the financial institution provided a\n$50 million\nconstruction loan for the developer\u2019s planned 270-unit mixed-income apartment project in West Palm Beach called The Spruce, a press release states.\nFor The Era, Affiliated also received more than $5.5 million in property tax reimbursements from the city of Fort Lauderdale and Broward County in exchange for setting aside 210 units for workforce housing.\nLast year, Affiliated completed\nThe Grand\n, an eight-story building with 301 apartments and ground-floor retail in West Palm Beach. The firm is also developing\nThe Pierce\n, a 236-unit workforce housing project in Boynton Beach. Overall, Affiliated has $1.5 billion worth of projects that are completed or are under construction, the firm\u2019s website states.",

The lawsuit, filed in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, also names as defendants 13 contractors that filed liens between January and this month totaling nearly $950,000 in work that allegedly hasn\u2019t been paid.\nThe contractors include Coconut Grove-based\nArquitectonica\n, which designed the project, and Aventura-based Rieber Developments, which managed construction of\n1212 Aventura\n.\n\u201cMedical District Developments owes my company and multiple other companies money,\u201d Rieber Developments CEO Bernardo Rieber said in an email. \u201cDornin mentions all of us seeking to wipe out the construction debt owed to us.\u201d\n\nMedical District Developments hired Rieber Developments shortly after acquiring the 1.8-acre site for $2.9 million in 2019, records show.\n1212 Aventura\nconsists of 163 assisted living apartments, 39 medical offices spanning 25,796 square feet and 29,684 square feet of retail.\nIn 2021, Medical District Developments increased an existing $15 million loan from Coconut Grove-based BridgeInvest to $63.5 million. But a year later, the property owner allegedly defaulted on the loan by failing to invest its own capital to complete the project.\nBridgeInvest\nwarned Medical District developments that the project had a shortfall of $3.7 million of equity capital to cover cost overruns, the lawsuit states.\nBridgeInvest granted Medical District Developments two forbearances in 2022 and 2023. The second forbearance agreement required the property owner to place $15 million in an account for construction costs, which was provided by an investor that has a pending lawsuit filed in December against Medical District Developments, Rieber Developments and BridgeInvest.\nMedical District Developments allegedly defaulted on the second forbearance agreement by failing to pay the principal and interest owed on the loan by a Dec. 31, 2023 maturity date, the lawsuit states. Last month, Dorin\u2019s affiliate bought the mortgage from BridgeInvest.",

The apartment building would include 23 affordable housing units and 12 workforce housing units. The rental townhouse units would include two designated as affordable housing units and one as workforce housing, according to its amended site plan proposal.\n\nOak Lane also plans to replace about two-thirds of the space in the 130,150-square-foot office building that houses its headquarters with an 11,447-square-foot restaurant, a 2,570-square-feet outdoor dining area and an indoor recreation space spanning 72,428 square feet, the amended site plan proposal shows.\nThe planning and zoning board voted unanimously on Thursday to recommend conditional use approval of the recreation space planned inside the office building, which would include racquet courts, climbing walls, a miniature golf course and a toddler area.\nProperty records show that a company controlled by Oak Lane paid\n$20 million in 2023\nto acquire its 10-acre office property at 791 Park of Commerce Boulevard in\nPark at Broken Sound,\na 700-acre commercial and residential hub in Boca Raton.\nThe Live Local Act\nencourages commercial-industrial multifamily developments with an affordable housing component in areas not zoned for residential property.\nUnder the state law, municipal government staff can approve residential developments in non-residential zones, without review by elected city leaders, if the developments include affordable housing with below-market rents.\u201cThe project meets the eligibility requirements and development standards for CIMDs,\u201d Heather Hansen, a senior planner for the city of\nBoca Raton\n, said at the city\u2019s planning and zoning board meeting on Thursday, referring to Oak Lane\u2019s development.",

The buildings, 136,256 square feet combined, were completed between 1976 and 1980.\nFounded in 2013 by Macfarland, Kohl\u2019s Department Stores co-founder Sidney Kohl and Alliant co-founder James Jenkins, SROA Capital owns 650 self-storage facilities across the nation that total more than 30 million square feet, according to the firm\u2019s website. In South Florida, SROA Capital owns eight self-storage facilities in Palm Beach County, as well as four more in Hollywood, North Miami, Miami and Key West.\nThe $167 average rental rate for a 5-foot-by-5-foot self-storage unit in South Florida is the second highest in the country, according to a recent StorageCafe report. The tri-county region added 234,522 square feet of\nself-storage\nspace last year, representing a 2.7 percent increase, year-over-year, the report found. Developers are planning to complete another 348,159 square feet of new self-storage space this year.\nStill, the industrial subsector has only seen a few trades in the last year. In October, Ladera Ranch, California-based SmartStop acquired a North Miami self-storage facility completed in 2022 for\n$30.8 million\n. And in August, Houston-based Silver Star Properties paid\n$26.5 million\nfor a Delray Beach self-storage facility as part of a company reorganization to focus only on self-storage and single-tenant properties.",

        "content": "Insurance mogul Ivan Herrera\u2019s family office acquired a Miami apartment building for $71.5 million that was developed by the late Sergio Pino.\nThe sale of 850 Living, an eight-story multifamily project with 230 units at 811 Northwest 43rd Avenue, resolves the disposition of another key property among Pino\u2019s numerous assets that his widow,\nTatiana Pino\n, and her brother-in-law, Carlos Pino, are battling over in Miami-Dade family probate court. Separately, a lender filed a foreclosure lawsuit in November, alleging 850 Living\u2019s ownership entity defaulted on a\n$45.4 million\nmortgage debt.\nSale proceeds will pay off the lender, Lument, and the remainder will go to Pino\u2019s estate.\nOn July 16 of last year,\nPino\ndied from a self-inflicted gunshot wound as federal agents were serving a warrant to arrest him for orchestrating a murder-for-hire plot against Tatiana Pino.\n\u201cWorking with the estate\u2019s curator to get [850 Living] sold was the right thing to do,\u201d said Glen Waldman, Tatiana Pino\u2019s lawyer. \u201cWe are pleased with the outcome.\u201d\nCarlos Pino\u2019s attorney Sergio Mendez and representatives for the buyer, an affiliate of Herrera\u2019s\nUnicapital Asset Management Group\n, declined to comment.\n\nNancy Pastor, trustee for 850 Living\u2019s ownership entity who brokered the sale, also declined to comment. Pastor was reportedly dating Sergio Pino, who founded Century Homebuilders Group, one of the largest Hispanic-owned national home development firms.\nThis month, Century Homebuilders, now led by Tatiana Pino, sold three development sites in southwest Miami-Dade County for\n$25 million\nto national homebuilder Lennar in a deal that was approved by Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Yvonne Colodny, who is presiding over the estate case.\nIn August, Colodny appointed Coral Gables-based certified public accountant Philip Schecter as curator of Pino\u2019s estate after Carlos Pino filed motions to be appointed as personal representative of his late brother\u2019s assets.\nTatiana Pino\ncontested her brother-in-law\u2019s motion, but both sides agreed to have an independent curator catalog and appraise Pino\u2019s assets, as well as defend against any lawsuits and handle any taxes owed by the estate, court records show. Funds are being held in a trust until the dispute between Tatiana Pino and Carlos Pino is resolved.\nOn March 12, Colodny approved Schecter\u2019s motion allowing Pastor to sell the apartment building to Herrera\u2019s Unicapital. In January, Herrera launched the family office when he partially sold Univista Insurance for $700 million.\nIn 2021, an entity managed by Herrera, his wife Ania Herrera and Univista COO Luis Castro, paid\n$47.5 million\nfor a two-tower office complex at 850 Northwest 42nd Avenue (also known as Le Jeune Road). Those buildings, as well as 850 Living and a parking garage connecting both projects were developed by Pino and partner Pactia USA.\n850 Living\u2019s ownership entity and the Univista entity filed dueling civil lawsuits in 2023 over use of the garage, but both complaints were dismissed last year, court records show.",

Built in 1926, the Spanish Revival-designed home was used during Prohibition, according to the listing.\nThe seller is Los Angeles-based Black Hill LLC, which state filings indicate is tied to talent manager Mark Gillespie.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Eric Lavey holds the listing.\nSouth of Beverly Hills in Hermosa Beach, is last week\u2019s second-largest home that went into contract, based on a listing price of nearly $12 million.\nThe seller is a trust tied to Dean and Kelli Hallett. Dean Hallett is the president of executive coaching and leadership firm Hallett Leadership. He previously held executive positions at Twentieth Century Fox and Walt Disney Studios.\nJoseph Group\u2019s William Joseph and Rachel Joseph have the listing at 2722 Hermosa Avenue.\nThe four-bed, six-bath home was built in 2020 and totals nearly 4,800 square feet.

It will replace a 1.6-acre field.\nPlans call for a complex of mostly market-rate apartments, with two units set aside as affordable for moderate-income tenants. A project cost and timeline for construction were not disclosed.\n\u201cThis apartment project will provide funding to support the church and its good works for the next 100 years,\u201d Fr. William Goldin, parochial administrator at Our Lady of Guadalupe, told the council.\nThe project received strong pushback from neighbors, who voiced concerns about privacy, traffic and parking. The project also received criticism from affordable housing advocates, who took issue with its mostly market-rate homes.\nCesar Covarrubias, executive director of the Kennedy Commission, a nonprofit advocate based in Irvine, said he noticed the Diocese didn\u2019t seek a density bonus to build more units in exchange for more affordable housing. It also didn\u2019t employ\nSenate Bill 4\n, a state law that streamlines developments on churches and other faith-based properties.\n\u201cIt appears as if they\u2019re trying to do just market-driven development to maximize their return,\u201d Covarrubias said.\n\nThat\u2019s the point, Douglas Woodward, a consultant for the Diocese, told the council.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like any other apartment complex, it just happens to be owned by the Diocese,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an apartment complex where we are going to find people that want to call La Habra home, who want a beautiful new neighborhood and are willing to rent there.\u201d\nThe Diocese of Orange is moving into housing after the Archdiocese of Los Angeles\nannounced in August\nit aimed to turn its unused properties into affordable housing for workers, seniors and at-risk young adults. It\u2019s also following some churches in OC now\nturning properties into homes\n.\nThe Diocese, which oversees 56 parish churches, 41 schools and three hospitals, also plans to build homes in Santa Ana, Irvine and Fullerton. It will consider employing SB 4 to streamline approvals, according to a spokesperson.\n\u201cThe Diocese of Orange is committed to serving both its local faithful and the wider community in ways that align with its values and long-term vision,\u201d Jarryd Gonzales, the Diocese spokesperson, told the Daily Pilot. \u201cAs part of this commitment, we are actively assessing underutilized property assets to better serve our communities and generate funds to support our ministries.\u201d\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "W.P. Carey is selling the Binoculars Building off the Venice Beach Boardwalk,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nThe New York-based real estate investment trust hired CBRE to put the 78,578-square-foot building currently occupied by Google up for sale, according to an offering memo obtained by\nTRD.\nThe brokerage did not provide an asking price for the historic, binoculars-shaped building at 340 West Main Street, but nine other smaller, and less whimsical office buildings currently listed in Venice are asking $1,583 per square foot on average, according to Loopnet. Google\u2019s triple-net-lease at the building,\nwhich dates back to 2011\n, is up for renewal in October 2030, according to the offering memo.\nW.P. Carey\u2019s history with the property goes back much further than Google. The company bought the Venice building\nfor about $18.3 million in 1995\n. In 2023, it\nannounced a massive spinoff of 59 of its office properties\ninto a separate REIT, and the Binoculars Building was\non the list\nfacing a possible reappraisal or sale.\nAside from the Venice location, Google has a campus spanning three buildings in Silicon Beach. The tech giant\u2019s long-term plans for those properties are unclear. Google reversed course on its office expansion in L.A. last year and its former development partners Hudson Pacific and Macerich\nsold the former Los Angeles Mall to the University of California, Los Angeles\u00a0 for about $700 million\n.\nA spokesperson for Google did not immediately provide any comments.\n\nThere will likely be dueling bids for the one-of-a-kind property in Venice, according to CBRE\u2019s Todd Tydlaska, who\u2019s marketing the property along with Sean Sullivan, Michael Longo, Melissa Moock and Grant Goldman.\nTydlaska said through a CBRE spokesperson that there\u2019s already been \u201cstrong initial interest\u201d in the listing. He anticipates a \u201ccompetitive process,\u201d he added via the spokesperson.\nOffice vacancy has fallen faster in West Los Angeles than Downtown, but it\u2019s still hovering around 22 percent, according to a report by CBRE. Current average asking rent for office space in Venice is unclear, but asking rent in neighborhoods like Century City and Marina Del Ray has climbed faster than other parts of the city, reaching an average of $5.57 per square foot last quarter, according to the report.\n\u201cThis listing is a good example of what capital wants in the market right now,\u201d Tydlaska said. \u201cGreat locations, high-profile assets\u2026 at attractive price bases.\u201d\nThe CBRE spokesperson declined to comment further on the listing and a spokesperson for W.P. Carey did not respond to a request for comment.\n",

That leaves about 6,000 homes in the Palisades and surrounding areas to go.\n\u201cWe want this to be happening on your lot, too,\u201d Mayor Karen Bass said at a news conference in the Palisades.\nThe first permit was issued March 5, nearly two months after the Jan. 7 Palisades fire ripped through half the upscale neighborhood along the coast\nAnother approved permit was for repairs to a fire-damaged master bedroom, bathroom and garage of a split-level home near Rustic Canyon, according to city records and Paul Lobana, the structural engineer for the project. The homeowner submitted plans to city inspectors Feb. 17.\nThe Times wasn\u2019t able to contact the owner of the third property that received a permit to rebuild a home on bluffs overlooking Pacific Coast Highway.\nAs of last week, 72 property owners had submitted rebuilding applications to the city, according to the newspaper.\nAnother 135 property owners submitted blueprints to the L.A. County Department of Public Works for rebuilding in unincorporated areas \u2014 109 in the Eaton fire zone and 26 in the Palisades fire area.\n\nThe county is not approving plans until all debris clearing is complete on the property, Celeste Hampton, a department spokesperson, told the Times.\nBass and L.A. County leaders\nhave promised to streamline\npermitting procedures for homeowners who want to rebuild.\nThe city and county have opened\none-stop permitting centers\nfor fire victims. They\u2019ve also waived discretionary hearings and zoning reviews for those who want to replace their homes with projects of about the same size.\nLocal and state and local officials\nare still determining rebuilding rules\n, including if there will be any changes to building codes to incentivize or require more fire-resistant materials that might affect future permit approvals, according to the Times.\nThis week, Bass\nupdated an existing executive order\nclarifying that new accessory dwelling units would qualify for streamlined permitting. She issued another order to further expedite reviews for homeowners who choose to rebuild with all-electric systems and appliances.\n\u201cWildfires aren\u2019t going away,\u201d Bass told reporters. \u201cAnd climate-fueled disasters aren\u2019t going away, either.\u201d\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is reportedly looking into what\u2019s been a sore spot for real estate since 2023:\nMeasure ULA\n.\nThe 2022 ballot measure, often called the \u201cmansion tax,\u201d applies a tiered assessment to residential and commercial sales within the city. The tax is adjusted each year to account for changes in consumer spending. Thresholds set to go into effect June 30 apply a 4 percent tax on properties starting at $5.3 million and 5.5 percent on those $10.6 million or more.\nNow, city attorneys are looking into the possibility of temporarily nixing ULA to help expedite efforts to rebuild the fire-torn Pacific Palisades, which is part of Los Angeles.\n\u201cThere\u2019s two schools of thought,\u201d Bass said in response to a question on ULA\u2019s pause from\nBreitbart\nduring a March 11 press conference. \u201cOne is, that can\u2019t happen. It has to go back to voters. And the other is that it might be able to happen with action from the council and the mayor\u2019s office.\u201d\nSounds like Bass may have taken a cue from Jason Oppenheim and Ben Belack, who\nopined in a January\nletter, signed by nearly 50 of their colleagues, who called for the loosening of restrictions during the rebuilding process. Among the calls to action was a suggestion that property in fire-affected areas be exempt from Measure ULA.\nOn Feb. 21,\nThe Real Deal\nreached out to Bass\u2019s press team inquiring if it had reviewed the letter and if the suggestions were being considered. A spokesperson for the mayor requested a copy of the letter but did not comment on whether the proposals were under consideration.\nCaruso: \u201ctime and place for politics\u2026is not now\u201d\nThe Grove developer\nRick Caruso\nmade it clear where he stands on a recall attempt of Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, casting it as \u201cnot a good idea.\u201d\nThe comment made on Caruso\u2019s X account was in relation to a recall committee formed earlier this month, helmed by Los Angeles-area agent Sahil Nandwani. The recall effort aims to seize on discontent over Bass\u2019s handling of the Palisades Fire, in addition to safety and housing needs.\n\u201cThere is a time and place for politics, but it is not now,\u201d Caruso said on X, further characterizing such actions as \u201ccostly and expensive political distractions.\u201d\nNicole Shanahan\n, former Robert F. Kennedy Jr. running mate and ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, sought to poke Caruso over his stance asking over X if \u201cpeople deserve accountability.\u201d\nCaruso, who has been outspoken in his critique of Bass and the city\u2019s handling of the fires, reminded Shanahan \u201ca recall election doesn\u2019t happen overnight\u201d and would end up being a costly endeavor.\nOvation Hollywood struggles with occupancy as valuation dives\n\nThe mixed-use property at Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue has seen its value drop as occupancy has also dipped.\nOvation Hollywood\n, which was rebranded from Hollywood &amp; Highland, was recently appraised at $257 million by Morningstar. That\u2019s off 24 percent from $338 million in 2019, despite about $100 million spent in updating the property in 2023.\nThe entertainment and retail center currently counts Shoe Palace, Sephora, Lids, Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 and Johnny Rockets among its tenants.\nShopoff looks to redevelop Buena Park industrial site into housing\nShopoff Realty Investments\nsaw something in a Buena Park industrial site and seized on the opportunity to buy.\nThe Irvine-based development company paid nutritional products maker Amway $60 million for its nearly 14-acre industrial property that Shopoff plans to redevelop into townhomes.\nShopoff President and CEO William Shopoff said in a statement Buena Park \u201coffers a tremendous opportunity for strategic redevelopment\u201d and the company is moving forward on entitlements for its proposed project. The property sits next to the Metrolink and has proximity to Interstate 5 and State Route 91.\nAzria Estate tries on a new price: $39M\nThe\nAzria Estate\nin Holmby Hills has made a fashionable re-entrance into Los Angeles\u2019 luxury residential market.\nThe property at 10250 West Sunset Boulevard, which is being sold by fashion designer Lubov Azria, was recently re-listed for $39 million. That\u2019s down from a high of as much as $88 million as the property\u2019s swung on and off the market for about a decade.\nAzria is the wife of the late Max Azria, founder of BCBG.\nThe re-list comes after Yucaipa Companies founder\nRon Burkle\nsued Lubov Azria after an auction of the property in which the investor had the winning bid went south. Burkle ultimately asked a judge to toss the case late last year.",

Freddie Mac has similar guidelines, but doesn\u2019t keep such a list.\nThe mortgage blacklist has left homeowners stuck with unsellable condos,\naccording to the Wall Street Journal.\nNationwide, 5,191 condo complexes out of 150,000 complexes nationwide were blacklisted, or 3.5 percent of all condos.\n\nThe blacklist has ballooned across SoCal, which contains 64 percent of the 685 blackwashed complexes across the state.\nOf the 438 Southland complexes shunned by Fannie, the lion\u2019s share are in Los Angeles County, with 237. San Diego County has 98, Orange County 70, Riverside County 19 and San Bernardino County 14.\nFannie and sister organization\nFreddie\ndon\u2019t make loans, but buy roughly half of the country\u2019s home loans from lenders and package them to sell to investors, then guarantee payments on them, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nLoans that meet their underwriting standards can be cheaper, and require lower down payments than bespoke mortgages.\nAcross Southern California, condos have often served as an entry point to home ownership. Condo listings across the region jumped 61.8 percent this month to 7,781 units, compared with 4,809 a year ago, according to the Register.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "Chicago retail magnate Fred Latsko is bringing a new buzz to Fulton Market, while also hanging onto his last one.\nHe expanded his hold on the city\u2019s market for cigar lounges with a store and private club called Chicago Cut that opened at 1003 West Fulton Street earlier this month, shortly after the landlord scored $22 million in fresh debt from New York-based Argentic Real Estate Finance, public records show.\nThe loan helps to refinance the 15,000-square-foot\nGuinness Open Gate Brewery\nsite at 901 West Kinzie Street, which Latsko owns and considered selling for over $20 million last year.\nHe elected to hang onto the property rather than sell it, after listing it with JLL brokers in October 2023. Latsko also put up some of his expansive Gold Coast retail holdings, at 23 West Maple and\n66 East Walton streets\n, as collateral for the Argentic loan. The former is leased to high-end convenience store chain\nFoxtrot\nafter that brand\u2019s revival from shuttering all of its stores last year. The Walton Street asset landed a 10-year deal with luxury consignment retailer TheRealReal a few months ago.\nChicago Cut joins Biggs Mansion, at 1150 North Dearborn Street in the Gold Coast, as another private cigar club within Latsko\u2019s portfolio. While Latsko renovated Biggs\u2019 interior 11 years ago, it\u2019s a historic building \u2014 constructed in 1874 for Northern Trust co-founder John Dekoven \u2014 that retained its classical look. The Fulton Market spot is meant to appeal to a more youthful crowd in the trendy neighborhood.\n\nLatsko paid $2.1 million to buy the Chicago Cut location in 2020. Its first level is a cigar shop open to the public, while the upper floors require memberships costing an initiation fee of $3,750 and then monthly dues of $375.\n\u201cWhy did I open Chicago Cut? More for the younger, more contemporary clientele of West Loop as another option,\u201d Latsko said. \u201cBiggs Mansion being a Chicago landmark located in the Gold Coast has the reputation as the finest cigar shop/club in the world.\u201d\nThe landlord\u2019s moves allowed him to partially pay down his previous\n$34 million loan\nfrom fellow Chicago-based real estate player Jeff Aeder\u2019s firm JDI that was levied against key properties in Latsko\u2019s retail portfolio, public records show.\nAdditionally, proceeds from Latsko\u2019s recent\n$17 million sale to the family behind Max Mara\n, as well as the refinancing of TheRealReal and Foxtrot properties, helped to pay down the JDI loan balance.\nLatsko, a lifelong Chicagoan, is also marketing a second home in West Palm Beach, Florida, for a little more than $6.2 million, and eyeing a residential purchase in the Los Angeles area. The Florida home spans 6,500 square feet with six bedrooms and seven bathrooms at 1017 North Flagler Drive, just off the waterfront with a view of nearby Palm Beach island. The property last sold for $3.2 million in 2021, and originally asked $8.9 million when first hitting the market in 2023. Suzanne Frisbie of the Corcoran Group has the listing.\n",

BP has held office space in the CME Center since 2009.\nMany office tenants downsized, relocated or went fully remote after the pandemic disrupted in-person work. The re-shuffling pushed landlords to scale up amenities to entice tenants.\nTishman has renovated the property\u2019s lobby, fa\u00e7ade and entrances while adding amenities such as a 24-hour fitness facility, 175-seat conference room, lounge and library.\n\nThe complex spans two 40-story towers totaling 2.3 million square feet. Other tenants include the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Wells Fargo, law firm Reed Smith and accounting services firm RSM.\nThe move was a win from the Loop, which has seen a flow of office tenants to the West Loop and Fulton Market seeking modern offices and loft style buildings converted from warehouse space over the past decade. Since the pandemic, the loop\u2019s office vacancy rate has been stuck around 30 percent.\nFulton Market is the only submarket in downtown Chicago with vacancy under 20 percent, and it also has the highest asking rents, averaging over $61 per square foot for Class A space. In the Central Loop, the vacancy rate is close to 28 percent, and average asking rents for Class A is under $50 per square foot.\nIt was also another boost for Tishman Speyer, which was on the brokerage side of\na recent lease expansion at 222 North La Salle\n. The firm represented the landlord, Henry Crown and Company, in a 15,700 square foot office expansion for fintech firm NinjaTrader.\n",

Farley also put his unit on the market in August 2023 with\nan initial asking price of $16 million\n, making it the second-priciest listing in the city at the time. Since then, the price on the 14th-floor home has been slashed nearly in half to $8.45 million.\nLurie\u2019s unit has three main formal rooms that span 63 feet, with views of Oak Street Beach and the near North Side lakefront.\n\nOriginally from Florida, Lurie moved to Chicago and worked as a pediatric intensive care nurse at Children\u2019s Memorial Hospital, later renamed to the Ann &amp; Robert H. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital to honor her nine-figure donation.\nHer husband, Robert Lurie \u2014 real estate investor and business partner of billionaire Sam Zell \u2014 left a $425 million estate when he died in 1990. By 2012, Ann Lurie had given away $331 million to philanthropic causes, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nBeyond her support for the children\u2019s hospital, Lurie gave $60 million to Northwestern University and Northwestern Memorial Hospital. She also donated $5 million to the Greater Chicago Food Depository and $10 million to establish a 2.5-acre park downtown known as the\nLurie Garden in Millennium Park\n.\nAnn Lurie also invested in real estate, selling the family\u2019s lakefront Winnetka home for $5.5 million in 1997 and purchasing a Gold Coast mansion on Dearborn Street for just under $5.1 million in 1995. In 2017, she sold the Gold Coast home to the Latin School of Chicago for $12 million. Not all of her real estate ventures were successful, though. She bought an East Lake Shore condo for just under $4.7 million in 2007 and sold it a decade later for $2 million.\nLurie died last year at age 79 after she was diagnosed with a form of cancer called glioblastoma.\n",

        "content": "Data centers are not always welcomed with open arms in rural communities.\nBut some local leaders in Illinois area eager to overcome the facilities\u2019 environmental obstacles in hopes of generating property tax revenues and job opportunities, the Chicago Tribune\nreported.\nData center giant Equinix is working on securing approvals for a data center in Minooka, a rural community about 50 miles southwest of Chicago. The town\u2019s mayor, Ric Offerman, is helping push the project along.\nOfferman\u2019s encouragement joins a growing trend of data center development in Illinois.\nIn 2023, ComEd predicted a 40 percent increase in its electricity deliveries by 2040, primarily because of data centers.\nElectricity demand from data centers in Northeast Illinois alone is expected to triple as new leases and proposed data centers come on line, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield.\nOfferman joins other local leaders who are supportive of the proposals despite their environmental concerns.\nAbout 20 miles north of Minooka, the town of Yorkville has fully embraced the data center sector, city administrator Bart Olson said. The town recently approved its first 230-acre data center and has received interest from investors and data center companies and investors eyeing land totaling 3,000 acres.\nBack in Minooka, the Equinix project will cover 340 acres and require 700 megawatts of electricity a day. That\u2019s about the same amount of electricity needed to power half of the households in the city of Chicago.\n\nCooling the facility will also require 3 million gallons of water per day from a $1.54 billion pipeline currently under construction from Lake Michigan.\nMeeting those needs will pay off for Minooka, Offerman said, because the project will boost the town\u2019s property tax revenues and create hundreds of jobs.\nState environmental regulators will have a say in the project\u2019s approval.\n\u201cOne of the questions the state will ask is, is it really the highest and best use of a finite resource to use drinkable water to cool a computer?\u201d said Hugh O\u2019Hara, executive director of the Will County Governmental League.\nSome Equinix facilities overseas use \u201cgray water\u201d otherwise known as wastewater to reduce competition over drinking water. But the process and the regulations needed to accompany it have not been developed in the U.S. Equinix, which is based in California, operates 260 data centers in 33 countries.\nAn alternative option is cooling the data center with electricity, which presents its own challenges. Doing so could drive up electricity costs for residents and derail the state\u2019s goal to eliminate fossil fuel use for power plants by 2045.\nOfferman said he wants to help find a way to provide the water or energy needed to cool the plant and keep the project moving forward.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best use of that land except for farmland,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s much better than a hundred different things they could put there.\u201d\n",

The hotel could operate the hotel component slated for the 40-story mixed-use tower planned on the site, which is also approved for 350,000 square feet of office space, 275 apartments and retail.\nOn the South Side, developer Allison Davis, through his entity Aquinnah Investment Trust, is proposing to build a\n28-story, 250-key hotel property\nnear the almost complete Barack Obama Presidential Library, at 6402 South Stony Island Avenue.\nAnd in the Gold Coast, an investment group led by\nWheeling-based Marsha Forsythe\nacquired the historic 285-key hotel at 1301 North State Parkway, settling a\n2023 foreclosure lawsuit\nagainst its previous owner, a Gaw Capital affiliate, for allegedly defaulting on a $38.5 million loan.\n\nChicago multifamily landlords are\ntaking a political stand\nagainst the anti-gentrification ordinance that went into effect in Northwest Side neighborhoods and Pilsen this month. They\u2019re trying to rally support to stymie or overturn a rule that gives tenants the right of first refusal to buy apartment buildings imposed as part of the law, claiming that it could prevent sales from closing and deter investment.\nMeanwhile, lenders and landlords are still frustrated with each other at major Chicagoland properties.\nBank OZK\nwrote down an additional $17 million\nfrom its loan to Sterling Bay for its stalled Lincoln Yards project, ballooning the total to $38 million that the lender has charged off on its initial $128 million loan to the developer.\nItasca-based\nHamilton Partners\nis also aiming to get a suburban Downers Grove office debt back on track after it was sent to special servicer CW Capital with a $57 million remaining balance and an \u201cimminent\u201d default predicted. The landlord\u2019s co-owner in the property,\nAccesso Partners\n, is hesitant to contribute any additional capital to saving the deal as it already faces numerous legal and financial challenges with major Chicagoland real estate loans.\nStill, Bank OZK, a key construction lender, hasn\u2019t redlined the Chicago-area from putting new deals on its books. It led a\n$55 million construction loan\nthat included a $9.9 million mezzanine debt from an insurer to developer VennPoint Real Estate, which is led by Nick Marietti and aims to build 144 rental townhomes in Deerfield with the money.\n",

        "content": "Russ Burns, who began steering the massive Chicago-based construction, development and design firm Clayco when its founder Bob Clark was forced to step back for family reasons, died Thursday. He was 65.\nBurns spent 41 years as an executive at nationally renowned contractors, including the past 23 as president and CEO of Clayco. His death was confirmed by Clark, and the cause was cancer.\n\u201cHe and I were like Simon and Garfunkel. We had an amazing run,\u201d Clark said. \u201cWe could finish each other\u2019s sentences, and yet we were good at different things which is what made the partnership so strong.\u201d\nBurns was a part of Clayco\u2019s decision to move its headquarters from St. Louis to Chicago, where it maintains workspace in the historic Jeweler\u2019s Building at 35 East Wacker Drive. Clayco also recently opened a new office building in St. Louis that the firm named the Russ Burns Building.\n\u201cWe lost a great one in Russ. One of the most class acts of all time,\u201d said Shawn Clark, son of Clayco founder Bob Clark and the CEO of its real estate development arm CRG.\nThe elder Clark brought Burns on to run Clayco as its president in 2007, as Clark was unable to lead the business as normal following the diagnosis of his late wife Ellen\u2019s terminal illness around that time, according to Burns\u2019 LinkedIn profile and Bob Clark\u2019s blog.\nBurns\u2019 move to Clayco followed 21 years as an executive vice president for Turner Construction. He led a period of explosive growth for Clayco: in 2007 when Burns came onboard, the firm generated $700 million in revenue; last year it was about $8 billion, Clark said.\n\n\u201cWithin six to eight weeks of Russ coming to the Clayco office three days a week as a \u2018consultant,\u2019 it became apparent that everybody in the company was not only impressed with him but was also following him \u2014 including me,\u201d Clark wrote. \u201cHe had become the leader of all of us in very short order.\u201d\nAfter serving as Clayco\u2019s president for seven years, Burns\u2019 title became CEO for the past decade until he retired at the end of last year. Under Burns\u2019 direction in recent years, Clayco set itself up to help lead the data center boom now underway as artificial intelligence innovation and the economy\u2019s increasing reliance on cloud storage drive demand for computing power across the nation.\nBurns is survived by his wife Allison and son Tyler, said Bob Clark, who called Burns \u201cmy closest buddy, mentor, and the good angel on so many shoulders\u201d in a death announcement made Friday.\nThe CEO title was absorbed by\nClayco\u2019s Anthony Johnson\nearlier this year, following five years as president of the firm\u2019s industrial business unit that led to $3.6 billion in revenue from data center projects last year, half of its total.\n\u201cRuss taught us all to be better leaders, better bosses, better fathers, better husbands, and better humans,\u201d Johnson wrote on social media.\nEditor\u2019s note: This story was updated to clarify the amount of time Burns spent as CEO of Clayco.\n",

        "content": "Hamilton Partners scored a tenant at its Esplanade IV office building in Downers Grove, a win for the landlord as it scrambles to stabilize its troubled suburban office complex it co-owns with Accesso Partners.\nMatson Logistics, a transportation and supply chain company, leased nearly 21,000 square feet at 1901 Butterfield Road, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The firm will relocate from a 17,000-square-foot space at 1815 South Meyers Road in Oakbrook Terrace this August.\nThe deal was brokered by Colliers\u2019 Sven Sykes, Tom Volini and Brent Jacob for Matson, and Phil Sheriden for Hamilton.\nThe move boosts Esplanade IV\u2019s occupancy to 80 percent, according to CoStar, and reflects the \u201cflight to quality\u201d trend among tenants seeking modern offices to entice workers.\nThe lease follows a recent restructuring of the building\u2019s debt. Hamilton and Accesso struck a deal with lender Jackson National Life Insurance to cut their $30 million loan on Esplanade IV and neighboring Esplanade V to $19.6 million, extending its maturity to 2028.\nBut the landlords face a more urgent threat next door. Esplanade I, the 19-story, 536,000-square-foot anchor of the campus, is tied to a $69 million CMBS loan that was transferred to special servicing in February.\n\nHamilton, a minority owner, has\nbegun workout talks\nwith servicer CWCapital, but its larger joint venture partner, Accesso, has so far declined to reinvest, pushing Hamilton to shoulder turnaround costs and risk diluting Accesso\u2019s equity stake.\nAccesso is juggling distress elsewhere in its portfolio, having surrendered a Loop tower at 20 North Clark and facing a\n$75 million foreclosure at 200 West Monroe\n. Several of Accesso\u2019s suburban Chicago assets, some of which were purchased from Hamilton, ended up in\nforeclosure\n.\nAt Esplanade I, occupancy stands at 72 percent, but revenue has fallen below breakeven levels. Its former anchor tenant, Hillshire Brands, exited a 72,000-square-foot annex in 2023, and Hamilton is now targeting food processing tenants to backfill the space.\nMeanwhile, the building Matson is exiting in Oakbrook Terrace is struggling too. Its $19.3 million CMBS loan was recently transferred to special servicing after the loss of Matson and marketing agency InteQ.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

The land has been in the Wirtz family for six generations.\nIf any of those districts express interest, the district says it will pursue detachment of the site, citing the \u201cunsustainable financial burden\u201d of serving up to 940 new students it projects to enroll as Wirtz Realty Corporation\u2019s 3,600-home development is built out over the next two decades.\nThe suburb annexed the Ivanhoe Village land in late 2022.\nThe letter follows a\nrenewed round of talks\nearlier this month between the Wirtz family and local school leaders after negotiations collapsed in January.\nFremont officials say the Wirtz team recently offered a $3.8 million impact fee, while the district is seeking $90.1 million \u2014 about 75 percent of the projected cost of building a new school\u200b.\n\nThe district would be open to structuring a rebate program if tax revenue from the site proves sufficient over time, Fremont Superintendent Trisha Kocanda said. But she emphasized that Fremont doesn\u2019t have the space to serve the incoming students and can\u2019t wait until after they arrive to start building.\nMundelein officials pushed back, posting a statement disputing the district\u2019s enrollment projections and citing regional data showing enrollment has dropped more than 9 percent in the past five years, despite the addition of hundreds of new homes.\nThe letter drew mixed reactions from nearby districts.\nSome said they don\u2019t have the capacity to absorb Ivanhoe Village, while others are reviewing the proposal. The Fremont superintendent acknowledged the detachment plan is \u201catypical\u201d and would require creative redistricting but insisted the Wirtz proposal as it stands would unfairly offload school construction costs onto current residents.\nThe Wirtz family has not publicly commented on the school district\u2019s latest proposal. A previous plan for the village to vote on impact fee terms earlier this month was postponed to allow talks to continue.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

He began buying property in the tower in 2019.\nHe raised his concerns to the board\u2019s then-president \u2014 allegedly a vendor with a flooring company that does business with the building \u2014 but says they were dismissed.\nThe lawsuit alleges Dorneanu heard of misconduct by high-level employees from vendors and staff, and that after writing to Trump Inc. executives and other board members, a June 2024 internal investigation served more as a \u201ccover up\u201d than an address to his concerns.\n\nTrump Inc. later responded to Dorneanu, stating his claims were \u201cirrefutably not supported by facts,\u201d the suit says.\nDorneanu resigned from the board in August and claims building management retaliated by barring him from using amenities like the spa and health club in November. In February, he was arrested for trespassing after entering the building\u2019s spa steam room, an incident his lawsuit ties directly to his concerns.\nThe complaint does not list a specific dollar amount in damages, and neither Trump Inc. nor the condo board president has publicly responded.\nThe case adds to the list of legal disputes and financial woes that have plagued the Trump Tower since its completion in 2009. Those include a potential\ntax bill exceeding $100 million\nthat the Internal Revenue Service deemed was due to questionable accounting practices related to the property, and other claims that\nDonald Trump made false statements\nregarding a loan tied to the skyscraper.\nMeanwhile, a\nSeptember ruling by a Cook County judge\nfound the building\u2019s cooling water intake system has illegally drawn in and killed thousands of fish from the Chicago River for years, deeming the building a \u201cpublic nuisance.\u201d\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Sterling Bay\u2019s lender has lost more confidence in the developer\u2019s delayed Lincoln Yards plan as the developer is up against key deadlines to pay off big debts tied to the project.\nBank OZK, one of the nation\u2019s largest construction lenders, conceded that it\u2019s unlikely to be paid back another $17 million borrowed by Sterling Bay for the project, according to public disclosures the financial institution made earlier this year.\nThe move to write down a second big chunk of the $128 million loan that the Chicago-based developer took out in November 2019 follows Bank OZK last year making a\n$21 million chargeoff\nand placing the debt on substandard non-accrual status \u2014 a label denoting high risk of default.\nAfter the initial chargeoff, Sterling Bay made a $1.9 million payment to the bank last quarter to bring it current on interest payments, and it received another short-term extension of the debt\u2019s maturity date \u2014 it had previously received multiple maturity extensions, including one last year before the first writedown.\nWith Bank OZK\u2019s concession that $38 million is likely unrecoverable on the deal, and Sterling Bay\u2019s latest payment, the total loan balance was reduced to $88 million, according to the lender\u2019s public disclosures. The debt level was 72 percent of the property\u2019s appraised value as of June, the lender said, pegging the estimated market price for the land at about $122 million.\nDallas-based private equity firm Lone Star Funds partnered with Sterling Bay to buy the site encumbered by the Bank OZK loan as part of a 53-acre assemblage. The ownership venture spent $136 million in 2016 to buy the former A. Finkl &amp; Sons steel property that\u2019s subject to the loan, as the developer worked to solidify its grip on land along the Chicago River between Lincoln Park and Bucktown, public records show.\nLone Star and Lincoln Yards\u2019 other financial backer, JP Morgan Asset Management, has since sought to exit the project by selling its stakes in the land holdings at a discount. Those decisions sent Sterling Bay into the market for new capital partners, but it\u2019s so far been unsuccessful in its search for an investor willing to rescue the stalled project.\n\u201cWe all are committed to the transformative vision of Lincoln Yards and are in active discussions,\u201d Sterling Bay said through a spokesperson. Bank OZK declined comment and referred questions to the borrower.\n\nSterling Bay last year was cozying up to Los Angeles-based investment firm\nKayne Anderson\nas a potential investment partner, after\nChicago\u2019s teacher pension fund passed on Sterling Bay\u2019s courtship\nas the developer sought a $300 million infusion. But so far Kayne Anderson and other investors haven\u2019t entered the picture.\nBank OZK noted the land loan accounted for less than 1 percent of its total construction and land development loans.\nBut it\u2019s not the only deal the bank has with Sterling Bay within the vicinity \u2014 there\u2019s a second running up against its maturity date without any revenue coming in from the property at 1229 West Concord Place, Cook County records show. That\u2019s next door to Lincoln Yards, where Sterling Bay completed a 320,000-square-foot lab and office building aimed at life sciences tenants. Yet it hasn\u2019t been able to draw a tenant and remains fully vacant.\nThe landlord has a separate $125 million construction loan from Bank OZK that it needs to pay off or refinance by a mid-September maturity date, unless the developer scores another maturity extension from the lender.\nSterling Bay\nCEO Andy Gloor publicly blamed\nformer Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s administration for Lincoln Yards delays. He accused it of dragging its feet in approving a deal with a Wisconsin\u2019s Public Finance Authority plan that would have kickstarted infrastructure work on the development site.\nLightfoot rebuffed that take, instead claiming that Sterling Bay didn\u2019t bring the city into the discussion of the proposed financing deal until it had been fully negotiated, forcing city officials into a difficult position of verifying that taxpayers wouldn\u2019t be harmed. By the time the deal was ready to finalize, the economic environment shifted as interest rates rose, sinking a groundbreaking on infrastructure.\nSterling Bay also bought more time at its Fulton Market office building at 333 North Green Street after\nhaggling with another lender\nover a proposed paydown. The developer and its partner in that property, JP Morgan Asset Management, made a $19 million payment to their lender Wells Fargo to further extend the maturity date on a $230 million loan against the 553,000-square-foot building.\n",

Last summer, a judge had moved the deadline to March 31 for the sale of two of the city\u2019s largest hotels, at 333 O\u2019Farrell Street and 55 Cyril Magnin Street, respectively.\nThe judge also pushed out the lender\u2019s foreclosure deadline to July 15 if a sale wasn\u2019t completed by then.\nIn 2023, Virginia-based Park Hotels &amp; Resorts defaulted on a\n$725 million loan\ntied to both hotels.\nRusso\u2019s sale extension request states \u201cthe Receiver has made substantial progress on a sale of the hotels to a third party\u2026 and believes she will be in a position to file a motion to approve the sale imminently.\u201d\nThat aligns with this month\u2019s report on bondholders for the debt, which states a non-binding term sheet has been executed with the buyer, according to the Business Times. But the report does note \u201cmaterial terms\u201d are still being negotiated on the draft purchase and sale agreement.\n\n\u201cThere is still a risk that these material terms are not agreed upon and [the] receiver will not be able to close the sale,\u201d the report states.\nA bondholder report from early February said the debt\u2019s special servicer expected a deal would be finalized within 30 days, though that didn\u2019t happen.\nIn 2016, the properties were appraised at $1.56 billion, with an occupancy of 90 percent and revenue per available room of $217.\nThey\u2019ve since lost more than\n$1 billion in value\n, according to the Business Times. At the same time, their $553.6 million valuation last year from Kroll Bond Rating Agency \u201cis exceedingly generous,\u201d sources told the Business Times.\nLast year, the physically joined hotels had a $34 million net operating deficit, with a 12-month occupancy of 40.5 percent and revenue per available room at $96.24, a 56 percent drop in eight years.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Not anymore.\nTenants are vacating more offices than they\u2019re leasing, a trend since a broad shift to remote work during the pandemic.\nThis week, cybersecurity firm Okta listed more than 70,000 square feet of offices for sublease at 100 First Street, a 27-story office tower where it has leased 14 floors since 2017, an unidentified source told the Chronicle. It\u2019s the\nsecond time\nthe firm shed offices since 2021.\nAt the same time, an office shuttered by Indeed last year at 201 Mission Street also hit the market. The company has since pulled out of San Francisco, according to an unidentified spokesperson.\n\nOn a positive note, sublease availability in San Francisco fell 10 percent to 7.1 million square feet this quarter, from 7.9 percent last period, according to CBRE. The surfeit of offices available for sublease has decreased since the beginning of last year, when 8.9 million square feet were available.\nLandlords inked more than than 2 million square feet of office leases in the quarter ending March 31, 50 percent more than a year earlier, CBRE determined. But leasing activity so far this quarter fell 20 percent from last quarter, when owners leased out 2.5 million square feet.\nColin Yasukochi, executive director for CBRE\u2019s Tech Insights Center, said office vacancy dipped to 33.8 percent in the Financial District, from 34 percent at the end of last year.\nClass A office towers in the north and south Financial Districts were poised to have positive net absorption of 100,000 square feet, according to Colliers.\nDerek Daniels, director of research for Colliers, predicted the quarter will likely end with 2.7 million square feet of leases signed.\n\u201cThere is optimism for the office recovery to continue in 2025 considering increasing \u2026 leasing activity. It is expected that capital market activity will pick up as well,\u201d Daniels, referring to building sales, told the Chronicle. \u201cTrends in RTO [to-office] point toward an increasing in-office presence for some of the city\u2019s largest occupiers.\u201d\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

And California Forever, backers of a proposed city in Solano County, wants to help build them.\nThe Fairfield-based firm backed by Silicon Valley billionaires has proposed a shipyard on 1,400 acres near Collinsville, where the Sacramento River ends in tidal Delta estuaries, the\nSan Francisco Business Times reported\n.\nSupporters say the shipyard could take advantage of tax credits and federal infrastructure funding from an executive order Trump is expected to sign this week. His \u201cMake Shipbuilding Great Again\u201d order calls for an overhaul of the U.S. maritime industry,\naccording to USNI News\n.\nRio Vista Mayor Edwin Okamura\nposted on Facebook\nthat he and the city manager had met with retired military leaders, county officials and representatives from California Forever to discuss the proposed shipyard.\n\u201cWe are very early in the process, and are working with elected officials and local communities to explore how we can best use these assets to support American Sailors and stimulate economic growth in our cities, county and broader region,\u201d an unidentified California Forever spokesperson said in a statement.\n\u201cBringing this industry back to Solano County will require all of us to work together on this generational opportunity.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s order calls for creating an Office of Shipbuilding, which he said would \u201cresurrect\u201d the American shipbuilding industry and provide tax incentives to\nbring it \u201chome to America.\u201d\n\u201cWe used to make so many ships,\u201d Trump said this month. \u201cWe don\u2019t make them anymore very much, but we\u2019re going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact.\u201d\n\nIt could also impact plans by California Forever, whose controversial proposal to build a utopian city of 400,000 residents on secretly bought farmland\nstalled last summer\nafter a county report said the project that was to have gone before voters last fall \u201cmay not be financially feasible.\u201d\nA ballot initiative had been slated to go before Solano County voters in November, but was pulled last July after months of poor polling and public skepticism. California Forever now plans to go before voters next year, after agreeing to cooperate with county officials on an environmental impact report.\nIn January, Suisun City\nvoted to consider annexing California Forever\u2019s land\n, shifting part of the development from county to city land in an end-run around\nvoter approval requirements\n.\nThe shipbuilding proposal is also expected to be met with strong resistance from the project\u2019s opponents, who already have voiced concerns over the environmental impacts of the plan, according to the Business Times.\nThe California Forever spokesperson said the shipbuilding operation falls in line with a 1989 county study that identified the southern Montezuma Hills as the \u201clargest vacant site on the West Coast currently approved for heavy industry or marine terminal use, and the only one in California of more than a few hundred acres.\u201d\nThe county supervisors zoned more than 1,400 acres for maritime industrial uses in response, and included the industrial designation in its 2008 general plan. California Forever said Solano County is uniquely positioned to rebuild the country\u2019s naval power, developing shipbuilding, ship repair and related maritime industries.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "San Francisco\u2019s commercial market saw some signs of life this week, with two new artificial intelligence leases and the welcome news that San Francisco finally ditched its last-place return-to-office ribbon.\nFor the first time since\nPlacer.ai began tracking office visits\nin the early days of the pandemic, San Francisco has\nbested\nanother major U.S. city in RTO figures. The city had 47.5 percent fewer office visits in February 2025, compared with the pre-Covid month of February 2019, while Chicago saw a 48.5 percent decline in the same time period, according to Placer.ai office data.\n\u201cThere are green shoots everywhere in San Francisco, and these numbers are an early indication that we are moving in the right direction,\u201d Mayor Daniel Luire, who\nrecently set an April 28 deadline\nfor city workers to be in-office four days a week, told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cOur administration is leading by example, and many of our partners in the private sector are on the same page, bringing workers back to the office and kickstarting our downtown recovery.\u201d\nSan Francisco Chief Economist Ted Egan cautioned that Placer.ai\u2019s data \u201cshows a lot of volatility\u201d from month to month, and is just one indicator of RTO strength. But combined with other data points, like increased transit ridership and office demand, it adds up to \u201cgood news for the city\u2019s continuing economy recovery,\u201d he said.\nThere were 2.2 million square feet of office leased in San Francisco in the first quarter of 2025, according to early data from CBRE, slightly less than the fourth quarter of 2024 but 50 percent higher than the full first quarter of 2024. If San Francisco continues on this leasing trajectory, it will exceed the 8 million square feet leased in all of 2024, according to Colin Yasukochi, executive director of data for CBRE.\nThere were about 5 million square feet of office requirements in the first quarter, which is lower than previous quarters, but represents the highest level of company expansions since the pandemic at just over 20 percent of the total. Almost all of that demand is coming from the 30\nAI companies\nwhich are seeking a combined 1 million square feet of office space in the city, Yasukochi said.\nTwo AI firms sign leases at 501 Second Street\nThe Swig Company scored some of that coveted AI attention, announcing\ntwo leases\nwith AI firms this spring.\nLangChain, an open-source framework for building applications using large language models, is taking 11,800 square feet in the seven-story 200,000-square-foot former warehouse, while unitQ, an AI-enabled product quality and user experience analytics platform, has signed on for 7,500 square feet.\nBlake Walker and Caroline O\u2019Loughlin Livermore of CBRE represented LangChain. Walker said LangChain would be moving into a furnished space, which \u201cminimized disruption\u201d so they could focus on their business and give their team \u201can office they enjoy coming into.\u201d\n\u201cThe decision to move to 501 Second Street was driven by favorable economics, term flexibility, and a high-quality workspace that supports their growing team,\u201d he said.\nCory Kristoff, Swig\u2019s director of leasing, said in a statement that the company was happy to welcome \u201ctwo San Francisco-based enterprises advancing the application of artificial intelligence in business\u201d and that it looked forward to \u201csupporting their future growth.\u201d\nDistress at SF\u2019s biggest apartment complex\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t all good news for the city this week. San Francisco\u2019s largest apartment complex, Parkmerced,\nwent into receivership\nafter owner Maximus Real Estate Partners defaulted on nearly $1.8 billion in loans.\nA court appointed the San Diego-based Douglas Wilson Companies to serve as a receiver for the 152-acre, 3,221-unit complex at 3711 19th Avenue, south of San Francisco State University.\nDouglas Wilson, founder of his eponymously named company, said its goal will be to safeguard Parkmerced and work toward its \u201crepositioning.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been lacking capital for some time,\u201d Wilson told the Business Journal. The company is considering bringing in a new property management firm.\nMaximus had proposed redeveloping the World War II-era garden apartments by adding 5,700 homes, 230,000 square feet of shops and restaurants, 80,000 square feet of offices and a 64,000-square-foot community center.\nAlthough redevelopment plans were approved in 2011, and\nnew renderings put out\nin 2022, the project never broke ground, with Maximus founder Rob Rosania citing \u201csky-high construction costs, inflation and supply chain issues.\u201d\nMajor overhaul of Jay Paul\u2019s CityView plans\nIn the South Bay, Jay Paul Company announced a\nnew plan\nfor its CityView development in downtown San Jose, swapping out some office buildings for an office-to-residential conversion, a brand new residential tower and retail.\nOriginally plans called for three 19-story, interconnected office towers containing 3.4 million square feet of offices, shops and restaurants. The company\nasked the city for a five-year pause\non that plan last year, citing \u201ccurrent financial markets and a reduced demand for office leasing.\u201d\nNow downtown San Jose\u2019s biggest office owner is moving forward, but with a new vision for a mixed-use community with a large residential component, plus office, retail and restaurants, according to a news release from the company.\n\u201cDemand for older Class B and C office space at this site has declined, while the need for housing in San Jose continues to grow,\u201d company President Jay Paul told\nThe Real Deal.\n\u201cRight now, multifamily development is delivering stronger returns than aging office properties, making residential conversion an attractive proposition.\u201d\nIn a statement, San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan called the project \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d for its ability to help the city \u201creimagine what the capital of Silicon Valley looks and feels like in the age of AI.\u201d\n",

Or the mostly vegetarian grub at the once-anticipated food court nearby.\nSaluhall, a food hall anchored by an\n87,000-square-foot IKEA store\nat 945 Market Street, has sputtered,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported\n.\nNearly a year ago, the two-story food court\nopened\nto great fanfare, with\n11 vendors\ndishing out mostly vegan and vegetarian fare.\nOnly seven will soon be left.\nDownstairs, Saluhall has closed two of its proprietary food outlets. Upstairs, two independents are moving out, leaving two unfilled vacancies, according to the Chronicle.\nThe problem: a lack of business, Raul Medina, the chef-owner of Taqueria La Venganza, who recently\nannounced\nhis vegan taqueria would be pulling out, told the Chronicle. \u201cWe hardly made money this year,\u201d he said.\nSaluhall, with one new vendor in the works, has placed all its hopes on a public relations push \u2014 hiring locally based AF&amp;Co to promote the food court.\nIdeas include ads highlighting individual vendors. Or events like college basketball championship watch parties. Painting parties featuring drinks. Collaborations with the nearby Warfield Theater. Or its \u201cdrag bingo brunch\u201d and a Monday trivia night.\nToo little, too late, Medina said. \u201cThe things they\u2019re doing now are things they should have done since the beginning,\u201d he told the Chronicle.\nSaluhall, planned before the pandemic by IKEA\u2019s parent company and real estate arm, Ingka Centres, drew heavy hopes for a downtown revival, where\n37 percent\nof the city\u2019s offices are dark. As\nThe Real Deal\nreported, San Francisco had\n47.5 percent fewer\noffice visits last month, compared to February 2019, before the pandemic.\n\nDining options spotlighted vegan dishes, developed in a partnership with the cofounder of famed restaurant Noma. Some of those original vendors are gone, replaced by others.\nSaluhall management did not provide any specific visitor counts, which it measures by footfall counters and other data services.\nKayma owners Mounir Bahloul and his wife Wafa take turns serving Algerian dishes like shakshuka, spiced fries and bowls of couscous.\nLike Medina, Bahloul said the first couple of months looked promising. But come summer, hype over the new buzzy food hall died down. Sales slowed to a crawl. \u201cCompared to that high point, my sales are down 70 percent,\u201d Bahloul told the Chronicle.\nBahloul partially laid the blame on poor public safety in Mid-Market, which has driven pedestrians away from the hall. Even if there is security inside, he feels it makes no difference if there isn\u2019t a critical mass of customers. \u201cIf there\u2019s no foot traffic, there\u2019s no sales,\u201d he said.\nA month after the food hall opened in April, Ingka Centres emailed San Francisco police and the nonprofit Urban Alchemy to complain about dire street conditions around IKEA, specifically near the garage.\n\u201cVisitors are refusing to park in our building because of Stevenson Street conditions. This is also resulting in loss revenue daily,\u201d the Ingka Centres representative wrote, citing damage to exit doors from urine and feces, as well as alleged arson and trespassing.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also had incidents where people are refusing to move for vehicles to drive as well as people completely on drugs sleeping in the middle of the road.\u201d\nA slew of stores across San Francisco have closed, citing street conditions. A year after it opened a flagship store in Mid-Market, Whole Foods closed its doors in Mid-Market to\nprotect the safety\nof its employees.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "Alexandria Real Estate Equities has revealed how it wants to turn a 54-year-old indoor mall in San Bruno into a life sciences research village with 1,000 homes.\nThe Pasadena-based life sciences developer unveiled plans to redevelop the 44-acre Shops at Tanforan mall at 1122 El Camino Real,\nthe San Francisco Business Times reported\n.\nThe real estate investment trust plans to raze the nearly 970,000-square-foot mall and replace it with 1.8 million square feet of tech and life sciences research offices and 1,000 homes.\nIf approved, the project could turn the area into a high-density, transit hub \u2014 with three life sciences buildings built within a retail village of shops and restaurants, a revamped movie theater, a public market, a 63,000-square-foot Target department store, homes and open space.\nA Tanforan Central Market, with soaring walls of glass, sits under a shed roof next to a verdant glade full of residents and visitors, according to a rendering.\nOf its 1,000 homes, 200 would be set aside as affordable. Alexandria is working with Strada Investment Group, a San Francisco-based developer, which has entered talks with two affordable housing developers. Strada expects to select a partner this year.\nIn early 2022, Alexandria\nbought the mall\nfor\n$328 million, or $338 per square foot\n, according to the San Jose Mercury News. Its days as a traditional mall may be numbered.\nThe redevelopment project, now under environmental review, could be approved by November, with mall demolition to follow. Alexandria is still sketching out its retail plans.\n\nWhat was once known as the Tanforan Park Shopping Center opened in 1971 with two anchor stores, replacing a historic race track used as an internment camp for Japanese Americans during World War II.\nIn January, anchor JCPenney announced it would\nclose its 275,400-square-foot anchor store\n, accelerating its redevelopment.\nSan Bruno sees Tanforan\u2019s redevelopment as a way to bring jobs and housing to a key corridor. The city must plan for 3,100 new homes by 2031.\nThe mall\u2019s location next to the San Bruno BART station makes it an ideal site for workforce housing for teachers and other workers. Many lower-income workers in the county struggle to afford housing, forcing them into long commutes, according to city officials.\nThe life sciences component may be more of a gamble. The life science sector is coming out of a four-year slump, with only\nthree properties trading hands\nnationwide in the first nine months of last year.\nIn the quarter ending in June, the Bay Area\u2019s once-booming 41.5 million-square-foot life sciences market was\n24.6 percent vacant\n, according to CBRE.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "A South Financial District office building is heading to foreclosure after its Marin County-based landlord defaulted on a $21 million loan on the property last year, according to court filings.\nJonathan Parker, a principal of Monahan Parker, told\nThe Real Deal\nhe still hopes to hang on to the six-story, nearly 70,000-square-foot building.\nParker said he has presented the servicer \u2014 Beacon Default Management, formerly known as Rialto Capital \u2014 with \u201cmultiple offers from third-party buyers at or above the loan amount, as well as loan extension proposals wherein we would maintain ownership.\u201d\nBut those efforts have all been rejected by the lender, U.S. Bank National Association, due to additional interest and default fees that the CMBS bondholders have been unwilling to renegotiate, he said.\nThe total amount owed, including interest and fees, is $24.7 million, according to a foreclosure notice filed on Feb. 25. The owners have 90 days from the filing before a foreclosure sale can take place.\nEfforts to \u201cresolve the purchase or refinancing of the property are ongoing,\u201d Parker said.\nBeacon referred comment to legal counsel for the lender, which said in a statement that it is \u201ccommitted to engaging with borrowers to find the best possible resolutions. At the same time, we expect these sophisticated commercial borrowers to honor the commitments they have made.\u201d\n\nMarin-based Monahan Parker is a partnership between Parker, who is also a filmmaker, and Tom Monahan, president of Monahan Pacific, which owns office, residential and mixed-use properties, primarily in San Francisco and Marin.\nParker, through his land-use attorney, said that he was the minority owner in the building, and that it represented \u201cone of hundreds of buildings in San Francisco that is a victim of the work-from-home trend.\u201d The city only recently\ngot out of last place\nfor return-to-office figures, according to cell phone data analyzed by Placer.ai.\nMonahan Parker bought the 1907 building, which was expanded in 1925, for $11 million in 1998. Built in the aftermath of the 1906 quake, it had been vacant since it was damaged by the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989. After a major seismic retrofit and new interior finishes that wrapped up in 2000, the owners took out a $21 million interest-only loan with Natixis Real Estate Capital, a subsidiary of French bank Groupe BPCE, in 2013, according to loan documents. That loan was then packaged with others into a commercial mortgage-backed security pool in 2014. At the time, the property was 100 percent occupied and worth $34 million, or about $400 per square foot.\nBut by March last year, the value\nhad dropped to $20.7 million\n, according to Morningstar analysis. The most recent appraisal from the end of August shows an even lower value of $16.3 million. Interestingly, as of Sept. 30, 2024, the property was 92 percent occupied, according to Morningstar, after holding steady at 71 percent from the end of 2022 to the end of 2023.\nA Cushman &amp; Wakefield marketing site for the property shows two available suites: the entire 11,200-square-foot second floor, which is asking for $60 to $64 per square foot annually, and half of the ground floor, which does not have an asking rent listed. If those listings are up to date, that would put the property at about 78 percent occupancy.\nAverage asking rents in the South Financial District were $78.54 in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to Colliers data, and the neighborhood was showing an availability rate of 32.1 percent. That\u2019s a slightly lower availability rate than the city\u2019s 35.5 percent overall rate, and a slightly higher asking rent than the overall average of just under $70.\n",

        "content": "A Houston-based developer cleared a major hurdle in its plan to convert a struggling office building into apartments in northwest San Antonio.\nSan Antonio City Council unanimously approved a zoning change last week allowing Woodbranch Management to redevelop one of two office properties at 8401 Datapoint Drive, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n. The approval enables the firm to build 60 residential units per acre at Highpoint One, while Highpoint Two will stay office space. The site spans 13.5 acres, according to city documents. The planned number of units and construction costs haven\u2019t been disclosed.\nWoodbranch acquired the site in 2023 after the previous owner\u2019s bankruptcy left Capital One searching for a buyer to recover $53 million in debts. Woodbranch ultimately secured the property as its ground lease owner.\nCity staff recommended denying the zoning change, but the Zoning Commission pushed it forward, as the council has shown willingness to be flexible in increasing housing density citywide.\nThe project will bring needed housing to the San Antonio Medical Center, said council member and mayoral candidate Manny Pelaez, whose district includes the site.\nThe council\u2019s vote set development restrictions, capping new structures behind Highpoint One at six stories and limiting heights near neighboring condos to minimize impact.\n\nA construction timeline hasn\u2019t been disclosed.\nState lawmakers are considering legislation that would\ntoss rezoning requirements\nfor commercial properties to be converted into housing. The proposal by Sen. Bryan Hughes would apply to municipalities within the 13 Texas counties that have populations exceeding 420,000, along with cities within those counties that have over 60,000 residents.\nThis project is one of a few office-to-residential developments planned in San Antonio.

Jeffers &amp; Company, to redevelop the 31-story Tower Life building at 310 South St. Mary\u2019s Street with 243 mixed-income apartments. The 95-year-old building, designed by Ayres &amp; Ayres, will have retail space at the River Walk level.\nThe office-to-residential conversion trend has legs, especially in cities where demand for housing is rising and older office spaces are getting left behind. Developers increasingly view conversions as financially viable solutions to address the surplus of vacant office properties and the ongoing housing crisis, with nearly 71,000 units in the\noffice-to-resi conversion pipeline nationwide\n. However, it\u2019s not a silver bullet, as not all office buildings are suitable for conversion due to structural limitations and potential high costs of conversion.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

        "content": "The Irving City Council approved a zoning change for Las Vegas Sands\u2019 proposed resort near the former Texas Stadium site Thursday, but without the casino or nightclub elements that drew public backlash.\nIn back-to-back 6-3 votes, the council passed a version of the proposal stripped of gambling and nightlife uses after Sands\u2019 request to remove those elements just hours before the meeting, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nThe decision follows\npublic outcry and heated planning meetings\n, including one in late February, when the proposal first went before the City Council and more than 170 residents signed up to speak, most in opposition.\nSands executive Mark Boekenheide, who oversees the company\u2019s global real estate, told council members the company wasn\u2019t walking away from the project \u2014 but that\nwithout legalized gambling in Texas\n, a full $4 billion casino resort wasn\u2019t financially viable.\nSands might still pursue hotel development on the 182-acre site, which the company acquired last year, Boekenheide said.\nThe resort project previously included plans for a 15,000-seat arena expected to serve the Dallas Mavericks, which is co-owned by Sands\u2019\nrecently elevated CEO Patrick Dumont\n, along with hotels, retail, restaurants and entertainment venues.\n\nCritics of the project raised concerns about gambling addiction, public safety and the impact on the city\u2019s family-friendly character. Representatives from the University of Dallas, whose campus borders the proposed site, were among those opposing the plan.\nSome council members voiced frustration that Irving continues to lose major development opportunities. The council ultimately stopped short of banning gambling from the zoning ordinance entirely, leaving the door open for it to return if gambling is legalized in Texas.\nThe revised approval sets the stage for Sands to build a non-gaming resort in Irving, though whether the company moves forward without casino revenue remains an open question.\nTo add gambling back into the plan in the future, the zoning would need an amendment. More crucially for the original project plan\u2019s viability, a statewide vote on a constitutional amendment is required to legalize casino gaming in Texas.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

White Lodging, which owns 11 other Austin hotels, is marketing its portfolio for multi-venue bookings to try to fill that gap.\n\nThe renovation will focus on the hotel lobby, bar and restaurant. Dripping Springs-based firm Nuvu Interiors ATX is the designer. The hotel is home to Corner Restaurant, which features Southern cuisine, and Dean\u2019s Italian Steakhouse.\nThe hotel is just two blocks from the Austin Convention Center and features more than 120,000 square feet of meeting space. The hotel claims to offer the largest guest rooms in the city and includes amenities like an on-site spa and a rooftop pool with views of Lady Bird Lake.\nIn addition to the renovation, White Lodging is adding to its Austin portfolio with Hotel Trinity, an Autograph Collection hotel it\u2019s developing in partnership with REI Real Estate. The 13-floor, 258-key property will be located at Trinity Street and East Fifth Street, also near the convention center.\nDespite adding nearly 16,000 rooms between 2016 and 2022, Austin\u2019s hospitality market is thriving, with an occupancy rate of 67.4 percent, ConnectCRE reported, citing data from Marcus &amp; Millichap. The market also saw a 4 percent increase in average daily rate for luxury hotels.\n",

The asking price pencils out to $786 per square foot.\nThe 10,800-square-foot home sits on a little under an acre in the Tall Timbers section of River Oaks, just north of the Highland Village shopping center.\nMike Mahlstedt of Compass Real Estate listed the property, while Laura Sweeney, also with Compass, represented the buyer. The buyer and seller weren\u2019t identified.\nDesigned by Eubanks Group, the residence features European architectural elements, including loggias, gardens and terraces. The interior showcases centuries-old reclaimed materials, such as antique doors, a 17th-century double-faced stone fireplace, reclaimed terra cotta tile floors, antique wood beams and imported limestone flooring, according to the listing. The home underwent renovations in 2022 and 2023.\n\nAmenities include a pool, pavilion with an outdoor kitchen and dining area, and a three-car garage with guest quarters above. The home has five to six bedrooms, six full bathrooms, and two half-baths.\nAnother home among the top 10 most expensive sales this month was 4018 Meadow Lake Lane, located just across the street from 19 West Lane. Mahlstedt also listed that home, which was priced at $3.09 million and sold for between $2.87 million and $3.31 million.\nThe luxury market in Houston is thriving, and demand for\nhigh-rise condos\nis evident with developments like the St. Regis and Ritz-Carlton branded condo projects underway. Despite challenges such as fewer high-end listings and competition from Dallas, the ultra-luxury segment has shown resilience, with home sales over $10 million surging significantly.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

However, the distinctive and highly visible mushroom house, built in 1997 and designed by Dallas architect Tom Workman, isn\u2019t of great concern to preservationists.\nWhile it does have architectural value, its modern style and exposure on an arterial street make it less viable for preservation.\nRather, they are more interested in preserving the 1920s Tudor-style home on Bordeaux, designed by architect Hal Thomson.\nMany historically and architecturally significant homes have been demolished in Highland Park over the past two decades, but even the wealthiest Dallasites don\u2019t always get their way.\nBillionaire banker Andrew Beal demolished Highland Park\u2019s historic Cox Mansion, but he put his request for rezoning to build a five-story house\non hold\nafter pushback from community members who feared it would set a precedent.\n\nCar dealership owners are frequent buyers of luxury real estate and often have second lives in commercial real estate.

Its owner, tied to Houston-based Kalkan Capital, has not made a payment on the $54 million loan since June. The complex entered special servicing for loan default in October.\nThe lender is dual-tracking foreclosure, simultaneously pursuing a foreclosure process while continuing negotiations with the borrower, according to servicer commentary cited by Morningstar.\nKalkan Capital, founded by Fercan Kalkan, has been connected to other distressed multifamily properties, including the Village at Piney Point, where it faced\na $73 million foreclosure attempt\nfrom Fannie Mae in August. That case was delayed after a minority equity partner sued to block the sale, accusing the lender of \u201cmanufactured technical defaults\u201d to force a takeover.\n\nKalkan was also connected to a group of assets involved in a $384 million foreclosure auction last November.\nThe extent of the storm-related damage to Palm Beach Estates is unclear; the servicer noted that capital repairs are underway.\nThe property, a Class-C complex built in 1976, was one of many Houston multifamily properties affected by the severe weather last year, which caused widespread power outages, fallen trees and property damage.\nThe U.S. multifamily distress rate is second only to office properties, according to Cred iQ, as elevated interest rates and rising insurance costs squeeze landlords \u2014 especially in storm-prone regions like Houston.\nOthers still have struggled to recover after declines in occupancy and rental rates in Houston\u2019s multifamily market, recently including New York-based Nord Group, whose $38 million loan backed by La Solera Apartments in the southwest Houston suburb of Alief was\nsent to special servicing\nin February.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "The owner of the last penthouse to sell at 520 Park Avenue is having buyer\u2019s remorse.\nThe buyer, identified as Park Ave. Condo LLC, filed a lawsuit against the property\u2019s developers, William Lie Zeckendorf and Arthur Zeckendorf, after purchasing Unit DP-PH-63 for\n$78.9 million in November\n.\nThe buyer claimed that the Zeckendorfs knew of an impending skyscraper that was \u201call but certain to ruin the Penthouse\u2019s unobstructed Central Park view, the unit\u2019s defining feature.\u201d\nThe offending skyscraper comes from Extell Development\u2019s Gary Barnett,\nwho bought three 60th Street lots from Solil Management\nfor $103 million earlier this month. The assemblage is next to 655 Madison Avenue, where Extell had already\nplanned a 62-unit residential tower and commercial space\n.\nThe buyer alleges in the complaint that Extell and Solil had made \u201csecret plans\u201d to develop a skyscraper that covers the entire assemblage and \u201cwill tower over 520 Park Avenue.\u201d\nDesperate times\nThe buyer alleged that the Zeckendorfs were privy to this non-public information because of \u201ctheir status as part of a small circle of New York City real estate insiders,\u201d and did not disclose it because of their desperation to offload the penthouse at a good price.\n\nThe complaint cites the Zeckendorfs\u2019 failed efforts to sell a\nformer triplex in the building\n\u2014 which was later subdivided into the duplex \u2014 for $130 million, and the years the resulting duplex spent on the market as the motivation to sell the penthouse at the maximum possible price.\nThe complaint also references the Zeckendorfs\u2019\nlawsuit against Los Angeles Angels owner Arte Moreno\n, who backed out of buying a unit at 520 Park Avenue, as evidence of the developers\u2019 \u201cdesperation\u201d to sell other units in the building.\nThe offering plan does disclose that west-facing windows on apartments, including the original triplex, are \u201cconsidered amenities that can potentially be lost,\u201d and also includes a general disclosure that \u201cno representation is made that future construction in the neighborhood surrounding the Property will not result in obstruction of views.\u201d\nBut the buyer claimed that none of the 26 amendments to the plan included a disclosure suggesting the west-facing windows faced a \u201cspecific, existing risk of obstruction.\u201d\nThe buyer is suing the Zeckendorfs for fraud and is seeking to rescind the sale, in addition to any other potential damages.\nA representative for the Zeckendorfs and lawyers for the buyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

The firm is buying 24 acres near 1500 South Riverfront Boulevard, just outside of downtown, with plans to build an $800 million resort. The seller was Lewisville-based development firm Matthews Southwest.\nTherme expects to spend $500 million on construction and $300 million on design fees and interest.\nIt still has to get planning and zoning approval from the city; it also plans to apply for incentives. The resort could generate $1.8 billion in tax revenues over the next 30 years and would create more than 1,000 permanent jobs, Therme US\u2019s John Alschuler told the outlet.\nThe Dallas location could open as early as 2030.\nIt will include a 450,000-square-foot facility with baths, saunas, a waterpark and restaurants. Georgetown Company owns a 25 percent stake in Therme US and plans to build a hotel on the site, too.\n\nAlschuler said day passes at the facility would cost about $60.\nCedars neighborhood association president Kirk Jordan visited Therme\u2019s Bucharest facility and has voiced support for the project, which he said would be \u201ctransformative\u201d for the area.\nTherme recently announced plans for a similar resort in Washington, D.C. It already operates two facilities, in Romania and Germany.\nThe land buy comes less than a year after the\nopening\nof WorldSprings, a 10-acre outdoor resort with 46 mineral pools. The $32 million facility is located in the Colony.\nNorth Texas has become a hotspot for experiential developments, with the $520 million PGA Omni Frisco leading the charge. Peppa Pig Theme Park recently opened in North Richland Hills. Universal Kids Resort is on deck to open next year in Frisco. Wisconsin-based Kalahari Resorts &amp; Conventions announced plans for an Allen waterpark resort earlier this year.\n",

CBRE will also oversee the office buildout.\nGranite Park 6 was completed in 2023, and the lease brings it to 58 percent occupied. It features amenities such as a market caf\u00e9, fitness studio, golf simulator and conference centers. The 422,000-square-foot building has recently attracted five companies, including a major insurance brokerage and Atlantic Aviation, totaling 126,000 square feet in new leases.\nSimpson Strong-Tie\u2019s decision to establish a second headquarters in Collin County was influenced by the area\u2019s strong labor market and proximity to its manufacturing facility in McKinney. Its office will house key departments and function as a co-headquarters alongside its base in Pleasanton, California. The company aims to relocate 55 office employees by the fourth quarter and plans to expand its local workforce to 300 employees over the next decade.\n\nThe Plano City Council is set to vote today on an $800,000 economic development incentives agreement supporting the company\u2019s move. The proposed deal requires the company to occupy at least 38,130 square feet, employ 50 local workers, and complete $5.3 million in renovations by December 1.\nPlano\u2019s youthful office market is benefiting from the flight-to-quality trend of employers exiting older office buildings for amenity-filled new construction or renovated spaces.\nRecent leasing deals include Sally Beauty\u2019s\nheadquarters relocation\nto 140,000 square feet at 7900 Windrose Avenue in Plano\u2019s Legacy West.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

        "content": "The owners of a Soho penthouse are suing Tal Alexander and Official Partners for allegedly defrauding them of roughly $400,000.\nThe lawsuit, filed in New York on Monday, accuses the former top agent, the brokerage he co-founded and his client, entrepreneur Daniel Fine, of lying about Fine\u2019s finances and deceiving the owners into renting their apartment at 54 Thompson Street to him.\nThe lease \u201cwas and continues to be a con-job disaster,\u201d the complaint states.\n\u201cOur client was shocked to discover that the then-respected Official Partners had conspired against its own client in order to gain a commission,\u201d Christopher Milito, an attorney for the plaintiff, wrote in a statement. \u201cOur client was defrauded and damaged by this group of unprincipled individuals.\u201d\nThe lawsuit adds to a growing list of complaints against Alexander and his brothers, Oren and Alon Alexander, who have been in custody since their arrest on\nfederal sex trafficking charge\ns in December. Along with dozens of civil sexual assault claims against the brothers, Tal and Oren, who co-founded Official, are\nfacing a lawsuit\nfrom the backer of their company, white-label firm Side, over an allegedly unpaid loan.\nIn the complaint, the plaintiff \u2014 an entity that appears to be tied to a mortgage firm executive \u2014 claims Alexander and Fine \u201clied, falsified bank documents and covered each other\u2019s bad acts\u201d to present Fine as a reliable renter.\nHowever, once the lease began, the complaint alleges Fine \u201cimmediately failed\u201d to meet the $45,000 per month rent and utility charges, racking up a six-figure outstanding balance. It accuses Fine of renting out the space for parties and for allowing others to sublet the unit.\nThe lease, which Fine signed through his company, FineCo, is in place until May 2026.\n\u201cIt does not appear that Fine ever resided in the apartment himself, as was the understanding,\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys wrote. \u201cInstead, FineCo and Fine have used the apartment to generate income for themselves without paying Plaintiff its justly-due rent.\u201d\nFine and attorneys representing Alexander and Official Partners did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe duplex penthouse last traded in 2021 for $12.3 million to an LLC linked to Tri Minh Nguyen, CEO of Network Capital, and Hung Nguyen, according to mortgage documents filed in the city register.\nAbout two years after buying the apartment, the owners started searching for a renter for the property, initially seeking $60,000 a month when it hit the market in April 2023, according to a Streeteasy listing.\nThe property history shows the owners tapped Official Partners, including Alexander and Nicholas Lounsbury, a former Official agent and defendant in the lawsuit, to find a tenant last March, though the complaint states they were hired the year prior. The complaint accuses Alexander and the brokerage of doing \u201clittle to market the apartment to the general public.\u201d\n\nInstead, court documents state Alexander offered Fine, described as a friend and in similar social circles, as a prospective tenant. Among the application materials submitted by Fine was a bank statement from JP Morgan showing he had more than $4 million in his account.\nThe owners claim they voiced concerns about Fine\u2019s credit score and his reported businesses.\n\u201cThe \u2018medical app\u2019 in Fine\u2019s biography appeared to be an iPhone app touting itself as a \u2018Cannabis Cooking Calculator\u2019 for \u2018Perfectly dosed edibles.\u2019 SetScale appeared to be a small, internet-based factoring lender,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cAnd a 710 credit score for the intended occupant of a $45,000 a month apartment was unusual.\u201d\nThe owners allege Alexander and Lounsbury instead pushed them to focus on the bank statement, which proved Fine had enough cash to meet the hefty rent.\nNow, they\u2019re claiming that document was forged, and that Alexander and Lounsbury knew it was a fake.\n\u201cDespite the knowledge of the fake Account Statement, Alexander, Lounsbury and Official urged Plaintiff to rely on it as evidence of FineCo\u2019s ability to pay rent for the Apartment,\u201d the complaint states. The defendants \u201curged this reliance in order to earn a leasing commission, which was paid by Plaintiff to Official.\u201d\nThe lawsuit, which seeks more than $150,000 in damages, includes allegations of fraud, aiding and abetting fraud and breach of contract.\nLounsbury did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nAfter a decade at Douglas Elliman, Tal and Oren co-founded Official with three other partners in 2022. The firm quickly cemented itself as one of the leading brokerages in luxury markets such as New York and South Florida and later\nexpanded to the West Coast\nand\nAspen, Colorado\n.\nThe firm\u2019s early success halted last summer, after\nThe Real Deal\nfirst reported on sexual assault allegations levied against Tal, Oren and Alon. Tal and Oren initially stepped back from their roles at Official, but later\ntook control of the brokerage\nafter their co-founders exited.\n\nMost, if not all, of Official\u2019s agents have since left the firm, which is likely not operating, as Oren and Tal have been in a Brooklyn federal jail since earlier this year.\nSide sued Official and the Alexanders\nlast year, alleging they failed to pay back a $5 million loan it provided for them to launch their business. A California judge issued a temporary injunction barring the brothers from offloading or concealing assets used to collateralize the loan, a move the brothers are appealing.\nTal, Oren and Alon\u2019s federal sex trafficking trial is slated to begin in January 2026. Oren and Alon are also\nfacing state charges\nin Miami-Dade County; that trial could start as early as May.",

        "content": "Miami-Dade\u2019s housing czar Alex Ballina is leaving his government post to cash in on demand for affordable and workforce developments across the Sunshine State,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nHe recently formed Florida Development Building Group, or FDBG, a firm that will use \u201cdata driven insights and data-backed strategies to focus on projects for essential workers in underserved markets throughout Florida,\u201d Ballina told\nTRD\n. He will step down as director of Miami-Dade Housing and Community Development next month.\n\u201cI did a great job at the county, but the timing is right to go do my own thing,\u201d Ballina said. \u201cI know the blueprint for doing these types of projects.\u201d\nFDBG will focus primarily on workforce housing projects that take advantage of Florida\u2019s\nLive Local Act\n, Ballina said. The state law incentivizes developers with density and height increases, tax breaks and other sweeteners if they designate a portion or all of their residential units in a project for affordable and workforce housing. Local governments are required to administratively approve Live Local projects.\nIn a memo on Monday to the county commission, Miami-Dade Mayor\nDaniella Levine Cava\nannounced the departure of Ballina and Miami-Dade Innovation and Economic Development Chief Francesca de Quesada. Levine Cava did not provide any further explanation about their reasons for leaving.\n\nNathan Kogon, the housing department\u2019s assistant director, will lead the county agency on an interim basis while Levine Cava\u2019s administration conducts a search for a new permanent chief, the mayor\u2019s memo states. Her spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\u201cWe are going to miss Alex,\u201d said county commissioner Elieen Higgins, whose district includes downtown Miami and Brickell. \u201cBut I think we are in good hands with Nathan.\u201d\nBallina accepted the county housing director job in 2023 after working 11 years as an executive for\nResia\n, a Miami-based multifamily development firm. Prior to Resia, Ballina was an assistant director for the Miami-Dade housing department, overseeing maintenance and upkeep for housing complexes.\nWhen he took on the top job, Ballina replaced Michael Liu, a former federal housing official who was hired in 2014 to run Miami-Dade Housing and Community Development. Liu resigned eight years later after clashing with Levine Cava, and he now works as a strategic adviser for Coconut Grove-based developer\nMichael Swerdlow\n.\nUnder Ballina\u2019s watch, the county housing department \u2014 in\u00a0 partnership with developers \u2014 completed more than 25 affordable and workforce housing projects with over 6,000 units, Ballina said. \u201cWe reorganized and streamlined a lot of our processes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe catapulted development of affordable housing and unlocked a lot of stuck deals.\u201d",

        "content": "Sales of several $30 million-plus Atherton homes by the same builder \u2014 Pacific Peninsula Group \u2014 may \u201creset the ceiling\u201d for the nation\u2019s most expensive zip code, according to luxury San Francisco Peninsula agents.\nOn Feb. 18, Atherton notched its first $30 million-plus sale recorded in the multiple listing service for 2025: 112 Almendral Ave sold for $33.5 million to Amberhill Trust, according to the deed. It was a custom built by Pacific Peninsula Group for the previous owner, former Altera CEO John Daane, after he and his wife Linda bought the 1-acre parcel for $8 million in 2018, according to deed records and city permits.\nCompass agents Mary and Brent Gullixson listed the property and did not confirm the identity of the buyer or the seller, but Brent said that the custom home\u2019s high price speaks to \u201cthe buyer\u2019s desire to buy a new home in order to avoid the time it takes to build.\u201d\n\u201cWith such a low number of new homes in the pipeline, prices for new construction have reached a new high,\u201d he added.\nAt the end of last year, Pacific Peninsula Group quietly sold 358 Walsh Road for $36 million, according to San Mateo County records, the biggest sale in the infamously expensive community in 2024 and close to an all-time Atherton record. The buyer was 358 Walsh LLC, a Delaware-based entity.\nThe developer was also behind the sale of another $30 million-plus Atherton build \u2014 63 Santiago, which sold for $32.4 million in October to Santiago Avenue LLC, another Delaware-based entity.\nPacific Peninsula Group did not respond to emails and calls for comment. At both the Santiago and the Walsh properties, the buyers\u2019 agents and identities are unknown.\nThe current record for a single residential sale in Atherton reported to the MLS is\n233 Park Lane\n, which sold for $40 million in 2023 and was built by Pacific Peninsula Group for the owners, who ended up selling it with everything included down to the linens. Gap co-founder Doris Fisher also sold two parcels of her long-time Atherton estate\nfor a combined $48 million\nto one buyer in 2024.\nPacific Peninsula Group\nbought a different 2-acre parcel of the Fisher estate\nfor $15 million last year as well. Permits to demolish the existing residence were approved before the property even closed escrow. Permits for a new main residence, pool house and detached garage were approved in August.\n\nMichael Repka of DeLeon Realty represented the seller on the Park Lane sale as well as the seller in a 2023 deal where Pacific Peninsula Group bought a 2.5-acre estate for $25 million and said the company understands the formula for building houses that ultra-luxury buyers want, with strong resale value.\n\u201cPPG is an exceptional builder, but they are also exceptional business men,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are consistently able to command a premium over builders that are less in touch with the market.\u201d\nSales like these \u201creset the ceiling\u201d in the Atherton luxury market, he added.\n\u201cOnce you have a few high-priced sales of this nature it is easier to get others to fall into that price range,\u201d he said.\nCompass agent Omar Maissen, the co-listing agent on\nAtherton\u2019s most expensive listing\n, agreed that a few very high-end sales can help move the needle on the market because they help buyers feel like $30-plus-million prices are reasonable.\n\u201cBuyers seek the comfort of knowing they are not the first to the dance and this provides a great springboard to boost confidence in the market,\u201d Maissen said of the recent Pacific Peninsula Group sales.\nRepka said, in general, the Atherton market has seen a \u201cdramatic uptick\u201d in activity from international buyers in the ultra-high end, especially Chinese buyers. This includes buyers from Hong Kong and mainland China, he said, though they typically already have a presence in Atherton and are looking for move-up properties.\nCompass agent Tom LeMieux said the Peninsula had a relatively flat year overall in 2024, especially compared to the run-up in prices during the pandemic. But the upper end of the market, spurred by international buyers and the tech sector, has been seeing more sales. In 2023, he said, the only sale over $30 million in Atherton was the Park Lane sale. But in 2024, there were six, he said, including the ones on Santiago and Walsh.\n\u201cFor some of these very choice areas or these larger lot opportunities or, in the case of 358 Walsh, these newer, highly amenitized homes, it does speak to the demand we have for that in our market recently,\u201d LeMieux said.\n",

        "content": "Rent-stabilized distress, long tied to local banks, is now hitting CMBS.\nThe impact underscores that pains are radiating, exposing a new crop of investors to potential losses.\nIn the past two years, the distress rate for securitized New York multifamily loans has more than doubled to 14.4 percent, according to Kroll Bond Rating Agency data recently reported by Trepp\u2019s CRE Direct. Distress, per Kroll\u2019s definition, designates a delinquency or special servicing stay.\nNotably, 90 percent of the $1.8 billion in New York multifamily debt is tied to properties subject to some sort of rent restriction, according to CRE Direct.\nThe distress rate for apartment properties built before 1974 \u2014 when most rent-regulated units came online \u2014 is 25 percent, further highlighting the ties between rent stabilization and financial trouble.\nCitywide, rent-regulated buildings have suffered since the 2019 rent law severely suppressed revenues. To make matters worse, inflation and rising interest rates stoked expenses.\nNow, more owners are failing to fend off delinquencies and defaults. Some have succumbed to the struggle, selling off assets at\nincredible discounts\nor trying to toss keys back to lenders\nrefusing to play catch\n.\n\nBut as the downtrend crystallized, it was largely New York City bank lenders bearing the blow: Signature Bank failed, New York Community Bank narrowly avoided collapse and NYCB\u2019s recent rebrand, Flagstar Financial, is still\nscrambling to cut\nor cure its\nrent-stabilized debt\n.\nData showing rent-regulated CMBS deals are struggling signals the wider crisis isn\u2019t just a mom-and-pop problem. The big dogs that lean on securitized debt are suffering, too.\nThe $540 million senior mortgage tied to Meyer Chetrit\u2019s\nYorkshire and Lexington Towers\nat 305 East 86th Street and 160 East 88th Street, respectively, is one example.\nThe buildings, which are\u00a0a little less than half rent-stabilized, landed in special servicing last year after Chetrit and co-owner Stellar Management made a series of late payments.\nThe loan was marked current in March by Morningstar Credit. The deal\u2019s cash flow, however, cannot cover its total debt, which includes about $175 million in mezzanine financing.\nThe sponsors bought the buildings in 2014 and planned to renovate the overwhelming majority of their rent-stabilized units, aiming to boost rents by 20 percent, according to CRE Direct.\nThe 2019 rent law decimated such strategies.\n",

The home was\noriginally listed for $55 million\nin 2022 before going through a series of price chops until its last asking price of $37 million, at which point it was taken off the market last summer.\nThe co-op, which is feet from Central Park, has five bedrooms, multiple wood-burning fireplaces and a dining room that seats 30. The couple, who bought into the building in 2004 for $25 million, renovated the apartment with the help of French designer Robert Couturier.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Serena Boardman and Maria Bazo had the listing.\nThe buyers appear to be Rajaram Rao and his wife Anjuli Rao. In 2006, Rajaram founded infrastructure investment firm Global Infrastructure Partners, which was acquired by Blackrock in exchange for $3 billion in cash and 12 million shares.\n\nThe initial asking price may have been trying to take advantage of a historic sale that took place in the building just months prior, when a pair of co-ops owned by Paul Allen, the late Microsoft co-founder,\nsold for $101 million\n, the most expensive co-op transaction in New York history.\nJulia Koch, wife of the late billionaire David Koch, was the buyer of the two homes.\nThe discounted sale continues a string of co-ops in high-profile buildings unable to hit their initial asking price.\nKoch herself sold her\n18-room co-op at 740 Park Avenue for $45 million\n, a 25 percent discount from the reported $60 million she sought back in 2022.\nGrace Hightower, the ex-wife of Robert De Niro, didn\u2019t even try and make a profit on her co-op at 88 Central Park West, listing it for $20 million last year, slightly under the $20.9 million she and her former husband paid for it in 2006. The\napartment sold for $18 million\nin March.\n",

The $500-plus million phase one calls for 500 workforce housing units and 500 student housing beds in two eight-story buildings, new basketball courts, a turf field and academic facilities.\nMiami-based Kobi Karp Architecture &amp; Interior Design is expected to design the project.\nIncluding future phases, the project could exceed well over $1 billion, Burstyn said.\nMcCormick called the deal with Redwood a P3-plus, which he described as an enhanced public-private partnership centered around a ground lease with Redwood.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new model,\u201d McCormick said. \u201cWe want to be able to replicate this, and help universities replicate this.\u201d\n\nThe university was \u201cwiped of its debt years ago when Trump was in office,\u201d Burstyn said, referring to the CARES Act, which\ngave $1 billion\nto Historically Black Colleges and Universities and minority-serving institutions.\nConstruction could begin next year. Burstyn said each building would take about 18 to 24 months to construct.\nNew academic facilities will boost FMU\u2019s biology, music and cybersecurity training programs, according to a press release. McCormick plans to increase enrollment to more than 2,000 students, up from the current 1,300.\nMcCormick said providing affordable housing for professors, teachers and staff will help the university recruit, and offering more housing for students will boost enrollment. Since the pandemic, South Florida has become one of the\nmost unaffordable housing markets\nin the country.\n\u201cWe interview great people for key positions, but the relocation, they can\u2019t afford it, even on a great salary,\u201d he said.\nRedwood will handle the financial and development aspects of the deal. Burstyn said the arrangement is similar to its\nredevelopment\nof the Claude Pepper Park property in North Miami, which is a public-private partnership with the city.

The buyer was a joint venture between Terranova and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investing.\nAcadia joins a wave of institutional investors and real estate firms scooping up South Florida shopping centers.

One firm from Oakland promised a complimentary dinner at the Pasadena Hilton.\nBut nowhere is the stampede more apparent than on social media.\n\u201cWe are here to help,\u201d one firm\u2019s Instagram ad said.\n\u201cYou may be entitled to compensation,\u201d said another ad from an L.A. ambulance chaser.\n\u201cStart your 30-second eligibility quiz,\u201d said a Florida-based marketing agency, Legal Claim Assistant, which doesn\u2019t even list an attorney associated with it.\nJennifer Gray Thompson, CEO of After the Fire USA, a nonprofit that has worked in Lahaina, Paradise and other communities ravaged by wildfire, pointed out the potential exploitation.\n\n\u201cThe ick is real, and it feels very predatory,\u201d she told the Times. \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s a feeding frenzy off of people\u2019s trauma and suffering.\u201d\nBillions of dollars could be on the line for those who lost homes, businesses or loved ones in the flames.\nPacific Gas &amp; Electric paid a settlement\nof cash and stock valued at $13.5 billion to victims of the 2018 camp fire and other blazes. As part of negotiations for the landmark PG&amp;E payout, the state set up a fund in 2019 for future victims of fires caused by utilities, which now holds about $13 billion but can pay out up to $21 billion, according to the Times.\nWhether SoCal Edison sparked the Jan. 7 blaze remains to be confirmed by investigators. The\u00a0 county of L.A. and scores of Altadena residents have already sued the utility, accusing it of causing the inferno.\nCompany records uncovered by The Times\nshow that Edison knew some of its towers near the fire\u2019s epicenter were fire hazards.\nLawyers, who typically take no upfront cash, often require a one-third cut. The payout of a future settlement could be enormous.\nThe Eaton fire around Altadena destroyed\nmore than 9,400 structures\nand\nclaimed 17 lives\n. Its victims will battle the region\u2019s richest utilities, armed with an army of attorneys and savvy political operators.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of people who think this is a gold rush and are trying to sign up everyone and their brother,\u201d said John Manly, an Orange County lawyer known for representing sex abuse victims against USC, UCLA and the Catholic Church. \u201cThere are good firms advertising, and that\u2019s OK.\n\u201cBut when someone comes from Rhode Island and says, \u2018I\u2019ll do your wildfire case in California,\u2019 be suspect.\u201d\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "Stephen Ketchum\u2019s real estate debt fund has set its crosshairs on a suburban Chicago office deal gone wrong under the direction of landlord Stanton Road Capital.\nAn affiliate of Ketchum\u2019s New York-based firm Sound Point Capital sued this week to foreclose on a $19.9 million Deerfield office building loan to Stanton Road, the owner of\n1751 Lake Cook Road\nin the northern suburbs.\nThe landlord is a commercial property investment firm that owns several Chicago-area office buildings. Founded by Timothy Ronan, Stanton has offices in Southern California and Park City, Utah.\nSound Point\u2019s foreclosure filing splashes the 214,000-square-foot Lake Cook Road property into a deep pool of distressed suburban office assets, including several others in Deerfield and nearby suburbs that have similarly sunk deals involving the owners of major downtown Chicago buildings.\nWith vacancy rates exceeding 30 percent in suburban Chicago office and elevated interest rates eating into property values established before the pandemic, even some of the biggest names among commercial real estate investors have fallen into trouble with their lenders.\nThe Deerfield office is one of at least three Stanton owns in the Chicago area, with the others at\n200 South Michigan Avenue\nin the city and at 1933 West Butterfield Road in Downers Grove, a western suburb.\nWhile Stanton\u2019s ownership of those two properties remains intact, it\u2019s under threat in Deerfield, where Sound Point claims the landlord stopped making principal and interest payments in January on its nearly $20 million loan originated in 2018.\n\nThat was when Stanton paid previous owner James Campbell Company $18.7 million for the property, with the extra $1.2 million in debt it took on beyond the purchase price from Sound Point likely meant to cover renovations and leasing costs, such as broker commissions and tenant improvement allowances.\nRonan and other Stanton leaders didn\u2019t return a request for comment, and a lawyer for Sound Point declined to comment.\nIn addition to Stanton\u2019s alleged default triggered by missed loan payments starting early this year, Colliers has filed a lien for more than $289,000 claiming that it has gone unpaid for property management services it\u2019s performed at the property.\nThere\u2019s also a Colliers lien of more than $229,000 filed in 2023 against the Stanton entity that owns 200 South Michigan in Chicago that also appears unresolved, public records show.\nAmong the other foreclosure lawsuits targeting Deerfield office buildings is embattled investor\nShaya Prager\u2019s Opal Holdings\n, which is facing a lender\u2019s attempt to strip its ownership of the Corporate 500 office campus on Lake Cook Road for allegedly defaulting on a $106 million loan against the property.\nElsewhere, Chicago-based\nBaum Realty Group\u2019s David Baum\nis linked to the buyer of a distressed loan note for a Deerfield office building facing foreclosure that\u2019s owned by Ameritus, owner of a Wacker Drive office tower. And in nearby Bannockburn, the Larry Krueger-led\nWanxiang America Real Estate\n\u2014 an owner and investor in several huge Chicago properties \u2014 is facing a foreclosure of a 134,000-square-foot building burdened by a $15 million loan with a $12 million remaining balance.\n",

        "content": "Longfellow Real Estate Partners and PGIM have spun a roulette wheel around plans to build an 84-acre life sciences workspace hub in Redwood City, betting on a market rebound within five years.\nThe Boston-based developer and New Jersey-based investor filed revised plans to\u00a0 redevelop the 84-acre office campus at 800-3800 Bridge Parkway and 900-1300 Island Drive, in Redwood Shores,\nthe San Francisco Business Times reported\n.\nThe developers drew up slightly smaller plans for the project known as Redwood Life: Evolve, calling for 2.8 million square feet of life science offices and research labs, with more open space between surrounding neighborhoods. The wider buffer was created in response to local opposition.\nThe life sciences market, faced with a glut of offices and labs and diminished funding, has been fighting to emerge from a\nfour-year slump\nthat led biotech companies to cut thousands of jobs, shed real estate and crimp their drug development pipelines.\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s read the headlines about the supply and demand of life sciences in the Bay Area, but we are very bullish,\u201d Peter Fritz, managing director of Longfellow, told the outlet. \u201cThis is a compromise with the community.\u201d\nThe previous plan, designed by St. Louis-based HOK Group, called for 13 buildings from 55 feet to 100 feet tall with\n3.1 million square feet of offices across 90 acres\nalong the Belmont Slough.\nThe new plan\u2019s environmental review is expected to proceed through next year. Pending approvals, the project would likely break ground in five years, executives say. The project was to include a 104-room hotel, a 46,000-square-foot conference center with a food court and outdoor terrace, and 47 acres of green belts, parks, amphitheaters, athletic courts, lawns and gardens.\nParking garages beneath the buildings would serve more than 7,000 cars.\n\nIt was to replace a campus, built during the 1990s, containing 20 two-story, cookie-cutter buildings with 1 million square feet of offices surrounded by parking lots north of the Redwood Shores Lagoon. It\u2019s home to such life science firms as Nevro, Procept BioRobotics and Jasper Therapeutics.\nIt\u2019s not clear if the latest plans by Longfellow and PGIM, the investment management arm of Prudential Financial, include the hotel and conference center.\nThe vacancy for life sciences properties across the Bay Area in December hovered around 29 percent, nearly four times higher than five years ago, according to market research by the Business Times.\nJoel Marcus, founder of major life science landlord Alexandria Real Estate, recently told Wall Street analysts that government approvals for new drugs, vaccines and treatments remain strong \u2014 a positive sign for biotech firms and life sciences projects.\nFritz, of Longfellow, also remains upbeat about the industry\u2019s long-term potential.\n\u201cThis hiccup has been a capital markets challenge,\u201d he told the Business Times. \u201cThe innovation never stopped. We are still in the early days of biomedical research.\u201d\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "A former AT&amp;T corporate dormitory complex in Irving could soon be demolished to make way for a high-end multifamily development, marking another major transformation in the city\u2019s real estate landscape.\nChicago-based Amli Residential requested a zoning change to redevelop the 13-acre site at 6201 Colwell Boulevard. The proposal includes 406 units spread across six apartment buildings and four townhome-style structures. Irving City Council is expected to vote on the request next month.\nThe site, adjacent to Dallas-based AT&amp;T\u2019s Advanced Education Center, houses 304 dorm-style units across 12 three-story buildings, along with a pool, tennis courts and a basketball court. AT&amp;T vacated the property in 2023 and intends to sell it to Amli. Details of the deal haven\u2019t been disclosed.\nThe site sits across from the 290-acre former Exxon Mobil headquarters, which Austin-based office investor Capital Commercial Investments\nbought in 2023\nwith plans to attract another corporate headquarters.\n\nAmli\u2019s plans for the community include a sports court, pocket parks and a 4,000-square-foot clubhouse. The project would expand the firm\u2019s Dallas-Fort Worth portfolio, which includes 12 apartment complexes. The developer is also undertaking a major project in Addison, where it is replacing the\nMidway Square Shopping Center\nwith a 570-unit apartment complex.\nFounded in 1980, Amli Residential is owned by Prime Property Fund, a real estate investment vehicle managed by Morgan Stanley. If approved, the Irving project would continue the trend of converting outdated corporate sites into modern residential hubs, catering to the region\u2019s demand for rental housing.\nPopulation growth and economic development are driving demand for apartments in DFW. Historic deliveries since the pandemic leveled the playing field between landlords and renters, with many complexes offering rent concessions. However, development is easing up, and analysts are expecting rent growth to kick back up in the next couple of years.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

        "content": "A data center development is in the works on Chicago\u2019s Near South Side, as Lincolnshire-based developer Scott Greenberg moves forward with adaptive reuse plans on land he\u2019s owned since 2020.\nThe $40 million privately funded project will transform a truck-trailer parking lot site at 2500-2540 South Wabash Avenue into a 76,000-square-foot data center catering to research institutions, universities and government agencies, Block Club\nreported\n.\nThe two-story facility was previously zoned for a 108,000-square-foot esports stadium, but\nGreenberg\u2019s $30 million plan for that fell through\n. Greenberg has owned the land eyed for the data center since 2020, when he paid a total of nearly $7 million across two different transactions for the properties.\nThe increasing demand for data centers is driven by the rapid growth of artificial intelligence and cloud storage needs, which require substantial computing power and infrastructure.\nChicago has 94 data centers, including Digital Realty\u2019s massive South Loop center. However, data center expansions have faced pushback from residents concerned about noise and environmental impact. They use massive amounts of power and clean drinking water.\nThe data center story is different in\nrural Illinois\n, though, where municipalities and residents are more likely to trade negative environmental impacts for jobs and property tax revenues.\n\nGreenberg\u2019s data center redevelopment will include seven backup generators enclosed in noise-reducing housing and a high fence for privacy.\nGreenberg also owns nearby production studio SMASH Virtual at 2617 South Wabash, and aims to integrate community amenities into the data center project. Plans include a 1,500-square-foot coffee shop on the ground floor, which will be offered to a tenant at cost, with no base rent, to encourage a local business presence.\nThe project, led by Gensler Architects, Terra Engineering, Power Construction and Thorton Tomasetti, is expected to employ 15-20 people.\nA construction start date has not been set, but the project has an estimated 18-month completion timeline.\nGreenberg is a longtime Chicago-area real estate player whose holdings also include the 310-key hotel at\n201 North State Street\nin the Loop.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

        "content": "Bob Myers, the ESPN analyst and former general manager of the Golden State Warriors, has sold his Presidio Heights home for $12.6 million, according to public records showing a closing date of March 14.\nMyers and wife Kristen bought the 6,300-square-foot six-bedroom, four-bath and two half-bath home at 200 Laurel Street in April 2016 for $10.275 million, more than $1 million over its $9 million asking price, according to property records and listing notes from the time.\nThe turn-of-the-century Queen Anne Victorian had been renovated by the previous owners shortly before they sold to the Myers, but it still maintains \u201ctimeless architectural elegance\u201d with \u201csoaring ceilings, intricate millwork\u201d and grand public rooms, according to the listing notes from Sotheby\u2019s International agent Janet Schindler.\nSchindler declined to comment on the sale, citing a non-disclosure agreement. She listed the home for $12.9 million on January 22 and it was in contract on February 21, according to Redfin.\nMyers, who grew up in the Bay Area, was the GM for the Warriors from 2012 to 2023, during a stretch in which the team won four NBA championships and he was twice voted NBA Executive of the Year. He was also the Warriors\u2019 President of Basketball Operations for the last seven years of his tenure.\nWhen he stepped down, he told ESPN, \u201cIt\u2019s just time.\u201d ESPN announced he would be joining its \u201cNBA Countdown\u201d pre-game show as an analyst later that year, a role he served again during the 2024-2025 basketball season. Last year he also became a consultant for the NFL\u2019s Washington Commanders.\n\nThe buyer was Mapache Listo LLC, which was represented by Tyler Stewart of Heath Real Estate.\nStewart declined to name her clients, citing security and privacy concerns, but said that they already had a home in Presidio Heights and a very narrow area that they were looking at for a larger home amid extremely limited inventory.\n\u201cIn this specific location, which is essentially a four-block radius, you get maybe one house a year,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when those houses come up, it is obviously a very lovely home, but it\u2019s really location driven.\u201d\nThe buyers also liked that the property is located on a corner lot and has big windows to let in a lot of light, Stewart said. Even though the last renovation took place ten years ago, she said they weren\u2019t planning on doing work. There was competition on the home, she said, but ending up at a price of $2,000 per square foot is \u201caverage for this sort of home in this location, so I think they felt really good about that.\u201d\nThough this house sold quickly at near asking, Tyler said there\u2019s been \u201ca little bit of turbulence\u201d in the market this spring because of the uncertainty in the national geopolitical and economic situation. Buyers are out there, but are also a lot pickier than they were during the height of the pandemic market in 2021 when \u201cif it had an address, it sold.\u201d That means she\u2019s written offers for hundreds of thousands over the asking price on homes that had eight offers on them this spring, while other properties are just sitting.\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that there\u2019s a steady trend going on right now,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems to be way more property-specific.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Four years later, the lien sale is back.\nNearly one year ago, with very little fanfare, the City Council reauthorized the controversial program through 2028.\nThe next one is slated for May 20, the first since December 2021.*\nFor the uninitiated: Properties end up in the lien sale when they have long-overdue property taxes and/or water and sewer bills. This debt is sold to a private trust, and then the trust can move to foreclose if the owner is not ultimately able to pay up.\nWhen the Council reauthorized the sale, it also made several changes to it, including creating the \u201cEasy Exit\u201d program, which allows certain one- to three-unit and condo building owners to have their property removed from the lien sale up to three times within 36 months. Owners can also opt for foreclosure and have their property transferred to an approved nonprofit. In those cases, the owner is guaranteed a 99-year affordable lease in the building.\nThe City Council is still trying to figure out how to revive another controversial but defunct program:\nThird Party Transfer\n. TPT hands over delinquent and distressed properties to a temporary owner who prepares them for sale, at which point they are converted to affordable housing.\nDuring a budget hearing on Tuesday, Bronx Council member Pierina Ana Sanchez stressed the importance of reviving the program.\nSanchez\nproposed\na bill to reform the program last year, but the Council and the Department of Housing Preservation and Development are still negotiating what the new version of TPT will look like.\n*H/t to Brick Underground for first\nspotting\nthe date for the next lien sale.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nAre you working on or considering any Universal Affordability Preference projects?\nSend a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: We knew this was coming, but the City Council\u2019s conservative Common Sense Caucus and other groups are filing a lawsuit challenging the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, alleging the text amendment violates city and state environmental review laws.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\n\u2014\nCouncil member Justin Brannan, who is running for City Comptroller, wants the city to divest from Tesla Holdings,\nGothamist reports\n. The investment is worth an estimated $1.2 billion. \u201cElon Musk is coming for us,\u201d Brannan told Gothamist. \u201cWhy should we be investing retirees\u2019 hard-earned pension funds in a guy who\u2019s already shown that he\u2019s got New York City in the crosshairs?\u201d\n\u2014\nThe city\u2019s Administration for Children\u2019s Services says it needs $1 billion in state funding to keep a program running that provides free or discounted childcare for tens of thousands of New Yorkers\n,\nthe New York Times reports\n. The state budget is due April 1, and the city agency says that an extended delay in its passing could result in vouchers going unfunded. The agency currently subsidizes more than 60,000 vouchers using state funding.\n\u2014\nA former senior prosecutor says that Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, who asked a federal judge to dismiss charges against Mayor Eric Adams, told another prosecutor to shred notes taken during a meeting about the possibility of dropping charges against the mayor,\nReuters reports\n. Former Manhattan U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon, who resigned rather than seek a dismissal of Adams\u2019 case, emailed herself a draft letter to Bove that detailed her reasons for resigning and mentioned his shredding directive. The email became public in court filings on Tuesday. Bove denied that he had instructed any materials to be shredded.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Tuesday was\n$37 million\nfor a roughly 7,000-square-foot co-op unit at 4 East 66th Street in Lenox Hill.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$13.4 million\nfor a 133,765-square-foot, 145-unit residential apartment building at 9704 Fourth Avenue in Bay Ridge.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$19 million\nfor a 5,000-square-foot townhouse at 246 West 12th Street in the West Village. Christopher Riccio and Elana Zinoman of Douglas Elliman have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 40,260-square-foot, nine-story, 51-unit residential building at 449 Jackson Avenue in North New York. Nikolai Katz filed the permit on behalf of Hershy Silberstein of Blue Shine Builders.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "State fire officials have released the first fire hazard maps for Southern California in 14 years, outlining where wildfires are most likely to occur in the coming decades.\nThe maps, published Monday, come after the ashes have cooled on the January wildfires around the Pacific Palisades and Altadena, which burned more than 12,000 homes, highlighting the urgency of wildfire preparedness,\nthe Los Angeles Daily News reported\n.\nThe maps, developed by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Cal Fire, project the probability of wildfires across eight counties over the next 30 to 50 years.\nThey also indicate where stricter fire-resistant building codes apply and where residents must adhere to brush clearance regulations. Local governments can use the maps to guide planning decisions.\n\u201cI see them as an educational tool to let people know the potential hazards in an area,\u201d Brad Weisshaupt, assistant fire chief for Los Angeles County, told reporters from the Orange County Register and Riverside Press-Enteprise. \u201c[It can] help inform decisions when working on their house and what they plant around their house.\u201d\nThe maps cover parts of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Imperial, Mono and Inyo counties, where local fire departments oversee fire protection. They supplement maps\nreleased earlier this year for Northern\nand Central California.\nCompared to the previous maps, released between 2007 and 2011, the new versions categorize areas into three fire hazard levels: moderate, high and very-high. These classifications are based on factors such as vegetation, terrain, fire history and local weather conditions.\n\nHomeowners in high and very-high fire zones will face increased responsibilities.\nState building codes require fire-resistant roofs, double-pane windows and ember-resistant vents in newly constructed homes. Landscaping rules mandate the maintenance of \u201cdefensible space\u201d within 100 feet of structures, with strict vegetation control within 30 feet.\nSome communities, including Los Angeles and Orange counties, conduct annual brush inspections, with non-compliance resulting in fines of up to $500.\nAdditionally, real estate laws require sellers to disclose if a property is in a high-risk fire zone and confirm compliance with defensible space regulations. The state Board of Forestry is also drafting new regulations to create an ember-free \u201cZone 0\u201d within 5 feet of structures, prohibiting flammable materials like wooden gates and bark mulch.\nThe revised maps show a statewide increase in high-risk fire zones, to 1.4 million acres from 800,000 acres. However, insurance rates are unlikely to be affected, as most insurers rely on their own risk assessments.\nOfficials hope the updates will enhance wildfire awareness and encourage proactive measures to mitigate fire risks.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "Tiao Properties has won a lawsuit seeking to force the East Los Angeles Planning Commission to reverse a successful appeal to block a 50-unit apartment complex in Boyle Heights.\nA court backed the Silverlake-based developer, which fought to overcome the appeal against the six-story building at 2115-2123 Cesar E. Chavez Avenue,\nUrbanize Los Angeles reported\n.\nThe court judgment forces the commission to reject the appeal and reapprove the project during a hearing slated for\nApril 9\n.\nIn 2021, the company led by Will and Diana Tiao filed plans to build the 56,000-square-foot apartment building with 4,000 square feet of ground-floor shops and an underground parking garage,\nThe Real Deal reported\n.\nTiao aimed to implement incentives for Transit Oriented Communities \u2014 places that are designed to make it more convenient to take transit than to drive\n\u2014\nto construct a larger building than zoning rules allow in exchange for five affordable apartments set aside for extremely low-income households.\nThe project, approved by the planning commission in 2023, would replace a 115-year-old apartment building with sidewalk storefronts. An affiliate of Will Tiao bought the three-unit, rent-controlled building in early 2020 for $2.1 million.\nThe brown and gray building, designed by West Adams-based Bittoni Architects, would contain vertical windows, with inset balconies on its upper four floors, with floor-to-ceiling windows below, according to a rendering.\nA year ago this month, however, the planning commission\nvoted 3-2\nto grant an appeal blocking the new apartment building at Cesar E. Chavez and North Chicago Street, near bus stops and the Soto/Cesar E. Chavez Metro station.\n\nThe appeal, filed by tenants of the building slated to be bulldozed, argued the project was inconsistent with zoning rules and the California Environmental Quality Act. It said the project had been approved without sufficient community input, and without enough affordable housing.\nPlanning staff had recommended the commission deny the appeal, pointing to state law allowing little discretion on such multifamily development.\nBut a majority of commissioners ultimately voted to grant the appeal, thus overturning the project\u2019s prior approval.\nThe reason: an uptick in evictions after the end of pandemic renter protections, plus an alleged lack of consideration to gentrification, displacement and mental health impacts,\nLA Public Press reported\n. The Tiaos then sued to overturn the decision.\nThe decision to reverse the planning commission appeal is the second such ruling by the courts, according to Urbanize.\nIn late 2020, a Los Angeles judge ordered the South Los Angeles Area Planning Commission\nto rescind its decision to block construction of the District Square project\n, which called for building more than 500 apartments near Metro\u2019s Expo/Crenshaw Station.\nTiao Properties, founded in 2012, manages $125 million in assets, including 200 apartment units, according to its website.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "Brookfield Properties won approval from the Northbrook Village Board to begin residential construction at Northbrook Court before tackling the struggling mall\u2019s retail overhaul.\nVillage trustees permitted mixed-use redevelopment and amended an economic incentive agreement, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nThe amount of the economic incentive Brookfield is set to receive hasn\u2019t been disclosed; it was reported in 2018 that the developers sought $27 million in incentives, including $21.5 million in tax increment financing and $5.5 million in sales tax rebates, for a $250 million project. The most recent documents indicate the village has agreed to provide financing through TIF and business district revenues.\nHigh interest rates and economic factors have made operating regional malls like Northbrook Court challenging. High demand for suburban multifamily, on the other hand, has led to rent growth and a competitive investment market, and construction lending for apartments is less difficult.\nBrookfield\u2019s redevelopment plan includes a mix of apartments, row houses and townhomes, designed to meet shifting market demands.The earliest construction could start would be summer 2026.\n\nNorthbrook Court is part of Brookfield\u2019s broader strategy to transform underperforming retail spaces into mixed-use developments. The Northbrook project aims to incorporate residential units, commercial spaces and community amenities, reflecting a shift in focus from traditional retail to more integrated community environments. Brookfield\u2019s similar initiatives include the\nStonestown Galleria\nin San Francisco, where it plans to add thousands of homes and commercial spaces.\nNorthbrook first approved the redevelopment agreement with Brookfield affiliates in 2023, establishing a TIF district and a business district to spur a revamp of the 100-acre property at 1515 Lake Cook Road. However, financial incentives tied to the deal will only be activated once retail development begins, said Amy McEwan, Northbrook\u2019s director of development and planning services.\n\u201cWe safeguarded the agreement, ensuring developers must lease at least 50 percent of retail space before accessing incentives,\u201d said village president Kathryn Ciesla.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

With the purchase, Blox became the lender and completed the foreclosure, according to the Mercury News.\nThe $6.8 million Blox paid to buy the loan is 81.7 percent below the most recently available assessed value for the building, according to the newspaper.\nThe Class A office building, built in 1988 next to the Public Market Emeryville food court, is 60 percent occupied. It was revamped in 2017, according to LoopNet.\n\nBlox sees plenty of potential in the Emeryville market.\n\u201cEmeryville is a leading innovation hub in the Bay Area,\u201d Jason Oberman, CEO of Blox Ventures, said at the time the Blox affiliate bought the loan for the building.\n\u201cWith global leaders like Pixar Animation Studios, Bayer and Novartis, along with the area\u2019s expanding residential offerings, the long-term potential of this property is very promising.\u201d\nThe deal joins other\nEast Bay office properties\nselling for a fraction of what they were once worth following a pandemic shift to remote work, resulting in high vacancy. With higher interest rates and refinancing costs, many landlords have struggled to keep their buildings.\nThis fall, Lakeside Group and Rubicon Point Partners\nacquired a 15-story, 279,700-square-foot building and parking garage\nat 180 Grand Avenue, near Downtown Oakland, through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, after buying its loan for $30.2 million, or $108 per square foot.\nBlox Ventures, founded by Oberman in 2015, owns more than 6 million square feet of commercial real estate valued at more than $3 billion across the Bay Area and in Salt Lake City, Utah, according to its website and the San Francisco Business Times.\nIn 2018, Blox and New York-basedAngelo Gordon\nbought a 58,000-square-foot commercial complex\nof offices, shops and a long-vacant supermarket in Palo Alto for $78.3 million. They leased out the market space and flipped it two years later for $103.6 million, 32 percent more than its last traded price.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "The Witkoff Group and Cammeby\u2019s International Group refinanced the office portion of the famed Woolworth Building in Lower Manhattan.\nBlackstone Group provided a $278.9 million loan at 233 Broadway, PincusCo\nreported\n. The loan breaks down to $358 per square foot.\nThe transaction closed earlier this month. The debt replaced a previous $256 million issued in 2015, also by Blackstone.\nNone of the parties involved immediately responded to a request for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n. The entire debt of the property is $301.6 million, according to Traded.\nSteve Witkoff and Ruby Schron purchased the entirety of the Woolworth Building in 1998 for $137.5 million. In 2012, an investment group led by Alchemy Properties purchased the top 30 floors of the 60-story building for $68 million and proceeded to create luxury condos, which were not involved in the refinancing.\n\nA portion of the office condo\u2019s debt was included in a CMBS deal in the fall of 2020, providing\na peek at the building\u2019s performance\n. As of July 2020, the office condo was 92 percent leased to 84 tenants, up from 79 percent leased in 2015. The largest tenant at the time was New York University, which utilized 94,000 square feet for its School of Professional Studies, as well as administrative offices.\nLast month, tenants signed deals\ncovering 1.25 million square feet\nin Downtown Manhattan alone, according to a Colliers report, representing the district\u2019s highest monthly leasing volume since December 2019.\n\u201cDowntown leasing has sort of been the exception to the uptick we\u2019ve seen in demand over the last several quarters,\u201d said Colliers\u2019 Franklin Wallach, one of the authors of the report.\nA Blackstone-led venture is in the midst of\ntrying to sell\ncommercial debt once held by Signature Bank, at least its third attempt to sell loans from the stake.

        "content": "Westside luxury agent Jacqueline Chernov and a portion of her team have jumped to\nThe Beverly Hills Estates\nas the boutique brokerage looks to grow its presence in the Pacific Palisades post-wildfires\nChernov, who previously affiliated with Compass, was part of a team of agents representing spec developer Yaniv Nehemia on last year\u2019s\nrecord-breaking Pacific Palisades sale\nof 538 Chautauqua Boulevard for $32.3 million. Compass\u2019 David Berg, F. Ron Smith and Kristin Alexander were also part of the listing team. The deal was the neighborhood\u2019s priciest sale on record in more than a year.\n\u201cI wanted to make a change and I had a good opportunity to go to a smaller company because I prefer to be in a more boutique environment,\u201d Chernov said.\nFor The Beverly Hills Estates, Chernov\u2019s addition further bolsters its presence on the Westside and, more specifically, the Palisades, where she\u2019s guiding rebuilds for not only clients but herself, after losing two properties in January\u2019s fires.\nChernov team members Zoe Chernov, Max Chernov, Devin Harris and Stephanie Schembri joined The Beverly Hills Estates while Nicole Strober remains with Compass.\nAnother former team member, Anna Gera, moved on to Westside Estate Agency.\nMeanwhile, Jamielynn Storie will serve as the Chernov team\u2019s director of operations, while she stays with Compass as an agent.\nChernov and her team will be based in\nThe Beverly Hills Estates\n\u2019 West Hollywood headquarters on Sunset Boulevard. The brokerage is expanding its presence on the street, after taking over the building next door and is wrapping up renovations on the space.\nPalisades Rebuilding\nThe brokerage switch is one of several shakeups in recent months for Chernov.\nShe and her son lost their family home in the Palisades\u2019 Alphabet Streets, along with a property in the Huntington neighborhood. They bounced around to 10 different hotels and\nAirbnbs\nfor about six weeks after the Southern California\nwildfires began\n. She saw first-hand the price gouging from landlords, although didn\u2019t have the time to report anyone.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much going on right now just arguing with the insurance company on a daily basis and trying to rebuild the business,\u201d Chernov said. \u201cI was hoping some of the realtors I was friendly with would help [with the price gouging]. Not one did.\u201d\nShe plans to build back both homes, after selecting a builder and meeting with an architect.\n\u201cThe building process should be a year, but no one knows when you can start,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the tricky thing.\u201d\nChernov estimated two-thirds of her Palisades clients are planning on rebuilding. Those who are selling tend to be over the age of 65 or families with very young children not interested in investing the time to wait out permitting and construction.\nAs of Tuesday, there are 81 active land listings on the market in the Palisades, according to data provided by Amalfi Estates owner Anthony Marguleas. Another 17 lots are in escrow and seven have sold.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of potential in the Palisades right now,\u201d Chernov said. \u201cMy phone\u2019s ringing off the hook. I\u2019ve been to this point just helping clients navigate through whether or not they have the bandwidth to rebuild their properties.\u201d\nNow, she\u2019s added the role of developer headhunter to her resume. The roughly dozen spec developers she works with are pivoting from building for themselves to custom builds for clients. It\u2019s a learning process on both ends.\nIn some ways, Chernov\u2019s latest gig brings her back to where she always intended to be. In the early aughts she was studying interior design at the University of California, Los Angeles when a friend suggested she get into real estate. As a single mom with two kids, the work offered flexibility.\nChernov obtained her license in 2003 and started at Coldwell Banker Realty\u2019s Pacific Palisades office. A side hustle flipping homes with her son \u2014 they\u2019re currently working on one property in Mar Vista and another in Larchmont \u2014 exercises her interior design skills.\n\u201cI\u2019m finally doing what I wanted to do 20 years ago,\u201d Chernov said. \u201cWorking with builders helped me understand the process. I can read plans. Now, with the Palisades, all of a sudden, that\u2019s all it is right now: rebuilding.\u201d\n",

        "content": "More than 100 groups, City Council members, community board members and state lawmakers are asking a state court to annul the City of Yes, taking particular aim at the final rezoning that is expected to add 80,000 homes in New York over the next 15 years.\nA lawsuit filed in Staten Island state court on Wednesday alleges that the Adams administration violated city and state environmental laws by failing to do a comprehensive review of the impact of the zoning changes. Though the lawsuit is targeting City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, the legal team believes the other City of Yes zoning changes \u2014 City of Yes for Carbon Neutrality and City of Yes for Economic Opportunity \u2014 would be thrown out if the lawsuit succeeds.\nA City Hall representative said the administration stands by its review process.\n\u201cWhen it comes to housing, there will always be those who say, \u2018Not in my backyard,\u2019 but we stand by the city\u2019s thorough and transparent review process and will address any lawsuit when it is received,\u201d a City Hall spokesperson said in a statement.\nThe complaint seeks to undo City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, a text amendment that made several zoning changes to increase housing throughout the city, including eliminating parking minimums in some parts of the city, allowing more housing in areas near transit and legalizing some accessory dwelling units.\nBut the lawsuit is taking an even bigger swing: An attorney for the plaintiffs says if this lawsuit succeeds, the other two City of Yes zoning changes will also be annulled.\nThe members of the City Council\u2019s Common Sense Caucus, a group of Conservative City Council members who opposed the City of Yes, are named as plaintiffs in the suit. That includes Council members Robert Holden, Vickie Paladino, Joann Ariola and David Carr.\n\u201cThe City of Yes was never really about solving the economic or housing crisis,\u201d said Ariola, who is the Republican minority leader in the Council. \u201cIt was about clearing the decks for big developers to come into our communities and deceive us into thinking it would not have a negative impact on our communities or a negative environmental consequence.\u201d\nSpeakers at the sparsely-attended conference reiterated arguments that City of Yes for Housing Opportunity would lead to the Manhattan-ization of quiet, suburban neighborhoods in the outer boroughs. City leaders have argued that the zoning changes in the text amendment were modest and would lead to a little bit of housing in every district. Changes to low-density neighborhoods allowed three- to five-story apartment buildings near transit and two to four stories of housing above businesses.\nA spokesperson for the Real Estate Board of New York said, \u201creversing this plan would move New York City in the wrong direction by closing pathways to desperately needed new housing within all five boroughs.\u201d\n\nMany of the groups named are based in the outer boroughs, including the Queens Civic Congress, which is leading the suit. A few Manhattan and citywide organizations, including the Met Council on Housing and the Black Institute, are also listed as plaintiffs. Paul DiBenedetto, chair of Community Board 11 in Queens, is among the local community board members who have signed onto the lawsuit.\nThe complaint argues that the administration wrongly separated the zoning changes into three parts.\nThe result, according to the complaint, was to \u201ccover up and conceal the full environmental impacts of City of Yes.\u201d The three \u201cform one piece of an integrated and coordinated public policy overhaul\u201d and should have been considered together rather than presented separately to community boards, the lawsuit alleges.\nThe City Council\napproved\nCity of Yes in November, projecting that the zoning changes would lead to the construction of 80,000 units over the next 15 years, down from a projection that more than 100,000 would be built. The Council secured a number of changes to the proposal before signing off on it, including securing parking minimums in some parts of the city and a $5 billion commitment in public funding.\nEven with funding dedicated to improving local infrastructure, opponents argued that the new housing threatened to overwhelm water and sewer infrastructure.\nThe lawsuit alleges that the city didn\u2019t take a \u201chard look\u201d at how the changes under City of Yes for Housing Opportunity would affect many low-density districts. The city instead opted for a \u201cgeneric\u201d approach in its Environmental Impact Statement, studying \u201c28 prototypical sites and 14 representative neighborhoods.\u201d\nThat approach, as outlined in the city\u2019s environmental review law, is applied to \u201cprograms and plans that have wide application or affect the range of future alternative policies.\u201d\nThe groups also allege that the city failed to present any alternatives to the rezoning to \u201cavoid and reduce the serious and critical negative environmental impacts of City of Yes.\u201d\nA reversal of the rezoning, a signature policy for Mayor Eric Adams, would be a significant blow to an already troubled administration.\n",

        "content": "Douglas Elliman is out of a Section 8 discrimination fight aimed at several of its top producers.\nA federal judge last week dismissed the lawsuit against the firm and its New York City agents over alleged violations of the Fair Housing Act. The case was tossed with prejudice, which means the plaintiff, Shaniqua Newkirk, can\u2019t reopen or revive her claims in a future lawsuit.\nNewkirk, who is Black,\nsued Elliman\nand a number of its top agents \u2014 including Noble Black, Frances Katzen, Ann Cutbill Lenane and Lauren Muss \u2014 in 2023, alleging the luxury brokers either didn\u2019t help her find housing with her Section 8 voucher or didn\u2019t respond to her emailed requests to assist her.\n\u201cWe disagree with the Court\u2019s reasoning in dismissing the Compliant,\u201d Newkirk\u2019s attorney Andrew Miltenberg wrote in a statement. \u201cWe believe that there is a clear and compelling basis for the lawsuit\u00a0 and are considering our appellate options.\u201d\n\u201cWe are thrilled to see these predatory and baseless claims rejected by the court and that the well-earned reputations of our agents and our firm have been affirmed,\u201d said a spokesperson for Douglas Elliman. \u201cThe dismissal of this lawsuit underscores Douglas Elliman\u2019s zero-tolerance policy against any unlawful discrimination. We pride ourselves on our agent training programs, which include rigorous education on fair housing laws.\u201d\nThe decision to dismiss the case came after Newkirk and her attorneys failed to file an amended complaint despite two deadline extensions, according to court documents. The judge initially agreed to dismiss the case in December and allowed Newkirk time to submit a revised complaint. But her attorneys ultimately agreed to the dismissal last week.\nIn a letter to the judge, Newkirk\u2019s attorney Steven Siegel wrote that his research \u201cdid not find any authority to reinstate this cause of action\u201d considering the court\u2019s objections, including that Newkirk hadn\u2019t proved she sustained damages as a result of the allegations. He confirmed Newkirk initiated the case after the statute of limitations had run out for her claims.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Newkirk claimed she started reaching out to brokers on a list of the city\u2019s top agents in June 2021 to find someone to assist her in finding a new apartment with her voucher. Instead, Newkirk alleges her requests were\nbrushed off or went unanswered\n.\n\u201cI only specialize in luxury real estate transactions and don\u2019t even know what sec 8 means,\u201d\u00a0 Elliman agent Madeline Hult Elghanayan told the plaintiff in an email.\nOther agents named in the lawsuit included Eleonora Srugo, whose team recently starred in a Netflix\u2019s reality show called \u201cSelling the City.\u201d Disgraced brokers Tal and Oren Alexander, who left Elliman to launch their own company in 2022, were also named in the complaint.\nNewkirk\u2019s complaint also accused Elliman of violating city laws mandating it \u201cprominently and conspicuously\u201d include a link to the Fair Housing and Anti-Discrimination notice on the homepage of its website.\n\u201cOnly at the very end of the homepage in tiny font under the heading of State Disclosures is a link,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cDefendants are more concerned with their luxury brand than they are with following the law.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Elliman previously pushed back against the claims, calling them \u201cpredatory and baseless.\u201d The spokesperson argued the firm had a \u201czero tolerance policy\u201d for discrimination and maintained a \u201crigorous\u201d training program for agents around fair housing policies.\n",

KS joined the Astoria Cove project in September.\nKS plans to deliver more than 2,800 units across the three phases of the project, well above what Alma promised more than a decade ago; Alma Realty\u2019s Steve Valiotis and Cad3\u2019s Meyer Lebowitz \u2014 who was instrumental in bringing in KS \u2014 remain involved in the project, according to KS managing partner Daniel Spiegel.\nThe first phase of the revived development \u2014 greenlit by this new construction financing \u2014 involves four buildings with 736 apartments and 318 parking spaces. The 26-story residential tower and three mixed-use buildings will sprout at 25-02 Ninth Street and 4-34 26th Avenue.\nA 141-unit building has already been completed.\n\nKS is working towards a $95 million land deal for the development in the next year, as well as a $450 million construction loan for the second phase of the project that will build 1,000 additional units.\nThe third phase, for which the developer is hunting for another $450 million construction loan, will feature another 1,100 units.\nThe whole project will also have between 30,000 to 50,000 square feet of commercial space and a piazza on the East River.\nResidential amenities will include a rooftop pool, fitness center, golf simulator, children\u2019s playroom, indoor and outdoor cinemas and a business center. At least 30 percent of the residential units will be affordable since the project was financed under 421a.\nSpiegel estimates the overall price tag to exceed $2 billion.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s housing market has jogged at its own pace while other cities sprinted ahead since the turn of the century.\nThe city\u2019s home prices have doubled in the last 25 years, but that growth significantly lags home values of most major U.S. metro, according to the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nChicago\u2019s price index landed at just 211.23, placing it near the bottom of the 20-city list, while the national average has more than tripled since January 2000. Markets like Miami, San Diego and Los Angeles have seen prices quadruple since then.\nThe slower climb reflects strengths and weaknesses in Chicago\u2019s housing market.\nThe lack of a dramatic run-up means affordability is strong, making Chicago an attractive place to live even if it doesn\u2019t offer the same wealth gains as pricier coastal cities, said Karen Ranquist of Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\nThe market has shown resilience in the short term. Case-Shiller showed Chicago leading most major metros in year-over-year price growth in January, second only to New York. That strength reflects a more stable post-pandemic market compared to places like Phoenix and Tampa, where prices surged and then cooled rapidly.\n\nThe long-term lag is tied to deeper structural challenges. Population loss, slow economic growth and the lasting impact of the foreclosure crisis and pandemic downturns are drags on appreciation.\nLocal markets have also diverged. Historically disinvested areas like Bronzeville and Humboldt Park have seen substantial appreciation driven by reinvestment and redevelopment, while parts of South Cook County have struggled from the decline of industrial jobs.\nChicago\u2019s real estate story is more about stability than speculation despite the uneven gains, with steady demand and an improving outlook for this year.\nMore recently, Chicago home prices have leapt, outpacing inflation with a\n7 percent surge in mid-2024\nand the market remaining active at the start of the year.\nSellers began\ncutting prices earlier than usual\nthis winter as high interest rates and buyer caution tempered demand. Median asking prices hit $410,000 in February, marking a three-year high, and overall values remain 4 to 5 percent above last year\u2019s levels, suggesting pricing power hasn\u2019t vanished even as buyers grow more selective.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

It\u2019s not entirely clear what Torrisi paid for the home, but the property was on the market for $10.75 million before being pulled in July.\nThe seller was Robert McBride, a prominent lobbyist in the renewable energy, real estate and hospital sectors. He declined to comment on the all-cash deal, as did Torrisi.\nThe estate, which overlooks Fort Pond Bay, stretches across more than an acre and a half. The main home was built in 2008 and spans 7,600 square feet, complete with five bedrooms and seven-and-a-half bathrooms. Additional features include a tackle room, a gym, a wine cellar with a tasting room and a pool.\nTorrisi already owns a home in Montauk. In 2023, he told\nPenta\nthat his Montauk home was an escape from work, where he could surf, cook and enjoy an outdoor lifestyle.\nWork is certainly busy for Torrisi. Beyond owning impossible-to-nab reservation spots like Carbone and Torrisi, he and his partners, Jeff Zalaznick and Mario Carbone, are expanding their reach beyond food.\n\nAt the end of last year, Major Food Group broke ground on Villa Miami, a branded project being developed with Terra and One Thousand Group; the partners also secured a $285 million construction loan.\nThe 56-story, 70-unit condo building represents Major Food Group\u2019s\nfirst branded residential development\n. The hospitality group will brand Villa Miami\u2019s food and beverage venues, including branded dining at the private, multistory Copper Club.\nUnits will range from 3,000 square feet to 6,000 square feet, and prices will start at $5 million. Villa Miami is expected to be completed in 2027.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\nREAD MORE LINKS:\n",

Other tenants include Douglas Elliman and RealSource Group.\nLori and Mitch Junkins bought the building in 1996 for $2 million, or $106 per square foot. Last year, they sold it to a \u201crelated entity\u201d for an undisclosed price, according to the Business Journal.\nPlans call for bulldozing it to make way for an eight-story, 118,600-square-foot apartment building with four studio, 15 one-bedroom, 42 two-bedroom and 15 three-bedroom apartments atop an underground parking garage for 190 cars.\nTwelve apartments would be set aside as affordable, including six for low-income households and six for moderate-income tenants.\nJunkins wants to construct an 85-foot-tall building, and seeks a height waiver from local zoning rules that limit projects to 32 feet. It\u2019s not clear if she would employ local or state density bonus incentives.\nA cost and timeline for development were not disclosed.\n\nThe project, designed by Irvine-based MVE, is the latest in multifamily developments proposed in Newport Center, a hilltop commercial district founded by the Irvine Company around the Fashion Island mall.\nAcross from Newport Center, Dallas-based Park Newport LP has filed plans to expand its Park Newport Apartments by 366 units at 1 Park Newport at a cost of\n$800,000 a unit\n.\nThe Irvine Company recently filed plans to build 200 apartments at Villas of Fashion Island at 1000 San Joaquin Plaza and 600 apartments at 110 Newport Center Drive, also known as Block 100.\nThe firm also wants to convert part of an office campus at MacArthur Court near John Wayne Airport into\n700 homes\n.\nIn December, Irvine-based Related California pitched a plan to demolish a movieplex near Fashion Island\nto build 140 condominiums\nin two towers at 210 and 300 Newport Center Drive.\nSanta Ana-based Nexus Companies also debuted Vivante Newport Center, a 99-unit assisted living senior complex, which replaced the former Orange County Museum of Art. It includes a movie theater, golf simulator, bowling alley and spa.\nThe upscale coastal city has a state-mandated plan to build\n4,845 homes by 2029\n, of which 2,386 would be affordable for low- and very low-income households. Of those, half the homes are planned around Newport Center.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "It took six years, but the real estate industry finally got a chance to grill Andrew Cuomo about the 2019 law that crushed rent-stabilized building owners.\nThe opportunity came in a meeting with the Real Estate Board of New York that was private, but Cuomo\u2019s spokesperson later issued a\npublic statement\nabout it.\nWarning: It might make your head explode.\n\u201cWhile well-intentioned, the 2019 bill had unintended consequences in some places \u2014 specifically changes involving MCI and IAI repairs,\u201d said the longtime Cuomo loyalist, Rich Azzopardi. \u201cThere\u2019s been widespread acknowledgment of these issues, which subsequently were the subject of legislative tweaks.\u201d\nTo the uninformed, this makes it seem like the law included a few innocent mistakes that were repaired. But owners of rent-stabilized buildings know better.\nThe tenant activists who literally wrote the law on behalf of Senate and Assembly leaders knew exactly what the consequences would be, as would anyone with even a passing knowledge of rent stabilization.\nFar from unintended, the consequences were deliberate. Let\u2019s give a rundown of the reality.\nAbout those IAIs, or individual apartment improvements: Even state legislators are not so stupid to think apartments can be renovated for $15,000, which is the amount they allowed landlords to recover through temporary rent increases.\nEven more damaging to old buildings, the lawmakers ended the 20 percent rent increase that had been allowed after a tenancy ended.\nThey figured landlords would swallow the extra cost rather than let apartments sit vacant. They were wrong. If the renovation expense is high and the legal rent is low, the math doesn\u2019t work. As it stands now, tens of thousands of rent-regulated units\nremain vacant\n.\nSimilarly, major capital improvements, or MCIs, cost far more than landlords were allowed to recover from tenants.\nThe \u201ctweaks\u201d passed several years later were barely better than nothing.\nCuomo should have prevented this from happening, but instead removed himself from the negotiations for reasons he never explained. The truth is that he had allegedly reached out to tenant activists, apparently seeking political cover for a compromise bill, but they\nrefused to meet with him\n\u2014 confident they could pass something without him. The governor, a famous control freak, had lost control of the process.\n\nAt that point, he made a disingenuous promise \u2014 a dare, really \u2014 that he would sign whatever state legislators put on his desk. And when the law passed, he had to live up to that pledge.\nThe conventional wisdom is that he didn\u2019t think Senate and Assembly leaders could round up enough votes without him to pass such a flawed law. But it\u2019s more likely that he was looking for a bill that both tenant leaders and the industry would endorse, only to realize that was impossible.\n\u201cThe governor played chicken and lost,\u201d said Jay Martin of the New York Apartment Association, which represents rent-stabilized owners and was not part of Cuomo\u2019s recent meeting with REBNY.\nWhatever Cuomo\u2019s rationale, I have no doubt that he was looking for the best possible outcome for himself, not for rent-stabilized housing. All politicians put their careers first in such moments. That\u2019s why he pretended to embrace the outcome, rubbing salt in landlords\u2019 wounds by celebrating with a bill-signing ceremony.\nAnother reason it\u2019s hard for landlords to wrap their brains around Cuomo\u2019s public explanation is that changes to individual apartment improvements and major capital improvements were hardly the only problem with the law.\nIt also made deregulation virtually impossible for individual units. That matters a lot for buildings\u2019 financial and physical health because market-rate rents from units in otherwise rent-stabilized buildings provide an important cross-subsidy.\nLandlords use that revenue to maintain and improve their properties, to attract and retain free-market tenants \u2014 something they have little incentive to do for regulated tenants, but which clearly benefits those renters.\nCuomo also presided over the separation of rent stabilization and the 421a tax abatement for multifamily projects. The two laws had been paired legislatively for years so the industry and tenants each had something to gain from the passage of the other. It was an unusual but effective political arrangement.\nSevering them left the governor with less leverage when the time came to renew the rent law, and the newly left-leaning legislature closed the rent spigot until nothing but drops came out. Buildings began to shrivel, and violations have piled up.\nCuomo\u2019s rivals in the mayoral race are all talking about his subsequent scandals \u2014 the nursing home fiasco and sexual harassment allegations.\nBut those matter little to owners whose buildings are under water and who are still waiting for accountability on the 2019 rent law. They were not in the meeting with REBNY, which is clearly backing Cuomo for mayor.\n\u201cAll of a sudden, it\u2019s wrapped in a bow,\u201d Martin said of Cuomo\u2019s sitdown. \u201cIt\u2019s kumbaya.\u201d\n",

Last week, the commission reassigned the $640,000 loan commitment to phase two of the affordable housing development.\nThough Pinnacle did not obtain 9 percent low-income housing tax credits last year, the developer landed other types of financing for phase one of Pinnacle at Cypress, including a State Apartment Incentive Loan (SAIL). In addition, \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten a bond inducement from the Broward County Housing Finance Authority, and we\u2019re in the process of applying now for some additional Broward County gap financing,\u201d Timothy Wheat, a partner of\nPinnacle\n, told\nThe Real Deal.\nThe developer will break ground in the first quarter of 2026 for construction of 100 affordable apartments for seniors in phase one, Wheat said. Pinnacle will complete construction of the two-phased development in June 2028, according to a conceptual timeline the developer submitted to the city.\n\nThe total cost of the development is nearly $90 million, he said.\nEligibility to become a tenant of Pinnacle at Cypress is based on area median income. On average, tenants of the senior and workforce housing units will earn 60 percent of AMI. AMI is $81,900, according to the Broward Housing Council.\nPinnacle is led by partners Louis Wolfson III, David Deutch, Wheat and Coraly Rodriguez and Hugo Pacanins.\nThe 1.8-acre site of Pinnacle at Cypress at 6250 North Andrews Avenue is owned by Poliakoff Becker &amp; Strietfeld LLP, led by Fort Lauderdale attorney Keith M. Poliakoff. He said that he and other owners of the site entered a partnership with Pinnacle to develop the affordable housing complex.\nPoliakoff also said the development at\nCypress Creek\nwill qualify for streamlined city approval by city staff under the state\u2019s\nLive Local Act,\nwhich encourages commercial-industrial multifamily developments with an affordable housing component in areas not zoned for residential property.\n\u201cThis development will move much quicker than other affordable deals, because it generally does not require board approvals,\u201d Poliakoff said.\nThe MS Foundation, which occupies an office building on the phase-two portion of the development site, will relocate to ground-floor office space in the 100-unit apartment building for seniors.",

        "content": "A federal office building\u2019s listing in downtown San Antonio created an opening for city officials to advance their vision for a major new sports and entertainment district.\nThe plans offer a hopeful glimpse of what could become of dozens of federal properties recently marked for disposition nationwide.\nThe 163,060-square-foot building at 727 East C\u00e9sar E. Ch\u00e1vez Boulevard is one of eight properties nationwide the U.S. General Services Administration has listed for \u201caccelerated disposition,\u201d the San Antonio Express-News\nreported\n.\nThe 1974 building has housed agencies like the Social Security Administration, Federal Bureau of Prisons and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and sits within Hemisfair, a former World\u2019s Fair site that\u2019s become central to the city\u2019s long-term development plans.\nSan Antonio officials have long expressed interest in acquiring the building and nearby federally owned parking lots, which would give it greater control over land tied to Project Marvel, its\nredevelopment plan\nfeaturing a new San Antonio Spurs arena that could run the city as much as $4 billion. Officials did not disclose the status of negotiations for the building, or whether any are occurring.\nProject Marvel also calls for an expanded convention center, renovated Alamodome, second convention hotel and surrounding retail, residential and park space. Officials plan to create a land bridge over Interstate 37 to better connect the campus to the rest of the city.\n\nAgencies currently housed in the building may not need to move, the GSA said. A sale-leaseback is possible, depending on a new owner\u2019s plans.\nGSA has been refining a broader list of over 400 federal properties initially marked for sale, narrowing it based on maintenance costs, vacancy and availability of replacement space. No details have been released on the San Antonio building\u2019s condition or current occupancy rate.\nIn 2022, the city acquired two other federal properties nearby \u2014 the John H. Wood Jr. Federal Courthouse and the Adrian A. Spears Judicial Training Center \u2014 through a long-planned land swap.\nThe city also still holds an exclusive option to lease or buy the Institute of Texan Cultures site at 801 East C\u00e9sar E Ch\u00e1vez Boulevard, where the new arena would be located.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

Paxton said his office would pursue any violations of state law uncovered in the course of the investigation.\n\nThe probe follows online backlash that began after videos promoting the neighborhood went viral, drawing millions of views and criticism from right-wing figures and elected officials. State Rep. Jeff Leach, a Republican from Allen, previously called on Paxton to investigate whether the development would incorporate Sharia law, a charge that EPIC City\u2019s supporters have rejected.\nCommunity Capital Partners will work with Paxton\u2019s office to cooperate with the investigation to correct what president Imran Chaudhary characterized as misinformation and \u201crumor-milling.\u201d\nThe investigation comes as the East Plano Islamic Center has moved forward with two additional developments, EPIC Ranches One and Two, which would span 200 acres near the main site.\nOther state leaders also weighed in, including Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who suggested in a\npost on X\nthat the legislature may introduce new restrictions, along with a pending\nbill meant to ban foreign buyers\n, in response to projects like EPIC City.

        "content": "A New York City new development heavyweight is jumping from Douglas Elliman to Compass.\nDennis Mangone is joining the city\u2019s largest brokerage by headcount after more than a decade with his previous firm, where he developed a reputation for working with developers such as the Witkoff Group\u2019s Steve Witkoff, hotelier Ian Schrager and Alan Faena.\nIn his new role, Mangone is tasked with growing Compass\u2019 new development marketing business in New York and South Florida. Mangone previously worked on projects such as Schrager\u2019s 160 Leroy and Schrager and Witkoff\u2019s 215 Chrystie Street.\nA spokesperson for Compass said Mangone is the \u201cperfect person\u201d to bring the firm\u2019s new development business to the next level, given his longstanding relationships with developers and experience on the pre-development and design side of projects.\n\u201cWe see a real opportunity with new development right now,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe really want to lean into it.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Elliman said the firm \u201c[wishes] Dennis the best of luck.\u201d\nMangone\njoined Elliman\nfrom Brown Harris Stevens in 2011, bringing with him a roster of celebrity clients including Beyonce, Ricky Martin and Mario Testino. That year, Mangone sold Studio 54 co-founder Schrager\u2019s four-bedroom duplex at 285 Lafayette Street for\n$11 million\n.\n\nMangone has also worked with major fashion names such as Fabien Baron, French art director and magazine editor. Mangone sold his Soho condo for\n$7.5 million\nin 2012. Mangone also partnered with Elliman\u2019s Raphael De Niro to\nsell units at the Puck Building\n, which included deals north of $20 million.\nOutside of New York, Mangone worked on the pre-development of Schrager\u2019s The Residences at The Miami Beach Edition and Terra and Related Groups\u2019 Park Grove Miami.\nAt Compass, Mangone will focus particularly on branded residences. These developments have been gaining significant traction in New York. For example, Vlad Doronin\u2019s Aman New York quickly sold out and logged a number of banner deals. (Doronin himself paid $135 million for the penthouse at the Midtown development last year.)\nCompass\u2019 new development division in New York was built largely by\nacquiring the once-boutique\nManhattan firm, Stribling &amp; Associates, in 2019. Alexa Lambert, who spent 25 years with Stribling before joining Compass as part of the merger, was the top new development broker in the city in\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s\nlatest ranking\n, thanks in part to sales at some of Miki Naftali\u2019s Upper East Side projects.\n\u201cThis marks an exciting new chapter in my journey,\u201d Mangone wrote in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m eager to contribute to Compass\u2019s continued evolution.\u201d\nMangone\u2019s departure is the latest in a string of agent defections from Elliman to Compass. Just last month, top agent Holly Parker and her New York-based team\nmade the jump\nafter more than two decades with her former firm.\n",

        "content": "The 300 families who lost their homes in east Malibu to the Palisades firestorm have one more challenge to rebuild their houses: rising seas.\nHomeowners must not only gird their new homes with new fireproofing measures. They must also rebuild their homes to guard against rising seas and stronger storms from the south and west,\nthe Los Angeles Times reported.\nAnd that means raising the homes and constructing sturdier seawalls to protect properties and their septic systems from ocean encroachment brought about by climate change \u2014 with some projections putting sea level rise at up to 9 feet by the end of this century.\nThose that lost their homes simply want a chance to rebuild their houses and put their lives back together. Many families had inherited the aging properties built along the Pacific Coast Highway, with most of their wealth tied to the beach.\nOthers, including academics and climate policy analysts, suggest what local and state politicians will not: removing homes along the beach to accommodate the advancing ocean.\n\u201cRight now it would be political suicide for anyone in public office to talk about not rebuilding everything and anything, after the fires,\u201d one longtime observer of coastal development, who asked not to be named to avoid alienating Malibu homeowners, told the Times.\n\u201cThis is not a time that invites the most thoughtful policy discussion.\u201d\nFor the swath of homes along PCH from Topanga Canyon Boulevard to Carbon Canyon torched in the January firestorm, the damage appears to be getting worse. With little dry sand or protective shore, tides and waves continue to wash charred debris from burned homes into Santa Monica Bay, according to the Times.\nWith homes and their seawalls now heavily damaged, the already vulnerable Highway 1 could be more exposed to erosion. In addition, hundreds of septic systems for human waste at each of the houses remain buried under blackened debris.\n\nMany homeowners will be required to install bigger tanks and better protective devices, which could drive up costs $250,000 or more. For Malibu, incorporated 34 years ago to keep L.A. County from installing sewers and a flood of development, installing sewers is a nonstarter.\n\u201cWe want to get people back in their houses, and with the sewer system there are major hurdles,\u201d Malibu Mayor Doug Stewart told the Times. \u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves and think we can wait three or four or five years to get a sewer system and then start rebuilding homes.\u201d\nMost of the fire victims face insurance payouts not expected, in most cases, to cover all their costs, with an estimated price tag for reconstruction at $1,000 a square foot or more.\nWhile Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered a waiver of the California Environmental Quality Act and the state Coastal Act to speed rebuilding, scientists predict challenges along the coast will grow with time.\n\u201cI think we suffer from what I call a short disaster memory. We want to get in there and build and rebuild as fast as we can,\u201d Gary Griggs, a UC Santa Cruz oceanographer and coastal geologist, told the Times. But the impermanence of coastal construction \u201dis not something most people are interested in hearing about.\u201d\nThe author of \u201cCalifornia Catastrophes: The Natural Disaster History of the Golden State,\u201d said extreme extreme weather \u2014 with bigger and more energetic waves connected to the warming climate \u2014 could be the biggest threat to coastal homes.\nMany lots along the east Malibu shore reach over the mean tide line \u2014 the boundary between private property and land that belongs to the public, according to the newspaper. Environmental advocates have called for a \u201cmanaged retreat\u201d for especially vulnerable properties.\n\u201cThe public has a portfolio with the public land along this stretch,\u201c Wade Graham, a historian who taught urban and environmental policy at Pepperdine University in Malibu, told the Times. \u201cI think it\u2019s really problematic to allow those houses to be rebuilt on that stretch of highway, where they probably shouldn\u2019t be in the 21st century.\u201d\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

LaVine purchased the three-bedroom condo in September 2022 for the same price from former Chicago Bears linebacker Khalil Mack.\nJameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agent Nancy Tassone has the listing.\nUnit 2802 features a 750-square-foot wraparound terrace, complete with a hot tub and overhead heaters.\nIt has three and a half bathrooms, a 60-foot linear ventless fireplace and a living room outfitted with custom millwork. The kitchen is stocked with high-end appliances, including a steam oven and a 14-foot waterfall island.\n\nThe primary suite includes a sitting room and built-in bar, along with a bathroom featuring a TV-equipped dual shower and rain shower and a bathtub with a pop-up TV lift and champagne bucket. Heated floors and inlaid stone hallways fill out the package.\nLaVine\u2019s listing is the latest in a string of high-profile real estate activity at 9 West Walton. The tower has attracted a long list of athletes and business figures, including Ken Griffin, Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Jason Heyward, Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews.\nGriffin previously purchased the top four floors for nearly $59 million, and Pritzker acquired the top two from him\nlast year for $19 million\n.\nThe annual property taxes for Levine\u2019s unit were listed at $129,361, and monthly HOA dues total $4,937, or more than $59,000 annually.\nLuxury Chicago condos have been hot lately, particularly in the Gold Coast. Chicago Bulls forward Patrick Williams\ndropped $5.7 million\non a unit at 65 East Goethe Street last summer, and the most expensive deal so far this year went down for a\n$10 million penthouse\nin the Elm and State building.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "A massive park project is nearing construction in Dallas\u2019 urban core, with backers hoping it becomes the next centerpiece of civic life \u2014 and a catalyst for billions in real estate development.\nHarold Simmons Park, a long-planned $325 million green space along the Trinity River led by the Trinity Park Conservancy and the Trinity River Corridor Local Government Corp., is expected to begin construction April 8 after decades of planning, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n, citing a project presentation during a city meeting Tuesday.\nThe 250-acre site will stretch between the Margaret McDermott and Ronald Kirk bridges, with initial construction focused on the 22-acre West Overlook, which will include filter gardens, a water-play area and a skate and bike park.\nOnce completed, the park is projected to generate $2.7 billion in adjacent development over the next 30 years, according to a recent city presentation. Backers also anticipate 4 million annual visitors and an estimated $7 billion economic impact, while creating 600 construction jobs and more than 260 permanent positions.\nThe project\u2019s scale and ambition evoke Klyde Warren Park, the 5.4-acre deck park over Woodall Rodgers Freeway that has become one of Dallas\u2019 most transformative urban spaces.\n\nBut unlike Klyde Warren, which stitched together downtown and Uptown on a sliver of capped freeway, Harold Simmons Park occupies open riverfront land long seen as underutilized. Its size and programming could rival other metros\u2019 parks nationwide, with sport courts, a roller skate rink and new public buildings designed by Lake Flato and Wernerfield, and landscape architecture by New York-based Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates.\nKlyde Warren Park helped trigger over $1 billion in adjacent development and has become a case study in leveraging green space for real estate and community investment. Simmons Park aims to replicate that success at five times the size, and in a part of Dallas still awaiting reinvention.\nThe park is named after the late billionaire Harold Simmons, a Dallas businessman known for his leveraged buyouts. It\u2019s one of several major green space initiatives planned throughout the city, including Halperin Park, The Loop Dallas and the Five Mile Greenbelt.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Shed the sheds. Get sheds down.\nThe City Council on Wednesday voted to hopefully\nshed\nthe number of terrible shed-related calls to action.\nThe Sheddies\ncan stay, I guess.\nThe Council approved a package of bills that: ramp up penalties for owners who continuously renew permits for sidewalk sheds without progressing on fa\u00e7ade repairs, require the Department of Buildings to lengthen the period of time between mandatory fa\u00e7ade inspections and bumps the first required inspection from five years to eight years after a building is constructed.\nOne of the bills also requires the DOB to recommend less ugly sidewalk shed designs by Sept. 30. Sheds can also now be metallic gray, white or \u201ca color matching the fa\u00e7ade, trim, cornice, or roof of the building.\u201d Another bill requires more lighting under sidewalk sheds. I broke down the bills, sponsored by Council members Keith Powers and Erik Bottcher,\nhere\n.\nThe bottom line is that these bills are aimed at reducing the number of sheds that clog city sidewalks.\nAccording to the DOB\n, more than 8,500 sheds are up throughout the city, and have been for an average of 511 days.\nThe Real Estate Board of New York raised some issues with the original versions of some of the\nbills\n, including one that creates penalties for owners who fail to file permits for work within eight months of installing a shed and those that fail to complete that work within two years. The amended version of that bill seems to address REBNY\u2019s concern, allowing owners to file a request for an extension if they can explain why the work cannot be completed within the timeframe. Filing such an application temporarily stops the clock for calculating penalties.\n\u201cWe commend the bills\u2019 sponsors, City Council and Administration for considering the concerns from our industry on this topic and advancing legislation that will spur more user-friendly and creative sidewalk sheds,\u201d Daniel Avery, REBNY\u2019s director of policy, said in a statement. He noted that there are still issues that need to be worked out in the rulemaking process.\nA lot will be worked out in the rulemaking process. One of the measures calls on the DOB to adopt new rules to increase the time between fa\u00e7ade inspections from five years to sometime between six and 12 years. Powers noted on Wednesday that the agency will apply different timeframes based on a number of factors (fa\u00e7ade materials require different levels of maintenance).\nIf it feels like we\u2019ve been talking about the scourge of sidewalk sheds for a long time, that\u2019s because we have. This legislation has been a long time coming. In 2023, the mayor pitched his \u201cGet Sheds Down\u201d initiative and Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine released his \u201cShed the Shed\u201d report. And years before that, legislation to crackdown on these sheds was introduced in the Council.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nSpeaking of talking about things for a long time, it looks like we\u2019ll be talking about City of Yes for Housing Opportunity for the foreseeable future. What do you think about the\nlawsuit\nthat was just filed challenging the rezoning? Send a note to kathryn@therealdeal.com.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nPolitical consultant Jeffrey Leb, who has been behind a number of PACs that have taken contributions from the real estate industry, has a new PAC supporting Sen. Simcha Felder\u2019s run for City Council. The group hasn\u2019t yet posted information on contributions.\n\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 A state lawmaker proposed a bill on Wednesday that would rescind permits for Tesla\u2019s five sales locations in New York,\nPolitico New York reports\n. \u201cNo matter what we do, we\u2019ve got to take this from Elon Musk,\u201d Assembly member Pat Fahy, a lawmaker who championed legislation to fully lift restrictions on direct sales by EV makers, told Politico. \u201cHe\u2019s part of an effort to go backwards.\u201d\n\u2014\nICYMI: State Sen. Simcha Felder won the special election to fill Assembly member Kalman Yeger\u2019s vacant City Council seat in Brooklyn,\nCity &amp; State reports\n.\nFelder is finishing Kalman\u2019s two year term, which started in 2023, so he will run in the June primary and the general election in November.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Wednesday was\n$14.75 million\nfor a 5,000-square-foot duplex co-op unit at 834 Fifth Avenue in Lenox Hill. The Deborah Grubman Team of The Corcoran Group\nhad the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$2.6 million\nfor a 7,872-square-foot, 13-unit walkup apartment building at 25-32 Steinway Street in Astoria.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$16.9 million\nfor a 8,560-square-foot house at 42 West 71st Street on the Upper West Side. Jasmine Ji of Compass has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 99,031-square-foot, six-story community facility project at 269 Heyward Street in East Williamsburg. Amr Ouda of Jay Architect &amp; Engineering filed the permit on behalf of David Kohn.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "For South Side developer Jamie Nahon, a plan to capitalize on Bronzeville\u2019s real estate hype may have been easier said than done.\nIn 2021, Nahon set out to build over 20 townhomes scattered throughout Bronzeville and Woodlawn in hopes of cashing in on the area\u2019s growing cach\u00e9. A website promoted the project as a chance for investors to reap the benefits of the Opportunity Zone program, a federal policy that provides tax breaks to real estate investments in underserved areas.\nIt pointed to the groundbreaking of the multi-billion dollar megadevelopment known as Bronzeville Lakefront and the ongoing construction of the Obama Presidential Library in nearby Woodlawn as evidence that the time was right to get in on the early stages of the neighborhood\u2019s turnaround after decades of population loss.\nBut four years later, many of Nahon\u2019s townhomes sit vacant, while the developer navigates legal fights with Green Day Construction, the general contractor for the project.\nNahon and Green Day, which is run by Scott Allbright, agreed to a two-phase construction contract totaling about $15 million. Phase one involved the construction and rehab of 11 townhomes for $7.3 million or about $671,000 per building. Phase two involved the construction and rehab of 11 townhomes for $8.2 million or about $754,000 per building.\nAlthough most of the work was completed and paid for, Nahon, via an LP called Eagle OZB I, sued Green Day Construction accusing the company of low-balling its initial budget proposal, repeatedly requesting budget increases, diverting project funds for unrelated use, performing shoddy construction work and over-extending the completion timeline. The lawsuit also alleges that some buildings were left incomplete, including lacking appliances that were already paid for.\nNahon declined to comment. Allbright, his legal representatives and Nahon\u2019s attorneys did not respond to requests for comment.\nGreen Day Construction isn\u2019t willing to take all the blame, and is instead fighting back. It also filed mechanics liens against Eagle OZB\u2019s ownership of the properties, alleging the contractor is owed about $1.2 million for unpaid work outlined in the updated budget. Green Day requested a judge to approve a foreclosure of the properties that could transfer their ownership to the contractor, if advanced.\nHowever, Nahon also alleges Green Day Construction\u2019s poor craftsmanship led to significant maintenance issues within the buildings such as widespread plumbing leaks and access points for rodent infestations. It\u2019s unclear how many tenants moved into the properties but Nahon\u2019s lawsuit said some moved out due to maintenance concerns that Nahon alleges Green Day Construction refused to remedy.\n\nMany of the tri-flat buildings appear empty and are advertised for lease or for sale. Two sold for around $1 million and one sold for $875,000. Rents for individual units range from about $2,200 to $2,600.\nMeanwhile, a subcontractor sued Green Day Construction as well, alleging it\u2019s owed $235,000 for the entirety of a contract between the company and the general contractor for work on the townhomes.\nSeparately, Nahon is suing Green Day Construction for incomplete work on a $3.3 million renovation project for a 68-unit multifamily property at 7109 South Bennett Avenue in Bronzeville. The lawsuit alleges that Green Day Construction again low-balled its initial estimate and surpassed an agreed upon construction completion deadline.\nAs cost overruns added at least $2 million to the project, Nahon took out a separate loan from Renovo Financial backed by a personal guarantee to fund the additional costs.\nBut even with the additional funding, the projects continued to confront issues and stall. Nahon\u2019s lawsuit alleges that Allbright blamed overruns on inflation but also admitted to intentionally low-balling his initial construction estimates to land the job. Nahon also suspects Allbright of intentionally diverting funds for the project to non-related business and personal use, his lawsuit alleges.\nNahon would not have taken out the second loan had he known about Allbright\u2019s alleged fabrication of the initial estimate and misdealing of funds, his lawsuit alleges.\nConstruction came to a standstill in September and in December, Allbright filed mechanics liens against the property, alleging Green Day Construction is owed $236,000 for unpaid work on the project. The lawsuits remain pending in Cook County court.\nNahon in January listed for sale a\nformer Catholic school building at 545 East Oakwood\nin Bronzeville, previously slated for demolition and redevelopment, for $1.1 million, after he bought it from the Archdiocese of Chicago for $725,000 in September.\nIn 2023,\nNahon\u2019s firm Eagle Infinite\npurchased a $29 million portfolio of multifamily buildings across the Bronzeville, Kenwood and Hyde Park neighborhoods.\n",

        "content": "A long-neglected home designed by Frank Lloyd Wright on Chicago\u2019s West Side is finally set to receive urgent repairs, marking the first meaningful step toward its preservation after decades of decay.\nThe Walser House, a 122-year-old residence at 42 North Central Avenue in the Austin neighborhood, will be repaired by the bank that holds the mortgage, previously reported as PHH Mortgage, which informed a Cook County judge earlier this month that it would begin addressing a host of prevailing building code violations, the Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\n.\nPreservationists view the repairs as crucial to saving the home, one of Wright\u2019s early works and a rare architectural landmark in a part of the city that has seen far less preservation investment than areas like Oak Park. Restoration costs are estimated at about $500,000, said Barbara Gordon, the conservancy\u2019s executive director.\nBuilt in 1903, the stucco residence was designed for printing executive Joseph Jacob Walser Jr. and is noted for its horizontal lines, overhanging eaves and bands of windows \u2014 features that would later define Wright\u2019s signature Prairie School style.\nThe home has fallen into serious disrepair. A court filing detailed damage that includes rotting wood, cracked stucco, exposed structural elements and a deteriorating roof and chimney.\n\nIt has stood vacant since its last owner died in 2019, and it is also entangled in foreclosure proceedings, with\na reverse mortgage that exceeds the home\u2019s value\n.\nA coalition of preservation advocates \u2014 including Austin Coming Together, the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy, Landmarks Illinois and Preservation Chicago \u2014 has pushed for years to save the house. Local leaders hope the home can ultimately be donated to a nonprofit that would raise funds to restore the property and repurpose it as a community space or tourism site.\nA status hearing on the repairs is scheduled for April 1, and while the future of the Walser House is still far from certain, preservationists say the bank\u2019s commitment signals the first real progress in years.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Berkeley\u2019s largest hotel and biggest waterfront tenant is headed toward default, according to Morningstar. The $48.3 million loan on the 378-room DoubleTree Berkeley Marina was transferred to special servicing this month for \u201cimminent monetary\u201d default.\nThe ratings company gave low revenue as one reason for the default, with a debt service coverage ratio of just .34x last year. It has been below issuance since the pandemic, according to Morningstar.\nHong Kong-based\nJunson Capital\n, the family office for Chinese billionaire Cai Kui, has owned the waterfront hotel since 2014 through 200 Marina LLC. The loans in question were originated by Wells Fargo and UBS in 2017 and packaged into a commercial mortgage-backed securities offering that year.\nBingdong Zhao, the New York-based head of Junson\u2019s Real Estate Investment Division, is listed as the manager of 200 Marina LLC in city documents. He did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\nIn April 2020, Junson representatives worked out a new 22-year extension to the land lease with the city, which owns the 14 acres the hotel and its 425 parking spaces have sat on since 1972, according to city records.\nThe lease now runs until 2080 and negotiations included a $3 million capital contribution for sidewalk improvements as well as an increase in rent minimums from $306,000 a year to $841,591 a year, with annual adjustments for inflation, according to a city report on the lease.\n\nThe hotel also pays the city a percentage rent on a quarterly basis, with a credit given for minimum rent, and that remains at 5 percent of room revenue and 2.5 percent of food and beverage revenue. Starting in 2040, and every 10 years after that, the city can reset those percentages \u201cif they are no longer reflective of market trends,\u201d the report says.\nThe new lease also requires the owner and any successor to operate it as a full-service hotel with at least an \u201cUpscale\u201d rating as defined by the STR Chain Scale. Other Upscale brands include Four Points by Sheraton, Hyatt House, Crowne Plaza and Wyndham. The 2020 lease report also noted that the owners had just completed an $8 million renovation to their back patio and waterfront restaurant, The Berkeley Boathouse.\nEven prior to the rent increase, the Doubletree Hotel\u2019s $1.4 million in annual rent payments made up more than 20 percent of all Marina Fund revenue and its transit occupancy tax generated close to $3 million for the city\u2019s general fund, according to the report. City Manager Paul Buddenhagen and Parks Recreation and Waterfront Director Scott Ferris did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the possible impacts of the default on the city and its marina, which is also home to two other full-service restaurants, Cesar Chavez Park and the Berkeley Yacht Club.\nThis is the second time the same hotel has been in default, albeit under different ownership. In 2010 it was owned by a partnership of Houston-based Westmont Hospitality Group and Montreal-based Cadim when they went into default on a $160 million loan with Citigroup, according to reporting from the time. That loan covered seven hotels in total: the Doubletree Berkeley, plus two hotels in Florida, two in North Carolina, one in Michigan and one in Ohio.\nDoubleTree Berkeley Marina is also one of many hotels under financial strain in the Bay Area since the pandemic, including two owned by Park Hotels in San Francisco, which recently found a buyer on its\n$725 million debt\n.\n",

        "content": "A mystery buyer has bought a 10,200-square-foot mansion on San Francisco\u2019s Billionaires\u2019 Row in a first-time sale for $26.5 million \u2014 $11.5 million less than the initial ask.\nThe family of the late philanthropists Fritz and Lucy Jewett sold the landmark home at the top of the famed Lyon Street Steps at 2990 Broadway in Pacific Heights, next to the Presidio, the\nSan Francisco Business Times\nreported.\nThe sale of the home, known as the Jewett House, was the first since the property was built in 1987.\nGeorge Jewett had initially listed his parents\u2019 home in June for\n$38 million\n, making it the priciest home listing in San Francisco, then cut the price in response to recent sales along the luxury Row. Lucy Jewett died in 2023 at age 94. Her husband Fritz died in 2008.\nThe Jewitts, heirs to the Weyerhaeuser lumber fortune, built the four-bedroom, 10-bathroom estate in 1987, where they hosted such guests as Nancy Pelosi, former President George H.W. Bush and Britain\u2019s Prince Philip.\nThe last house on Outer Broadway, designed by Sandy Walker, has sweeping views of the Golden Gate Bridge, Marin Headlands and Alcatraz.\nThe white mansion with curved bay windows has a grand entryway with a dramatic winding staircase, solarium, and hardwood and marble floors across numerous living rooms with 13-foot ceilings.\n\nThere\u2019s a full-service bar, library, butler\u2019s pantry and a seven-car garage. An outdoor balcony runs the width of the house, which has a gym and a spa and overlooks a garden.\nBrokers Joe Lucier and Stacey Caen of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty held the listing.\nIts sale doesn\u2019t come close to the home price record for San Francisco, set in July when Laurene Powell Jobs closed on a 17,300-square-foot mansion at 2840 Broadway for\n$71 million\n. In 2021, a home down the street from the Jewetts\u2019 sold for $43.5 million.\nThis year\u2019s official home price record belongs to a mystery buyer, who used an LLC for the off-market purchase on Jan. 31 of an 8,300-square-foot home at 260 Sea Cliff Avenue for\n$30 million\n,\nThe Real Deal\nreported. The seller was Douglas Shorenstein, former chairman and CEO of Shorenstein Properties.\nThe unofficial home price record in San Francisco belongs to\nSam Altman, who bought the Russian Hill home next door to his own\nfor what was reported to the multiple listing service to be\n$38.5 million\n\u2014 but listed in city records at $14 million.\nThis year ushered in a booming start for luxury properties in San Francisco, with a\n40 percent jump\nin luxury home, condo and co-op sales from a year earlier, according to the Business Times.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "A convoluted legal fight is brewing over a portion of the land underneath the Kimpton Surfcomber Hotel in Miami Beach.\nSean and Nicole Mirmelli, as trustees for the Deirdre Mirmelli Irrevocable Trust, sued Chisholm Properties South Beach last week in Miami-Dade Circuit Court over alleged violations of a 99-year-ground lease for one of two parcels beneath the three-story, 186-key\nArt Deco\nbuilding. The Mirmellis, who are siblings, want a court-appointed receiver to take over operation and management of the portion of the hotel site for which they have a joint 50 percent stake.\nThe sister and brother are seeking more than $20.5 million in damages, as well as a court order affirming cancellation of the ground lease and forcing Chisholm, led by Miami Beach hotelier\nRobert Balzebre\n, to cease operating the hotel, the lawsuit states. The complaint alleges Chisholm took out an unauthorized loan more than a decade ago without the Mirmellis\u2019 consent.\n\u201cMy clients grew up at the Surfcomber hotel,\u201d Joseph Pardo, Mirmellis\u2019 attorney, told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cImagine you woke up one morning and learned that your neighbor put a mortgage on a property that\u2019s been in your family for generations.\u201d\nIn a joint statement, Chisholm\u2019s attorneys Philippe Lieberman and Abbey Kaplan said the lawsuit has no merit.\n\u201cThe Surfcomber hotel is a great property that fell into disrepair when operated by the Mirmelli family,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAnd has since been brought back to iconic status because of Chisholm\u2019s great effort, hard work, and significant multimillion-dollar renovation that has enhanced the property.\u201d\n\nSince the mid-1990s, the Mirmellis have owned their 50 percent stake of a parcel at 1731 Collins Avenue that makes up half of the Surfcomber assemblage. Chisholm has owned the other 50 percent since 2004, records show.\nBalzebre\u2019s firm also owns the entire parcel at 1717 Collins Avenue that makes up the other half of the hotel site, as well as the building itself. Chisholm acquired both for $1.4 million, records show.\nThe Mirmellis, whose cousin\nAndrew Mirmelli\nis a prolific Miami Beach real estate investor, control the ground lease for the 1731 Collins Avenue lot that they co-own with Chisholm, records show. The lease was executed in 1948 by the original owners of the property when the hotel was built.\nIn 2011, Chisholm renovated the\nSurfcomber hotel\nand Kimpton took over management of the building. Three years later, Chisholm took out a $20.5 million loan with Bank of America secured by the hotel and both parcels.\nIn the lawsuit, the Mirmellis allege the mortgage was secured without their knowledge or consent, and that an estoppel letter attached to the loan with Nicole Mirmelli\u2019s purported signature is a forgery. In an affidavit attached to the complaint, she denies signing the document and said that she had never seen it until recently. An estoppel letter is a document that verifies the current status of a lease agreement.\n\u201cCounsel for Chisholm provided the [estoppel] certificate that is referenced in the complaint,\u201d Pardo said. \u201cWe did our homework and very quickly determined the certificate is not authentic.\u201d\nThe Mirmellis learned about the loan while conducting their due diligence for a pending deal to sell their stake in 1731 Collins Avenue, the lawsuit states. The mortgage, which holds first position, has placed a cloud over the title to the parcel, the Mirmellis allege.",

        "content": "Rialto Capital has found a new target in its aggressive pursuit to foreclose on borrowers of Signature Bank loans.\nRialto launched a foreclosure against Daryl Hagler\u2019s Cigar Factory creative office building in Astoria. Rialto alleges Hagler defaulted on a\n$20 million loan\nin October 2024. According to the lawsuit, Hagler, a health care entrepreneur, guaranteed the loan.\nPincusCo first\nreported\nthe news.\nIn 2023, Rialto, along with Blackstone and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, secured a\n20 percent\nstake in a venture holding Signature\u2019s $17 billion commercial real estate loan book. Rialto is tasked with servicing the debt.\nSince then, Rialto has embarked on a relentless pursuit of initiating defaults on property owners who had secured loans from the customer-friendly Signature Bank. At least one borrower, Joseph Cayre of Midtown Equities, filed suit against Rialto alleging the firm is illegally manufacturing defaults. (That suit was quickly settled).\nIn one case, Rialto initiated a foreclosure on Watermark Capital\u2019s 28-story, 497-unit residential project in Sunset Park last year. It was Hagler who stepped in as a lender and saved the project from foreclosure. Hagler provided a\n$42.5 million loan\nto Watermark, which replaced Rialto\u2019s loan.\nHagler was proud enough of the deal to put out a press release about it.\n\n\u201cMr. Daryl Hagler\u2019s swift action in replacing the debt allowed the project to proceed without further disruption,\u201d said the release.\nNow, Hagler \u2014 a co-owner of Centers Health Care and a vice chairman of El Al Airlines \u2014 is a target of\nRialto\n.\n\u201cWe are committed to engaging with borrowers to find the best resolutions possible. At the same time, we expect these sophisticated, commercial borrowers to honor the commitments they made,\u201d said a spokesperson from Rialto.\nHagler purchased the former DeNobili cigar factory at 35-11 9th Street for $26.4 million in 2022, marking a $5 million discount from what Bruce Brickman bought the 100,000-square-foot property in 2015.\nHagler is playing an increasingly active role in New York City real estate. He has backed Isaac Hager of Cornell Realty. The two partnered on a deal to acquire 960 Franklin Avenue in Crown Heights in Brooklyn for $42.8 million, which was sold in early 2024 for\n$64 million\n.\nHagler and his business partner, Kenneth Rozenberg, faced scrutiny from the New York Attorney General Letitia James for their oversight of nursing homes. The Attorney General\nsued\nthe partners in 2023, alleging they used more than $83 million in Medicaid and Medicare funds to enrich themselves. Hagler and Rozenberg settled for\n$45 million\n, with money going to improve resident care at the nursing homes.\nHagler did not return a request to comment.\n",

Dremonas\nfirst put the home on the market back in 2018\n, asking a whopping $21.9 million.\nThe home was later removed from the market and at least some of its space \u2014 perhaps its carriage house \u2014 listed for rent at a rate of $2,000 per month and, later, $4,000 per month, according to public listing information. It was last listed for sale publicly in July of 2019 at $19.5 million, but the listing was removed the following spring.\nNow, Dremonas is seeking $18.5 million for the home, or about $1,380 per square foot. The private listing\u2019s price tag makes it the second-priciest of any Chicago home listed publicly.\n\nThe mansion was built in 1888 by the architects behind the Chicago Opera House, according to a website used to market the property. It was an office for the Scottish Rite Cathedral from 1938 to 2006, receiving an historic landmark designation in 2003.\nThe home was last sold in 2009 to Dremonas for a little more than $3 million, records show. In 2009, \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d were invested into the mansion, renovating it to \u201cpreserve the original features while breathing new life into the home,\u201d the home\u2019s listing agent, Millie Rosenbloom of Baird &amp; Warner, said in a recent social media post. The total renovation cost was about $7 million, according to a 2018 Chicago Tribune\nreport\n.\nRosenbloom declined to comment on the listing Thursday. During Dremonas\u2019 previous attempt to sell, Coldwell Banker was the original listing brokerage.\nIts latest listing includes the mansion, attached three-car garage and a one-bedroom carriage house next door.\nCook County tax officials have pegged the property\u2019s value as high as $6.5 million in 2019, but have since lowered it to $4.8 million in its most recent assessments, public records show. Last year\u2019s tax bill at the property was a little more than $100,300, records show.\n",

        "content": "A push for density is reshaping the edges of Dallas.\nThe Dallas City Council approved development firm Henry S. Miller\u2019s plans to replace much of the aging Pepper Square shopping center in Far North Dallas with up to 868 apartments and several thousands of square feet of retail, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nThe measure passed 10-4 after clearing the City Planning Commission\nlast month\n, despite vocal opposition from dozens of nearby residents.\nThe 15.5-acre site at Preston and Belt Line roads will be redeveloped in phases, beginning with a four- or five-story residential building with parking, followed by a second building that could rise to 12 stories. A third phase would include two more mid-rise buildings.\nAltogether, the project could bring up to 67,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space, while preserving the southern portion of the site, where a Hobby Lobby and Trader Joe\u2019s will remain.\nThe rezoning marks a major milestone for the developer after more than two years of public meetings and scaled-down plans.\n\nMiller proposed more than 2,300 units in 2022 before cutting that number by more than half. The latest iteration also removes a previously proposed 116-unit mixed-income bonus but keeps 116 units designated for retirement housing.\nThe vote also adds to a growing list of approvals for large-scale multifamily developments in neighborhoods long dominated by single-family homes. The city is increasingly under pressure to add housing, and\nprojects like this one\nare being billed by proponents as essential to accommodating population growth and revitalizing aging commercial corridors.\nStill, the plan divided the community. More than 50 people signed up to speak at Wednesday\u2019s meeting, with nearly three-quarters opposing the project.\nCritics have cited traffic concerns, pressure on city services and changing neighborhood character. A traffic analysis by Kimley-Horn, commissioned by the developer, claims the new development would generate 50 percent fewer trips than the fully leased shopping center would.\nCouncil member Jaynie Schultz, who represents the district and supported the rezoning, called it one of the most difficult cases of her tenure, citing the political polarization and media attention surrounding the issue. She is not seeking reelection.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

The price was almost $1.6 million per acre.\nThe site previously housed several industrial and flex buildings. Riverbend Industries, a Chicago firm affiliated with one of Stack\u2019s development partners, was the seller.\nThe development will include a closed-loop water cooling system and be optimized for AI, machine learning and cloud workloads, Stack said.\nDemand for data storage fueled by artificial intelligence and cloud computing has been unrelenting. Industry professionals anticipate data center availability in top U.S. markets could all but disappear this year, and developers are racing to keep pace.\n\nThe O\u2019Hare-area market is one of the most competitive and supply-limited in the country, according to Stack.\nThe trend is reflected in other recent moves in Elk Grove Village, including Austin-based Digital Realty Trust\u2019s $900 million recapitalization of\ntwo data centers\nand a $185 million loan on a third. More recently, Virginia-based data center operator EdgeConneX\npaid $36.6 million\nfor two buildings at 821-891 Busse Road and the adjacent 901-985 Busse Road.\nLocal officials are embracing the shift. Elk Grove Village Mayor Craig Johnson said the project will bring jobs and \u201cresourceful development\u201d to one of the city\u2019s \u201cmost vital business corridors.\u201d\nChicago\u2019s suburbs have become a national hotspot for data center investment, particularly in repurposed industrial zones like the O\u2019Hare corridor.

The best way to reintroduce the district is through quality food and drink, Stream\u2019s Paul Bodenman said.\nStream is in talks with potential tenants, aiming to introduce businesses that can help transform the corridor into an 18-hour destination, starting with restaurants, and eventually adding other retail.\nThe firm, which began heavily acquiring properties on East Sixth in 2020, said leasing would open in\nJanuary last year\n. A year later, its tenant selection process is ongoing.\nThe company wants \u201chigh-quality operators,\u201d but not necessarily upscale dining, Bodenman said. A mix of local and national brands is expected, leveraging Austin\u2019s growing national profile.\n\nThis effort is a deliberate play for revitalization. The area was hurt by pandemic-era downturns and a mass shooting in 2021.\nRecent operational shifts show some early progress. The city reopened East Sixth to vehicle traffic from Thursday to Sunday evenings for the first time in decades. Preliminary police data shows a 21 percent drop in crimes against persons and an 11 percent decrease in arrests on weekend nights since the change.\nStill, trade-offs exist: the Pecan Street Festival, typically held on East Sixth, will move to Bee Cave this year due to the traffic change.\nStream has floated rebranding the area as \u201cOld Sixth,\u201d suggesting a desire to lean into the district\u2019s historic architecture and past status as a more rounded neighborhood destination.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Rent guidelines board season kicked off Thursday with the first of many temperature checks on the state of rent-stabilized housing, an asset class\ndrowning in distress.\nFor landlords praying for a lifeline in the form of a rent hike, the data isn\u2019t looking good.\nThis year\u2019s Income and Expense\nStudy\nfound buildings\u2019 net operating income \u2014\u00a0a measure of profitability \u2014\u00a0surged 8 percent between 2022 and 2023 when adjusted for inflation. (RGB data has a two-year lag time, a perpetual complaint of city landlords and their advocates.)\nDial in on the outer boroughs and Upper Manhattan, where distress has concentrated, and NOI grew 4.4 percent, according to the report \u2014\u00a0the first inflation-adjusted increase in four years.\nProperty owners, as in past years, called B.S. on the findings.\nFor starters, the New York Apartment Association, which represents rent-regulated owners, claimed the topline number includes over 120,000 free-market units. Many rent-regulated buildings were at least partially deregulated and contain a mix of market-rate and stabilized apartments.\n\u201cThe inclusion of these buildings distorts and confuses the data,\u201d NYAA CEO Kenny Burgos said. \u201cIt creates a warped perception that rent-stabilized buildings are doing okay, when the reality is that most are in severe financial distress.\u201d\nNYAA also said the analysis fails to break out inflation-adjusted data for properties outside of Core Manhattan and built before 1974. The RGB defines Core Manhattan as south of West 110th and East 96th Streets.\nThat older, outerborough product is more likely to be majority rent-regulated and therefore pulls lower rents, demands more repairs and is more likely to be distressed,\nrecent trades\nand\nforeclosures show.\nBy NYAA\u2019s math, NOI for that subset, which comprises 65 percent of the surveyed stock, slipped 2 percent between 2022 and 2023.\n\nBy borough, Bronx profits fell nearly 8 percent in the period, profits in Brooklyn by 0.2 percent, in Queens by 1 percent in Queens and in Northern Manhattan a little over 2 percent.\nThe Bronx is overwhelmingly rent-stabilized and its landlords are being\nthrottled\nby surging insurance costs.\nMeanwhile, RGB data showed inflation-adjusted NOI growth in Core Manhattan, where buildings popped 18.6 percent between 2022 and 2023. Those buildings are often newer, more recently stabilized at market rate and benefitting from a tax break, or if they\u2019re older, heavily deregulated.\nBefore the rent law banned the practice, owners deregulated units to reap the surging rents in the city. NYAA found pre-1974 buildings in the area, which are more likely to be deregulated, saw NOI jump 16.3 percent during the period.\n\u201cThis report shows a tale of two cities when it comes to regulated housing,\u201d Burgos concluded. \u201cThe data clearly shows disinvestment in these buildings from 2022 to 2023, which should alarm everyone.\u201d\nOne group seemingly unconcerned: tenant advocates.\nOn the heels of the report\u2019s release, Cea Weaver-led New York State Tenant Block claimed the RGB data supports a rent freeze, a demand\nechoed\nby rent-stabilized tenants every year since the pandemic.\nThe group argued the board has okayed three rent hikes in as many years and it\u2019s time for the members to throw tenants a bone.\nLandlords have repeatedly claimed that the hikes \u2014 7.75 percent in the last two and a half years \u2014 fail to cover inflation and the related surge in expenses, let alone needed renovations or mortgage payments, which are not calculated as part of NOI.\nBut the I&amp;E findings are only the beginning. There are still seven more reports, a slew of meetings and a preliminary hearing ahead of the board\u2019s final vote in June on adjustments for about half of the city\u2019s rental stock.\n",

        "content": "Pinnacle Housing Group\u2019s two-year-old apartment project near Fort Lauderdale\u2019s waterfront is hitting the market, and the listing brokers are expecting offers in the $50 million-plus range.\nMiami-based\nPinnacle\ncompleted Elyps, an eight-story building with 140 units at 2500 Southwest 22nd Terrace, in 2023, records show. The development firm is led by partners Louis Wolfson III, David Deutch, Timothy Wheat and Coraly Rodriguez.\n\u201cWe expect [Elyps] to trade in the low $50 million range,\u201d said Troy Ballard, a broker on the CBRE team marketing Elyps. \u201cThat makes it very attractive considering the [project] size with the waterfront nature. When someone buys [a waterfront multifamily project], they tend to hold on to them longer.\u201d\nPinnacle\u2019s business plan is to develop projects, stabilize them and move on to the next one, Ballard said.\n\nElyps, which overlooks Marina Bay Marina, is 94 percent leased with the average rent hitting $2,819 a month, according to CBRE The project offers a mix of one-, two- and three-bedroom units. Elyps is also designated as a\nLive Local Act\nproject, making it eligible for property tax credits on 100 units valued at $2,700 per apartment.\nElyps is the type of a mid-size multifamily project that expands the buyer pool beyond national institutional firms to include small family offices and high net worth real estate investors seeking a 1030 exchange deal, said Callum Weaver, another CBRE broker marketing the property.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very limited number of deals that trade with this number of units for new construction anywhere in South Florida,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cIt will check all of the boxes for a lot of different buyers.\u201d\nOverall, South Florida has experienced a handful of big-ticket multifamily trades through the first three months of the year. This month, Coral Gables-based Shoma Group sold Shoma Village, a mixed-use complex with 304 apartments, for\n$81 million\nto North Miami-based IMC Equity Group. In another March sale, insurance mogul Ivan Herrera\u2019s Unicapital Asset Management Group paid\n$71.5 million\nfor 850 Living, an eight-story, 230-unit multifamily project in Miami built in 2022 by the late developer Sergio Pino.\nLast month, Aventura-based BH Group dropped\n$83 million\nfor a waterfront complex of three 10-story buildings with 338 apartments in North Bay Village. And in January, Related Group and 13th Floor Investments, both based in Coconut Grove, acquired Arium Lincoln Pointe, a 285-unit property in Aventura, for\n$96.5 million\n.",

        "content": "A Presidio Heights home that hasn\u2019t changed hands in over 40 years went for more than $1 million over its $6.5-million asking, a sign that inventory-starved high-end buyers may finally be looking beyond turnkey properties \u2014 if the location is right.\nListing agent Ted Bartlett of Compass said that he and his co-listing agents Tina Bartlett Hinckley and Elizabeth Roeder \u201ccarefully priced\u201d 3333 Jackson, which had been in the same family for more than four decades.\nThe property was only on the market for eight days and received all non-contingent offers over asking from highly qualified buyers, he said. Bartlett said each prospective buyer was well represented by agents familiar with Presidio Heights and its local dynamics.\nBartlett did not name the sellers of the six-bedroom, four-bath 1913 Beaux Arts home, but property records show that it was owned by the Olness Family Trust and sold by the two sons of Richard and Susan Olness. The elder Olnesses both died in 2023 and Richard Olness ran his own eponymous real estate firm, according to their obituaries.\nCompass agent John Townsend repped the buyers and said that for years having a house in the city that needed \u201csome TLC\u201d was a \u201ctough sell.\u201d But buyer mindsets seem to be changing this year, he added. Townsend declined to name his clients but property records show it was Luke Ogelsby, a vice chairman at CBRE, and his wife Britt.\n\n3333 Jackson is \u201cquasi-livable\u201d as is, he said, which allowed potential buyers to \u201cchoose your own adventure as far as move in with minimal work and plan something later or do the big project.\u201d At nearly 5,000 square feet, any work could likely be done without a major expansion of the building envelope, making it a \u201cfar more manageable process.\u201d It has a prime location on a \u201ctop-ten block,\u201d with a relatively low price tag for the neighborhood, even with the overbidding.\n\u201cTo get a house of this scale on this block for under $8 million is difficult to say the least,\u201d he said, adding that it also has a walk-out south-facing yard, usable space in the basement and views from the top floor.\nTownsend said lack of inventory is pushing his buyers in Marin and San Francisco to offer\nhundreds of thousands of dollars\nover the asking price more and more often, even for fixers. Most are move-up buyers looking for their \u201cforever home.\u201d When you\u2019re looking at a long-term buy, he said, \u201cthe calculus changes as far as what you\u2019re willing to go after.\u201d\nTyler Stewart of Heath Real Estate, who recently represented the buyers on a\n$12.6-million deal around the corner\nfrom 3333 Jackson and also leads major renovation projects, agreed that the continued lack of inventory has made frustrated buyers feel like \u201cthey have no option but to build.\u201d\nConstruction prices are still high, averaging around $1,000 per square foot and upwards of double that for the kinds of high-end redesigns owners want in Presidio and Pacific Heights, she said. She anticipates that will only go up if the Trump tariffs on materials stay in place, and the high prices have put all her build out projects on hold.\nBut she said construction costs may be getting less important to long-term-minded luxury buyers who seem to be increasingly comfortable being \u201ca little in the red\u201d after their renovations, if they get the home they want, where they want it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re less worried about their return on investment, but they\u2019re realizing there is such a value to the quality of time that they get to spend at home, so if they end up overspending above what someone else would value their real estate at, they\u2019re okay with that,\u201d she said.\n",

He is incorrect on the law,\u201d Leitman Bailey said. \u201cWe will be expeditiously pursuing all remedies for our clients to regain the apartment as rent has not been paid and the lease has expired.\u201d\nAdam Turbowitz, an attorney for Arielle, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe two-bedroom, three-and-a-half bathroom apartment, spanning 3,700 square feet on the 59th floor, hit the market for rent about a month ago. The furnished unit is asking $55,000 a month with Serhant agents Marc Riedel and Jordyn Nusynowitz, according to\nStreetEasy\n. An availability date of April 1 is listed.\n\nRiedel as of November hung his license with Official Partners, the brokerage Tal and Oren founded with backing from white-label firm Side. (\nSide is also suing\nOren and Tal.)\nTal and his younger brothers, twins Oren and Alon, were all charged by the Southern District of New York with sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking.\nThe FBI raided Tal\u2019s apartment at 432 Park in December, the same day he was arrested at his parents\u2019 waterfront home in South Florida. Prosecutors said the raid\nturned up a hard drive\nwith videos and photos that showed Oren and Alon, along with unidentified third parties, \u201cengaged in sexual contact\u201d with women who appear to be intoxicated.\nProsecutors are expected to file a superseding indictment in the coming months that would likely include additional charges. FBI agents have spoken with about 60 women who say they were drugged and assaulted by one or more of the brothers over a period of time that spans over a decade.\nOren and Alon were also indicted in December by Miami-Dade prosecutors on charges of sexual battery, alongside their friend and former Official broker, Ohad Fisherman. Their trial is expected to occur later this year, as early as May. Fisherman\u2019s ankle monitor was recently removed,\nNBC Miami\nreported. Fisherman\u2019s attorneys argued his house arrest caused \u201csignificant harm\u201d to his \u201cdeeply held religious beliefs.\u201d\nThe Alexander brothers are also facing a number of civil lawsuits from women alleging they were drugged and assaulted.\nOn the business front, Tal and Official\nwere sued this week\nby the owners of a Soho penthouse. The plaintiff alleges it was defrauded of roughly $400,000 tied to the rental of an apartment at 54 Thompson Street.\n",

The impending exit, referenced in a Wednesday report from credit rating agency KBRA, equates to about a quarter of the space Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire has at the building, owned by Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge and RXR.\nFox agreed to an extension in January 2023 to stay at the property until 2042. The media empire\u2019s 1.2 million square feet there include Fox and News Corp.\u2019s corporate headquarters, as well as the New York Post and Wall Street Journal newsrooms and Fox News studio space.\nThe extension was announced as two separate long-term deals: Fox\u2019s 670,000-square-foot deal would begin in December 2025, while News Corp.\u2019s 485,000-square-foot extension would start two years later. But according to KBRA, the two entities agreed to a combined 924,000-square-foot extension through February 2042, allowing the rest of its 328,000 square feet to expire this coming November.\nCBRE\u2019s Mary Ann Tighe, who negotiated the lease extension on behalf of the tenant and said Fox\u2019s plans were known to the owner then, told Crain\u2019s that \u201cnothing has changed.\u201d The parent company of Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFox and News Corp. are expected to continue occupying half of the 1.9 million-square-foot property. Disney Streaming Services is expected to have its space sublet as it relocates to 7 Hudson Square.\nOccupancy at 1211 Sixth Avenue is expected to drop from 94 percent to 74 percent, according to KBRA, as law firm Ropes &amp; Gray is\nalso planning to leave\nbehind more than 300,000 square feet in approximately two years. The occupancy rate is expected to stabilize at 88 percent.\nIn January, Scott Rechler\u2019s RXR\nacquired a 49 percent stake\nin the building and embarked on a $300 million renovation plan, expected to last until 2028. Canadian pension fund Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec owns the majority stake.\nKBRA downgraded the $1 billion mortgage backing 1211 Sixth Avenue, citing the \u201cimpending decline in the property\u2019s occupancy.\u201d The mortgage is set to come due in August.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Their question: how FEMA can make sure stripping 6 inches of soil is enough to clear toxic substances from the blackened properties.\n\u201cThe residents of greater Los Angeles should be informed of any potential toxins in the soil as they navigate the complicated recovery process,\u201d the\nletter\nreads. \u201cWildfire survivors deserve to return to safe, toxin-free properties.\u201d\nThe Eaton and Palisades wildfires damaged or destroyed more than 13,500 properties across Los Angeles County. The resulting public health risks are too great to skimp on environmental testing, Friedman said.\n\u201cFEMA\u2019s refusal to test for toxins in the soil after wildfire cleanup in Los Angeles County is unacceptable,\u201d Friedman said in a statement. \u201cFamilies deserve to know their homes are safe and free of dangerous chemicals. This is a break from decades of FEMA precedent \u2014 and it risks exposing entire communities to long-term health threats.\u201d\nFederal cleanup crews have cleared ash and rubble from\nmore than 860 properties\n, according to the Army Corps of Engineers. About 200 rebuilding permits have been filed with local agencies \u2014 and a few have\nalready been approved\n, according to the Times.\n\nLos Angeles city and county officials say they won\u2019t require soil testing before issuing most rebuilding permits.\nWithout soil testing, many residents worry that new buildings could be built on contaminated land, increasing the likelihood that residents and workers may be exposed to toxic chemicals by inhaling airborne dust.\nEnvironmental and health officials have warned that wildfire ash from burned buildings can contain hazardous substances, including cancer-causing arsenic and brain-damaging lead. Experts warn that the pace of rebuilding shouldn\u2019t outpace necessary safety precautions.\nSoil testing in the aftermath of earlier wildfires found that a significant swath of properties still had excessive levels of heavy metals, even after cleanup crews removed a 3-to-6-inch layer of topsoil. They include the 2018 Camp fire in Northern California and the 2018 Woolsey fire near Malibu, which left properties where contaminants exceeded state standards.\nCleanup crews then returned to remove another layer of soil, and to conduct further soil testing, according to the Times.\nBut now FEMA officials insist that excavating 6 inches of soil from properties is enough to remove fire-related contamination. Anything deeper, they say, is likely to be preexisting contamination, which is beyond the agency\u2019s purview.\nThe federal agency encouraged state and local officials to pay for soil testing, if they believe it\u2019s necessary.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to show me definitive testing that shows that material below 6 inches is attributed to the fire or debris caused by the fire,\u201d FEMA Region 9 administrator Robert Fenton told the Times. \u201cI have not found that yet.\u201d\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Old Navy previously had the space. The shopping center owner declined to say when this year the new store will open.\nBloomingdale\u2019s and Ashkenazy Acquisition were each represented in-house in the deal.\nAshkenazy COO Joe Press said in a statement the addition of Bloomingdale\u2019s Outlet fits well with the center\u2019s focus on an \u201cin-demand niche in the retail market.\u201d\nThe 340,000-square-foot center has carved a spot for itself at the busy intersection of La Cienega Boulevard and 3rd Street with a tenant roster that\u2019s focused on off-price retailers.

Those locations range in size from a 24,000-square-foot location in Florida\u2019s The Avenue Viera center to a 31,000-square-foot store set for Pine Ridge Square, also in Florida. Both are slated to open in the fall.\n",

        "content": "Family offices are taking big swings in Chicago\u2019s distressed commercial real estate market, while many institutional investors are sitting on the sidelines. The family behind European alcohol giant Campari Group is leading the pack with no signs of slowing down.\nSince 2021, the firm has made over $100 million in real estate investments in Chicago across retail, office and multifamily.\nAlong with Chicago-based developer R2, Campari started construction today on the city\u2019s first publicly subsidized office-to-residential conversion, at 79 West Monroe.\nMilan-based Campari is known for spirit brands that include its namesake Campari as well as Aperol, Skyy, Grand Marnier and Wild Turkey.\nThe group\u2019s interest in Chicago comes as institutional lenders are holding back due high interest rates and Cook County\nproperty tax reforms adding uncertainty to the market\n.\nCampari\u2019s major deals in recent years include the $36 million purchase of Fulton Market food hall Time Out Market, the $21 million purchase of a boutique office building at 217 North Jefferson Street, and the $50 million spent to purchase 79 West Monroe.\nCampari Group bought the properties in cash and took mortgages out against them a few weeks later. The financing is not part of a broader strategy but gives the firm more flexibility in buying, said Massimilio Seliziato, director of Lagflin SCA, the Luxembourg-based entity overseeing the Campari family\u2019s investments and controlling shareholder of Campari Group.\n\n\u201cThey are jewels for us, and we really want to invest in them to preserve them,\u201d Seliziato said. \u201cWe know, of course, that they have a very strong connection to the city.\u201d\nAt 79 West Monroe, the developers plan to convert floors seven through thirteen into 117 residential units. The remainder of the 14-story property will be used for tenant amenities and mixed-use commercial space.\nThe adaptive reuse project is among the initial batch of properties to move forward as part of the LaSalle Street Reimagined initiative, a city-driven effort to revitalize the Loop by introducing more residential options in an area traditionally dominated by commercial spaces. The project is estimated to cost $64.2 million, with $28 million in property tax increment financing \u2014 a city-awarded subsidy that caps the cost of real estate taxes for over two decades \u2014 provided by LaSalle Street Reimagined.\nThirty-five percent of the units will be designated as affordable housing, slightly surpassing the city\u2019s requirements under the program.\nOther private investors are following Campari\u2019s lead, including other European-based family offices.\nAmancio Ortega, the billionaire founder of the Zara clothing retailer, paid more than $231 million for\na 492-unit apartment tower near Fulton Market\n, in\nthe priciest deal for any commercial property\nin Chicago in 2023.\nMore recently, the Maramotti family, which owns global fashion brand Max Mara,\nbought 41 East Oak Street\nin the ritzy Gold Coast neighborhood in late 2024. The Italian family bought the 5,000-square-foot retail building, which is leased to high-end retailer Bottega Veneta, for more than $17 million, or upward of $3,400 per square foot.",

        "content": "Federal funding delays have brought affordable housing projects across Illinois to a standstill, deepening uncertainty for developers already grappling with soaring construction costs and limited financing options.\nThe Green and Resilient Retrofit Program, a more than $1 billion Department of Housing and Urban Development initiative funded by the Inflation Reduction Act, has come under review by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, putting at least $52.5 million in grants for 15 Illinois projects in jeopardy, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nArcher Courts, a 146-unit apartment building at 2242 South Princeton Avenue in Chinatown, which was set to receive $11.7 million for green energy upgrades under the program.\nThat work is now in limbo after HUD terminated the contract of a consultant responsible for creating redevelopment plans, said Lauren Zullo of Jonathan Rose Companies, the project\u2019s developer.\nSeveral other projects, including a $39.5 million renovation of Corcoran Place and the $33.9 million Austin Renaissance complex, both in Chicago\u2019s Austin neighborhood, are also paused while developers await clarity from HUD. In some cases, work had already started, and developers are now uncertain whether they\u2019ll be reimbursed.\nA $14.5 million rehab at the Brainerd Senior Center, which had already closed on a $750,000 HUD loan, is considered more likely to receive funds, though developers say even that remains unclear.\n\nThe program\u2019s suspension follows mounting scrutiny from the Trump administration and billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, which has also targeted HUD\u2019s Fair Housing Initiatives Program.\nChicago-area nonprofits that previously received funding from the fair housing program had\ncontracts abruptly terminated\nor left pending, including at least 14 Continuum of Care organizations waiting on more than $112 million in unreimbursed HUD grants since January.\nHUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett defended the reevaluation, arguing the Biden-era emphasis on energy efficiency diverted resources from HUD\u2019s core mission. Local officials disagree, saying the funds help preserve hundreds of affordable units while improving quality of life for residents.\nAt stake is more than housing stock. Developers say project delays also threaten local jobs and destabilize future rehab efforts.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Kilroy Realty has settled a legal dispute that held up a 2.2-million-square-foot office campus atop the former Flower Mart in Central South of Market.\nThe Los Angeles-based developer settled mutual lawsuits with more than a dozen small business owners over who owned a private dead end alley, which for years had held up the 6-acre project at 610-698 Brannan Street,\nthe San Francisco Business Times reported\n.\nThe settlement, made official last month, will enable Kilroy to proceed with its plans to redevelop\u00a0 the Flower Mart at Brannan and 6th streets, while ensuring its neighbors retain their access, the court records say.\nA new cost and timeline for the development is not known.\nSan Francisco is in the\nfinal stages\nof creating a Central SoMa plan to allow developers to add more homes to office development proposals, if they so choose, according to the Business Times.\nIn 2014, Kilroy bought the Flower Mart site\nfor $70 million\n, with plans to build the 2.2-million-square-foot\noffice campus\nwith three buildings ranging from eight to 18 stories. The project was approved five years later.\nAfter years of negotiations by the real estate investment trust, the city\u2019s wholesale flower market uprooted itself late last year from its 66-year-old\u00a0 home in Central of South of Market to a\nnew home created by Kilroy\nat 901 16th Street, on Potrero Hill.\n\nMeanwhile, the San Francisco office market collapsed during a pandemic shift to remote work and Kilroy paused the redevelopment of the original collection of flower warehouses.\nThere was also an\nexchange of lawsuits\nover who owned its adjacent alley, considered key to both Kilroy and surrounding businesses. In total, Kilroy has spent $579 million on assembling a 6-acre development site.\nLast fall, Kilroy CEO Angela Aman said the\ndeveloper had no imminent plans\nto pivot away from building offices to replace the Flower Mart. The city\u2019s office vacancy now stands at 36.6 percent, according to CBRE.\nThis year, she said during an earnings call that Kilroy was redesigning the project to enable it to deliver in phases, while evaluating what mix of uses would be best for the site.\nKilroy, founded in 1996 by\nJohn Kilroy Jr.\n, has a real estate portfolio of 14 million square feet, including life sciences properties in the Bay Area, Seattle and San Diego, according to its website.\nLast month, Kilroy\nopened the second phase\nof its 3-million-square-foot Oyster Point life sciences campus in South San Francisco, now drawing financial and tech firms.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

When it doesn\u2019t succeed, they blame landlords or regulators \u2014 but never second-guess the choice to rely on rules instead of markets.\nTake the case of 2500 Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn.\nAt this 24-unit, rent-stabilized building, the landlord hasn\u2019t kept the tenants happy. He has little financial incentive to do so because the rents are capped at low rates. Tenants likely won\u2019t take their business elsewhere because finding better housing at the same price is\nvirtually impossible\n.\nMaybe the landlord,\nJonah Bamberger\nof Aulder Capital, is cold-hearted \u2014 which would be unusual for a graduate of the ultra-progressive Industrial and Labor Relations school at Cornell University, as he is. Maybe the regulated rents are just too low for him to upgrade the aging building or replace its balky boiler.\nWhich brings us to today\u2019s topic: What happens when the government eliminates market forces, only to have regulation fail in their place?\nThe pro-regulation crowd\u2019s answer is always more regulation. In this case, it\u2019s the\nAlternative Enforcement Program\n, which \u2014 as a last resort \u2014 allows the city to repair private property itself and bill the owner.\nThings got to that point at 2500 Bedford Avenue. But \u2014 and this may come as a shock \u2014 government takeovers don\u2019t always work.\nA spokesperson for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development said inspections at 2500 Bedford found improvements, notably adequate heat, after the city made repairs and fined the landlord $34,000. Yet, tenants still\nwent on a rent strike\nthis winter, citing cold apartments, leaks, mold, rats, electrical issues and fires.\n\u201cThe fines aren\u2019t working,\u201d said Rajiv Jaswa of Legal Services of NYC, one of the attorneys working with the tenants. \u201cIt\u2019s like the cost of doing business.\u201d\nIn fact, since the Brooklyn building entered into the Alternative Enforcement Program, Jaswa said, the violation count has actually increased. The two sides are now in court. Aulder\u2019s website says it is\n\u201crepositioning\u201d the property\n, which it acquired in 2015.\nJaswa blames the landlord, but the story of 2500 Bedford Ave is a reminder that when the government chooses regulation over market forces, and enforcement fails, customers cannot vote with their feet.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nCity Council members Robert Holden, Kristy Marmorato, Vickie Paladino, Joann Ariola, Susan Zhuang,\nInna Vernikov\nand David Carr, who comprise the Common Sense Caucus, are\nsuing on environmental grounds\nto stop the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity from taking effect. Do you consider these members environmentalists? Or, if you prefer to answer a different question: Will the City of Yes be good or bad for the environment? Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Lawyers at Boies Schiller sued the city on behalf of building owners seeking compensation for sidewalk sheds that encroach on their property. The firm is seeking class-action status.\n\nElsewhere\u2026\nLuxury short-term rentals startup Rove, based in New York City, says its bookings tripled after a new city law drastically reduced Airbnb listings.\nBut why? The law cracked down on rentals of shorter than 30 days when the permanent resident is not present. Rove bookings are for 30 days or more, so it doesn\u2019t seem like an Airbnb competitor.\nOne possible reason that Rove\u2019s business surged is that visitors looking for short-term stays in luxury properties are booking Rove anyway and just not using the full 30 days of the rental.\nPreviously, they would have used Airbnb, but those listings are largely gone: In September 2023, the new statute knocked the platform\u2019s listings in the city\nfrom 23,000 to just 3,700\n.\nAlso, some hosts who had been listing on Airbnb surely moved their units to other platforms and required stays of at least 30 days to comply with city (and state) law. One aim of the law is to make more units available for regular tenants, but we have seen no data indicating success on that front.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Thursday was\n$28.5 million\nfor unit 19PHC at 730 Park Avenue. The Lenox Hill co-op apartment last sold in 2019 for $17.5 million.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$5.7 million\nfor a rental property at 51 West 71st Street. The Upper West Side apartment building is five stories, five units and 5,400 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $20 million for 7 MacDougal Alley. The Greenwich Village townhome is 4,000 square feet.\nCompass\u2019\nTim Malone has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 57,909-square-foot, 10-story, mixed-use building at 103 East 29th Street. Developer Impact Equities recently acquired the property, scrapping prior plans to build a hotel in favor of this 40-unit project,\nYimby\nreported. Michael Muroff of Michael Muroff Architect is the applicant of record.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

That includes residential developments in Bel-Air and Malibu among other places that are estimated to bring more than $100 million in listings in the back half of the year, according to Carolwood.\nJoining Partridge is director of operations\nMatthew Perrye\n, in addition to agents\nSkylar Saca\nand\nJessica Blafer\n.\nThe team\u2019s move is the latest swap in Los Angeles\u2019 luxury residential market, with the Beverly Hills Estates nabbing\nJacqueline Chernov\nand her team from Compass to help build out the brokerage\u2019s Pacific Palisades and broader Westside footprint.\nThe Beverly Hills Estates declined to comment on Partridge\u2019s departure.\nAmong Partridge\u2019s recent deals is his representation in December of buyer John Saca of Saca Development in the $44 million purchase of an office tower at 101 West Broadway in San Diego from the Irvine Company.\nPartridge\u2019s resume also includes listing 940 East Oakmont in Brentwood\u2019s lower Mandeville Canyon neighborhood, which was sold to filmmaker Simon Kinberg for $15.5 million in 2021. He also represented former Geffen Records CEO and Hallwood Media founder Neil Jacobson in the $8.5 million purchase of 1387 North Doheny Drive in West Hollywood, which was owned by \u201cAvatar\u201d star Sam Worthington.\n\nThe agent and Carolwood declined to comment on his team joining the brokerage.\nBallooning business\nPartridge Estates Group\u2019s addition comes as Carolwood lapped two years in business in November. The brokerage, started by Hilton &amp; Hyland alum\nDrew Fenton and Ed Leyson\n, said it had 2024 sales volume of $3.2 billion. That\u2019s double its production in 2023.\nEarlier this month, Carolwood nabbed a spot in Forbes Global Properties network. The invite-only listings site, which did not respond to a request for comment on Carolwood\u2019s addition, has a reach of 69 countries and more than 70 million U.S. visitors.\nSeveral heavyweights to the brokerage have also benefited Carolwood\u2019s business.\nLast year alone saw the addition of\nBond Street Partners\n, which is helmed by former \u201cMillion Dollar Listing Los Angeles\u201d cast members James Harris and David Parnes. In the summer, Bond Street added\nKevin Booker\n, who was previously at Westside Estate Agency.\nLisa Optican joined the brokerage in August as estates director, bringing with her nearly $139 million in off-market listings at the time.

It later upped the proposal to 210 units.\nPlans also call for adding a 7,100-square-foot lounge and swimming pool deck on the roof.\nA cost and timeline for the redevelopment were not disclosed.\nThe mid-century concrete building, designed by Welton Becket in 1965, has been an office fixture in Koreatown for more than half a century.

        "content": "Another Biden-era housing reform has been rolled back, and it could hit Chicago homeowners especially hard.\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development rescinded a rule that allowed property owners to request a second look at an appraisal if they believed it was racially biased, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe rule, created just last spring, enabled reconsideration of value requests when appraisals appeared to violate fair housing laws or nondiscrimination standards.\nHUD Deputy Assistant Secretary Jeffrey Little cited President Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 executive order to reduce regulatory burdens as the reason for the rollback. The revised policy removes any mention of race or equity, stating instead that requests for reconsideration of value can only be made if an appraisal failed to consider known factors at the time of evaluation.\nThe move dismantles one of the federal government\u2019s most recent efforts to address racial bias in home appraisals, a well-documented systemic problem.\n\nAppraisals for Black- and Latino-owned homes are often deflated due to the race of the homeowner or the neighborhood demographic, according to research from Brookings and Fannie Mae. That devaluation hinders home equity growth, a key avenue for wealth-building.\nThe reversal could have an outsized effect in Chicago, where appraisal disparities are among the nation\u2019s worst. Only Los Angeles had a wider gap in appraised values between white-majority and minority-majority neighborhoods in 2023, sociologist Junia Howell found.\nThe rollback adds to the wave of federal housing programs recently scaled back or placed under scrutiny.\nHUD has frozen funding for the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program \u2014 a climate-focused housing initiative \u2014 and abruptly\nterminated dozens of fair housing enforcement contracts\n, including several with Chicago-based nonprofits.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "The owners of the Signia by Hilton San Jose hotel have a month to dig up enough cash to pay off a $185 million mortgage loan, or lose the property to foreclosure.\nA Santa Clara County judge gave an owners group led by Sam Hirbod until May 1 to refinance the delinquent loan secured by the 541-room hotel at 170 South Market Street, in Downtown, the\nSan Jose Mercury News reported\n. Its owners had sued to delay foreclosure.\nSuperior Court Judge Shella Deen ruled to extend a temporary restraining order that blocks lender BrightSpire Capital from foreclosing on the hotel\u2019s loan. She said the delay would benefit the hotel owners, its lender, creditors and all its workers.\n\u201cThe court is concerned that failure to provide plaintiffs with at least an opportunity to secure a new lender could pose considerable risk of harm to the hotel, its staff and junior creditors that stand to lose their interest in the property in the event of foreclosure,\u201d Deen said in her order.\nThe judge ordered the Hirbod-led group to provide a status update on April 17.\nHirbod\u2019s ownership group bought the former 805-room Fairmont San Jose in 2018 for $223.5 million, then sank $75 million more into upgrades. BrightSpire Capital originated a\n$185 million loan\ntied to the property.\nThree years later, the hotel fell into bankruptcy and closed its doors, claiming business shutdowns and travel restrictions from the pandemic had ruined its bottom line. The hotel reopened in 2022.\nIn October 2023, Hirbod\u2019s San Ramon-based Eagle Canyon Capital sold the hotel\u2019s 13-story, 264-room south tower to Mill Valley-based Throckmorton Partners for\n$73.1 million, or $276,894 per room\n, which\nconverted it to student housing\nfor San Jose State University.\n\nEagle used the proceeds to pay down part of the BrightSpire loan. In August 2023, the hotel owner was\nclose to refinancing $165.3 million in debt\n.\nIn October, Hirbod said he\u2019d\ncut a financing deal\nto save the property from foreclosure. In all, he said his group poured $170 million into the hotel, according to court filings.\nThe hotel owner told the court he\u2019s got lenders now poised to pick up the slack. He said Bridge Investment Group and Nexpoint have agreed to a mortgage refinancing package, with the new lenders \u201care expecting to close refinancing in mid-April.\u201d\n\u201cBrightSpire will be paid 100 percent of the money it is due under the loan agreements,\u201d Hirbod said in the court filing.\n\u201cWe look forward to working with you on this transaction,\u201d Jeehae Lee, manager of Bridge Debt Strategies Fund, said in a March 10 letter detailing Bridge\u2019s term sheet.\nThe Signia by Hilton has boosted its bookings for conventions, events and guests, according to Hirbod. In October, the appraised value of the Signia by Hilton was $240 million, per a previous court filing.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

It sits just south of downtown and is the office of local uniformed federal police.\nThe building is part of a shorter list of properties up for sale after the GSA abruptly pulled down\na previous list earlier this month\nthat included more than 440 buildings across the country on the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s order\u00a0 \u2014 including\nthree in Houston\n.\nThe LaBranch property isn\u2019t on that broader list, which included the Mickey Leland Federal Building at 1919 Smith Street, the Houston Custom House at 701 San Jacinto and the Alliance Tower at 8701 South Gessner.\n\nThe new list, posted March 21, includes only eight buildings nationwide, including one\nin San Antonio\n. The initiative is part of an effort to reduce the federal real estate footprint and curb taxpayer spending on vacant or underused space, the GSA said.\nThe agency said it is accepting non-binding term sheets for the list of eight and that disposing of \u201cnon-core\u201d assets would allow investment in higher-quality workspaces aligned with federal agencies\u2019 needs.\nThe downsizing follows years of shifting office usage across the country, including the impacts of remote work.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Five years ago, a $120 million home sale in Miami Beach would have been unthinkable.\nThen came the pandemic, supercharging the market across South Florida. Billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin discovered Miami. Home prices surged. The demographic got younger and wealthier. And then, sales slowed a bit. Sellers were chasing numbers that were no longer realistic.\nRock bottom was last summer.\nYet, the market for waterfront homes \u2014 and land \u2014 is back, surging in recent months. In October, David and Victoria Beckham\npaid $72 million\nfor a mansion on North Bay Road, kicking off a flurry of activity on the street. Star, Palm, Hibiscus, the Venetians and Sunset Islands, La Gorce Island, and other pockets of Miami Beach also are on the upswing.\nIn North Beach, an oceanfront home in Altos del Mar sold for $36 million.\u00a0A mansion on Palm Island traded\nfor $45 million\nin February, less than a year after it sold for $40 million.\nAnd last month, billionaire developer Vlad Doronin sold his waterfront Star Island estate for\n$120 million\n.\nAll of these deals set new records for their respective neighborhoods. Doronin\u2019s trade set a benchmark for home sales across Miami-Dade County.\n\u201cWe\u2019re sort of blown away by these numbers, but it\u2019s becoming normal,\u201d said Douglas Elliman agent Oliver Lloyd. Lloyd represented the buyer, online gaming entrepreneur Richard Skelhorn, in the\nPalm Island sale\n, and he recently represented the seller in the $22 million sale of a waterfront teardown at 4744 North Bay Road.\nThe buyers are also big names, and \u201cmany of them\u201d are out looking, Lloyd said.\u00a0Doronin sold his house, a 22,000-square-foot six-bedroom estate with a pool, tennis court and dock, to a company tied to Michael Ferro, who leads the private equity firm Merrick Ventures. Sources told\nThe Real Deal\nthat Ferro is a straw buyer, and that Griffin, a close friend of Ferro\u2019s, is the real purchaser. If true, it would add to Griffin\u2019s massive holdings on Star Island.\nAfter brand mogul Anand Khubani paid $100 million for a 2.4-acre waterfront assemblage on La Gorce Island, he spent\nanother $40 million\nin December to acquire the recently completed waterfront estate at 5970 North Bay Road. Billionaire Jamie Salter, founder, chairman and CEO of Authentic Brands Group, sold the mansion. It spans 14,520 square feet with six bedrooms, two staff rooms, a home office, movie theater, wine room, game room, wellness center and pool on the second floor.\nJan Koum\n, the billionaire founder of WhatsApp has also been quietly shopping for a mansion.\n\u201cThe money in Miami is a little less conservative, just based on the time frame of their wealth,\u201d said spec home developer Todd Michael Glaser, comparing it to the generational wealth of buyers in the competing market of Palm Beach.\nKick-starting momentum\nColdwell Banker\u2019s Danny Hertzberg, part of The Jills Zeder Group, said the Beckhams\u2019 purchase brought attention back to North Bay Road, and started a domino effect. Hertzberg was involved in the\n$35.5 million sale\nof billionaire hedge fund manager Dan Loeb\u2019s waterfront home at 6440 North Bay Road, which closed in December.\n\n\u201cEach sale set off a chain reaction,\u201d Hertzberg said. \u201cIt was a combination, to be fair, of many properties adjusting their prices.\u201d\nPrice reductions last year brought buyers back into the fold. Once many of the priciest turnkey homes sold, bidding wars ensued for properties that had previously been sitting on the market, said Corcoran Group agent Julian Johnston. Now that the\nelection\nhas passed, uncertainty that held up deals is gone, brokers say.\n\u201cEveryone else started buying because they saw inventory is disappearing,\u201d Johnston said.\nBecause of this, buyers will ask their agent to find something off-market. This has a couple of advantages for buyers and sellers, agents say.\n\u201cPrivacy is big. People don\u2019t want photographs of their houses online,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cThey want it shopped very quietly to a select group of people to see if they can take advantage of what\u2019s going on right now.\u201d\nDeveloper James Curnin said he didn\u2019t plan to sell his waterfront La Gorce Island mansion. He and his wife Jennifer spent four years building the property, which they ended up selling in March off-market\nfor $60 million\n. Brokers were \u201cconstantly reaching out,\u201d Curnin previously said. Jordan Karp brought the winning buyer.\nSpec developers are back\nMick Duchon, a Corcoran Group agent, said a few properties are asking more than $80 million off-market, and developers are included among prospective buyers. They had, for a while, backed away from the market due to the cost of land and construction.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a few developers that have successfully built and developed homes [who] continue to show interest in North Bay Road,\u201d Duchon said.\nIn the past, celebrities like Dwyane Wade, Phil Collins, Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez, Matt Damon and Billy Joel owned waterfront homes on North Bay Road. Even though celebrities continue to buy homes, it\u2019s the billionaires and the developers courting them who are now taking over.\nDeveloper Glaser, who publicized his move to Palm Beach about three years ago, is busy again in Miami Beach. Glaser is in contract to acquire the 2.3-acre property at 5940 North Bay Road for $105 million. Developer Sonny Kahn, a founding partner at Miami-based Crescent Heights, and his wife Suzanne are selling the mansion. The sale is expected to close in May.\nGlaser and his partners may try to flip the property for about $150 million. But Glaser prefers to redevelop the waterfront lot into a spec mansion that could hit the market for $300 million.\nNelson Gonzalez of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty, who plans to list the house, said the street is \u201creally the Who\u2019s Who of anyone who has purchased on Miami Beach,\u201d calling it the city\u2019s version of Park Avenue.\nGlaser said he hopes to redevelop the property into the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d of homes.\n\u201cPeople are starting to really get comfortable with that $100 million-plus sale,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like 40 years ago when the $1 million house sold. They oohed and aahed.\u201d\n",

        "content": "David Childs, the visionary architect who designed the iconic 1 World Trade Center, died on Wednesday in Pelham, New York. He was 83.\nThe cause of death was Lewy body dementia, his wife Annie told\nThe New York Times\n. Childs was a principal at the renowned architectural firm Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, where he was the only partner to serve twice as chair.\nBorn in Princeton, New Jersey, on April 1, 1941, Childs found his calling in architecture after a lecture by architectural historian Vincent Scully while studying at Yale. He shifted from zoology to architecture, earning his master\u2019s degree in 1967.\nHis most notable work, 1 World Trade Center, became a powerful symbol of resilience, rising where the Twin Towers once stood. Standing at 1,368 feet, the building was both a memorial and a testament to urban renewal. It was one of the most fraught design processes in city memory, working through five iterations before being finalized.\nThroughout his career, Childs designed numerous recognizable buildings in Manhattan, including 7 World Trade Center, the Time Warner Center and\n35 Hudson Yards\n. He was known for his versatility, rejecting a signature style in favor of designs that responded to each project\u2019s unique context.\n\u201cI know a lot of what I\u2019ve designed is not \u2018A\u2019 work,\u201d Mr. Childs admitted to the Times in 2005. \u201cBut my role was different. I wanted to raise the level of everyday development as much as I could.\u201d\n\nChilds is survived by his wife, Annie; children Joshua, Nicholas and Jocelyn; six grandchildren; and a sister, Ellyn Allison. His son Joshua saved his life in 2016 by donating part of his liver for a critical transplant.\nWhen speaking to\nThe Real Deal\nfor\nThe Closing interview\nin 2011, Childs reflected on 1 World Trade Center.\n\u201cIt does achieve many of the very largest goals originally set for it, which have to do with being in the New York tradition, a marker in the sky for the most important building down there, which is the memorial,\u201d Childs said.\nHe added, \u201cIt was very meaningful to us, and cathartic in a way, to be working on a project that we saw destroyed.\u201d\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "\u201cSouth Florida by the numbers\u201d is a web feature that catalogs the most notable, quirky and surprising real estate statistics.\nIn his recent State of the State address, Gov. Ron DeSantis formally proposed an idea he had been pitching for weeks: eliminating property taxes in Florida, which would make the Sunshine State the first in the nation to do so. Under his proposal, voters would decide the matter in 2026, just before his second and final term ends in January 2027. Is this proposal a serious attempt to bring significant financial relief to homeowners, a way to further cement his impactful legacy, or a springboard to higher office? And how will public schools and municipalities make do with billions of fewer dollars? We explore in this edition of \u201cSouth Florida by the numbers.\u201d\n$55 billion\nEstimated shortfall that the removal of property taxes would create for Florida school districts and local governments. Most of that money ($33.7 billion) goes to government and social programs like police, firefighters and jails. The rest, $21.5 billion, goes to schools. The amount of property taxes raised in Florida has doubled over the past decade.\n[MiamiHerald]\n$40 billion\nAccording to the Florida Policy Institute, the estimated amount of revenue that could be generated if Florida were to double its 6 percent sales tax to 12 percent, which would be the highest in the nation. But DeSantis has already ruled out signing into law an increase in state sales taxes to cover the cost of services currently paid for by property taxes.\n[SunSentinel]\n\n20\nFlorida\u2019s U.S. rank in the category of most expensive homeowners\u2019 median property tax amount, at $3,100. But some Florida homeowners have seen some of the nation\u2019s largest property tax hikes in recent years. In Broward County, median property taxes have jumped 57 percent since 2019, an annual increase of $1,619 and the biggest percentage gain in the nation. Home prices in Broward are up nearly 60 percent in the same period. (Property taxes in Miami-Dade County have also risen sharply, gaining 50 percent since 2019, while home values have gained 59 percent.)\n[Realtor.com]\n40 percent\nAverage increase in Florida property tax revenues over the last four years, prompting some lawmakers to sponsor other relief bills for homeowners \u2014 including one that would install a $100,000 exemption on all homesteaded and non-homesteaded properties.\n[Tallahassee.com]\n2\nNumber of hypothetical \u201ctiers\u201d recently suggested by DeSantis as a layer to his proposal, wherein Florida\u2019s tax burden could be absorbed by tourists and foreigners. Recognizing that such a system would disproportionately benefit high tourism areas (specifically mentioning Broward and Miami), he assured rural voters that tax revenue would be allocated accordingly.\n[FloridaPolitics]\nThis column is produced by the Master Brokers Forum, a network of South Florida\u2019s elite real estate professionals where membership is by invitation only and based on outstanding production, as well as ethical and professional behavior.",

        "content": "Following a busy South Florida two-year buying binge, Longpoint shed a warehouse near Miami Gardens for $43.5 million.\nAn affiliate of Boston-based\nLongpoint\n, led by founding partner Dwight Angelini, sold a nearly fully-leased 221,471-square-foot warehouse at 1400 Northwest 169th Street in unincorporated northwest Miami-Dade. The buyer is New York-based Corebridge Real Estate Investors, led by CEO Douglas Tymins, according to a press release.\nThe deal breaks down to $196 per square foot.\nA CBRE team led by Jos\u00e9 Lob\u00f3n and Trey Barry represented Longpoint, which sold the property for a nearly $15 million gain. In 2021, Longpoint paid $28.9 million for the 11.2-acre site, records show. The building was completed in 1969.\nThe warehouse is within the Sunshine State Industrial Park, an industrial complex spanning five million square feet, the press release states.\n\nLongpoint has been among the most active institutional buyers of South Florida industrial real estate. In November, Longpoint picked up a 26-property warehouse portfolio across Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties for\n$331.3 million\n, representing South Florida\u2019s largest industrial purchase of\n2024\n. Blackstone was the seller.\nIn September, Longpoint paid\n$27.2 million\nfor three warehouses in Medley, nine months after acquiring three other facilities in the same town and another trio of industrial properties in Doral for\n$30 million\n.\nLongpoint also notched South Florida\u2019s largest industrial buy of 2023 when the firm paid\n$262 million\nfor a 25-building industrial portfolio in Miami-Dade and Broward in December of that year.\nPrior to its recent acquisition, Corebridge previously acquired an industrial facility in Miami Gardens for\n$25.5 million\n. The warehouse is fully leased to Moishe Mana, one of the largest land and commercial real estate property owners in Wynwood and downtown Miami.\nCorebridge has $10.1 billion in real estate assets under management, according to the firm\u2019s website.",

Ashkenazy and Bloomingdale\u2019s represented themselves in the deal.\nThe strip mall, across the street from the Beverly Center mall, contains other discount retailers such as Saks Off Fifth, Nordstrom Rack, T.J. Maxx and Ross Dress for Less.\nAshkenazy bought the two-story, 340,000-square-foot mall in 2014 for $260 million, or $765 per square foot. He financed it with three commercial mortgage-backed securities loans from Citigroup totaling\n$210 million\n, according to CO.\nAlongside the senior loans, the investor added $35 million in unsecuritized subordinate debt secured by the property, according to Morningstar.\n\nThen the pandemic struck five years ago, and brought a plunge in foot traffic. Ashkenazy began skipping loan payments.\nSince 2020, its three CMBS loans have been managed under a special servicer, according to CO. Three years later, Ashkenazy struck a reinstatement agreement, but the debt stayed with the special servicer.\nThe value of the strip mall just fell 10 percent. This month, the property was appraised at $193 million, down from its previous appraised value of $214 million, according to Morningstar.\nAshkenazy, meanwhile, has been fighting uphill on its own turf.\nThis month, a New York judge issued a scathing decision against the investor in a Union Station legal case, saying he \u201chad sufficient resources to repay the loan but chose not to.\u201d\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "River Forest developer Marty Paris is once again in court, this time not as a defendant, but a plaintiff.\nParis sued two of his former divorce attorneys for malpractice, accusing them of abandoning him on the eve of trial and later conspiring to collect fees that helped land him in jail.\nParis, founder of Sedgwick Development, sued attorneys Brian Hurst and Olga Stambler, along with their firm Hurst, Robin, Kay &amp; Allen, as well as attorney Howard Rosenfeld and his firm Rosenfeld Farmer, the Cook County Record\nreported\n.\nThe lawsuit alleges a breach of legal ethics, claiming the lawyers improperly switched sides and worked against Paris after having previously represented him in his long-running divorce case.\nParis claims Hurst backed out of representing him just before trial in 2022, leaving him without counsel during a critical phase. That trial ended with a judgment that left Paris on the hook for millions of dollars in legal fees and settlement costs \u2014 including $1.19 million to his ex-wife and another $1 million in legal bills.\nHe was jailed three times during the proceedings, including over the 2023 holiday season, after judges found him in civil contempt for not paying court-ordered fees.\n\nThe lawsuit argues Paris was unfairly targeted and the jailings were part of a \u201cdebtors\u2019 prison\u201d scheme meant to squeeze him. The financial demands far exceeded his liquid assets, and revenue from his developments had been mischaracterized as personal wealth, it states. Judges disagreed, estimating his net worth at more than $20 million.\nThe lawsuit adds a new wrinkle: Paris alleges that Hurst not only joined efforts to collect legal fees from him, but also began representing Rosenfeld \u2014 a court-appointed attorney for Paris\u2019 children \u2014 in a separate claim for $229,000. That violated legal ethics rules, Paris alleges, since Hurst had previously been his attorney and did not disclose his prior relationship with Rosenfeld.\nThe allegations follow ongoing legal and financial troubles for Paris, who is also fighting Republic Bank over a\n$52 million loan default\ntied to a stalled River Forest condo project.\nA bankruptcy court dismissed Paris\u2019 personal bankruptcy case in January, removing protections that had previously shielded him from creditors. One lender, BDS IIII Mortgage Capital, has since demanded nearly $10 million from Paris, according to a February court filing.\nParis is representing himself in the lawsuit. Hurst and the other defendants have yet to respond in court.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

Pricing was not disclosed.\nThe portfolio sale marks Wanda\u2019s full exit from the Jeanne Gang-designed skyscraper at 363 East Wacker Drive.\nWanda originally invested in the 101-story project in 2016 alongside Chicago-based Magellan Development Group, intending to debut its first U.S. hotel under the Wanda Vista brand. But after Chinese regulations on overseas investment\ntightened\n, Wanda sold its 90 percent stake to Magellan for $270 million in 2020.\nThis latest sale follows a bulk deal last November, when GD Holdings\nbought 84 units for $117 million\n, an average of $3.16 million per unit.\n\nThe St. Regis also includes a 192-key hotel operated by Marriott International under its luxury St. Regis Hotels &amp; Resorts brand. The hotel, owned by GD Holdings and Miami-based Gencom, opened in May 2023. The condos opened to residents in 2020.\nWanda\u2019s 37 units were never listed individually prior to this, and the sale could shake up the high-end condo market downtown, where sales have been slower in the years since the pandemic.\nThe tower has seen a flurry of deals so far this year, including\none of the year\u2019s priciest\n, for two 52nd floor units at just under $9 million last month.\nJust 19 units at the tower are listed publicly, with asking prices ranging from under $1 million to $8 million. Seven have sold so far this year, according to data from Homes.com.\nWith Wanda\u2019s impending departure, the tower \u2014 once a symbol of Chinese investment in U.S. real estate \u2014 is now firmly under domestic ownership. But the bulk sale could test market appetite at the top end, at a time when high-rise luxury living in downtown Chicago has yet to fully recover.\n\n\u2014 Judah Duke",

The Dallas resort could be a model for how cities can blend public space, tourism and economic development, he said. Council Member Jesse Moreno, who represents the area, said the project could generate $2 billion in tax revenue over 30 years, funds he hopes will boost city services and public safety.\nTherme\u2019s vision includes a retractable glass roof, swim-up bars and environmentally friendly infrastructure like geothermal heating and 80 percent water recycling. A zoning change is required, and construction could begin as soon as 2027 following city approval.\nThe land is owned by Matthews Southwest, which controls surrounding parcels and part of the Water Commons. Therme has a purchase agreement contingent on entitlements, and city staff are expected to review financial incentives in the coming year.\nIf built, Therme Dallas would be the company\u2019s first U.S. location. The company plans to bring 10 wellness resorts to the United States over the next decade.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

Peisach leads Category Five with his brother, Mike Peisach.\n\u201cOur bread and butter are Class C multifamily projects,\u201d Peisach said. \u201cWe do a light to medium value-add such as replacing the roofs and putting in new vinyl floors, granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, etc.\u201d\nOnce renovations are completed at its recently acquired properties, Category Five can raise the rents by about 10 percent from the current average of $1,800 a month, Peisach said. The complexes are in unincorporated northwest Miami-Dade, bordering\nMiami Shores\nand\nNorth Miami\n.\nCategory Five acquired Blue Lake Apartments, a complex of four one-story buildings with 106 units completed 1991, in an off-market deal that also involved the buyer assuming an existing loan, Peisach said. The purchase price breaks down to $273,584 per apartment.\n\nThe seller, an entity managed by Aventura-based investor Leon Ojalvo, obtained an $11.8 million loan from Bank Leumi when he bought the 6.4-acre site for\n$15 million\nin 2021, records show.\nA Berkadia team led by Yoav Yuhjtman brokered the deal for Lake Shore Presidential Apartments, a collection of four three-story buildings with a total of 90 units, completed in 1966, Peisach said. The deal breaks down to $200,000 per unit.\nThe seller, an entity managed by Jacob Shakibpanah in Aventura and FIP Realty Services, also based in Aventura, paid $9.8 million for the complex in 2006, records show.\nEstablished in 2021,\nCategory Five\nhas been on a buying binge since late 2023 when the firm picked up a six-building apartment complex in Deerfield Beach for $24.6 million. The portfolio has grown to 600 units and includes three more properties in Pompano Beach, Launderhill and Miami\u2019s Little River neighborhood, Peisach said.\nIn addition to renovations, Category Five also installs camera security systems, and in some cases, adds amenities such as children\u2019s playgrounds, Peisach added.\n\u201cThe assets we just closed on are in a really great area,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the bones of the buildings are very good. You essentially have well-built concrete bunkers on lakes, which makes both properties very attractive.\u201d",

        "content": "The National Association of Realtors is slashing jobs at its longtime Chicago headquarters as it attempts to rebuild after scandal and structural upheaval.\nThe nation\u2019s largest trade group said Friday it would cut 61 positions nationwide, including 37 in Chicago, as part of a broader reorganization strategy, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe move represents nearly 17 percent of its total workforce. NAR had about 200 employees in Chicago as of last year, meaning the cuts represent nearly a fifth of its local staff.\nThe eliminated roles were in communications, human resources, finance and IT, a spokesperson said.\nThe cuts follow a wave of turmoil that began fall 2023 after an investigation into\nallegations of sexual harassment\nled to resignations from two successive presidents, the\nouster of longtime CEO Bob Goldberg\nand mounting internal scrutiny.\nNykia Wright, the former Chicago Sun-Times CEO who was brought on to guide the organization through the fallout, was later named CEO of NAR and completed her senior leadership team and, earlier this month, hired Matthew Cenedella as CFO, according to a news release.\nThe trade group has also been hit hard by legal and reputational blows. In October 2023, a federal jury came to a $1.78 billion verdict in an antitrust lawsuit, finding that NAR and several major brokerages had conspired for decades to inflate commissions.\n\nThe verdict prompted a sweeping industry shakeup, with NAR ultimately settling the case and agreeing to overhaul commission standards; the new required practice changes\nkicked in last August\n, though\nthe industry is split\non the full effect of its consequences.\nEarlier this month\n, a survey found NAR to be among the least-liked organizations in the industry, viewed negatively by a majority of real estate professionals and the public.\nFounded in 1908, NAR has called Chicago home for more than a century.\nIts headquarters remain at 430 North Michigan Avenue, but the scope of its presence in the city could shrink further as restructuring efforts continue.\nThe organization also maintains an office in Washington, D.C., where four positions are being cut. Another 20 vacant positions across its offices will be eliminated as well.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "It may be checkout time for Aby Rosen at\nanother one\nof his hotel properties.\nRosen, Michael Fuchs and their company RFR Holding are battling with landlord Commerz Real in three separate lawsuits over the Soho luxury hotel\n11 Howard\n.\nThe\nGerman asset manager\nfiled a petition in February to evict RFR from the 211-room hotel; A hearing is set for April 3. A new lawsuit filed this week by the landlord claims RFR owes more than $18 million in back rent, taxes, insurance and other costs.\nMeanwhile, RFR alleges in another complaint filed in January that Commerz violated its lease agreement by \u201cshopping the property around\u201d to potential buyers despite RFR\u2019s contractual right of first offer to buy the building, according to a separate lawsuit filed by RFR.\nA spokesperson for RFR declined to comment. Lawyers for Commerz did not respond to a request for comment.\nRFR bought the 114,500-square-foot, 14-story former Holiday Inn from Procaccianti Group in 2014 for $89.7 million. It says it spent \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u201d to renovate the building. The upscale hotel opened in 2016.\n\nA week after opening, Commerz bought the hotel from RFR, which included an agreement to lease the building back from the landlord for 10 years with options to extend for another 10 years and ultimately buy the building back. If RFR were to exercise its repurchase option, the Commerz investment would end up as a de facto loan.\nIn its lawsuit, RFR claims Commerz \u201cwas happy to watch [RFR] turn its building into a luxury property,\u201d then used \u201cdefective default and termination notices\u201d in order to undermine RFR\u2019s right of first offer.\nThe landlord sent RFR its first nonpayment notice in October 2023.\nCommerz, meanwhile, claims RFR racked up $18.1 million in unpaid rent and related costs by the end of January. It sent a 15-day lease termination notice on Feb. 11. In this latest suit, it is seeking to collect the money, including $2.8 million in real estate taxes that it says Rosen and Fuchs jointly guaranteed.\nAfter a rough 2024, the year has gotten off to a rocky start for Rosen. A Manhattan judge in January ruled that RFR\u2019s ground lease with Cooper Union at the iconic Chrysler Building\nwas terminated\nand ordered Rosen\u2019s company\nejected from the property\n.\nBut RFR closed in February on a\n$1.2 billion CMBS loan\nto refinance the Seagram Building at 375 Park Avenue and\nalso recapitalized\n475 Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan after facing a foreclosure threat from its lenders.\n",

Its occupancy at the time of sale was not disclosed.\n\nThe sale marks a 79 percent drop in value since just before the pandemic ushered in a broad shift to remote work, and a relative collapse in the office market across the U.S.\nView Pointe bought the office building from Lincoln Property Group in 2023 for $15.5 million.\nLincoln Property, based in Dallas, purchased it in 2019 for $74.3 million, or $1,093 per square foot.\nOffice vacancy in South OC in third-quarter 2024 was\n13 percent\n, \u201cas a variety of tenants moved into the submarket,\u201d according to CBRE.\nEarly last year, the office vacancy across Orange County hovered at\n19.6 percent\n, with 18 million square feet of empty workplaces, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield.

        "content": "The lender behind a troubled conversion in downtown San Antonio is asking a bankruptcy judge to take the project out of the owner\u2019s hands, citing mounting debt, mold damage and \u201ca pipe dream\u201d of a business plan, the San Antonio Express-News\nreported\n.\nRiverwalk Reposition Partners, an LLC that holds a $14.4 million note on 145 Navarro Street, blasted the building\u2019s owner, an affiliate of Blueprint Hospitality, in a recent court filing.\nThe affiliate defaulted shortly after refinancing the former CPS Energy headquarters, which it bought in 2021 for $19 million with\nplans to convert it\ninto a 243-room Marriott Autograph Collection hotel called El Portal.\nThe lender accused the borrower of failing to meet basic financial obligations, including paying 2024 property taxes, maintaining insurance and covering utility bills, which has left the building without electricity. Contractors and suppliers have filed about $8 million in liens while a flooded basement has led to mold growth, which has yet to be remediated.\n\u201cThis case is directionless,\u201d the lender\u2019s attorneys wrote, asking a judge to either dismiss the bankruptcy entirely or appoint a trustee with hotel development experience to take over. They described a consistent pattern of \u201cexcuses\u201d and said the company failed to offer any viable business plan.\n\nThe Blueprint affiliate filed for bankruptcy in February, listing $3 million in assets and $29.4 million in liabilities, and initially assigned no value to the Navarro Street building. The company later revised its filings, stating the property is worth $46.7 million and its total assets at $49.7 million.\nThe developer\u2019s attorney told the court they are working on organizing the company\u2019s books and securing debtor-in-possession financing to continue operations through reorganization. But the lender\u2019s attorneys said they\u2019ve received little useful information and aren\u2019t willing to extend financing without clearer oversight.\nBankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez, who denied a motion to move the case to San Antonio, will hear arguments in April on environmental remediation and potentially appointing a chief restructuring officer. The lender originally appeared on the creditor list both as secured and unsecured, but was removed as an unsecured creditor in the revised documents.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Thursday brought the beginning of\nrent guidelines\nboard season, pitting landlords and tenants of rent-stabilized housing against one another. This year\u2019s Income and Expense Study found buildings\u2019 net operating income \u2014 a measure of profitability \u2014 jumped 8 percent between 2022 and 2023 when adjusted for inflation.\nProperty owners claim the study\u2019s findings are distorted by the inclusion of irrelevant buildings. Tenant advocates, meanwhile, argue the takeaways of the report support a rent freeze.\nA major legal challenge emerged to the\nCity of Yes\nfor Housing Opportunity (which could impact the other City of Yes initiatives). More than 100 groups, City Council members, community board members and state lawmakers are asking a state court to annul the City of Yes, particularly the final rezoning expected to add 80,000 homes over the next 15 years.\nThe lawsuit, filed in Staten Island court on Wednesday, alleged that Eric Adams\u2019 administration violated city and state environmental laws by failing to do a comprehensive review of the impact of the zoning changes. A City Hall representative said the administration stands by its process.\nThis week,\nEliot Spitzer agreed to sell\na large Upper East Side rental building to Miki Naftali for over $800 million. The 208-unit property was previously marketed as a potential high-end condo development opportunity.\n\nNaftali is known for condo projects and may convert the rental building into condos, given his development history in the area. A firm plan for the property at 800 Fifth Avenue has yet to emerge, though, as the deal has also yet to close.\nNaftali can\u2019t have buyer\u2019s remorse yet. The same can\u2019t be said for the buyer of an $80 million penthouse at 520 Park Avenue, who is suing the Zeckendorf developers for fraud, alleging they failed to disclose a planned skyscraper by Extell Development that would obstruct the penthouse\u2019s Central Park view.\nThe lawsuit claims the Zeckendorfs were desperate to sell the penthouse and withheld information due to their status as real estate insiders and previous difficulties selling other units in the building. The buyer wants to rescind the sale and aims for potential damages, arguing the offering plan did not disclose the specific risk of obstruction, despite a general disclosure about potential view changes.\nAnd in Astoria, KS Group landed $300 million in construction financing to revive the long-stalled Astoria Cove project in Queens, planning to deliver more than 2,800 units across three phases.\nThe project, which dates back to 2014, faced previous financing issues and affordable housing disputes but is moving forward with mixed-use buildings, residential towers and commercial space.\n",

        "content": "Two bills backed by a landlord group aim to fill vacant rent-stabilized apartments.\nOne would allow some rent-stabilized owners to collect the full voucher amount even when the regulated rent is less than the allowable rental assistance. The\nmeasure\n, introduced this week by Sen. Leroy Comrie, would create a pilot program that would allow owners of stabilized apartments registered as vacant in 2025 to collect the full voucher amount.\nThe idea is that the promise of additional rent could help owners renovate long-vacant units and rent them out. To qualify, a building must be constructed pre-1974.\nThe pilot would apply to local, state and federal rental assistance, and would expire in 2027.\nSen. Zellnor Myrie, who is running for mayor, pitched a similar program as part of his housing platform. Tenant groups were not happy, saying it would \u201cundermine rent stabilization.\u201d Their concern is that it could incentivize landlords to push existing tenants out in order to cash in on the increase in rent.\nThe New York Apartment Association\nindicated\nin January that it would prioritize this type of legislation this session. \u201cWe welcome any efforts to get empty stabilized apartments back online and to get New Yorkers in the shelter system into permanent housing,\u201d NYAA\u2019s Jay Martin said in a statement. \u201cThis bill would be a small step towards accomplishing both of these things.\u201d\nThe group also still has its sights on a\nmeasure\nthat would allow owners to reset rents for regulated apartments that have become vacant after continuous occupancy for 10 or more years. Owners must show that they renovated the apartment, and reach an agreement with the new tenant to reset the rent (which can\u2019t be higher than the caps set by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for Section 8 vouchers). That bill, which has been pitched in different forms over the last few years, was reintroduced this week.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: It\u2019s that time of year again! The Rent Guidelines Board held its first meeting this week and released its Income and Expense\nStudy\n. Where do you think the board will land this year on rent increases? Send predictions to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nArchitect\nDavid Childs\nwas studying zoology at Yale University when he heard architectural historian Vincent Scully give a lecture and decided to change majors. Childs died this week at age 83.\n\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Gov. Andrew Cuomo withheld Covid vaccines from a facility set up at Citi Field for several weeks because he didn\u2019t like that Mayor Bill de Blasio was the one to open the site,\nPolitico New York reports\n. A spokesperson for Cuomo called the report \u201cnothing more than silly, revisionist history from a bunch of de Blasio ex-pats.\u201d\n\u2014ICYMI: Gov. Kathy Hochul floated bringing lawmakers back to Albany for a special session to address federal cuts that are not addressed in the state budget, which is due April 1,\nthe New York Times reports\n. \u201cIf and when we lose federal dollars in various categories, we are going to have to completely re-evaluate sections of the budget or perhaps the whole budget,\u201d said State Sen. Liz Krueger, a Democrat who leads the Finance Committee, told the Times.\n\u2014 Attorney General Letitia James and the Department of State are siding with the city in the Real Estate Board of New York\u2019s lawsuit challenging the Fairness in Apartment Rental Expenses Act,\nCrain\u2019s reports\n. James filed an amicus brief backing the city\u2019s argument that the FARE act does not violate state law.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Friday was\n$6.6 million\nfor a co-op unit at 211 Central Park South on the Upper West Side.\nThe Peraino Team\nat Douglas Elliman had the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$11.5 million\nfor a 15,815-square-foot office building at 449 39th Street in Sunset Park.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$37 million\nfor a 11,695-square-foot townhouse at 121 East 65th Street in Lenox Hill. Serena Boardman of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 61,535-square-foot project in Charlotte Gardens, the Bronx.

        "content": "In a significant blow for Sterling Bay\u2019s\nstruggling Lincoln Yards project\n, the Chicago-based real estate firm has conceded a substantial portion of its planned development site to lender Bank OZK.\nThe move involves transferring the northern segment of the proposed 53-acre development through a deed in lieu of foreclosure, marking a pivotal setback to Sterling Bay\u2019s $6 billion vision involving a mix of offices, housing and retail along a stretch of the Chicago River, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n, citing a Sterling Bay letter to investors.\nThe developer\u2019s CEO Andy Gloor acknowledged in the letter that the company reached an agreement with Bank OZK, a prolific construction lender based in Arkansas, to help settle a $126 million mortgage loan Sterling Bay took out against the land. The deal likely allows the borrower to relinquish control of the property while dodging a potentially lengthy formal foreclosure court process.\nThe transfer comes as Sterling Bay falters with securing financing to revitalize the project, which was slated to encompass 14.5 million square feet. Gloor cited \u201cunprecedented pressures\u201d on real estate financing markets as the cause of the difficulty, the outlet reported.\n\nThe relinquished land encompasses a 28-acre parcel once occupied by the A. Finkl &amp; Sons steel plant, with the change in ownership posing further uncertainties about the project\u2019s future, size and use. Bank OZK had extended the maturity of the mortgage multiple times, and expressed its devolving outlook on the project\u2019s viability through recent writedowns, which cut its balance to approximately $88 million by the end of 2024.\nWhile Sterling Bay had been in talks with various prospective financial partners to inject additional cash into the project, including the\nChicago Teachers\u2019 Pension Fund\nand investment firm\nKayne Anderson\n, efforts to secure a deal faltered, prompting Bank OZK\u2019s action. The lender confirmed its intention to market the property to new sponsors.\nDespite the setback, Gloor conveyed optimism about Sterling Bay\u2019s ongoing involvement in Lincoln Yards\u2019 future. The company had previously sought to consolidate ownership under a single entity, aiming to overcome challenges posed by the early exits of its initial backers \u2014 J.P. Morgan Asset Management and Dallas-based Lone Star Funds \u2014 as well as regulatory hurdles.\nLincoln Yards was approved by Chicago\u2019s City Council in 2019 under former mayor Rahm Emanuel, and faced additional delays attributed to financing disputes with the preceding administration of former mayor Lori Lightfoot. Efforts to secure infrastructure funding through a proposed bond deal encountered setbacks due to rising interest rates and ultimately exacerbated tensions between the developer and city officials.\n\u2014 Sam Lounsberry",

        "content": "When it comes to fundraising for who can win the race for Oakland mayor this spring, former Rep. Barbara Lee has outperformed former Council member Loren Taylor.\nLee and groups supporting her have raised about $694,000, while\nTaylor\nand his supporters raised $488,000, a 42 percent gap,\nthe San Francisco Chronicle reported.\nThe dollars will be used to pay for online advertisements, direct mailers and campaigns to replace former Mayor Sheng Thao, elected in 2022 and recalled on April 15 last year.\nThe contributions include all fundraising through March 1 and donations exceeding $1,000 through March 24.\nLee, viewed as the front-runner in the race because of her\nwidespread name recognition\nas a former congresswoman, depends on support from city unions and building trades that heavily backed Thao in 2022, plus Pacific Gas and Electric Company and support from outside the city.\nTaylor\u2019s support has come predominantly from individual Oakland residents and backers of the recalls of Thao and\nformer Alameda County District Attorney Pamela Price\n, according to the Chronicle.\nLee is politically progressive. Taylor is a moderate who\nnarrowly lost the 2022 mayoral race\nto Thao. She was\nrecalled by voters in November\nand then\nindicted on federal bribery charges\n.\n\nTaylor has criticized Lee for relying on labor groups that fueled Thao\u2019s campaign for mayor. Lee has said that she will not disparage Taylor\u2019s supporters, and that her support comes from across all groups.\n\u201cThe recall forces in Oakland feel like Loren Taylor\u2019s their candidate,\u201d Jim Ross, a political consultant based in the East Bay city, told the Chronicle. \u201cHe really has fully embraced that slice of the political community in Oakland for his campaign.\u201d\nThe largest contributions to the Lee campaign were $150,000 from the California Nurses Association Political Action Committee; $51,000 from the Service Employees International Union Local 1021; and $50,000 from the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers Local 21, according to the Oakland Public Ethics Commission.\nThe largest donations to the Taylor campaign were $67,000 from the Revitalize East Bay Committee; $51,000 from Ronald Nahas, a partner of Rafanelli and Nahas, a developer based in Lafayette; and $21,000 from Marty Glick, an adviser to the Golden State Warriors.\nThe election nears as the city confronts a budget crisis and concerns about crime, with residents unhappy with the state of the city.\nThree out of four respondents to an October poll by the Oakland Chamber of Commerce felt Oakland was headed in the wrong direction, nearly 10 percent more than\nprevious chamber polls\n, according to the Chronicle. A\ncity survey released\nthis month shows that satisfaction with local government is at a record low.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "Neiman Marcus\u2019 decision to close its century-old flagship store in downtown Dallas is not so final after all.\nThe store\u2019s parent, Hudson Bay Company subsidiary Saks Global, has decided to keep the store open through the end of this year, and is considering \u201ca reimagination of the location in collaboration with the City of Dallas\u201d after that, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nCity Manager Kimberly Bizor Tolbert met with Saks Global CEO Marc Metrick this week to pitch a \u201cfinancially beneficial\u201d plan for Neiman Marcus to stay in the store, at 1618 Main Street, which opened in 1907 and is part of the city\u2019s identity as a major retail destination. City Council member Paul Ridley, whose district includes downtown, has said the city is open to using economic development funds on the store.\nBut how much of Dallas taxpayers\u2019 money Tolbert offered Saks to keep its declining store open wasn\u2019t reported.\nIt seems to have been plenty, because a couple of weeks after making the \u201cfinal\u201d decision, the Saks CEO said this: \u201cWe deeply admire the city\u2019s passion and unwavering dedication to Neiman Marcus\u2019 storied legacy in Dallas. The potential reimagination of this iconic shopping destination reinforces Saks Global\u2019s commitment to redefining the luxury shopping experience.\u201d\nThis reimagination could mean \u201ca luxury retail experience, a curated art exhibition and a fashion and event center,\u201d or an incubator for fashion design and manufacturing, the outlet said.\nShoppers since last Christmas have noticed the store\u2019s dwindling merchandise and bare-bones staff of employees on the sales floors. It was a far cry from the bustling days when Neiman Marcus had its offices in the building, and executives could walk down to the store and experience the merchandise first hand.\nCity leaders apparently didn\u2019t wake up to what was happening with the store until after Saks Global said it was exiting its massive lease at City Place and planned to close the downtown flagship on March 31. Saks first used the excuse of an\nexpiring land lease\n, but after city leaders\ncleared that up\n, it said the decision to close the store was \u201cfinal\u201d anyway.\n\nNeiman Marcus is exiting\n82,000 square feet\nof office space at 2711 North Haskell Avenue. But Saks Global is meanwhile investing $100 million in the Neiman Marcus store at the thriving NorthPark Center.\nHere\u2019s what else happened in Texas real estate news this week.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s administration released a second list of just eight federal buildings they want to sell off nationwide on an \u201caccelerated\u201d basis. It\u2019s not clear whether an earlier list of over 400 buildings, which was posted and then removed from the U.S. General Services Administration\u2019s website, is still part of the administration\u2019s downsizing plan. One of the two Texas buildings listed for accelerated sale is the 163,000-square-foot building at\n727 East C\u00e9sar E. Ch\u00e1vez Boulevard\nin San Antonio, which is in the path of where city leaders are considering building a new arena for the Spurs. The other is the 75,000-square-foot\nLaBranch Federal Building\nat 2320 LaBranch Street in Houston. None of\nDallas\u2019 federal buildings\nmade the short list.\nIn other Trump administration news, Houston-based real estate investor\nTilman Fertitta\nsaid he would resign from his business empire, which includes\u00a0 Wynn Resorts\u00a0 if he is confirmed as ambassador to Italy and San Marino.\nTexas Attorney General\nKen Paxton\nis investigating a Dallas-area master-planned community being developed by an entity tied to the \u200b\u200bEast Plano Islamic Center, citing state consumer protection laws as a basis for unspecified reasons for the probe.\nAn\nEuropean spa resort\nwith an eye-popping $800 million price tag is coming for a sleepy corner of central Dallas. Meanwhile, the $325 million\nHarold Simmons park\ninside the Trinity River levees could finally be moving forward and is expected to result in $1 billion of related real estate investment.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

The brokerage plans to lean on Chernov and her team to build a presence in the Pacific Palisades as the community there rebuilds and then, longer term, when high-end sales bounce back.\nChernov, who was behind last year\u2019s priciest sale in the Palisades in over a year, hailed from Compass.\nLater in the week, Carolwood Estates nabbed\nMick Partridge\n\u2019s team from the Beverly Hills Estates. The agent comes to the brokerage, which has been quietly and quickly scaling, with residential and commercial business. Partridge\u2019s group estimates residential development deals in the pipeline will bear out in more than $100 million in listings later this year.\nThe estimate is likely welcome news as Carolwood looks to continue a growth streak that saw its 2024 sales volume double to $3.2 billion.\nBel-Air manse first of $100M-plus deals this year\nWestside Estate Agency\u2019s Kurt Rappaport and Carolwood Estates\u2019 Drew Fenton are behind this year\u2019s first trade of over $100 million.\nThe power agents represented Australian billionaire James Packer, who told a local outlet he plans to move into his new Bel-Air estate mid-year after agreeing to pay $110 million for \u201cLe Belvedere\u201d at\n630 Nimes Road\n. He\u2019s coming home to quite the pad: a practically brand-new build with 10 bedrooms, 15 bathrooms and pools inside and outside, among other amenities.\nOne industry source sees the deal as a good indication of the ultra-luxury segment\u2019s health: \u201cThe high-end market in L.A., $100 million-plus, is back.\u201d\nBloomindale\u2019s takes lease at Ashkenazy Acquisition\u2019s Beverly Connection\nLook no further than the Beverly Connection for the latest sign that retail\u2019s off-price channel is still going strong and benefitting landlords with space to lease.\n\nThe outdoor shopping center owned by\nAshkenazy Acquisition Corporation\nat the corner of La Cienega Boulevard and 3rd Street landed a 20,000-square-foot lease with Bloomingdale\u2019s Outlet. Bloomie\u2019s discount door will absorb space previously occupied by Old Navy and is set to open later this year.\nFor Beverly Connection, the lease is the latest win in a retail corridor where the center\u2019s bound by chains, luxury brands and boutique shops. Joe Press, chief operating officer for Ashkenazy Acquisition, said the center\u2019s newest tenant \u201cfits in seamlessly\u201d with a roster \u201cfilling an in-demand niche in the retail market.\u201d\nVenice\u2019s Binoculars Building hangs up for-sale sign\nOne of Venice\u2019s most notable offices is on the sales block.\nFrank Gehry\u2019s Binoculars Building\n, which comes in at 78,578 square feet and currently has Google as its tenant, has been placed on the market by W.P.

        "content": "San Francisco\u2019s rejuvenated spring luxury market was the subject of much focus this week, from the long-awaited sale of the city\u2019s most expensive listing to a quick trade on ESPN analyst and former Warriors GM Bob Myers\u2019 Presidio Heights home.\nMyers and wife Kristen bought the 6,300-square-foot six-bedroom, four-bathroom and two half-bath home at\n200 Laurel Street\nin April 2016 for $10.3 million and sold it for $12.6 million, according to property records.\nListing agent Janet Schindler listed the home for $12.9 million on Jan. 22 and it was in contract on Feb. 21, according to Redfin. Schindler declined to comment on the sale, citing a non-disclosure agreement. Mapache Listo LLC, which was represented by Tyler Stewart of Heath Real Estate, was the buyer.\nStewart told\nThe Real Deal\nher clients already had a home in Presidio Heights and a very narrow area that they were looking at for a larger home amid extremely limited inventory.\n\u201cIn this specific location, which is essentially a four-block radius, you get maybe one house a year,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when those houses come up, it is obviously a very lovely home, but it\u2019s really location driven.\u201d\n$1M over asking in Presidio Heights\nLocation was also key to the sale of a home just around the corner at\n3333 Jackson Street\n, which went more than $1 million over the $6.5 million asking price, despite the fact that it had a \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d level of work to be done, according to Compass agent John Townsend, who represented the buyers. He said that for years having a house in the city that needed \u201csome TLC\u201d was seen as a \u201ctough sell,\u201d but that buyer mindsets seem to be changing this year.\nListing agent Ted Bartlett of Compass said that he and his co-listing agents \u201ccarefully priced\u201d 3333 Jackson, which had been in the same family for over four decades.\n\u201cWe knew potential buyers would be excited about the opportunity and compete for the opportunity to make it their family home,\u201d he said, adding that it went into contract after just eight days on the market.\nSF\u2019s most expensive listing sells for $26M\nWhile some high-end northside homes are selling in just days, San Francisco\u2019s most expensive listing\nfinally sold\nafter about 10 months on the market.\n\nBrokers Joe Lucier and Stacey Caen of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty listed the home of the late philanthropists Fritz and Lucy Jewett for $38 million last June, dropped the price to $32 million in October and sold it for $26.5 million on March 25. It was the first time the 10,200-square-foot property at the top of the Lyon Street Steps next to the Presidio has traded hands since it was built in 1987.\nPete Rodway of Compass represented the buyer and couldn\u2019t comment specifically on the sale due to a non-disclosure agreement but said, in general, \u201cWe have not seen this level of buyer activity since the fever pitch market of 2022, which continues to be fueled by local buyers in the tech sector and adjacent industries.\u201d\nDefault imminent for Berkeley\u2019s largest hotel\nIn addition to the San Francisco residential news, Berkeley\u2019s hospitality industry also hit the headlines when\nTRD reported\nthat the $48.3 million loan on the city\u2019s largest hotel and biggest waterfront tenant was headed toward default, according to Morningstar. The 378-room DoubleTree Berkeley Marina had a debt service coverage ratio of just .34x last year and has been below issuance since the pandemic, according to Morningstar.\nHong Kong-based\nJunson Capital\n, the family office for Chinese billionaire Cai Kui, has owned the waterfront hotel since 2014 through 200 Marina LLC. The loans in question were originated by Wells Fargo and UBS in 2017 and packaged into a commercial mortgage-backed securities offering that year.\nBingdong Zhao, the New York-based head of Junson\u2019s Real Estate Investment Division, is listed as the manager of 200 Marina LLC in city documents. He did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\nReceiver asks for more time to close Park Hotels debt sale\nIn further hotel debt news, after\nTRD reported\non March 6 that lenders had found a mystery buyer for Park Hotels\u2019 $725M debt sale, the\nreceiver asked the courts\nthis week for more time to close the deal.\n\u200b\u200bVirginia-based\nPark Hotels walked away\nfrom the 1,921-room Hilton San Francisco Union Square and 1,024-room Parc 55 San Francisco in 2023 and Eastdil began marketing the debt for sale last July.\nThe deal originally needed to close by March 31 in order to avoid going back to lender JP Morgan Chase for foreclosure. Receiver Michelle Russo of HotelAVE asked a San Francisco court to extend the sale deadline to May 20.\nRusso\u2019s sale extension request states, \u201cthe Receiver has made substantial progress on a sale of the hotels to a third party\u2026 and believes she will be in a position to file a motion to approve the sale imminently.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Miami Beach\u2019s luxury home market hit rock bottom last summer. It\u2019s back.\nWe\u2019ve been reporting on deal after deal, at record prices. The latest big one, billionaire Vlad Doronin\u2019s sale of his waterfront Star Island mansion for\n$120 million\n, got everyone talking.\nThe calls I received?\n\u201cDo you know who the real buyer is?\u201d\n\u201cWhat brokers were on that deal?\u201d\n\u201cI heard it\u2019s not who you reported.\u201d\nMichael Ferro, a private equity multimillionaire, is named on the deed as the buyer. But Ferro is friends with Ken Griffin, the billionaire we all know and who owns a lot of land on Star Island. Sources told me that Griffin is the real buyer of Doronin\u2019s property.\nRegardless, the trade is indicative of\nwhat\u2019s been going on\nin recent months across Miami Beach\u2019s most exclusive areas: the islands, such as Star, Palm, La Gorce and the Venetians, as well as prominent streets like North Bay Road. (The WSJ reported that the roughly 150 waterfront homes there are collectively worth more than $1.7 billion.)\nA handful of agents have said in recent weeks that price adjustments led to the first couple of big deals.\n\u201cEach sale set off a chain reaction,\u201d Coldwell Banker\u2019s Danny Hertzberg said.\nThe first domino to fall was David and Victoria Beckham\u2019s $72 million purchase of 4736 North Bay Road in October. A mansion on Palm Island traded for $45 million in February, less than a year after it sold for $40 million. In March, developer James Curnin sold his waterfront La Gorce Island mansion off-market for $60 million.\n\u201cWe\u2019re sort of blown away by these numbers, but it\u2019s becoming normal,\u201d Douglas Elliman agent Oliver Lloyd told me. Lloyd represented the buyer, online gaming entrepreneur Richard Skelhorn, in the Palm Island sale.\nThe market of five or 10 years ago is gone. The buyers are much wealthier than before, and many are big names. They\u2019re looking for off-market deals, in part because they require privacy and also because a lot of the most desired homes have been purchased already.\n\nTodd Glaser is among the developers looking to raise the price ceiling even higher \u2014 think more than double the price of Doronin\u2019s trade. He\u2019s in contract to acquire developer Sonny Kahn\u2019s 2.3-acre site on North Bay Road for $105 million.\nGlaser\u2019s preference will be to redevelop the waterfront lot into a spec mansion that could hit the market for $300 million, he said. (This is up from the previously reported planned price of $250 million.)\n\u201cPeople are starting to really get comfortable with that $100 million-plus sale,\u201d he said.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nI wrote about the allegations surrounding\nMarcy Javor\n, an agent in Boca Raton, as well as the state\u2019s investigation into complaints filed against her. Do you have a similar story? Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\nSpecial thanks to Kate Hinsche for writing the rest of this newsletter!\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential:\nBillionaire media mogul Ric Elias sold his oceanfront Palm Beach mansion for\n$73 million\nin an off-market deal. The nearly 12,900-square-foot mansion was built in 2018 and spans eight bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, four half-bathrooms and a pool. Douglas Elliman\u2019s Jack Rooney represented both sides of the deal.\nCommercial:\nAcadia Realty Trust\npaid $68 million\nfor Pinewood Square, a shopping center at 6330 Lantana Road in Lake Worth Beach. The seller is a joint venture between Woolbright Development and Principal Asset Management.\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nWeatherTech founder David MacNeil listed an 11,700-square-foot mansion at 84 Isla Bahia Drive in Fort Lauderdale for $45 million. Built in 2020 on half an acre with 300 feet of waterfront, the home has five bedrooms, eight bathrooms, four fireplaces and six wet bars, the listing shows. It\u2019s on the market with Amy Carpenter of DuPont Registry Realty. MacNeil sold an oceanfront Fort Lauderdale mansion for $40 million in 2023, and bought an oceanfront Manalapan estate for\n$38.5 million\nlast year.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\nJack McMullen, childhood friend of\nTRD\u2019s\nKate Hinsche, made his Opening Day debut as the Miami Marlins lead radio announcer this week,\ncalling the play-by-play\nfor the team\u2019s first win of the season against the Pittsburgh Pirates.\nElsewhere in Florida\nRelated Ross chairman Steve Ross is teaming up with eMerge Americas and the Florida Council of 100 on an initiative to make South Florida an \u201cinnovation hub,\u201d\nSouth Florida Business Journal\nreports. Ross is boosting the region, specifically West Palm Beach as the \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d of tomorrow, and is building office towers and wooing over institutions like Vanderbilt University and the Cleveland Clinic to bring his vision to life.\nParents of the Parkland school shooting victims are condemning a bill that would lower the minimum age for purchasing a firearm in Florida to 18, from 21. The Florida House passed the bill, and it likely has Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 support, according to\nCBS News\n.\nLawmakers in Tallahassee are gearing up for a battle over tax cuts,\nAxios\nreports. Gov. Ron DeSantis has proposed eliminating property taxes statewide and House Speaker Daniel Perez has pitched slashing the sales tax as well. The State Senate isn\u2019t likely to support both cuts, according to Axios.",

        "content": "In late 2022, the state legislature offered some relief to owners of certain affordable housing projects: They could collect the full voucher amount on apartments where the rent was less than the value of the rental assistance.\nBut the rollout was slow. One affordable housing provider said that thousands of applications for the program have been waiting several months to be processed.\n\u201cIt was this great thing that popped on the scene, and everyone was excited,\u201d the provider told\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cBut the result is different from what anyone was hoping for.\u201d\nNow, the relief is fully cut off.\nHPD\nannounced\nthat it is not accepting new applications from landlords seeking to collect the full voucher amount in their buildings under Section 610 of the Private Housing Financing Law. The agency\u2019s website points to \u201cthe current situation created by the uncertainty at the federal level,\u201d noting that federal funding is limited and must be stretched across all public housing agencies in the U.S.\nThe \u201ccurrent situation\u201d may be uncertain, but there are some major known challenges.\nCongress approved a stop-gap budget resolution this month that increased funding for Section 8 contract renewals, but not enough to keep up with rising costs. By some\nestimates\n, it could result in the loss of 32,000 vouchers.\nIn the last two months, payments to New York landlords accepting Section 8 vouchers were\ndelayed\n. The first delay, in January,\nresulted\nfrom confusion around whether President Donald Trump\u2019s order to pause federal grants and other government programs applied to rental assistance, given that the New York City Housing Authority receives Section 8 payments from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nActions on the federal level are not the only challenges at play.\nBy City Hall\u2019s count, some 11,000 households in city shelters that have vouchers through the City Family Homelessness and Eviction Prevention Supplement, or CityFHEPs, cannot find housing. The cost of the program will reach more than $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2025,\naccording to the Citizens Budget Commission\n. One of Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 key arguments against the City Council\u2019s expansion of CityFHEPs was that costs would balloon and create even more competition for limited housing. A court sided with Adams in August, and the Council appealed.\n\nGiven this climate, it wasn\u2019t surprising that a new discretionary program like Section 610 would be put on ice. From the program\u2019s launch, HPD\ncautioned\nthat its application could be disrupted if the available subsidies became too strained.\n\u201cWe kind of saw this coming,\u201d said Rachel Fee, executive director of the New York Housing Conference. \u201cThe agency doesn\u2019t have good options right now.\u201d\nStill, it\u2019s a hit to some of the most vulnerable rent-regulated properties.\nGov. Kathy Hochul signed Section 610 into law in December 2022. In its guidance for owners, HPD indicated that Section 610 was \u201cintended to help the most financially troubled, regulated affordable housing developments.\u201d\nIt permitted affordable housing owners to request permission to collect the full voucher amount, either through a local or federal program, even if it is higher than the legal rent of a unit (without affecting what the tenant pays). Voucher holders pay 30 percent of their income toward rent, and government subsidy covers the rest, up to a \u201cfair market rent\u201d set by HUD. Those thresholds differ in some parts of the city that calculate caps on a zip code level.\nOnly owners with regulatory agreements with the city or state that require affordable housing are eligible. The city excluded new construction from Section 610 and specified that projects that solely had affordable units through the city\u2019s Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program or the property tax break 421a were not eligible.\nOwners often try to close on their projects by June, the end of the city\u2019s fiscal year. One attorney said some clients were hoping to secure Article XI by that time (a tax exemption for new projects and rehabs that have an affordable housing agreement with HPD) and, by extension, be eligible for Section 610.\nHPD\u2019s announcement may kill those projects.\nThere may be some hope. The New York Apartment Association, a group that represents rent-stabilized apartments, is pushing a bill at the state level that would fill in for Section 610. The measure, introduced last week, would temporarily allow some stabilized owners to collect the full voucher amount.\n",

        "content": "One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s\ntop commercial broker\nwas back in Miami-Dade criminal court last week.\nManny Chamizo entered a no contest plea to a misdemeanor stalking charge and was sentenced to a year of probation, in a case in which the state alleged Chamizo stalked and harassed the former owners of a commercial property in Coral Gables.\nHe was also ordered to stay away from the victims, Eddy and Adriana Fernandez, for a year.\nChamizo faced a felony stalking charge, but the state reduced it to a misdemeanor.\nChamizo was\naccused of sending threatening\ntext messages, letters and other mail to the Fernandezes. An affiliate of Miami-based One Sotheby\u2019s sued the Fernandezes\u2019 All in One Investment Properties in 2020 for a commission on the 2019 sale of the office building at 3251 Ponce de Leon Boulevard.\nCoral Gables Mayor\nVince Lago\n\u2019s former brokerage joined the lawsuit as a plaintiff and settled his part in 2022. Lago is friendly with Chamizo, whom he has\nre-appointed\nto the city\u2019s Waterway Advisory Board over the years. Chamizo is in his fourth term, which ends this summer. Chamizo has contributed to Lago\u2019s campaign: A company controlled by Chamizo and his wife cut a $500 check to Lago in 2020.\nThe lawsuit, which remains open, alleges that Chamizo (and Lago) were owed a 2 percent commission on the sale, and that Eddy Fernandez secretly went behind the brokers\u2019 backs to continue negotiating and ultimately close a deal without them.\nChamizo\u2019s attorney, Brian Tannebaum, said that now that the criminal case is closed, \u201cthe Fernandezes still owe Mr. Chamizo the money they owed him over 4 years ago.\u201d\nChamizo did not respond to a request for comment.\nAdriana Fernandez told\nThe Real Deal\nthat the civil dispute \u201cquickly turned into a relentless, agonizing nightmare\u201d that occurred while her husband was being treated for cancer.\n\nOne letter Chamizo allegedly sent included a matchbox with a single burnt match and a note reading \u201cWe can get to you.\u201d\nAll of the letters, she said, were sealed with a label that read: \u201cWhy are you not dead yet so we can f**k your wife already?\u201d\n\u201cIt was a constant barrage of threats and disturbing messages, which he sent not just to my husband, but also included my young daughter and me,\u201d she said.\nThe Fernandezes said they were shocked by the judge\u2019s sentencing, which they called lenient.\n\u201cThe outcome that we expected was for him to have some time in jail. Unfortunately, we were in this process for three-and-a-half years to end up with this type of ruling,\u201d Eddy Fernandez told\nTRD\n. \u201cThat said, at least Chamizo, who has done so much damage to us emotionally and mentally, has a year of probation and a record of stalking and the stay away orders. We know for a fact once the stay away order has lapsed, he won\u2019t have any guardrails.\u201d\nThe family also filed a lawsuit against One Sotheby\u2019s in June.\nChamizo has hung his license with Daniel and Mayi de la Vegas\u2019 One Sotheby\u2019s\nsince 2017\n. He\u2019s consistently the firm\u2019s top commercial broker, and held that title as recently as last year.\nOne Sotheby\u2019s did not respond to a request for comment.\n\u201cThis was all for a real estate transaction. That\u2019s what\u2019s really disappointing. MDLV [One Sotheby\u2019s legal entity] kept him,\u201d Adriana Fernandez said. \u201cThey kept somebody that harassed a family while their husband was trying to survive, because he had stage IV cancer, even though there was proof it was coming from [Chamizo\u2019s] house.\u201d\n",

It\u2019s on track to surge much higher this fiscal year to $50 billion, according to data compiled by the Real Estate Board of New York. Commercial real estate is the main driver, accounting for 82 percent of property tax revenue generated in the city.\n\u201cThrough the pandemic, changing workplace trends and volatile macroeconomic pressures, the real estate sector continues to be the backbone of New York City\u2019s economy and revenue base,\u201d REBNY president James Whelan told the Post.\nReal estate-related tax revenue was the top source of municipal tax revenue last year, accounting for nearly 50 percent of that total. Percentage-wise, that\u2019s a slight dip from the previous fiscal year.\nNevertheless, real estate-related taxes continue to surge in the city. Since 2010, such taxes have increased by 100 percent. Over that same period, the city budget only increased by 89 percent.\n\nThe tax revenue generated through the real estate industry last year was enough to pay the total wages and salaries of 280,000 municipal workers, such as transit employees or police officers. Approximately $5 billion in transfer taxes went towards the MTA\u2019s Capital Lockbox, a fund earmarked for MTA capital projects.\nProperty taxes are the largest revenue source for the city\u2019s police, fire and sanitation services.\nThe overall tax-assessed value of the city\u2019s properties\nincreased\nby $2.5 billion over four years, according to a state comptroller report released last summer, hitting $204.8 billion.\nUnfortunately for office owners, tax-assessed values don\u2019t necessarily reflect actual sales values.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "David Werner is doing one of the things he does best: flipping deals.\nThe investor is in talks to sell the office floors at 300 East 42nd Street, only a few months after he went into contract for\n$52 million\n, sources told The Real Deal.\nThe building fronts an entire block of Second Avenue between East 42nd and East 41st streets and has three retail spaces with about 7,300 square feet on the ground floor. Werner\u2019s plan is to buy the retail portion of the 18-story building and flip the office floors above for essentially the same price he agreed to pay for the entire property.\nWerner is said to be in talks with several potential buyers, including a high-net-worth individual from Latin America. A representative for Werner could not be reached for comment.\nHis David Werner Real Estate went into contract earlier this year to buy the 235,000-square-foot building from Fortress Investment Group, which took the property back from Keith Rubenstein\u2019s\nSomerset Partners\nand Jeffrey Kaplan\u2019s\nMeadow Partners\nback in 2023.\nThe previous owners had bought the building in 2019 for $122.5 million, making Werner\u2019s contract a nearly 60 percent discount off that price.\nThe deal is a quintessential example of the David Werner playbook. The prolific investor is known for tying up properties and then flipping them to his investors, sometimes rolling his profit back into the deal as equity.\n\nIn 2004, Crain\u2019s called him the \u201c\nKing of the quick flip\n.\u201d\nWerner is also known for opening up his checkbook when prices are low. Over the past two years, he\u2019s been one of the most active buyers, snapping up buildings at hefty discounts.\nLast year, he teamed up with Lloyd Goldman\u2019s BLDG to buy the office building at 100 Wall Street for\n$115 million\n\u2014 a deep discount to the $270 million the seller Barings paid in 2015. It\u2019s one of several office-to-resi conversions Werner is working on.\nHe also bought 40 Fulton Street in 2022 for\n$101 million\nafter the seller, Vornado Realty Trust, had been eyeing at least\n$130 million\nfor the property. In Chicago, he teamed up with 601W in January to buy the distressed office building at 303 East Wacker for $63 million. The 30-story building previously sold for $182 million in 2018.\nWerner is working with Nathan Berman\u2019s Metro Loft Management to convert the former Pfizer headquarters at 235 East 42nd Street into 1,600 apartments \u2014 the largest-ever office-to-residential conversion.\nThe two are also planning to convert the 340,000-square-foot office building at 675 Third Avenue, which they signed a contract in January to buy from the Durst Organization for more than $100 million.\n",

He is suing Lalez for allegedly firing him in retaliation for speaking out and violating the whistleblower act in doing so.\nCimino alleged that Lalez, who leads a team of about 29 other agents, regularly received cash payments in exchange for \u201creferring and steering\u201d clients to work with a particular lender and attorney, a violation of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act or RESPA.\nThe lawsuit also claimed Lalez did not report these payments in annual tax filings, nor did he let clients know he was receiving them.\nCimino, who joined the Ben Lalez Team in May 2021, allegedly complained to Lalez about the \u201ckickbacks\u201d in June of last year and refused to participate in the alleged practices, according to the lawsuit.\nLalez allegedly fired Cimino less than six months later, which Cimino claims was in direct retaliation for his decision to speak out as there were no performance-based reasons for his termination.\nCimino claimed Lalez even admitted this in a note sent to him after his firing, though a note has yet to be produced as evidence in the case.\nAttorneys for Cimino have asked a Cook County Circuit Court judge for at least $50,000 in damages and anything else Cimino may be entitled to, which could include backpay with interest and Cimino\u2019s reinstatement to his former position with the team.\nLalez and his attorneys did not respond to requests for comment. A Compass spokesperson said the company doesn\u2019t comment on active legal matters. Cimino\u2019s lawyer Michael Leonard did not respond to requests for comment.\nA Circuit Court judge gave Lalez until April 4 to file a response to the allegations in an order handed down earlier this month. The two parties are set to meet for a case management hearing on April 24.\n\nHow NAR\u2019s antitrust settlement changed the playing field\nRESPA is a federal law passed by Congress in the \u201970s, when interest rates were high and instances of consumer fraud were increasing, revealing a need for more consumer protection measures in the industry, said real estate attorney Kelli Fogarty, of Fogarty &amp; Fugate.\n\u201cYou hire a real estate broker; you hire a lender; you hire an attorney; and you expect those professionals to be working in your best interest,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, if they suddenly have behind-the-scenes deals going on together, that\u2019s a bit of a conflict.\u201d\nFogarty said she has noticed an uptick in this kind of alleged consumer fraud since the National Association of Realtors\u2019 $418 million settlement of antitrust lawsuits changed industry norms around commission splits between listing and buyer\u2019s agents and barred commission splits from being advertised on multiple listing services.\n\u201cIt made an opportunity for those who might not want to be on the up-and-up to start playing with things that were well-established and weren\u2019t really things that could be played with before,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have a vacuum where there once was a very established procedure.\u201d\nWhile the intent behind the lawsuit was good, \u201cthe settlement itself basically allows for the Wild West, because people are creating all these new ways of managing commissions and payments and money,\u201d Fogarty said.\nThere are various ways that real estate professionals could circumvent RESPA protections or take advantage of some of the \u201cgray areas\u201d surrounding the federal law, she said. While the receipt of cash payments or gifts in exchange for client referrals is a cut-and-dried RESPA violation, kickbacks that come in the form of activities, like paying for a round of golf, or that form part of a relationship between two professionals can be harder to parse through.\nIt often takes a whistleblower speaking out to catch violations in those instances, she said.\nCimino\u2019s allegations against Lalez, if proven true, are \u201cyour most straightforward RESPA violation, if [Lalez] didn\u2019t perform any services other than the referral,\u201d Fogarty said.\nWhile violations of RESPA can be prosecuted criminally, that only happens in the most extreme cases, said Fogarty, who is also a former prosecutor. In most cases, an alleged violation of RESPA results in civil or regulatory action, or both. That could be a state attorney general or an affected client suing real estate professional or their company to seek fines and other penalties.\nAs Cimino was not directly affected by any alleged violations of RESPA, his lawsuit against Lalez is limited to his alleged firing from the team. It is unclear whether further litigation may be brought against Lalez related to the alleged \u201ckickbacks,\u201d but no other civil cases have been filed against him in Illinois.\n",

        "content": "Juan Soto is Steve Cohen\u2019s $765 million man, but State Sen. John Liu is providing the New York Mets owner with something every baseball fan needs this time of year: hope.\nOver the weekend, Liu announced he would sponsor a parkland alienation bill for Cohen\u2019s proposed casino complex in the parking lot west of Citi Field in Flushing, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The bill is necessary because the parking lot is technically city parkland, requiring intervention at the state level.\nIt\u2019s a moment of palace intrigue for the state legislature, which typically defers to the wishes of the local lawmaker on land use decisions \u2014 in this case, mayoral candidate Jessica Ramos; Liu represents the neighboring district. Ramos previously\nrefused to take up\na parkland alienation bill, apparently dooming Cohen\u2019s $8 billion Metropolitan Park project.\nOther legislators would still have to fall in lockstep with Liu to pass the bill. He said he believes he has sufficient support for a bill to pass the legislature and discussed with Ramos before announcing his decision. Ramos, for her part, released a statement decrying the casino possibility in her district and sticking to her position in opposing parkland alienation, ostensibly\nin line with community members\n.\n\nLiu said he came out in support of the plan for the 50-acre site after the addition of a park in the style of the High Line spanning Flushing Creek and reaching downtown Flushing.\nThe legislature adjourns in June, giving little time for the bill to get passed and coming shortly before applications for a downstate casino license are due. The City Council, meanwhile, already approved a parkland alienation measure for the site.\nCohen and bid partner Hard Rock signed a binding agreement to fund $100 million in infrastructure upgrades to Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Cohen\u2019s proposal also includes a hotel, live music venue, food hall and 20 acres of public park space; he has said he won\u2019t build any of it without securing a gaming license.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Former Anaheim Mayor Harry Sidhu will do two months in the clink for slipping confidential information to the Anaheim Angels in a public corruption case that killed a $320 million stadium deal.\nA judge sentenced Sidhu, 67, to two months in a federal prison for obstructing federal investigators in a public corruption probe that ultimately killed the 151-acre stadium sale to the owner of the MLB baseball team,\nthe Orange County Register\nreported.\nThe ex-mayor was also given a $50,000 fine and one year of probation. He must turn himself in on Sept. 2. According to a guilty plea\nagreement\nin 2023, Sidhu had faced more than 50 years in federal prison for his crimes.\n\u201cI do believe the defendant did betray the city of Anaheim while serving as mayor,\u201d U.S. District Judge John W. Holcomb said in a courtroom at the Ronald Reagan Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in Santa Ana. \u201cThere are consequences to those actions. That breach of trust warrants a term of incarceration.\u201d\nProsecutors had accused Sidhu of lying to FBI agents about not expecting to receive anything from the stadium deal, despite secret recordings of him saying he hoped to secure a $1 million campaign contribution.\nThey also accused him of destroying an email in which he provided confidential information about city negotiations to a team consultant.\nSidhu\npleaded guilty\nto four felonies: obstruction of justice, wire fraud and two counts of making false statements to a federal agency. He also admitted trying to avoid paying California sales tax for a used helicopter he purchased for $205,000 using an Arizona mailing address.\n\nThe court admission had come more than 15 months after the Anaheim City Council\nvoted to nix the $320 million deal to sell Angel Stadium\nbecause of the corruption scandal involving the former mayor that included misconduct and pay-to-play schemes.\nArte Moreno, owner of the Anaheim Angels, and his firm, SRB Management, had negotiated with the city to buy the stadium to redevelop its parking lot into offices, hotels, shops, restaurants and more than 5,000 homes. Critics accused the city of agreeing to sell the stadium for less than it was worth.\n\u201cWe appreciate the court\u2019s thoughtful hearing and the government\u2019s detailed investigation,\u201d Paul Meyer, one of Sidhu\u2019s attorneys, said in a statement after his client\u2019s sentencing. \u201cHarry has expressed his apology for his actions.\u201d\nHolcomb found that Sidhu had breached the public trust. He then handed down a lower sentence than the eight months requested by prosecutors, citing Sidhu\u2019s age, his decision to step down from political office quickly and his subsequent cooperation with federal investigators.\n\u201cIt is significant for anybody to be incarcerated for any length of time, and this is what is warranted,\u201d Holcomb said.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Mayor Lisa Gillmor said the new signal would back up traffic, especially during events at nearby Levi\u2019s Stadium.\n\nThe council decided to further review the signal.\nOver the past several years, Santa Clara has altered its general plan for its 108-acre Freedom Circle Focus Area from commercial to a high-density, mixed-use neighborhood of 3,600 homes.\nIn 2022,\nSouth Carolina-based Greystar\nwas approved to build a 1,100-unit complex on a 13-acre lot at 3905 Freedom Circle, next to the Irvine Company site.

The site at 410 East Fifth Street was formerly home to Avenue Lofts and has already been cleared. But Wilson Capital President Taylor Wilson said the numbers no longer pencil.\n\u201cSomething\u2019s got to give,\u201d he said, pointing to elevated interest rates, sticky construction costs and\nan oversupplied apartment market\n.\nThe apartment market has shifted drastically from pandemic-era highs. Vacancy in the metro stood at 15.2 percent at the end of last year, according to CoStar data. Even a modest improvement would meaningfully shift the math for downtown residential development, Wilson said.\n\nAverage rental rates plummeted 12.5 percent from a two-year high of $1,640 in mid-2023 to $1,435, as of February. Austin has added 36,000 apartments over the past year but only 19,000 units were absorbed.\nThe developer also hit pause on its 30-story tower at 2500 Braker Lane near Q2 Stadium, as well as Concordia,\nan 11-story, 256-unit\nbuilding planned for 1010 Concordia Avenue. All three projects have active permits, and Wilson said his firm will be ready to go when financial conditions improve.\nFor now, the firm is focusing on suburban projects and land development, where the economics are more favorable.\nDowntown demand hasn\u2019t gone anywhere, Wilson said. The challenge lies in getting lenders and investors back on board with high-rise development.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Lynd and its partners scored a $132.5 million refinancing for their newly finished 401-unit apartment complex at Royal Palm Beach\u2019s Tuttle Royale mixed-use development.\nThe San Antonio, Texas-based firm this year completed Villas at Tuttle Royale with 26 three-story buildings and 55 townhomes for rent at 11200 Nicole Drive, according to a Lynd news release. The complex includes detached garages and carports, as well as two-car garages for the townhomes.\nNew York-based Declaration Partners and Hillsboro Beach-based Tuttle Land Investments, led by Brian Tuttle, were equity investors in the development and remain project partners, Lynd CEO David Lynd said.\nMF1 Capital provided the loan, which refinances the project\u2019s\n$126 million\nconstruction loan secured in 2023 and raises it by $6.5 million, records show. New York-based S3 Capital was the construction financing lender, with Declaration also providing preferred equity.\nVillas at Tuttle Royale is 40 percent leased, Lynd said. It offers one- to four-bedroom apartments, with monthly rents ranging from $2,120 to $4,489, according to its website.\nThe complex is part of the roughly 200-acre Tuttle Royale mixed-use development on the southwest corner of Southern Boulevard and U.S. 441.\nTuttle\n, a longtime land assembler, is Tuttle Royale\u2019s master developer, assembling the tract since 2013 and securing approvals for the entire project.\nOver the years, he sold portions of Tuttle Royale. The Fanjul family\u2019s FCI Residential is developing a\n320-unit\napartment complex at Tuttle Royale. Also, the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related Group completed the 392-unit The Point at Southern Boulevard apartment complex at Tuttle Royale in 2019. It sold the complex to Pantzer Properties for\n$119.4 million\nin 2021.\n\nFor his part, Tuttle had previously said that building portions of Tuttle Royale would mark his debut as a developer. But recently, he sold one of the sites and faces financial woes on the other property.\nIn November, K. Hovnanian Homes paid\n$19 million\nfor the parcels where Tuttle had wanted to develop 100 single-family homes. The true price is closer to $23 million, including payouts Tuttle will receive from the sale of each completed home and offsite improvements, Tuttle said.\nIn July, a lender\nsued\nTuttle and his affiliates alleging a default on $38.4 million in loans for Main Street, planned for 750,000 square feet of retail; a 150-key hotel; 400-unit apartment complex and garages. In December, Tuttle said he had signed an equity partner to help build Main Street and resolve the foreclosure lawsuit. The case is still open, court records show.\nCompletion of Villas at Tuttle Royale comes as South Florida faces a\nmultifamily\nsupply overhang. Developers completed a record\n18,600 apartments\nin the tri-county region last year, outpacing 15,000 new leases signed, according to CoStar Group. This has led to slower lease-ups and concessions at some complexes.\nDemand is expected to catch up to supply this year due to a drop in construction starts. Yet, data shows a slowdown of the influx of out-of-staters, which could lead to a longer lasting supply overhang.\nMultifamily\nrefinancings\ncontinue to flow in South Florida. Last month, Cymbal DLT scored a\n$114 million\nrefinancing for the 341-unit Laguna Gardens apartment complex, which is a Live Local Act development at 20775 Northwest 17th Avenue in Miami Gardens. That came on the heels of David Martin\u2019s Terra landing a\n$291 million\nrefinancing for a 470-unit apartment complex and the adjacent renovated Centro City Plaza in Miami. The projects mark the first phase of Terra\u2019s Centro City mixed-use development on the northwest corner of Northwest Seventh Street and Northwest 37th Avenue near the Little Havana neighborhood.\n",

At the closing of that deal, Joshua Pack and Drew McKnight, formerly managing partners at Fortress, became the co-CEOs. Fortress\u2019 long-time CEO Pete Briger moved to a chairman role.\n\nBriger and Stuart joined Fortress at the same time in 2002.\nStuart is based in New York City and Pack and McKnight\u2019s office is in Dallas, which shifted the center of power at Fortress to Texas, according to a source familiar with the matter.\nStuart was behind several momentous transactions at Fortress, but his\ndeal\nwith Harry Macklowe in 2007 remains legendary. Macklowe sought to acquire 7 million square feet of office space from Blackstone Group with just $50 million of his own money. He had a $1.2 billion hole to fill in his financing and needed to raise the money in two weeks.\n\u201cIt was an absurd amount of money to come up with so quickly.

After Lehman Brothers collapsed, Macklowe defaulted on his loans and lost most of his office holdings.\nStuart is leaving on good terms, and the decision was mutual, per sources.\n",

        "content": "Michael Swerdlow and Related Urban are one step away from landing separate ground leases to develop mixed-income projects on land owned by Miami-Dade County.\nThe county commission is set to vote on both deals on Tuesday.\nSwerdlow\n, who heads his eponymous Coconut Grove-based firm, is planning a mixed-use project in Miami\u2019s Little River neighborhood with 5,730 apartments. More than half the units will be set aside for affordable and workforce housing. The remainder will be \u201cpotential workforce condo units,\u201d a Swerdlow spokesperson said.\nRelated Urban\n, the affordable and workforce housing division of Coconut Grove-based Related Group, is planning a riverfront mixed-use project with 236 apartments in Miami\u2019s Spring Garden neighborhood. Nearly half the units would be set aside for low income residents, and the other half would be designated workforce housing units. Related Urban is led by Albert Milo.\nSwerdlow\u2019s Little River project financials\nUnder a 99-year ground lease,\nSwerdlow\nwould pay the county $5.3 million in annual lease payments, and 30 percent of the estimated $37.6 million developer fee. Should Swerdlow sell or refinance the development, Miami-Dade would receive 16 percent of the proceeds, a county memo states. Miami-Dade staff estimates the ground lease could generate $9.6 billion to the county over 99 years.\nSwerdlow would demolish five existing public housing complexes at 520 Northwest 75th Street, 7200 Northeast Miami Court, 7101 Northeast Miami Court, 7200 Northeast Second Avenue and at the intersection of Northwest 71st Street and Northwest First Court. The low-rise buildings with a combined 314 apartments were completed between the 1950s and 1970s, records show.\n\nThe developer would provide new apartments for current residents from the 2,284 planned affordable housing units in the new project, which will also have 1,398 workforce housing units; 370,000 square feet of commercial space such as offices and a school; 250,000 square feet of open space and amenities; and a new Tri-Rail passenger train station.\nIn 2023,\nSwerdlow\nwas the sole developer that responded to a county competitive process to redevelop five of 10 public housing properties. The firm and Nashville-based AJ Capital are also planning a separate mixed-use project with 2,100 market-rate apartments and 293,000 square feet of retail on land AJ Capital owns near the five housing complexes.\nRelated Urban Spring Garden project\u2019s financials\nIn another 99-year ground lease,\nRelated Urban\nwould pay Miami-Dade an annual rent payment of $1.2 million, a 16.5 percent share of the project\u2019s annual net operating income and an estimated $4.5 million developer\u2019s fee, a county memo states. Over the life of the 99-year lease, the county would receive an estimated total of $280.2 million.\nRelated Urban is planning Gallery at Riverwalk, a 19-story building on a vacant 1-acre site at 1175 Northwest South River Drive. The 108 apartments set aside for affordable housing would include 36 units for former residents of a shuttered downtown Miami public housing building, a county memo states. To qualify for the affordable housing apartments, residents can only make up to 80 percent of the county\u2019s average median income of $79,400.\nGallery at Riverwalk would also entail 1,550 square feet of retail and 188 parking spaces.\nRelated Urban\nwon a competitive bid for the development site last year, county records show.",

        "content": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is pushing forward with his plan to cut property taxes for Florida homeowners.\nDeSantis\nannounced a proposal to provide rebates averaging $1,000 for the more than 5.1 million homesteaded properties across the state. The rebates would be provided in December. \u00a0They \u201cwould cover state-mandated school property taxes \u2014 ensuring full school district funding,\u201d according to a press release issued by the governor\u2019s office.\nThe governor has publicly backed a plan to eliminate property taxes, which would require at least 60 percent voter approval via a constitutional amendment. If eliminated, about\n$55 billion\nin funding for public services, such as police, fire and schools would be dramatically affected.\nThe\nFlorida Legislature\n, which would have the authority to pass a rebate, may be heading in a different direction. House Speaker Daniel Perez pitched reducing the sales tax by 0.75 percent, which would save Florida taxpayers about $5 billion annually, the\nMiami Herald\nreported. It\u2019s unlikely that lawmakers would support the sales tax cut and the elimination of property taxes. The legislative session ends May 2.\n\nFlorida Senate President Ben Albritton wrote in a letter to senators that he liked both DeSantis\u2019 and the House\u2019s proposals, but that a tax cut package of this size should be \u201cpredominantly non-recurring.\u201d\n\u201cCutting taxes now does little good if they have to be raised two years from now to address budget shortfalls,\u201d Albritton wrote. \u201cNo one wants a repeat of the Great Recession, and we\u2019ve done our best to avoid that by reigning in spending, paying down debt, and setting aside significant reserves.\u201d\nReducing ineffective spending and waste is important, he said, but he noted that \u201cthere is a cost associated with maintaining our transportation, clean water, and health care infrastructure, ensuring universal school choice for every family,\nhurricane\nresponse and recovery, and of course public safety.\u201d\n",

        "content": "While Los Angeles rebuilds after the January wildfires\ndevastated\nthe Pacific Palisades and Altadena regions, some of its wealthy residents aren\u2019t returning; they\u2019re starting fresh in the Lone Star State.\nThe state\u2019s business-friendly environment has long lured Californians to Texas, but the recent natural disaster has been a catalyst for affluent Angelenos feeling disillusionment with L.A. leadership, a desire to live in a more conservative state and a yearning for closer ties with neighbors, realtors said.\n\u201cEverybody feels like it was not handled and addressed properly, that it wasn\u2019t properly prepared for,\u201d said L.A. realtor Hana Cha, founder of Advisory Studio by HANA. It\u2019s like, \u201cOK, what do you mean there\u2019s no water in the fire hydrants?\u201d\nDallas-based Pogir Pogir of Briggs Freeman Sotheby\u2019s International Realty said that Palisades clients he\u2019s met with are especially attracted to upscale neighborhoods like Highland Park and University Park, where the median listing home price is $3.5 million and $2.4 million, respectively, according to Realtor.com. Meanwhile, the median listing home price in the Palisades is $6.4 million.\nAlthough home prices are not as big of a concern for the more wealthy, they do play a part in general migration patterns of Californians to Texas. Between 2009 and 2023, nearly half a million Californians moved to Texas, with cheaper housing being a main draw, according to a recent Realtor.com\nreport\n.\nBerkshire Hathaway HomeServices\u2019 Matt McIntyre\u2019s clients \u2014 a couple under 40 \u2014 sold their home in Pasadena and moved to Dallas, even though their home was not directly affected by the wildfires.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that it was a direct result of the wildfire, but I do think the Eaton fire gave them that moment of pause,\u201d McIntyre said. \u201cThey thought, \u2018This might be the right time.'\u201d\nIn the aftermath of the fires, Angelenos are blaming local government, Pogir said.\n\u201cThey want to get away from it because they just don\u2019t see it improving,\u201d he said.\nFrustration also comes from Los Angeles\u2019s red tape, according to Cha. Texas is an attractive alternative, given that development in the state takes less time, she said.\nTexas is meeting the intense demand for housing with a\nbuilding boom\n, meanwhile, it took two months for L.A. to approve permits to\nrebuild just three homes\nin the Palisades.\n\u201cWe have a conversation about building something for 10 years and then it\u2019s like, OK, but it\u2019s not gonna happen,\u201d Cha said. \u201cIn Texas, they talk about it for 10 days and they have a shovel in the ground in 10 months.\u201d\nLocal municipalities in Texas are \u201cvery pro-development,\u201d said Catherine Lee, Douglas Elliman\u2019s president of new development in Texas. \u201cOur cost of construction tends to be lower \u2026 So you\u2019re starting to see an influx of developers that are out-of-town developers coming into Texas because they can make those numbers make sense.\u201d\nA big part of the issue is zoning, said James Jacobson, senior vice president of sales in California for Douglas Elliman\u2019s development marketing group.\n\u201cTexas has more lenient zoning laws, which creates opportunities, where California doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said.\nHe cited working with the California Coastal Commission on seaside developments as a \u201cwhole other level of bureaucracy.\u201d For some of the projects he\u2019s working on, \u201cI\u2019ll be retired by the time they go for sale,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking seven to eight years down the road. It\u2019s pretty crazy.\u201d\nDallas-Forth Worth permitted more housing than all of California last April, according to a Pacific Research Institute\nreport\n, which attributes the gap to better urban planning, occupational-licensing policies and a lower cost of living in Texas.\n\nSome wealthy L.A. residents are moving to Texas for the red state\u2019s conservative culture, specifically a perceived emphasis on family values and a strong police presence, according to multiple real estate agents.\nThis comes despite the fact that violent crime is down in L.A., according to the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s\n2024 end-of-year crime statistics\n.\nPogir shared one incident in which Dallas police notified his out-of-town client that their water was running more than usual and discovered a running toilet; he said this situation would be unlikely in L.A.\n\u201cWe have a very strong, very good police force in Highland Park, University Park,\u201d Pogir said. \u201cThey really are on top of things. Their reaction time is incredible.\u201d\nIn Austin, crime in the city was down through the first part of 2024 after seeing a rise during the pandemic, Austin Police Department\ndata\nindicates.\n\u201cA huge part of my issue was simple safety,\u201d said former Entertainment Tonight host Lauren Zima, who lived in Los Angeles for 10 years before moving to Austin with her husband, former\n\u201cBachelor\u201d host Chris Harrison. She said she experienced long wait times when calling the police in Studio City.\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary to feel like you\u2019ve paid your taxes and done your part, but you aren\u2019t safe where you live,\u201d she said.\nCompass\u2019 Carrie Benuska Leinen, a native Angeleno who moved to Austin two years ago and now helps clients make a similar relocation, said she now never feels like she has to lock her doors. The sense of community safety has been a \u201ctradeoff\u201d when it comes to politics in Texas, she said.\n\u201cI see myself as a centrist, and I found myself annoyed by the super, uber \u2014 I don\u2019t like really extreme on either side \u2014 liberal politics,\u201d she said, noting that it felt like it was \u201cshoved down [her] throat\u201d in California.\nWhile she doesn\u2019t stand behind all of Texas\u2019 conservative policies and noted the lack of diversity in certain neighborhoods, she appreciates the freedom from the pressure to be politically correct.\n\u201cWhen I lived in California I felt like there were all sorts of taboo topics,\u201d she said. \u201cI have millennial kids who\u2019d be like, \u2018You can\u2019t say that, that\u2019s not OK.\u2019 I feel much less that way here.\u201d\nThe appeal of conservatism also bleeds into these Angelenos\u2019 perception of the school systems in Texas, said Compass\u2019 Elena Licari. She\u2019s heard that some people with kids are looking to put them in \u201cmore traditional\u201d schools.\nBeyond concerns with everyday living in L.A., some are exiting the city because they feel there\u2019s nothing to return to post-wildfires and are looking to start new in a state experiencing\nsignificant growth.\nPigor said of his clients, \u201cThey were not going to stay in the Palisades. They were not going to deal with all that. They have accepted that it\u2019s never going to be the same.\u201d\nThe quaint architecture of Altadena\u2019s 100-year-old homes \u201cis gone,\u201d Benuska Leinen said. \u201cAltadena is gone, all the businesses are gone, all the houses are gone. \u2026 I can just see homeowners saying, \u2018I don\u2019t have it in me [to rebuild].\u2019\u201d\nLicari, who was a firefighter in San Jose for 17 years before relocating to Austin with her husband, a Bay Area builder, likens the post-wildfire exodus to the migration that happened during the pandemic. In 2021,\nroughly 110,000 people\nmoved from California to Texas.\n\u201cMaybe because the Covid levels were higher in California, people felt scared and people felt on edge,\u201d Licari said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what a lot of my friends and people that are relocating are feeling right now \u2014 that there\u2019s a lot of heavy energy in L.A., because there\u2019s been so much loss and there\u2019s so much trauma from what\u2019s happening there, that heaviness they want to escape.\u201d\n",

        "content": "One of the nation\u2019s top appraiser training organizations is facing allegations of fraud, potentially impacting thousands of professionals across the country.\nAlissa Akins, former director of education and publications at the Appraisal Institute, sued the Chicago nonprofit, accusing it of knowingly submitting inaccurate test scores to state regulators for at least five years, Bisnow\nreported\n.\nThe Institute oversees mandatory education and testing for real estate appraisers nationwide. Akins uncovered the alleged scheme last year. She claims the group used a single standardized pass/fail threshold for every U.S. state despite each having its own score requirements.\nAs a result, some appraisers were marked as having failed when they should have passed, and others were reported as having passed despite falling short of their state\u2019s standards, the lawsuit claims.\nAkins was fired in December after raising the alarm internally and refusing to be complicit, she alleged.\nThe Appraisal Institute, which administers Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice testing, the core certification requirement for appraisers, has not publicly commented on the allegations. Critics have long viewed the requirements as overly burdensome.\nThe lawsuit paints a picture of leadership more focused on avoiding operational headaches than regulatory accuracy. In one alleged exchange, the nonprofit\u2019s interim CEO ordered Akins not to investigate, and that the matter fell under a \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d type of policy, the suit said.\n\nThe alleged incorrect scores were distributed to state agencies, including Illinois\u2019 Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, and used to grant or deny professional licenses, according to the lawsuit.\nThe lawsuit follows other leadership turmoil at the Appraisal Institute.\nLast fall, its board ousted CEO Cindy Chance, who said she was also pushing for reform. She later said Akins\u2019 claims aligned with her own experience at the organization, where she was hired to address deep-rooted problems in testing and education oversight.\nThe Appraisal Institute is one of the country\u2019s most influential providers of continuing education for appraisers, along with McKissock Learning in California. However, it faced a $1.2 million budget deficit last year.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "A second Harwood International office property is facing foreclosure less than three months after the firm saved Saint Ann Court from auction with a last-minute recapitalization.\nThe local developer defaulted on an $80 million mortgage tied to Harwood No. 4, a 20-story office building at 2828 North Harwood Street, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service. Square Mile Capital, which merged with USAA Real Estate in 2023 to become Affinius Capital, provided the loan in 2019.\nThe auction is scheduled for Tuesday morning.\nThe 221,000-square-foot Harwood No. 4 was built in 2000. The debt works out to $363 per square foot. The property was valued at $80.8 million last year, records show. Law firm K&amp;L Gates\nsigned\na deal last summer to occupy 23,000 square feet at the property.\nHarwood could avoid losing the property, as it did with\nSaint Ann Court\nearlier this year. That 25-story office building at 2501 North Harwood Street was set to be auctioned on Jan. 7, but Harwood reached a deal with Life Company to recapitalize the property. With the fresh financing, Harwood repaid its $138 million mortgage.\n\nRegardless, the foreclosures indicate Harwood International, one of Uptown\u2019s largest office property owners, is struggling to pay its debts.\nThis comes as Harwood embarks on its\nlatest development\n, a speculative office tower known as Harwood No. 15. The 24-story office building will be located on Wolf Street near Harry Hines Boulevard.\nTrouble at the company could rock the area becoming known as the headquarters of \u201c\nY\u2019all Street\n\u201d and provide space for new office operators to gain a foothold in the hot submarket.\nUptown will be the recipient of $1 billion in investment via NorthEnd, a Hunt Realty project that will include a $500 million campus for Goldman Sachs, and Parkside Uptown, a Pacific Elm building that will house Bank of America.\nHarwood didn\u2019t respond to TRD\u2019s request for comment in time for publication.\n",

        "content": "The fight over a ground lease on Billionaire\u2019s Row will not play out in court, at least for now.\nA state court judge on Monday handed\nanother\nvictory to land owners Ruby Schron and David Werner, throwing out the Carnegie House co-op board\u2019s lawsuit seeking to halt negotiations over a new ground lease and overhaul certain rent-stabilization codes.\nIn his order, Judge Arthur Engoron agreed that the board\u2019s challenge was \u201cpremature\u201d given that the parties haven\u2019t finished arbitration yet to determine the new ground rent.\nThe ground lease at Carnegie House, a 324-unit cooperative at 100 West 57th Street, expired March 15. The lease was renewed \u2014 but the land owners, a joint venture tied to\nSchron\n\u2018s Cammeby\u2019s International Group and David Werner Real Estate, and the co-op board have yet to agree on a new rent.\nThe two parties have been at odds specifically over the rent price increase. In initial discussions, the owners indicated that arbitration would likely result in a new rent of about $40 million, 10 times the current rate. The board came back with $5.4 million and then increased the offer by $50,000, according to court filings. The owners then pitched $25 million.\nThe board and Georgetown 57, an LLC that controls the building\u2019s retail space, filed a lawsuit in September asking the court to temporarily halt ground lease negotiations. The complaint argued that the state must first sort out the board\u2019s rights if the co-op is ultimately converted into rent-stabilized housing. Under\nstate rules\n, if the co-op is dissolved or a new lease is approved but the residents are unable to pay the new rent, the building is converted to rent-stabilized apartments. The lawsuit alleged that state codes for setting initial rents allow for \u201cunsustainable and unconscionable levels\u201d and should be changed.\nIn November, the judge declined to issue a preliminary injunction to stall arbitration and indicated that he didn\u2019t think the lawsuit would survive scrutiny. Now, he has dismissed the case, agreeing with the owners that the lawsuit was challenging hypotheticals.\n\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s do not have standing to challenge a rent regulation that to this point, and no doubt not for several future points, if ever, has or will cause them any concrete harm,\u201d Engoron wrote. \u201cThus, the instant case is premature and asks for an impermissible advisory opinion.\u201d\nThe judge also cited a\n2005 decision\nthat established that the effect of rent stabilization should not be considered when calculating rent for a ground lease. The judge in that case stated that \u201ceconomic hardship is not a reason to rewrite a lease made between two sophisticated commercial entities.\u201d\n\nThe board could appeal the decision, though it did not reveal its next moves.\n\u201cOur fight isn\u2019t over until all ground lease co-ops are protected from predatory landowner practices,\u201d Richard Hirsch, president of the board, said in a statement.\nThe co-op\u2019s shareholders have also been\nlobbying\nfor state legislation that would cap rent increases on ground leases and guarantee renewals. Sen. Liz Krueger and Assembly member Linda Rosenthal\nreintroduced\ntheir versions of the measure in January, and have indicated that the bills are a priority this session.\nThe Real Estate Board of New York has said the effort would \u201clegislate a windfall for some of the wealthiest New Yorkers while throwing contract law into chaos.\u201d\nAn attorney for the co-op board said Monday\u2019s decision underscores the importance of such legislation.\n\u201cThe decision magnifies the arbitrary nature of the current code, and highlights the need, in the absence of judicial relief, for legislative action as soon as possible,\u201d Tim Collins, an attorney for the board, said in an interview.\nCollins was disappointed by Monday\u2019s decision, but was heartened by the judge\u2019s acknowledgement that conversion of the co-op building \u201cwould restore the units to rent regulation, but would allow [the] owner to offer initial leases at [unmodest] market rates,\u201d which the lawsuit argued was anathema to the point of rent stabilization.\n",

        "content": "Gazit Horizons acquired a grocery-anchored shopping center near Fort Lauderdale\u2019s oceanfront for $35.4 million, doubling its South Florida retail portfolio.\nAn affiliate of Gazit Horizons, the Miami-based U.S. arm of Israeli real estate firm\nGazit Globe\n, paid $35.4 million for Galt Ocean Marketplace at 3700 and 3800 North Ocean Boulevard, according to a press release. Anchored by a Winn-Dixie supermarket, the 105,589-square-foot shopping center is 96 percent leased. Other tenants include CVS, Holy Cross Hospital, McDonald\u2019s, Flagstar Bank and Sherwin Williams.\nThe deal breaks down to $335 a square foot.\nThe seller, an affiliate of Palm Beach Gardens-based Kitson &amp; Partners, acquired the 8.6-acre site for nearly $26.7 million in 2006, records show. The retail building was completed in 1988.\n\nThe Galt Ocean Marketplace purchase marks the second retail acquisition for Gazit Horizons, led by CEO Zvi Gordon, in a three-year span. In 2022, the firm dropped\n$20.1 million\nfor a fully leased retail building in Miami\u2019s Brickell neighborhood.\nGazit Horizons owns a stake in\nMaizon Brickell\n, a 19-story apartment building with 262 units completed by ZOM Living in 2019, according to a press release. The firm also owns a 0.5-acre development site near Brickell City Centre that Gazit Horizons acquired for\n$29.5 million\nin 2017.\nGazit Horizons is planning Brickell Gateway, a 62-story tower with 504 market-rate apartments, more than 18,000 square feet of ground-floor and second-floor retail space and 344 parking spaces. Gazit Globe owns 89 properties across the world spanning 1.8 million square feet and valued at about $10 billion, the release states.\nIn December, Palm Beach Gardens-based Kitson &amp; Partners sold Plaza Del Mar, a Publix-anchored shopping center in Manalapan, to Short Hills, New Jersey-based Garden Commercial for\n$37 million\n. Other tenants include Soma fashion shop, Illustrated Properties and Art Basil Restaurant.",

        "content": "An alleged data hacking case brought by \u201cMillion Dollar Listing Los Angeles\u201d agent Josh Flagg has been quietly winding its way through court with no known defendants \u2014 until now.\nThe Compass agent is accusing his former boss, ex-Douglas Elliman Western Region CEO Stephen Kotler, of being involved in the hacking after the identity, up until now, was only known as \u201cDoe 1\u201d in the lawsuit. The request to amend the suit was filed earlier this month.\nKotler was a long-time Elliman CEO up until a February\nshake-up\nof the region\u2019s executive ranks. At that time, he stepped down to join his son Max Kotler and brother Michael Kotler on Elliman\u2019s New York-based Kotler Team, according to an internal memo reviewed by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nPeople familiar with the matter said Kotler had been negotiating an exit from the position \u2014 which oversaw California, Texas, Colorado and Nevada \u2014 or a new role at the firm a few weeks prior to the internal announcement.\nFlagg\u2019s original lawsuit from last July accused an unknown person or persons behind an email account registered with encryption services provider Proton of allegedly \u201caccessing private and confidential information\u201d stored on his computer network or system. That included emails between Flagg and his attorney and \u201cother private and confidential information,\u201d the suit alleges.\nFlagg is suing for invasion of privacy and violating the state\u2019s Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act. The agent requested a trial to determine damages.\nFlagg didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment and his assistant deferred any comment to his attorney Martin Singer of Lavely &amp; Singer, who was traveling Monday and unable to respond to a request for comment by press time.\nA spokesperson for Kotler cited the pending litigation as the reason for declining to comment.\nNo answer to the complaint has yet been submitted to the court by a defendant. It\u2019s unclear if additional defendants will be named as the original lawsuit was against \u201cDoes 1-10.\u201d\n\nElliman declined to comment. Compass declined comment through a spokesperson, who referenced the company\u2019s policy on pending litigation.\nLast week, a judge continued a status update meeting in Flagg\u2019s lawsuit to Aug. 14.\nThe naming of Kotler as a defendant comes after Flagg\u2019s attorney asked a judge in September for permission to conduct third-party discovery with Kotler; Jonathan Butler, Elliman vice president and broker of record for California; Flagg\u2019s former assistant Michelle Carlson; and Douglas Elliman\u2019s California subsidiary.\nButler and Carlson did not respond to a request for comment Monday.\nAmong the records requested from Kotler were any documents related to the Proton email account and all communications between anyone at Douglas Elliman of California and\nTRD\ninvolving Flagg starting from May 1, 2024, according to court documents.\nFlagg parted ways with Elliman last March. A\nreport\nthat ran last May from\nTRD\n, pointed to Flagg\u2019s exit from Elliman occurring alongside a settlement related to a Pasadena home sale where Flagg represented the seller and the buyer. The sellers in that deal allegedly had concerns about whether all offers had been presented,\nTRD\nreported last year.\nThe agent and the brokerage disagreed on the reason for Flagg\u2019s contract being terminated, according to the report. Singer told\nTRD\nat the time that Compass reached out to Flagg about joining the firm \u201clong before any dispute existed between Josh Flagg and Douglas Elliman.\u201d\nTo reach the reporter,\nclick here\n.\n",

        "content": "A food and beverage tech firm is leaving a Loop office building that was recently bought out of distress for an updated building on Wacker Drive.\nJBT Marel leased more than 27,000 square feet on the 34th floor of Beacon Capital Partners\u2019 333 West Wacker Drive, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe relocation, slated for later this year, comes as its lease for roughly 24,000 square feet at Namdar Realty Group and Mason Asset Management\u2019s 70 West Madison Street winds down. It\u2019s been based there since 2010 under its pre-merger identity, John Bean Technologies.\nThe upgrade highlights the flight-to-quality trend among office tenants leaving older buildings for newly renovated spaces that offer more amenities.\nBoston-based Beacon Capital Partners made one of the biggest downtown office trades in years when it\nbought the 36-story Wacker Drive tower\nin April last year for $125 million, or $141 per square foot. The firm has since been repositioning the 888,000-square-foot building with a refreshed lobby and tenant lounge on the top floor.\nThose investments proved a key draw for JBT Marel. The tenant sought a more modern environment to reflect its larger global footprint after its January merger with Icelandic processing firm Marel, which pushed combined revenue past $3.5 billion.\n\nThe layout will favor open, collaborative areas meant to foster more group work among the firm\u2019s 50-plus Chicago-area employees and international visitors, Vice President Jeff Scipta said.\nThe company is keeping a hybrid schedule, with local employees required to come in just two days a week. But Scipta and other executives said the Chicago office is poised to become a hub for broader gatherings across its 12,200-person global workforce.\nThe Wacker Drive building was 81 percent leased before the deal, according to CoStar. Another recent win for Beacon includes a 20,000-square-foot lease with financial services firm Briar Hall, as well as a 50,000-square-foot,\nfull-floor lease at 231 South LaSalle Street\nby the Office of the Inspector General. Both leases were signed in May.\nMeanwhile, JBT Marel\u2019s departure adds to the challenges at 70 West Madison Street.\nThe building, recently acquired by Namdar Realty Group and Mason Asset Management for $85 million ($60 per square foot)\nin a distressed sale\nin January, is facing rising vacancy. One of its largest tenants, Arnold &amp; Porter Kaye Scholer, is\nalso exiting the building\nfor offices at Irvine Company\u2019s 300 North LaSalle.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Jerry Karlik is joining Chicago\u2019s mix of office-to-residential developments.\nHis firm, Port Washington, New York-based developer JK Equities, is planning to convert the offices at 1006 South Michigan Avenue, also known as the Graphic Arts Building, into 49 loft-style apartments. Ten of the apartments will be set aside as affordable.The developer\u2019s plans were approved by the Chicago Plan Commission earlier this month and construction is expected to begin in early 2026.\nOffice-to-residential conversions have been propped up as key catalysts for reviving downtown areas struggling to regain vibrancy since the pandemic. Yet they\u2019ve\nproven perilous\nfor some developers who\u2019ve attempted them, as well, including a Chicago project at\n65 East Wacker Place\nthat is now being led by\nAdam Friedberg\u2019s Mavrek\nafter going through a lender\u2019s seizure under a previous owner.\nJK Equities\u2019 project joins the pipeline as other office-to-residential developments gain steam around Chicago.\nThe European liquor mogul\nCampari family alongside Chicago-based developer R2\nare deploying $64 million to turn half of the 14 floors at 79 West Monroe Street into 117 apartments. About 30 percent of them will be designated for households making an average of 60 percent of the area\u2019s median income in exchange for $28 million in tax increment financing from the city for the project.\nIt is the first of several conversions to be subsidized under a city program known as\nLaSalle Street Reimagined\n. In exchange for city funding support, the developers agree to meet a higher-than-usual threshold of affordable housing within the residential conversion project \u2014 usually about 30 percent of the resulting units for the LaSalle Street program.\n\nThe city has approved four other projects through the program, four of which have not broken ground but are in various stages of pre-construction.\nThe JK Equities development is not part of the La Salle Street program, proving developers have an appetite for such projects even without city funding. The conversion of the 8-story, 130,000 square foot building is expected to cost $14.5 million. It will be located next to a 73-story luxury apartment tower at 1000 South Michigan designed by Helmut Jahn that the firm recently completed.\nRepresentatives of JK Equities declined to comment.\nWhile conversions have made popular discussion points for revamping outdated offices, they have been difficult to execute. At 65 East Wacker, for instance, developer Chase Chavin\u2019s firm Intersection handed the keys of the 24-story office at 65 East Wacker Place to lender Acres Capital. Intersection had purchased the building for $19 million in 2022 after the previous owner defaulted on its Acres mortgage and planned to convert a portion of the 96-year-old building into 144 apartments.\n",

Work on the multifamily building and event center is slated to begin in April.\nThe commission asked Wilks to revise the site plan earlier this year. The approval clears the way for one of North Texas\u2019 most ambitious developments to go vertical after the commission approved two site plans in October and\nanother two in February\n.\nPlans for the full buildout call for 3 million square feet of offices, 400,000 square feet of retail and entertainment, 1,200 hotel rooms, 230 townhomes and nearly 2,000 mid- and high-rise residential units.\nThe first phase is scheduled for delivery by 2027 and includes the multifamily units, hotel, 120,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space and a 25,000-square-foot amphitheater.\n\nThe apartment project, dubbed The Noc, is budgeted at $46.3 million, or $248,000 per unit, while the Cana Chapel is expected to cost $1.2 million, or $250 per square foot, according to state filings. Two more phases are planned over the next decade.\nWilks purchased the land in 2015, when the project was known as Frisco North. Since then, it\u2019s brought on a high-powered team including Kimley-Horn, Sasaki, BOKA Powell, Hord Coplan Macht, UNStudio and Michael Hsu Office of Architecture.\nFirefly Park is part of a wave of development transforming Frisco into a North Texas powerhouse. Work recently began on JVP Management\u2019s $3 billion mixed-use project known as The Mix and on the $2 billion Fields West development by Karahan Companies.\nMeanwhile, Toyota Stadium, home of FC Dallas, is undergoing a $182 million renovation ahead of the 2026 World Cup, while Jerry Jones\u2019 Blue Star Land is adding office, residential and hotel towers at The Star in Frisco, the headquarters of the Dallas Cowboys.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "One of Douglas Elliman\u2019s top agents in New York City has left the firm after more than two decades.\nJessica Cohen has moved to Brown Harris Stevens to form a new team, the brokerage announced. Joining her from Elliman are Joseph Polivy and Elia Clemente, who will serve on Cohen\u2019s team alongside BHS\u2019 Tara Osbourne.\nThe cohort will work from BHS\u2019 office on the Upper West Side.\n\u201cIn my introduction to Bess and the managers at the company, there was so much personal and professional history that connected me,\u201d Cohen wrote in a statement. \u201cThey were so thoughtful and caring in the way they approached me.\u201d\nWhile at Elliman, Cohen consistently landed among the top 3 percent of the company\u2019s brokers nationwide, earning her the Pinnacle designation announced at the firm\u2019s annual Ellie awards. Last year, Cohen also took home a lifetime achievement award from Elliman.\nCohen\u2019s team, then a six-person cohort, closed roughly $33 million in sales in 2023, according to the latest numbers available from RealTrends.\nNow under the BHS banner, Cohen is planning to launch 10 listings later this week, according to a spokesperson for the firm. Earlier this year, Cohen brought the buyer of a $7 million penthouse at 104 Charlton. She also represented the buyer in the sale of Unit 45B at Central Park Tower, which closed for $12 million in November.\n\u201cJessica\u2019s reputation and consistent success speak for themselves,\u201d BHS CEO Bess Freedman wrote in a statement.\n\nA spokesperson for Elliman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCohen was initially cast in Bravo\u2019s \u201cMillion Dollar Listing New York\u201d alongside celebrity brokers such as Ryan Serhant and Fredrik Eklund, but\nshe was fired\nafter three months of filming. Cohen chalked the network\u2019s decision up to her not being \u201cinteresting enough,\u201d she told\nThe Real Deal\nin 2013.\nCohen\u2019s departure comes after other veteran agents have exited Elliman for other firms. Just last week,\nDennis Mangone\n, known for his work with developers like hotelier Ian Schrager, jumped from Elliman to Compass. Lisa Simonsen, also at Elliman for nearly 20 years, joined Brown Harris Stevens last fall.\nDepartures from the firm picked up last year after a period of mounting losses and significant executive shakeups at Elliman. The company announced in October the\nabrupt retirement\nof its longtime CEO and chairman, Howard Lorber. Days later, the firm\nfired the CEO\nof its brokerage segment, Scott Durkin.\nLorber\u2019s retirement came at the behest of Elliman\u2019s board of directors, which had ordered an internal investigation into the company\u2019s culture after sexual assault allegations surfaced against two of its former top brokers, Tal and Oren Alexander, and their brother Alon. During the probe, Lorber admitted to\nhaving intimate relationships\nwith agents at the firm, including Cohen.\nCohen accused Tal and Oren of drugging her in an account she provided to the New York Times, where she described waking up in the hospital following a 2010 party attended by the three brothers. She recounted the allegation to then-Elliman executive Dottie Herman in the days after the party and to Lorber in 2012.\nA spokesperson for Elliman said in response to the Times report that an agent had told a senior executive that she\u2019d blacked out at a party, but the information was shared confidentially and no formal complaint was ever made.\n",

        "content": "Spoiler alert: This state budget is not going to have a whole lot of housing-related items.\nIn January, Gov. Kathy Hochul unveiled her\nexecutive budget\n, which focused a great deal on cracking down on institutional investors but not much on spurring new housing construction.\nThe state Senate and Assembly were aligned with the governor on wanting to curb the ability of such investors to scoop up single- and two-family homes, so it seems likely that some version of these proposals will make it into the final budget. Of course, it is\nless clear\nwhen the budget will be finalized.\nThe budget is expected to include $1 billion to help build housing in NYC over the next five years, as part of the commitments made for the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity. The effectiveness of that funding will depend on whether other sources of financing keep up. In a report released last week, the New York Housing Conference argued that projected drops in the city\u2019s capital plan over the next 10 years will mean the state funding will be used to \u201cplug budget holes rather than support additional needs.\u201d\nMeanwhile, both a bill aimed at making it easier for religious organizations to build affordable housing on their property and efforts to create a state-based housing voucher program don\u2019t seem to have enough momentum to be included in this year\u2019s budget. I\u2019m hearing that some are hopeful that a\nmeasure\nto change apartment-to-condo conversion rules for certain buildings will be included in the final budget.\nLast year\u2019s state budget included a ton of housing-related items, including 485x, good cause eviction, a tax break for office-to-residential conversions and a provision to lift the city\u2019s floor area ratio cap on residential density. All signs point to this year being less substantive than that.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nThe city will start enforcing composting rules on Tuesday. If you are an owner or property manager, how are you working to comply with the rules? Are you able to? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: This year marks the 50th anniversary of a state Supreme Court decision that found New York\u2019s old property tax system to be unconstitutional,\na new report\nby the Community Service Society and the Progress &amp; Poverty Institute points out. The replacement scheme has \u201caged poorly,\u201d\nthe report states\n.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\n\u2014 An attorney for Mayor Eric Adams is urging a federal judge to decide this week whether to drop the federal corruption charges against the mayor,\nGothamist reports\n. Attorney Alex Spiro pointed to the Thursday deadline for petitions for his candidacy for mayor. \u201cNow, with the petition-filing deadline just days away, we respectfully urge the court to issue its decision as soon as practicable,\u201d Spiro wrote.\n\u2014 The New York Working Families Party on Saturday endorsed City Comptroller Brad Lander, City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, state Sen. Zellnor Myrie and Assembly member Zohran Mamdani for mayor,\nCity &amp; State reports\n. The organization will eventually choose which of those candidates to rank first.\n\u2014 A state Judge has temporarily halted a new law that limits the outside income of state lawmakers to $35,000 a year,\nthe Times Union reports\n. The law, which was supposed to go into effect earlier this year, is on ice as an appeal to a decision that found the law to be constitutional makes its way through the courts. State Republicans filed a lawsuit challenging the law last year.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Monday was\n$7 million\nat 10 Pineapple Street. The Brooklyn Heights townhouse is 4,000 square feet and four stories.\nThe Corcoran Group\u2019s\nKaren Talbott, Kyle Talbott and Scott Sternberg have the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$3.6 million\nfor an apartment building at 152 Sherman Avenue. The Inwood complex is 23,700 square feet and has 41 units.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $12 million for a condo unit at 111 Murray Street. The Tribeca condo is 3,300 square feet and last sold on the market in 2019 for $12.2 million.\nCompass\u2019\nIan Slater, Michael Koeneke and Eduardo Martinez have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 269,581-square-foot, 33-story building at 185 East 80th Street in Manhattan. The owner of the proposed building is Skyline Developers with David West of Hill West Architects as the applicant of record.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

This also included rent-controlled units which can\u2019t legally be used as short-term rentals in the city.\nDefendants allegedly jacked up rent for some of their properties up to 113 percent higher than before the January wildfires, according to the lawsuit. They also allegedly used deceptive tactics, such as fake IDs and falsely advertised properties outside of Los Angeles.\nAfter the\nPalisades\nand\nEaton\nfires broke out on Jan. 7, the defendants allegedly expanded their illegal operation, offering and booking long-term rentals in violation of the anti price-gouging law, including for some of those same properties, according to the lawsuit.\nCalifornia lawmakers approved the anti-gouging law following the Northridge Earthquake in 1994.\nIn response to the wildfires, Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency, triggering the law in the L.A. region. It is illegal to increase the price of essential food and housing by more than 10 percent while the declaration is still enacted.\nAfter the fires, landlords in the Los Angeles market illegally gouged renters, with\noverall rents rising by 20 percent\nacross Los Angeles County,\naccording to a Washington Post\nanalysis.\nIn nearly 30 cities and Los Angeles neighborhoods, the median rent for homes listed within two weeks after the fires started spiked well\npast the legal limit of 10 percent\n, compared with those listed within two weeks before the blazes that burned from Altadena to Pacific Palisades.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "Many homeowners who lost historic homes in the Los Angeles County wildfires are looking to quickly replace them with manufactured homes.\nSurvivors from the Eaton and Palisades fires are eying modular or prefabricated construction for their replacement homes,\nthe Los Angeles Times reported\n.\nThe off-the-shelf housing is simpler to manage, faster to build, and cheaper than designing a custom home. But there\u2019s a catch.\nFor years, modular companies have promised to revolutionize the homebuilding industry \u2014 only to fail spectacularly. Or wade through technological problems. Or face skepticism about limited designs and quality, according to the Times.\nThose unconvinced by modular construction fear that fire victims may turn to a lesser and riskier product because they\u2019re overwhelmed by the alternatives.\n\u201cYou have 8,000 residents, some of whom have never had to change a tire, all of a sudden thrown into this,\u201d Freddy Sayegh, an Altadena resident whose family lost homes in the Eaton fire and leads an advocacy group for survivors, told the Times. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they want a modular home.\n\u201cThey want easy home building.\u201d\nModular housing might work for some people, she said, but too many modular homes would erase\nAltadena\u2019s rich architectural past\n.\nMass-produced housing benefits in cost and speed, especially after disasters.\nCommunity groups, architects and builders are trying to jointly buy materials and\ndevelop shared designs for new houses\n, including ones that fire survivors could select from a brochure, similar to the century-old Sears catalogs.\nBut unlike builders eyeing blocks of tract homes on undeveloped land, property owners in the fire zones have set desires and circumstances. Different insurance payouts and design preferences make it harder to act collectively, according to the Times.\n\nModular construction could be an answer, for some. Companies can build a house in a factory, truck it to a site, crane it onto a property and then bolt it to a foundation. Done.\nCover makes parts for its homes in an 80,000-square-foot factory, then snaps them together on site, \u201clike Legos,\u201d said Alexis Rivas, co-founder and CEO of the Gardena-based firm, who has spoken with 300 fire-affected homeowners.\nModular construction, however, has had manufacturing and completion issues.\nKaterra, a startup based in Menlo Park, drew nearly $3 billion from investors before\ndeclaring bankruptcy in 2021\n, six years after it was founded. Modular startup Veev, based in Hayward with ties to Israel, shut down after raising\n$600 million\n.\nA\n2022 report\nfrom UC Berkeley\u2019s Terner Center for Housing Innovation found few low-income housing developments in Southern California had tried modular construction. The first project experienced delays and cost increases because of inexperience and unclear division of work between the manufacturer and general contractor.\nLast month, Steadfast LA, a wildfire recovery nonprofit founded by developer and former mayoral candidate Rick Caruso, announced it would provide as many as\n100 free modular homes\nto L.A. fire victims.\nThe two-bedroom homes, built by Redwood City-based Samara, will go to residents of low to moderate incomes who are uninsured, underinsured or elderly and otherwise lack the money to rebuild on their land.\nThe 950-square-foot homes cost about $500,000, including site preparation and permitting, Mike McNamara, CEO of Samara, told the Times. He pointed to their fire-safe design, such as metal roofs and double-pane windows.\n\u201cIt\u2019s brand new, all-modern materials,\u201d McNamara said. \u201cEverything about it is probably significantly superior to what burnt down.\u201d\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

But mere hours later, HomeServices CEO Gino Blefari\ndenied the report in a memo\nto employees, saying \u201cthere are no discussions, negotiations, or agreements\u201d to sell BHHS or any of its affiliated companies.\nTop broker Mario Greco, who left BHHS Chicago for Compass last year, said he got \u201clike 1,000 calls\u201d from old friends at BHHS, and when he came into his office at Compass afterward, \u201ceveryone was whispering about it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sign of where the real estate industry is going, consolidation and market share accumulation. That\u2019s what this is a play for, if, in fact, it\u2019s happening,\u201d Greco said. \u201cThe writing\u2019s on the wall, just because of the exodus of agents even after me, and the general feel of the market in Chicago is that Berkshire Hathaway has seen better days.\u201d\nGreco\u2019s MG Group, which brought in $100.8 million in sales volume across 162 transactions while working with BHHS in 2023,\nleft the firm for Compass\nin March last year.\nA year later, BHHS Chicago\u2019s president of brokerage at the time, Mark Pasquesi\nalso left the brokerage\nto lead Jameson Sotheby\u2019s new team on Chicago\u2019s affluent North Shore. Greco built a massive business over two decades with BHHS to become\none of the city\u2019s top agents\nand Pasquesi was with the firm for 11 years and rose from broker to brokerage president. They were the latest in a string of losses of executives and dealmaking talent for BHHS.\nBHHS hasn\u2019t kept up with new norms of aggressive recruitment, which weakened its hold on the Chicago market at a time when larger brokerages \u2014 like Compass with its massive acquisition of @properties \u2014 are focused on market share accumulation and faring particularly well, top Chicago broker Jeff Lowe, who previously affiliated with BHHS, said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that Berkshire Hathaway in Chicago has had major struggles in the last few years. Their market shares plummeted,\u201d Lowe said.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether a deal between Compass and BHHS will surface. BHHS has all the financial backing it needs as the real estate arm of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett\u2019s trillion-dollar conglomerate. But it could also be viewed as an asset to offload by the famously shrewd billionaire, Lowe said.\nIn 2021, two BHHS Chicago offices ranked among the top 20 brokerage offices in the Chicago area, with its Lincoln Park office coming in at No. 12 and its downtown office pulling in about $1.14 billion in total deal volume over the year at No. 8,\naccording to Midwest Real Estate Data figures provided to Chicago Agent Magazine\n.\nLast year,\nonly the downtown office made the list and it had fallen to No. 16 with just over $570 million in total deal volume year to date.\nFurthermore, in 2020, BHHS had two agents in\nthe top Chicagoland agents ranking\nyear to date (Greco and Sophia Klopas). Last year, it had zero.\nThe firm still has a strong presence in other markets, though, so Lowe said the rumors of a deal came as a shock to him.\nBHHS is the fourth-largest brokerage in the country, with the top four companies together holding 20 percent market share nationally, according to RealTrends. The firm had 820 brokerage offices and 270 franchises nationwide as of the end of 2024.\nBHHS Chicago CEO Diane Glass rejected the idea that the local branch is struggling, saying the company has changed in the \u201cbest possible ways\u201d and is \u201cas vibrant as ever.\u201d The firm employs more than 1,300 real estate professionals through its offices in the Chicagoland area.\n\n\u201cWe are more grounded in the work we do, more connected to each other and more confident about making a difference for our clients,\u201d Glass said.\nBHHS Chicago started losing big names when Compass came to the city in 2017, with Lowe moving his team over to help Compass launch its first local office that fall. The Lowe Group reported $247.6 million in volume across 211 deals closed from July 2023 to July 2024, according to\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nmost recent ranking of Chicago\u2019s top brokers.\n\u201cA big chunk of the first people at Compass were from Berkshire Hathaway,\u201d Lowe said. Among them was Eudice Fogel of Fogel Slate Group and Joanne Nemerovski, who narrowly missed making\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nlist of\nthe city\u2019s top 20 brokers last year\nwith $69.4 million in volume.\nLauren Mitrick Wood is another founding member of Compass that came from BHHS Chicago. She, too, came just shy of the city\u2019s top 20 agents with $73.4 million in sales.\nOthers have followed since then, and BHHS has struggled to compete when it comes to recruiting agents, Lowe said. HomeServices CEO Blefari, himself, once said Compass was\nnot competing on a \u201clevel playing field\u201d\nin offering investor-fueled bonuses and lucrative splits.\nCompass, @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate \u2013 which Compass acquired this year \u2013 and Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Real Estate have gotten increasingly aggressive with recruitment efforts, Lowe said, which can pose a challenge for firms that don\u2019t use the same strategy.\nGlass is confident in BHHS Chicago\u2019s less aggressive manner of recruiting and retaining agents.\n\u201cWe have the right people with us today and we are attracting like-minded agents and teams,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are growing our most talented people into new and bigger roles, empowering them to put fresh ideas into action.\u201d\nBut BHHS Chicago\u2019s personnel losses are adding up. In February of 2023,\nCompass poached Brian Pistorius\nalong with Amy Ruch and Jenna Cody, a team that brought in $50 million in deals over two years. Pistorius was preceded by Meredith Pierson, who left BHHS to form a new Glenview-based team with Compass\u2019 Missy Jerfita.\nThen came Greco and, earlier this month, Pasquesi, who declined to comment on the recent rumors.\nIf Compass does end up acquiring BHHS, the nation\u2019s largest real estate brokerage is unlikely to get in any significant antitrust trouble given President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cpro-business\u201d stance, which includes executive purges at the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice, Greco said. And if they are in talks about a deal, the two companies have likely already vetted the chances of this, he said.\nWhen asked about the Wall Street Journal\u2019s report of a potential deal, a spokesperson for Compass said, \u201cwe don\u2019t comment on market rumors or speculation.\u201d\nHomeServices of America Executive Vice President Chris Kelly doubled down on denying the existence of a deal in a new statement.\n\u201cThere is no pending or contemplated transaction or sale between HomeServices of America and Compass or any other party,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWe are fully committed to our companies, agents, employees and mortgage, title and insurance professionals, helping to empower the incredible work they do for buyers, sellers and their communities.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The rising costs of homeownership across the Bay Area has impacted the financial equation for whether to rent or buy a home \u2014 with most homeowners now breaking even after 30 years.\nA 2024 analysis showed that San Francisco had a 20-year break-even point for homeownership, while San Jose, Fremont, and Oakland had shorter timeframes, the San Francisco Chronicle reported, citing a rent-versus-buy calculator using NerdWallet.\nBut updated calculations for this year reveal that for all these cities, the break-even point now exceeds 30 years \u2014 the maximum tracked by the calculator. Essentially, homeownership only becomes more cost-effective after paying off a 30-year mortgage.\nThis shift aligns with previous analyses indicating the Bay Area has one of the nation\u2019s highest price-to-rent ratios.\nSurprisingly, mortgage rates remain nearly unchanged from last year, and home values haven\u2019t seen drastic changes \u2014 though Oakland had a 4.7 percent drop. Rent prices have also remained stable in Oakland and Fremont, while increasing in San Francisco and San Jose.\nNerdWallet attributes this change to adjustments in its calculator, which now better reflects today\u2019s evolving market. While rental costs remained relatively static, numerous homeownership-related costs were revised upward, collectively making buying significantly more expensive.\n\nThe key factors driving the shift:\n1) Home value and rent growth: Home appreciation rates were adjusted to 4.5 percent, with Bay Area values historically rising closer to 5 percent, according to the Chronicle. The California Association of Realtors predicts a 4.6 percent statewide price increase this year. Meanwhile, rental growth varies \u2014 San Francisco had a 5 percent increase, attributed to population growth and return-to-office trends.\n2) Inflation and maintenance costs: Inflation assumptions increased from 2 percent to 3 percent, reflecting recent trends. Additionally, maintenance cost estimates tripled to 1.5 percent of a home\u2019s value per year, factoring in rising building material costs due to tariffs, according to the newspaper.\n3) Home insurance: California\u2019s insurance crisis is pushing premiums higher. While calculators estimate insurance as a percentage of home value, real premiums are based on coverage and rebuilding costs, leading to significant regional disparities.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "The City of Menlo Park and local housing advocates want to plant 483 affordable homes on three public parking lots in its downtown \u2014 but businesses of the pricey city are pushing back.\nSave Downtown Menlo Park, a pro-business group, has collected at least 3,500 signatures and raised $138,000 in legal fees to block the project, according to its\nwebsite\nand the\nSan Jose Mercury News\n. More than 115 businesses signed an online plea to the city.\nThe businesses say they\u2019ll lose money if their customers have no place to park.\nKevin Cunningham, a property owner and lead organizer, said the city\u2019s decision has worsened frustrations among downtown businesses. He suggested other places to build homes, such as in the Civic Center, two blocks away, that wouldn\u2019t hamper downtown parking.\n\u201cOne business owner said that [the parking lot issue] is not the sole reason he\u2019s leaving, but he\u2019s had a lot of frustrations with the city lately,\u201d Cunningham told the Mercury News. \u201cHe said he didn\u2019t even want to see how this plays out and is just so frustrated with doing business downtown that the decision to pursue these lots was the tipping point.\u201d\nThe city, home to such tech firms as Meta, parent company of Facebook, has some of the highest housing costs in the U.S., with a typical home priced at $2.6 million, and where rents\nrose nearly 35 percent\nlast year. About 420,000 people who can live cheaper elsewhere commute into San Mateo County for work.\nTo compel Menlo Park to build more affordable housing, the state has required the city plan to build nearly 3,000 homes by 2031.\nEnter the city-owned parking lots used by patrons of the shops and restaurants in its downtown, on Oak Grove Avenue between University Drive and El Camino Real.\nA sign posted by Save Downtown Menlo Park said the city wants to replace them with 483 \u201clow-income housing units\u201d in buildings of up to 10 stories, displacing 556 parking spots, with no studies to measure the economic impacts to businesses, schools or infrastructure.\n\nThe city has given developers until today, March 31, to submit requests for qualifications to redevelop parking plazas 1, 2, and/or 3, according to assistant city manager Stephen Stolte. \u201cNo formal plans have been submitted,\u201d he told the Mercury News.\nA city staff report said Civic Center and other parks were excluded from housing development to preserve green space and community gathering areas.\nJordan Grimes, of Greenbelt Alliance, said 3,000 units in Menlo Park may be a \u201cdrop in the bucket,\u201d but are critical for addressing the housing shortage.\n\u201cMenlo Park has added tens of thousands of jobs over the last decade, since Facebook took root in the city, and has added very few new homes,\u201d Grimes told the Mercury News. \u201cSo it has created this really extreme shortage.\u201d\nAdvocates for unpaving the public parking lots for homes said the city needs to build housing across the city, not just shove it into Belle Haven, a historically underserved neighborhood next to East Palo Alto.\nJenny Michel, a property manager at Cushman &amp; Wakefield and an affordable housing advocate, emphasized the importance of a downtown location for workers who commute from as far as El Dorado County, three hours each way.\nShe said Menlo Park businesses and their customers will adjust, citing the example of parking garages used on California Avenue in downtown Palo Alto. It\u2019s not clear what parking garages would replace the downtown parking lots.\n\u201cThere will be parking. It\u2019ll be a phased approach,\u201d Michel said. \u201cPeople may need to walk a block for a couple of months, but that\u2019s OK. If they really like shopping at your store, they\u2019ll still shop there.\u201d\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

He could not be reached for comment by LIBN. He is set to be arraigned on Apr. 11.\nLegal issues have piled up against DeRosa. At least a half-dozen lawsuits have been filed by business partners and lenders in the last year, claiming he defaulted on payment obligations.\nThe developer\u2019s financial issues emerged publicly in the fall, when RiverheadLocal.com reported the pause in work on a project in the town.\n\nLast week, an investor in two G2D projects won a $5.42 million default judgment in a case alleging fraud in the purchase and eventual mortgage default of a Huntington office building, according to court records. The investor alleged DeRosa and his wife diverted funds for \u201cpersonal residences, luxury goods, vehicles, yachts, and other self-serving investments.\u201d\nDeRosa formerly served as a principal of Roanoke Sand &amp; Gravel, which supplied the sand used for the concrete in the Freedom Tower in Lower Manhattan.\nG2D developments include a 12-unit redevelopment of a former industrial building in Huntington, an 18-unit mixed-use redevelopment of an office building in Hicksville and the $24 million Gateway Plaza project in Huntington Station, which encompassed 64 rental apartments atop 14,000 square feet of retail and office space.\nG2D also built a $15 million project with 36 apartments in Riverhead before abandoning work on a $22 million project on Osborn Avenue in the same town.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "After\nfinishing last year\non a high note, the Manhattan office market came out the gate even hotter in 2025.\nOffice leasing volume reached 12.2 million square feet in the first quarter, the most since the fourth quarter of 2019, when the borough logged 12.7 million square feet, according to a new report from Savills. The leasing boom comes as work-in-office rates reach 76 percent of pre-pandemic levels, with one in four employers planning to further increase office attendance, according to The Partnership for New York City.\n\u201cManhattan, in general, is in a class of its own right now as far as major U.S. office markets,\u201d said Savills\u2019 Matthew Schreck, a co-author of the report. \u201cWe\u2019ve had three to four straight quarters of continually accelerating demand. The reason is due in part to the tenant mix that exists in this market\u2026 and their attitude towards work on-site.\u201d\nThe market was boosted by a wave of large leases, including 16 deals for 100,000 square feet or more.\nThe largest lease of the quarter, according to Savills, was Jane Street Capital\u2019s\n400,000-square-foot expansion\nat Brookfield\u2019s 250 Vesey Street, which increased the firm\u2019s footprint to nearly 1 million square feet. Eight of the ten largest leases were renewals, some including expansion components.\nThe second-largest lease was Universal Music Group, which inked a\n334,000-square-foot lease\nto relocate to Vornado\u2019s Penn 2 office tower. Law firm Mayer Brown\u2019s 331,000-square-foot expansion at Rockefeller Group\u2019s 1221 Sixth Avenue came in third.\nAvailability continued to tighten, especially in Class A buildings. The overall availability rate was 17.7 percent, down from 20 percent a year ago. Availability at the highest-end buildings, classified as trophy and Class A+, dipped below 12 percent across Manhattan and fell to 7.5 percent in Midtown.\n\n\u201cYou can see the run on this type of space, and the construction pipeline is limited,\u201d Schreck said. \u201cThere are a few projects due to be completed either this year or next and then there\u2019s a bit of a gap\u2026. In that interim basis, there is going to be a supply side pinch.\u201d\nThe center of Manhattan was in especially high demand, seeing lower availability rates than the overall 17.7 percent average. Hudson Yards\u2019 availability was 9%, Union Square\u2019s was 11.2 percent while Grand Central\u2019s vacancy rate was 13.9 percent.\nWhile overall asking rent, which includes direct and sublet space, is down 2.1 percent year over year, class A rents ticked slightly higher with an increase of 0.5 percent. Values surged in prime office corridors. The average asking rent for upper floors in trophy buildings in Hudson Yards and the Plaza District hit nearly $160 per square foot; a few deals fetched $200 per square foot and up.\n\u201cThe types of companies that are leasing those types of spaces are a lot of financial services firms, especially private equity and hedge funds, large law firms and large multinational-type companies,\u201d Schreck said.\nThe real estate, financial services and law sectors are leading the return-to-office push, according to The Partnership for New York City, which surveyed more than 125 employers on office attendance. As of mid-March, 57 percent of Manhattan office workers are in the office on a typical weekday, the study found.\nOffice attendance rates for real estate firms have reached 85 percent and 62 percent for financial services and law firms.\nWhile 75 percent of employers say their current policy is the \u201cnew normal,\u201d the remaining 25 percent plan to increase office attendance over the next 12 months, the study found.\n",

        "content": "At first, the Feil Organization didn\u2019t succeed in its Billionaires\u2019 Row conversion. It\u2019s ready to try, try again.\nFeil filed plans for a major alteration at 140 West 57th Street,\nits long-dormant property\nin Midtown West, PincusCo\nreported\n. The alteration application is in service of a conversion from a 14-story office property to a 47-unit residential building, maintaining the same height.\nThe Beaufort dates back to 1907, when it opened as a studio apartment building for artists; it received landmark designation at the turn of the century. But its future has been in question for years.\nFeil bought the building from Harry Macklowe in 2009 for $59 million, and in 2015, brought in Goldstein Hill &amp; West to study the feasibility of converting the property into residential use. That study revealed that about 11,000 square feet of residential space could be added on top of the building, according to Feil, for a total of roughly 80,000 square feet. The property could then be converted into 20 residential units with a duplex apartment on top.\nBy early 2016, Feil stopped renewing office leases and began clearing space for a conversion. It later learned, however, that a preexisting zoning lot development agreement limited the building\u2019s floor area. Despite the ZLDA being public record, Feil sued the project architect\nfor $12.6 million\n.\nIn 2018, Feil\nput the vacant office building on the market\n, pitching it as a potential residential conversion or boutique office renovation.\n\nBy 2020, Feil was back to the drawing board, this time with MdeAs Architects leading the design. A proposal at the time called for the renovation of the property, seemingly keeping it as office space, according to\nYIMBY\n.\nAn architect with MdeAs is listed on the latest Department of Buildings job application. The initial project cost for the alteration is $17 million, though that\u2019s subject to change with subsequent applications.\nFeil did not immediately respond to a request for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nAt the start of the year, Feil was\nhit with a foreclosure lawsuit\nfiled by Wilmington Trust over contractors\u2019 unpaid mechanics liens placed on a struggling Loop office building at 10 South LaSalle Street in Chicago.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The year\u2019s biggest sale was Hines\u2019 $91 million acquisition of a 260,000-square-foot Extra Space Storage property in Cerritos, California.\nCerritos ranked second in total sales volume last year, while Miami ranked third.\n\nQueens isn\u2019t the only strong New York City performer in the sector. Brooklyn ranked fourth with $60.1 million in total sales last year. Manhattan was further down the list with $17 million in sales volume.\nPrime Group Holdings was the leading investor in the market last year, pouring $264 million into the sector. Carlyle Group ranked second with $178 million in acquisitions, followed by StrategicREIT\u2019s $131 million in deals.\nLast summer, Carlyle and Sabharwal Properties\nlanded a $100 million loan\nto refinance a four-property portfolio in New York City, comprising three self-storage properties in Brooklyn and one in Staten Island. A few months earlier, the private equity giant bought the Life Storage building at 87-16 121st Street in Queens from a joint venture of SNL Holdings and Equity Resource Investments\nfor $50.3 million\n.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The largest independent developer in the Pacific Northwest owns 31 office buildings, containing 4.9 million square feet.\nLast spring, the firm defaulted on the\n$239 million\nin CMBS loans tied to the seven buildings with 1.1 million square feet of offices. The landlord has been working with CW Capital, the special servicer, to modify and extend the loan.\nThe affected properties are Class A and B buildings between 16 and 55 years old and spread across downtown. Last spring, the seven buildings were 69 percent occupied, down from 92 percent in 2017, according to a special servicer\u2019s report.\nThe properties include 635 Elliott and 645 Elliott, both on the waterfront, in Elliott Park.\nThey also include Fifth &amp; Jackson, across the street from King Street Station; Fourth &amp; Blanchard in the Denny Regrade; and three in Lower Queen Anne, including 200 West Thomas and both towers of the West Harrison campus, according to the Business Journal.\n\nSelig needs a capital injection to fund leasing commissions and tenant improvements. But to attract that money, CW Capital would have to write off some of the debt \u2014 no easy task with higher interest rates and declining property values, according to the Business Journal.\nAnother $379 million in securities backed by nine older Seattle office buildings comes due this month.\nIn December, Martin Selig\ndefaulted on a $240 million loan\non two newer office buildings, with the firm indicating it may hand the keys to its lender, Acore Capital.\nThe combined debt adds up to $858 million, secured by office properties hammered by a pandemic shift to remote work, suppressing demand and driving values to historic lows.\nTo raise cash, Martin Selig\nlisted two development sites\nfor an undisclosed price at 400 Fourth Avenue W and 401-419 Queen Anne Avenue N, in Lower Queen Anne.\nMore recently,\nthe company agreed to turn over to a receiver seven Seattle parking lots\n, which it borrowed $50 million against from Goldman Sachs Bank, according to the Business Journal.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "DWS Group has listed a 315,000-square-foot office building in San Francisco\u2019s Financial District for around $95 million.\nThe German-based investor put the 24-story building up for sale at 505 Montgomery Street for around $300 per square foot,\nthe San Francisco Business Times reported\n, citing unidentified sources.\nThe listing by Eastdil Secured would put the building at around $94.5 million.\nDWS Group, based in Frankfurt, bought the office building in 2005 for $118.5 million, or $376 per square foot. There is no debt on the building, according to Colliers, which handles its leasing.\nSelling the building for a targeted $300 per square foot may depend on whether the landlord can coax its largest tenant, Latham &amp; Watkins, to extend its lease beyond 2028.\nThe Los Angeles-based law firm renewed its lease for 117,000 square feet in 2020,, according to Compstak.\nTalks between DWS and Latham over a possible extension of the lease there are ongoing, two unidentified sources told the newspaper.\nThe 330-foot-tall granite building, built in 1988, was designed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill to evoke the Art Deco skyscrapers of the 1930s. It opened with a 40-foot inflatable gorilla hanging off its spire.\n\nIn February, Colliers was marketing 126,600 square feet for lease, indicating a 60 percent occupancy. Tenants include Regus, a coworking firm that signed\nan eight-year lease for 30,000 square feet\nin 2021; law firm Clark Hill; wealth management firm Whittier Trust; and Atel Capital Group, a financial services firm.\nThe building\u2019s listing comes as investors have begun to tiptoe into San Francisco\u2019s office market, which cratered after a pandemic shift to remote work. Vacancy hovers at a stubborn 36.6 percent, according to CBRE.\nThis year, a slew of office properties\nhave traded hands\n, while more investors have struck deals on buildings that\nhave yet to close\n, according to the Business Journal.\nLast year, total office purchases in the city hit $916 million, according to CBRE. This year, office buys could exceed $1 billion. But leases are king.\nThough leasing demand has improved, investors can no longer count on a steady stream of leases to prop up the value of their office buildings like they could before 2020. Such leases determine a building\u2019s values \u2014 as ongoing talks between DWS and Latham suggest.\nThe average price per square foot of office investment purchases in San Francisco rose to $310 last year, according to CBRE, up from $253 in 2023. The value of individual properties remains heavily reliant on tenancy, occupancy, location and build out, according to the Business Times.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Greg Abbott directed the Texas Rangers to probe the North Texas mosque and affiliated entities for \u201cpotential criminal activities,\u201d marking the fifth investigation his administration has undertaken against the development in the last week, the Texas Tribune\nreported\n.\nThe governor\u2019s office accused the group of \u201cscheming to evade law enforcement scrutiny\u201d Monday but offered no details on what laws were broken.\nThe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality found Epic City and its affiliated entities failed to obtain required authorizations or permits needed for construction of the project, Abbott\nsaid on X Tuesday\n.\nEpic City has seven days to cease construction of the \u201cillegal project\u201d or \u201cface the full weight of the law,\u201d the post said.\nPlans for the Plano mosque\u2019s development call for a 1,000-plus home residential community in Josephine, about 40 miles northeast of Dallas. The proposed project includes single- and multi-family housing, a mosque, senior living, commercial spaces, a K-12 school, community college, sports facilities and an outreach center.\n\nThe probe follows previous claims from Abbott that\na dozen state agencies\nwere\ninvestigating the mosque\nand Epic City. The governor elaborated on the investigations Monday, saying the Texas Attorney General\u2019s office was probing for potential violations of consumer protection laws.\nThe Texas Workforce Commission is investigating alleged discrimination under the Texas Fair Housing Act, and the Texas State Securities Board is looking for potential financial misconduct; the Texas Funeral Service Commission sent a cease-and-desist, citing unauthorized funeral services, Abbott said.\nAbbott also previously mentioned\nlaws being debated in the Texas legislature\nmeant to prevent \u201cforeign adversaries\u201d from buying land in Texas, but the citizenship status of the project\u2019s backers has not been confirmed.\nThe state\u2019s aggressive scrutiny of Epic has raised alarm among civil rights advocates and community members, many of whom note the vague accusations come amid broader political rhetoric targeting Muslim communities.\nA Collin County Commissioners Court hearing is set to be held to discuss the project next week.\nEpic City representatives have not yet commented on the governor\u2019s latest offensive. If built, the development would be among the largest Islam-centered community proposals in Texas.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

He will also have two years of supervised release, be fined $100,000 as well as forced to forfeit another $57,000 he took in bribes.\nCordasco pleaded guilty in October to conspiring to solicit and receive bribes.\nAccording to the lawsuit, Cordasco and another former FDNY chief, Anthony Saccavino, raked in $190,000 with their bribery scheme. From 2021 to 2023, they used their posts at the top of the FDNY\u2019s Bureau of Fire Prevention to fast-track building inspections and reviews in exchange for cash.\nThey allegedly worked with a third individual, a retired firefighter who led an \u201cexpediting\u201d business. The two FDNY chiefs served as silent partners in the business, receiving 30 percent in kickbacks for the inspections they helped expedite.\n\nProsecutors found about 30 instances of fast-tracked inspections and reviews expedited by Cardasco and Saccavino. The scheme came to an end in early 2023 after a \u201cfalling out\u201d with the third co-conspirator, who allegedly failed to pay the other two outstanding bribes.\nFollowing the sentencing, the attorney representing Cardasco referred to it as a \u201csad and troubling day,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s on his way home.\u201d\nBoth initially pleaded not guilty to the charges they faced. Saccavino switched to a guilty plea in January on charges of conspiracy to solicit and receive a bribe; he will be sentenced next month.\n\u201cEvery member of the FDNY takes a sworn oath to conduct themselves honestly and ethically,\u201d Fire Commissioner Robert Tucker said in a statement last month. \u201cAnything less will not be tolerated.

It is an EB-5 project, which means that foreign investors can invest $800,000 in the project in exchange for citizenship.\nToussaint Ateliers Residences LLC assembled the majority of a city block in 2023 for $6.1 million, records show. It\u2019s just outside of Miami\u2019s Little Haiti neighborhood and west of Morningside.\nEven larger projects have been proposed in the area.\nMiami Jewish Health\nis working with senior living provider Greystone Communities on a 192-unit independent senior living complex at its existing campus in Buena Vista. The project, called FiftyTwoNorth, will consist of a pair of five-story buildings and an 11-story building at 5200 Northeast Second Avenue. Construction is expected to start in 2027 and be completed in 2028.\nIn Little Haiti, SPV Realty, tied to New Yorker Justin Podolsky, has proposed a controversial redevelopment of the Design Place apartment complex. If approved,\nSabal Palm Village at Flagler Trail\nwould consist of roughly 3,000 apartments, 400 hotel rooms, offices, commercial, educational and civic space across 15 buildings. The 22.5-acre property is at the southwest corner of Northeast 54th Street and the Florida East Coast Railway tracks.\n",

        "content": "Two high-profile Fort Worth developments are heading for vertical construction, but not without months of delays blamed on issues with city incentives and public infrastructure work.\nNebraska-based Goldenrod Companies said it will start construction on the Van Zandt at the end of May, followed by One University in August, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe\nmixed-use projects\nrepresent a $400 million investment in Fort Worth\u2019s Cultural District.\nConstruction was delayed after the company had to revise its economic development agreement with the city and work with public works officials to push back road infrastructure timelines, Goldenrod Managing Principal Zach Wiegert said. A water retention tank also arrived later than expected.\nIt set Goldenrod behind a few months, Wiegert said.\nThe Van Zandt, at 2816 West Seventh Street, will include 226 apartments, 100,000 square feet of office space and 13,000 square feet of retail.\n\nOne University, to be built at 3001 Morton Street, is set to deliver 242 apartments, 115,000 square feet of office space and a 176-key Autograph Collection hotel called The Tycoon. The sites have already been cleared.\nThe developments operate under separate incentive agreements approved by the Fort Worth City Council in August 2023. If Goldenrod meets certain targets, the city could award up to $11.2 million for the Van Zandt and $19.7 million for One University. The firm must secure a certificate of occupancy for the Van Zandt by the end of 2026 and for One University by the end of 2027.\nLeasing efforts are underway, with JLL\u2019s Geoff Shelton marketing the office space. Local and out-of-town tenants, particularly in finance and oil and gas, have shown strong interest, he said. Leases could be signed soon after construction begins.\nThe projects contribute to a growing pipeline of Class A\noffice development\nin the Cultural District, a rare point of optimism in a generally sluggish DFW office market.\nCrescent Real Estate plans to build a\n170,000-square-foot Class A office building\nalong West 7th Street as part of its $250 million Crescent Fort Worth development, while Larkspur Capital and Robert Bass\u2019 Keystone Group aim to include office space in their\n$850 million mixed-use development\nnear Cullen Street.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "A losing bidder for the Kingsbridge Armory redevelopment is gearing up for a battle.\nAgallas Equities filed a lawsuit in state court, demanding a judge annul the contract that gave the Bronx site to Joy Construction and Maddd Equities, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The suit was filed two months after the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation picked the Joy and Maddd venture\nas the winning bidder\nto redevelop the site.\nAgallas and its leader, Manuel Tavarez, allege that the developer\u2019s proposal was almost chosen, presenting a drafted press release in support of the case. Partners in Agallas\u2019 bid \u2014 including the McKissack Group, Exact Capital Group and JV Construction &amp; Consulting \u2014 have not joined the lawsuit.\nThe lawsuit claims the EDC was tainted by favoritism and political influence. Agallas also alleges the Maddd/Joy team was given access to Agallas\u2019 proposal and borrowed elements from the plan, pushing that proposal over the finish line.\n\u201cThe procurement process conducted by EDC was arbitrary and capricious, and tainted by political influence, conflicts of interests, procedural irregularities, and the misappropriation of Petitioner\u2019s intellectual property in their proprietary proposal,\u201d the lawsuit reads.\nAgallas may have another problem, which it acknowledges in its complaint. The developer said it wasn\u2019t able to put down the $2.5 million security deposit, $250,000 administrative fee and $200,000 environmental consultant fee required in the bidding, which the EDC used to reject the bid.\n\n\u201cAfter a rigorous evaluation of all proposals, NYCEDC selected El Centro Kingsbridge\u2019s proposal, which is consistent with the values of the Kingsbridge Vision Plan and the requirements of the RFP,\u201d an EDC spokesperson said in a statement.\nA spokesperson for the winning bid put out its own statement, saying it was \u201cproud of the restorative plan we have put forward for the historic Kingsbridge Armory \u2014 a plan that includes many community priorities that were laid out during the public visioning process.\u201d\nThe $600 million redevelopment plan from Maddd and Joy includes event space, sports fields, a workforce development education center, and eventually, 450 housing units.\nAgallas\u2019 proposal, meanwhile, initially included community space, 275 units of housing, a four-star hotel, an \u201cInternational Salsa Museum\u201d and sports fields, which was later replaced with an entertainment venue. It allegedly signed a term sheet in August.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Former HFZ Capital Group executive\nNir Meir\nis out of jail after spending more than a year detained on Riker\u2019s Island.\nMeir was released on a $1 million fully secured bail bond. Meir will be in 24-hour home confinement and will wear two ankle monitors, one from the New York City Sheriff and the other from his bail bond agency, according to his attorney, Oliver Storch.\n\u201cWe are elated that Mr. Meir can now finally and reasonably review the voluminous discovery with counsel and fight the charges in a meaningful way,\u201d said Storch in a statement.\nMeir will live in an undisclosed residence in New York City. He will only be permitted to leave his home for court appearances and pre-approved attorney visits. On these visits, Meir will be escorted by a bail bond agent, Storch said.\nIt is unclear who is paying for Meir\u2019s residence. Meir previously claimed to be broke with no significant assets to his name.\nProsecutors allege Meir was the mastermind of an $86 million fraud scheme that involved moving money out of accounts designated for HFZ Capital Group projects, resulting in shortfalls. At the center of the allegations is\nthe XI, a condo development\non Manhattan\u2019s High Line. The D.A.\u2019s office also alleges Meir defrauded the city out of $15 million in taxes.\nMeir has pleaded not guilty and maintains his innocence, Storch said.\nStorch had tried to reduce Meir\u2019s bail \u2014 $5 million cash bail, $7.5 million insurance bond and $10 million partially secured bond \u2014 arguing that what the judge initially set was too high. The attorney claimed Meir was not a flight risk.\n\nIn February, Judge Ann Thompson agreed that Meir\u2019s initial bail was \u201cexcessive\u201d but largely denied Meir\u2019s request to reduce it below $1 million.\nInstead of appealing the decision, Storch said he proposed an \u201cunprecedented and extraordinarily restrictive, compelling bail package which reasonably addressed the DA Office\u2019s and court\u2019s flight risk concerns.\u201d\nThe D.A.\u2019s office agreed to reduce the bail amount on the condition that Meir wear two separate ankle monitors and remain in home confinement.\nIn the initial indictment, the D.A.\u2019s office also alleged the XI\u2019s contractor, Omnibuild, and its CEO John Mingione worked with Meir to inflate costs to the lender. Omnibuild and Mingione have pleaded not guilty and claim to be victims of Meir and HFZ\u2019s bad acts.\nThe D.A.\u2019s office recently agreed to pursue the case against Omnibuild and Mingione separately from Meir.\n\u201cWe are very pleased with the D.A.\u2019s office agreeing to finally separate Nir and HFZ from our case,\u201d said a spokesperson for Omnibuild and Mingione. \u201cWe were the first people to warn the D.A.\u2019s office about Nir\u2019s fraudulent acts and were victims of his theft. Omnibuild and John are absolutely innocent and this decision is a significant step forward in our fight to being fully exonerated.\u201d\nMeir was fired from HFZ in late 2020. He spent the next two years fighting lawsuits while dropping millions of dollars on gold, strip clubs, expensive wine and hotel stays, in addition to a $150,000-a-month rental in Miami Beach. Despite his large expenditures, Meir claimed he was broke and the money came from his ex-wife Ranee Bartolacci.\nMeir filed for personal bankruptcy in February 2024 and was ultimately\narrested\nthat same month at the 1 Hotel South Beach residences. Meir was extradited to New York City and subsequently held in Rikers.\n",

        "content": "Billionaire developer Steve Ross advanced his plan to develop a kindergarten-through-12th-grade private school on 55 acres of city-owned land in West Palm Beach near Florida\u2019s Turnpike.\nThe West Palm Beach City Commission on Monday voted unanimously to declare the 55-acre site as surplus city land and authorize negotiations based on a term sheet for the sale of the property to Related Southeast, LLC, also known as Ross\u2019 Related Ross.\nIn the non-binding term sheet, the proposed sale price of the 55-acre site is $6.6 million, the average of appraisals obtained by the city ($3.7 million) and\nRelated Ross ($9.5 million). City commissioners also waived a municipal requirement for an update of the appraisals, which were conducted about a year ago.\u00a0 The undeveloped land is south of Roebuck Road and east of Florida\u2019s Turnpike.\nThe term sheet grants Related Ross six months to conduct due diligence evaluations of the 55-acre site to determine its suitability for a private school and, potentially, workforce housing for faculty and staff. Related Ross would recruit a company to operate the private school and may retain part of the site to develop workforce housing, if the entire site isn\u2019t needed for the school.\nAfter the due diligence period,\nRelated Ross\nand the city would try to negotiate a purchase and sale agreement, subject to approval by the city commission. If they agree on a price for the 55-acre site, the city will submit and process an application to rezone the property for school use.\n\n\u201cThis is the first step in a process,\u201d West Palm Beach Mayor Keith A. James said during the commission meeting.\nProceeds from the land sale would go to Roosevelt Elementary School in West Palm Beach, a public school operated by Palm Beach County. \u201cRoosevelt Elementary is in dire need of improvement,\u201d Mayor James said. \u201cIt\u2019s an F-rated school.\u201d\nAfter years of overseeing Related Companies\u2019 developments in\nWest Palm Beach\nand elsewhere in Palm Beach County,\nRoss\nstepped back from New York-based Related Companies, which he founded, and carved out its Related Southeast division as the separate Related Ross that he leads as chairman and CEO. Ross remains non-executive chairman of Related Companies.\nRoss\u2019 heightened focus on South Florida dates to 2021 when he went on an office shopping spree, purchasing three towers and completed a fourth in downtown West Palm Beach. Since then, he has continued to develop in the area, completing the 322-unit\nLaurel\napartment tower last year and the 25-story\nOne Flagler\noffice building this year. Next, Related Ross plans\n10 CityPlace and 15 CityPlace\noffice towers and is developing the two-tower, 108-unit\nSouth Flagler House\ncondo project.\nRoss, 84, also plans to focus more of his time on the Miami Dolphins and Formula One race, both of which hold their sporting events at Ross\u2019\nHard Rock Stadium\nin Miami Gardens.\nRoss, who grew up in both South Florida and Detroit, graduated from Miami Beach Senior High School and attended the University of Florida. He has owned a home in Palm Beach for about 20 years and permanently moved there during the pandemic.",

        "content": "A senior housing facility just hit one of Chicago\u2019s most competitive rental markets and could be converted to typical apartments.\nVentas, a Chicago-based healthcare real estate investment trust, listed its 14-story property at 3121 North Sheridan Road for sale, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nBrookdale Senior Living operates an independent and assisted living community in the building, but it is declining to renew its lease as part of a broader exit from dozens of similar properties across the country.\nLocated in Lakeview, one of Chicago\u2019s highest-demand and supply-constrained neighborhoods, the listing offers buyers the opportunity to convert the building\u2019s 256 units into market-rate apartments. Occupancy in the submarket hit a record-high 95.8 percent as of March, with rents rising 4.6 percent year-over-year, according to Berkadia.\nThe building is one of 11 being sold by Ventas after Brookdale opted not to renew its master lease for 55 senior living communities. Ventas is retaining and folding the remaining 44 properties into its operating portfolio.\nThe Sheridan Road listing is the only Chicago-area property being offered for sale. Berkadia brokers Pete Evans and Richard Evans have the listing.\n\nThe 1950-built tower has not traded hands in more than two decades. It last sold in 1998 for $16.8 million ($66,000 per unit) to Provident Senior Living Trust, which was acquired by Ventas in 2005.\nAt an average of 566 square feet, the units are smaller than standard apartments, but could be upgraded or reconfigured. There may be potential to add units as well, the outlet reported.\nThe listing adds to a growing trend of adaptive reuses and conversions across Chicago\u2019s rental landscape, especially in older buildings that no longer suit their original purpose.\nRecent deals and development shifts highlight both opportunity and caution in the hot Lakeview submarket: Randolph Street Realty Capital\npaid over $40 million\nfor the 140-unit Panorama Apartments in January, while Mavrek Development\nscaled back a planned 210-unit project\nlast month to just 46 units at 925 West Belmont Avenue amid financing challenges.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Tal Alexander no longer has a connection to the Billionaires\u2019 Row property he proudly flaunted while building his profile as a top New York City luxury broker.\nAlexander\u2019s estranged wife, Arielle Alexander, vacated the apartment Monday night in advance of the lease expiring on April 1. Arielle, who gave birth to the couple\u2019s first child late last year,\nfiled for divorce\nin January.\nTal has been in federal custody since his arrest in December. He and his brothers, Oren and Alon Alexander, are being held at Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.\nThe owner of the unit, whose identity is hidden, last week served Tal with a\nnonpayment notice\nfor allegedly failing to pay rent for March, setting the former top broker up for possible eviction. The unit is currently on the market, asking $55,000 a month, according to\nStreetEasy\n.\nAdam Turbowitz, an attorney for Arielle, confirmed that she moved out of the apartment.\nTal moved into the Billionaires\u2019 Row supertall, developed by CIM Group and Macklowe Properties, in 2019, according to a post on his Facebook page. He wrote that the building was representative of the \u201cpinnacle lifestyle\u201d in New York.\n\u201cHere\u2019s to manifesting ideas that in turn become a reality @alexanderteam @officialpartners,\u201d he wrote last year on\nFacebook\n.\nThe unit came into the spotlight when the FBI arrested Tal, Oren and Alon on sex trafficking charges in December. Tal was arrested at his parents\u2019 waterfront home in Bal Harbour after taking a last-minute flight, while Oren and Alon were arrested at their respective Miami Beach homes. The brothers have denied the allegations.\n\nAuthorities said in January they recovered videos and photos at the 432 Park apartment that show Oren and Alon, along with unidentified third parties, \u201cengaged in sexual contact\u201d with apparently intoxicated women.\nThe videos showed at least one of the brothers and another man \u201cphysically manipulated the women\u2019s bodies to have sex with them while the women did not actively participate in the sexual activity or turned away,\u201d prosecutors wrote.\nThe hard drive containing the videos was found in a closet that seemed to include items that belonged to Oren, who previously lived at the apartment, according to prosecutors.\nThe FBI also raided Oren and Alon\u2019s homes the day of their arrests.\nAs part of a bail package that federal judges ultimately rejected, criminal defense attorney Howard Srebnick\noffered Tal\u2019s apartment\nfor the brothers to stay in during their upcoming trial in New York. At the time, Srebnick said he didn\u2019t know the address, but described it as an apartment \u201con a higher floor with no balconies.\u201d\nTal planned to move to Miami with Arielle and their infant son into a new home he was building in Miami Beach, according to his attorney, Jason Goldman. But the former top broker has been in custody on federal sex trafficking charges since December.\nIt\u2019s unknown where Arielle is headed after vacating the Billionaires\u2019 Row unit.\n",

The loan allows for borrowing up to $60 million, property records show.

        "content": "A 1960s office building in Downers Grove is poised for demolition to make way for a sprawling distribution center under plans advanced by Bridge Industrial.\nThe Chicago-based developer\u2019s LLC received a unanimous recommendation from the Downers Grove Planning and Zoning Commission to rezone and subdivide two adjacent parcels at 2300 and 2500 Warrenville Road, according to public records.\nThe project would involve razing the two-story, 105,800-square-foot office building at 2300 Warrenville to build a 243,000-square-foot single-story industrial building in its place.\nOfficials cited the building\u2019s outdated structure and market shifts away from suburban office campuses as justification for the zoning change.\nThe property owner is Ramsey Elshafei\u2019s RE Development Solutions, which bought the buildings from Pennsylvania developer Patriot Equities in December 2017, according to DuPage County records. RE Development paid $9.95 million for 2500 Warrenville and $7.45 million ($70 per square foot) for 2300 Warrenville.\nThe property would be rezoned from light manufacturing to office-research-manufacturing. The development could house operations in warehousing, light manufacturing, food processing or the fabrication of custom interiors, according to documents submitted to the Village. But Bridge hasn\u2019t announced a tenant.\nThe developer\u2019s plans call for 164 parking spaces and multiple truck docks. The developer will also install underground stormwater detention systems and a sidewalk along Warrenville Road as part of public infrastructure improvements.\n\nThe facility aims to answer demand for distribution space near major transportation corridors. The project site lies just off the Interstate 88 and Interstate 355 interchange, an area the village\u2019s comprehensive plan identifies as a hub for large-scale, high-value corporate campuses and industrial facilities.\nConstruction is expected to begin in the second or third quarter, pending final approvals and permitting, with completion slated for late 2026.\nThe redevelopment aligns with recent economic trends that have seen former office users increasingly opting for modern, high-clearance industrial buildings, steadily reshaping suburban commercial corridors.\nIndustrial leasing\nsurged last year\nas high interest rates curbed new construction. Vacancy dropped from 5.29 the first quarter 2024 to 4.7 percent in the fourth, according to\nColliers\n.\nBuild-to-suit industrial projects made up 83 percent of the active construction pipeline in the fourth quarter, while spec deliveries marked the third-lowest amount recorded in the past nine years at 1.6 million square feet.\nOther players are betting on an industrial revival in Downer\u2019s Grove, where Amazon inked a deal for more than 650,000 square feet of warehouse space\njust before the pandemic\n. Dallas-based Westmount Realty Capital acquired a\nnine-building, 391,000-square-foot industrial portfolio\nin DuPage County from Unilev Capital and Mandalay Industrial in February, when it was 91 percent leased.\n",

His 100-square-foot pad has a sink, mini-fridge and a shared kitchen and bathroom, not unlike a single-room occupancy hotel room.\n\u201cIf you are a single person like me you are focused mainly on building your company,\u201d said Vora. \u201cThere are so many founders living in these buildings \u2014 we all share this mindset of building AI technology to solve large-scale problems.\u201d\nThe co-living industry, which fizzled in San Francisco during the pandemic, has rebounded \u2014 fueled by young entrepreneurs flooding into town to join the AI boom, according to the Chronicle.\nInternational co-living firms are taking advantage of San Francisco\u2019s weak pandemic recovery to buy or lease buildings on the cheap.\nSouth Africa-based Neighbourgood has opened three co-living buildings with 53 rooms \u2014 one in the North of the Panhandle and two in the Mission, according to the Chronicle.\nIt\u2019s also in escrow to buy a 12-room historic guest house at 1409 Sutter Street, between Gough and Franklin streets. Neighbourgood CEO Murray Clark says it has big plans for San Francisco: cafes, co-working spots and a high concentration of apartments and rooms.\n\u201cWe want to get to 1,000 in the next 24 to 36 months and 2,500 in the next five to seven years,\u201d he told the Chronicle. \u201cWe are seeing deals that we are not seeing anywhere else because of the pressure San Francisco has been under. In my mind there are too many smart people in San Francisco for it not to improve. It\u2019s too cool a city.\u201d\n\nBarcelona-based Enso Co-Living, which runs 690 rooms in Spain and Mexico, aims to set up shop with co-living locations in San Francisco this year, according to Pablo Gomez, the company vice president of expansion and growth.\n\u201cSan Francisco is a top city we are looking at expanding to,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cYou have a lot of ex-pats, you have Silicon Valley, you have a lot of people who need flexibility because they are moving all around the place.\u201d\nThe co-living business, hammered by the pandemic, hurt prominent companies.\nLocally based Starcity was facing bankruptcy when it was acquired by Common in 2021. Common, based in New York,\nfiled for Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nlast year after once operating a U.S. portfolio of 5,200 units in 12 cities. HubHaus, which turned single-family homes into co-living communities, also went belly up.\nUrbaNests, which leases and owns co-living buildings, had to downsize in order to survive. Occupancy went from nearly 100 percent to 70 percent vacant.\nWhile rents are still down 25 percent from 2019, and the number of rooms Urbanest runs has dropped to 440 from about 1,000, executives say its portfolio is now \u201cstabilized\u201d to 85 percent occupancy.\nTony Brettkelly, its CEO, just took over the empty Inn at Market tourist hotel at 1412 Market Street, which he\u2019s now converting to an AI-specific \u201chacker house.\u201d He\u2019s also scouring the city for other buildings to buy or lease.\n\u201cThese kids are not looking for luxury,\u201d he told the Chronicle. \u201cThey want things to be really functional and be stimulated by the people around them. That is what we are trying to achieve.\u201d\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "Floyd Mayweather, Jr. turned industry heads last October with a\nrecord-scratch\nof a deal: $402 million for 1,000 affordable units in Upper Manhattan.\nBlack Spruce Management owned the buildings. Details, otherwise, were scant.\nIn February,\nMayweather\noffered a bit more color in an Instagram post flaunting his new assets and the investment firm he\u2019d launched to buy them: Vada Properties.\n\u201cLately, I purchased 62 apartment buildings in New York City,\u201d the retired boxer said in a\nvideo\n.\n\u201cGuess what: All the buildings belong to me; I don\u2019t have no partners.\u201d\nOn Monday, Business Insider\nseized\non those words in an article questioning whether the deal had happened at all. Property sales show up in city records, but weeks after Mayweather\u2019s post, nothing had been recorded.\n\u201cThere is no evidence there has been a sale,\u201d the publication reported.\nThe truth lies somewhere in the middle.\nMayweather did ink a $402 million deal for a Black Spruce portfolio, sources close to the transaction confirmed. The heavyweight champ scored a minority stake in most of the 62-building portfolio and an option to buy the remaining properties outright.\nJost Gotlib\u2019s\nBlack Spruce\nis still the majority owner, which is why a sale didn\u2019t hit records \u2014 a deed didn\u2019t change hands. The firm declined to comment.\nAs for Mayweather\u2019s word choice, his team ascribed it to miscommunication. When the former athlete said he didn\u2019t have partners, he meant no one was funding his investment but him.\n\u201cThe money I used to purchase all of the real estate deals is my own hard-earned money,\u201d Mayweather said in a statement. \u201cI didn\u2019t raise it, syndicate it or borrow it.\u201d\n\nWord choice aside, a check in on the deal reveals Mayweather has tapped into a novel strategy to squeeze profits from assets most believe to be dying on the vine.\nThe Morningside Heights portfolio is rent-stabilized and, notably, collateral for\nSignature Bank debt\nthe industry called \u201ctoxic\u201d after the lender flopped in 2023.\nSince a 2019 law severely curbed revenues in rent-stabilized buildings,\nvalues have plunged\nand\ndefaults mushroomed\n. Many owners, seeing no other path to profit, are swallowing their pride, selling to bottom feeders and trying to move on.\nIt doesn\u2019t seem that Mayweather spent hundreds of millions on that type of distressed investment.\nMany of the Morningside Heights buildings benefit from two government programs \u2014 Article XI and Section 610.\nArticle XI is a complicated tax cut with an incredible 40-year lifespan for properties that have been renovated; it provides a break on the expense side of the operating equation.\nBlack Spruce secured the exemption for much of the portfolio before Mayweather came on board and expects to lock it down for the remaining properties, sources said.\nArticle XI is another reason Mayweather did not buy the deals outright, the sources added. The city needs to approve the sales of properties that benefit from the program, which is complicated enough. Getting the green light for deals in the processing stage would have been an added headache.\nSection 610, meanwhile, acts as a revenue booster.\nUnder a 2022 state law, the program allows owners leasing to voucher holders to collect the full subsidy amount, even if it\u2019s above the unit\u2019s legal rent. That can be a hefty differential for landlords of older rent-stabilized buildings with rents capped far below market.\nAt least one-third of the buildings in the Morningside Heights deal scored Section 610 in October, according to property records \u2014 a lucky break and good timing.\nThe city, citing federal uncertainty, said last week it would\nno longer\naccept new applications for the program, which allegedly had a waitlist in the thousands.\n",

        "content": "Two developers\u2019 deals to build apartment projects on county-owned land breezed through approvals, with plans for a total of nearly 6,000 units.\nOn Tuesday, in separate actions, the Miami-Dade County Commission voted unanimously and without discussion to approve 99-year ground leases with a Michael Swerdlow-led joint venture and with\nRelated Urban\n, the affordable and workforce housing arm of Coconut Grove-based Related Group.\nSwerdlo\nw and Related Urban, led by Albert Milo, are planning separate mixed-use developments with affordable and workforce units in Little River and Spring Garden, respectively.\nLittle River District\nIn the bigger deal, Swerdlow, SJM Partners and Alben Duffie seek to build Little River District, an estimated $3 billion mixed-use project on 63 acres in Miami\u2019s Little River neighborhood with 5,730 apartments; 370,000 square feet of commercial space; 250,000 square feet of open space and amenities; and a new Tri-Rail passenger train station.\n\nSwerdlow and his partners were the sole bidders in a competitive process to redevelop five of 10 existing public housing projects with a combined 314 units completed between the 1950s and 1970s. Residents of the buildings will be relocated to Little River District, a county memo states.\nThe joint venture agreed to pay the county $5.3 million in annual lease payments, and 30 percent of the estimated $37.6 million developer fee. Should Swerdlow and his partners sell or refinance the development, Miami-Dade would receive 16 percent of the proceeds, a county memo states. Miami-Dade staff estimates the ground lease could generate $9.6 billion to the county over 99 years.\nGallery at Riverwalk\nRelated Urban\nis getting a 99-year ground lease allowing the firm to develop Gallery at Riverwalk, a 19-story building with 236 apartments and 1,550 square feet of retail on a vacant 1-acre site at 1175 Northwest South River Drive. The developer is setting aside 216 units for affordable and workforce housing. To qualify for the affordable housing apartments, low income tenants can only make up to 80 percent of the county\u2019s average median income of $79,400.\nThe county would receive an annual rent payment of $1.2 million, a 16.5 percent share of the project\u2019s annual net operating income and an estimated $4.5 million developer\u2019s fee, a county memo states. Miami-Dade would receive an estimated total of $280.2 million over the life of the 99-year lease.\nLast year,\nRelated Urban\nwon a competitive bidding process for the development site, county records show.",

        "content": "California housing officials are keeping an eye on Rancho Palos Verdes.\nThe coastal city known for dramatic cliffs, horse trails and eye-popping home prices wants to scrap its housing element and draft a new one after Ali Vahdani applied to build 14 townhomes and two cottages on a 1.6-acre vacant lot with dramatic views of Abalone Cove and Catalina Island beyond. In city planning circles it\u2019s known simply as \u201cClipper Site #16.\u201d\nThe uproar over the project and the city\u2019s efforts to block it has brought Rancho Palos Verdes into dubious legal territory, according to Vahdani\u2019s lawyer, Rand Paster &amp; Nelson\u2019s Dave Rand and pro-housing groups. Now, the City Council is weighing a proposal they say is illegal.\n\u201cThe Clipper site will become synonymous with housing dysfunction,\u201d Rand said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing for cities to adopt restrictive zoning. This is infinitely worse and more cynical.\u201d\nVahdani, a civil engineer and founder of Optimum Seismic, made a well-timed bet on the property three years ago, just as the city was drawing up its plan to increase density and make room for 647 more homes, as required by the state\u2019s Housing Element Law. Vahdani, who lives in Glendale, is a well-known figure in Rancho Palos Verdes, where he does business, owns real estate and contributes to local campaigns, including former Mayor John Cruikshank, according to financial disclosures and county property records. But he\u2019s never developed housing from the ground up before, Vahdani told\nThe Real Deal\n. The Clipper site would be his first attempt at doing so, and he had a vision to make \u201ca boutique development to be proud of.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working on this particular property for the past two years,\u201d Vahdani told the city\u2019s planning commission in October 2021. At the time, he was in escrow to buy Clipper Site #16. \u201cI always had a vision of developing it to be a very nice property, of course supporting the wishes of the neighborhood and working closely with the staff.\u201d\nVahdani bought the parcel in April 2022 for $2.2 million \u2014\nslightly less\nthan its tax-assessed value at the time \u2014 from Thomas and Shannon Hartman, who raised their children in a home on the other side of the block.\nThe Hartmans never developed the empty lot, though it was zoned for up to four homes. The family opted instead to use it for Easter egg hunts and family picnics, according to a source who lives in the neighborhood and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\nFour months later, the city adopted its 6th Cycle Housing Element, a set of commitments it\u2019s required to make to contribute to the state\u2019s housing plan. As part of its plan, Rancho Palos Verdes upzoned the Hartman lot to accommodate eight more units, for a total of 12.\nBy then, Rancho Palos Verdes was\nracing against time\n. It needed to certify its housing element to cut off the flow of builder\u2019s remedy projects, where developers jump past local review to add housing by-right, including\nAkhlilesh Jha\n\u2019s 482-unit affordable housing\nproposal in Silver Spur\n. The threat of such megaprojects looms large in Southern California, where\nmany cities\nare failing\nto keep up with\nthe state\u2019s timeline to develop and adopt a local housing plan.\nRancho Palos Verdes hired\nland use consultant Dudek\nto help it come up with a list of three sites that could be further upzoned to add more housing, and the City Council\nadopted a new zoning ordinance\nthat did so last April.\nVahdani stood to profit further. According to\nthe revised plan\n, he can now build up to 22 homes on his property, if he can find a safe way to fit them on the sloping, irregular site.\nComplicating matters is the 250-million-year-old\nlandslide\nabout a mile east, which is causing California to slip into the sea at a rate of about one foot per week. Many homes there are under evacuation, and the feeling of \u201cliving on the edge\u201d pervades the city.\nBut Clipper Site #16 is not at risk, according to Megan Barnes, a spokesperson for the city manager. But builders in the area have to undertake geotechnical and soil analyses in order to get projects entitled, Barnes added in an email to\nThe Real Deal.\nVahdani wasted no time filing a preliminary application last November to develop 16 homes on the site, one of which would be affordable to a very low-income household, and he was soon on his way to becoming a home builder on the Palos Verdes Peninsula.\nThe winter of discontent in Abalone Cove\nThe proposal came as a shock, since new housing is seldom proposed in Rancho Palos Verdes. The city has issued permits for a mere 14 new housing units over the past year, all of them accessory dwelling units, or small cottages built next to single-family homes, according to\na city planning report\npublished in March.\n\u201cWe already have enough housing. That lot never needed to be in there,\u201d Shannon Hartman pleaded in a public hearing last month. \u201cIt\u2019s in a landslide area with movement all around.\u201d\nThe public outcry over Vahdani\u2019s proposal mounted over four months, with neighbors citing the purported risk posed by the nearby landslide, the impact on their property values and the character of the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cThis is a single-family area and we\u2019re doing everything we can to keep that,\u201d another resident testified last month.\nDesperate for a way to block Vahdani\u2019s project, Rancho Palos Verdes City Council drew up a plan to go back to the drawing board and submit a new Housing Element removing Clipper Site #16 and two other sites from the plan.\n\u201cI was devastated,\u201d Vahdani said. \u201cI never built 16 houses from scratch. I\u2019m not a big developer. I was working on this for three years, paying a lot of consultants and architects. I saw it as totally unfair, totally crazy. I couldn\u2019t believe they were going to downzone it months later.\u201d\nThe sudden about-face would undo years of work.\nSubmitting a new housing element would require more rounds of public review, planning commission approval and another City Council vote. In addition, the city also needs to withdraw its Local Coastal Program amendment and submit a new one removing the sites.\n\u201cThe reason these sites were selected for consideration of removal was due to the number of units they would produce,\u201d Barnes stated in an email to\nTRD.\nState housing officials reviewed the changes and approved them.\nThat\u2019s when Rand the attorney went into battle mode. And now, nonprofit law firm YIMBY Law has also stepped in to say, \u2018\u201cnot so fast.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re in an interjurisdictional quagmire,\u201d said Rand. \u201cThe city put this site in the housing element. They did everything to invite development on this property, only to walk it back when it became politically challenging for them.\u201d\nFurthermore, the last-minute revisions are illegal, and would likely subject the city to the dreaded builder\u2019s remedy, according to Californians for Homeownership and YIMBY law.\nThe city cannot deny Vahdani\u2019s vested rights to develop the property after he filed his preliminary application in November, YIMBY Law executive director Sonja Trauss warned in a March 17 letter to the Rancho Palos Verdes City Council. The state\u2019s 2019 Housing Crisis Act, also known as SB 330, bars Rancho Palos Verdes from undoing the zoning ordinance it adopted last April in order to block a development.\n\u201cThe options in front of you are to respect the efforts of your staff which led to a Housing Element and subsequent rezoning and an application consistent with those measures, or to waste time and open yourselves to our lawsuit,\u201d Trauss wrote.\nThe warning seems to have landed.\nThe City Council was set to vote on taking the first step to unravel its housing element the following day. Instead, the body put the vote off indefinitely, much to the chagrin of Vahdani\u2019s neighbors.\n\u201cThere are many things the city cannot control,\u201d Rancho Palos Verdes Mayor David Bradley conceded in\nthe March 18 meeting\n. \u201cWhile we are very sympathetic to many things that have been said tonight, there are only a limited amount of things that the city can do. Sacramento has changed the housing laws in the state of California in dramatic fashion, generally in favor of the developers.\u201d\nThe state housing agency, Housing and Community Development, for its part, took a back seat to the drama. A spokesperson for the agency said in an email to\nTRD:\n\u201cHCD does not have authority to require a city to include or exclude particular sites, only to evaluate whether the sites identified by the local jurisdiction are, among other requirements, adequate, suitable and available.\u201d\nThat said, the city must \u201chonor the zoning that existed at the time the project application was submitted due to the application of SB 330, which was passed in 2019,\u201d the spokesperson added.\nRand isn\u2019t going anywhere. He\nlet loose\nabout his client\u2019s situation on X last month.\n\u201cThings happen in land use that cause me to question whether CA can ever figure it out,\u201d Rand wrote on X. \u201cWe are fighting it like hell.\u201d\n",

        "content": "AmTrust RE\u2019s office building renovations started to pay off recently, as it scored two new tenants and renewed three in a vacancy-plagued market.\nThe insurance giant\u2019s real estate arm owns 1 East Wacker and recently completed extensive renovations in hopes of luring tenants. It spent $50 million on renovations across 1 East Wacker Drive and 33 North Dearborn Street.\nSo far AmTrust\u2019s renovations have helped secure at least five tenants at One East Wacker. Fintech company Aeropay and a nonprofit, The Lawyer\u2019s Trust Fund of Illinois, recently signed leases in the building totalling 17,500 square feet.\nThe gains at 1 East Wacker are losses for other landlords down the road. Aeropay is leaving Ameritus and Madison International\u2019s 121 West Waker Drive, where it had a smaller lease. The Lawyers Trust Fund is leaving 65 East Wacker Place, a 24-story building that Mavrek Development and Acres Commercial Realty plan to\nconvert to 200 apartments\n.\nMeanwhile, AmTrust secured lease renewals with business services nonprofit the Japan Trade Organization, law firm Gair, Gallo and Eberhard, and real estate consultancy ECD Company. The renewals total 18,700 square feet, including an expansion of the law firm\u2019s space.\n\nStream Realty Partners represented AmTrust RE in all five transactions. Paul Reaumond and Tyler Reaumond of CBRE represented Aeropay, and Boris Yelyashov and Kyle Robbins of Transwestern represented the Japan Trade Organization.\nThe 41-story, 560,000-square-foot office tower overlooking the riverwalk is part of AmTrust RE\u2019s seven-property portfolio in Chicago. The company is planning to spend another $50 million to overhaul the portfolio. At 1 East Wacker, the improvements included an updated lobby, amenities spaces and a lounge.\nBut it hasn\u2019t been all smooth sailing for the New York-based landlord. AmTrust RE\nwas hit with a foreclosure lawsuit\nin November by Starwood\u2019s special servicer LNR Partners alleging the property owner defaulted on its $260 million loan for the office buildings at 111 East Wacker Drive, also known as One Illinois Center, and 233 North Michigan Avenue.\nThe company also owns office buildings in New York, Phoenix and Tampa.\nLeasing activity picked up in Chicago in the first quarter, particularly among Class A office buildings. The quarter was the second most active for office leasing since the pandemic began, and nine of the 10 largest leases were for Class A buildings, according to Savills.\n",

        "content": "The deal to trade Houston\u2019s One City Centre is final, and its previously undisclosed buyer has been identified.\nDelaware Street Capital purchased the chronically distressed office building that was 9 percent occupied in September, deed records show.\nThe sale represented a realized loss of $83.3 million ($137 per square foot) on the two CMBS loans backed by the property at 1021 Main Street, Morningstar Credit reported. The loans, which originated in 2015, totalled $100 million. They\u2019ve been in special servicing since 2021 after the departure of the building\u2019s largest tenant, Waste Management (now WM), in December 2020.\nThe 607,500-square-foot, 32-story building\u2019s taxable value is $25.9 million, less than $43 per square foot, according to the Harris Central Appraisal district.\nOne City Centre, originally called the First City National Bank Building, was built in 1960 and is located in downtown Houston.\nAfter owner Accesso Partners failed to lease the building\u2019s vacant space, special servicer Midland listed the property in October 2023; potential buyers made their final offers in March. Morningstar Credit\nrevealed a buyer was selected\nin September but did not identify the buyer.\n\nJLL, which had the listing, marketed the property as a potential candidate for a conversion to multifamily. It\u2019s also located in an\nOpportunity Zone\nand could qualify for tax breaks.\nDelaware Street Capital couldn\u2019t be reached to comment on its plans for the building.\nDespite the excitement around turning empty office buildings into housing, conversions have proven to be expensive and tricky, and few have been successfully executed.\nEven so, the Texas Legislature is weighing whether to make the process easier for developers by\nremoving requirements\nto get zoning changes for properties that are converted into residential projects.\nFiguring out how to make conversions work would be especially helpful in Houston, where the office market vacancy rate rose to 27 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Colliers. The high rate is traceable to older office properties, like One City Centre, which have become obsolete.\n",

        "content": "For agents in Manhattan, it paid to be trading at the top last quarter.\nThe borough\u2019s residential market picked up steam in the first three months of the year, powered by rising prices and an uptick in sales in the luxury sector, according to Miller Samuel\u2019s quarterly report for Douglas Elliman.\nWith mortgage rates still hovering well above 6 percent, the luxury segment \u2014 defined in the report as the top 10 percent of sales \u2014 outpaced the overall market, as most buyers close deals with cash, report author Jonathan Miller said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s where all the action is,\u201d Miller said.\nMiller also pointed to the stock market\u2019s downturn as a potential catalyst for deals, as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration prepares to roll out new trade policies \u2014 \u201ctariff tantrums,\u201d as Miller called them.\n\u201cMy thinking is that maybe there was some urgency to move sooner rather than later, before there was more damage in the financial markets,\u201d Miller said.\nLuxury co-op and condo sales in Manhattan rose nearly 30 percent in the first quarter, up to 250 from 200 in the same period last year. The average sale price of a luxury home grew 37 percent year-over-year to $10.3 million \u2014 the highest quarterly average on record.\n\nLast month, a financier\u2019s condo at 150 Charles Street set a new Downtown Manhattan record when it sold for\n$60 million\nin an off-market deal. The closing price was nearly double what the sellers, investment services executive Harsh Padia and his wife, interior designer Purvi Padia, paid for it in 2016.\nWith deals on the rise, inventory in the luxury sector fell sharply, with fewer new listings hitting the market to cover the gap. Last quarter, the number of listings dropped 24 percent annually, down from more than 1,600 to roughly 1,200.\nWhile luxury listings dipped, inventory in the overall market rose slightly in the first quarter. Co-op and condo listings across the borough increased roughly 8 percent year-over-year, up from 6,900 to 7,400.\nTransactions and sale prices also ticked upwards last quarter, though Miller cautioned that the scale of the increases is \u201csomewhat exaggerated\u201d because the first quarter of 2024 was \u201cunusually weak.\u201d\nThe number of closed sales was up 29 percent in the first quarter, from 2,000 to 2,600. The average sales price hit $2.2 million, a 21 percent uptick from $1.8 million in the same period last year.\nThough the metrics were likely skewed by the market\u2019s performance in the first quarter, Miller said the positive growth was still a sign of urgency among consumers.\n\u201cThe numbers are higher for a reason,\u201d Miller said.\n",

        "content": "The \u201cIt\u201d buildings in each of\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s markets are condo developments that typify the moment in their regions, according to brokers, insiders and our reporters\u2019 carefully honed instincts.\nYou can read the full series\nhere\n.\nIn New York City, a new luxury tower in the West Village is shaping up to be the one to watch \u2014 partly because there isn\u2019t much else to look at.\nManhattan brokers have been anxiously awaiting the arrival of 80 Clarkson Street, the planned 113-unit condo portion of Zeckendorf Development and Atlas Capital Group\u2019s two-tower project on the Hudson River.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the big one that everyone is interested in,\u201d John Gomes, the co-founder of Douglas Elliman\u2019s top-producing Eklund-Gomes Team, said. \u201cThat\u2019s the one everybody wants to get into, the one everyone wants to sell in.\u201d\nIt\u2019s one of few developments of its size, and likely price point, on its way up in the borough. An offering plan filed last summer includes pricing for just 22 of the tower\u2019s units, ranging from nearly $7 million for a two-bedroom apartment to $63 million for a five-bedroom, two-terrace condo on the 31st floor. But complete pricing is still a mystery.\nThe new development is nearly unrivaled in Lower Manhattan, where just last month, buyers proved they\u2019re willing to pay record prices for apartments. (A penthouse at the Witkoff Group\u2019s 150 Charles traded for $60 million in March, setting a new record for condo deals in the area.)\n\u201cThat product doesn\u2019t exist downtown,\u201d said Elliman\u2019s Jade Chan, who leads sales at Michael Shvo\u2019s Mandarin Oriental Residences on Fifth Avenue. \u201cThat part of downtown is in demand always.\u201d\n\nWith an expected sellout close to $2 billion, the building will inject a much-needed swath of new condos into a market, which saw most of its existing inventory scooped up last year as few projects emerged to take their place.\nAgents are betting on 80 Clarkson to bring relief to the dry spell in Manhattan, where high building and land costs caused what Gomes described as a \u201cbottleneck.\u201d Years earlier, developers stopped buying up sites, so instead of a fresh set of new development buildings hitting the market, there\u2019s very little.\nDevelopers have also been leaning toward smaller projects \u2014 a departure from the glitzy Billionaires\u2019 Row supertalls that flooded the city\u2019s new development scene years earlier.\nBoutique buildings like the Reuben Brothers\u2019 Surrey Residences and Aurora Capital Associates\u2019 140 Jane Street, each with fewer than 20 units, have been success stories, while some larger buildings, rife with discounts and languishing units, have served as cautionary tales.\nDespite the trend toward small, few have raised doubts about the size of 80 Clarkson, especially since it\u2019s from the team behind Manhattan\u2019s original buzzworthy building, 15 Central Park West, the tower that redefined condo pricing in the city and set a new standard for ultra-luxury.\nSo far, 80 Clarkson\u2019s developers have been tight-lipped about it, with only a few details making their way into the public eye. The sales team, led by new development marketing veterans Dan Tubb and Amy Williamson, was announced in October.\nSources told\nTRD\nlast month that the duo is likely to quietly begin shopping units in the spring, but no launch date has come out.\nThe building\u2019s planned amenities include a fitness center, pool, spa and hot and cold plunges.",

        "content": "What\u2019s worse: potentially deadly housing or death itself?\nThe answer is eight paragraphs away, but don\u2019t skip ahead.\nOur subject today is the Department of Buildings\u2019 most recent monthly enforcement report, which features the usual rundown of fines given to property owners for unlawfully adding dwellings.\nThe point of these fines is to ensure that people don\u2019t die, especially if a fire erupts. Illegal partitions, bedroom locks and lack of proper egress, for example, can trap residents and impede firefighters.\nIn the Bronx, the agency fined Antonio Collado $120,000 for adding six SRO units to a two-family home at 450 Cyrus Place. Five Boro Storage was dinged $75,000 at 220 East 134 Street, a six-story building authorized for storage, office and lounge use, where inspectors found 16 SROs.\nIvan Vasquez faces $50,000 in penalties at 2798 Pond Place, a two-family converted into a four-family. And Jagdeshwar L. Saadhu is looking at $37,750 for the conversion of 2488 Elm Place, a two-family dwelling, to a five-family with full-height partitions.\nOne incongruity from the report, however, is that these fines for potentially deadly conditions exceeded the penalty at a construction site where someone\nactually did die\n.\nUA Builders was fined just $22,500 at 16 Wade Square after a worker fell from the fifth floor while installing panels. The department found no record of site safety orientation on the day of the fatality, no certified riggers and a knuckle boom operating without approval or inspection.\nMeanwhile, in Brooklyn, the fine was 11 times greater \u2014 $246,250 \u2014 at 286 West End Avenue, where a two-family was illegally converted to a six-family that lacked the required means of egress, automatic sprinklers and fire alarms.\nWhy the discrepancy?\nLocal Law 94\n, passed in 2017,\njacked up the fines\nfor illegal conversions when three or more dwelling units are added to a building. The law compels the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings to issue specific penalties for each illegal unit found and daily penalties until the illegal conditions are corrected.\nThe fine is $15,000 to $25,000 for each illegal unit if there are more than three, plus a $1,000 daily penalty (maxing out at $45,000) until the condition is corrected.\n\nThe law did not accelerate fines for violations on a site where a fatality occurred. In those cases, OATH judges have wider liberties when issuing fines, according to a Department of Buildings spokesperson. (OATH is independent of the agency.) Penalties for construction safety violations can be up to $25,000 each, at OATH\u2019s discretion.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nIf\nNir Meir\npleads guilty or is convicted, will his sentence be any more than the time he\u2019s already served at Rikers Island? Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: When a sensor detects a problem in a building, staff members are more likely to respond if they receive a call from a person than a notification on their phone. Disclaimer: This information comes from a firm that provides monitoring with alerts from humans. But it seems logical.  about the proptech revolution in leak detection\nhere\n.\nElsewhere\u2026\nBank branches are closing again\n, which is bad news for owners of retail real estate because banks are prolific and reliable tenants.\nThis is not the first period of bank branch retrenchment; a previous one occurred because ATMs reduced the need for tellers. But it reversed because banks wanted to intercept customers in person and sell them expensive services, such as money management.\nHowever, the trend is now reversing again, in part because ATMs have been supplemented by digital banking apps.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Tuesday was\n$13 million\nfor a 2,455-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at 220 Central Park South. Deborah Kern of\nthe Corcoran Group\nhad the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$11 million\nfor a 25,420-square-foot warehouse at 1314 59th Street in Borough Park.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$16.9 million\nfor a 7,500-square-foot townhouse at 159 East 61st Street in Lenox Hill. The Deborah Grubman Team at Corcoran has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 68,682-square-foot, 12-story, 99-unit mixed-use project at 205 West 230th Street in Kingsbridge. Kao Hwa Lee Architects filed the permit on behalf of Westbridge Realty Group.

        "content": "The\nInvisible Engine\nis a sadly apt name for REBNY\u2019s annual report on\nreal estate tax revenue\n.\nThe money is indeed invisible to elected officials because, to them, it materializes out of thin air.\nThe Real Estate Board of New York has been issuing this report for years, yet politicians don\u2019t see real estate taxes as a credit to the industry. At best, their attitude is: \u201cPaying those taxes is the least that real estate could do, given how much money it makes.\u201d\nThere are so many things wrong with that thinking.\nTo start, a lot of real estate tax revenue is from property tax, transfer tax and mortgage recording tax \u2014 not income.\nDeals that represent a loss for the seller or a future loss for the buyer pay the same transaction taxes that a profitable deal does. These taxes are just a cost of doing business.\nSimilarly, owners losing money from operating a building might be able to avoid income taxes \u2014 but not property taxes. They can argue for a lower assessment, but, except for nonprofits, property taxes must be paid. (Assembly member Zohran Mamdani and state Sen. John Liu even want\ntwo particular nonprofits\nto pay taxes on their property, simply because they own a lot. Great reasoning!)\n\nMany elected officials like to talk about property owners\u2019 myriad tax breaks. Remember all their\ncriticisms\nof\n421a\n? But you never hear a peep about the taxes that developers do pay or would pay if their projects were approved.\nReal estate-related taxes account for half of locally collected tax revenue and one-third of the city budget. But the City Council treats this as money that magically appears on a revenue forecast.\nEvery year, the Council complains that the mayor is forecasting less tax revenue than will actually come in. Usually, the Council is right \u2014 because the mayor\ndeliberately\nmakes a conservative estimate, knowing the Council always asks for more.\nCouncil members inevitably negotiate for an increase and tout the programs they fund with it. The mayor\u2019s budget office tries to accommodate these additions while keeping the Council from bankrupting the city.\nIt\u2019s especially odd that Council members forecast as much revenue as possible yet\ndiscourage the real estate deals that produce it\n. They\nshrink proposed developments\n, require\nmoney-losing uses\n,\nsteer deals to nonprofits\nthat pay no taxes and effectively\nban hotel projects\n. Most recently, they want to\nhalt new distribution center\ndevelopment.\nNever mind that when nonprofit developers build apartments, they not only get tax breaks but spend more per unit than for-profit ones do. But that\u2019s a story for another day.\n",

        "content": "Sitting in Sant Ambroeus in the West Village, Zeve Salman looked out longingly onto the row of eight-figure homes lining Perry Street.\n\u201cIf you gave me five new houses on this street right here, I could sell them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut find me those five houses.\u201d\nSalman, a co-founder of the Elevated Team with Eric Brown at Compass, echoed a refrain common in 2024, chalking up the market\u2019s troubles to a lack of quality inventory.\nBut Salman and Brown, who this year appear in\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s agent rankings for the first time, found ways to get deals done in a market stifled by high interest rates and political and economic uncertainty.\n\u201cLast year was a challenging year, and it was just a year of sort of confusion and uncertainty,\u201d said Brown Harris Stevens CEO Bess Freedman.\nAs Corcoran\u2019s Kane Manera sees it, that has all shaken out in the form of a pretty efficient market, if not one that is setting price or transaction records.\n\u201cThings from where I stand are efficient,\u201d he said, pointing to the stalemate between buyers and sellers. \u201cIt\u2019s a fairly priced market where buyers and sellers are meeting.\u201d\nAdd to the mix antitrust settlements that shook the industry for much of the past year and changed how agents get paid, and many in the city are already eager to turn the corner to see what 2025 might hold.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unpredictable, and there is volatility,\u201d said Kevelyn Guzman, regional vice president of Coldwell Banker Warburg. But she added that since the start of 2025, \u201cwe\u2019ve seen a shift in a good way. We\u2019ve seen [the market] pick up.\u201d\nHighs and lows\nThe city\u2019s residential market was a rollercoaster last year, alternating high highs with low lows. Transactions lagged in the first half of the year, as high mortgage rates locked sellers into their homes and kept price-conscious buyers on the sidelines.\nBy the summer, all signs pointed to the Federal Reserve finally lowering interest rates. Mortgage rates fell in anticipation, kickstarting deals across the city.\nThough mortgage rates only dropped temporarily, the movement was enough to fuel a string of activity through the fall, a season many in the industry expected to be tempered leading up to the presidential election.\n\u201cIt was kind of like a tale of two markets,\u201d said Douglas Elliman\u2019s Noble Black, whose team ranked in the top 20 in both resale and new development categories.\nBlack described the first half of the year as \u201clackluster,\u201d but by July, \u201ca huge amount of energy\u201d had returned to the market.\nAlong with the sales boom came the return of nine-figure deals in Manhattan, which hadn\u2019t logged a deal of that size in two years.\nFirst, a duplex penthouse at Extell Development\u2019s Central Park Tower closed for $117 million, followed by the crown jewel penthouse at OKO Group\u2019s Aman New York, which sold for $135 million to the building\u2019s developer, Vlad Doronin.\n\u201cThe mood changed,\u201d said Pam Liebman, the CEO of Corcoran Group, which again topped\nTRD\n\u2019s ranking of residential brokerages in Manhattan.\nLiebman added that while the market entered 2024 on uneven footing, it ended the year with a renewed sense of confidence, with the results of a presidential election in the books and strong stock and crypto markets padding the pockets of wealthy buyers.\n\u201cPeople started to realize that there wasn\u2019t going to be an influx of inventory anytime soon,\u201d said Liebman. \u201cThey had to get their lives moving, and it seemed like a pretty good time to buy.\u201d\nBut the year of the market\u2019s return also marked a period of change for residential brokerage.\n\nFollowing the National Association of Realtors\u2019 settlement in 2023, brokerages across the country announced their own deals to satisfy the onslaught of litigation, with firms and trade associations rolling out new rules regulating how brokers do business.\nThe Residential Board of New York kicked off the year by removing buyer agent commission offers from the residential listing service. The organization, which has yet to settle lawsuits filed against it over similar commission-related claims, also started pushing for agents to use buyer agreements \u2014 a move that has been met with a mix of praise, apathy and confusion. (REBNY has since updated its rules to require, not just suggest, the use of buyer agreements.)\nAccess the comprehensive data set supporting this ranking\nhere\n.\nTRD Data\np\nuts the power of real data in your hands.\nThe new dev ebb\nNew development accounts for less than a quarter of the city\u2019s sales, but the industry often looks to the latest crop of building launches as a market bellwether.\nThe only problem? Sponsor launches were few and far between.\nThe buildings that did launch \u2014 projects like the Reuben Brothers\u2019 hotel-condo boutique the Surrey or Mickey Rabina\u2019s 100-unit supertall at 520 Fifth Avenue \u2014 sold fast in the inventory-constrained environment.\nSerhant\u2019s Kayla Lee, who led sales at The Huron, raised prices 13 times at one of Greenpoint\u2019s only new luxury buildings. The building also set the neighborhood price record with a $5.7 million penthouse sale and the neighborhood price per square foot record at unit 7C, which sold for over $2,700 a foot.\nOne of the year\u2019s top-performing buildings, Steve Witkoff\u2019s rebranded One High Line, topped $1 billion in sales and was an example of a languishing property having its moment in the sun with a resurgence of buyers.\nCorcoran\u2019s Deborah Kern and Steve Gold, who topped the new development rankings, have been leading sales there, along with Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group.\n\u201cInventory has been slowly getting absorbed,\u201d said Elliman\u2019s Jade Chan, who is leading sales at the Mandarin Oriental. \u201cOver the past 10 years of new development, we obviously had such a big boom, and now it\u2019s starting to dwindle down.\u201d\nNearly every agent notching new development sales in 2024 talked about developers getting realistic with pricing.\n\u201cThe ones that sell are the ones that get more reasonable and serious about pricing,\u201d said Shlomi Reuveni, who took over sales at 77 Greenwich in 2024 and 25 Broad Street in 2023.\nReuveni and Lee both pointed to not even entertaining projects with aspirational pricing \u2014 something that might have worked 10 years ago, but not in 2024.\n\u201cWe actually walk away from a lot of deals when the seller is very adamant about getting a price that we just don\u2019t think is realistic,\u201d Lee said.\nOutlook for next year\nLooking to the months ahead, brokers and their executives largely projected confidence, though they acknowledged that the wave of new policy from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is adding a layer of uncertainty.\n\u201cThings have been looking really good,\u201d Liebman said. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously nervousness around some of the potential new policies and the little shakiness in the stock market, but according to my agents, the mood is still pretty good out there.\u201d\nBut others were more hesitant. While Elliman\u2019s Eklund-Gomes team\u2019s pre-development business is surging in the new year as developers start to move forward with the early stages of new projects, the team\u2019s co-founder John Gomes said buyers and sellers are surely disoriented by the year\u2019s constant news cycle.\n\u201cWhen you get whiplash, it makes you dizzy. When you get dizzy, you\u2019re unstable,\u201d Gomes said. \u201cThe market is not stable.\u201d\nWith instability at the forefront, Gomes said he doesn\u2019t know where 2025 will fall.\n\u201cI have to say, my crystal ball is foggy, and it\u2019s usually not.\u201d\nAccess the comprehensive data set supporting this ranking\nhere\n.\nTRD Data\np\nuts the power of real data in your hands.",

        "content": "It was a small-time landlord in the city\u2019s forgotten borough who slung the first stone.\nAllen Pilevsky, the owner of a Staten Island strip mall, had spent the bulk of six months working to extend the property\u2019s $14 million mortgage. Under terms set by Signature Bank, the process should have been as complicated as overnighting written notice \u2014 no approval necessary.\nBut he wasn\u2019t dealing with Signature anymore. He was dealing with Rialto Capital Advisors. And the so-called bogeyman of commercial real estate was not playing nice.\nPilevsky claimed in a complaint he notified a stand-in servicer of the extension after Signature failed. But when Rialto stepped in, it ignored the correspondence, instead piling on late fees and default interest.\nIt demanded a pre-negotiation agreement that would have had Pilevsky waive any claims against it and declare himself in default, the suit alleges.\nThe landlord was nearly under Rialto\u2019s thumb. And he wasn\u2019t the only one.\nCitywide, property owners and court records claim Rialto is waging war against Signature borrowers, manufacturing defaults on deals in good standing by ignoring borrowers\u2019 notices to exercise loan extensions and then suing to foreclose.\nRialto contends that it is following the rules and has only enforced its rights and remedies in \u201crare instances\u201d in which sponsors defaulted and refused to communicate. It said it remains committed to borrowers and finding the \u201cbest resolutions possible.\u201d\nThe servicer, one-third of the venture managing Signature\u2019s $17 billion commercial loan book, has lodged at least 88 such actions since March 2024, a few months after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation closed the sale of the debt, according to an analysis of court records.\nNearly half of those pre-foreclosures have been filed this year alone. Insiders familiar with Rialto\u2019s strategy say dozens of other owners are also feeling the heat.\n\u201cIt\u2019s $1.2 billion of loans heavily concentrated in New York,\u201d said an attorney representing Signature borrowers. \u201cHow many of those are in default? Nobody knows.\u201d\nSome, such as Pilevsky, have the means to lawyer up and fight back. But many are even smaller-time players: a retail operator on Long Island, a multifamily landlord in Brooklyn and the owner of a two-story office building are among the borrowers who spoke with The Real Deal.\n\u201cThe rapacious behavior by special servicers is one of the most blatant regulatory gaps that exists in the financial industry.\u201d\nMichael Hanin, Pallas Partners\nThe bulk said they lacked the resources and the know-how to fend off a multi-billion-dollar servicing empire.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to stop them,\u201d the manager of the retail space said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happens next.\u201d\nLegal protections for and regulatory oversight of CRE borrowers is nearly nonexistent \u2014 they\u2019re assumed to be savvy and self-sufficient. Or, as Rialto put it: \u201cWe expect these sophisticated, commercial borrowers to honor the commitments they made.\u201d\nThe FDIC, by design, has been largely hands-off since the sale closed. It declined to comment.\nIn essence: \u201cThere is no one looking out for you,\u201d said Michael Hanin, a commercial litigator at Pallas Partners.\nBut as more borrowers push back, the counteract has raised a crucial question for the industry: Should there be a guardian angel for commercial borrowers, and if so, who can fill the role?\nR\nialto at the ready\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Rialto, a behemoth of special servicing, is allegedly going scorched earth on unwitting borrowers. That\u2019s kind of its thing.\nWhen sponsors default on securitized debt, Rialto\u2019s job is workout talks. It negotiates on the CMBS bondholders\u2019 behalf and its playbook has earned it a bad rap among borrowers who claim it drags out negotiations to rake in as much in fees and default interest as possible.\nSignature sponsors claim Rialto copied and pasted the strategy when it took over their loans.\nPilevsky, who did not return a request for comment, alleged Rialto \u201cacquired the position of servicer\u201d to obtain \u201cdefault interest and management and servicing fees on these loans.\u201d\nJoseph Cayre\u2019s Midtown Equities, which lobbed a class action at Rialto this year, claimed it prolonged talks to \u201cunlawfully manufacture\u201d defaults and \u201ccoerce\u201d borrowers into paying \u201ccrippling default interest and fees.\u201d\nStill, there\u2019s a key distinction between CMBS borrowers and Signature\u2019s clients.\nThe former are typically institutional groups with the deep pockets and legal armies to fight back. Signature, by contrast, was a major lender to the city\u2019s mom-and-pop landlords. A midsize bank with a community feel, it prioritized relationships and tailored, flexible terms.\nTake the loan at the heart of Pilevsky\u2019s and a number of other disputes: a five-year term with a five-year extension that required notice, an income and expense statement and a current rent roll to tap, according to court records.\nIt\u2019s a borrower-friendly product and servicing structure that Signature clients had relaxed into. When Rialto allegedly stopped honoring it, the whiplash was searing.\nN\not in the business\nRialto has replicated the alleged attack plan it first deployed against Pilevsky so many times that it earned a nickname from Midtown Equities\u2019 attorneys in the February class action.\nBrothers Terrence and Darren Oved dubbed it \u201cRialto\u2019s Sinister Pocket Veto Scheme\u201d in a nod to how Rialto ignores borrowers to force defaults.\nThe other common ground, borrowers claim: Their properties are not distressed. Some are market-rate apartments that benefitted from rising rents, others are small suburban office buildings that retained essential services tenants \u2014 bank branches, for example \u2014 through Covid.\nTheir owners thought an extension would be a given.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in pristine condition; it\u2019s the pride of my portfolio,\u201d said the landlord behind the two-story office building. \u201cAnd then, all of a sudden, I get foreclosed upon.\u201d\nApart from frustration, the biggest response among borrowers has been confusion.\nIt\u2019s understood that lenders and loan servicers don\u2019t want to own property. \u201cNot in the business\u201d was a phrase echoed by industry players during interviews. But that\u2019s what foreclosure achieves.\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re beating their chest,\u201d the office owner said.\nF\nollow the profits\nThe end game for Rialto, and its joint venture partners \u2014 Blackstone and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board \u2014 likely isn\u2019t to own assets. It\u2019s to maximize profits.\nThe group scored its stake in the loans at a discount to their book value, according to FDIC documents, creating a sizable window to flip the deals for more.\nA month after the sale, Bloomberg reported the group was working to sell nearly $2 billion in loans. Since, it\u2019s offloaded $700 million to Morgan Stanley and $247 million to Maverick Real Estate partners. Last month, it started shopping another $400 million.\nForeclosure is another path to profits, particularly for performing deals. Take the asset back, sell it for more than what you paid for the mortgage and boom: money in hand. (One caveat to the Signature CRE sale is the leverage the FDIC offered \u2014 the Rialto venture has to pay that back first.)\nIt also works as a negotiating tactic: Corner the borrower into refinancing or selling so it doesn\u2019t need to see through New York\u2019s expensive, time-intensive judicial foreclosure process.\n\nRialto did not weigh in on any grander strategy. Blackstone, a partner in the venture, declined to comment. The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the third group in the JV, did not comment.\nBut a handful of attorneys speculated about the same end game.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way to maximize pressure on the borrowers to come to a resolution,\u201d one lawyer representing Signature borrowers said.\nA\nll-seeing FDIC\nWhen Signature failed and the industry laid blame on its exposure to rent-regulated distress, nonprofits and the city started ringing the FDIC: They did not want a foreclosure tsunami threatening tenant stability.\nThe agency announced it was on board a few months before the sale, underscoring its \u201cstatutory obligation\u201d to preserve the affordability and availability of housing for low- and moderate-income folks.\nIt put its money where its mouth was by holding onto 95 percent of the venture with the debt and selling the remaining 5-percent stake to two non-profits and Related, a seasoned operator of rent-stabilized housing.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to stop them. I don\u2019t know what happens next.\u201d\nmanager of the retail space\nThe city was pleased, and so far the venture has foreclosed on a handful of deals tied to just two borrowers \u2014 a one-time \u201cworst landlord,\u201d and Maverick Real Estate, which took over assets owned by Raphael Toledano, a notorious rent-regulated landlord serving out a ban from New\u00a0 York City real estate.\nFor the CRE debt, the FDIC wasn\u2019t focused on tenants but two other mandates: minimize losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund and maximize returns on failed assets.\nTo achieve both, it went with an 80-20 split. By holding onto the bulk of the debt, the FDIC avoided immediate losses and ensured it could capture any upside. By selling 20 percent of it to Rialto and friends, it guaranteed the venture had skin in the game and an incentive to maximize recoveries.\nThe foreclosure strategy, albeit brutal for borrowers, does achieve this. Pressure forces payoffs and auctions allow it to sell properties.\nThe FDIC declined to comment.\nG\nray area\nA prevailing question among landlords is whether Rialto\u2019s tactics are legal.\nSeveral suits have grazed the allegation. One, filed on investor Israel Weinberger\u2019s behalf over a botched loan extension on a Family Dollar, characterized Rialto\u2019s moves as \u201cpossibly illegal.\u201d\nBut moreso, attorneys say the question is around permissibility. Does Rialto\u2019s behavior run afoul of rules or regulations?\nThere is at least one argument for that.\nThe joint venture structure is governed by a 151-page operating agreement that specifies the group must adhere to the original terms and conditions of the loans inherited from Signature.\nThis would appear to include honoring the extension terms landlords claim Signature baked into their loans: no formal approval necessary or pre-negotiation agreement required, just send notice and you\u2019re good to go.\nBut for a judge to find Rialto\u2019s behavior unlawful, there would need to be a law, regulation or legal precedent in place to check it. And for commercial real estate borrowers, the guardrails were never installed.\nN\naked and afraid\nOn the heels of the Great Recession, residential borrowers won a slew of new protections\u00a0 against the predatory lending and servicing that ran rampant during the period.\nNotably, the Dodd-Frank Act requires servicers to communicate clearly and promptly with borrowers, particularly if their assets are at risk of distress or foreclosure. It also bans servicers from initiating foreclosure proceedings if a modification is underway.\n\u201cThere were a lot of consumer loans \u2014 residential mortgages \u2014 foreclosed upon where you had servicers making false or inaccurate statements to judges,\u201d a former bank examiner with the FDIC recalled of the financial crisis.\nThe agency, when it started selling those mortgages to private investors, also required buyers to follow \u201cappropriate foreclosure practices,\u201d the examiner said.\nIn contrast, commercial borrowers are on their own. And though the big boys of real estate may be shrewd enough to handle themselves against servicers, some smaller operators are as ill-equipped as residential borrowers: they don\u2019t have the money or knowledge to take on Rialto.\n\u201cThe rapacious behavior by special servicers is one of the most blatant regulatory gaps that exists in the financial industry,\u201d Hanin said.\nIf anyone was looking into Rialto\u2019s handling of Signature\u2019s loans, it would be the New York Attorney General, a regulator, such as the New York Department of Financial Services, or electeds.\nRialto is not on Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 radar, according to a spokesperson for her office. The representative said it has not received any whistleblower complaints about the venture\u2019s servicing of Signature\u2019s loans.\nDFS has yet to fulfill a Freedom of Information Law request about any borrower complaints or investigations into the Rialto venture.\nTRD\nhas been unable to independently verify if any electeds have been tipped off.\nIt\u2019s unlikely anyone cares.\nB\nad rap\nFor Signature borrowers in Rialto\u2019s crosshairs, their sole defense may be the courts.\nThe servicer has agreed to settle three cases lodged by Signature borrowers against the servicer, court records show and sources corroborate.\nIn one, it agreed to a discounted payoff of the loan, according to public records.\nThe terms of the two other settlements are unclear.\nThose familiar with the suits say the servicer may be sensitive to the public attention such cases draw. The FDIC would also have reason to be.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a government agency so it cares about its reputation with the public; it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d the bank examiner said. \u201cThe FDIC prefers not to have that publicity.\u201d\nStill, neither countersuing nor pushing back is a sure defense.\nAn attorney representing multiple Signature sponsors said the firm has dug in its heels, in one example refusing to work something out on a deal valued at less than $1 million.\nOn the Fulton Street loan, the venture filed to foreclose after the sponsor sued, alleging the \u201cpossibly illegal attempt\u201d to manufacture a default.\nIt is possible that a borrower\u2019s winning case could establish some precedent. That is: offer protection in the courts.\nBut this would require a sponsor to take one for the team and slog through the expense and time of a lawsuit that would likely dwarf the benefits to the borrower, one attorney said.\nSo the question remains: Will a David emerge to face off against Rialto\u2019s Goliath?",

But only a few have the right combination of magnetism, potential for success and likelihood of being completed in a timely manner.\nAt the top of the heap is\nShore Club Private Collection\n, an Auberge-branded project under construction in Miami Beach.\nWitkoff\n, led by Alex Witkoff, and Ted Koenig\u2019s Monroe Capital are developing the 49-unit condo and 75-key hotel on the strip developers are now calling \u201cbillionaires\u2019 beach.\u201d\nShore Club is a combination of a restored circa-1939 building and a new 20-story tower. There\u2019s also a 6,000-square-foot single-family beach house. Robert A.M. Stern Architects designed everything. Condos will range from 1,900 square feet to more than 10,000 square feet.\nThe development is 90 percent presold, and construction is moving.\nThat\u2019s much further along than the nearby competition, which includes the Rosewood-branded Raleigh redevelopment.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Fredrik Eklund, who is on the sales team, said he wanted to buy into a project developed by Witkoff and designed by RAMSA.\nHe was one of the first buyers to sign a contract.\n\n\u201cThere were no renderings, marketing or floorplan yet,\u201d he said. \u201cI bought it sight unseen.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just really the best floorplans I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he added. \u201cSize is right, and lastly, it\u2019s 3 acres. It\u2019s a very large compound with all that greenery, and the amenities are insane.\u201d\nPicture what sold him: Botanical gardens that connect throughout the property, a library and cocktail lounge, Auberge-operated restaurants and a fitness center with private training suites, spa and pools.\nMysterious, record-breaking sales always boost a project\u2019s allure, and Shore Club has them. A hidden buyer is under contract to pay more than $11,000 per square foot, a total purchase price of $120 million, for the penthouse. That would blow the existing price-per-foot record in Miami out of the water, nearly doubling it.\nA separate deal, in the $70 million range, is also in the works to a Middle Eastern buyer, sources told\nTRD\n.\nLike Miami\u2019s \u201cit\u201d buildings of the past, such as Alan Faena and Len Blavatnik\u2019s Faena House, most of the current top properties have fewer units, waterfront views and pricing at the very top end of the market. Shore Club has several close contenders.\nOn Fisher Island, a wealthy enclave that\u2019s only accessible by boat or helicopter, the Related Group and its partners are building a 10-story, 50-unit building called the Residences at Six Fisher Island. When the developers launched sales in 2022, asking prices averaged $30 million and penthouses started at double that. The project is pricey, exclusive and will set records once completed, but it\u2019s less buzzy.\nProperty Markets Group and its partners\u2019\nWaldorf Astoria Residences\nMiami at 300 Biscayne Boulevard is Miami\u2019s first supertall, at 1,049 feet. Designed by Carlos Ott with Sieger Suarez Architects to appear like a stack of glass cubes, it\u2019s another honorable mention \u201cit\u201d building \u2014 though it\u2019ll be much denser than the Shore Club, with 387 condos and 205 hotel rooms.\nLast year, its developers secured $668 million in construction financing, the largest condo construction loan in Florida. The Waldorf is more than 90 percent sold.\nThe Shore Club\u2019s competition also includes Michael Shvo\u2019s Raleigh project a few blocks south on Collins Avenue. Shvo and Deutsche Finance are redeveloping three hotels into a Rosewood Hotels &amp; Resorts-branded 44-unit condo and 60-key hotel, designed by Peter Marino. When Shvo launched sales, the firm took a very hush-hush approach. Pricing was private and visits to the sales center were invitation-only. That strategy \u2014 which has worked for other developers \u2014 backfired for Shvo, and\nsales suffered\n.",

        "content": "Ask a toddler to draw picture of a beach, and it would probably look like the one in Fort Lauderdale. The sand is white and the water is blue. The palm trees offer sparse shade.\nOn a March day, spring breakers sprawl across the sand. They\u2019re young and sunburned, and they flock to the strip lined with spring break spots: the Elbow Room, Se\u00f1or Frog\u2019s and the Drunken Taco. Locals are probably on the water. There are 100 marinas and 50,000 yachts registered in Fort Lauderdale, a city of 184,000 people.\nNine miles up Route A1A, families prefer the pier in Pompano Beach. They lounge on the beach and get lunch at spots such as Burgerfi and Lucky Fish. The landscaping is lush and the energy is mellow. It\u2019s nothing fancy, but it\u2019s nice. But change is coming. The signs are there, advertising sales galleries for luxury condos with such brands as the Ritz-Carlton, Armani and Waldorf Astoria.\nInland, in the rural enclave Southwest Ranches, Gisele B\u00fcndchen picked up a $9 million dollar equestrian estate. Soccer megastar Lionel Messi brought the global spotlight in 2023, when he bought an $11 million waterfront mansion in Fort Lauderdale\u2019s gated Bay Colony neighborhood as part of his move to Inter Miami.\nThat Broward County could be home to two of the most famous people in the world would have been unthinkable five years ago.\nStraddled by Miami-Dade County to the south and Palm Beach County to the north, Broward is South Florida\u2019s forgotten middle child, for decades upstaged by its more expensive, higher-profile neighbors.\n\u201cFort Lauderdale, the lifestyle is a little more at ease,\u201d Related Group\u2019s\nNick P\u00e9rez\nsaid. Related, with\nMerrimac Ventures\n, is behind the Waldorf.\nBut Broward\u2019s moment has finally arrived. There are over 3,900 condo units across more than two dozen projects in development, according to an\nanalysis by\nThe Real Deal\n,\nand they\u2019re being built by the region\u2019s big names: Related\u2019s P\u00e9rez family, Isaac Toledano\u2019s BH Group, Miki Naftali\u2019s Naftali Group and Edgardo Defortuna\u2019s Fortune International Group \u2014 which, with Oak Capital, is behind the Ritz-Carlton \u2014 all have projects here. Even\nthe Rabsky Group\n, known for redeveloping Brooklyn, has approvals to build three towers in Fort Lauderdale. Related in particular is betting big on Broward, with seven condo projects stretching from Hollywood to Hillsboro Beach.\nBrickell and West Palm Beach are buzzier, better-known centers of South Florida\u2019s real estate boom, but Fort Lauderdale and Pompano Beach have caught the attention of developers, who pitch the county as a more affordable, relaxed alternative to Miami-Dade for local and out-of-state buyers alike. There\u2019s room to grow, especially with hospitality brands that can elevate the area with luxury buyers.\nThe shift goes beyond the luxury new development market. For decades, even Broward\u2019s most upscale neighborhoods have lagged in pricing compared to their Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counterparts. While deals over $50 million take place on a semi-regular basis in those other markets, Broward has seen only one deal at the trophy price point: financier Donald Sussman\u2019s record\n$70 million sale\nlast September. Before that, Broward\u2019s record was a\n$40 million deal\nin 2023, and before that, it was\na $32.5 million deal\nin 2022. The price records in Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties, meanwhile, both top $100 million.\nWith the herd of South Florida developers moving to Broward, billions of dollars are on the line, dependent upon thousands of units selling to luxury buyers, many of whom could afford to buy in Miami or West Palm Beach. So much development and wealth could change a place known for its mass market appeal and party spots.\nA\npples and oranges\nDevelopers and agents say Broward\u2019s growth wouldn\u2019t be possible without the pandemic catalyzing the market \u2014 and saturating Miami\u2019s. Many of Broward\u2019s buyers are Miami price refugees, fleeing the global megawealth warping the city\u2019s cost of living.\n\u201cPeople who are looking for second homes or to invest in real estate also have budgets,\u201d P\u00e9rez said. \u201cAs people get priced out of Miami, they\u2019re looking at other options.\u201d\nMost of the buyers come from the Northeast, the Midwest and California, brokers and developers say. The biggest difference for developers, who are accustomed to building and selling in Miami, is the lack of Latin American buyers.\nBroward\u2019s biggest international demographic is\nCanadian second-home owners\n, as made evident by all the Quebec license plates parked along Pompano Beach.\nAgents said that selling these projects to mostly domestic buyers is different. The buyers are willing to spend more, but they\u2019re accustomed to mortgages and can be uncomfortable with deposit structures.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t replace beach. It\u2019s our best asset.\u201d\nNick P\u00e9rez of Related Group, admitting that Fort Lauderdale\u2019s beach might be better than Miami\u2019s\n\u201cEverything is different, the buyer pool, the process,\u201d Ryan Shear, a principal with PMG, said.\nLand here is cheaper, and the playing field for projects isn\u2019t as crowded. In Miami-Dade, developers can struggle to find sites at prices that make a project feasible, he said.\n\n\u201cYou can still find empty lots in Broward,\u201d said Fernando de Nu\u00f1ez y Lugones, CEO of Vertical Developments, which along with its partners is planning the 28-unit\nArmani/Casa Residences Pompano Beach\nand the 36-unit\nRiva Residenze\ncondos in Fort Lauderdale.\nPrices for those lots are cheaper than equivalent sites in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties. Vertical and its partners paid just $8 million for the 0.8-acre Riva Residenze in 2022. In 2020, Fortune International Group and Oak Capital paid $27.5 million for the 4.6-acre oceanfront site for the planned\nRitz-Carlton Residences, Pompano Beach\n.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t replace beach. It\u2019s our best asset,\u201d said P\u00e9rez, who conceded that the beaches in Fort Lauderdale and Pompano Beach are even better than many of Miami\u2019s.\n\u201cWhen you look at Fort Lauderdale, it\u2019s not like Miami,\u201d Naftali, who is planning the 45-story, 370-unit Viceroy Residences Fort Lauderdale, said. \u201cIt has a lot to offer and compete with major cities around the world.\u201d\nBut why does everyone suddenly want to build a condo tower here? Broward has for so long been derided as the source of\nso many only-in-Florida scandals\n: Bribery, incompetence and dysfunction are repeated themes.\n\u201cI wish I could give you an intelligent answer to that,\u201d Shear said. \u201cTo be honest, I didn\u2019t know Fort Lauderdale or Broward that well five, 10 years ago.\u201d\nHe\u2019s now planning the 28-story, 44-unit\nSage Intracoastal Residences Fort Lauderdale\n, an idea Shear says he got from watching his fellow developers.\n\u201cWe saw other developers be successful selling condos,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we wanted to join the party.\u201d\nH\now it started\nThe party was largely started by the P\u00e9rezes and Defortuna, who were partners in the\nAuberge Beach Residences &amp; Spa Fort Lauderdale\n, a 171-unit oceanfront project that set price records for Broward when it was completed in early 2019. The success of the Auberge was followed by Fort Partners and Merrimac Ventures\u2019\nFour Seasons Residences Fort Lauderdale\n, an oceanfront complex with 83 condos and 148 hotel rooms that sold out for an estimated $350 million.\nThe Auberge and Four Seasons are just north of the planned St. Regis Resort and Residences, Bahia Mar Fort Lauderdale, a redevelopment of 40 oceanfront acres and the current site of the Bahia Mar Yachting Center, which hosts the Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show each year.\nThe project has been in the works for more than a decade, stalled by disagreements between the city, the boat show and the developers, Jimmy Tate and Sergio Rok, who eventually brought in Related as a partner on the resort.\nThe first phase of the St. Regis Bahia Mar will cost an estimated $2 billion. It includes two 23-story condo towers, a 197-key luxury hotel and a private beach club. Douglas Elliman\u2019s Daniel Teixeira, who is leading sales at the project, described his buyers as affluent individuals looking for \u201ca marina lifestyle.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you think of Fort Lauderdale, you\u2019re no longer going to think of spring break,\u201d P\u00e9rez said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to think of a world-class yachting destination.\u201d\nThe city is looking to align itself with loftier figures than drunk, sun-starved college kids. In 2022, Fort Lauderdale invited Prince Albert II and Princess Charlene of Monaco to attend the grand opening of the city\u2019s aquatic center \u2014 and they came. Their January 2023 visit was part of a broader effort to build a relationship between the two yachting hubs.\nBut a luxury shift requires more than a royal friendship, and Fort Lauderdale is not yet a peer to Monaco. Even if all these developers pull off their projects, success could pose tough questions for local leaders who already need to solve the problems of crippling traffic and an affordability crisis.\n\u201cReal estate is like a nuclear bomb,\u201d de Nu\u00f1ez y Lugones said, moving his hands to mimic a blast radius. He sees the development process unfolding as \u201ca mega gentrification\u201d of the region.\n\u201cThe local people who have been here are pushed to the west,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to have the wealthiest people in the world having a first or second home towards the water.\u201d\nThat\u2019s if everything goes to plan. And developers say they\u2019re not there yet.\n\u201cWhat is missing here is quality,\u201d Naftali said bluntly. \u201cWhen you start to see demand for true quality, you see customers that are asking for great restaurants, really quality condominium buildings and quality of lifestyle \u2014 that\u2019s changing the city.\u201d",

        "content": "If Abraham Lincoln had the Homestead Act \u2014 the 1862 measure that gave 160 acres of public land to almost any American who agreed to steward it \u2014 Miami-Dade County has the Homestead Town Center.\nIn a neighborhood where development sites sell for $1 million an acre, the 24-acre Homestead Town Center went for just $12.4 million in a no-bid deal in which the county shed so-called surplus land. The new owners are a pair of would-be developers planning an entertainment venue with restaurants inside refurbished cargo containers.\nTheirs is just one of three recent surplus deals since 2023, and by far the most expensive. The other two cost their developers nothing at all, just like Lincoln\u2019s plots. In all three, favored groups seemed to take control of properties without competition and without much scrutiny. In exchange, the no-bid winners are promising to build hundreds of affordable and workforce housing units or generate hundreds of jobs.\nCounty commissioners authorized the Homestead sale, ignoring warnings from the Miami-Dade Inspector General that county staff had failed to obtain independent appraisals on the value of the land.\nThe watchdog also determined that the new owners, Ahmand Johnson and Jossua Parini, had been less than forthcoming about how they plan to finance their project and who their financial backers are.\nThese no-bid surplus land deals are made possible thanks to a county administrative order approved by the county commission in 2022 that authorizes any Miami-Dade official to back a developer\u2019s proposal for underutilized government properties, according to an affordable housing builder who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nThe Real Deal\nagreed to conceal the developer\u2019s identity because their firm is currently building affordable housing projects for Miami-Dade County and vying for other development agreements.\n\u201cPeople are going straight to the commissioners and cutting these types of deals,\u201d the developer said. \u201cThere is no advertisement for selling the land and there is no competitive process. You only hear about them once they are placed on a county commission agenda. By then, the deals have already been cooked.\u201d\nThe county commission appears to be circumventing Miami-Dade and state law requiring competitive bidding for government contracts, Robert Jarvis, a Nova Southeastern University ethics law professor, told\nThe Real Deal\n.\n\u201cIt sounds illegal,\u201d Jarvis said. \u201cIt could be that these projects make the most money for the county or provide the most benefit for residents, but when you don\u2019t have a competitive process, the county doesn\u2019t know if it is getting the best possible deal.\u201d\nHundreds of pages of county documents and video recordings of county commission meetings for the three deals analyzed by\nTRD\nshow how the agreements sailed through even when a handful of elected officials raised concerns about the planned projects.\nH\nomestead Town Center\nBy all accounts, the new owners of Homestead Town Center, the first of the three deals, are not developers. Johnson is a Miami-based sports and entertainment lawyer who handles contractual and transactional matters for professional athletes and musicians. Parini is an events producer and party promoter, also based in Miami.\nDespite having zero experience in building construction, the duo snagged approval and negotiated a bargain price in 2023 by wooing elected officials with the pitch that their containerized entertainment park, which also included a mini-golf course, a covered amphitheater, a dog park and playgrounds, would generate hundreds of new jobs.\nJohnson\u2019s and Parini\u2019s Homestead Town Center proposal received the most scrutiny of the three deals, yet county commissioners still approved it by an overwhelming majority with a vote of 7-1. Commissioner Danielle Cohen Higgins voted against the deal after grilling Homestead Town Center\u2019s lobbyist, Miami-based government affairs lawyer Albert Dotson, about his clients\u2019 credibility, video of the July 6, 2023 county commission shows.\nCounty Commissioner Kionne McGhee, who represents the district where the 24 acres are located near a U.S. Air Force base, advocated for the deal, which hinged on Homestead Town Center\u2019s principals showing they had the financial capacity to develop the park. The project would cost an estimated $18.7 million to build, county documents state.\n\u201cYou only hear about [the deals] once they are placed on a county commission agenda. By then, the deals have already been cooked.\u201d\nMiami-Dade developer\nMcGhee did not respond to multiple text messages and emails to his spokesperson requesting comment. Johnson initially told\nTRD\nthat he would only respond to questions in writing. He did not respond to follow-up requests for comment after\nTRD\nemailed him a list of questions. Dotson, Homestead Town Center\u2019s lobbyist, declined comment.\nBefore the vote, then-Miami-Dade Inspector General Felix Jimenez provided county commissioners with a recap of his office\u2019s audit of the proposed contract. Johnson and Parini had agreed to a stipulation that they would not seek to build multifamily units on the site for a period of 15 years, yet they were relying on a $16 million equity investment from Montvale, New Jersey-based Cider Moon Investment Group, to cover the $12.4 million purchase, Jimenez\u2019s report noted. Cider Moon, which would end up owning 50 percent of Homestead Town Center, focuses on apartment projects.\nJimenez also pointed out that Homestead Town Center\u2019s initial proposal stated that the container park would operate at a loss without an apartment component. The ownership structure of the Homestead Town Center entity managed by Johnson and Parini was also shrouded in mystery, the inspector general found. What\u2019s more, Jimenez criticized county staff for only relying on the Miami-Dade property appraiser\u2019s valuation of the 24 acres to determine the $12.4 million sale price. Appraisals that valued the land based on what could be developed on the property would have been useful to obtain, the report said.\nIn response to Commissioner Cohen Higgins\u2019 inquiries about Jimenez\u2019s findings, Homestead Town Center lobbyist Dotson insisted Johnson and Parini were the sole decision makers, and that Cider Moon was merely a limited partner. He also boasted that the project would be successful without including apartments.\n\u201cWe absolutely believe that it is viable,\u201d Dotson said, according to the video. \u201c[Cider Moon] knows exactly what the restrictions are. They have submitted a letter of intent to invest in this project as it is presented today.\u201d\nYet a year later, on July 2, the county commission voted 12-0 to amend the purchase agreement and allow Homestead Town Center\u2019s principals to explore adding workforce and affordable housing to the project, meeting minutes show. Johnson and Parini also got a five month extension on their due diligence period, which expired in November. They still have not closed on the site.\nThat may be because Johnson and Parini didn\u2019t end up partnering with Cider Moon. Chris Mooney, Cider Moon\u2019s managing partner, recently told\nTRD\nvia email that his firm was never a partner in Homestead Town Center: \u201cIt was just a proposal, but it ended up not working out and [we] never actually got involved in the project.\u201d\n\nT\nerra\u2019s South Dade\nm\nultifamily project\nCohen Higgins played an integral role in backing a no-bid surplus land deal in her district with Terra, the Coconut Grove-based development firm led by David Martin. In 2023, Terra submitted an unsolicited proposal to Cohen Higgins\u2019 office to build a 500-unit workforce housing project on 10.6 acres of county-owned surface parking lots near the South Dade Government Center in Cutler Bay.\nInstead of seeking competitive bids, Cohen Higgins\u2019 office and the Miami-Dade Internal Services Department began the process of determining if the parking lots could be deemed surplus land, county documents show. While 7.2 acres could be used for redevelopment, the remaining 3.4 acres could not be made available because the county uses that portion to store equipment.\nRoughly a year later, the county and Terra agreed to enter into a lease. The developer would get the 7.2 acres for 99 years to build a 352-unit workforce housing project, with an option to build another 322 affordable housing units on the remaining acreage if Miami-Dade stopped using the land within five years, county records show. An independent appraisal by the county valued the entire 10.6 acres at $15 million, but Terra would not be required to pay for the land for a while.\nInstead, Terra agreed to pay the county up to $227 million in rent over the life of the 99-year lease if the developer builds all 674 apartments. The firm also agreed to make an initial rent payment of $5.7 million within 60 days of Terra obtaining construction financing, a draft of the lease shows. Once the 352-unit first phase is completed, Terra would make an annual rent payment to the county of $122,500 and subsequent annual payments would grow by three percent every year.\nTerra\u2019s proposal shows that a project with at least 500 units would generate an estimated $3.2 million in annual net operating income the first year that tenants move in. The net operating income grows to $9.8 million by the sixth year.\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t have a competitive process, the county doesn\u2019t know if it is getting the best possible deal.\u201d\nRobert Jarvis, ethics law professor\nThrough a spokesperson, Terra\u2019s Martin declined to comment about the proposal.\nCounty memos initially showed Miami-Dade would receive $27 million over the 99-year term if only the first project got built, and another $71 million in rental income should the second development move forward. But by the time the lease agreement was placed on a county commission committee agenda on Sept. 4 of last year, the rent projections had grown by $129 million over the life of the 99-year lease, county documents show.\nHowever, county staff, Cohen Higgins\u2019 office and Terra did not provide an explanation for the disparity between the initial proposal and the final version. During the September committee hearing County Commissioner Eileen Higgins, whose district includes downtown Miami and Brickell, two of the hottest neighborhoods for development in Miami-Dade, criticized Terra\u2019s proposed annual lease payments as \u201coutrageously low.\u201d\n\u201cI think this is a fantastic project on a fantastic piece of land, but I am not convinced the money we should receive is relative to deals done on much smaller pieces of land,\u201d Higgins said, suggesting Terra set aside more units for affordable housing.\nAnother county commissioner, Ren\u00e9 Garcia, also had a problem with the lack of affordable housing units when Terra\u2019s lease agreement came before the full county commission for approval a month later on Oct. 1. \u201cI think moving forward we should have more of an affordable housing component,\u201d Garcia said at the meeting. \u201cI don\u2019t want to break the deal here, but I think we can get a little more for our community when we look at these types of projects.\u201d\nTo appease her colleagues, Cohen Higgins and Terra agreed to reserve 10 percent of the apartments for low-income residents. The county commission voted 10-1 to approve the Terra lease agreement.\nIn an emailed statement to\nTRD\n, Cohen Higgins defended the no-bid deal by noting housing affordability in Miami-Dade is at \u201ccrisis levels\u201d and a \u201ctop concern\u201d for Miami-Dade residents. \u201cThe benefits you ask?\u201d the statement said. \u201cTransforming a parking lot used for Covid testing into affordable homes for families while creating a new revenue stream for the county.\u201d\nM\niami River project\nThe third no-bid surplus land deal involves Miami-Dade County giving away a half-acre lot on the Miami River for free to Goldstein Kite Environmental, a Vero Beach-based firm that focuses on cleaning up contaminated sites and flipping the land for development. The Miami River is one of the hottest neighborhoods for waterfront development in South Florida. Planned projects on tap include Faena Residences, a 440-unit condominium by developer Alan Faena, Fortune International Group and KAR Properties, and One Brickell Riverfront, a three-tower condo complex by Two Roads Development and Newgard Development Group.\nGoldstein Kite Environmental submitted a proposal to build an eight-story project with 104 affordable and workforce housing units to County Commissioner Marleine Bastien\u2019s office in 2023, shortly after the firm paid $4.5 million for 2 acres that abuts the county-owned half acre at 2750 Northwest 20th Street. The properties are in Bastien\u2019s district.\nIn exchange for paying nothing for the land, Goldstein Kite Environmental would reserve 10 percent of the planned project\u2019s apartments for \u201cextreme low-income\u201d renters, and another 15 percent of the units for tenants who earn between 60 percent and 100 percent of the county\u2019s area median income, which is $79,400 annually, county records show. Another 25 percent of the units would be designated workforce housing. The remainder of the apartments would be market rate. Goldstein Kite Environmental would be responsible for obtaining government grants to clean up its 2 acres and the county\u2019s half-acre lot so the vacant assemblage can be redeveloped.\nBastien and Michael Goldstein, an environmental lawyer who is Goldstein Kite\u2019s CEO, did not respond to phone messages seeking comment and emails with questions about the no-bid deal.\nYet, it appears Goldstein Kite Environmental has zero experience in residential development. Projects listed on the firm\u2019s website shows that Goldstein Kite Environmental conducted soil removal and clean-up duties on a 17-acre site in North Miami Beach on behalf of a property owner who bought the land for $2.2 million in 2012. The site, after it was cleaned up and rezoned for residential use, was sold two years later for $17 million. In 2022, Goldstein Kite Environmental cleaned up another development site and got the property rezoned for a mixed-use project with up to 300 apartments in Miami. The firm then sold the site to multifamily developer the Richman Group.\nDespite Goldstein Kite Environmental\u2019s lack of experience actually developing buildings, Bastien pushed hard for the firm at the county commission\u2019s meeting on Sept. 9 of last year. \u201cThe housing crisis demands our immediate attention,\u201d Bastien told her colleagues. \u201cThis project has been in the works for over a year and letting it slip away would be a missed opportunity.\u201d\nThe county commission voted 12-1 to approve the no-bid deal.\nTypically, no-bid government deals are justifiable if they\u2019re meant to address a true emergency, like clearing debris after a hurricane, or if a firm is the only vendor that can provide a particular service or product to a governmental agency, Nova Southeastern\u2019s Jarvis said.\n\u201cThere may be an affordable housing crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is not an emergency. It could be a case of \u2018thank God someone is taking this property off our hands and it is not just sitting there unused.\u2019 But a bidding process is designed to uncover if someone else can come in and give you a better deal.\u201d",

Terms of the deals were not disclosed.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t on my bingo card this year to be doing school leases, but here I am \u2014 and you roll with the times,\u201d Alex Cameron, Los Angeles regional director at Boston-based developer BXP, told the Times. The company houses Village School and Seven Arrows Elementary School in two of its Santa Monica buildings.\nCameron said his company\u2019s offices at the Colorado Center and Santa Monica Business Park have few vacancies, unlike some other landlords. It took creativity to squeeze in the new school tenants.\n\u201cIt could best be described as a collective triumph,\u201d John Evans, head of Village School, which relocated its 250 students to Colorado Center, told the Times. The new K-6 digs don\u2019t have permanent walls, requiring temporary dividers.\nHe said other tenants at Colorado Center, including Hulu and Roku, have offered to help.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re [asking], \u2018What can we do for your graduation? Would the kids like to have a career day over here?\u2019\u201d Evans told the newspaper. \u201cIt\u2019s just been overwhelming.\u201d\nBut not every landlord in Santa Monica\u2019s 8.4-million-square-foot office market has been as fortunate. The office vacancy in the fourth quarter was 31 percent, up from 25 percent a year earlier, according to JLL.\nOne gaping hole is the vacant\nformer Sears building\nnear the Third Street Promenade. But it\u2019ll soon be packed with nearly 2,500 teens, as Palisades Charter High School is slated to reopen there this month.\nThe building\u2019s owners, New York-based Seritage Growth Properties and Atlanta-based Invesco Real Estate, which poured $50 million into mixed-use upgrades since the 100,000-square-foot Sears closed in 2017, had been unable to find a tenant since the pandemic.\nEnter Pali High, whose Pacific Palisades campus was 30 percent damaged or destroyed in the January fire.\nThe high school signed a six-month lease for the former Sears building, renamed Mark 302, at 302 Colorado Avenue. The price, including construction: $11 million, the bulk of it coming from the school\u2019s insurance, Pamela Magee, Pali High\u2019s principal, told the Times.\nEric Dinenberg, chief operating officer for Seritage, said the company \u201cappreciates being part of the fire recovery effort,\u201d adding that the former Sears property is an \u201carchitectural gem,\u201d whose updates \u201cshowcase its flexibility.\u201d\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

The financing allows Hudson to pay off a $168 million loan tied to the Sawtelle property.\nThe remaining funds will be used to repay outstanding debt on the REIT\u2019s unsecured revolving credit facility and for \u201cother general corporate purposes.\u201d\n\u201cThis financing provides us with nearly half a billion dollars of gross proceeds to fully repay our Element LA secured loan and outstanding amounts on our credit facility,\u201d Harout Diramerian, chief financial officer for Hudson Pacific, said in a statement.\n\nThe Riot Games lease, signed in 2015 for 15 years, may be tenuous. Early last year, the company laid off 530 workers, 11 percent of its workforce, after toxic workplace environment\nallegations and lawsuits\n, including accusations of sexual harassment and discrimination.\nElsewhere, the REIT is struggling to come to terms with declining office and Hollywood studio occupancy.\nIn February, Hudson Pacific announced it would sell four office buildings for up to\n$150 million\nwhile facing hundreds of millions in financial losses from low-performing office and studio properties.\nThe developer manages more than 2 million square feet of soundstages, and is a favorite landlord of Netflix, which fully leases its 13-story Epic office tower in Hollywood.\nBut the REIT has faced headwinds in the years since the pandemic and the Hollywood labor strikes that largely shut down the industry in 2023, according to CO. Its\nstock price has plunged 92 percent\nsince its pre-pandemic peak, and it recently canceled plans for a new studio project near London.\nThe company\u2019s net loss in the fourth quarter was\n$169.9 million\n, compared to a $97.9 million loss a year earlier. Hudson lost more than $364 million in 2024, compared to a $192.1 loss in 2023.

Still, the ultra-luxury resort brand\u2019s choice to be part of a landmark Beverly Hills development will be the market\u2019s greatest test of vertical living in a city known more for its single-family homes than condo life.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very exciting project architecturally. The amenities are really cool, and it will definitely be the No. 1 most luxurious project in all of Los Angeles,\u201d the Agency CEO and co-founder Mauricio Umansky said.\nAman Beverly Hills consists of a 78-unit Aman hotel and two residential towers, one 28 stories and the other 31, with views of the Los Angeles Country Club and the development\u2019s gardens. Life at the residences comes with membership to the exclusive Aman Club where wellness and dining are among the amenities.\nThe residences and hotel are part of One Beverly Hills, the 17.5-acre mixed-use project being developed by Cain International and OKO Group. It\u2019s backed by more than $2 billion in financing, with Lord Norman Foster\u2019s Foster + Partners behind the project\u2019s master plan. When completed in the final quarter of 2027, One Beverly Hills will include 10 acres of botanical gardens, the Beverly Hilton and Waldorf Astoria.\nNeither Umansky nor any other agent in the market is representing Aman, with the resort company handling sales in-house, further adding to the project\u2019s mystique.\nAman said through a spokesperson that more than half of the first residential tower, which currently has 69 residences being marketed for sale, is under contract and going for \u201crecord-breaking prices per square foot\u201d for Los Angeles. The individual declined to share pricing or square footage for the condos.\nThe lack of information leaves room for debate about Aman\u2019s it factor.\n\n\u201cThe significance [of the Aman Residences] will have a lot to do with when we see the sellout or acceptance of the pricing and people actually moving in there,\u201d Umansky said.\nIn a region that has not historically been a condo market, where developers have a tendency to overestimate their absorption rates and sellouts, demand has increased for high-rise living since the Palisades and Eaton fires, Umansky noted.\nTomer Fridman of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California said he\u2019s had some clients express interest in the Aman Residences. As with other branded residential projects, those already familiar with the brand might have enough loyalty to reduce their hesitation about high rises.\n\u201cThis is the first time in L.A. history where people have a big appetite for vertical living,\u201d Fridman said.\nFridman, along with team member Amir Ensani and Compass\u2019 Sally Forster Jones, were behind last year\u2019s top condo sale in the city of Los Angeles at Emaar North America\u2019s Beverly West. The trio sold the top-floor penthouse in the luxury high-rise at 1200 Club View Drive for $23.5 million.\nFridman and Forster Jones also represent the Rosewood Residences in Beverly Hills. He estimated, based on what he\u2019s sold, units in the ultra-luxury segment currently average between $3,000 and $5,000 per square foot.\nUmansky thinks lower: a range of $2,300 to $2,400 per square foot.\nIn other words, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess as to what Aman residences may be in contract for.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important is it\u2019s not a price-per-square-foot play,\u201d Fridman said. \u201cIt\u2019s an amenities and lifestyle play.\u201d\nBuyers are attracted to full-service buildings, where there\u2019s everything from security to suggestions on preferred vendors for dog walking.\n\u201cIf you build it, they will come,\u201d Fridman said. \u201cBut it has to be very, very bespoke.\u201d",

        "content": "Angela Aman hadn\u2019t even lived in her new house for a year when the wildfires broke out in Los Angeles.\nThe Kilroy Realty CEO\u2019s nanny was the only one home when word came to evacuate, and she managed to retrieve the family dog, Aman\u2019s children\u2019s passports and a few outfits for the family. It wasn\u2019t long though before Aman\u2019s Palisades home was gone.\nThat was the second major disaster Aman had faced close up.\nFresh out of Wharton at the University of Pennsylvania, with a B.S. in economics, Aman started working for Deutsche Bank across from the World Trade Center only a few months before the 9/11 attacks.\nAman didn\u2019t want to dwell on either tragedy during a recent sit-down interview in Kilroy\u2019s headquarters, on the second floor of an office building the publicly traded real estate investment trust owns in West Los Angeles.\nBefore starting at Kilroy in January 2024, Aman worked at Brixmor Property Group in New York City. The South Dakota native was hired as CFO of the retail center REIT in May 2016 and also became its president in September 2023.\nAt Kilroy, founded in 1947, Aman oversees ownership of 120 office buildings spanning roughly 17 million square feet primarily on the West Coast, with 6.2 million square feet of it in the San Francisco Bay area and 4.3 million square feet of it in Los Angeles.\nIts L.A. holdings total 12 office buildings in Hollywood, West Los Angeles, Culver City and Long Beach \u2014 including Westside Media Center, Tribeca West, Aero and Blackwelder, Columbia Square, On Vine and Sunset Media Center.\nKilroy\u2019s portfolio also comprises life sciences properties in San Francisco and San Diego, 1,000 apartment units and 64 acres of undeveloped land.\nAmong its big projects, Kilroy opened the second phase of its 3 million-square-foot Kilroy Oyster Point life sciences campus in South San Francisco in February. Kilroy reportedly recently\nsettled a legal battle\nwith neighboring property owners over control of a downtown San Francisco alleyway. The property gives the REIT an access point into its redevelopment of the Flower Mart into a roughly 2.3-million-square-foot office campus.\nAman spoke with\nThe Real Deal\nabout quality-of-life issues, office occupancy and playing Rummikub with her kids.\nThis conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\nBorn\n: June 15, 1979\nHometown\n: South Dakota\nLives\n: Los Angeles\nFamily\n: Divorced, 2 kids (16 and 7)\n\u201cAs I show up in places, oftentimes I\u2019m a little bit unexpected, but I feel like I\u2019ve learned over the years how to navigate that.\u201d\nOn being a woman in the highest tier of the business\nWhere do you live?\nI live in Los Angeles \u2014 in Little Holmby [in Westwood].\nYou\u2019re pretty new to L.A. How have you found it?\nIt\u2019s very welcoming, much more welcoming than I expected it to be.\nYou moved from New York. How\u2019d you like the city?\nI grew up in South Dakota. I went to University of Pennsylvania for school, then I was in New York for four years, Chicago for 11, then back to New York again for eight. So I had two different stints in New York. I liked New York. I had a complicated relationship with New York the first time. I moved there right out of college. I worked for Deutsche Bank and our building was right across from the World Trade Center. So that really impacted my experience in New York the first time around. It was very different the second time.\nWere you at work on 9/11?\nI was there. I don\u2019t want the whole thing to be about that. It was so long ago at this point, but I hadn\u2019t gotten to work just yet. I got off the subway that morning at the World Trade Center exit after the first plane hit, but before the second plane, so I was standing right outside, beneath the South Tower when it was hit. Our building was destroyed. They had a disaster recovery location in New Jersey for a while, and then we had a temporary location in Midtown.\nKilroy\u2019s assets are not in areas impacted by the L.A. wildfires. Did they impact your employees?\nJust one, and that one happened to be me.\nWhere did you go when you were displaced?\nWe stayed at the Fairmont Century Plaza for a couple weeks until I could find a long-term rental.\nWere there a lot of people staying at the hotel in the same predicament?\nYes. It was interesting. You\u2019d sit down at dinner at the restaurant at the hotel, and there\u2019d be somebody next to you who was going through the same thing. Somebody across the way would overhear you and come over and introduce themselves.\nDid you feel a sense of community?\nThere were many moments during the process where we felt a tremendous amount of support from people in the area. We didn\u2019t have a huge sense of community in the Palisades because we\u2019d been there such a short amount of time. We moved in in June. Both my kids are at private schools outside the Palisades. So my daughter is at Crossroads, which is in Santa Monica, and my son is at Harvard-Westlake, which is in Studio City. And that was really a blessing, because both of them could go back to their actual schools after they were closed down for a week.\nHave you been back to the Palisades?\nI have not. I had a basement in the house, which means everything\u2019s in the basement that I can\u2019t get down to. So I can\u2019t really sift through things or look for mementos or anything like that.\nHow do you think L.A. is doing?\nIt\u2019s definitely been our slowest market. We\u2019ve seen some interesting things percolating, like in Culver City. There have been some signs of tech coming back in the market. So I think that\u2019s all been encouraging. We don\u2019t have anything in Century City but I feel like we\u2019re going to be the beneficiary of continued activity in Century City that eventually spills over here.\nThere\u2019s a lot going on in L.A. with the fires, the homeless, crime, etc. If you were mayor right now, what would you do to improve things?\nI think focusing on quality-of-life issues, which include safety, addressing homelessness, addressing some of the drug use, things like that, are critically important to making residents and businesses feel good about making long-term decisions. And we\u2019ve seen that really play out in San Francisco over the last few years, where the voting population has really made some strong statements about their priorities on those issues. They put a new district attorney in place. San Francisco now has a new mayor. San Francisco has a moderate majority on the board of supervisors. I think everything you\u2019ve heard from the new administration in San Francisco is that they\u2019re primarily focused on these issues as a means to revitalize the city. I\u2019ve been up to San Francisco probably at least once a month over the course of the last year, given our portfolio up there, and you can really see and feel the difference each and every time I\u2019m up there. Things feel better.\nYou replaced John Kilroy Jr., the longtime leader of the company and son of Kilroy\u2019s founder John Kilroy Sr. What\u2019s the most challenging part of becoming a CEO at a family business?\nThis is the fourth real estate platform I\u2019ve come into at an executive level. It is the first company that has more of a family legacy, but it is a publicly traded company, and has been for many, many years now.\nYou\u2019ve been in this role for a little over a year. What\u2019s your greatest achievement to date?\nWe\u2019ve made a lot of changes on the platform. So we\u2019ve made some key senior hires, some promotions \u2014 really, just getting the company set up from an organizational standpoint the way I would like it to be, so that as market activity recovers, we\u2019re really positioned to execute and to outperform. And I think we\u2019ve made a ton of strides on that front over the last year.\nWhat\u2019s been your biggest career gaffe?\nMy first role as a public company executive was as CFO for a company that IPO-ed in 2012 called Retail Properties of America, or RPAI. It was an open-air shopping center platform, similar to Brixmor, based in Chicago. I ended up leaving through what was a mutual separation in 2015. They were coming from very different directions, and I, in many ways, lacked the professional maturity at that point in my career to understand how to close that gap.\nHow would you describe your leadership style?\n\nI have very high expectations. I believe everybody in the organization can meet those high expectations, but I have very high expectations.\nIt is still unusual to be heading up a massive public real estate company as a woman.\nThere aren\u2019t many of us.\nDo you feel like you deal with discrimination?\nI don\u2019t want to overstate it, but it\u2019s a combination probably of being a woman and being my age. As I show up in places, oftentimes I\u2019m a little bit unexpected, but I feel like I\u2019ve learned over the years how to navigate that.\nWhat\u2019s Kilroy\u2019s work-from-office policy?\nWe are in the office four days a week. We are remote optional on Fridays.\nWhat percent of your tenants are back in the office?\nWe\u2019ve seen pretty high office utilization rates or physical occupancy rates in markets like San Diego in particular; Austin also has been pretty healthy for a while. San Francisco has lagged.\nWhat\u2019s the rate in San Francisco?\nIt\u2019s probably 60-ish percent at this point.\nHow about in L.A.?\nL.A. has been a little bit lower, probably between 50 and 60 percent.\nIn November 2024, you sold Kilroy\u2019s corporate aircraft for $19.8 million. Why?\nOur portfolio is concentrated in five markets that are relatively close together and all pretty easy to get to. And we felt like using commercial airlines was a better alternative for us as a company.\nWhat\u2019s your morning routine?\nI try to wake up pretty early, at 5:30, do some reading and drink coffee \u2014 lots of coffee, walk the dog, get the kids ready for school, get ready myself. I try to run on the treadmill a few days a week in the mornings. I\u2019m usually in the office at around 8:30.\nWhat did you have for breakfast today?\nToday is a bad example. I just had a protein bar, but usually it\u2019s Greek yogurt and blueberries.\nWhat\u2019s your secret indulgence?\nReading fiction. I love to read, but it\u2019s hard sometimes to feel like reading fiction is productive. I really need it as an escape. I think I\u2019m a better, more grounded person when I\u2019m in the middle of a book I\u2019m enjoying.\n\u201cYou\u2019d sit down at dinner at the restaurant at the hotel, and there\u2019d be somebody next to you who was going through the same thing. Somebody across the way would overhear you and come over and introduce themselves.\u201d\nOn living in a hotel after the Palisades fire\nWhat fiction book are you reading now?\n\u201cTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow,\u201d by Gabrielle Zevin.\nHow would your family describe you in three adjectives?\nBusy, supportive, present, I hope.\nIs there any specific activity you do weekly with your kids?\nWe do Friday night, pizza night. You know, we love playing board games together. We\u2019re a very competitive group. We play Rummikub. We play a lot of Uno. We play a lot of Rack-O. We play a lot of Bananagrams.\nWhat keeps you up at night?\nI sleep pretty well. I\u2019m not much of a ruminator. I make a ton of lists, so as long as it\u2019s in the book, and I know I\u2019m going to address it the next day, I fall asleep as soon as my head hits the pillow.\nNow for a quick L.A.-related lightning round: Tommy\u2019s or In-N-Out?\nIn-N-Out.\nErewhon or Trader Joe\u2019s?\nTrader Joe\u2019s.\nWeed or booze?\nBooze \u2014 oh my mother is gonna read this!\nPalm Springs or Santa Barbara?\nSanta Barbara.\nDisney Hall or Hollywood Bowl?\nI\u2019ll go with Hollywood Bowl.\nPoke or tacos?\nTacos.\nUber or Waymo?\nUber\u2026 Can I change my answer to Waymo? They\u2019re a tenant in Silicon Valley!",

        "content": "Gravel crunches beneath car tires from the first turn into River Street Marketplace\u2019s parking lot as the scent of barbecue wafts into the common areas of San Juan Capistrano\u2019s newest retail center, which is located in California\u2019s oldest neighborhood.\nRiver Street Marketplace is Dan Almquist\u2019s latest retail center and his most ambitious yet. His company, Almquist, which has a portfolio of about 750,000 square feet and growing, gritted its teeth through a decade to get the $70 million, 60,000-square-foot project done. The payoff: the chance to define a new segment of retail \u2014 call it specialty on steroids \u2014 and to join a stage starring prominent retail developers like Don Bren of the Irvine Company and Caruso\u2019s Rick Caruso.\nShopping centers \u2014 both power centers, with big box stores, and smaller neighborhood strips \u2014 have long dominated Orange County\u2019s retail landscape, though there are also trophy indoor shopping malls such as Irvine Company\u2019s Fashion Island and the Segerstroms\u2019 South Coast Plaza.\nAlmquist, still a relative unknown despite his rapid ascension in Southern California retail development, has a different vision.\n\u201cI really want our projects to have a soul,\u201d Almquist said.\nThe gravel in River Street Marketplace\u2019s parking lot, it turns out, is an auditory reference to the sound of rolling wagon wheels. An agrarian theme, complete with a petting zoo, aims to evoke the late 18th century when the Los Rios Historic District was just beginning to take shape here with its first adobe structures and Mission San Juan Capistrano.\nAlmquist, who lives here in San Juan Capistrano, wants you to close your eyes for a moment before you shop, to imagine a farmer with a barn living next door to River Street. Every good retail center needs a story, the developer would tell you.\n\u201cIt\u2019s creating this narrative,\u201d Almquist said. \u201cYou\u2019re not trying to fool people into thinking, \u2018Hey, this is historic,\u2019 but it does come across when there\u2019s a common thread that you weave into these projects.\u201d\nThe businesses don\u2019t sell field hoes or adobe bricks, so the story eventually breaks down. The tenants make the place contemporary. Almquist has a philosophy about tenants: He signs one-third nationals, one-third regionals and one-third locals. At River Street Marketplace, nationals like Free People and Mendocino Farms co-exist with Seager, a surf and Western-inspired brand that has its first-ever store here. There\u2019s organic food retailer Fermentation Farm, a meat market and flower stand, and the Rodeo-branded public market-meets-food hall that\u2019s become the stamp of an Almquist project.\nBut can soul scale? Almquist\u2019s development pipeline is moving fast. With his cowboy aesthetic, he\u2019s avoided the smoothed-out, suited-up style of others in the game, but if Almquist ends up on autopilot, his product could simply add to the state\u2019s aging inventory of bloated malls and uninspiring power centers.\nB\nigger and bigger\nAlmquist\u2019s next beat will be the Canopy at Great Park in Irvine, like River Street but bigger: It\u2019s 91,000 square feet, on the former El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, now a 1,300-acre park with sports facilities, an arts complex\u00a0 and events space that anchor a master-planned community. Groundbreaking is scheduled for this quarter.\nThen there\u2019s a 25,000-square-foot, restaurant-driven space (with a 200-stall parking structure) planned for downtown Fullerton, on Harbor Boulevard next to the Fox Theatre. That\u2019s expected to come online in 2027. In Whittier, Almquist is adding a Rodeo 72 public market this month to an already bustling neighborhood center, bringing the combined retail there to over 151,000 square feet. (Like River Street, the Whittier project has a storied past, built on a portion of what was a 19th-century reform school for boys.)\nIn San Juan Capistrano, where Almquist moved 13 years ago, the company has roughly 25,000 square feet of completed projects outside of River Street. He isn\u2019t done: There are plans for two mixed-use developments spanning nearly 150,000 combined square feet, in addition to the 72-room French Hotel that will include the preservation and reuse of two historic adobe buildings. Also proposed for the city is the mammoth, 65-acre Legacy Ranch, an agricultural, equestrian, event and recreation space.\nIt was never intentional to own and develop this much within the city, Almquist said. But he holds on to a strong desire \u201cto do things right.\u201d\nR\nockin\u2019 the suburbs\nA Japanese couple, Jimmy and Hiroko Ito, purchased the future River Street site in 1959 from the Oyharzabal family, who were some of San Juan Capistrano\u2019s original Basque settlers. After being interned in Manzanar during World War II, the Itos wanted to settle into a community and get business going again. They turned their property into the community\u2019s long-standing plant nursery.\nOver the decades, offers came in to buy their land, and eventually their son Doug Ito and his wife Sheree Ito, decided to sell. They spent a year interviewing and researching buyers before landing on Almquist.\nStill, they faced pushback in town over the sale to a developer.\n\u201cThe final decision was not solely about money,\u201d Sheree and Doug Ito wrote in a 2017 letter to the editor of the local Capistrano Dispatch newspaper. \u201cOur hope was, after 58 years of ownership, we could leave a positive legacy for the Ito family.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not trying to fool people into thinking, \u2018Hey, this is historic,\u2019 but it does come across when there\u2019s a common thread that you weave into these projects.\u201d\nDan Almquist on the historical references in his developments\nNaysayers didn\u2019t think River Street Marketplace made sense for a city known mostly for its mission and the annual celebration to mark the return of the swallows from Argentina back to San Juan Capistrano.\nNeither did brokers.\n\u201cWe went into escrow in 2014, and retail at that time was a lot more conventional,\u201d Almquist said of buying the land for River Street. \u201cThe first three brokers that we interviewed to take the assignment didn\u2019t want to do it. They didn\u2019t think it was a viable project. They thought San Juan was just a sleepy little market.\u201d\nThey get it now.\nLuxury residential broker Phillip Caruso (no relation to Rick Caruso) at Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California grew up in Orange County and sells real estate there.\nIn South County, there\u2019s nothing comparable, Caruso said. Everything else is a \u201cmass mall concept,\u201d he said \u2014 \u201cmid-rise buildings with underground parking in busy centers with a few anchor tenants, like a movie theater, chain restaurants and a few boutiques.\u201d\n\u201cThe only places to go [in the past] that offered an outdoor retail feeling were Laguna Beach or downtown San Clemente, along Del Mar,\u201d he added.\nFor a long time, Orange County wasn\u2019t cool, its neighbors to the north in Los Angeles would say \u2014 too homogenous. But River Street isn\u2019t the first sign of change. Former Quiksilver Inc. President Shaheen Sadeghi\u2019s developments, the Lab and the Camp, brought unique and hip to Costa Mesa in the \u201990s. DJM\u2019s redevelopment of Lido Marina Village beckoned upscale retailers and restaurants to Newport Beach in 2016.\nThe Runyon Group, developers behind the Post Montecito and Platform in Culver City, also believe retail\u2019s future is in the suburbs and are looking in Laguna Beach and Newport Beach for future projects.\nJ\noining the giants\nThe more attention Almquist projects attract, the more the comparisons fly, particularly in Orange County where the Irvine Company is synonymous across asset classes with its meticulous master planned communities and uniform wayfinding signage. Rick Caruso\u2019s retail projects such as the Grove and Americana at Brand have long held court as the primer on how to do premium specialty retail.\nBut where Irvine and Caruso projects are controlled environments, led by CEOs in suits, Almquist is looser. That starts with Almquist himself, who was dressed in Wranglers and a cream-colored button-down from Poncho Outdoors during a recent visit to his company\u2019s headquarters.\n\n\u201cWe all owe Donald Bren a debt of gratitude in how he\u2019s developed the Irvine Ranch,\u201d Almquist said. \u201cI would never want to have a contrast of us and the Irvine Company from the standpoint that I have the utmost respect for what they\u2019ve done.\u201d\nHe will allow that Almquist\u2019s methods are different.\n\u201cI think what we\u2019re doing are these really referential projects,\u201d he said. (Meaning: the adobe. The farms. The onetime reform school.)\nDevelopment wasn\u2019t an intentional career path for Almquist.\nHe worked in sales after graduating from the University of California San Diego and then got his MBA from the University of Southern California. Development offered Almquist something tangible for the \u201cfruits of my labor,\u201d he said. Born and raised in Orange County, mostly in Tustin, he got the dynamics of the markets he went on to develop.\nAlmquist, the company, originally began as Frontier Real Estate Investments and cut its teeth on single-tenant net lease retail deals.\nBut Almquist, the person, was also getting his hands in other businesses. He was one of the first franchisees of Dunkin\u2019 Donuts when the chain expanded to Southern California in 2013, with Frontier striking a development deal for 18 locations in central Orange County and L. A. County\u2019s South Bay.\nSo he sees the tenants\u2019 perspectives, Almquist Vice President of Development Tom Carpenter, said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the owner and CEO, yet he\u2019s involved with what some might say are minute details on how things look or feel,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cWe\u2019re notorious for making changes to projects while we\u2019re building or designing them.\u201d\nCarpenter, a former leasing broker, joined Almquist to help find sites 12 years ago and watched the company\u2019s transformation.\n\u201cWe were going out and buying hard corners to do banks, drive-thrus, drugstores and then over time we started to do 2- to 3-acre sites and then that evolved into 10-acre sites,\u201d Carpenter said.\nBut six or seven years ago, that changed.\n\u201c[Dan] didn\u2019t want to be like a lot of other developers trying to tie up corners and lease to tenants,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cHe wanted to create these cool spaces and go after real estate that\u2019s special \u2014 irreplaceable sites.\u201d\nS\ntanton\u2019s rodeo\nFor decades, big box stores squeezed out mom and pops. Then came e-commerce, which kept hollowing out main streets.\nIn Orange County\u2019s city of Stanton, things went the other way.\nAlmquist already had the site for what would become Rodeo 39, Almquist\u2019s 41,000-square-foot public market, when he went to the International Council of Shopping Centers\u2019 annual conference in 2018 with Carpenter. They already had two markets back out of a deal when they scheduled a meeting with an interested discount grocer at the retail conference.\nBut Almquist and Carpenter left the meeting unsatisfied \u2014 this wasn\u2019t what they wanted.\nThey decided to DIY the food anchor tenant. They clocked time in nearby Little Saigon to understand the community, its large Vietnamese population and what the younger demographic might want.\nThey came up with the Rodeo concept: a hall of small vendors adorned with colorful murals.\nIn late 2020, Rodeo 39 opened, with lines around the center. The 30-or-so occupants are non-credit tenants selling everything from fresh donuts and pho; there\u2019s a vintage retailer and tattoo parlor.\nBut then came more pandemic restrictions. Almquist had to figure out food delivery operations to stay afloat \u2014 and to make sure their vendors did.\nOnce restrictions were lifted, business took off. On a recent weekday afternoon, Phoholic and the Crawfish Hut were packed, with the lunch rush spilling out into the outdoor patio.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an attraction for everybody in Orange County because we were the only game in town to have that conceptual center,\u201d said Stanton Mayor Dave Shawver \u2014 a 55-year resident and 37-year City Council member. \u201cIt really inspired people to come in and shop and dine in Stanton, which of course helped our economy.\u201d\nStanton is a little over 3 square miles, with State Route 39 running through it and seven surrounding cities. Until Almquist, its main attraction was the Adventure City theme park, which sits in the shadow of Knott\u2019s Berry Farm in Buena Park and Disneyland in Anaheim.\nSince Rodeo 39\u2019s arrival, two upscale apartment communities have gone up. Bonanni Development completed the 300-unit VRV in 2023 and the 321-unit Cloud House this year.\n\u201cWe\u2019re the little engine that always thought it could,\u201d Shawver said.\nRodeo 39 sets a high bar. A lot of developers want to engage in \u201cplacemaking,\u201d to turn a brand new structure into a real place where people go. So far, Almquist seems to do this better than most.\n\u201cEvery developer has some self-interest, but a lot of developers are in it for their own personal gain,\u201d Shawver said. \u201cDan is a gentleman that kept his word. His word is his bond and I admire him for that.\u201d Stanton, he said, had given Almquist a $2.3 million loan in the form of a sales tax revenue credit, and Almquist paid it back five years early.\nOutside Almquist\u2019s home, there is a bronze statue by the artist Bradford J. Williams. Two larger-than-lifesize cowboys, each atop a horse, shake hands. It\u2019s called \u201cBinding Contract.\u201d He has a second, smaller version at his office.\nThe more Almquist develops, the more he confronts questions of what\u2019s next, and where, and whether the successes of Rodeo 39 or River Street Marketplace can be replicated again and again.\nAlmquist shies away from numbers on the size of his real estate portfolio as a gauge of success or a way to forecast the future.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be the biggest guy,\u201d he said. \u201cI just want to do really good projects.\u201d",

        "content": "It\u2019s contagious.\nThe strain on Chicago\u2019s depressed office market has officially wiped out its unsecured lenders \u2014 funders who once thought downtown properties were so safe they didn\u2019t need collateral.\nA trio of pre-pandemic bets that Chicago-based Nuveen \u2014 the investment arm of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America, or TIAA \u2014 made by providing big-time Windy City landlords mezzanine loans on top of their massive first mortgages look unlikely to pan out, and Nuveen and its affiliates are on the verge of taking a fourth painful hit in Chicago\u2019s commercial property debt market.\nHow the investments vanished is a prime example of risky high-leverage strategies that load up properties with extra debt coming back to bite landlords and their lenders, especially when economic conditions go from boom at a deal\u2019s origination to bust by maturity.\nOne building, owned by\nBlackstone\n, entered foreclosure litigation in February over a default on its $310 million first mortgage, jeopardizing Nuveen\u2019s $60 million second-loan position; a second building has lost so much value there\u2019s talk of it becoming the\nworld\u2019s tallest to ever be torn down\n; and another has already sold at a massive discount that wiped out Nuveen\u2019s mezzanine loan position while also damaging mortgage lender Morgan Stanley\u2019s senior debt package.\n\u201cThese were mid-2010s deals made pre-COVID. Nuveen had a bunch of money to put out and by historic metrics they should not have lost all their investment,\u201d an expert on Chicago\u2019s office market said.\nUnlike lenders who underwrite traditional mortgages, mezzanine money types can\u2019t do much to improve building operations or modify loan terms \u2014 as a TIAA account\u2019s annual report, filed in March, notes in one disclosure of risk.\n\u201cAs a subordinated lender, the account may have limited rights to exercise control over the process by which the mortgage loan is restructured or the property is liquidated following a default,\u201d the section reads. \u201cAny of these circumstances may result in the account being unable to recover some or all of its original investment.\u201d\nMezzanine lending is a shadowy world, since it\u2019s rare that any public records document when these loans get made, unlike traditional mortgage debt. All together, Nuveen\u2019s string of deals threatens to evaporate about $280 million in credit it extended to major real estate owners as distress roils Chicago\u2019s office market.\nNow, another bet that Nuveen placed on\n321 North Clark Street\n, in the summer of 2021, is entering the danger zone.\nNuveen said that the company was working to modify the loans on 321 North Clark but declined to answer bigger-picture questions about distress at buildings where it had made loans. Its borrowers that own Chicago offices either declined to comment or didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The people who spoke about Nuveen\u2019s misses were granted anonymity to discuss sensitive financial matters.\nT\nhe empty office problem\nBy pre-pandemic standards, Nuveen\u2019s positions were assumed to be safe at the properties, which include Blackstone\u2019s 350 North Orleans; the 65-story 311 South Wacker, owned by a joint venture of Zeller and Cindat; and\n600 West Chicago Avenue\n, which just sold for $89 million to former Phoenix Suns owner Robert Sarver\u2019s firm.\nBut the shift to remote work and ensuing interest rate hikes depressed the market to an unmanageable extent for several of Nuveen\u2019s borrowers, not only in Chicago but across the U.S., its financial disclosures show.\n\nAt 311 South Wacker, the lender has publicly acknowledged that it\u2019s unlikely to receive any of the $93 million in principal it provided to its landlord.\nThe 1.6 million-square-foot West Chicago Avenue sale price was less than 20 percent of the $510 million that its previous owner, Sterling Bay, paid for the property in 2018. The deal wiped out much of Morgan Stanley\u2019s $374 million mortgage loan, as well as all of Nuveen\u2019s $54 million mezzanine position, according to people familiar with the sale.\n\u201cThe building is frozen. The challenge was always whenever you have multiple parties involved in the ownership front, equity or debt, getting decisions made just becomes impossible.\u201d\na source familiar with 321 North Clark, a building with mezz debt from Nuveen\nNuveen\u2019s deal at 321 North Clark, where in 2021 it gave a $296 million floating rate loan to the Hines-led landlord entity, still has a fighting chance to get back on track. Nuveen sold off about $222 million of the debt to a consortium of German banks, while keeping an approximately $74 million mezzanine position, according to public records and people familiar with the property.\nBut the building\u2019s cash flow constricted, as interest rate hikes that started in 2022 spiked the cost of debt service. Leasing efforts have paused while Hines and its two landlord partners, Chicago-based Diversified Real Estate Capital and Los Angeles-based American Realty Advisors, try to hash out a resolution with their German lenders and Nuveen to the $250 million remaining total balance in debt. There\u2019s a chance the property\u2019s value has already dipped below the outstanding debt, a person familiar with the situation said.\n\u201cThe building is frozen,\u201d another person familiar with the property said. \u201cThe challenge was always whenever you have multiple parties involved in the ownership front, equity or debt, getting decisions made just becomes impossible.\u201d\nA spokesperson from Nuveen said the company was in \u201cactive negotiations with the borrower and the senior lender group to modify the position.\u201d\nWhile 321 North Clark is 85 percent leased now, its\nsecond-biggest tenant, CBRE\n\u2014 the world\u2019s largest commercial real estate brokerage \u2014 is in talks to move out of its 61,400 square feet into the Irvine Company-owned skyscraper nearby at 300 North LaSalle Street. (The CBRE move is likely contingent on a deal to take over property management and leasing for Irvine\u2019s in-house team at its three-tower Chicago office portfolio, according to a source.)\nV\nulnerable\nChicago is far from alone in handing losses to mezzanine lenders.\nForeclosure notices on mezzanine loans reached an all-time high in 2023. That\u2019s the same year the TIAA account that provided mezzanine debt to Blackstone\u2019s 350 North Orleans and the troubled 311 South Wacker chalked up losses of $344 million in its loans receivable business, according to its annual report. That was followed up by $170 million in losses last year for the category.\nLast year\u2019s lumps were caused by \u201cunfavorable valuations\u201d of three loans, the annual report said. It\u2019s worth noting Nuveen\u2019s loan receivables business, which primarily includes mezzanine loans, represented only 3.5 percent of the account\u2019s total investments, while real estate and real estate joint venture investments represented about 85 percent.\nUnlike some lenders, Nuveen is unafraid to take on ownership. Last year, it seized three office properties where it made big loans through deeds in lieu of foreclosure, including the 253,000-square-foot Stratum building in Austin, Texas, whose former owner owed Nuveen a total of $51 million in senior and mezzanine debt as of 2023, the lender\u2019s annual report shows.\nThe others it took back were a 267,000-square-foot Portland, Oregon, building, and a 333,000-square-foot office building in Herndon, Virginia, valued at $43.6 million.\nIn Chicago, Nuveen is unlikely to move to take over ownership of 311 South Wacker or 350 North Orleans, which remain burdened by massive first-lien mortgages that exceed the diminished property values.",

        "content": "The \u201cIt Buildings\u201d in each of\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nmarkets are condo developments that typify the moment in their regions, according to brokers, insiders and our reporters\u2019 carefully honed instincts.\nYou can read the full series\nhere\n.\nThe St. Regis has mirrored the ups and downs of Chicago\u2019s downtown condo market since local developer Magellan brought its 393 luxury residences for sale. The tower at 363 East Wacker Drive is connected to a 192-room St. Regis hotel tower in a sleek, tiered Jeanne Gang-designed building whose color and waved exterior evoke Lake Michigan.\nThe $1 billion hotel and condo megadevelopment broke ground in 2016 and was originally named the Wanda Vista Tower after the Chinese multinational conglomerate, Dalian Wanda Group, that funded the development. Magellan Development Group bought out Dalian Wanda Group\u2019s 90 percent stake in the project in the fall of 2020 and struck a deal with St. Regis Hotels &amp; Resorts.\nThe building opened shortly thereafter. But downtown Chicago was a whole new world from the one in which the project had been planned and built. Homebuyers were now leaving downtown condos in search of roomier homes farther from the city center.\nAlmost five years later, Chicago\u2019s condo market has not returned to pre-pandemic health, though a rebound in sales hints at a recent thaw. At the St. Regis, developers are still working to sell remaining available units.\nThe Residences at St. Regis notched 26 sales last year \u2014 an average of 2.16 per month \u2014 excluding a recent bulk sale, according to MLS data. This put the project on the same slow pace as other recently opened luxury buildings downtown and marked an improvement over a slow 2023 selling season at the St. Regis and within the broader downtown condo market.\nBut buzz might be building again. There were three multi-million dollar sales at the St. Regis in early January, two of which were over $6 million \u2014 a strong start to the new year. A 76th-floor unit went for $8.3 million in November, making it the most expensive sale at the 101-story skyscraper since a Mexican mining executive purchased the 71st and 72nd penthouse floors for $20.6 million in a much healthier condo market back in 2022.\nThe second wind comes with some sacrifice.\nIn 2023, when selling downtown condos was like \u201ccrickets,\u201d as one broker put it, developer Magellan decided to take out a $150 million loan against unsold condo units at the building. Condo inventory loans like these are typically used to allow for more time to sell, in the hopes of achieving higher prices.\n\nThen, in November, Magellan sold 84 units to GD Holdings for $117 million, or almost $1.4 million per unit, in a bulk sale. Denver-based GD Holdings previously purchased the hotel portion of the property in a nine-figure deal.\nNow, the building\u2019s original investor, Dalian Wanda Group, is gearing up for another bulk sale to offload 37 condo units \u2014 the remainder of its stake in the property, according to CoStar.\nBulk sales like these can be a knock on a project, sparking concern about a building\u2019s financial health, particularly if it\u2019s been on the market for a while, according to David Wolf, local broker and CEO of Wolf Development Strategies.\nBut bulk sales don\u2019t always signal deeper distress, Wolf said. Much of the St. Regis\u2019 remaining units are pricier, making them hard to sell at a time when luxury buyers seem to seek a lower price point.\nA media representative for Magellan declined to respond to questions from The Real Deal about the bulk sale, or recent discounted sales.\nCarrie McCormick, a top broker with @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, said she never lost confidence in the building as a good investment opportunity because of its location, management and the strength of the brand.\n\u201cThe prices did dip a little bit over there,\u201d she said. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s a good buying opportunity, very similar to a stock. Something that\u2019s a good brand, but they went through a tough time, and it\u2019s buying low and selling high.\u201d\nLuxury brokers like McCormick still vie for listings in the St. Regis, with McCormick prepping to list a 32nd-floor unit in May, because, at an asking price around $2 million, even the building\u2019s smaller sales are sizable for the Chicago market.\nLeila Zammatta, senior vice president of sales with Magellan Development, is still heading sales at the St. Regis.\nA media representative for Magellan declined to respond to questions about the pace of sales at the building or the number of vacant units that remain available, but said that \u201csales are on track with our expectations in 2025.\u201d",

        "content": "When Irish investor and TV personality Sean Conlon\u2019s River North loft office building\nwas hit\nwith a foreclosure lawsuit last year, it accelerated his exit from Chicago.\nConlon began his commercial real estate career in the city and eventually expanded elsewhere, including North Carolina, Dallas and West Palm Beach. True, he had been selling off his Chicago assets for years, but he hoped to hang onto the River North office, one of his last holdings in the city.\nThen his\nproperty tax\nbill pushed the already struggling office into the red.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unbelievable international city,\u201d he said, but \u201cthe property taxes are out of control.\u201d\nChicago has emerged from the pandemic with some of its fundamentals intact: It\u2019s got college-educated residents, good public transportation, a diverse job market, strong rent growth and logistical advantages for the industrial sector. None of that seems to make up for the ghost that keeps haunting the place: Cook County property tax policy, which is still scaring away investors and stifling economic recovery.\nThe problem is that commercial properties are not only taxed at a higher percentage of their value than residential properties \u2014 a longtime issue \u2014 but that the county\u2019s recent tax reform attempts have also added unpredictability to the mix. Plus, even as market values correct to reflect the impact of Covid, assessments haven\u2019t adjusted at the same rate.\nChicago\u2019s effective tax rate for commercial properties worth $1 million in 2023 was the highest in the nation and more than double the average effective tax rate of 53 other major U.S. cities, a study from the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy found.\nFlawed system,\u00a0flawed recovery\nBy the time Conlon\u2019s foreclosure filing hit in 2024, the property taxes on his building had increased by 166 percent, nearly tripling since he bought it in 2015.\n\u201cFor the last three or four years I was paying $55,000 a month extra to carry it,\u201d he said. \u201cMy property taxes on that building are about half a million dollars a year and the asset is probably worth $3 million.\u201d\nCook County records show Conlon\u2019s tax bill peaked at $521,000 in 2021 and came in at $451,000 in 2023. Last year, the value was $8.8 million, but a successful appeal to the assessor lowered it to $6.5 million.\nConlon thinks the value should be even lower, considering the building\u2019s occupancy had fallen to less than 60 percent.\nWhen commercial real estate values fall drastically, owners pay less in taxes, and municipal coffers grow dry, which can set off the dreaded doom loop where cities can\u2019t invest in services, population drops and property values fall even further.\nLike many other real estate professionals in the city, Conlon believes Cook County Tax Assessor Fritz Kaegi has been\novervaluing commercial properties\nto stave off such an outcome.\n\u201cBoth on the development side and the acquisition side, we are immediately told by investors from out of state, \u2018anything but Cook County,\u2019\u201d Brian Goldberg, CEO of Chicago-based development firm LG Group, said. \u201cLiterally any other county outside Cook is fine by them because they have a reasonable expectation of what the taxes will be.\u201d\nIn the 2021 assessment cycle, Kaegi overvalued commercial properties in Chicago by nearly 20 percent prior to appeals, a recently released\nstudy\ncommissioned by Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle found. In the suburbs, commercial properties tended to be undervalued. The assessor said his office is not targeting commercial property owners in Chicago.\n\u201cOur assessment models are not designed to favor one type of property over another,\u201d Kaegi said in a written statement to\nThe Real Deal,\nadding that commercial and residential values are calculated separately.\nBut local real estate players say more investor confidence is going to be needed to help the city recover and reach its full potential. Office vacancy has been stuck around 25 percent since the pandemic, the incoming multifamily pipeline is virtually nonexistent and several megadevelopments are currently on pause due to lack of financing.\nAnd the city and county will have to get out of their own way before they can expect institutional capital to flow in.\nR\neform?\nGoldberg\u2019s contention aside, issues do extend beyond Cook County.\nThe state\u2019s mass appraisal system groups properties together to determine their values, which can cause assessors to miss unique property attributes that might push a value higher or lower.\nIllinois also requires local government bodies such as city councils and school districts to set their budgets before property values are assessed. That means rather than the assessor giving budget makers a target of available property tax revenue to aim for, local agencies give property owners a total dollar amount they\u2019ll need to generate via taxation, and the assessor determines how to distribute the bill.\nCommercial property owners take an extra hit in Chicago because unlike the rest of the state, Cook County taxes commercial properties at a higher rate than residential properties. Residential properties are taxed based on 10 percent of their value while commercial properties are taxed at 25 percent of their value.\nThe dynamic has fostered a\nlucrative property tax appeal\nbusiness and led to dramatic reductions in values between a property\u2019s initial assessment and its final assessment after appeals.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not as scared. \u2026 It\u2019s not the worst case scenario.\u201d\nAndy Friedman, multifamily broker\n\nKaegi took office as a change agent after an eight-year stint by his predecessor \u2014 longtime Democratic machine boss Joseph Berrios \u2014 ended with several of his former employees facing federal bribery charges. And in the last two years, criminal convictions of two of the biggest players in the property tax appeal business, powerful former fellow Democratic lawmakers Michael Madigan and Ed Burke, added to the perception that the system is being cleaned up.\nBut Kaegi\u2019s reforms to what was already a flawed system haven\u2019t transformed Chicago into a safe bet for investors because change is hard.\n\u201cThey could have been corrupt, they could have been wrong, they could have been low, sure, all that, but at least they were consistent and predictable,\u201d Goldberg said of prior regimes.\nShifting the county\u2019s tax burden from residential tax payers to commercial tax payers has been a badge of honor for Kaegi. His shakeups in the last year include closing an \u201capartment loophole\u201d that allowed some owners of small to midsize mixed-use properties to claim the county\u2019s lower residential tax rate despite their commercial use and releasing a report that slammed commercial appraisers for undervaluing commercial properties to influence property tax appeals.\nWhen his final assessments of the urban core came out, a summary report stated that \u201cbecause commercial property increased in value by more than residential property, homeowners saw their share of the tax base drop from 51 percent to 49 percent.\u201d\nKaegi also said at the time that he took the strong performance of non-office properties and class A offices into account. He placed higher value on Class A offices than Class B and C offices that have been losing tenants to high-end buildings and struggling to replace them.\n\u201cA strong market for multifamily apartments and industrial properties helped boost commercial property values in 2024 and offset more modest growth in the office sector,\u201d Kaegi said. \u201cThe residential housing market also grew, but at a slower rate.\u201d\nBut commercial property owners said the changes have lacked transparency.\n\u201cWe have an assessor who is arbitrarily shifting property tax burden onto commercial properties,\u201d said Amy Masters, director of government affairs for BOMA, the office building trade group.\nReexaminations of old tax bills have also revealed discrepancies that add to the lack of trust.\nOne audit found that at least 620 properties were misclassified or undervalued during the 2023 tax year, resulting in an estimated $444 million in missed taxable value.\nH\nope on the horizon\nIf the too-high appraisals keep some investors away from commercial properties, the chaos may also be paradoxically making Chicago a good investment for others.\nBeing underestimated has its advantages, Greg Kirsch, founder of retail brokerage Kirsch Agency, said.\n\u201cI appreciate that we are consistently the underdog in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cI like the idea that there are opportunities for me to broker deals. But I think that 10 years from now, people are going to look back and say, \u2018You know what? This was a really undervalued place.\u2019\u201d\nSeveral proposed reforms released by Preckwinkle\u2019s office offer validation and a glimmer of hope.\nAnd Kaegi said the office has embraced the recommendations and is already implementing some of them.\nOne idea is to maximize communication and data sharing between the tax assessor and the Board of Review so that initial assessments and appealed assessments don\u2019t vary so widely.\nThat\u2019s a reform Goldberg would welcome.\n\u201cThey might raise your taxes 30 percent year-over-year or 100 percent year-over-year, and we don\u2019t know what they\u2019re basing that information on. They don\u2019t have established metrics and transparency with which to justify it,\u201d he said, adding that this creates a high-stakes appeals process.\nKaegi said the assessor\u2019s office has increased transparency by publishing methodology information online and establishing the first ever Director of Commercial Outreach to communicate with real estate professionals.\nMeanwhile, Masters said BOMA is pushing for more flexibility in commercial property tax rates.\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s politically not feasible to flatten the assessment rate so that it\u2019s even for all properties at this time, but we\u2019d like to find ways to make that more flexible, especially during times in the market that are more challenging, like now,\u201d Masters said.\nFor multifamily broker Andy Friedman, Kaegi\u2019s reforms were a tough pill to swallow during his first downtown assessment in 2021. But now, as Kaegi\u2019s second round of triennial assessments gets rolled out, they\u2019re easier to navigate.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not as scared. Yes, he\u2019s re-jiggering assessed values, but the effect, while not good on commercial, is not the worst case scenario,\u201d he said.\nUntil further, commercial-minded reforms take shape, institutions will stay on the sidelines.\n\u201cIt still puts institutions into the position of having to underwrite, if not worst case scenario, a close to worst case scenario,\u201d Friedman added.",

        "content": "Vistria Group has amassed more than $2.5 billion in assets under management for its affordable housing real estate fund, signaling sustained investor interest in the asset class.\nThe fund, launched in 2023 and led by former Goldman Sachs executive Margaret Anadu, has already acquired over 7,000 units, the New York Times\nreported\n.\nThe milestone reflects a broader trend in real estate finance. Even as the private real estate industry emerges from its most difficult fundraising year in more than a decade, affordable housing continues to attract capital.\nThe fund\u2019s backers include investment banks, family offices and insurance companies, indicating that institutional players increasingly view affordable housing as a viable, scalable investment.\nExecutives behind the fund said its appeal comes from its potential financial upside and the sheer size of the market. They pointed to the massive demand for affordable housing across the country and the difficulty of assembling enough capital in one place to compete at scale.\nThe fund has so far focused heavily on high-cost markets like California, where one of its recent standout deals included the conversion of nearly 700 market-rate apartments into affordable units.\n\nRising interest rates and limited housing supply have pushed prices to record highs, intensifying political and public pressure for solutions. Policymakers on both sides of the aisle are exploring zoning reforms and taxpayer subsidies to expand the availability of affordable units, creating incentives for firms like Vistria to scale up.\nThe fund is driven primarily by its commercial opportunity, rather than a mission-oriented focus, and the capital need in affordable housing is still in the trillions, Anadu said.\nMeanwhile, the Department of Government Efficiency, led by billionaire Elon Musk, has\ncanceled millions of dollars in affordable housing contracts\nacross more than 1,000 communities.\nThe agency determined the cuts through an internal review targeting diversity, equity and inclusion language on grantee websites, affecting groups like Enterprise Community Partners and the Local Initiatives Support Corporation that helped administer Section 4 funding from the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nAcross Vistria\u2019s home state of Illinois, federal funding delays have put $52.5 million in grants for at least\n15 affordable housing projects in jeopardy\n.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

You can read the full series\nhere\n.\nJS Sullivan\u2019s Steve Const knew pretty quickly that the San Francisco-based developer had a hit on its hands with Maison Pacific, a six-story 53-unit condo project in Russian Hill that came to market in the fall of 2023 and sold out in a year.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always some early testing that we\u2019ll do and response was strong out of the gate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was off to the races as soon as we released some units.\u201d\nMaison Pacific sold at least four times faster than most other condo projects in San Francisco, according to Polaris data \u2014 more than four units per month, on average.\n\u201cI wish we had 100 Maison Pacifics in our future, and 100 locations that are as unique and desirable as Russian Hill,\u201d Const said.\nIn fact, the three San Francisco condo buildings that sold out in 2024 \u2014 Maison Pacific, TRI Pointe Home\u2019s Lofton at Portola and Prado Group\u2019s 2238 Market \u2014 were all outside of downtown, according to Polaris. District 9, which includes downtown neighborhoods like SoMa, South Beach and the East Cut, has the majority of new construction moving forward in the city but has suffered from the impacts of remote work and negative perceptions surrounding street conditions and safety.\n\u201cThey\u2019re really different marketplaces,\u201d Const said. \u201cThe way neighborhoods function outside of the downtown core it really feels pre-Covid, normal and bustling.\u201d\n\nYet of the 273 condo units under construction in the city, almost all are downtown, according to Polaris.\nIn addition to the premier location, Const said the combination of quality design at an accessible price point with low HOA fees were key to the building\u2019s success.\n\u201cWe typically don\u2019t have a glamorous exercise room or other bells and whistles, and that results in some access points that are really attractive,\u201d he said.\nThere\u2019s also almost no new product coming online outside of downtown in the near future, according to Polaris data. The only other project currently under construction in District 8, which includes Russian Hill, is JS Sullivan\u2019s own 35-unit Norvoir, located across the street from Ghirardelli Square on the site of a former parking garage. Sales are set to kick off later this year and Const said there was already \u201ca good amount of interest,\u201d including from those who missed their shot at Maison Pacific.\n\u201cMaison Pacific was one of the better developments I\u2019ve seen on the north side at that sort of price point in a long time,\u201d Compass agent John Townsend said. March Capital\u2019s luxury project, the Belvedere, a few blocks away on Van Ness, has also been attractive: Out of 28 units, 17 have sold since it came to market in January 2024, according to Polaris data.\nNot being on a major corridor like Van Ness and instead on trendy Polk Street one block away was a \u201chuge, huge benefit\u201d to Maison Pacific, Townsend added. While the finishes \u201cdidn\u2019t blow me out of the water,\u201d as compared to a luxury product like the Belvedere, they are still nice, he said, and the building, including its rooftop deck, is oriented to take advantage of Russian Hill and Marina views.\nCondo buyers don\u2019t typically want to be downtown, he said, though there have been a few notable exceptions like the $11.25 million penthouse sale at Related\u2019s the Avery in the East Cut. There\u2019s not much he can offer his buyers that\u2019s new outside of downtown, he said, so they mostly end up buying resales.\nThere are over 1,000 condo units approved on the city\u2019s popular north side, according to Polaris, but other developers aren\u2019t moving forward with their projects. Const said the possibility of neighborhood objections could be deterring developers who want more certainty \u2014 but that he had no easy answers.\n\u201cI think if I did, I would have the magic formula to save San Francisco,\u201d he joked.",

The area now has 4.4 million square feet of offices, industrial and commercial buildings, while the plan calls for another 2.1 million square feet in the next two decades.\nIn May, Walnut-based Shea Homes floated a plan to build\n164 condos\nin northwest Livermore, including 33 affordable units and 17 Americans with Disabilities Act-accessible units. The gray and white complex would include for-sale condos between 1,400 and 1,850 square feet.\nIn December, the Livermore Planning Commission approved\nCornerstone, a 253-unit condominium and affordable housing complex\nby Idaho-based Pacific Companies at Collier Canyon Road and Constitution Drive, according to the Business Times.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "The \u201cIt\u201d buildings in each of The Real Deal\u2019s markets are condo developments that typify the moment in their regions, according to brokers, insiders and our reporters\u2019 carefully honed instincts.\nYou can read the full series\nhere\n.\nBill Ackman had notes when Howard Hughes CEO David O\u2019Reilly first pitched his pricing plan for Ritz-Carlton Residences, the Woodlands\u2019 first condo project.\nThe activist investor and former chairman of Howard Hughes responded, \u201cIt\u2019s too cheap,\u201d board member Mary Ann Tighe remembers. He instructed O\u2019Reilly and Bonnie Wedemeyer, the company\u2019s executive VP for condo sales, to go back to the drawing board.\nO\u2019Reilly and Wedemeyer weren\u2019t using comps, because there are no comps. To price these condos, first, they had to come up with their own yardstick.\nIn addition to being the first condo project in the Woodlands, the Ritz-Carlton Residences is among the first of its kind in the Lone Star State. High-end condos are a dime a dozen in places like South Florida, but in Texas, luxury residential real estate has long revolved around the ranch.\nDouglas Elliman was tracking just nine branded condo projects in Texas\u2019 pipeline in January, and this one is Ritz-Carlton\u2019s first stand-alone condo play in the state. Put simply, the developer is testing out demand in Texas\u2019 squishy condo market with a massive swing.\nAckman was right.\nBefore the foundation was laid, 69 percent of the 111 units were pre-sold. Howard Hughes paused pre-sales, and there\u2019s a waitlist, Tighe said. Douglas Elliman has the exclusive listing.\n\n\u201cI am not going to limit the imagination of my buyers of the last 30 percent of those units by telling you what I think it\u2019s going to be,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said with a smile.\n\u201cWe\u2019re breaking all sorts of records in Texas.\u201d\nIf the company had priced the project according to the comps available, \u201cWe never would have built it,\u201d he added.\nThe company hasn\u2019t shared prices for the units, which range in size from 1,400 square feet to more than 5,100 square feet, but said the presales amounted to more than $250 million which works out to $3.25 million on average, per unit.\nThe project, designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects, includes a 15-story building and an 11-story building on 8 acres. The property features 1,200 feet of private shoreline on the community\u2019s centerpiece, Lake Woodlands. There\u2019s a boathouse, pickleball court and wine cellar.\nIt\u2019s expected to be delivered in 2027.\nThe popularity of the project speaks to the demand for high-end condo living in Texas. Howard Hughes said the Ritz caters to empty nesters looking to downsize without compromising on luxury.\nThe Woodlands\u2019 Ritz-Carlton isn\u2019t the only Houston-area project proving Texans\u2019 appetite for vertical luxury living.\nAll but two units at Randall Davis Company\u2019s condo project London House in River Oaks have been pre-sold. Standard units started at $1.5 million; penthouses started at $3.8 million. Satya is adding another floor to its planned St. Regis condo tower due to high demand.",

        "content": "David O\u2019Reilly isn\u2019t just the CEO of Howard Hughes Holdings and the de facto mayor of a 120,000-person city in Houston, he\u2019s the person who could turn financier Bill Ackman into the next Warren Buffet.\nO\u2019Reilly and his wife live in an apartment in the company\u2019s centerpiece community, the Woodlands, and while he\u2019s not elected, neighbors still come to him with requests: Can he move a tree in that median? Could he pick a different paint color?\nO\u2019Reilly spends just 10 days a month in his Texas home, the most time he spends anywhere. For the rest of each month, he travels to Howard Hughes\u2019 other master-planned communities: Columbia in Maryland, Summerlin in Las Vegas, Ward Village in Honolulu and the latest, Teravalis in Phoenix.\nMaster-planned communities always have good trails, and most days, wherever he is, the ex-Lehman Brothers, ex-hockey player from Boston goes for a run. The exertion provides clarity to whatever his mind is chewing on, and these days, the spectrum is vast.\nIn Vegas, O\u2019Reilly is playing the part of movie exec, partnering with Sony and Mark Wahlberg to launch a studio in Summerlin. In Phoenix, he\u2019s a water engineer, figuring out how residents of the future 300,000-person city will shower, drink and wash dishes for the next century.\nHis actual electorate is the board, and they\u2019re happy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s four and a half years since he\u2019s been made CEO, and I think you would find \u2014 I know you would find \u2014 a board that universally believes he\u2019s just doing a spectacular job,\u201d New York power broker and Howard Hughes board member Mary Ann Tighe said.\nBut the lovefest in the C-suite belies investors\u2019\nlong-standing disappointment with the company\u2019s stock\n.\nSince billionaire activist investor Bill Ackman, the company\u2019s former chairman, siphoned off Howard Hughes from mall operator General Growth Properties in 2010, the company\u2019s stock price hasn\u2019t reflected the value of the thoughtfully constructed cities Howard Hughes has become known for, those bullish on the company would tell you.\nAs a result, Ackman wants to take the master-planned community company private.\nHe has proposed increasing his firm Pershing Square Capital Management\u2019s stake in the company, then turning Howard Hughes Holdings into the piggy bank for a whole hedged investment strategy, putting the cash HHH throws off into companies that will pay off bigger, sooner. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s job would be ensuring the piggy bank doesn\u2019t crack.\nThere are plenty of potential cracks to watch out for. A Howard Hughes committee\nrejected\nAckman\u2019s price in early March but extended a standstill agreement until early April. There are two months until a Nevada state legislative vote on film tax credits for its movie studio in Summerlin. And, with mortgage rates still high and tariffs threatening homebuilders\u2019 budgets, O\u2019Reilly has a new city to build: Teravalis in suburban Phoenix.\nF\nor sale:\nH\noward Hughes Holdings\nO\u2019Reilly may be the engine of the vehicle that is Howard Hughes, but Ackman is the maker.\nThe polarizing investor went dumpster diving for Howard Hughes when he helped rescue General Growth Properties during the Great Financial Crisis. He bought a $60 million stake in the struggling shopping mall operator and encouraged it to file for bankruptcy. He reportedly netted $1.6 billion from the play.\nAckman looped New York City powerbroker Mary Ann Tighe into his plans for what would become Howard Hughes. The longtime friend of Ackman liked the vision and \u201cthe quality of the assets that were in the rejection pile.\u201d\nEccentric billionaire developer Howard Hughes founded the company in 1972 with assets including the 30,000 acres in Nevada that would become Summerlin. The Rouse Company acquired Howard Hughes Corporation in 1996; General Growth Properties picked it up in 2004.\nMeanwhile, O\u2019Reilly kicked off his career at Lehman Brothers, where he started on the desk on Sept. 10, 2001. He avoided Lower Manhattan until his first interview with Ackman for the CFO job. There, O\u2019Reilly introduced himself boldly as \u201cthe next CFO at Howard Hughes.\u201d\nTighe quickly saw that he was \u201cover-credentialed for the job.\u201d She saw him as on track for more, she said.\nThe gap between Howard Hughes\u2019 stock price and underlying value first brought the company to a crossroads in 2019.\nLeadership, including O\u2019Reilly, who became CEO in 2020, weighed the possibilities of restructuring or selling the company and opted to streamline operations. O\u2019Reilly described the process as feeling like \u201cchefs putting together a great menu for a restaurant.\u201d Howard Hughes moved its headquarters from Dallas to the Woodlands and shifted focus to development, which meant spinning off assets like hotels and restaurants. In July, the company\nsplit off\nits\nSeaport assets\n, leaving just the planned communities.\n\u201cPeople can do their own math.\u201d\nPiper Sandler\u2019s Alexander Goldfarb on the Pershing Square proposal to take Howard Hughes private\nThen, in April 2024, Ackman stepped down as chairman of the company. A potential take-private plan surfaced in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in August. Howard Hughes put together a committee to evaluate a potential deal. O\u2019Reilly isn\u2019t privy.\nThe concept behind the proposal is that the market doesn\u2019t appreciate Howard Hughes. But Ackman does. He thinks the company can be the centerpiece for a bigger hedging strategy.\nAckman, who owns 37.6 percent of the company, outlined a proposal in January. He offered to buy 11.8 million shares of Howard Hughes stock at $85 a share to own a majority stake in the company. He came back with a\nrevised offer\nof $90 and a plan to increase his holdings to 48 percent.\nThe second offer was \u201ca step toward narrowing the valuation gap,\u201d Anthony Paolone, a Howard Hughes analyst with JPMorgan, said. The company puts its net asset value at $118 a share. \u201cPeople can do their own math,\u201d Piper Sandler\u2019s Alexander Goldfarb said.\nA Howard Hughes committee found the offer unacceptable in early March but entered a standstill agreement with Pershing to keep working on it. The standstill originally expired March 13 but was extended to April 7.\nTighe, talking about pricing condos in the Woodlands, said of Ackman: \u201cI joke that when he\u2019s buying, it\u2019s always overpriced, and when he\u2019s selling, we\u2019re selling too cheap.\u201d\nThe same ethos might apply to the take-private proposals.\nAckman, who has criticized the media for not getting stories about him right, didn\u2019t respond to The Real Deal\u2019s request for an interview.\nAnyone concerned about the company\u2019s future given Ackman\u2019s activist past can rest easy, according to O\u2019Reilly: \u201cBill\u2019s history as an activist is very different from his history at Howard Hughes.\u201d\nL\nife in a bubble\nObserving the sprawl from the highways that loop Texas metros can be mind-numbing enough to make you question whether developers were aiming for ugly.\nThe Woodlands offers an alternative to the endless copy-and-paste of single-family development that has come to define Sunbelt cities.\nThirty miles north of Houston, there\u2019s a break in the strip malls that line Interstate 45. The entrance to the 28,500-acre community is its town center, complete with a mall, performing arts center and office buildings.\nSome of the community\u2019s most impressive houses circle the 200-acre Lake Woodlands, where there\u2019s a boathouse and trails, and restaurants that line the eastern shore. Dozens of neighborhoods fan out from the town center, connected by the trail system. It\u2019s as close to walkable as Texas gets. Even the retail strips are tastefully built into the woods, which haven\u2019t been razed \u2014 just as founder George Mitchell intended when he named the development.\nO\u2019Reilly traces the company\u2019s ideology past Mitchell to Jim Rouse, who created Columbia, Maryland. A community could be a \u201cgarden for growing people,\u201d Rouse said.\nInspired by Rouse, Mitchell set up the Woodland\u2019s conservation mindset: 30 percent of the acreage has to be permanent green space. (Mitchell\u2019s also known for inventing fracking, O\u2019Reilly mentioned.) His book sits on O\u2019Reilly\u2019s desk and not just for show; he cracked it to fact-check Columbia\u2019s founding date.\nBut he doesn\u2019t need a book to deliver the company line: \u201cOur job is to build to meet demand, and when we build to meet demand, we can do that at outsized, risk-adjusted returns, creating values for our shareholders.\u201d He also clearly enjoys the work of carefully designing a community, comparing it to playing Sim City.\n\nCorporate relocations are \u201cthe easiest pitch we make,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the office building that I build, lease to them, sell and make profit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all the other pieces of the puzzle that we bring to the table that I don\u2019t think anybody else can do,\u201d like homes for employees\u2019 families, restaurants, schools for their kids.\nThe tight control Howard Hughes exercises can err on the side of cultish. Plus, though the company\u2019s communities represent a departure from typical suburban development, they still cater to families whose idea of a good time might seem tame.\nFor many who call the Woodlands home, being generic is a small price to pay for low crime, good schools and a relatively low cost of living.\nWaste Connections CEO Ron Mittelstaedt moved his company from Sacramento to the Woodlands in 2012. He said about 93 percent of his employees transferred to Texas, and of those, about 90 percent still live there.\n\u201cThis is sort of life in a bubble,\u201d Mittelstaedt said. \u201cAnd for families, maybe not for young singles, life in a bubble is pretty good.\u201d\nS\nhow business\nAt the Woodlands, O\u2019Reilly is mayor. At Summerlin, he\u2019s executive producer.\nHe\u2019s spent the last two years hammering out a corporate relocation of sorts. After reading that Mark Wahlberg, a resident of Summerlin (as of 2022), was interested in building a movie studio in Las Vegas, O\u2019Reilly got in touch.\nThe sons of Boston felt instant rapport over their shared hometown and positioning as \u201cguys who like to make things happen,\u201d Wahlberg said.\nMarky Mark connected O\u2019Reilly with now-former Sony CEO Tony Vinciquerra, who\u2019d been eyeing Las Vegas as a studio site for years. \u201cWe hit it off immediately,\u201d Vinciquerra said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the office building that I build, lease to them, sell and make profit. It\u2019s all the other pieces of the puzzle that we bring to the table that I don\u2019t think anybody else can do.\u201d\nDavid O\u2019Reilly\nThe trio has been lobbying Nevada state legislators to pass \u201cHollywood 2.0,\u201d a bill that would beef up film tax credits and provide the proposed Summerlin Studios $80 million a year in tax credits between 2028 and 2043. Since the pandemic revealed the precarity of Las Vegas\u2019 single-industry economy, political leaders in the state have been trying to diversify, so everyone is hopeful.\nIn presentations, meetings and cocktail receptions for legislative aides, Vinciquerra and O\u2019Reilly have been working to persuade legislators to send resources their way. A lot of the lobbying revolves around correcting misunderstandings about incentives. Per the agreement, the state wouldn\u2019t just funnel Vinciquerra and O\u2019Reilly millions of dollars. They\u2019d have to build a studio on their own dime and produce a film before they see any of the money they\u2019re fighting so hard to get.\nThe current plan involves 10 stages across 31 acres in Summerlin, and they could start construction the day after this bill passes.\nAs of mid-March, Vinciquerra hadn\u2019t talked to O\u2019Reilly about the Ackman proposal. But, he has no reason to believe that it would do anything to keep him from completing the long marathon he\u2019s been running, he said. There have been \u201ca lot of ups and downs\u201d to the process Vinciquerra began about five years ago, \u201cbut it feels very good right now.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that we can get this concluded pretty soon,\u201d he said.\nW\nater and wildlife\nBetween perfecting his pitch to Nevada legislators and managing the delivery of high-profile condo projects in Texas and Hawaii, O\u2019Reilly is getting ready to start the creation cycle once more in the company\u2019s newest place: Teravalis.\nThe development will bloom in the area formerly known as Douglas Ranch in Phoenix\u2019s West Valley, in the town of Buckeye. When complete, it will include 100,000 homes and could have a population of 300,000. Model homes will open this year.\nThe influence of Jim Rouse is all over the website, which describes the community as \u201cbuilt to sustain and nurture people and the world around them.\u201d\nSustaining means you need water, and O\u2019Reilly meets with Buckeye Mayor Eric Orsburn to answer the question: How will these homes get water for the next century? Only after the state issues a certificate of water security can development begin. So far, Howard Hughes has certificates for the first phase of 8,500 homes.\nThe development will be located between two mountain ranges, a road of sorts for animals native to the area, and Orsburn said O\u2019Reilly and his team have taken great care to preserve the wildlife corridor.\n\u201cHe can cite details about the different corridors and how important they are to the wildlife moving back and forth,\u201d Orsburn said.\nMost developers don\u2019t do this, Orsburn said. They think short term.\n\u201cThe guys down the street have a five-year investment, and they don\u2019t care about year six through 50,\u201d as O\u2019Reilly put it.\nIt\u2019s two sides of the same coin: What allows Howard Hughes to make a community click is also what keeps it from performing well in the market.\nBut there are times things move fast. At one point, O\u2019Reilly had a moonshot idea to turn a commercial zone in Teravalis into the Sam Altman Wonder World, complete with open AI data centers and open AI chip manufacturing. He needed an in with Altman.\nWithin an hour, Ackman had arranged for the three to talk the following Sunday morning. While Altman ended up abandoning the idea to manufacture his own chips, the interaction shows how Ackman\u2019s deep pockets and large network complement O\u2019Reilly\u2019s capacity to dream big.\n\u201cHe is a phone call away from getting me on the phone with the CEO,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s like, I gotta make 18 connections on LinkedIn and pray.\u201d\nA\n40-year runway\nIf O\u2019Reilly has vision and Ackman has drive, Jerry Colangelo has patience.\nThe sports executive and businessman has lived in Phoenix, where Teravalis will be, since he became the first general manager of the Suns in 1968.\nHe watched the city explode and bet on its continued growth in 2002 when he bought 37,000 acres in Buckeye, a town about 35 miles west of Phoenix.\nAbout five years ago, when Howard Hughes was looking for its next site, Colangelo\u2019s land fit the requirements: within 50 miles of a major airport, in a business-friendly environment, fully entitled and in a path of growth.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t take him long to piece everything together,\u201d Colangelo said about O\u2019Reilly. \u201cAnd no doubt he saw the future as we believed it was.\u201d\nColangelo sold his holdings and then came back into the deal for 12 percent; it all took just a few months. He visited Summerlin and trusts O\u2019Reilly and Ackman with, well, his legacy.\nBecause this is the meaning of the long-term plays at Howard Hughes: Colangelo, so long the steward of this land, will never see Teravalis finished.\n\u201cIn my mind, I never thought about a 40-year build-out,\u201d Colangelo, who is 85, said. \u201cThat seems like a long time, especially at my age.\u201d",

        "content": "A federal judge has dismissed the corruption charges against Mayor Eric Adams, while ensuring prosecutors cannot revive the case.\nJudge Dale Ho on Wednesday threw out the five-count indictment against the mayor, but required that the case be dismissed with prejudice, meaning that the case cannot be renewed. The Department of Justice had sought to dismiss the case without prejudice, noting that the indictment could be picked back up after the November election.\nElected officials as well as former\nfederal prosecutors\nviewed the DOJ\u2019s request as a blatant attempt to maintain leverage over the mayor to ensure compliance with President Donald Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies and other priorities.\nBut on March 7, an attorney appointed by the court\nrecommended\nthat the judge dismiss the case with prejudice, citing that the possibility of reopening the case would hang \u201clike the proverbial sword of Damocles over the accused.\u201d\n\u201cIn light of DOJ\u2019s rationales, dismissing the case without prejudice would create the unavoidable perception that the Mayor\u2019s freedom depends on his ability to carry out the immigration enforcement priorities of the administration, and that he might be more beholden to the demands of the federal government than to the wishes of his own constituents,\u201d Ho wrote in his decision.\nThe decision puts to rest the criminal case against the mayor, but he still faces an uphill battle to get re-elected.\nThe 57-page indictment, which was\nunsealed\nin September, accused Adams of receiving illegal campaign contributions, as well as various discounted and upgraded international trips and stays at luxury hotels. Wealthy foreign businesspeople and at least one Turkish government official provided these contributions and perks to gain influence over the mayor, according to the indictment.\nThe alleged scheme dated back to Adams\u2019 time as Brooklyn borough president, and prosecutors accused the mayor of knowingly participating and at times, orchestrating it, as well as taking steps to hide the scheme from the public.\n\nThe scheme, as described in the indictment, involved a senior Turkish diplomat who allegedly organized straw donations from a construction company, which was not named in the indictment but appears to be\nKSK Construction\n.\nIn September 2021, three months after Adams\u2019 victory in the Democratic primary ensured his election as mayor in November, the diplomat made clear that it was Adams\u2019 \u201cturn\u201d to reciprocate the support and perks he had received from Turkey. \u201cI know,\u201d Adams wrote, according to the indictment.\nAdams allegedly delivered by pressuring the fire commissioner \u2014 who had asked Adams to keep him in his post upon taking office \u2014 to accelerate a key approval the Turks needed to open a\nnew, 36-story Turkish consular building\nat 821 United Nations Plaza.\nThe mayor has repeatedly maintained that he has not broken the law.\nThe Department of Justice\nordered\nManhattan prosecutors to drop the case in February, pointing to the timing of the indictment, saying it\u00a0 \u201cimproperly interfered\u201d with the mayor\u2019s 2025 mayoral campaign and inhibited Adams\u2019 ability to enforce President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies.\nIn the wake of the directive, several prosecutors and members of the Adams administration resigned. Interim U.S. Attorney in Manhattan Danielle Sassoon was among those who refused to carry out the DOJ\u2019s request. In her resignation letter, Sassoon cited a Jan. 31 meeting between Adams\u2019 attorneys and Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, in which the mayor\u2019s attorneys \u201crepeatedly urged what amounted to a quid pro quo, indicating that Adams would be in a position to assist with the Department\u2019s enforcement priorities only if the indictment were dismissed.\u201d\nSoon after, First Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer, deputy mayors Meera Joshi, Anne Williams-Isom and Chauncey Parker\nannounced\nthey would step down. The resignations escalated calls on the mayor to step down. Gov. Kathy Hochul indicated that she would not remove the mayor, for now, but proposed various checks on his administration and ways for the city to challenge the Trump administration. Those restrictions on Adams, however, have\nnot gone into effect\n.\nAdams faces a crowded primary in June, though some have raised doubts that he will run as a Democrat. Although he once enjoyed support from the real estate industry, many have flocked to former Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s campaign. In the latest fundraising round, Adams only brought in $36,000, compared to Cuomo\u2019s $1.5 million.\n",

        "content": "Donald Trump is no longer the operator of the golf course within Ferry Point Park, but the president could hit it big if a casino is approved for the site.\nTrump would net $115 million if Bally\u2019s receives a gaming license to open a casino at the city-owned golf course in the Bronx\u2019s Throggs Neck neighborhood, the Associated Press\nreported\n. The then-presidential candidate quietly signed the deal when the gaming company acquired the operation rights for $60 million in 2023.\nThe deal was disclosed in a letter that was part of an evidence exhibit in the president\u2019s civil trial in New York. The letter refers to the payday as a nonrefundable \u201cgaming event fee.\u201d\nBally\u2019s did not respond to the outlet\u2019s request for comment, nor did the Trump Organization.\nIt\u2019s unclear how the revelation of Trump\u2019s potential payday would affect the casino license sweepstakes, which is less than three months from a critical application deadline.\nAn additional problem for the Bally\u2019s casino proposal in the Bronx is the need for a parkland alienation bill to free up the land for development.\n\nThe gaming company\nstruggled\nto find the necessary support last year, imperiling the Bally\u2019s bid. But as the process has stumbled along, time has been good for the alienation aspiration; this week, two local legislators announced plans to introduce an alienation bill, the New York Post\nreported\n.\nA similar shift is unfolding for Steve Cohen\u2019s casino proposal next to Citi Field. A state senator this week\nannounced he would sponsor\na parkland alienation bill for the proposed complex in Flushing, Queens.\nBally\u2019s is looking to build a 500,000-square-foot casino on the Bronx site by the golf course, along with a 500-room hotel with a spa and meeting space, retail spaces, a 2,000-seat event center and two parking garages for up to 4,600 vehicles.\nApplications for one of the three downstate gaming licenses are due towards the end of June. Two of the licenses are widely expected to go to a pair of \u201cracinos,\u201d effectively only putting one license in play.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Sitting in Sant Ambroeus in the West Village, Zeve Salman looked out longingly onto the row of eight-figure homes lining Perry Street.\n\u201cIf you gave me five new houses on this street right here, I could sell them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut find me those five houses.\u201d\nSalman, a co-founder of the Elevated Team with Eric Brown at Compass, echoed a refrain common in 2024, chalking up the market\u2019s troubles to a lack of quality inventory.\nBut Salman and Brown, who this year appear in\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s agent rankings for the first time, found ways to get deals done in a market stifled by high interest rates and political and economic uncertainty.\n\u201cLast year was a challenging year, and it was just a year of sort of confusion and uncertainty,\u201d said Brown Harris Stevens CEO Bess Freedman.\nAs Corcoran\u2019s Kane Manera sees it, that has all shaken out in the form of a pretty efficient market, if not one that is setting price or transaction records.\n\u201cThings from where I stand are efficient,\u201d he said, pointing to the stalemate between buyers and sellers. \u201cIt\u2019s a fairly priced market where buyers and sellers are meeting.\u201d\nAdd to the mix antitrust settlements that shook the industry for much of the past year and changed how agents get paid, and many in the city are already eager to turn the corner to see what 2025 might hold.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unpredictable, and there is volatility,\u201d said Kevelyn Guzman, regional vice president of Coldwell Banker Warburg. But she added that since the start of 2025, \u201cwe\u2019ve seen a shift in a good way. We\u2019ve seen [the market] pick up.\u201d\nHighs and lows\nThe city\u2019s residential market was a rollercoaster last year, alternating high highs with low lows. Transactions lagged in the first half of the year, as high mortgage rates locked sellers into their homes and kept price-conscious buyers on the sidelines.\nBy the summer, all signs pointed to the Federal Reserve finally lowering interest rates. Mortgage rates fell in anticipation, kickstarting deals across the city.\nThough mortgage rates only dropped temporarily, the movement was enough to fuel a string of activity through the fall, a season many in the industry expected to be tempered leading up to the presidential election.\n\u201cIt was kind of like a tale of two markets,\u201d said Douglas Elliman\u2019s Noble Black, whose team ranked in the top 20 in both resale and new development categories.\nBlack described the first half of the year as \u201clackluster,\u201d but by July, \u201ca huge amount of energy\u201d had returned to the market.\nAlong with the sales boom came the return of nine-figure deals in Manhattan, which hadn\u2019t logged a deal of that size in two years.\nFirst, a duplex penthouse at Extell Development\u2019s Central Park Tower closed for $117 million, followed by the crown jewel penthouse at OKO Group\u2019s Aman New York, which sold for $135 million to the building\u2019s developer, Vlad Doronin.\n\u201cThe mood changed,\u201d said Pam Liebman, the CEO of Corcoran Group, which again topped\nTRD\n\u2019s ranking of residential brokerages in Manhattan.\nLiebman added that while the market entered 2024 on uneven footing, it ended the year with a renewed sense of confidence, with the results of a presidential election in the books and strong stock and crypto markets padding the pockets of wealthy buyers.\n\u201cPeople started to realize that there wasn\u2019t going to be an influx of inventory anytime soon,\u201d said Liebman. \u201cThey had to get their lives moving, and it seemed like a pretty good time to buy.\u201d\nBut the year of the market\u2019s return also marked a period of change for residential brokerage.\n\nFollowing the National Association of Realtors\u2019 settlement in 2023, brokerages across the country announced their own deals to satisfy the onslaught of litigation, with firms and trade associations rolling out new rules regulating how brokers do business.\nThe Residential Board of New York kicked off the year by removing buyer agent commission offers from the residential listing service. The organization, which has yet to settle lawsuits filed against it over similar commission-related claims, also started pushing for agents to use buyer agreements \u2014 a move that has been met with a mix of praise, apathy and confusion. (REBNY has since updated its rules to require, not just suggest, the use of buyer agreements.)\nAccess the comprehensive data set supporting this ranking\nhere\n.\nTRD Data\np\nuts the power of real data in your hands.\nThe new dev ebb\nNew development accounts for less than a quarter of the city\u2019s sales, but the industry often looks to the latest crop of building launches as a market bellwether.\nThe only problem? Sponsor launches were few and far between.\nThe buildings that did launch \u2014 projects like the Reuben Brothers\u2019 hotel-condo boutique the Surrey or Mickey Rabina\u2019s 100-unit supertall at 520 Fifth Avenue \u2014 sold fast in the inventory-constrained environment.\nSerhant\u2019s Kayla Lee, who led sales at The Huron, raised prices 13 times at one of Greenpoint\u2019s only new luxury buildings. The building also set the neighborhood price record with a $5.7 million penthouse sale and the neighborhood price per square foot record at unit 7C, which sold for over $2,700 a foot.\nOne of the year\u2019s top-performing buildings, Steve Witkoff\u2019s rebranded One High Line, topped $1 billion in sales and was an example of a languishing property having its moment in the sun with a resurgence of buyers.\nCorcoran\u2019s Deborah Kern and Steve Gold, who topped the new development rankings, have been leading sales there, along with Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group.\n\u201cInventory has been slowly getting absorbed,\u201d said Elliman\u2019s Jade Chan, who is leading sales at the Mandarin Oriental. \u201cOver the past 10 years of new development, we obviously had such a big boom, and now it\u2019s starting to dwindle down.\u201d\nNearly every agent notching new development sales in 2024 talked about developers getting realistic with pricing.\n\u201cThe ones that sell are the ones that get more reasonable and serious about pricing,\u201d said Shlomi Reuveni, who took over sales at 77 Greenwich in 2024 and 25 Broad Street in 2023.\nReuveni and Lee both pointed to not even entertaining projects with aspirational pricing \u2014 something that might have worked 10 years ago, but not in 2024.\n\u201cWe actually walk away from a lot of deals when the seller is very adamant about getting a price that we just don\u2019t think is realistic,\u201d Lee said.\nOutlook for next year\nLooking to the months ahead, brokers and their executives largely projected confidence, though they acknowledged that the wave of new policy from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is adding a layer of uncertainty.\n\u201cThings have been looking really good,\u201d Liebman said. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously nervousness around some of the potential new policies and the little shakiness in the stock market, but according to my agents, the mood is still pretty good out there.\u201d\nBut others were more hesitant. While Elliman\u2019s Eklund-Gomes team\u2019s pre-development business is surging in the new year as developers start to move forward with the early stages of new projects, the team\u2019s co-founder John Gomes said buyers and sellers are surely disoriented by the year\u2019s constant news cycle.\n\u201cWhen you get whiplash, it makes you dizzy. When you get dizzy, you\u2019re unstable,\u201d Gomes said. \u201cThe market is not stable.\u201d\nWith instability at the forefront, Gomes said he doesn\u2019t know where 2025 will fall.\n\u201cI have to say, my crystal ball is foggy, and it\u2019s usually not.\u201d\nAccess the comprehensive data set supporting this ranking\nhere\n.\nTRD Data\np\nuts the power of real data in your hands.",

The building, called Midtown Park Residences by Proper, will mark the first of six buildings on the nearly 5-acre site at 3055 North Miami Avenue, Rosso said.\nWalmart sold the property to Vadia\u2019s Midtown Development for $26.4 million\nin 2019\n.\nRosso\nand\nVadia\nplan a $2 billion mixed-use development with four residential towers and two office buildings, more than 120,000 square feet of retail space, a public racquet court and padel club, and a 25,000-square-foot gym.\nRosso called the property a \u201cconnector site\u201d with heavy pedestrian use from the Miami Design District to Wynwood. He has worked with Vadia in the past, when he was an executive at the Related Group and more recently at\nStandard Residences\nMidtown Miami a block away.

It\u2019s really the hole in the doughnut.\u201d\nMidtown\nstands out from other neighborhoods because of the way it\u2019s been designed, with all street-level, ground-floor retail and glass entrances, and green space.

Single men follow.\u201d\n\nBrian De Lowe, co-founder and president of Santa Monica, California-based Proper, said the firm was attracted to the neighborhood\u2019s walkability. His partner Brad Korzen previously led Viceroy Hotels.\nIn Austin, Texas, the company branded the Austin Proper Hotel and Residences, where condo sales set city records at about $3,000 per square foot, beating Four Seasons and W Residences, De Lowe said.\nUnits at Midtown Park Residences by Proper will range from the low $700,000s to $2.7 million, excluding penthouses. Edgardo Defortuna\u2019s Fortune Development Sales is leading sales of the project. Units will range from studios to three-bedroom condos, from 510 square feet to 1,730 square feet. The penthouses will average 3,150 square feet and will include private rooftop terraces with gardens and private pools.\nThe developers launched sales to friends and family last week and have about 25 reservations.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great in a market that\u2019s so competitive,\u201d Rosso said.\nOwners will be limited to renting their units out at most three times a year, for a minimum period of four months. Residents will also have access to the Shelborne Hotel by Proper in Miami Beach, which is expected to open this spring following a renovation.\nArquitectonica, Meyer Davis Studio and Naturalficial are designing the project, which will include 40,000 square feet of amenities, a pool deck and a 7,000-square-foot lobby with a well-known cafe that also sells books, likely Books &amp; Books.\nConstruction on the first building could begin in about a year and be completed in 2028, Rosso said.\n",

        "content": "Noah Properties scored a $42.5 million refinancing from Walker &amp; Dunlop, despite wading into a tight lending environment constricted by high interest rates.\nThe loan is backed by the recently completed Encore at the Grove Apartments, a 120-unit senior living complex for adults aged 55 and up. The debt amounts to 354,000 per unit.\nThe apartments are the third and final phase of a 22-acre multifamily community in the Chicago suburb of River Grove. The first two phases of the development consisted of 162 multifamily units and 85 built-to-rent townhomes. The project also got funding assistance from tax increment financing set aside by the Village of River Grove.\nArrow Real Estate Advisors served as the debt broker for Noah Properties and locked down the loan last month. The financing was completed by Arrow founder and managing partner Morris Betesh as well as Jacob Petrovic and Omar Ferreira.\n\nMultifamily development\nhas served as a bright spot\nin Chicago\u2019s commercial real estate market, which is still struggling to rebound from the pandemic. Office vacancy has been stuck around 25 percent, and several megadevelopments have stalled, including Sterling Bay\u2019s Lincoln Yard\u2019s life sciences campus. Bank OZK is seizing the northern segment of the proposed $6 million 53-acre development through deed in lieu of foreclosure.\nBut demand for market rate and luxury multifamily is growing due to the city\u2019s large population of college-educated residents, diverse job market and virtually nonexistent incoming multifamily pipeline.\nWith The Grove project, Noah Properties was facing an additional hurdle of seeking investment in Cook County. Real estate investors have expressed more confidence in counties surrounding Cook County because their property tax systems are\ngenerally perceived as more predictable.\nIn Cook County, the property tax system is undergoing significant overhaul under Assessor Fritz Kaegi that\nis ruffling feathers among the commercial real estate community\n.\nMarket uncertainty hasn\u2019t slowed Chicago-based Noah Properties, which in the last six months\nhas listed a 237-unit multifamily development in Northwest Chicago\nand received approval to build\na 24-unit apartment building in Wicker Park\n.\n",

Dozens have been successful.\nAt least 60 municipalities negotiated compromises with the Fair Share Housing Center to reduce affordable housing targets, Gothamist\nreported\n. That represents about a third of the towns that requested lowered allotments. The Fair Share Housing Center contested 67 municipalities that petitioned to reduce their targets.\n\u201cThis process has worked far better than I would\u2019ve even anticipated,\u201d Fair Share Housing Center executive director Adam Gordon told the publication.\nThe decreased targets have appeared in court dockets for 15 municipalities so far. Those towns combined to lower their targets by more than 1,400 units, though none of the individual towns received as drastic a reduction as each wanted. Roxbury saw the biggest drop of the 15, a target drop from 989 units to 499 units; it requested an obligation of 358 units.\nTowns are negotiating targets laid out for 2025 to 2035 with the nonprofit. A panel of retired judges is overseeing the negotiations, which began in earnest in October after the Department of Community Affairs released its requirements for every state municipality.\n\nLitigation is on the table for towns that don\u2019t agree to their numbers or find a settlement with the nonprofit.\nIn February, the New Jersey Builders Association\nfiled a lawsuit\nagainst every town attempting to reduce the number of affordable homes they need to build. Those municipalities are looking to reduce the number of affordable housing units they need to build by a combined 14,000 units, according to the complaint.\nNew Jersey officials are seeking to add 85,000 affordable housing units to the state over the next decade; municipalities are tasked with adding an average of 150 units, though the exact number differs across towns.\nMunicipalities need to deliver their affordable housing plans by the end of June.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s have also lowered the company\u2019s rating.\nFitch analysts flagged \u201cexecution risk\u201d on Bally\u2019s planned $1.7 billion permanent casino at 777 West Chicago Avenue in River West, pointing to a crowded local gambling market and high taxes, plus the usual strain of a major casino rollout.\nThe project\u2019s plans call for a 500-room hotel, entertainment venues, restaurants and public spaces.\nBally\u2019s appears to have enough funding to complete the project slated to open in September 2026, Fitch said. But the lower rating could make it harder and more expensive for the company to borrow money moving forward.\nBally\u2019s secured\n$940 million in private financing\nlast year to plug a construction funding gap, at the time hushing doubts surrounding the project.\nBut it has since\nfaced delays\nin launching a planned $250 million initial public offering. The IPO was to satisfy an agreement with the city of Chicago that at least a quarter of the casino\u2019s equity be held by minority and women investors.\n\nThe IPO, a centerpiece of Bally\u2019s equity strategy, has not received approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission, and it is tied up in litigation from conservative groups who claim it is discriminatory.\nThe company has instead\nbegun selling $195 million in private shares\nwhile continuing efforts to relaunch the minority investment vehicle.\nBally\u2019s has also applied for a property tax incentive that\ncould save it up to $300 million\nover 10 years, though the proposal has stalled at City Hall.\nMeanwhile, revenue from Bally\u2019s temporary\nMedinah Temple casino\ncontinues to fall short of expectations.\nThe casino brought in under $8.8 million in February, the lowest monthly haul in more than a year, amid competition from Wind Creek\u2019s\nsouth suburban casino\n.\nReturns remain below projections, but customer interest is growing in the future permanent site, Bally\u2019s CEO Robeson Reeves said in a recent report.\nA credit upgrade could still be in play for Bally\u2019s if it secures more solid funding commitments for its Chicago casino, Fitch said.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "ACS Group is planning a $2.16 billion data center campus in Fort Worth, one of the largest such investments in North Texas to date.\nThe proposed four-building project from the Madrid-based construction company\u2019s American arm, Turner Construction, would span 107 acres near Hicks Field Road and an Oncor power substation, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe development would have two phases, with full completion expected by 2034. If approved, it would bring 37 permanent jobs with average annual salaries of $150,000.\nACS is one of the world\u2019s largest construction firms and the top data center builder in the United States, with a data center client list featuring tech giants Meta, Google, Microsoft and Apple. Turner Construction has already managed major projects in the region, such as DFW Airport\u2019s Terminal F expansion and TCU\u2019s $101 million football stadium upgrade.\nFort Worth\u2019s economic development department is negotiating a 10-year tax abatement to incentivize the deal.\nThe proposal includes a 35 percent property tax break during the first phase, and then 70 percent on business personal property, such as equipment, in the second phase. The department estimates the city would recoup the value of the tax breaks in just over three years.\nCity staff emphasized the importance of selecting data center projects with solid financial backing, strong anchor tenants and proximity to critical infrastructure, including substations and energy storage systems. The tax break structure is designed to prevent speculative development of shell buildings without active data center operations.\n\nTo qualify for the incentives, ACS would need to invest at least $481.6 million in property improvements and $1.68 billion in equipment, while also meeting hiring and construction benchmarks. If those goals aren\u2019t met, the tax benefits could be scaled back or revoked.\nThe plan could still evolve, but ACS intends to leave space for future residential development adjacent to the site.\nThe Fort Worth City Council is expected to vote on the agreement on April 8. It would further cement Fort Worth\u2019s place as a hotbed for data center growth, driven by cheap land, affordable energy and rising demand from hyperscale operators.\nThe only recent investment to top ACS\u2019 proposal came from a local player. Dallas-based Prime Data Centers is working on a\n$3 billion project\nto deliver three two-story facilities in southwest Fort Worth and three more in the Dallas suburb of Garland.\nGoogle pledged to invest $1 billion into its Texas data center portfolio, which includes data centers in\nMidlothian and Red Oak\nand a\n1.1-million-square-foot facility\nat Majestic Realty\u2019s Silver Creek Business Park in Fort Worth. But the tech giant ended up\nditching its Fort Worth complex\nin Northlake, which it spent $20 million to build, in February.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "The Moinians and the Katzes have spent 15 years quarreling over an apartment building in the Financial District, a dispute likened to one of American folklore\u2019s most infamous family feuds.\nNow, Joe Moinian and his brother are on the verge of losing 90 Washington Street, a 1970s-era brick office building that they took over in the wake of 9/11 via a hundred-million-dollar ground lease and converted into 396 apartments.\nGary Katz\u2019s family, which owns the ground under the building and leases the property to the Moinians, argued they failed to properly fix safety issues with the brick facade and violated their lease.\nIn the years they\u2019ve been squabbling over the facade, a neighboring developer built and completely sold out a condo tower nearly twice the size of 90 Washington right next door \u2014 a foil to the futility of their disagreements.\n\u201cThe core issue is the inability of the parties, plaintiff and defendant \u2014 The Moinians and the Katzes; sounds like the Hatfields and the McCoys with a Jewish hint. . .\u00a0 to arrive at a mutually agreed to path to complete the fa\u00e7ade renovations,\u201d Edward Klein, an attorney for Moinian, said at a trial in June. \u201cBoth sides have tried, but they haven\u2019t succeeded.\u201d\nKatz, however, told a judge that there\u2019s no personal enmity between him and Moinian.\n\u201cWe actually have a very fine personal relationship outside of a significant business conflict,\u201d he said.\nFollowing a nine-day trial last year, a court found Moinian violated his ground lease. Last month, a judge appointed a receiver to take over the property and prepare it for a foreclosure sale.\nThe Katzes\nGary is the son of\nDaniel P. Katz\n, a parking-lot executive who in the 1960s and \u201870s bought up unwanted properties in Manhattan.\n\u201cMy dad had no capital or ability to borrow when he started building his parking business and had his lots mostly on month-to-month leases, so he would offer to demolish existing buildings in exchange for a longer-term lease to operate the site as a parking lot,\u201d\nGary explained\nin an interview with the website FoPro.\nGary, who invests through his White Plains-based family office Downtown Capital Partners, said that his father didn\u2019t have the cash to put money down on properties, so he would rely on seller financing.\nBut Daniel\u2019s main business was operating parking lots, and when he died of suicide in 1987 at the age 48, there were no set plans in place to run the more than\n30 buildings\nhe had accumulated. When the recession hit in the early 1980s, the Katzes \u2014 Gary, his mother, Rosalie and his two sisters, Meredith and Wendy \u2014 had to sell most of their properties at rock-bottom prices.\nOne property they kept was 90 Washington Street, which was developed into a 27-story office building in 1970 and served as the back offices for Bank of New York Mellon. In the aftermath of 9/11, the building was empty and the Katzes were looking for someone to help them find a solution.\nEnter: The Moinians\nJoe Moinian\n, meanwhile, had started converting old office buildings into apartments in 1998 with the 221-unit 100 John Street, which is just a few blocks west of 90 Washington.\nAs he became more active in FiDi, he and his brother David acquired the long-term ground lease on 90 Washington in 2003 and spent two years converting it into apartments at a cost of $135 million \u2014 about $30 million of which the brothers funded themselves.\nThis is where things start to get complicated.\nIn 2003, he negotiated an amendment to the lease; Moinian testified that he negotiated this change with Gary\u2019s mother, but Rosalie Katz had been diagnosed with terminal cancer the year before, and the Katzes\u2019 attorneys insisted Gary was at the table.\nRecognizing the costly expenses of converting and maintaining the building, Katz offered Moinian a below-market price on the ground lease. In exchange, he negotiated conditions that his attorney said were completely unprecedented: They required that any major capital improvements Moinan made to the property be done in a \u201cworkmanlike manner with materials of the same class and quality as the original,\u201d and specified that the developer provide the Katzes with plans from an architect approved by the family.\n\nThe Dispute\nThose conditions would start coming into play in 2010 when the Department of Buildings issued a notice saying that 90 Washington was unsafe and in violation of Local Law 11 due to cracked and shifting bricks in the facade.\nMoinian came up with a plan to fix the problem, but instead of replacing the damaged masonry and joints, he opted to clad the building with 1,200 aluminum panels.\nBut the project dragged on as work started and stopped.\nIn the more than 14 years that Moinian worked on the facade, Francis Greenburger\u2019s Time Equities developed an entire 64-story condo building from the ground up next door at 50 West Street.\n\u201cMoinian could have built eight to ten Empire State Buildings in the time this facade has taken,\u201d said Joshua Bernstein, an attorney for the Katzes at Akerman.\nKatz accused Moinian of cutting corners and doing slipshod work, trying to milk the building for profits.\nOne of the issues may have been the developer\u2019s financing. Moinian used low-cost Liberty Bonds available for downtown development projects after 9/11 and tapped the state\u2019s 421g program, which reduced taxes for conversions for a period of 12 years.\nIn the early years, the building had financed lots of cash and was hugely profitable. But after 15 years, the debt payments on the Liberty Bonds began amortizing, and other expenses began to rise.\n\u201cAs time went on, the annual net rental payments increased, the tax abatements and other exemptions expired and the payments related to the Liberty Bonds increased, leaving plaintiff in a more cash-neutral position, at best,\u201d Katz wrote in an affidavit.\nIn August 2018, Katz notified Moinian that his work on the facade violated the terms of the ground lease and sent a 30-day notice to cure before he planned to terminate the lease. The two sides extended the cure period 19 times but eventually hit a wall. On the day before the final extension was set to expire, Moinian went to the court to obtain a Yellowstone injunction preventing his landlord from terminating the lease while he tried to cure the violation.\nMoinan\u2019s attorneys said that Katz\u2019s real motivation behind the litigation was that he was unsatisfied with the sweetheart deal he had agreed to.\n\u201cLandlord\u2019s concession in the affidavit of its principal, Gary Katz, that the rents it is currently receiving are substantially below market, shows the landlord\u2019s true motivation in serving the notice to cure, which is to harass tenant and to wrongfully force tenant out of its valuable leasehold,\u201d they wrote in court filings.\nAs a lengthy and costly legal battle loomed, Moinian agreed to open up about 200 panels on the building and allow engineers to inspect the work underneath. But opening the panels damages them and they usually are thrown away and replaced, Moinian said. So he stopped.\n\u201cI thought that opening the panels, there\u2019s no good reason to do that anymore,\u201d he testified at trial. \u201cIt made absolutely no economic sense.\u201d\nManhattan supreme court judge Nicholas Moyne cited that testimony in September when he ruled that Moinian had breached the lease agreement for failing to get Katz\u2019s approval for the project and fixing the safety violations.\n(It also didn\u2019t help Moinian\u2019s case that he submitted an affidavit to the court in July 2021 that the work was complete but later admitted in June that the project still wasn\u2019t finished.)\nMoyne wrote in his ruling that Moinian made a business decision to not correct the work on the upper part of the building.\n\u201cIt is entirely possible that had [the engineer\u2019s] original design plan for the panel project been allowed to come to fruition, the building\u2019s facade would be considered safe by now,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHowever, the tenant did not allow this, thus the lease was breached.\u201d\nBreaching the lease put Moinian in default on his mortgage, and in February, Fannie Mae \u2014 which holds the $75 million in Liberty Bonds he used on the project \u2014 filed to foreclose. A federal judge on March 21 appointed a receiver to take over the building and hire a broker to market it for sale.\n",

It started\nin October\nby selling off 44 vacant lots in Lawndale for $1 a piece for development of owner-occupied multifamily.\nThe collective estimated value of the city-owned properties in this round is $26 million, according to Johnson\u2019s office. Applications are due by either May 15 or June 30, depending on the parcel.\nThe 54 lots are grouped into 11 clusters across Morgan Park, Chatham and South Chicago. The city may offer them at just $1 per lot, with up to $150,000 in financial assistance per unit for qualifying developers, aiming to incentivize projects that offer long-term affordability.\nSome properties are being offered at below-market prices based on proposed use, while others will be sold at market rate for vertical construction, Planning Commissioner Ciere Boatright said.\nThe parcels include large redevelopment opportunities, such as an 8.2-acre tract at 1924 West 46th Street in the Stockyards Industrial Corridor. Valued at $3.3 million, the site is being marketed for commercial uses like retail, restaurants and grocery stores.\n\nThe program designates 33 lots for urban agriculture, 48 lots for affordable housing and 148 lots for market-rate housing, the Chicago Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe Department of Planning and Development has gradually rolled out incentives for residential builders to deliver more attainable housing between subsidized and luxury price points, the so-called \u201cmissing middle.\u201d\nThe city owns about 10,000 parcels of land, primarily on the South and West sides, that it has acquired through foreclosure due to demolition liens, Cook County\u2019s tax scavenger sales, property condemnation and occasional direct purchases, among other means, according to its website. Many of the properties have been part of the city\u2019s holdings since the early 1980s.\nThere are 375 lots marked as\naccepting applications\n.\nBy targeting affordable housing developers and private builders, the initiative seeks to balance revenue generation with broader neighborhood revitalization. City officials hope the latest offering will accelerate investment in underserved communities while also helping stabilize Chicago\u2019s tax base.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

Then it\nreversed course\n.\n\nA few hours later, the federal agency replaced it with a\npaired down list\nof eight properties it planned to sell, none in California.\nThis week, the GSA added eight properties to its list, including the Richmond property and buildings in New Mexico, Oklahoma, Illinois, Utah, Wisconsin and Iowa.\nSuch \u201cnoncore\u201d assets cost more than $430 million to operate and maintain each year, an unidentified spokesperson from GSA told the Business Times last month.\nThe Biden administration had also sought to sell the Richmond building in 2023, along with 23 other properties. It said it wanted to update its federal real estate portfolio to benefit local communities and taxpayers.\nThe Frank Hagel Federal Building takes up 87 percent of the city\u2019s 667,853-square-foot office market in Richmond, according to the Business Times.\nOffice vacancy in the East Bay city was 14.9 percent in the fourth quarter, according to CBRE.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "In a blow to the Real Estate Board of New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul has joined forces with a progressive New York politician and backed the city\u2019s fight against a lawsuit challenging the broker fee bill.\n\u201cI know what state law says, and it does not interfere with Chi Oss\u00e9\u2019s FARE Act,\u201d Hochul says in\na video\nwith the City Council member, posted on social media, referring to the Fairness in Apartment Rental Expenses Act. \u201cThe court should rule in favor of the city, and these broker fees? They should end forever.\u201d\nState officials on Friday filed an amicus brief supporting the city against a lawsuit filed by the Real Estate Board of New York. The brief argues that the state has a \u201cstrong interest in ensuring that state law is not improperly interpreted to invalidate tenant-protective local laws like the FARE Act.\u201d\n\u201cAt this point, the only opinion on the FARE Act that matters is that of the federal courts,\u201d a spokesperson for REBNY said in a statement. \u201cWe remain confident in the merits of our legal arguments and look forward to our day in court.\u201d\nREBNY\u2019s lawsuit argued that the FARE Act, which requires landlords to pay for rental brokers they hire, is preempted by state law, specifically \u201ca comprehensive regime of laws governing the compensation of real estate brokers and salespersons.\u201d\nState officials maintain that state law doesn\u2019t cover every aspect of residential brokerage.\n\u201cIt does not dictate, with any intent to occupy an entire sphere of oversight, how a broker earns or can claim entitlement to a commission\u2014the issue that the FARE Act primarily regulates,\u201d the amicus brief states.\nThe City Council approved the FARE Act in November. The measure requires landlords to pay brokers who they hire, rather than forcing tenants to pick up the tab, which in many cases is 15 percent of the first year\u2019s rent. REBNY has argued that landlords will shift these costs to renters by increasing rent (though they can\u2019t do so at stabilized properties). REBNY also raised concerns that, under the law, a broker who advertises a rental is assumed to have been hired by the landlord.\n\nThe group filed a\nlawsuit\nto block the law in December and then sought a\npreliminary injunction\nto prevent the law from going into effect in June. The city filed a motion to dismiss the case in February. These motions have not yet been decided.\nIn the video, Council member Oss\u00e9 described the lawsuit as big real estate\u2019s \u201cone last desperate play.\u201d\nThe governor\u2019s cameo in the video is somewhat surprising. It is not unusual for elected officials to side with renters, a significant constituency in New York. But just a few months ago, Hochul\npraised\nREBNY at the trade group\u2019s annual event. In fact, REBNY President Jim Whelan spoke after the governor and brought up the group\u2019s fight against the FARE Act.\nDuring the video, the governor plugged a refrain she has used as part of her affordability agenda this year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time you got a break and kept more money in your pockets,\u201d she said in the video.\nThe New York State Tenant Bloc\nresponded\nto the video on social media platform X, calling on the governor to support a state-run voucher program in the state budget. Hochul has said such a program would be too\ncostly\n.\n",

The identities of the buyer and seller were not disclosed.\nThe seven-acre property hit the market last summer with an asking price of $89 million.

That property also saw its share of discounts, initially listed for $85 million and featuring an\nask of $49.5 million\nwhen it went into contract.\nThe biggest sale of 2024 was for Southampton\u2019s La Dune, which\nsold for $79 million\nat auction.\nThere were no nine-figure sales in 2024, and just one deal above $50 million, according to\nanalysis by The Real Deal\n.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Ross isn\u2019t the only real estate player backing the project with a donation:\nFrisbie Group\nmanaging partner and Vanderbilt alum Cody Crowell pledged $5 million, according to a press release.\nThe news comes six months after the Nashville-based university won approval to build the\n$520 million West Palm Beach campus\ndedicated to business and tech graduate programs.\nRenderings\nreleased in February showed two planned buildings, an \u201cAcademic and Innovation Building\u201d and an \u201cExecutive Education and Lifelong Learning Building.\u201d\nThe planned campus is meant to serve 1,000 students with 200 full-time employees within the first five years of opening, according to the school\u2019s development and conveyance agreement (DCA) with Palm Beach County.\n\nTime is of the essence for the project\u2019s fundraising. According to the DCA, Vanderbilt must begin construction within five years of the agreement\u2019s approval. The university has a $10.2 billion endowment, the\nVanderbilt Hustler\nreported in February, but the Trump administration\u2019s threats to pull federal funding for higher education institutions loom large.\nRoss, chairman of Related Ross and Palm Beach County\u2019s most prolific developer, has campaigned to bring the university to West Palm Beach as part of his grand vision for the city\u2019s future as an innovation hub and center of American commerce. Ross has sought to attract major institutions, like\nWall Street\nand the\nCleveland Clinic\n, to the city in his mission to build the new West Palm Beach. He also pledged $50 million to the Cleveland Clinic for its planned West Palm Beach campus, equating to 10 percent of its $500 million goal, according to published reports. His commitment to Vanderbilt represents 16.7 percent of the university\u2019s total fundraising goal, with $223 million left to go.\nRoss started fundraising for the school last year, hosting an event at his personal home in Palm Beach,\nBloomberg\nreported at the time.\nRoss has attempted to woo other elite educational institutions to Palm Beach County. He and other local business leaders\nhave courted private schools\nfrom the Northeast, with the aim to open South Florida outposts. So far, none have taken the leap, and Ross is now planning to\nbuild a private school in West Palm Beach, himself\n.",

Like the rest of the complex project, the proposed affordable housing component is tied to Cohen\u2019s victory in the casino sweepstakes, in which he is vying for one of three gaming licenses.\n\u201cWe are thrilled to bring our deep expertise in affordable housing to this collaboration,\u201d Slate principal David Schwartz said in a statement.\nThe housing wouldn\u2019t actually be built at the $8 billion Metropolitan Park site. Instead, it would be erected at a parking lot at 54-19 100th Street in Corona, two miles away and next to another affordable housing development.\nThe project would include community space, on-site parking, an outdoor area and a children\u2019s playground. The income eligibility will range for the affordable housing, but the units would stay affordable for at least 60 years.\nThis is the second big move made by Cohen regarding his casino plan in the last few days.\n\nOver the weekend, State Sen. John Liu announced that\nhe would sponsor\na parkland alienation bill for the proposed casino complex west of Citi Field, despite representing a minority of the acreage covered by the Metropolitan Park plan.\nCohen and Hard Rock have a binding agreement to fund $100 million in infrastructure upgrades to Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. The larger proposal includes a hotel, live music venue, food hall and 20 acres of public park space, but Cohen has said he won\u2019t build any of the project without the coveted gaming license.\nWith less than three months to go until the deadline, bidders for the gaming licenses are finding more chips to push into the pot. The Soloviev Group and Mohegan recently announced the support of a coalition of 26 New York labor organizations and workforce development partners, including the Hotel and Gaming Trades Council.\nApplications for the three licenses are due near the end of June.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The department estimates the city would recoup the value of the tax breaks in just over three years.\nCity staff emphasized the importance of selecting data center projects with solid financial backing, strong anchor tenants and proximity to critical infrastructure, including substations and energy storage systems. The tax break structure is designed to prevent speculative development of shell buildings without active data center operations.\n\nTo qualify for the incentives, ACS would need to invest at least $481.6 million in property improvements and $1.68 billion in equipment, while also meeting hiring and construction benchmarks. If those goals aren\u2019t met, the tax benefits could be scaled back or revoked.\nThe plan could still evolve, but ACS intends to leave space for future residential development adjacent to the site.\nThe Fort Worth City Council is expected to vote on the agreement on April 8. It would further cement Fort Worth\u2019s place as a hotbed for data center growth, driven by cheap land, affordable energy and rising demand from hyperscale operators.\nThe only recent investment to top ACS\u2019 proposal came from a local player. Dallas-based Prime Data Centers is working on a\n$3 billion project\nto deliver three two-story facilities in southwest Fort Worth and three more in the Dallas suburb of Garland.\nGoogle pledged to invest $1 billion into its Texas data center portfolio, which includes data centers in\nMidlothian and Red Oak\nand a\n1.1-million-square-foot facility\nat Majestic Realty\u2019s Silver Creek Business Park in Fort Worth. But the tech giant ended up\nditching its Fort Worth complex\nin Northlake, which it spent $20 million to build, in February.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "The battle for control over the 92-acre Ziggurat property in Laguna Niguel has taken an unexpected twist \u2014 an alleged attempt at collusion by a winning bidder.\nJeff Pintar of Pintar Investment and Cameron Hildreth of Hilco Development Services plunked down a $17.7 million deposit after\nwinning a federal auction last fall\nfor the 1-million-square-foot Chet Holifield Federal Building at 24000 Avila Road,\nthe Orange County Business Journal reported\n.\nTo close the deal, they must pay the remaining $160 million by April 24.\nThe Business Journal reports that the losing bidder was Newport Beach-based Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian, which has been more than vocal about its loss.\nHoag filed a lawsuit in November against the U.S. General Services Administration, alleging Pintar violated auction rules by proposing a collusive deal to end the bidding process early. Hoag claimed Pintar asked if they wanted to \u201cwork together instead of against each other.\u201d\nThe hospital refused and later argued that Pintar should have been disqualified.\nDespite these allegations, Hoag recently requested the lawsuit\u2019s dismissal, which was granted on March 20. Executives from Hoag, Pintar, and Hilco declined to comment. The GSA has yet to finalize the sale and hasn\u2019t disclosed the buyer\u2019s identity or their plans for the site.\n\nThe $177 million purchase price works out to $1.9 million per acre \u2014 a bargain compared to nearby land values. Pintar remains confident he will meet the financial deadline.\nIf he fails, the deposit is forfeited, and GSA could seek alternative buyers \u2014 potentially giving Hoag another opportunity.\nThe competition for healthcare expansion in South County is fierce. Since MemorialCare closed its San Clemente hospital in 2016, providers have raced to fill the void. Providence Mission is investing $712 million in new facilities, while Hoag is spending $1 billion on Irvine expansions and $20 million on a new 20,000-square-foot health center in San Clemente, set to open in July.\nHoag aims to have a healthcare facility within 10 minutes of every Orange County household, making the Ziggurat property a strategic acquisition. The hospital\u2019s chairperson, Robert Brunswick, is co-founder of Buchanan Partners, a major real estate investment firm.\nThe five-month bidding war for the Ziggurat began at\n$70 million\nin June, with 157 bids submitted before\nPintar\u2019s final offer\n.\nIf Pintar and Hildreth proceed with their acquisition, they plan a mixed-use redevelopment featuring office, residential and retail space, potentially including a hospital with the right partner. If their bid falters, Hoag may still have a shot at securing the prime real estate.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "Even without the natural disasters driving home insurance hikes in other states, homeowners across Illinois are paying significantly more to protect their properties.\nHome insurance premiums in Illinois soared 50 percent between 2021 and 2024, the second-largest increase in the country after Utah\u2019s 59 percent jump, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n, citing data from the Consumer Federation of America.\nThe spike far exceeds the national average of 24 percent over the same period.\nThe increase brings the average annual premium for an Illinois home with a $350,000 replacement value to $2,942, up $974 in just three years. It puts the state at 20th nationwide for total cost. Premiums in the Chicago metro rose 46 percent, though homeowners in rural parts of the country now pay even more on average than those in urban areas.\nRising costs for building materials and labor, as well as relaxed state-level oversight, are fueling the surge.\nIllinois hasn\u2019t faced major disasters like wildfires or hurricanes, but unlike California and Florida, its regulators don\u2019t have the authority to deny premium increases. In Illinois, homeowners are only notified once the hikes take effect.\n\nThe situation is drawing scrutiny from lawmakers and consumer advocates. Illinois state Sen. Christina Castro has introduced legislation that would give the Department of Insurance power to approve or deny future increases.\nThe regulatory system has a \u201cgaping hole\u201d in consumer protection, and Illinois should offer residents the same safeguards found in nearly every other state, said Abe Scarr, director of the Illinois Public Interest Research Group.\nWithout intervention, many homeowners may be forced to accept worse coverage, pay higher deductibles or even drop insurance altogether. The consumer federation warned that escalating rates are already pushing millions of Americans in that direction.\nRising operating costs are squeezing consumers and insurers alike. State Farm and Allstate have requested rate increases of more than 12 percent in the past year.\nInsurers in some states are pulling out altogether, but Illinois remains a battleground for how regulators and lawmakers respond to mounting pressure from both sides, as well as how much relief, if any, is on the horizon for homeowners.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

Not so fast, city officials say.\nThe unincorporated South Bay town has filed a lawsuit seeking clarification as to whether developers can continuously refile incomplete applications for builder\u2019s remedy projects,\nthe San Jose Mercury News reported\n.\nBuilder\u2019s remedy, a provision in state housing law, allows developers to bypass zoning in cities or counties that fail to certify their state housing plans, provided they include 20 percent affordable housing.\nThe town is now processing 12 or 13 builder\u2019s remedy applications, according to Los Gatos Mayor Matthew Hudes.\n\u201cThe purpose of this lawsuit is not to stop housing construction in Los Gatos, but rather to know how to comply with the law,\u201d the city stated in a news release.\nDevelopers have 180 days after submitting a preliminary application to submit a full application for a builder\u2019s remedy housing project, or their preliminary application will expire, according to state housing law.\nAfter that, they have 90 days to resolve any missing pieces in their applications.\nLos Gatos interpreted the law to mean that there was only one 90-day period in which developers can resolve any issues with their applications.\nBut the state Department of Housing and Community Development says a developer can have successive 90-day periods to fix their applications, which could run indefinitely. The department also threatened to get the state attorney general to enforce its interpretation.\n\nHudes said clarifying the law would make sure the town can efficiently approve builder\u2019s remedy applications to make way for much-needed housing. It\u2019s not clear how, if the city has been holding up the builder\u2019s remedy projects, further clarification could further expedite them.\n\u201cThis action is necessary to protect the interests of our town and provide much-needed clarity,\u201d Hudes said in a release. \u201cBy seeking the court\u2019s help, we aim to avoid further confusion and ensure that the town\u2019s actions are consistent with the law.\n\u201cWithout resolution of this issue, applications could remain incomplete indefinitely, which would only delay the construction of much-needed housing.\u201d\nAfter the Los Gatos Town Council approved its state-mandated plan to allow for 1,993 homes by 2031 last summer, the municipality faced 15 qualified builder\u2019s remedy projects. The wealthy town south of San Jose approved its state-mandated housing element in June last year \u2014 17 months after the January 2023 deadline.\nThe window of noncompliance left Los Gatos open to the builder\u2019s remedy.\nThe projects include the proposed conversion of the Post Office at 101 South Santa Cruz Avenue into a seven-story, 58-unit condominium complex and a plan by locally based Arya Properties to replace an Ace Hardware store at 15300 Los Gatos Boulevard with a\nnine-story, 182-unit apartment complex.\nThe clarification sought by the town lawsuit was raised when applications for two builder\u2019s remedy projects were deemed incomplete, with the developers asserting that they had unlimited time to resolve them.\nThe contested projects include the redevelopment of the\nAce Hardware\nand a proposal by Grosvenor Property Americas for the next phase of\nNorth 40\ndevelopment, with\n437 homes\n, at the corner of Highways 17 and 85.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "The 242-unit luxury tower at 130 William Street is known for its distinctive arched windows, concrete facade and booming sales.\nBut workers in the Lightstone Group\u2019s Lower Manhattan building argue it\u2019s not yet known for providing fair wages or proper benefits.\nThe 12 building employees, who won a union election in 2023, rallied in front of the building yesterday in support of their demands at the bargaining table.\nKevin Stavris, 32BJ SEIU executive vice president, said the 130 William workers are looking for a contract that provides the \u201csame standards as the rest of our members in the city,\u201d which include industry-standard wages, high-quality health insurance and retirement benefits.\nLightstone Group did not immediately return a request for comment.\nThe property is over 90 percent sold, with units trading for over $2,000 per square foot, making it one of the Financial District\u2019s\nfew bright spots in an otherwise sluggish luxury market in the area.\nThe building launched sales in 2018 and was declared effective at the end of 2019. As of the end of last year, the five-person condo board was made up of three sponsor members and two resident members.\n\nThe city-wide union has added 500 to 600 residential members each year to its ranks, according to Stavris. It represents over 35,000 members across more than 3,000 buildings across the city.\nThe union, which won a new contract in 2022 with the Realty Advisory Board, represents workers across residential duties, from affordable housing maintenance employees to porters and doormen at Billionaires\u2019 Row supertalls.\nIn 2022, condo boards and property management companies prepared for the worst as negotiations plodded along. The new contract guaranteed workers 12.6 percent wage increases over its four years, along with 100 percent employer-paid healthcare and paid sick and vacation leave.\nThe contract is set to expire in 2026.\nLast year, workers at the Jardim condo on 527 West 27th Street in West Chelsea went on a 24-hour labor strike over the condo board allegedly cancelling their health insurance without notice. Two weeks later, employees at 56 Pine Street walked off the job after layoffs, according to a release from the union.\nStavris said employees at 130 William have spent the past two years at the bargaining table, but that he doesn\u2019t have a timeline for when a contract will be struck.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to do what we need to do to get an agreement,\u201d he said.\n",

        "content": "The Durst Organization gave $100,000 to a super PAC tied to former Gov. Andrew Cuomo late last week.\nWas it Cuomo\u2019s recent comments about the 2019 rent law that inspired the donation? Another element of his platform?\n\u201cIt is what it is,\u201d Douglas Durst said of the donation in an email.\nProbably not the kind of endorsement we\u2019ll see in Cuomo campaign ads, but to the point.\nOne of the reasons I asked about the donation was that the Real Estate Board of New York\u2019s executive committee met with the former governor on March 20. Politico New York was the\nfirst to report\nthe REBNY meeting, in which Cuomo expressed regret about some aspects of the 2019 rent law, especially the changes to individual apartment improvements and major capital improvements.\nDurst was among the real estate executives \u2014\u00a0and long-time Cuomo donors \u2014 who\nreportedly\ncalled up the governor to plead with him in the eleventh hour to veto the 2019 law. It doesn\u2019t seem like the March 20 meeting was what moved Durst, however; He told me he wasn\u2019t there.\nBut in the days following the\nmeeting\nwith the trade group, members donated thousands of dollars to a super PAC tied to Cuomo.\nSuffolk Construction\u2019s John Fish contributed $250,000. RFR Holding threw in $100,000, and Related Companies\u2019 Stephen Ross donated $50,000. Other donors include Arbor Realty Trust, RD Management, Olmstead Properties\u2019 Samuel Rosenblatt and Tri-State Construction\u2019s Jack Irushalmi. And those are just the members of the executive committee who donated after the meeting.\nBefore the meeting, Empire State Development\u2019s Anthony Malkin gave $100,000, as did Lightstone Real Estate Partners. RXR Realty\u2019s Scott Rechler donated $250,000.\nAs mayor, Cuomo would have limited ability to do much about statewide rent regulations. He missed that chance. He could, however, try to\ninfluence\nthe Rent Guidelines Board on annual rent increases permitted for stabilized apartments. The mayor can\u2019t outright order higher increases or a rent freeze (though previous mayors have publicly called for freezes, and mayoral candidates have pledged to freeze the rent if elected).\nDurst didn\u2019t elaborate on his comments, but his bluntness echoes what I\u2019ve been hearing from others in real estate: While some are still mad at Cuomo about the rent laws, they see him as their best bet.\n\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: You are probably inundated with news about the Trump administration, but what kind of coverage, related specifically to real estate, would you like to see more of? What do you think is missing from daily coverage? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: A piece of\nold Penn Station\nhas landed at 34th Street and Eighth\u00a0 Avenue. One of the original 22 granite eagles that once adorned the original station\u2019s cornice is on display in a plaza outside Penn 1. I\u2019ve decided to call him Bj\u00f6rn, mostly because I now have the ABBA song \u201cEagle\u201d in my head. This particular eagle was too heavy to \u201cclimb higher and higher\u201d to the roof of Vornado Realty Trust\u2019s Penn 2, which is home to a replica (which I also\nnamed\n, with no authority to do so).\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 A federal judge on Wednesday\ndismissed\ncorruption charges against Mayor Eric Adams while ensuring that the case could not be revived after the November mayoral election. \u201cThis case should have never been brought, and I did nothing wrong,\u201d Adams said during a press conference after the decision was released.\n\u2014 What\u2019s old is new. Geographic detail is out, pretty colors are in. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority on Wednesday revealed a new subway map that is reminiscent of a map from the 1970s,\nthe New York Times reports\n. This is the first major change to the subway map in nearly 50 years.\n\u2014 Most New York City Housing Authority residents have no way to comply with the city\u2019s new composting rules,\nGothamist reports\n. NYCHA officials say they are working to resolve the issue by next year, but in the meantime, the city\u2019s sanitation department can\u2019t issue violations because there isn\u2019t a legal path for one city agency to issue a summons to another.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Wednesday was\n$5.7 million\nfor a 1,644-square-foot condominium unit at 160 Leroy Street in the West Village.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was $13.5 million for four parcels in Chelsea. The addresses included\n201-203\n,\n205\nWest 20th Street, and\n172-174 7th Avenue\n. Kinsey Equities sold the combined 25,777 square feet of space to Aetna Realty Company.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$15 million\nfor a 4,380-square-foot, sponsor-sale condo unit at 15 West 96th Street on the Upper West Side. Shane Boyle of Compass has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 44,928-square-foot six-story, 57-unit residential project at 1794 Clinton Avenue in Crotona Park East. Jakov Saric of Node Engineering &amp; Consulting filed the permit on behalf of Franc Gjini of Paramount Homes Management.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "Universal Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Company will not receive more than $30 million that it sought in allegedly fraudulent insurance claims in Florida after settling a civil suit tied to the matter.\nThe settlement resolves allegations that Fort Lauderdale-based Universal Property violated Florida law by securing reimbursement for ineligible claims, according to a press release. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier\u2019s office said it\u2019s the first time the attorney general has secured repayment in an insurance\nfraud\ncase.\nUniversal Property &amp; Casualty agreed to pay more than $4 million in fines, plus $2.4 million in legal fees for a total of about $6.5 million. Its parent company, Universal Insurance Holdings, said in its own release that it refuted all allegations of fraud related to\nHurricane Irma\nin 2017.\n\nA whistleblower\u2019s lawsuit in Leon County led to the attorney general\u2019s office launching its own investigation.\nThe reimbursement of more than $30 million to Universal Property &amp; Casualty would have come from the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, which pays residential property insurance companies a portion of their payments to homeowners for hurricane damage.\nFor decades, property owners have been grappling with soaring insurance costs, which have only intensified as a result of worsening global disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires. Florida has suffered from a spate of\nhurricanes\nin the last decade, including Irma, Ian, Milton, Helene and Idalia, though South Florida has largely been spared.\nLast month,\nFlorida lawmakers\ngrilled state insurance regulators about a report that showed insurers funneled billions of dollars to affiliates between 2017 and 2019 while they claimed to lose money, the\nTampa Bay Times\nreported. Former Insurance Commissioner David Altmaier commissioned the report, but after he abruptly left his post to become a lobbyist, it was left in draft form. It was never turned over to the legislature because it was unfinished, regulators said.\n",

        "content": "Last year, Carmel Partners trounced four appeals trying to block its plans to build a 24-story apartment building in L.A.\u2019s Carthay. The builder now aims to go much higher.\nThe San Francisco-based developer has filed revised plans to build a 43-story building on the approved site at 1050 South La Cienega Boulevard,\nUrbanize Los Angeles reported\n, citing a report from ATC. It would replace a vacant lot just south of Beverly Hills.\nNew preliminary plans call for a 43-story apartment tower with 532 units, with unspecified parking and open space.\nThe latest project would also include 64 affordable apartments set aside for\nextremely low-income\nhouseholds, or 12 percent of all its units.\nThe project replaces plans approved in fall 2023 to build a 24-story 290-unit highrise above 4,100 square feet of ground-floor shops. A podium and underground parking garage would serve 412 cars.\nCarmel Partners had sought Transit Oriented Community incentives to build a larger building than zoning rules allow in exchange for 29 affordable apartments for extremely low-income households.\nThe previous project, designed by Chicago-based Solomon Cordwell Buenz and initially planned at 28 stories, would have soared 271 feet, the tallest building in the area. The developer was cleared to build the tower after\nquashing four appeals\nin January last year. It featured a glass-covered building with rows of jutting balconies and a landscaped rooftop deck, according to renderings.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if the architect was retained for the replacement project, or what approvals Carmel Partners needs to add another 19 stories.\nCarmel Partners is no stranger to building high-rise buildings that soar far above their surroundings, according to Urbanize.\nThe project is the latest in a string of high-rise developments in Los Angeles from the firm, following\na 35-story highrise now taking shape in the Arts District\nand similar towers\nin West Adams\nand\nDowntown\n, according to Urbanize. Carmel Partners also plans to build\nthree big residential projects in Sawtelle\nand\nnew apartments in Long Beach\n.\nThe firm, led by Ron Zeff, was tied to a wide-ranging public corruption scandal centered on former Los Angeles City Council member Jos\u00e9 Huizar, sentenced early last year to\n13 years in federal prison\nafter admitting to a pay-to-play scheme for developers in exchange for $1.5 million in bribes.\nHuizar pleaded guilty to charges that involved accepting political contributions from Carmel Partners for his wife\u2019s short-lived City Council run during the approval process for the company\u2019s 35-story, 475-unit tower at 520 Mateo Street, in the Arts District.\nCarmel Partners\nagreed to pay a $1.2 million fine\nto avoid prosecution in connection with the City Hall corruption case, admitting no wrongdoing in the settlement.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "After leading the nation in apartment rent hikes in recent years, South Florida is getting a reprieve.\nIn Miami, monthly rents for two-bedroom units averaged at $3,350 in March, down 7.7 percent, year-over-year, according to a Zumper report. One-bedroom units averaged $2,550, or a 5.9 percent drop compared to March of last year.\nIt marks a turnaround from South Florida\u2019s multifamily rent surge \u2013\u2013 by a record\n58 percent\nfrom 2020 to 2022 \u2013\u2013 that followed an influx of out-of-staters creating unprecedented demand. Developers seized on the hot market with new projects. Now, their hefty completions over the past three years, coupled with a slowdown of in-migration, have balanced the market, allowing for a respite in rents.\nAs a whole, South Florida rents are down 2.2 percent, year-over-year, with the average monthly rent hitting $2,319, according to Realtor.com\u2019s February report. (This data is for studios, as well as one- and two-bedroom units.)\nLast month,\nDeerfield Beach\nled the tri-county region with the biggest year-over-year drop of 13 percent for one-bedroom rents, the Zumper report shows. The city\u2019s median monthly rate hit $1,600.\nSunny Isles Beach\ntook the title for the biggest rate drop for two-bedroom units at 18 percent, with the median rent hitting $3,960.\nOther municipalities with year-over-year rate drops in March include\nDelray Beach\n, with one-bedroom monthly rents down 11.5 percent to an average of $1,850, and two-bedroom rates down 2 percent to $2,450, according to Zumper.\n\nIn\nPompano Beach\n, one bedroom rents fell 10.8 percent to $1,650, and two bedroom rents dropped 10.7 percent to $2,170.\nMiami Beach\nsaw a drop of 4.6 percent to $2,480 for one-bedroom apartments, and 10.4 percent to $4,040 for two-bedroom units.\nCoral Gables\u2019\naverage one-bedroom rents hit $2,440, down 3.2 percent, and two-bedroom rents hit $3,600, down 5.8 percent.\nFort Lauderdale\nalso posted a drop of 2.6 percent for one-bedrooms, which now average $1,900, and a 9.5 percent drop for two-bedrooms, to $2,670.\nDespite all this, South Florida apartments remain pricey. Miami\u2019s $2,550 average monthly one-bedroom rent ranked as the highest in the tri-county region and the sixth highest nationwide, according to Zumper. The Magic City was more expensive than Arlington, Virginia and Los Angeles, but it still ranked behind New York, San Francisco, Jersey City, New Jersey, Boston and San Jose, California.\nIn some South Florida municipalities, rents rose in March.\nSunrise\nhad the biggest jump of 9.2 percent, with the average one-bedroom rate hitting $1,900.\nPembroke Pines\u2019\naverage two-bedroom rent of $2,400 marked a 4.3 percent increase.\nLast year, developers completed a record 18,600 apartments in South Florida, outpacing 15,000 net new leases, CoStar Group data shows. That came on the heels of developers\u2019 15,300 completions in 2023 and 11,200 in 2022.\nThe rent reprieve is good news for tenants. Many longtime South Floridians are cost burdened due to their incomes\nlagging behind\nthose of their out-of-state counterparts, some of whom kept their higher paying New York and California jobs.\nBut the rate decreases could complicate developers\u2019 bottom lines. Over the past three years, they have felt the sting from elevated interest rates, which increase debt obligations and complicate refinancings. And developers\u2019 hefty completions have led to slower lease-ups and an increase in\nconcessions\n.\n",

The sale price was not disclosed, but Malouf bought the property with a $6.42 million loan from Veritex Community Bank, loan documents show. The debt pencils out to $152,900 per acre.\nMalouf plans to develop a grocery-anchored retail project on the parcel, which is at the intersection of Parker Road and Southview Drive. Plans include a 130,000-square-foot shopping center, 25,000 square feet for restaurants and a community park. Construction is set to start in the fourth quarter and wrap up in 2026.\n\nIt will deliver Lucas\u2019 \u201cfirst true grocery store,\u201d Mayor Dusty Kuykendall said in the release.\nLucas has a population of about 8,600. The community is experiencing the growth wave that\u2019s expanded the Metroplex northeast from Dallas. Lucas\u2019 population jumped almost 14 percent between 2020 and 2023.\nThe Great Recession and the decline of the American mall had experts predicting the death of retail in the 2010s, leading developers to avoid development. As a result, the recent retail boom has been fueled by limited supply, driving up retail rents.\nVacancy in the Dallas-Fort Worth retail market was 4.7 percent in the fourth quarter, near historic lows, according to Partners Real Estate. The average asking rent was $20.08 per square foot, an increase of 4.5 percent from a year before.\n",

        "content": "After a year on the market, an East Bay vineyard with its own baseball field is hitting the auction block and its owners say no previous winemaking experience is required!\nAfter all, Campos Family Vineyards owners Ric and Michelle Campos had never owned a winery before they bought the 44-acre Contra Costa property for $5 million in 2016.\n\u201cWe said, \u2018You\u2019re nuts. We don\u2019t know anything about farming. We don\u2019t know anything about wine making,\u2019\u201d Ric Campos recalled telling the previous owner, who suggested the Camposes take it over after they had developed a friendship.\nHe said a higher power convinced him to give the Byron property a shot.\n\u201cThe lord gave me a vision to buy that property, really to minister to our community,\u201d he said.\nIn the nine years since, the couple said they\u2019ve turned its vineyard, olive orchard, baseball field and 11,000-square-foot event center into a community gathering spot, hosting concerts, church services, weddings, Little League and adult kickball league games, and, of course, wine tastings.\nThough their wines are sold at Costco, Safeway and numerous area restaurants, the events help the Camposes create much-needed profits to help subsidize the wine making, Ric said, calling it \u201ca tough business right now.\u201d\nHe added that he thinks the Trump tariffs on foreign wine would \u201c100 percent\u201d be a good thing for smaller California winemakers because cheap wine coming in from big makers in Australia and South Africa makes it hard to compete. Contra Costa has its own American Viticultural Area and the property includes Zinfandel, Barbera, Mourv\u00e8dre, Cab Franc and Petite Syrah vines.\nThe couple said they recently renovated the backyard and pool of their four-bedroom, four-bathroom 4,400-square foot home on the property based on a place they stayed in Italy. They\u2019ve also received permits for a farm-to-table restaurant, a bed and breakfast and six tiny homes for vacation rentals.\n\u201cIf we stayed, we\u2019d definitely go forward with some of that,\u201d Ric said.\nInstead they say it\u2019s time to retire and spend time with their three children and seven grandchildren, passing the torch to a new owner, who they hope can take the property to the next level. In addition to giving up the vineyard, Ric is also retiring as the owner of his own storm water inspection and maintenance company.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bittersweet for us but we know this is the right thing to do,\u201d Michelle said, adding that they have already bought a more traditional home about five miles away, as well as another in San Juan Capistrano.\nAfter about a year on the traditional market at $10.5 million, the Campos\u2019 said they decided to try the wider reach of selling the home via a live auction at the vineyard at 11 am on April 7. In the run up, they\u2019ve been holding weekly open houses.\n\u201cThis property needs to go worldwide to get a really good audience, so that\u2019s why we went the auction route,\u201d Ric said, adding that a buyer from London had reached out recently.\nThough the auction, run by Elite Auctions, has no reserve, the Camposes say they \u201chave a number in mind\u201d and if they don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to hit it they can stop the auction before it begins. SF Examiner owner Clint Reilly\ndid just that\nwhen he didn\u2019t get pre-bids that reached his expectations on his vineyard estate in Napa last month.\nSellers can decide on auction day before the proceedings commence whether or not to move forward with the sale, confirmed Randy Haddaway, Elite Auctions founder and CEO, but said the live nature of Elite\u2019s auction model means that few sellers opt out.\n\u201cIf you take a look at our past 10 auctions, all of our sellers moved forward because we bring the buyers there and these are people who aren\u2019t accustomed to losing in their lifetime,\u201d he said. \u201cThey came there to win.\u201d\nElite never works with distressed owners, he said, and all their deals are all-cash, as is, no contingencies, with a 30-day close. All properties are also subject to a pre-auction offer and sale. Out of the last six auctions, four sold before auction day, he said. If it goes to auction, many bidders don\u2019t register to take part in the sale until that day.\n\u201cThese are the types of people who can afford $10 million, cash,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t show their cards.\u201d\nAny inspections requested need to take place before auction day and are paid for by the bidder. Any issues discovered can be factored into the bid, but sellers don\u2019t make any fixes.\nThe Camposes say they went with Elite in part because of the onsite auction approach, as they believe the property is best experienced in person and not just online. They will also be onsite for the auction of their \u201cbaby\u201d with a team of supporters helping them through the day, Michelle said. If the new buyer has vintner experience that\u2019s great, they said, but they\u2019re willing to stay on to help with the transition if need be, as is their lead winemaker.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little nerve wracking, of course, because we want to sell to the right people,\u201d Michelle said. \u201cBut who are we to decide who the right people are? So we\u2019re just trusting the process.\u201d\n",

The building is almost 90 percent occupied, according to the landlord.\nPrior to BXP\u2019s arrival, the landlords of the 870,000-square-foot property completed $135 million in capital upgrades at the 1909 building.\nL&amp;L acquired the building, once known as the International Toy Center, in 2007 alongside Lehman Brothers for $480 million.

        "content": "Nathan Berman, the man with a (conversion) plan, is facing the threat of foreclosure at one of his Financial District sites.\nThe special servicer of a $265 million securitized loan filed a pre-foreclosure action against Metro Loft Management at 180 Water Street on Wednesday, PincusCo\nreported\n. The complaint was filed in U.S. District Court by special servicer CWCapital Asset Management.\nThe court filings were the next step after KBRA revealed in November that Metro Loft was\non the verge of defaulting\non the $265 million mortgage backing the property. Metro Loft allegedly defaulted on the senior loan at the beginning of that month, according to the complaint.\nA $100 million mezzanine loan was also expected to mature in November, but that debt is not referenced in yesterday\u2019s complaint. That month, Berman told Crain\u2019s that the firm was \u201cworking things out with both lenders,\u201d but didn\u2019t add anything further.\nMetro Loft did not immediately respond to a request for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nIn 2017, Berman\npaid $450 million\nto buy partner Vanbarton Group out of the rental property. That was three years after Metro Loft purchased a minority stake and two years after the partners began a $100 million conversion of the property.\n\nThe 573-unit, 460,000-square-foot conversion was completed and opened in 2017. Occupancy was 98 percent as of the KBRA report and the average rent was $4,800. Amenities include a 1,200-square-foot courtyard and an indoor pool.\nDeutsche Bank originated the $265 million senior mortgage in 2019, portions of which were collateralized in commercial mortgage-backed securities. Wells Fargo was assigned the mortgage as trustee of the debtholders.\nDeutsche also originated the mezzanine debt before Rockwood Capital took control of the loan in 2019.\nBerman\u2019s firm is one of the biggest players in office-to-residential conversions in New York City. In January, Metro Loft and David Werner\nscored a $135 million loan\nfrom the Northwind Group for the conversion of the former Pfizer headquarters in Midtown Manhattan.\nBut Berman has also faced his fair share of struggles. Over the summer, for instance, Metro Loft\ndisclosed\nthat it wouldn\u2019t be able to repay a $250 million loan backing the conversion at 20 Broad Street when the debt matured the following month.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

In November, Morningstar Credit reported the center\u2019s\nvalue\ndropped about 35 percent to $255 million since April 2024, when Santa Monica Place entered special servicing.\nMacerich CFO\nScott Kingsmore\nblamed the city\u2019s \u201ccontinuing issues,\u201d calling it \u201cunder water\u201d in an interview last June with fashion trade publication WWD. The executive went on to say, \u201ctrying to figure out the end game\u201d on the property \u201cwas just too obscure.\u201d\nMacerich began re-tooling its real estate strategy last March, when it appointed Jack Hsieh as president and ceo. Under Hsieh, the focus has been on centers Macerich believes hold the most long-term potential, while dropping others from its portfolio.\nAmong the Macerich malls viewed as growth vehicles is the Los Cerritos Center, where Hsieh told analysts last month the company is considering the possibility of a new anchor in the former Sears location, while potentially selling off land at the mall that\u2019s entitled for residential.\nFor Santa Monica Place, the center has seen major anchors, such as Bloomingdale\u2019s and ArcLight Cinemas, leave. Meanwhile, the neighboring 3rd Street Promenade has also seen its fair share of tenant turnover.\n\n\u201cWhile challenges have led to vacancy at both Santa Monica Place and its neighboring retail district, 3rd Street Promenade, the city and state have made crucial policy changes that will allow for Santa Monica\u2019s recovery,\u201d Stenn Parton, Prism\u2019s founder and CEO, said in a statement.\nParton went on to say the company plans on \u201cbringing great brands and restaurants back\u201d to the center.\nParton was traveling and could not be immediately reached for comment Thursday to elaborate on the policy changes or tenant merchandising strategy.\nHe acknowledged in his prepared statement the plans for the center are running up against a ticking clock to seize on opportunities from major events set to bring thousands to Los Angeles and the surrounding areas.\nThat starts off with next year\u2019s FIFA World Cup taking place in Inglewood at SoFi Stadium followed by the 2028 Olympics, the latter of which will place the mall and city \u201con display,\u201d Parton said.\nPrism\u2019s portfolio includes a mix of owned and managed real estate in the country\u2019s western and Sun Belt markets. In California, that includes Hermitage Rodeo in Beverly Hills, Paseo Nuevo in Santa Barbara, Runway in Playa Vista and Pasadena Commons in Pasadena.\n",

        "content": "A North Beach commercial property owner hopes to beat the neighborhood\u2019s pending designation as a historic district with a teardown of a fire-ravaged building to make way for a denser project than a prior plan to save its facade.\nThe push on timing came to light in a report by the\nSan Francisco Chronicle,\nwhich obtained emails between Jeff Jurow, a partner in the Verdi Building at 659 North Union Street, and city officials. Jurow subsequently confirmed his plan to get ahead of the historic designation, which is expected later this year, the Chronicle reported.\nThe facade of the early 20th century Verdi Building \u2014 which survived fires that gutted the rest of the structure over the past decade or so \u2014 is a key to the redevelopment of the property. Jurow said that a prior plan would have preserved the facade as part of a 23-unit apartment complex with a restaurant.\nNow Jurow wants more units, including some hotel rooms, in a taller structure that would require the removal of the facade. The plan would make use of local laws that allow bigger projects in exchange for certain numbers of affordable units in the mix.\n\nThat plan is being met with opposition based on claims it will destroy a historically significant element of the structure and cast shadows on a nearby park.\nThe emails obtained by the Chronicle indicate that Jurow is anxious to gain approvals as the Northeast San Francisco Conservancy pressed a case for a North Beach Historic District, which could put restrictions that limit new construction on 600 or so buildings in the neighborhood known for its Italian-American roots.\nA state panel is slated to take up the proposal for the North Beach historic designation when it convenes for May 8 and May 9 meetings.\nAn approval by the state panel would move the process to the federal officer, the Keeper of the National Register of Historic Places, who would have 45 days to grant the designation.\nJurow wants to lock in his plans under state laws, including\nSB423\nand SB330, both intended to aid developers in bringing housing to the market, provided they meet targets on affordable units.",

The project is estimated to cost $52 million and could deliver by mid-2026, according to project filings.

The land\u2019s taxable value is estimated at $990,000 by the Dallas Central Appraisal District.\n\nThe site lies in a growing industrial corridor in Irving, just east of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, a submarket seeing consistent demand due to its proximity to major logistics routes and infrastructure.\nRockefeller recently began work on its first Houston-area developments, including a four-story apartment complex and a two-building industrial project in Katy and Baytown.\nIf the Irving project moves forward, it would add to the increasing pipeline of industrial development across the region, one of the most active logistics markets in the U.S. Rockefeller Group is a newcomer to Texas, but its recent moves suggest the firm may be setting the stage for a broader footprint across key markets in the state.\nRockefeller is a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Group and manages about 6 million square feet of office space in Midtown Manhattan.

But when you ask him where he\u2019s most successful, he always says, \u2018I made my money in real estate.\u2019\u201d\nTahari Capital, which launched in 2020, oversees a roughly $300 million portfolio across multi-family, commercial, residential and retail and has been self-servicing those properties.\n\u201cWe really thought that we could do great for everyone else because we do great for ourselves,\u201d Tahari said.\nTahari Realty has brought on Jordan Sutton, a former director at Cushman &amp; Wakefield, as a managing partner.\n\nThe brokerage will be full-service, offering investment sales, capital advisory, retail and office leasing, and residential sales and leasing. \u201cI don\u2019t see many firms out there that are handling everything,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cIt\u2019s either your residential or commercial.\u201d\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a firm that\u2019s not handling capital advisory, or a firm that\u2019s not handling investment sales, they might say, \u2018I get loans, so let me just get you a loan,\u2019\u201d Tahari said. \u201cBut the reality is, you might get more liquidity from a sale than a refinance, or vice versa.\u201d\nSutton and Tahari got connected in 2022 when Sutton arranged the sale of an East Harlem apartment building to Tahari, his first purchase as part of his family\u2019s company. Sutton was also behind the sale of the company\u2019s East Hampton retail property to LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault for $22 million in 2023. (Tahari also attended Sutton\u2019s wedding last year.)\nSutton, who focused on investment sales at Cushman, said he sees the middle market \u2014 sales between $1 million to $100 million \u2014 as a strong foundation for the firm to grow.\nThe firm has already booked around $250 million on the capital advisory side, $80 million of investment sales and several retail lease assignments Downtown as of mid-March.\n",

        "content": "The Chicago Bears appear to be warming once again to Arlington Heights in pursuit of a new stadium.\nAfter pitching its vision for a\nlakefront stadium in downtown Chicago\nlast year, team president and CEO Kevin Warren confirmed the Bears are no longer focused solely on a downtown site.\nSpeaking after an NFL owners meeting in Florida, Warren emphasized a dual-track approach, saying the team is considering its 326-acre site at the former Arlington Park racetrack as well as the downtown Museum Campus, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nBut his public enthusiasm for the suburban option marked a clear tonal shift. After the Wednesday meeting, Warren praised the topography, transit access and development potential of the Arlington Heights site, including its abundant space for a mixed-use entertainment district and its adjacent Metra station.\nThe team bought the site, formerly home of the Arlington International Racecourse, for\n$197 million in 2021\n.\nThe franchise\u2019s founder, the late George Halas, identified the location as ideal more than 50 years ago, Bears Chairman George McCaskey said. The team is conducting feasibility studies on both sites and says design plans are already halfway complete.\nThough the Bears haven\u2019t ruled out downtown, infrastructure hurdles are steep. The team estimates about $1.5 billion in upgrades would be needed to make the Museum Campus site viable year-round, a major sticking point for state lawmakers and the City Council, despite support from Mayor Brandon Johnson.\nBy comparison, infrastructure improvements in Arlington Heights are expected to cost about half that amount, though the village\u2019s Mayor Jim Tinaglia has pledged any stadium plan would undergo thorough scrutiny.\n\nThe team previously\nresolved tax issues\nin Arlington Heights through negotiations with three school districts, but Warren said they\u2019re still seeking longer-term assurances to avoid dramatic tax increases down the line.\n\u201cWe want to pay our taxes, but you don\u2019t want to find yourself in the position where 15 years down the road, your tax bill quadruples,\u201d he said.\nThe team still plans to start construction on a stadium by the end of this year, Warren said.\nThe Bears have pledged $2 billion toward construction and have not asked for public subsidies, unlike another\n$3.2 billion pitch for a stadium in Bronzeville\nfrom Farpoint Development, which proposed $600 million in state infrastructure funds and which now seems to have lost the Bears\u2019 attention.\nA final decision on location is still pending, but Bears leadership will need support from state leaders in Springfield, in any case.\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell acknowledged the complexity of the process and said discussions like these inevitably involve \u201ctwists and turns.\u201d\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "The city unveiled a new site as part of a program to boost affordable housing availability for homeless shelter residents.\nIt opened a 64-unit site in the Bronx\u2019s Wakefield neighborhood last week, the seventh opening since the program\u2019s launch two years ago. The site is part of a city initiative \u2014 dubbed the Affordable Housing Service \u2014 where the city foots most of the rent, Gothamist\nreported\n.\nThe program leans on holders of city rental assistance vouchers, known as CityFHEPS. Holders of the vouchers pay about 30 percent of their income towards rent, while the city picks up the rest. There are currently 11,000 voucher holders who are stuck in shelters due to a lack of housing or landlords who will take vouchers.\nUnder the program, the city contracts nonprofits to bring voucher holders to affordable housing developments. The idea is that affordable housing developers will have an easier time finding financing for projects because of a promised stream of reliable rent payments coming directly from the city.\nShelter residents are prioritized for this program, specifically those who have been in the system for at least two years or are at risk for a significant long-term stay.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any other cities that are doing this,\u201d Slate Property Group principal David Schwartz told Gothamis. \u201cThe only way out of this [housing] crisis is to build more housing and New York City\u2019s figured out a tool to do it.\u201d\nMore than 450 units have been delivered since the inception of the initiative. There are more than 500 units in the program\u2019s pipeline, set to be delivered in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn.\nThe program also enables the city to provide tenants support in applying for other services, such as food stamps, in an effort to keep them housed.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Property records show that in 2022 the deeds of both buildings were transferred to Florida LLCs registered to OKO. Records show OKO financed the acquisition with a $105 million loan from MSD Capital that year.\n\nMiami-based\nOKO\nis led by Vlad Doronin, who is also CEO of Aman Group, and London-based Cain is helmed by Jonathan Goldstein. The firm is a partnership between Goldstein and Todd Boehly\u2019s Eldridge Industries, based in Greenwich, Connecticut.\nIn their presentation to\nPalm Beach\u2019s\nArchitectural Review Commission (Arcom) last week, the developers referenced rising insurance costs and\nnew condo safety regulations\nthat are kneecapping units in South Florida\u2019s aging buildings. It is notoriously difficult for developers to pass muster with Arcom, and further deliberation on the project was deferred to its May 28 meeting.\nWhile Palm Beach has not had condo development in recent history, its neighbor West Palm Beach has seen an explosion of projects with\nthousands of units in the pipeline\n.",

His salary for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024 was $140,000, according to the Miami Design Preservation League\u2019s most recent Form 990. Ciraldo started with the organization in 2014 as a historic preservation officer.\nAt two city meetings last month, Miami Beach commissioner\nDavid Suarez\nraised concerns about alleged conflicts of interest.\nSuarez discussed his issues during the city\u2019s Finance and Economic Resiliency Committee meeting on March 26, at which point Miami Design Preservation League\u2019s Vice Chair Nina Weber Worth said that Ciraldo resigned.\nDuring his presentation, Suarez pointed out contributions that the nonprofit received from developers, including a $5,000 donation from Terra in September, and Ciraldo\u2019s support two months later of\nTerra\nand the Meruelo family\u2019s proposed redevelopment of the oceanfront Deauville Beach Resort in Miami Beach.\nAt a Miami Beach commission meeting on March 19, Ciraldo supported the project, praising its design and David Martin, Terra\u2019s CEO.\nBut Ciraldo was also critical of the Meruelos and of the height the developers are seeking. The commission\nvoted on first reading\nto approve two ordinances tied to the project.\n\u201cA donation is made. [The] position is either changed or made in favor of it,\u201d Suarez said during the finance meeting.

It\u2019s disappointing to see individuals like David Suarez attempt to mischaracterize my work and the contributions of the Miami Design Preservation League for political gain,\u201d he wrote.\nWeber Worth, who represented the preservation league at the finance meeting days after the commission meeting, said the organization is in transition.\n\u201cWe can also work with you in setting the guidelines for who we can take contributions from, and how we can always put our best forward as a lobbyist when needed,\u201d she said.\nAccording to its website, the nonprofit Miami Design Preservation League is a \u201cpreservation and arts organization that preserves, protects, and promotes the architectural, cultural, social, and environmental integrity of Miami Beach and the surrounding areas.\u201d\nMiami Beach commissioner Kristen Rosen Gonzalez is among elected officials who have defended Ciraldo and the Miami Design Preservation League.\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that this attack on the preservation league is some way to dismantle our historic preservation protections,\u201d she said at the March 19 meeting.\nIf elected commissioner, Ciraldo said he will focus on infrastructure and continue to advocate for residents.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to fix our infrastructure before we promote more high-rises in Miami Beach,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been going to Tallahassee advocating for some preemption bills.

Today, things are more stagnant. That\u2019s laid bare in the effects on residential real estate, a local profession that\u2019s unique in its large makeup of established and hopeful film and TV players that flock to selling for second acts.\nIt\u2019s difficult to peg a specific timestamp for when Hollywood began its slow slip. Some say a decade ago. Others point to the birth of streaming services such as\nNetflix\n, which launched in 1997. Regardless, a confluence of factors conspired against the industry, including a lack of incentives to keep production in California and a paradigm shift in the business model that favored shorter series being churned at a rapid clip from streamers over network TV\u2019s 20-plus episodes per season and rerun residuals.\nThat\u2019s impacted residential submarkets such as Burbank, Valencia in the Santa Clarita Valley, Studio City and Mar Vista where many in the industry called home.\n\u201cPeople are getting work sporadically, so that has a real hallowing out,\u201d Knizek said. \u201cThe whole business model shift is dramatically impacting where people live.\u201d\nIf there\u2019s one bright spot, it may be that the state\u2019s film and TV industry was the only creative segment to see growth, according to Otis College of Art and Design\u2019s annual \u201cReport on the Creative Economy,\u201d released last month.\nThe industry added 14,670 jobs last year, according to the report. While the figure is upbeat, the industry\u2019s 2024 payroll was still down 25 percent from a 2022 high created during the pinnacle of the pandemic\u2019s shelter-in-place orders that had the country hooked on series such as \u201cTiger King\u201d and \u201cThe Last Dance.\u201d\nIf industry employment is showing any signs of a rebound, agents in the residential market aren\u2019t seeing it just yet.\nCash is king\n\u2014\nif you have it\nInstead, the new normal in residential is fewer deals among those the industry calls \u201cbelow the line\u201d workers \u2014 or day-to-day pre- and post-production talent typically earning hourly wages.\nPaul Lester,\nThe Agency\nco-founder and member of the brokerage\u2019s Pad and Associates team, said about half of his client base is comprised of producers, director, actors, costume design, music and other disciplines within entertainment.\nHe\u2019s noted a pause that\u2019s taken a hold on residential dealmaking coming out of the 2023\nstrikes\nthat included the Writers Guild of America and Screen Actors Guild\u2013American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. The WGA strike ended in September 2023 after 148 days, while SAG-AFTRA ended after 118 days in November 2023.\n\u201cI would say for 75 percent of the industry they\u2019re either on hold, taking a breath, or going slowly into the market, needing to borrow funds to make the transaction happen,\u201d Lester said.\nOne of his clients in animation, a challenged segment given the rise of artificial intelligence, has had to pivot for work. He and his family also needed a new home. With the couple\u2019s money tied up in the old home that hadn\u2019t yet been sold and the new address being pricier, they took out a bridge loan nearly the price of the new house in order to get a deal done.\nFewer people paying all cash began around the time of the strikes and in the months following with many jobs that went unfilled during the work stoppage never refilled. Since then, some buyers have made lateral moves, for example, moving from a $2 million home into another $2 million property. In other cases, buyers are increasing their financing, with Lester seeing 50 percent to 60 percent loan-to-value ratios in scenarios that may have been all cash in the past.\n\u201cThere was this rethink in the buying power of people in the industry because they realized, \u2018I\u2019m not getting back the income that I had. I need to readjust,\u2019\u201d Lester said.\nRelocation services are also up for consideration more than before, although there hasn\u2019t been a rash of that type of movement to suggest a full-on trend.\nA costume designer Lester works with moved back to New York from Los Angeles temporarily due to fewer opportunities locally. New York made sense because it\u2019s closer to London, where she\u2019s finding more work at the moment.\nIt\u2019s a different story for another segment of the industry.\n\nFor A-list directors and actors or high-up studio executives, a cash crunch was never an issue. Some may have paused buying and selling in the wake of the strikes for the sake of solidarity, but inactivity isn\u2019t forever, pointed out Jonathan Nash of Carolwood Estates\u2019 Resnick &amp; Nash team.\n\u201cI think for a lot of people, it\u2019s optics,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the rest of the industry is clubbing together to effect change, a lot of people withheld major investments in a show of solidarity,\u201d Nash said. \u201cWe\u2019re typically dealing with those in the market who didn\u2019t find themselves without funds.\u201d\nGenerally, that\u2019s working in markets such as Beverly Hills, Bel-Air and the Hollywood Hills.\n\u201cThe strikes of course caused a slowdown in the market that was already a bit slower in the lead up to the election with the increased interest rates,\u201d Nash said. \u201cBut, as of late, in light of the new administration and the strikes becoming more of a distant memory, people have suffered fatigue not doing anything with their homes. So, starting with the end of last year, we\u2019ve seen an uptick of transactions.\u201d\nState of emergency?\nSome in the industry are hopeful Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s proposal to expand the Film &amp; Television Tax Credit Program might help woo production back to the state, thereby generating more jobs.\nSenate Bill 630 was introduced in February and aims to expand the annual tax credit ceiling to $750 million from $330 million.\nBeverly Hills Estates\nco-founder and President Branden Williams isn\u2019t letting Newsom and other politicians off the hook that easily. As he surveys the landscape of what\u2019s left of the local entertainment industry, he\u2019s pinning affordability issues and higher business costs on those in power\n\u201cI blame this on Gavin Newsom,\u201d he said. \u201cI blame this on [Mayor] Karen Bass for not immediately giving tax breaks to Hollywood. This is very similar to the ULA mansion tax.\u201d\nMeasure ULA\n, which voters passed in November 2022, applies a tiered tax to residential and commercial properties in the city of Los Angeles. Each year, the tax is adjusted in line with the chained consumer price index, which weighs how consumers change their spending habits when prices rise. The new floors for the tax go into effect June 30 and apply a 4 percent tax on properties starting at $5.3 million and 5.5 percent for those $10.6 million or more.\nFrom Williams\u2019 perspective, ULA \u201churt everybody\u201d by making it pricier for residential deals, but also studios or production firms that use industrial or office space.\nSome also point to 2019\u2019s Assembly Bill 5, largely aimed at ensuring gig economy workers had access to benefits as another regulation gone wrong for Hollywood. Some freelancers opposed the law on grounds of work drying up from companies only seeing more costs associated with reclassifying workers from freelance to employee under the new law.\n\u201cI used to see filming, commercials, print ads and movies being filmed all over our city,\u201d Williams said of growing up in Los Angeles, near the Beverly Center mall. \u201cIt was so exciting seeing a shoot going on in Hollywood, not to mention if you were out of town on vacation.\u201d\nThe landscape\u2019s different now, according to Williams, who has also acted and directed. When he first got into selling real estate, the majority of his clients were actors, writers, producers and agents.\n\u201cNow you barely see any of them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a lot of them now are selling and saying, \u2018We\u2019re out of California. We\u2019re out of Los Angeles. It\u2019s too expensive.\u2019\u201d\nThat includes a friend of his, an actor on a television show, who recently moved to Texas, citing the Lone Star state\u2019s affordability. His friend isn\u2019t an anomaly as California, in more recent years, has seen residents leaving the state in favor of places such as\nTexas\n.\n\u201cThis is an emergency and [politicians] better do something about it now, but seeing what they\u2019ve done to our economy, I have zero faith,\u201d said Williams as he railed against local and state politicians. \u201cWe better think about how we vote next time.\u201d\nThe Agency\u2019s Lester is a bit more hopeful. As the aftershocks from 2023\u2019s strikes subside, he feels there may be the chance for a bounce back.\nWill residential activity from Hollywood come back this year? Maybe. Like anything in real estate, losses \u2014 whether deals or clients \u2014 are always viewed as temporary by those whose livelihoods are built around the art of the hustle. As Lester pointed out, \u201cWhere I was seeing an actor buy a great house in Beverly Hills Post Office, now it might be the investor in tech replacing that buyer.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The academic reckoning has begun for Measure ULA.\nIt turns out, the pace of investment sales in Los Angeles slowed by roughly half when the city\u2019s so-called \u201cMansion Tax\u201d went into effect in 2023,\naccording to an analysis\npublished this week of some 338,000 transactions across the county over the past five years by University of California, Los Angeles researchers Michael Manville and Mott Smith.\nIt\u2019s perhaps the most ambitious attempt yet to quantify the market impact of the ballot measure since it passed three years ago, imposing a 4 percent tax on real estate sales above $5 million and 5.5 percent on sales over $10 million.\nAbout 60 percent of deals that meet the threshold are for single-family homes \u2014 mansions, as the law\u2019s nickname implies. The rest are multifamily, office or industrial buildings, according to the study.\nAnd a slump in those markets will have dire consequences for the city\u2019s budget and housing supply, Manville and Smith argue.\nAlready, the drop in sales volume has translated to a $25 million initial annual loss in city property tax revenue, they estimate. That shortfall will compound over time and offset the revenue L.A. raises from the tax.\nBut to anyone involved in commercial real estate in L.A., this is not news.\n\u201cThat 5.5 percent is very material to capital providers,\u201d said Moses Kagan, founder of Adaptive Realty, which buys, renovates and manages multifamily properties in L.A. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a very large portion of the total profit for the developer.\u201d\nKagan added the tax makes underwriting more difficult since passive lenders now risk \u201ctaking a haircut\u201d in case of foreclosure.\nManville and Smith say the data proves what many in the industry have observed since the tax has been on the books.\n\u201cMeasure ULA might be our single most important policy change in the past 10 years,\u201d Smith told\nThe Real Deal.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to impact our regional economy and our ability to build enough housing. It was not adequately analyzed before it passed.\u201d\nBut that\u2019s beginning to change. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass\nhinted at the possibility\nof reforming the two-year-old tax last month, and now lawmakers in Sacramento are also tuning in.\nAssemblymember Buffy Wicks is among those calling for a reappraisal. On Monday, Wicks\nintroduced a bill\nrestricting cities from enacting new transfer taxes before studying the impact on housing production.\nIt\u2019s a halting first step toward reform. An earlier version of the bill would have created an exemption for commercial and multifamily properties completed in the last 15 years, according to a copy of the draft bill obtained by\nTRD.\n\nA spokesperson for Wicks described the bill\u2019s current version as \u201cjust the start of a conversation.\u201d\nThe fact is, progressive transfer taxes are de rigeur in California housing policy circles.\nWith Measure ULA, Angelenos followed in the footsteps of voters in San Jose, San Francisco, Culver City and Santa Monica, where various versions of a \u201cmansion\u201d tax have gone into effect over the past five years.\nA spokesperson for United to House LA, which ran the campaign to pass the ballot measure in 2022, cast doubt on Manville and Smith\u2019s findings, citing the numerous confounding variables.\n\u201c\u200b\u200bIt\u2019s hard to draw conclusions given the number of factors,\u201d the spokesperson wrote in an email to\nTRD\n. \u201cIts initial dip owes more to developers and the real estate lobby hoping to overturn it in court or at the ballot box \u2014 and losing.\u201d\nMeasure ULA prevailed over legal challenges in its first year, and also survived a ballot measure attempting to strike it down, which was defeated last June. But Manville and Smith\u2019s analysis extends six months beyond that and the challenges to ULA were not sufficient for prospective sellers to keep their properties off the market.\nWhat\u2019s clear is that the tax has fallen far short of the $900 million proponents predicted it would raise in annual tax revenue. In its first 20 months, it brought in $288 million in annual revenue, which is earmarked for developing affordable housing and preventing homelessness.\nThat\u2019s enough evidence for some former proponents to change their tune. In fact, one of them is right down the hall from Manville and Smith at UCLA\u2019s Luskin School for Public Affairs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing some pretty stark negative effects of Measure ULA, but they\u2019re not inevitable,\u201d researcher Shane Phillips said in an email.\nPhillips studies housing at UCLA and\nco-authored a report\nendorsing the ULA ballot measure in 2022. Back then, the trio did not see eye to eye.\nThree years later, Phillips still believes local transfer taxes can be a good source of revenue for affordable housing, but it\u2019s not so clear cut, he said.\nMeasure ULA would work better if it were graduated to avoid arbitrary thresholds and, he added, recently developed multifamily projects should be exempt.\nManville and Smith agree.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s actually most noticeable is you\u2019re reducing the turnover of commercial, multifamily and industrial sites,\u201d Manville said. \u201cMany voters probably didn\u2019t understand what was going on, that these transactions are actually\u00a0 important, particularly for housing production.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Downtown Chicago\u2019s office market just blew past another grim milestone. The vacancy rate climbed to 26.5 percent in the first quarter, the 11th consecutive quarter of record-high availability, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe pace of tenant shrinkage is slowing. Vacancy rose just 0.2 percent\nfrom the fourth quarter\n, according to CBRE. But that\u2019s not enough to reverse the damage.\nRemote work and corporate downsizing have left the central business district with more than 2.1 million fewer square feet of leased space since the start of the pandemic. That\u2019s contributed to widespread foreclosures and deep property devaluations as landlords struggle to retain tenants, refinance debt and justify further capital investments.\nThere were some signs of stabilization to start the year. Net absorption, the change in leased and occupied space, turned positive for the first time since mid-2023, rising by 56,000 square feet.\nTenants including\nStripe\n,\nBlue Owl Capital\nand law firm\nGoldman Ismail\nsigned significant office expansions downtown.\n\nMeanwhile, investors have begun picking up distressed buildings at steep discounts, betting that the market has bottomed out. But many have other plans, leveraging the\noffice-to-residential conversion wave\nsweeping downtown, backed by city subsidies.\nThe divide between newer and older buildings continues to widen, as the \u201cflight to quality\u201d trend continues. The vacancy rate for Class A buildings is just under 21 percent, compared with 32 percent for older Class B offices.\nArnold &amp; Porter\nand\nJBT Marel\nrecently relocated to renovated towers 300 North LaSalle and 333 West Wacker, for example.\nSublease space is down to 5.6 million square feet from 8 million at the end of 2023, but availability is well above pre-pandemic levels. With capital tight and many buildings underwater on their loans, finalizing lease deals is a slow, often lender-constrained process.\nNo new office buildings were delivered downtown last quarter, but the only project still underway, 919 West Fulton, is set to deliver soon in the trendy Fulton Market neighborhood.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

Morningstar\u2019s Sarah Helwig told the Business Times that cash flow from the property was down to $9.6 million in 2024, below the $11.4 million outlined in the underwriting at the loan\u2019s issuance.\nMaximus declined to comment to the Business Times on the most recent turn, which follows the firm\u2019s default earlier this year on a $1.5 billion loan against the 3,165-unit Parkmerced complex at 3711 19th Ave.\nRosania made a big splash in the Bay Area when he bought Parkmerced 20 years ago, adding to his portfolio over the years.

He said the plan to reopen while that chunk of the customer base is still displaced is a bid to spur rebuilding by fostering a sense of community.\n\nCaruso relied on private fire fighting services during the wildfire, and that\u2019s believed to be a key reason it survived largely unscathed. The 125,000-square-foot center, with 42 shops set in the middle of the upscale enclave, has been closed since thousands of homes were destroyed in the disaster in January.\nCaruso said he expects most of the tenants at the center to resume operations once it reopens.\nTancredi Deluca, who owns Angelini restaurant and bar at Palisades Village, told the outlet he plans to reopen at the center as soon as possible.\nCaruso is a billionaire developer whose namesake firm is known for upscale retail projects like The Grove and Americana at Brand. He recently founded a nonprofit called\nSteadfast LA\nto aid in rebuilding efforts after the wildfires. He ran for mayor in 2022 and is a vocal\ncritic\nof Mayor Karen Bass regarding her handling of the wildfire response and has expressed interest in running for office again in the future.

The price comes to $183 per square foot or $786,500 per acre.\nLegalZoom paid $21 million for the property in 2013. IUt was most recently appraised at $41.8 million.\nRound Rock ISD plans to convert the office into a center for career and technical education and innovation, housing programs like auto body, cosmetology, early childhood education and electrical trades. The building will also provide space for robotics teams and student organizations.\nLegalZoom had a $41 million cash purchase agreement with Trinity Foundation RE Venture LLC to sell the property in 2023, but the deal never closed.\n\nThe latest sale gives LegalZoom a cash boost and adds flexibility for future investment and shareholder returns, COO and CFO Noel Watson said. LegalZoom plans to lease office space elsewhere in Austin, though it has not disclosed the location.\nThe sale comes amid shifts in corporate office strategies in Austin as tech firms in particular look to shed or reconfigure real estate amid remote work and cost-cutting.\nTake Meta Platforms. After seeking\nsubtenants\nfor portions of its downtown Austin office space, the Facebook and Instagram owner recently\ncommitted almost $3 million\nto build out part of its 120,000-square-feet space at 300 West 6th Street, though it remains unclear for whom.

        "content": "2024 was a year of major real estate legislation; 2025 is the year of the lawsuits trying to undo them.\nIn the months leading up to its passage in November, we tracked the progress of the Fairness in Apartment Rental Expenses Act, which required landlords to pay the commissions of the brokers they hire. The Real Estate Board of New York is now suing to block the law, arguing it wrongfully interferes in private contracts and is preempted by state law.\nState officials are lining up to support the city in its fight to enact the law; Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s office even approached Council member Chi Oss\u00e9 about making a video to support the FARE Act, which was\nposted\non social media on Wednesday. The measure is supposed to take effect in June, but REBNY has filed a motion to prevent that while the lawsuit makes its way through the courts. We\u2019re still waiting for a decision on that.\nThat\u2019s not the only real estate-related suit on the books.\nLast week, City Council members and others\nfiled a lawsuit\nseeking to annul the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity (and along with it, the two other City of Yes zoning actions). The complaint alleges that City of Yes violated city and state environmental laws by failing to do a comprehensive review of the impact of the zoning changes.\nThe unraveling of either of these laws would be a huge deal. I know better than to predict the likelihood that either case will prevail, but the litigation likely means we\u2019ll be talking about these issues for the foreseeable future.\nIn other lawsuit news, a judge\nthrew out\na complaint seeking to halt negotiations over resetting the ground lease rent at Carnegie House. The building\u2019s shareholders could appeal, but they are also hopeful the state legislature will come to the rescue via a law that would cap ground lease rent increases.\nIf that happens, we can likely expect yet another lawsuit from the real estate industry. REBNY has said the proposed law represents an unconstitutional intrusion into private contracts.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nMayor Eric Adams announced Thursday that he will not run in the June Democratic primary and will instead seek reelection as an independent. Will this in any way win him more support from the real estate industry? Are you someone who has been on the fence about supporting Adams? Are you already fully committed to supporting someone else? Are you unsure? I want to hear from you. Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nPublic relations firm Risa Heller has rebranded as just Heller. \u201cWhat began in 2011 as a one-woman operation has since grown into a powerhouse team of 30 talented professionals across offices in New York and Los Angeles,\u201d the company said in an email announcing the change. Apparently, a show based on the firm is also in production, starring Lizzy Caplan,\naccording to Deadline\n. If the showrunners need any advice about casting annoying real estate reporters, I am very available to provide guidance.\n\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 The likelihood that former Gov. Andrew Cuomo will gain the support from the New York Working Families Party, even if he wins the Democratic primary, is \u201cclose to none,\u201d party co-director Ana Maria Archila told\nCity &amp; State\n. \u201cAny candidate is welcome to make the case to the Working Families Party,\u201d she told the publication. \u201cKnowing Andrew Cuomo\u2019s record of sexual harassment, corruption, and abuses of power the likelihood he earns the Party\u2019s support is close to none.\u201d (Cuomo has denied sexual harassment allegations. He has not yet sought the WFP\u2019s endorsement.)\n\u2014 Gov. Kathy Hochul on Thursday signed another budget extender, which will fund the state government through Monday,\nNewsday reports\n. Sen. Liz Krueger, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said she is \u201ca bit more optimistic\u201d that the state budget (which was due earlier this week) will be approved late next week, before the legislature breaks for Easter and Passover. \u201cI feel like we have been making some progress over the last few days,\u201d she said.\n\u2014 Spending on lobbying in New York last year reached an all-time high of $377 million,\nthe Times Union reports\n. Genting Group, which runs Resorts World New York City in Queens, was the third-highest spender at $3.2 million. Queens Future, formed by New York Mets owner Steve Cohen, spent $2.6 million, earning him fifth place on a list put together by the state Commission on Ethics and Lobbying in Government. Real estate was the fourth most popular subject listed on lobbying records.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Thursday was\n$9.9 million\nfor a 3,890-square-foot townhouse at 19 Downing Street in the West Village. Tamer Howard of\nThe Corcoran Group\nhad the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$6.95 million\nfor a 15,000-square-foot industrial property at 60-10 Maurice Avenue in Elmhurst.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$110 million\nfor an 11,480-square-foot condominium at 111 West 57th Street in Midtown West. Nikki Field and Benjamin Pofcher of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 29,128-square-foot, 8-story, 74-unit residential project at 3963 Saxon Avenue in Kingsbridge. Nikolai Katz filed the permit on behalf of Yosef Beer.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "Century City\u2019s status as a bright spot in the generally dim commercial real estate market in Los Angeles will get a test as it prepares for the departure of Disney from the campus that gives the district its name.\nRupert Murdoch and son Lachlan will face the challenge of filling a hole at 10201 West Pico Boulevard left by the biggest tenant in a rental operation that takes in as much as $50 million from tenants, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n.\nThe pending vacancy is the result of Walt Disney Company\u2019s $71.3 billion acquisition of Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox in 2019. The deal called for Murdoch and his Fox Corporation to keep the Fox Studio lot, with Disney committed as a tenant for a minimum of seven years. That kept the campus full in the shadow of the office towers that have thrived on law firms and financial outfits while downtown Los Angeles has shriveled in recent years.\nDisney has indicated it will move out when the seven-year minimum term is up next March.\nThe Fox lot was the genesis of Century City, with the office high-rise towers, a sprinkling of low-rise condos and the Westfield Century City mall growing around the operation over decades.\n\nMore recently, the globally renowned Reuben family took over the Fairfield Century Plaza\ndevelopment\n, which has brought a second hotel and two high-rise towers to the district.\nMurdoch will face a challenge in filling the studio lot, where marquee films such as \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d were made and the writers for \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d still work. The media mogul retained Fox Sports and Fox News when it sold off 20th Century Fox, and those entities occupy some space at the lot.\nFox is headed up by Lachlan Murdoch, the eldest son of Rupert. The company has been working on a $1.5 billion plan to add sound stages and other features to the Century City lot.\nDisney, meanwhile, has been consolidating its Los Angeles-area operations to its corporate base of Burbank, where it operates its own studio lot along with TV studios for its ABC network and its animation unit.\n",

        "content": "Real estate investors are\ndownright scared\nof Chicago property taxes.\nAlmost everyone agrees Cook County\u2019s real estate tax system is in need of major reforms, and at least some believe Assessor Fritz Kaegi is to blame for its issues.\nThose issues: Commercial landlords in Chicago and homeowners in the south suburbs are both experiencing sticker shock each time they get their tax bills and have been for the past few years.\nProperties are assessed triennially in one of three horizontally divided portions of the county: the southern, central and northern triads. That means every year, people in one slice of the county see jumps in value while the rest wait their turn, not sure what to expect.\nThe assessor\u2019s current valuation methods are difficult to understand. To complicate matters further, the Cook County Board of review, which hears appeals from property owners, relies on its own data and often approves significant slashes to values. For investors, the uncertainty is too much to bear.\nAll kinds of solutions were on the table at an April 2 event billed as the assessor\u2019s annual investor day. There, veteran developer Mike Reschke suggested changes to how commercial property is evaluated, while Elizabeth Holland, CEO of real estate investment firm Abbell Associates, said data sharing among all entities \u2014 including the tax assessor and the Board of Review \u2014 would be key. Micahel Fassnacht, the former head of World Business Chicago who\u2019s now leading marketing for Clayco, also chimed in from a panel.\nTheir ideas aren\u2019t the first potential reforms. A December analysis published by Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle had dozens of improvements to the system from independent consultants.\nKaegi sought Wednesday to make investors more confident in the county, telling the audience that his office \u201cembraces 100 percent\u201d of the reforms.\nIn an exclusive interview with\nThe Real Deal\n, he expanded on his plans.\nEditor\u2019s note: this interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nThe Real Deal:\nWhat is your reaction to Mike Reschke\u2019s idea to create a simplified property tax estimation formula that would allow property owners to plug in data like rental rates and vacancies and submit their estimated assessment for consideration and approval?\nFritz Kaegi:\nThe first principle is accuracy. We all share a property tax system together and any commercial assessment needs to be accurate so that it\u2019s fair to all the other taxpayers. But the way I think about it, and I think the way Mike thinks about it is, \u201chow could we make it more simple while still being accurate?\u201d\nWhat I\u2019m trying to encourage with Mike is talking to a lot of other industry participants in the hospitality industry and in the office industry, to say, \u201cHey, it would be worth our while, even if we paid a little bit more, if we had more certainty and more predictability. That would allow us to attract more capital, maybe get better value for our investments and cause more projects to happen that aren\u2019t happening because there\u2019s too much uncertainty.\u201d\nThe commercial assessment report that President Preckwinkle oversaw, that was prepared in December, has several good steps to get us on the road there because it talks about coming to consensus on capitalization rates, on tax rates and on common data.\nTRD:\nAnd when you\u2019re talking about cap rates, you mean more agreement between your office and the Board of Review?\nFK:\nThat\u2019s right. The report released in December was the most comprehensive look at commercial assessments ever done by the county. \u2026\u00a0 One [recommendation] is before going into an appraisal [to start] by looking at transactions that have happened and come up with recommended cap rates that we\u2019re all using, rather than having multiple different appraisers picking these out of thin air and arguing for them.\nTRD:\nHow many of the report\u2019s recommendations can be done from your office and how many would need to be done at the state level or outside of your purview? What are some of the first things that you can implement?\nFK:\nMost of the recommendations in that report can be adopted through countywide policy, so it does require us to be working together, but countywide policy doesn\u2019t require a change in law. The plan advocates for the passage of a state commercial data collection law \u2014\u00a0 we have been pursuing this for years.\nThe good news is \u2026 the physical descriptions bill, which is adapted from our data modernization bill a few years ago, has no opponents today.\nTRD:\nTell me more about that bill. What issues would it address?\n\nFK:\nThe physical descriptions bill would create a one-time snapshot and physical description of all commercial properties above a certain size that are rent-earning properties with more rich detail and more up-to-date detail than we have now. So if you have a warehouse, this is square footage, cubic space and information about features like loading docks that can give us a sense of whether it is a Class A, B or C building.\nThis allows us to sort things into better categories,\u2026 and it would only be required to be updated if there was major permit activity.\nThat would help improve the physical data that we\u2019re using significantly.\nTRD:\nYou also said that the mass appraisal system, which groups properties together, leads to some of that uncertainty. Would this bill address that?\nFK:\nHaving more commonly agreed upon data makes it easier. It\u2019s always going to be a mass appraisal system because there are 1.9 million properties that all have to be valued. And many other places in America do this just fine.\nTRD:\nAny cities you look to as models?\nFK:\nMaricopa County, Arizona, has a great IT platform that everyone works off of. It can handle a rich amount of data and detail. Maricopa is also very good at defending their assessments before appeals boards. That\u2019s something that we can learn from.\nHarris County in Texas, is also very, very good at that. So I talked to assessors there to draw upon what they do. One of the recommendations is that we staff up for assessment defense. While he was still alive, I asked Sam Zell, one of the most legendary real estate investors nationwide, which places should we draw from? He said these places don\u2019t have the lowest taxes but they are predictable: Washington, D.C., Boston and the state of Virginia.\nTRD:\nA report from the Chicago Tribune and the Illinois Answers Project\nfound $444 million in missed value last year.\nA lot of that\nwas addressed recently\n. What can be done to prevent that from happening again? What changes are in the works, if any?\nFK:\nThere have always been some properties in the county that were not being picked up through the imperfections of the permit system but we, during our administration, have more than doubled the rate of omitted assessments than the previous two administrations had achieved.\nWe\u2019ve updated the technology, we have more field people going out and inspecting properties than ever before, and we will keep getting better at this. While $400 million sounds like a lot, that\u2019s $400 million out of $700 billion in market value. We also want to allocate resources to the board review to defend our appraisals.That\u2019s gonna make a bigger impact for the average taxpayer.\nTRD:\nYou mentioned that the Gold Coast was the one neighborhood where values actually went down in the central triad but looking ahead to the northern triad, the wealthier areas are seeing growth in value, both on the residential and commercial side. Can you speak to those trends and what might be emerging here?\nFK:\nI\u2019m reluctant to read into that. That might speak to the fact that a lot of people paid high prices in the Gold Coast in the 2000 to 2010 time period and a lot of people have not had great returns since then. \u2026 What\u2019s going on at the very highest realms of the wealthiest people in the Chicago region is very different from what\u2019s happening with average homeowners in the rest of the region. In most of the rest of Cook County, people are looking for homes they can afford with their incomes. \u2026 If you see homes below $400,000 or $350,000, they\u2019re performing strongly in the market because there are not enough new homes being built. Up at the high end, in the Gold Coast, people may be choosing incrementally to go into the suburbs. I don\u2019t know if I want to make that call yet but certainly in New Trier, we\u2019re seeing strong performance in the highest end homes there. \u2026 I think that reflects inequity in our economy.\nTRD:\nAre there any other early observations from the Northern triad?\nFK:\nWe expect commercial to be up more than residential, partly because that commercial assessment report showed that initial commercial assessments were too low coming out of the Board of Review in 2022 and those need to be trued up. We\u2019re seeing healthy conditions in industrial, data science, multifamily, storage and data centers. Vacancy rates and apartments are setting records for transactions. \u2026 But some offices are still encountering a lot of vacancies.\nTRD:\nAnything to add?\nFK:\nWe 100 percent embrace the recommendations from that study in December. We\u2019re following through on the recommendations. There are work streams that are being overseen by the Civic Consulting Alliance for each of those recommendations and we\u2019re already delivering some of them to the Board of Review and working with them.\nTRD:\nHow far along do you think you could be with implementing those recommendations for the next triad?\nFK:\nAlready for the end of the Chicago triennial, we\u2019re acting on some of those recommendations: providing the Board of Review our estimates on tax rates, and we\u2019re also going to be providing suggested estimates for cap rates, and we\u2019ll be sharing more data. We\u2019re working off of most of the recommendations in the report already in the Northern Triennial and then for the Southern Triennial there\u2019s no good reason why we couldn\u2019t be working off them all.",

        "content": "Another Hoxton hotel is coming to Chicago.\nLondon-based Ennismore, parent company of the Hoxton brand, reached an agreement to open a second Chicago location as part of a planned 47-story tower at 193 North Columbus Drive, CoStar\nreported\n.\nThe project, led by Magellan Development Group and South Korean partner Hanwha Engineering &amp; Construction, would rise on a vacant parcel in the Lakeshore East neighborhood.\nThe location is expected to include about 240 rooms. More than 500 apartments are also planned for the development.\nThe project, known as Parcel O, has been in planning for years and still requires a construction loan to move forward, a major hurdle amid ongoing challenges in the capital markets.\nThe 182-key Hoxton hotel opened in the Fulton Market District in 2019. That location, developed by Shapack Partners, became known as a nightlife hub with two restaurants, a cocktail bar, coworking space and rooftop patio.\n\nLakeshore East, by contrast, caters to tourists and luxury condo dwellers, with views of Lake Michigan and proximity to Millennium Park, Navy Pier and the Magnificent Mile.\nIt would join two hotels embedded in skyscrapers already in the area: the 334-key Radisson Blu at the Aqua Tower and the 192-key St. Regis in Chicago\u2019s third-tallest building.\nIt also isn\u2019t the only hotel recently sizing up Chicago submarkets. Global Ambassador, a five-star hospitality brand launched by restaurateur Sam Fox, is\nin talks to anchor a 40-story mixed-use development\nat 170 North Green Street by CRG and Shapack Partners.\nThat project, approved for 150 hotel rooms, 275 apartments and 350,000 square feet of office, reflects developers\u2019 push to draw premium lodging brands as office leasing softens and competition tightens for anchor tenants in the city\u2019s hottest real estate corridors.\nIf the project comes to fruition, Hoxton\u2019s expansion would signal a bet on Lakeshore East\u2019s staying power as a magnet for tourism and residential growth. It also reinforces Ennismore\u2019s continued push in the U.S. and abroad: the company operates 184 hotels worldwide, with 140 more in the pipeline across 15 brands including Delano, Mondrian and Mama Shelter.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "A long-established commercial real estate powerhouse has joined with a tech startup in a search for enough space for a $1 billion research and development campus in the East Bay.\nHouston-based Hines, known for developments of Class A office buildings among other sectors of the market, is on the hunt with Pacific Fusion, a two-year-old specialist in clean energy.\nFremont-based Pacific Fusion has sought entitlements for a research-and-development facility at Alameda Point but now is eyeing a 15-acre site in nearby Livermore, the\nSan Francisco Business Times\nreported.\nAfter pursuing entitlements to build a new research and development facility at Alameda Point, Pacific Fusion is now eyeing a 15-acre site in Livermore to house its billion-dollar expansion.\nPacific Fusion has signed on with Hines as a development partner on the project. The two entities have narrowed the search down to the Alameda Point and Livermore sites, with a decision expected later this year, according to the Business Times.\nThe startup, with plans to hire as many as 250 workers, has apparently gotten a warm reception from city officials on both sites. It has raised about $900 million, and counts Reid Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn, as an early investor.\n\u201cBoth Alameda and Livermore offer extremely compelling reasons to be the home of this project, and we\u2019re grateful for the thoughtful engagement from both communities,\u201d a spokesperson for Pacific Fusion told the publication. \u201cOur goal is to choose the site where we can build most quickly and cost effectively \u2014 and of course, community support and partnerships are an essential part of this.\u201d\n\nAn initial announcement on plans called for a 220,000-square-foot facility covering up to 24 acres at Alameda Point. It signed a 24-month exclusive negotiating pact on the Alameda site, leaving open the possibility of hitting upon another site.\nPacific Fusion entered into a 24-month exclusive negotiation agreement with Alameda in February, estimating a need for $700 million worth of infrastructure improvements and various upgrades at the site it would want from the city.\nIt has made a similar proposal to city officials in Livermore.\nThe focus on the East Bay would keep Pacific Fusion near the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a federal research center that has taken the startup on as a collaborator.\nDemand for research and development space in the Bay Area has cooled in the past few years after a hot streak during the pandemic.\nLivermore\u2019s research and development sector notched an 8.2 percent vacancy rate at the end of last year while Alameda\u2019s held at 14.3 percent.\n\u2014 Jerry Sullivan",

Its population grew 43 percent to over 96,000 from mid-2020 to mid-2023, according to the U.S. Census.\nA comparable project is taking shape about a two-hour drive away in Fredericksburg, where Houston-based DC Partners plans to\nexpand the town\u2019s Main Street\nby way of a 22-acre project featuring retail, restaurants, tasting rooms and a small luxury hotel.\nGeorgetown officials have said they want the area\u2019s growth to be accompanied by \u201cleading-edge\u201d design and regional retail offerings.\n\nColumnar Vice President Logan Kimble told council members the plan is to build the site from west to east, phasing in infrastructure and vertical construction to reflect market demand.\nThe mix of housing types, including apartments, townhomes and single-family homes, is meant to offer \u201cmissing middle,\u201d entry-level and luxury options all in one package. Trails and green space will be a central feature, including a four-mile loop trail.\nThe site also includes a 120-acre tract owned by the Georgetown Independent School District, expected to be developed into a school campus.\nThe project\u2019s consultant team includes Lionheart Places for planning and design, Metcalfe, Wolff, Stuart and Williams LLP for land use, Gray Engineering and transportation firm BOE Consulting.\nColumnar aims to begin the project next year.\nIf approved, Heirloom would add to the city\u2019s growing list of large-scale developments. Georgetown has emerged as a regional manufacturing hub in recent years, attracting companies like GAF Energy, US Farathane, Hanwha Advanced Materials and ZT Systems.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

The suits are seeking class-action status.\nThe defendants improperly calculated interest on home equity loans, applying compound interest instead of simple interest during the period between when lenders requested court authorization for a sale and when that motion was granted, according to the lawsuits.\nThe lawsuits name major financial institutions as defendants, including Fannie Mae, Deutsche Bank, Bank of New York Mellon, Mr. Cooper Group and Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing.\nThe State of New York Mortgage Agency, a public benefit corporation providing low-interest loans to first-time homebuyers, was also named, as were five law firms and MTGLQ Investors, which specializes in purchasing pools of troubled home loans.\n\nAttorney Mark Anderson, whose firm filed the suits, claims \u201ccountless mortgage holders were deprived of surplus funds\u201d due to these alleged collective failures.\nOne highlighted case involves a woman who serves as legal guardian for her 89-year-old mother. During foreclosure proceedings on the mother\u2019s home, the lawsuit alleges improper interest calculations amounted to over $13,300 in overcharges.\nThe winning bidder at auction initially offered $785,000 for the property but then assigned the bid to lender Deutsche Bank, which purchased the home for just $207,000, according to the suit. With the seller\u2019s loan balance standing at only $168,000, the lawsuit claims she should have received approximately $591,000 from the sale.\nRepresentatives from Deutsche Bank and Bank of New York Mellon clarified to Bloomberg that their roles were limited to serving as trustees, with no direct responsibility for foreclosure processes. Goldman Sachs (owner of MTGLQ), Shellpoint and the law firm Eckert Seamans declined to comment, while other defendants did not immediately respond to inquiries.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Cardone primarily resides in a waterfront mansion in Golden Beach that he bought from fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger for\n$28 million\nin 2021. He receives a $50,000 homestead exemption on his property taxes.\nDuring a recent text messaging exchange with\nThe Real Deal\n, Cardone was coy about his political aspirations. But he boasted about Cardone Capital, his Aventura-based firm, luring investors for his real estate and cryptocurrency deals, when some of his peers are finding it difficult to raise equity due to a lagging multifamily market and uncertainty about the U.S. economy.\n\u201cSyndicators have all been sidelined,\u201d Cardone said. \u201cInstitutions cannot raise or make redemptions. I\u2019m thriving.\u201d\nCardone Capital recently acquired Integra Station, a 300-unit apartment complex completed in 2022 in Space Coast Town Center, a 64-acre mixed-use community in Melbourne, according to a press release. The property is being renamed 10X Space Coast Town Center, in line with the branding for Cardone Capital\u2019s multifamily portfolio, which spans 42 properties in five states with a combined 14,000 units.\n\nLast year, Cardone Capital dropped more than\n$300 million\nto acquire three multifamily projects in Fort Lauderdale.\nAside from his multifamily focused real estate firm,\nCardone\nhas built a network of money making enterprises built on his braggadocious persona and salesmanship. Cardone recruits mom-and-pop and high net worth investors via his social media accounts which have nearly 18 million followers in total.\n\u201cThe crowdfunding model works when done right,\u201d Cardone said. \u201cI\u2019m still raising money when no one else can.\u201d\nSince January, Cardone has used his social media presence as a bully pulpit to rail against Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Some of the video clips posted to Cardone\u2019s Instagram and X (formerly Twitter) accounts suggest he\u2019s contemplating running as a Republican in 2026 when Newsom is termed out.\nHe recently launched a website, 10XCalifornia.com, to help flip the state from blue to red by registering new Republican voters. On the homepage,\nCardone\nnoted that he \u201cvoted Democrat most of my life,\u201d but that the party is \u201cno longer representing regular people like me, but rather weird fringe groups.\u201d\nCardone would not comment to\nTRD\non whether he\u2019s serious about jumping into the race for California\u2019s top political post. Obviously, he would be a longshot candidate. Yet, Cardone is gung ho about a Republican possibly winning the governor\u2019s seat for the first time since 2006, when actor Arnold Schwarzenegger was reelected to a second term. The\nwildfires\nexposed the \u201cincompetence\u201d of Democratic leadership, Cardone said.\n\u201cCalifornia can be flipped in 2026,\u201d Cardone told\nTRD\n. \u201cOnly the most extremist [state residents] believe California is not on the wrong track.\u201d",

The Department of Buildings plans detail a 244,000-square-foot, 508-foot-tall property with 66 residential units; it\u2019s not yet clear if those would be rentals or condos.\nThe development would include 23 basement parking spots, ground floor retail space and rooms geared towards laundry, pet care, exercise and billiards.\nThe building would replace a four-story building on the corner lot between Third and Lexington avenues, which contains six apartments and a pair of commercial units occupied by a locksmith and a shuttered cleaners. The Wilfs filed permits last month to demolish the property and three adjacent structures.\nLeonard Wilf, the father of Skyline founder\nOrin Wilf\n, acquired the four properties in 2022 for a combined $50.1 million. Skyline did not return a request for comment from Crain\u2019s.\n\nThe Midtown-based firm\u2019s most prominent Manhattan holdings may be the identical five-story mansions at 13 and 15 West 54th Street, a landmarked property known as Rockefeller Towers. Skyline has also developed several notable Manhattan condo projects, including 200 East 79th Street.\nUnder a separate family entity, Garden Homes, the Wilf family recently proposed building an apartment community of\nnearly 500 units\nacross four buildings in a forest on top of a mountain in West Orange, New Jersey. The project would include 100 apartments for low- and medium-income residents but is facing resistance due to environmental concerns.\nElsewhere on the Upper East Side, Alchemy-ABR\nfiled plans\nfor a 28-story project at 1484 First Avenue that would span 161,000 square feet with 86 residential units.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Blackstone Mortgage Trust, the commercial lending arm of real estate investment giant Blackstone, is taking back the keys to a struggling Magnificent Mile office building after a loan extension and\na lender-led sale\nfailed to save it.\nThe 36-story building\u2019s owners, a joint venture of Chicago-based Golub &amp; Company and Los Angeles-based CIM Group, bought the property for $138 million in 2018 and later refinanced it with a $123 million loan. The borrowers scored an extension early last year after paying the balance down to $95 million.\nBut when the loan\u2019s new maturity date came and went in December, the loan\nwas transferred to special servicing with Blackstone Mortgage Trust.\nBlackstone Mortgage Trust hired CBRE to market the building last year but did not find any takers.\nAt the time, the New York-based firm was already aware that the 517,500-square-foot building would likely trade for far less than the loan\u2019s value, which is $238 per square foot.\nDespite investing $11 million on upgrades to the building first completed in 1976, Golub and CIM have failed to boost the building\u2019s occupancy since the pandemic, and it was at 61 percent leased when it was transferred to special servicing earlier this year.\nRepresentatives of Blackstone, CIM Group and Golub &amp; Co. did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nIt\u2019s unclear what the next steps for the building will be. Should Blackstone again seek to offload the asset it will enter an oversupplied market in Chicago. Office vacancy rates hit a new high of 26.5 percent by the end of March, according to CBRE.\n\nWhile institutional owners have shied away from Chicago, family offices have stepped in.\nSince 2021, The family behind European alcohol giant Campari Group has made over $100 million in real estate investments in Chicago across retail, office and multifamily.\nAlong with Chicago-based developer R2, Campari\nstarted construction last week\non the city\u2019s first publicly subsidized office-to-residential conversion, at 79 West Monroe.\nAnd just North of 444 North Michigan, Connecticut-based\nCommonwealth Development Partners\nis planning on an office-to-residential conversion of 500 North Michigan Avenue after that building\u2019s occupancy plummeted under its previous,\ncomplicated\nownership group.\nGolub and CIM, themselves, have also made a famous nearby office-to-residential play: they partnered on transforming the Tribune Tower into high-end condos.\nBut office-to-resi conversions\nhaven\u2019t proven to be a silver bullet for every office buyer\n.\n",

        "content": "The number of South Florida condo buildings on a Fannie Mae blacklist has more than doubled in the past two years, as the financial strain on condo associations worsens.\nNearly 700 condo communities in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties are on the list, marking almost half of the 1,438 buildings that the federally chartered mortgage finance corporation lists as ineligible in Florida, according to the\nMiami Herald\n.\nJake Marcus, a Miami-based attorney for Allcock Marcus, which compiled the data, told the newspaper that he believes Freddie Mac has its own official list.\nFannie Mae has not made its list publicly available to condo owners and associations. Only when a lender rejects an application from a buyer do owners typically realize that their building or association has been blacklisted.\nAbout 13,000 condo associations exist in South Florida.\n\nFannie Mae\nwill not back loans on units in condo buildings because of financial, maintenance or insurance issues, all of which are typically intertwined. Owners in these buildings may have a harder time selling their units because buyers are more hard-pressed to secure conventional financing. It\u2019s also detrimental for existing condo owners in need of financing.\nThe increase in buildings under financial strain is in part due to the state\u2019s\ncondo safety law\n, enacted after the\ndeadly collapse\nof the Surfside condo building Champlain Towers South in 2021. State lawmakers beefed up financial and safety requirements, requiring all condo associations to complete structural integrity reserve studies by the end of last year.\nStarting this year, they are required to fully fund reserves.\nCondo associations\nalso face milestone inspections once buildings reach 30 years, or sooner depending on their proximity to the coast, and every 10 years afterward.\nOlder buildings and those that have deferred fully funding their reserves or completing maintenance are facing more challenges, including securing insurance coverage they can afford.\n\u2014\nKatherine Kallergis\n",

        "content": "The rivalry between Eastdil Secured and Newmark is heating up.\nIn a new lawsuit, Eastdil alleges that members of its West Coast multifamily team that bolted for the competitor last month took a treasure trove of information on their way out the door \u2014 and even poached an active deal the company was working on.\nThe allegations ramp up the tensions between Eastdil and Newmark\u2019s capital markets group. The Newmark team, led by former Eastdil kingmakers Doug Harmon and Adam Spies, has been raiding top talent from their former employer. Both Harmon and Spies left Eastdil in 2016 for Cushman &amp; Wakefield; they then joined Newmark in 2023.\nEastdil on Monday filed a lawsuit in California\u2019s Orange County Superior Court claiming six brokers who left for Newmark last month breached their contracts and stole trade secrets.\n\u201cThe documents taken by defendants allow them to attempt to take Eastdil\u2019s current business and clients to Newmark, and also allow them to easily recreate documents at Newmark for future deals because they have Eastdil\u2019s templates and models,\u201d the complaint read. \u201cIndeed, for one of the deals for which defendants improperly took Eastdil confidential information, the client cancelled the listing agreement with Eastdil and is now using defendants and Newmark to bring the deal to market.\u201d\nThe brokers named in the suit are Geoff Boler, Lee Redmond, Jonathan Merhaut and Justin Shepherd (who worked in the company\u2019s Newport Beach office) and Eugene Chong and Blake Matsuda (from the Santa Monica office).\nTwo other brokers who left at the same time \u2014 Eve Loecher and Will Purcell \u2014 were not named in the suit.\nThe former employees are accused of accessing company documents before they left in order to take off with Eastdil\u2019s proprietary information.\n\nBoler, a ten-year employee who earned more than $1 million last year, allegedly sent an email from his Eastdil account to his personal account with nine of the company\u2019s \u201ccheat sheets\u201d for active deals attached.\nThese summaries contain key deal terms, including themes, pricing guidance and portfolio summaries that are essential for client pitches. Eastdil said these could be extremely valuable to a competitor like Newmark.\n\u201cIn fact, for one of the deals for which Boler emailed himself the cheat sheet, the client cancelled the listing agreement with Eastdil after Boler resigned and is now using Boler and Newmark to bring the deal to the market,\u201d the complaint read.\nAn attorney representing the brokers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Eastdil is suing for breach of contract and stealing trade secrets, and is seeking a restraining order and temporary injunction.\nBrokerages going against former employees isn\u2019t uncommon in commercial real estate. But it is extremely rare for Eastdil, which has a more high-minded company culture compared to other CRE shops.\nThere seems to be a good amount of tension lingering between Eastdil leaders and the Harmon team nearly a decade after the two split. And Newmark has been hiring so many of CEO Roy March\u2019s employees that Harmon\u2019s capital markets team is beginning to resemble a mini Eastdil.\nNewmark last year hired debt broker Jonathan Firestone, who had spent more than 20 years at Eastdil.\n",

The renderings show a striking 69-story rectangular glass building towering above nearby buildings.\nRay Yadidi\u2019s Sioni Group and AB &amp; Sons started acquiring properties for the development in 2007. The investors paid $49 million for a 21-story office building and $54.3 million for a vacant hotel at 993 Sixth Avenue.

The communities feature 16,000 residential lots and 600 acres of land for commercial development. They\u2019re all in various stages of development. The price works out to $50,000 per lot, $1.33 million per acre and $72.7 million per community.\nThe projects in Dallas-Fort Worth are Wildflower Ranch, Creekside, Aster Park, Northspur, Myrtle Creek, Furst Ranch and Redden Farms.\nWildflower Ranch is a 1,100-acre community in Northlake. It will have 3,300 homes at full build-out. Creekside is a 287-acre community in Royse City with 1,100 lots. Aster Park is a 414-acre community in McKinney that will have 1,100 homes. Northspur is a 700-acre community east of Terrell. It will have 1,500 homes. Myrtle Creek is a 1,260-acre community in Waxahachie that will have 2,500 homes. Furst Ranch, in south Denton County, will span 1,000 acres, and it will feature about 1,400 homes. Redden Farms is a 251-acre community in Midlothian that has 793 lots.\n\nThe Houston-area communities are Brookewater, Creekhaven and Wildrye.\nBrookewater is a 850-acre development in Rosenberg that will have 2,400 homes. Creekhaven is a 954-acre community outside Iowa Colony that will consist of 2,100 homes. Wildrye is a 528-acre community also near Iowa Colony that will have 1,400 homes.\nMirador is a 1,400-acre community in Southeast Austin. It will feature 2,500 single-family lots, 50 acres for multifamily and 75 acres of commercial development.\nStarwood\u2019s portfolio already includes at least 20 Texas master-planned communities, including Sunterra, which was named the top-selling community in Texas last year by real estate consultant RCLCO.\nTexas is a major player in the world of master-planned communities, making up 35 percent of sales among the top 50 master-planned communities in the country, according to RCLCO. Houston is the largest master-planned community market in the country. The master-planned community market has remained resilient in the face of high interest rates, as builders can offer incentives like mortgage rate buy-downs for new-builds.\n",

        "content": "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton\u2019s office is among several state authorities\ninvestigating\na controversial master-planned community project led by a Plano mosque.\nHe will bump into a former ally in his effords, as the project\u2019s developers hired the attorney who defended Paxton in his impeachment trial two years ago.\nDan Cogdell has been hired by the project\u2019s developer Community Capital Partners and the East Plano Islamic Center as scrutiny intensifies, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nThe veteran defense attorney from Houston is no stranger to the limelight. His other claims to fame include representing Sheila Kahanek in the Enron-Merril Lynch trial and Branch Davidian Clive Doyle after the siege at Waco.\nCogdell denounced Texas Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s investigations, along with his barrage of social media posts attacking the project, as \u201cgubernatorial hate speech,\u201d accusing the administration of using falsehoods to incite fear and violence against the Muslim community.\nHe offered to give Abbott a tour of the property or its affiliated mosque, but told the governor to \u201cquit tweeting lies, false information and nonsense.\u201d\nAbbott directed the Texas Rangers law enforcement agency to investigate Epic City and its backers for \u201c\npotential criminal activities\n.\u201d There are at least five state probes into the 402-acre development planned for Collin and Hunt counties.\n\nDevelopers say the project will include more than 1,000 homes, a mosque, a school, apartments, senior living and sports facilities. Over 500 lots have already been pre-sold.\nNo criminal charges have been filed, and Cogdell said the state has not identified any specific wrongdoing. But Abbott\nclaims\nthe group has failed to obtain necessary construction permits and gave them seven days to halt development or face legal consequences. Epic\u2019s leaders say no building has begun and no permit applications have yet been filed.\nOther state agencies probing the development include the Texas State Securities Board and the Texas Workforce and Funeral Service Commissions. Authorities have alleged potential securities violations, unauthorized funeral services and possible housing discrimination, charges the mosque and developers deny.\nImran Chaudhary, president of Community Capital Partners, said the project is intended to be an \u201cinclusive community\u201d open to all. But Cogdell said the state\u2019s rhetoric has already had consequences. Members have received death threats; their homes have been targeted; and mosque services have been disrupted, he said.\nThe legal defense signals a more aggressive response from Epic\u2019s leadership as state officials ramp up their messaging against the project.\nIn statements Thursday, the mosque and the developer reiterated their intent to comply with state and federal law and accused the governor\u2019s office of demonizing \u201claw-abiding Texans\u201d based on religion and politics.\n\u2013 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Masaveu Real Estate US beefed up a West Brickell development site after purchasing an adjacent property for $15.5 million.\nAn affiliate of Masaveu, the American arm of Spanish conglomerate\nCorporacion Masaveu\n, led by Chairman Fernando Masaveu Herrero, acquired a 0.3-acre parcel with a three-story commercial building at 268 Southwest Eighth Street in Miami, records and real estate database Vizzda show.\nCompleted in 1964, the vacant 16,815-square-foot building was previously leased to Okey Dokey food hall. The seller, an entity managed by Nathanael Cohen and Yonel Fellous in Miami, evicted Okey Dokey in February, court records show.\nCohen and Fellous own Miami-based luxury furniture retailer Modani Furniture with a celebrity clientele that includes Lady Gaga and Lebron James, according to published reports. In 2015, the pair\u2019s entity paid $5.5 million for the\nWest Brickell\nproperty, records show.\n\nMasaveu also owns a neighboring nearly half-acre lot at 242 and 250 Southwest Eighth Street. The firm bought the property for $14.7 million in 2022, and last year Masaveu demolished two small commercial buildings that were on the site, records show.\nMasaveu representatives declined to comment about the company\u2019s development plans. The firm\u2019s nearly 0.8-acre assemblage is zoned for 150 units per acre and for projects up to 48 stories in height. Masaveu is also seeking to boost the density of the lot acquired in 2022 through a transfer of air development rights deal.\nThe city of Miami has a process that allows the owners of commercial properties that have been designated historic or are within historic city districts to sell the\nair rights\nabove their buildings to developers seeking to increase the number of units and floor-to-area ratio of planned projects on properties zoned for high-rise development.\nDr. Just Brahmatewari, the owner of a one-story retail building in Miami\u2019s historic\nMiMo District\n, transferred air rights in December representing 22,050 square feet and 48 condo or apartment units to the Masaveu entity that owns the half-acre lot on Southwest Eighth Street, records show. The sale price is not disclosed in the deed.\u00a0Masaveu\u2019s U.S. portfolio consists of two hotels in southern California, two office buildings in Washington D.C., an office building in Houston and Courvoisier Centre, an office project in Brickell Key. In 2014, Masaveu paid\n$146 million\nfor the two-building property.",

The Des Plaines City Council gave the project its first green light in March and is expected to cast a final vote Monday, the Daily Herald\nreported\n.\nThe expansion would pave the way for the company to consolidate operations from its Skokie site and bring at least 50 full-time jobs to Des Plaines within four years.\nVetter acquired the Des Plaines property in 2017 with plans to redevelop the site, but construction was delayed, and a previous development agreement with the city expired. The company relaunched the plan last year.\nCity officials backed Vetter\u2019s request for a Cook County property tax break meant to encourage industrial redevelopment. The city council last month\nrecommended\nthe reduced assessment rate, which would apply only to the new building and cut Vetter\u2019s annual tax bill by roughly $3.7 million for 12 years.\n\nVetter executives said the project would not be financially viable without the incentive. The Cook County Board will still need to approve the measure.\nMost aldermen voiced support for the proposal but 5th Ward Alderman Carla Brookman voted against both the development and tax abatement.\nShe argued the city missed an opportunity to buy the land for public use years ago and questioned whether a factory is the best fit for the site. Brookman also raised concerns about noise impacts on nearby homes, a point 8th Ward Alderman Mike Charewicz countered by noting the company\u2019s plans to build fencing as a buffer.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

Thirty Ink nevertheless had crafted a plan that would have seen union workers get 40 percent of the work, he said, contending that the Nor Cal Carpenters Union, also known as Local 22, had signaled satisfaction with the plan initially.\nSmith called out union boss Jacob Adiarte in announcing Curry\u2019s decision to cancel the project.\n\u201cUnfortunately, our generous and completely unnecessary approach has been deemed unacceptable by Jacob Adiarte, who has personally gone out of his way to make it untenable for us to build in San Francisco,\u201d he told the Chronicle.\n\nSam Singer, the union\u2019s spokesperson, took issue with those claims.\n\u201cEither you want to do what is right or you want to undercut the labor standards and hurt working men and women,\u201d Singer told the publication. \u201cLocal 22 of the Carpenters Union will not let anyone, even an NBA superstar, undercut labor standards.\u201d\nThirty Ink\u2019s plans called for a 25,000-square-foot property with offices and lab space, with a residential unit for visitors and some space for community events and arts activities.\nThe matter has been declared \u201cdead\u201d by Curry\u2019s team, but union representatives floated the possibility of resuscitating the plan.\nA statement from Curry\u2019s team indicated the perennial all-star might look for another shot altogether.\n\u201cThe Thirty Ink HQ would have represented something far greater than a building; it would have been the next step in the revitalization of the Dogpatch neighborhood and an undeniable symbol of our long-term commitment to purposeful growth and community engagement in the Bay area,\u201d the statement read.\n",

Plans call for an unspecified number of affordable units ranging from studios to three bedrooms.\nA go-ahead on the plan would require approvals from the planning commission and City Council of Newport Beach.\n\nThe proposal comes from David M. Ellis and Romy Simone Ellis, both of whom serve as trustees of the Ellis Family Trust, which co-owns the existing, 112,000-square-foot building on the site. The Newport Beach Chamber of Commerce also is a co-owner, according to CoStar.\nThe Ellis plan isn\u2019t the only one to glimpse the redevelopment potential for Newport Center commercial sites into multifamily properties. The owner of nearby 12 Corporate Plaza recently\nfiled plans to raze\nan 18,000-square-foot low-rise office building there to make room for a 76-unit apartment complex. The would-be developer, identified in documents at Lori Junkins, is an owner of the existing building on site.\nRelated Companies last year pitched the idea of\ntearing down a movie theater\nin the area to build a pair of condominium towers with 140 units at 210 and 300 Newport Center Drive.\nNewport Beach has been working to increase affordable housing, with a state-mandated plan to build 4,845 homes by 2029, including 2,386 affordable units for low- and very low-income households.\n",

Such moves often come with the condition of a certain number of units being affordable.\n\nThe mayor said the plan is to focus on \u201chigh-resource\u201d stretches of the streetscape along east-west commercial corridors.\nIt would allow 65-foot buildings on California, Clement and Balboa streets while height limits on Geary, Taraval and Judah streets as well as parts of Noriega Street, would be raised to 85 feet.\nVarious trade and residents\u2019 advocacy groups have begun weighing with kudos and catcalls for the plan.\nAnnie Fryman, director of special projects at the urban think tank SPUR, said she was especially happy to see the rezoning focused on four- to six-story buildings in \u201clow density residential areas.\u201d\nState Sen.

The brokerage will continue handling leasing and property management.\nThe property sits at the corner of Post Oak Boulevard and Hidalgo Street and was previously owned by MetLife Real Estate Investors. Its taxable value is pegged at $68.1 million, according to the Harris Central Appraisal District. The sale price was not disclosed.\nPlanned upgrades include a fitness center, coffee bar, lobby refresh and exterior enhancements. Braun said the goal is to meet the evolving needs of tenants and build on the existing amenity package, which includes 24/7 security, a tenant lounge, grab-and-go market and dedicated parking.\n\nTenants at the building include law firm Spencer Fane, KLX Energy Services, Neste US and a Common Desk coworking space, which was retained by parent company WeWork when it exited bankruptcy last year.\nBraun is experienced with upgrading older buildings for modern users. The company recently completed a multi-year renovation of 53 West, a mixed-use development next to the Galleria. That project included overhauling office interiors, updating ground-floor retail storefronts, and improving walkability with lighting and outdoor seating.\nThe property is part of a broader three-building campus that also includes 3000 Post Oak Boulevard, vacated last year by Bechtel, and 3050 Post Oak Boulevard. Its stable occupancy and central location are bright spots in an otherwise uncertain office market.\nWest Loop\u2013Galleria, the submarket that includes Braun\u2019s building, posted its highest net absorption in over two years, according to CBRE. The building is 18 percent vacant, but the submarket\u2019s vacancy was nearing 28 percent in the first quarter, higher than Houston\u2019s overall office vacancy rate of 24.2 percent.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "The Los Angeles City Council took another step toward giving affordable multifamily housing developers a break they\u2019ve long been pushing for when it comes to staircases.\nThe city\u2019s legislative body recently voted 14-0 to do away with a requirement that all apartment buildings have two staircases for entry and exit, the Los Angeles Daily News\nreported\n. The council now seeks new regulations from city agencies to allow for single staircases in apartment buildings up to six stories.\nCouncilmembers Nithya Raman and Katy Yaroslavsky initiated the action, which will require a final vote based on reports from city agencies.\nBackers of the move contend that eliminating the requirement for a second staircase will lead to savings on construction. A second stairway often limits possibilities of floor plans and methods of providing required exposures to natural light, adding to the cost of bringing housing to the market.\nThe change could lower the cost of construction, yield bigger apartments and make buildings more beautiful while maintaining safety, Raman told the outlet.\n\nThe ability to build bigger apartments with more bedrooms is a key to the push. A recent study based on the state-mandated Housing Element, which calls for the addition of about 450,000 residential units in the City of Los Angeles over the next five years, found that less than 20 percent of units have three or more bedrooms, while 70 percent of owner-occupied homes in the city have three or more bedrooms.\nCities across the U.S. have recently begun to reconsider regulations on stairways in multifamily buildings. Some public safety organizations and executives contend that cutting out a second stairwell could bring risks for residents and first responders.\n\u201cWhen you start to get to a fifth and sixth story, in some areas, that really pushes the ability of the fire department to reach those people,\u201d said Jon Hart, a fire protection engineer at the nonprofit National Fire Protection Association.\nHart noted that New York is one of several cities that allows a single stairway under limited conditions rather than as a blanket policy or regulation.\nRaman said her concerns about safety were satisfied in discussions she had with representatives of the Los Angeles Fire Department.\n",

The price equates to $227,900 per unit. TLC Management was the seller.\nMeanwhile, New Jersey-based Antheus Capital shelled out $20.5 million ($165,300 per unit) for a 124-unit property at 5550 South Dorchester Avenue in Hyde Park. Laramar Group was the seller.\nThe deals marked profitable exits for the sellers.\nChicago-based TLC Management bought Drexel Towers in 2007 for $10.6 million. The firm invested \u201cmultiple millions\u201d into renovations, and the sale was a financial success, CEO Stuart Handler said. Newmark broker Andrew Daitch represented TLC.\nThe buyer in that deal, Lincoln Avenue, specializes in rehabbing subsidized housing to increase rent values before selling associated tax credits to corporate and financial buyers. The firm owns more than 170 properties across 28 states.\n\nAntheus Capital\u2019s acquisition of the Hyde Park property adds to its large South Side portfolio, including the 1,869-unit Lake Meadows complex in Bronzeville. The seller, Laramar Group, bought the Dorchester building in 2016 for $14.7 million.\nThe purchases reflect ongoing interest in Chicago\u2019s South Side rental market, particularly in areas like Hyde Park, where demand is bolstered by University of Chicago students.\nMore broadly, there\u2019s a nearly 120,000-unit deficit in affordable rental housing citywide, according to a 2023 report from DePaul University, and that demand is driving investor activity.\nDevelopment is still hindered by high construction and financing costs, with limited supply creating new opportunities for market-rate and subsidized housing operators.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "A town that attempted to takeover a struggling suburban Chicago shopping mall via eminent domain was hit with a lawsuit this week from the mall\u2019s owner, Namdar Realty Group.\nNamdar alleges Calumet City, a town on the border of Illinois and Indiana, improperly used eminent domain as a scare tactic to get tenants at the River Oaks Mall to leave and depress the value of the shopping mall.\nNew York-based Namdar, led by founder and CEO Igal Namdar, has owned the 1.4 million-square-foot shopping mall since 2017.\nA notice that the city was pursuing the use of eminent domain to take over the mall was sent out to retail tenants in late September. It came after negotiations over the city\u2019s purchase of the mall from Namdar fell apart because the two parties couldn\u2019t agree on the fair market value of the property.\nLast summer, Namdar reportedly stepped away from a deal to sell for a price in the range of $4 million to $7 million, which would be $2.85 to $5 per square foot. Calumet City Mayor Thaddeus Jones said Namdar was asking $10 million, or $7.14 per square foot, at the time.\nIn response to the city\u2019s negotiations, Namdar presented his own valuation of the property, claiming it is worth $40 million, or $28.50 per square foot. However, the city strongly disagreed with the owner\u2019s valuation of the center,\nprompting officials to consider alternative actions.\nThe city made a final offer of $13.2 million, or a little under $9.50 per square foot.\nOfficials then moved ahead with the eminent domain process, which illegally interfered with Namdar\u2019s contracts with tenants, and slandered the property\u2019s title, Namdar\u2019s lawsuit alleges. Calumet City officials also failed to properly notify the mall tenants of the city\u2019s requirement under state law to support tenants in relocating, the lawsuit claims.\nThe lawsuit did not specify which, if any, tenants did not re-sign leases as a result of the proposed takeover, but it states that the company suffered at least $50,000 in damages.\n\nEven with a notice sent out to tenants, the takeover was not set in stone. As mentioned in the letter, the eminent domain action still needed approval from the Illinois General Assembly, as required by state law.\nThe city has long eyed the struggling property and unveiled a $110 million plan for the site in July, which would integrate retail, dining and residential spaces. A key feature of the proposal was a three-level go-kart track from Supercharged, a company based in New Jersey.\nAt least two developers are interested in the plan, Jones said at an October City Council meeting, although he did not specify which developers those were.\nOne alderman voted against the proposal to take over the mall via eminent domain because a developer for the project had not been identified.\nCalumet City isn\u2019t the only municipality in Chicagoland looking\nto repurpose a shopping mall.\nThe Village of West Dundee has been buying portions of the Spring Hill Mall over time, though firm plans have not been unveiled.\nThe Village of Bloomingdale spent $17 million to buy the Stratford Square Mall with plans to transform the property into\na mixed-use development known as The Grove\n.\nSimilar to the Calumet City mall turmoil, not all mall takeovers have gone smoothly. Plans to redevelop the Charlestowne Mall, a defunct suburban shopping mall in St. Charles stalled for a second time in September as the village announced a second buyer\nhad backed out of plans to purchase the property\n.\n",

Griffin\u2019s is second only to the former Emir of Qatar, who owes $984,000 connected to a compound on East 72nd Street.\nGriffin and the former monarch\u2019s bills add to the\n$37 billion\nthe city gleaned in taxes last year \u2014 the highest total on record, according to a report from the Real Estate Board of New York. That total is about half of all local taxes collected in the city and roughly a third of the city budget.\nDespite the eye-popping totals, homeowners pay the least amount of property taxes, compared to multifamily buildings, according to a study by the\nCommunity Service Society and the Progress and Poverty Institute\nreported by the City\nearlier this week.\nResidential properties with three units or fewer are charged less than 1 percent of their value in taxes, while apartment buildings with more than 10 units paid roughly 4 percent. The report also found that property tax rates in neighborhoods with predominantly Black homeowners were double of those in areas where the majority of homeowners are white.\nA lawsuit pushing back on the city\u2019s 50-year-old system was revived by the Court of Appeals earlier this year. The case, initially filed in 2017, claims the system unfairly impacted racial minorities.\nNot so fast\u2026\nIt was a busy week for deals\u00a0 Billionaires\u2019 Row.\n\nAt 111 West 57th Street, a buyer signed a contract for a four-bedroom\n$56 million\npenthouse at the building, developed by JDS Development, Property Markets Group and Apollo. The pending deal topped Olshan\u2019s weekly signed contracts report, though its last ask was about $10 million below the price listed in the building\u2019s offering plan.\nDays later, the supertall\u2019s pinnacle penthouse hit the market for\n$110 million\n, Bloomberg reported on Friday. The quadplex, spread across the 80th to 83rd floors, spans 11,500 square feet and has five bedrooms, six bathrooms and multiple terraces.\nA few blocks away, disgraced top broker Tal Alexander\nofficially left his apartment\nat Harry Macklowe and CIM Group\u2019s 432 Park Avenue, ending his nearly five-year stint as a resident at the building. While Tal is at a federal detention center in Brooklyn awaiting his trial on sex trafficking charges, his estranged wife and child vacated the apartment after receiving a nonpayment notice.\nAlexander touted his residence at the supertall as proof that his lifestyle as a top broker mirrored that of his clients. The unit is now on the market for $55,000 a month.\nThe activity on 57th Street followed a boom in Manhattan\u2019s\nhigh-end market\nlast quarter, with the borough logging a new price peak and a significant uptick in deals, according to Miller Samuel\u2019s report for Douglas Elliman.\nSales of co-ops and condos in the luxury sector, defined as the top 10 percent, rose 30 percent year-over-year, while the average sale price of a home in the segment hit $10.3 million \u2014 the highest on record for the borough.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nUnit 8901 at Related\u2019s 35 Hudson Yards was the most expensive deal to land in city records this week when it closed for just under $14 million. Private equity and investment services executive Kerry Propper\nsigned a contract\nfor the five-bedroom condo, last asking $15 million, in January.\n",

The judge also dismissed the case with prejudice, meaning the case cannot be renewed, bucking the request of the Department of Justice.\nElected officials and former federal prosecutors viewed the DOJ\u2019s request as an attempt to keep leverage over the mayor to ensure compliance with immigration policies and other priorities under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\nShortly after the dismissal, Adams decided he would run in his reelection campaign as an independent and skip the Democratic primary.\nWhile Adams was let off the corruption hook, Nir Meir was\nlet out of prison\n. The former HFZ Capital Group spent more than a year on Rikers Island, but was released on a $1 million fully secured bail bond and put into 24-hour home confinement.\nMeir will live in an undisclosed residence in New York City, only permitted to leave his home for court appearances and pre-approved attorney visits.\nProsecutors allege Meir masterminded an $86 million fraud scheme that involved moving money out of accounts designated for HFZ Capital Group projects.\nAnother person leaving their home? Tal Alexander\u2019s estranged wife, Arielle, who\nvacated her 432 Park Avenue apartment\non Monday night ahead of the lease expiration.\n\nThe owner of the unit served Tal with a nonpayment notice for allegedly failing to pay rent for March, setting the former top broker up for possible eviction. The unit is on the market, asking $55,000 a month, according to StreetEasy.\nTal and his brothers, Oren and Alon Alexander, are being held on federal charges at Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.\nOn the outs from their job \u2014 presumably not their home \u2014 is Fortress Investment Group managing director Steve Stuart,\nThe Real Deal\nlearned this week. He\u2019s been with the firm since 2002, leading the company\u2019s new business origination for the credit and real estate team.\nStuart is believed to be\nleaving on good terms\nand the exit is mutual, sources said.\nFinally, New York Mets owner Steve Cohen welcomed his team and his new prized player, Juan Soto, at Citi Field for the first time this season on Friday. Cohen is trying to welcome a casino to the adjacent parking lot and appears to be making progress.\nState Sen. John Liu announced that\nhe would sponsor\na parkland alienation bill for the proposed casino complex west of Citi Field, despite representing a minority of the acreage covered by the Metropolitan Park plan.\nFor good measure, Cohen and Hard Rock International also partnered with Slate Property Group to\nadd 450 affordable housing units\nto their Queens casino plan, albeit on a different site.\n",

        "content": "To cap off a weird week in the mayoral race, let\u2019s talk\u2026 zoning?\nWe\u2019re entering a new chapter in the mayoral race: Mayor Eric Adams, having finally shed federal corruption charges, is readying to run as an independent in the November election, bypassing the crowded Democratic primary.\nOn Friday, the mayor accompanied U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on a tour of the subway and stood by while Duffy railed against congestion pricing. MTA Chair Janno Lieber tried but failed to join the tour,\naccording to Gothamist\n.\nAll this to say: We\u2019re 11 weeks away from the June primary and, with this latest development, potentially looking at a five-way general election in November,\nas Politico pointed out\n.\nWith the primary inching closer, candidates are doing their best to stand out.\nSen. Zellnor Myrie closed out the week by diving deeper into his housing plan, which calls for the construction of 1 million homes over the next 10 years. Myrie held a press conference in Midtown to highlight \u201cMega Midtown,\u201d which builds on the Adams administration\u2019s plan to upzone Midtown South. Adams\u2019 plan calls for rezoning 42 blocks in Midtown, which could net an estimated 9,700 units.\nMyrie wants to rezone the rest of Midtown too, taking advantage of the state\u2019s decision to lift New York City\u2019s floor area ratio cap on residential space. He projects that some 33,000 units could be built in a five-block area around Grand Central Terminal and that his plan could net up to 85,000 apartments in the neighborhood.\nIt\u2019s worth keeping in mind that developers have argued that the most stringent wage requirements under 485x, which would apply to projects with 150 or more units in Midtown, will lead to buildings\nwith fewer units\nto avoid those rules.\nFormer Gov. Andrew Cuomo has said that he would work with the state to increase the number of units built using 485x, though he hasn\u2019t specified how.\nWhitney Tilson\u2019s housing platform also calls for changes to the tax break.\nThe fact that housing plans with any level of specificity are being talked about \u2014 let alone in detail, as some candidates are \u2014 is a major departure from previous elections, when housing platforms were relegated to a few lines on a campaign website, amounting to little more than \u201cYes, I too care about housing.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nCrain\u2019s reports that the city has agreed to postpone a vote on the Brooklyn Marine Terminal redevelopment. What do you think the final plan will look like? Which stakeholders will be the most influential in shaping the plan? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nHospitality mogul Sam Nazarian spoke at\nTRD\n\u2019s salon series on Thursday. His new luxury hotel brand, the Estate, is focused on preventative medicine. It was a really interesting talk. I am admittedly not the intended audience for this kind of experience, but I have to think that some billionaires would not want to find out scary medical information while on vacation? Or be told that if they want to live forever, they better lay off the cognac and take an ice bath instead?\n\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\nFDNY officials say scaffolding collapsed outside 501 Ninth Avenue on Friday afternoon when a so-called spider crane was lifting another crane onto the roof of the building\n,\nWABC reports\n. Both cranes fell onto the scaffolding, causing it to collapse onto the sidewalk. No injuries have been reported.\n\u2014\nGov. Kathy Hochul won\u2019t weigh in on Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 decision to run as an independent in November\n,\nCity &amp; State reports\n. \u201cPeople do what they need to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI will always run as a Democrat if anybody\u2019s wondering.\u201d\n\u2014\nNYC schools could lose more than $2 billion in federal funding if they do not prove to the U.S. Department of Education that they are eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion efforts\n,\nChalkbeat reports\n.\nThe Department of Education has given schools 10 days to certify that they are doing away with DEI efforts. A spokesperson for the state Education Department indicated that it was reviewing the request. \u201cThe Board of Regents and State Education Department continue to work with New York\u2019s schools to increase equity, access, and opportunities in education for all New York State students,\u201d the spokesperson told Chalkbeat.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Friday was for a condo unit at 7 Bond Street for\n$8.6 million\n. The Noho condo is 3,100 square feet and was listed by\nCompass\u2019s\nMarta Maletz and Carl Gambino.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$175 million\nfor a development site at 576 Fifth Avenue. Extell\u2019s Gary Barnett was the buyer, securing another piece of his portfolio between West 46th and West 47th Street with plans to build a 33-story office tower,\nper reports\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $15 million for a townhouse at 54 East 80th Street. The Upper East Side home is 5,600 square feet.\nCompass\u2019\nHeather Domi, Ian Wolf and Mareli Maemets have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 115,941-square-foot residential building at 915 Erskine Street, Brooklyn. Daniel Heuberger of Dattner Architects is the applicant of record.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

And the buyer might trade in goods that simply don\u2019t cut it with the Wall Street set.\nBut the substance of a $257 million payday no doubt makes up for a lot of missing style points on BlackRock\u2019s deal to sell off an Inland Empire distribution hub to the discount retail brand formerly known as Burlington Coat Factory.\nThe retail chain, now known simply as Burlington, had been a tenant at the nearly 900,000-square-foot facility since it opened in 2019, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n.\nThe deal for almost $286 per square foot is the latest in a trend that has seen big tenants of warehouse and logistics centers buy spaces they\u2019ve been renting for years.\n\nThe Inland Empire is a major market for the segment, criss-crossed by interstate highways, local freeways, and rail lines that link to the two giant seaports and various air cargo facilities in Southern California. The facility that Burlington bought, for example, is at 21600 Cactus Avenue in the city of Riverside, within 2 miles of the 15 and 215 Freeways, and about 10 miles from the 10 Freeway.\nThe region, which takes in San Bernardino and Riverside counties on the eastern flank of Los Angeles, ran white hot for industrial space during the pandemic before cooling off more recently.\nDemand is once again ticking up, according to Mark Zorn of Colliers, who represented Burlington along with Cory Whiteman.\nThe market saw elevated demand in the fourth quarter, with leasing activity surpassing 10 million square feet for the third consecutive quarter, Zorn said.",

        "content": "The feud over one of Illinois\u2019 largest proposed housing developments has Springfield\u2019s attention.\nFour state legislators have pledged to introduce a proposal that would give Mundelein schools more leverage in negotiating how much the Wirtz family must pay in impact fees tied to its massive Ivanhoe Village project, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nAt issue is an $86 million gap between what school officials say they need to accommodate new students, including building a new school, and what the developers have offered to contribute.\nOnly municipal officials can negotiate those one-time fees with developers, a setup that\u2019s left the affected school districts sidelined.\nThe legislation would give school leaders a formal seat at the table. It was announced in a letter signed by state Sens. Adriane Johnson and Mary Edly-Allen, along with Reps. Daniel Didech and Laura Faver Dias, who all represent parts of the roughly 700-acre site in Lake County. The letter was addressed to Robin Meier, Mundelein\u2019s incoming mayor.\nSuperintendents of the local school districts welcomed the move. Fremont District 79 and Mundelein districts 75 and 120 have warned that the expected influx of at least 800 students from the future Ivanhoe Village \u2014 a 40 percent increase for one of the districts \u2014 will overwhelm schools and burden taxpayers unless the developers contribute more.\n\nThe districts\u2019 most recent shot over the bow was a pitch to just\nde-annex the Ivanhoe land\ncompletely.\nThe village\u2019s mayor, Steve Lentz, criticized the school leaders last month, saying they were\ntrying to \u201cshame\u201d the high-profile Wirtz family\ninto paying above what\u2019s required. He argued that state law doesn\u2019t permit one-time school construction fees.\nThe Wirtz family, which owns the Chicago Blackhawks and a beverage distribution empire, has remained quiet on the public dispute.\nIts plan for Ivanhoe Village includes nearly 3,600 homes, over 1.3 million square feet of industrial space, hundreds of senior housing units and major retail and office components. Full buildout is expected to take 20 to 25 years.\nWirtz Realty revised its housing mix earlier this year, planning a split between single-family homes, townhomes and rental apartments, with accessory-dwelling units also in the plans. If passed, the proposed legislation could shift how Illinois suburbs approach developer fees for megaprojects in the future and could make developers think twice before planning major suburban projects.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

Plans at the time called for the main offices of several county departments to be consolidated at the property, but none of them ever moved into any of the buildings.\n\nA document issued late last year said the county would consider leasing the entire property with a cap on rent at $200,000 per month \u2014 slightly more than dollar per square foot \u2014 or even more generous terms to a tenant that would bring jobs to the area.\nOtherwise, it said, a deal would likely go to a developer, with redevelopment proposals to be considered.

The design also maintains flexibility for a future high-speed rail terminal.\nIt reaffirms plans to include part of the former newspaper property at 508 Young Street. Washburne threatened to\nsell the property to a data center developer\nin February, citing poor communication from the city. He purchased it in 2019 with plans for a mixed-use development.\nThe city is\nconsidering buying the property\n, but its decision on the matter hasn\u2019t been made public.\nThe plan rebuffs a proposal by Hunt Realty, which had pitched\nmoving the convention center closer to Reunion Tower\n.\n\nRenderings show a convention center entrance facing City Hall and an upgraded connection to the adjacent Omni Dallas Hotel.\nThe layout includes a more compact footprint that would straddle Memorial Drive and nearly triple the amount of meeting room space to 260,000 square feet, while increasing exhibition space by 76,000 square feet and doubling the size of the ballroom.\nThe project is on track to stay within its $2.5 to $3.5 billion budget, said Rosa Fleming, director of convention and event services for the city. City staff have already completed utility and water line reconfigurations.\nThe City Council is expected to receive a project briefing next month.

        "content": "Texas regional retail real estate is practically as popular as a Taylor Sheridan TV series.\nA Dallas-based investment firm has acquired a fully leased retail center in Greenville, a Hunt County town about 50 miles northeast of Dallas, from a Hollywood producer with deep real estate roots.\nDunhill Partners purchased the 220,000-square-foot Greenville Promenade, at 6834 Wesley Street, from Bob Yari, a film and television producer known for his work on \u201cYellowstone,\u201d \u201cCrash\u201d and \u201cHostage.\u201d\nYari, also credited as executive producer on the Sheridan-created series \u201c1923\u201d and \u201cLandman,\u201d was a prolific real estate investor before turning to entertainment. A 2003 Variety article reported that Yari had financed a portfolio of retail and office assets across Texas and California.\nDunhill CEO Bill Hutchinson said the nearly 22-acre retail center, home to tenants like Spec\u2019s, Petco and Staples, fits into the firm\u2019s long-term strategy along the growing Interstate 30 corridor. Hunt County\u2019s population has surged nearly 19 percent since 2020, with neighboring Kaufman County ranked as the second-fastest-growing in the U.S.\n\nDallas-Fort Worth\u2019s retail market has hit record lows amid high demand and a stagnant development pipeline. Vacancy fell to 4.9 percent in the first quarter, according to Weitzman.\nHere\u2019s what else happened in Texas real estate this week.\nA Dallas-based multifamily investor is facing foreclosure on more than 2,000 units across 12 properties in northern Florida. Lender Acore Capital Mortgage plans to auction the properties, owned by\nLurin\n, with mortgages totalling $383.6 million.\nOffice developer Harwood International is facing foreclosure on another of its high-profile holdings in Uptown Dallas. The developer\ndefaulted\non an $80 million mortgage tied to Harwood No. 4, a 20-story office building at 2828 North Harwood Street, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service. Square Mile Capital, which merged with USAA Real Estate in 2023 to become Affinius Capital, provided the loan in 2019. Harwood recently worked out a foreclosure attempt on its Saint Ann Court development.\nMiami-based Starwood dropped\n$800 million\non 11 master-planned communities in Texas. It bought the portfolio, which includes 16,000 lots in the Austin, Dallas and Houston metro areas, from Hines.\n\u2014Rachel Stone\n",

Its lending strategy is mostly based on mezzanine deals, which provide borrowers cash without the security of a mortgage. While that allows the lender to charge more interest, it has come back to bite on a few big office deals, and could spread trouble into 321 North Clark Street.\nThe commercial development market was also dealt a painful blow as\nBank OZK seized the northern portion of Sterling Bay\u2019s Lincoln Yards\n, a North Side plot along the Chicago River between Lincoln Park and Bucktown once slated for a $6 billion megaproject. The development has long been in financial turmoil, with the bank\u2019s takeover marking the most significant setback to date.\nBlackstone also\nseized a distressed office tower\non the Magnificent Mile from borrowers CIM Group and Golub &amp; Co.\nWhat might help commercial landlords is property tax reform. Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi, among others, is often blamed for\nscaring institutional investors away\n. But he also said this week he knows the system needs to change, and\npresented some ideas\nthat could help eliminate year-to-year volatility on tax bills that has turned off many would-be buyers.\n\nIn the residential market, Compass points to controversy.\nOne of the brokerage\u2019s top Chicago dealmakers, Ben Lalez, is being accused by a former employee of collecting \u201ckickbacks\u201d from a lawyer and lender he allegedly steered clients toward using.\nAnd as talk swirls of Compass acquiring Warren Buffett\u2019s real estate brokerage, Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices, a couple former BHHS dealmakers in Chicago explained how the firm lost ground locally as they and a string of others left for Compass.\nFinally, the St. Regis has been Chicago\u2019s \u201c\nit building\n\u201d for four years since it opened. But\nbulk sales\n\u2014 and the often negative perceptions of them held by wealthy condo purchasers \u2014 have come to shape the building as downtown Chicago\u2019s recovery moves forward.\n",

        "content": "A handful of developers have found a loophole that allows them to avoid a public bidding process when picking up sites in Miami-Dade County.\nThe no-bid surplus land deals may offer developers a below-market price, or no price at all, for the properties. In our latest issue, Francisco Alvarado reports on\nhow this came to be\n.\nA county administrative order approved by the commission in 2022 authorizes any Miami-Dade official to back a developer\u2019s proposal for underutilized government properties. In exchange, the developers promise to build hundreds of affordable and workforce housing units or generate hundreds of jobs.\nAn affordable housing builder who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that developers are arranging these back-door deals before they are announced on any public agenda.\n\u201cThere is no advertisement for selling the land and there is no competitive process. You only hear about them once they are placed on a county commission agenda,\u201d the builder said. \u201cBy then, the deals have already been cooked.\u201d\nMiami-Dade commissioner Danielle Cohen Higgins backed Terra\u2019s no-bid purchase of nearly 11 acres of surplus land close to the South Dade Government Center in Cutler Bay. Her office worked with the county\u2019s Internal Services department to determine if the surface parking lots qualified as surplus. A majority of the site did, and the developer signed a lease with the county.\nTerra, led by David Martin, would get the bigger piece of the site for 99 years to build a 352-unit workforce housing project, with an option to build another 322 affordable housing units on the remaining land if Miami-Dade stopped using the land within five years, county records show.\nCounty memos initially stated that the county would receive $27 million over the 99-year term if only the first project got built, and another $71 million in rental income if the second project was constructed. But when the proposal was placed on a county agenda in September, the 99-year lease rent projections had grown by $129 million.\nThe county and Terra did not provide an explanation for the disparity. Two commissioners, Eileen Higgins and Ren\u00e9 Garcia, had issues with the proposal.\nThat led to a compromise. Cohen Higgins and Terra agreed to reserve 10 percent of the apartments for low-income residents.\nCohen Higgins defended the no-bid deal. She said in a statement that housing affordability is at \u201ccrisis levels\u201d and a \u201ctop concern\u201d for residents.\nNo-bid deals make sense when they address an immediate need or emergency, said Robert Jarvis, a Nova Southeastern University ethics law professor. An affordable housing crisis isn\u2019t an emergency, he said.\n\n\u201cIt could be a case of \u2018thank God someone is taking this property off our hands and it is not just sitting there unused.\u2019 But a bidding process is designed to uncover if someone else can come in and give you a better deal,\u201d Jarvis added.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nSoccer superstar Lionel Messi is in contract to buy four condos at Cipriani Residences in Miami, which is under construction, according to the\nWall Street Journal\n. What kind of celebrity discount could he be getting? Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\nCLOSING TIME\nResidential:\nDesigner Regine Traulsen and her husband, former New York City commissioner Bill Diamond, sold their longtime Palm Beach home at 220 Wells Road\nfor $16.2 million\n.

        "content": "Ex-employees of the Surrey Hotel are suing Reuben Brothers and Corinthia to get their jobs back.\nTwo employees, Donna McCammon and Vanessa Garcia, filed a lawsuit alleging that when Reuben Brothers bought the then-closed hotel in 2020, they were required under city law to offer jobs to workers who had been displaced. The lawsuit seeks to have their jobs reinstated as well as possible back pay or other damages.\nThe complaint hinges on the Displaced Hotel Service Workers Act, which Mayor Eric Adams signed into law in September 2020. Under the\nmeasure\n, when a hotel is sold or there is otherwise a change in the controlling interest, the new owners must offer employment to hotel service workers who have worked at the hotel in the year leading up to the change.\nThe employees are to be retained for 90 days, and if their work is satisfactory, kept on after that.\nIn March 2020, the hotel closed, and all workers were laid off. Shortly after, it filed for bankruptcy when the ground lease holder, Ashkenazy Acquisitions, filed for Chapter 11 after the hotel\u2019s operator missed payments, Bloomberg reported at the time. Reuben Brothers\npaid $150 million\nfor the hotel in December 2020. The business officially reopened in October 2024 as a 100-key hotel with\n14 condo units\non the top floors.\nThe Hotel and Gaming Trades Council, which pushed for the 2020 city law, repeatedly notified the hotel operator, Corinthia, of its obligation to offer employment to the laid-off workers, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cRather than doing the right thing in bringing back the workforce, they completely ignored repeated requests to bring those people back,\u201d Rich Maroko, president of the Hotel and Gaming Trades Council, said in an interview.\n\u201cThe union is going to keep fighting for its members until they get their jobs back,\u201d he said.\nDonna McCammon, one of the plaintiffs, said she had worked at the hotel for close to 20 years before losing her job in 2020. She said that the union helped her find a new job, but she and other long-term employees are hopeful to return to the Surrey.\n\u201cThey can\u2019t just let us go like that. We\u2019re human beings,\u201d she said.\nThe lawsuit is part of a broader battle the union is waging against the Surrey. In January, the union filed a charge against the hotel with the National Labor Relations Board, alleging it failed to rehire employees because of their involvement with the union \u2014 though it is unclear how grievances like this will fare under the Trump administration\u2019s shakeup of the NLRB.\n",

        "content": "New York\u2019s housing shortage could grow dramatically before the end of the next decade due to flooding.\nMore than 80,000 homes in the New York metropolitan area could be lost to flooding over the next 15 years, according to\ndata by\nthe Regional Plan Association\nreported\nby the New York Times. The report warns that climate change is poised to worsen the region\u2019s already critical housing crisis.\nThe study projects that by 2040, the housing shortage could reach 1.2 million homes as swaths of land become impossible to develop due to increasing flood risks. Long Island is expected to shoulder the worst of it, with more than half of the affected homes located on the island, Babylon and Islip among the areas at risk.\nIn New York City, waterfront neighborhoods in southern Queens and Brooklyn, including the Rockaways and Canarsie, face the highest risk. Staten Island and parts of Westchester County along the Long Island Sound are also vulnerable.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to need to build more housing to just replace what is lost in your own municipality,\u201d Moses Gates, the association\u2019s vice president for housing and neighborhood planning, told the Times.\nVarious flood mitigation measures are already underway throughout the city, including flood walls on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side and engineered berms in the Rockaways. After Superstorm Sandy in 2012, Staten Island implemented \u201cmanaged retreat\u201d by purchasing and clearing over 500 damaged homes to return the land to its natural state.\n\nA comprehensive plan to protect the entire city, however, remains decades away from completion.\nThe report recommends that cities and towns focus development in areas with lower flood risks near public transit and commercial centers. Revamping zoning codes would also be beneficial, as data from the National Zoning Atlas found that restrictions allow for only 580,000 additional homes \u2014 less than half of what will be needed.\nClimate experts suggest rethinking conventional housing, potentially abandoning the suburban ideal of standalone homes in favor of denser, more energy-efficient options.\nThe Regional Plan Association released a report\ntwo months ago\nsuggesting 19,000 homes in New York City proper were at risk of being lost from flooding by 2040.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Alfano sold $24 million in real estate last year and works in the Malibu, Pacific Palisades and other Westside submarkets.\nCompass also nabbed Robin Gaur from KW Hollywood Hills. Last year, he generated nearly $40 million in sales.\nSouth of Malibu, in Newport Beach, the brokerage brought on the Robert Mack Group, which is led by Robert Mack. The team was previously with Fiv Realty.\n",

        "content": "The city of Chicago isn\u2019t ready to pull the plug on a distressed slice of a riverfront redevelopment.\nThe northern stretch of Chicago\u2019s $6 billion Lincoln Yards megaproject is in limbo after developer Sterling Bay\nhanded the 27-acre parcel back to its lender\n, Bank OZK. City officials say the move violates its agreement with the city and jeopardizes the broader redevelopment plan, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe transfer of the property, located between Lincoln Park and Bucktown, resolved a\n$126 million maturing loan\nand triggered a formal notice of default from the city\u2019s planning department on April 1.\nThe notice cites a breach in the 2019 redevelopment agreement, which lays out how public tax-increment financing dollars are to reimburse private infrastructure investments at the site.\nBut the city is not rushing to scrap the deal, Planning Commissioner Ciere Boatright said. The city is prioritizing vertical development across the site and the TIF-backed agreement remains intact for now.\nBank OZK has said it will begin seeking a \u201cnew sponsor with sufficient capital and development expertise\u201d to fulfill the site\u2019s vision. The approved plan includes 14.5 million square feet of development, supported by more than $490 million in infrastructure improvements eligible for TIF reimbursement, including new roads, bridges and an extension of the 606 trail.\n\nSterling Bay and partner J.P. Morgan Asset Management still control the southern half of Lincoln Yards, but splitting the site across two ownership groups could complicate the current structure.\nA future developer of the northern parcel could scale back the development or seek a fresh redevelopment agreement with the city, changes that could unsettle the balance underpinning the project\u2019s infrastructure commitments.\nThose commitments must be met before any construction can begin. For example, Sterling Bay had to extend Concord Place just to build its eight-story life sciences lab building, which hasn\u2019t been occupied.\nWith $79.3 million in TIF funds sitting idle, primarily from expiring nearby districts, the city is waiting to see whether Bank OZK can attract a developer willing to meet the agreement\u2019s terms, or if the deal needs a full reboot.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Office landlord Paramount Group is under fire after disclosing payments to its chief executive officer over the last three years that were not previously reported.\nThe company paid CEO Albert Behler at least $4 million for personal expenses and business interests, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\nciting recent security filings. The company disclosed the payments for the first time in a proxy statement last week. It follows a filing from February that also disclosed previously unreported payments to companies in which Behler and his wife have personal stakes.\nIn the past three years, the company has paid more than $900,000 for Behler\u2019s personal accounting services. Paramount also paid more than $3 million to a jet-chartering company co-owned by Behler, $214,000 to a consultant who used Behler\u2019s wife\u2019s design firm and $220,000 for another use of the same design firm.\nPublic companies are typically required to annually disclose transactions above $120,000 involving people or entities related to the company. It\u2019s unclear if the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the company\u2019s dealings.\n\u201cParamount Group regularly updates its disclosures as part of its commitment to transparency and in response to shareholder feedback,\u201d the landlord said in a statement.\n\nAdditionally, the company paid $12,000 for wine from Behler\u2019s vineyard in Germany and $77,000 above a company limit for Behler\u2019s club memberships. His annual compensation in 2022 and 2023 was hundreds of thousands of dollars more than Paramount previously reported, which the company attributed to a \u201creclassification of certain payments.\u201d\nParamount, which owns 14 million square feet centered around New York City and San Francisco, has been under fire from company shareholders.\nTop Paramount executives earn disproportionately high pay packages related to returns and relative to other companies, according to a recent Green Street report, which called Paramount \u201cone of the worst performing office REITs over many time periods.\u201d Its stock price has dropped more than 60 percent in the last four years.\nIn the last five years, the company has also\nrejected\ntwo takeover offers without strategic reviews or explanations to shareholders, according to analysts.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A Manhattan boutique brokerage is expanding its reach.\nPlatinum Properties, a family-owned firm headquartered in the Financial District, launched its commercial arm, Platinum Commercial.\nThe new division will be led by Khashy Eyn, who founded Platinum Properties with his sister Dezireh Eyn nearly 20 years ago. Earlier this year,\nDezireh took over as CEO\nfrom her brother, who became the company\u2019s chairman.\nPlatinum Commercial has so far this year added 250,000 square feet of new leasing and sales business, doubling its existing business. Under the Platinum Properties brand, the firm has done over $2.5 billion in commercial leasing and sales since its inception in 2005.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a large amount of commercial transactions over the last 20 years,\u201d Eyn said. \u201cThe issue was, people would look at us as a residential firm when they went to our website, so we wanted to separate the identity of our companies.\u201d\nEyn said the firm had previously done much of its work on tenant representation, but has been adding landlord representation as it has grown the commercial business.\nNotable deals include Silverstein Properties\u2019\n$248 million purchase of 116 John Street\nfrom MetroLoft in 2021. The company also represented venture fund Liberty City Ventures in its 11-year lease of a 16,000-square-foot space at 33 Irving Place.\n\nPlatinum Commercial has been tapped to lease over 140,000 square feet of office space at 30 Wall Street, a 12-story commercial building that once housed Platinum Properties itself.\nThe wheels started to turn for Eyn during the pandemic, when the city was plagued with sky-high vacancy rates and an\noverall downturn in the commercial market\n.\n\u201cThere was a lot of opportunity for new players on the block,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a down market, there\u2019s an opportunity to make a name for yourself.\u201d\nSteve Evans, who has been with Platinum for nearly 18 years, will join the commercial division as managing partner.\nEyn said the intention is to grow organically and slowly in terms of both landlord representation and headcount.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be a 100-person firm, or a 50-person firm \u2014 we want to be 25 people, max,\u201d Eyn said of the commercial division.\nThe announcement continues a busy year for the Platinum group. In December, Platinum added\nKaren Gastiaburo\nas its new sales director, and Dezireh Eyn said this year will be the first that Platinum will be actively recruiting agents.\n",

The seller was also undisclosed.\nBroker Garrett Weston of Coldwell Banker Realty represented the seller and the buyer in the deal.\nThe six-bedroom, nine-bathroom house was initially listed last month for $28 million,\naccording to Redfin\n. It sold two days later for 7 percent less than its asking price. It had last traded in November 2023 for\n$24.5 million\n.\nThe last two sales of the home shattered local home sales records, according to the Business Journal.\nBut a report by\nThe Real Deal\nsaid the record holder for the priciest home in Corona Del Mar belongs to a former mansion at 401 Avocado Avenue known as the Big Blue House, owned by an Irvine family heir. In 2017, the home sold for\n$35 million\n, and was demolished three years later.\nThe more recent sale on Bayside Drive includes a contemporary home, built in 2021 on a quarter acre, facing the stream of boats coming in and out of Newport Harbor.\nThe house has 50 feet of private beachfront and shared ownership of one of the longest private docks on the West Coast, capable of accommodating multiple yachts up to 100 feet in length, according to The Oppenheim Group.\n\nThe three-story mansion has European wide plank bleached oak floors, illuminated floating staircases and floor-to-ceiling walls of glass looking past the harbor jetties out onto the Pacific Ocean.\nIt has a gourmet kitchen, butler\u2019s pantry, elevator, a master bedroom with a heated wraparound balcony, a heated outside patio with a zero-edge saltwater pool and spa, and an underground garage for six cars.\n\u201cWhat makes this home special \u2014 being newer construction on the water with the square footage that the home offers and having that size boat dock makes it a rare find,\u201d Weston told the Business Journal.\nLuxury sales in Corona del Mar have been heating up.\nIn July, a 9,100-square-foot house at 4527 Perham Road sold for $21 million, while a 7,500-square-foot house at 4539 Fairfield Drive sold for $18 million, according to the Business Journal.\nThis year, a 7,600-square-foot estate at 3308 Ocean Boulevard sold for $13.7 million, while most homes sold for between $2 million and $6 million.\nLast fall, builder and broker Lin He listed a four-story, 11,600-square-foot oceanfront mansion at 77 Shorecliff Road for\n$49.5 million\n, $28.9 million more than he paid for the home two years earlier.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

It will also close two worker cafes.\nMeta real estate managers called it \u201can opportunity to optimize our space usage.\u201d The date of the pending closures was not disclosed.\nWorkers from Dumbarton and 6520 Kaiser will be moved to the Menlo Park headquarters. Employees at 6504 Kaiser will bring their calculators to other buildings across the 1-million-square foot Fremont campus. The owner of the buildings was not identified.\nThe social media platform will lock the doors at its music room, in addition to the \u201cMeadows\u201d and \u201cSweets Over the Bridge\u201d cafes. Its \u201cHelpdesk and Ship Happens\u201d offices will be moved to unknown locations.\nThe contraction comes more than a dozen years after a leasing spree by a company then known as Facebook. After its first public offering in 2012, Facebook ran out of room at its Menlo Park hub.\nA subsequent real estate binge led to Fremont, where in 2017 it launched\nan office park\nby leasing two buildings from The Sobrato Organization before signing 14 more from Peery Arrillaga the next year. It\u2019s not clear if the buildings being vacated are owned by Arrillaga.\nElsewhere across the Bay Area, Facebook\nleased two new skyscrapers in San Francisco\nand 1 million square feet\nat a new office campus in Sunnyvale\n.\n\nThe social media giant then inked long-term leases at\nanother Sunnyvale campus once occupied by NetApp\nand 773,000 square feet of offices at\nthe new Menlo Gateway\nnear its original headquarters.\nThen, in conjunction with widespread layoffs, Meta realized it had gobbled more offices than it could chew, according to the Standard. Two years ago, the firm signaled it planned to exit 3 million square feet of unoccupied offices.\nIn Fremont, it subleased a 52,400-square-foot building to a pharmaceutical company,\naccording to CoStar\n.\nAfter the pandemic lockdowns, the firm left a San Francisco tower at 181 Fremont Street\nvacant\n. Two years ago, it subleased the former NetApp campus\nto Walmart\n. Late last year, it\nsubleased the\nMenlo Gateway campus to Snowflake.\nThen Meta Platforms made an odd reversal. The company, which in its latest annual report said it aimed to shed 2 million square feet of offices across the Bay Area,\ngrew its footprint instead.\nAt the end of last year, Meta occupied more offices than it did a year earlier, growing to 9 million square feet from 7 million square feet,\nthe San Francisco Business Times reported\n, citing a regulatory filing.\nThe company said in its most recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing it increased its employee headcount by 10 percent last year, suggesting the rise in occupancy could be tied to its growing workforce.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Tishman\u2019s last office investment came in 2019, when it acquired a long-term lease on the Morgan North U.S. Post Office building near Hudson Yards.\nThe company has been busy developing the 2.8 million-square-foot Spiral office building near Hudson Yards, and has been buying offices in other markets such as London, Austin and Paris \u2014 while also diversifying into areas like industrial and multifamily.\nBut the Soho deal would add Tishman\u2019s name to the list of investors who\u2019ve recently jumped off the sidelines and back into a Manhattan office market that had gotten frothy for some of the biggest investors.\nBlackstone, for instance, is\nnegotiating to buy a stake\nin the 1.9 million-square-foot 1345 Sixth Avenue. SL Green in November announced a deal for the office condominium at 500 Park Avenue for\n$130 million\n. The firm previously bought 450 Park Avenue in 2022 for\n$445 million\n.\n",

But foreclosures, devalued assets, and widespread market uncertainty mean the path forward is unclear.\nOn one hand, green shoots have appeared in the office market. But challenges persist for Class B and C offices, and office-to-residential conversions can prove tricky. The residential market, meanwhile, has experienced \u201c\nwhiplash\n,\u201d with the lack of inventory and higher-for-longer rates keeping the market down.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re thrilled to be back at Metropolitan Pavilion in Midtown on May 7, where we\u2019ll bring some of the industry\u2019s top names to the stage for\nour annual NYC Forum\n. The doors open at 10 a.m. and programming kicks off at 11 a.m., starting with a fireside chat from Steve and Alex Witkoff.\nSteve Witkoff founded Witkoff Group, the multi-billion-dollar family business responsible for 11 million square feet of commercial and retail real estate and an ownership interest in over 7,500 apartments \u2014 but now, while he attempts to negotiate peace in the Middle East, son Alex has taken the reins. \u2060\nThroughout the day,\nTRD\n\u2019s forum will break down the market, from drilling down into the next hot neighborhoods for residential development to sussing out signs of spring renewal for the office market. We\u2019ll take a look at what the mayoral race might have in store for real estate, hear from top tech entrepreneurs, and more.\n\nNotable names stepping onto the stage include Bilt Reward\u2019s Ankur Jain,\nMetroLoft\u2019s Nathan Berman\n,\nCBRE\u2019s Mary Ann Tighe\n, developer\nDon Peebles\n,\nJohn Santora of WeWork\n, and the star of Netflix\u2019s \u201cSelling the City\u201d, Elliman\u2019s\nEleonora Srugo\n.\nAlso joining the main stage this year is boxing legend-turned-real estate investor Floyd Mayweather, Jr., along with Ayal Frist, CEO of Mayweather\u2019s investment firm VADA Properties.

        "content": "David Miller, son of Lennar co-CEO Stuart Miller, was taken into custody on charges related to a domestic violence incident last month at his father\u2019s waterfront Star Island estate.\nDavid Miller, 36, is facing three charges: felony robbery by sudden snatching, felony criminal mischief and a misdemeanor domestic violence battery charge. He entered a plea of not guilty, and his arraignment is scheduled for later this month.\nMiller is a real estate agent with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty, and he previously worked at Lennar. He did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nIt marks at least the second alleged domestic violence episode for Miller. Last year, Miller was\narrested on a felony charge\nof domestic violence battery by strangulation and a misdemeanor charge of domestic violence by another victim.\nThe latest charges were brought by an ex-girlfriend, who told Miami Beach Police officers that after a verbal dispute at Miller\u2019s father\u2019s house at 6\nStar Island\nDrive, Miller wouldn\u2019t let her leave, according to a copy of the incident report, obtained by\nThe Real Deal.\nShe tried to get into the driver\u2019s seat of his car, but he pulled her out and forcefully touched her, ordering her to go inside the guest house. Once inside, Miller pushed her and placed his hand around her neck,\u201d telling her \u201cI thought you liked this,\u201d according to the police report.\nShe repeatedly told him to stop, but Miller continued to touch her and bit her lip and tongue; she \u201cmanaged to get away and began making her way to the main house, looking for Mr. Miller\u2019s dad to no avail,\u201d the report states, noting injuries to her lower lip.\n\nWhen she tried to get an Uber to escape, Miller allegedly grabbed her iPhone and smashed it. A maintenance worker noticed what was happening, which is when Miller ordered her a rideshare from his phone, according to the report. The robbery and mischief charges are related to her phone.\nThat evening she went to the police department in person to report the alleged assault. She also submitted multiple videos from past incidents that depict Miller \u201cin fits of rage\u201d and that backed up the woman\u2019s testimony regarding a history of alleged abusive behavior, according to the police report.\nMiller surrendered and was taken into custody on March 25.\nMiller has been a licensed agent with Coral Gables-based BHHS\nEWM\nRealty since at least 2016. The brokerage \u201cdoes not have any comment\u201d on the charges, according to a spokesperson.\nIn 2020, Miller was the agent on the\n$49.5 million sale\nof his father\u2019s spec mansion at 22 Star Island Drive.\nDavid Miller lives at 350 Meridian Avenue in Miami Beach. His penthouse is on the market for $8.5 million with a Douglas Elliman agent. Property records show he paid about $5.6 million for the 3,000-square-foot, three-bedroom unit in 2015.\nMiller\u2019s grandfather, Leonard Miller, co-founded Lennar with his business partner Arnold Rosen in 1954. Miller is one of\nStuart Miller\n\u2019s four adult children. Stuart Miller, executive chairman and co-CEO of Lennar, is worth about $1.1 billion, according to Forbes.\n",

        "content": "Trinity Flood has been swept up in a deluge of financial distress tied to Chicago real estate.\nThe Wisconsin-based investor that paid $18 million for a trio of South Shore multifamily properties in 2020 is facing a $27 million foreclosure lawsuit for failing to make loan payments on the deal, public records show.\nFlood also purchased three properties in Georgia and one in Arizona with a $25.3 million loan that was later packaged up with other real estate debt and sold off to commercial mortgage-backed securities investors. The landlord is now in danger of losing all 354 units, including 208 in South Shore, in the foreclosure lawsuit.\nIt\u2019s the latest portfolio in South Side neighborhoods to fall into\ndefault on a big loan\nfor a purchase between 2020 and 2022 at prices that signaled rising speculation yet failed to materialize into profits for some investors,\u00a0particularly those who ended up with buildings needing substantial repairs.\nThe loan wasn\u2019t scheduled to mature until 2030, indicating there\u2019s been significant financial difficulty in making interest payments from rent revenues.\nThe seven-property Flood portfolio posted a debt service-coverage ratio of just 0.62 for last year, meaning it\u2019s taking in only 60 percent of the revenue needed to break even after accounting for expenses and debt service costs, according to Morningstar Credit.\nAfter annual revenues of $3.5 million, expenses of $2.5 million and debt service costs of $1.4 million, the apartments portfolio faced an annual shortfall of nearly $470,000 last year, and it appears the landlord has been unwilling to go into pocket to cover the gap, loan servicer data shows.\nFlood has also struggled to pay the utility bills for the Illinois properties, and there was a risk utility service would be shut off without prompt payment as of late December, according to a letter from Bob Stupar, an attorney with Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner, who represents bondholders in the CMBS loan.\n\nTrinity Flood didn\u2019t return a request for comment, and neither did an attorney for K-Star Asset Management, the special servicer overseeing the loan on behalf of bondholders.\nThe landlord has tried to work out a deal to cure the problems with the portfolio, the lawsuit shows. Flood proposed a partial payoff of the loan that would have required a sale of the Illinois properties. It would have allowed the lender to accept a $13.8 million partial paydown of the loan balance through the South Shore sales, and a remaining balance of $10 million for the loan.\nThe lender rejected the proposal, which it said would have been \u201ceffectively writing off $3 million of the loan balance,\u201d adding that it \u201cis not in the lender\u2019s best economic interest.\u201d\nFlood failed to pay the full monthly debt service costs on the portfolio starting in December and has also refused to pay a shortfall for the Arizona property\u2019s real estate taxes, the lawsuit shows. The lender was forced to bring extra money to the deal to avoid a tax delinquency and protect its collateral, it said.\nEarlier in the negotiation process, Flood requested the lender to accept a $22.5 million discounted loan payoff, that would have been achieved by a $13.5 million loan assumption offer for the Chicago properties, in addition to a $9.5 million refinance of the Georgia and Arizona properties.\nBut the lender again rejected the proposal, as the loan balance had exceeded $27 million, plus the lender expressed concern that it hadn\u2019t been aware of any marketing efforts for the Chicago properties, including whether a broker had been hired. It also said it hadn\u2019t received any information regarding the proposed refinancing, such as a term sheet or a loan-to-value ratio for the properties. All that was provided by the borrower was a statement from a debt broker expressing it was ready to help with a loan search.\n\u201cAssuming a refinance lender will not lend 100 percent of the value of the Arizona property and the Georgia properties, there appears to be a significant amount in equity that the borrower is looking to retain for itself through such transaction and, thus, cause a corresponding loss to the lender,\u201d Stupar wrote to Flood in November.\n",

The price comes to $107 per square foot.\nThe balance on the loan was $46.6 million; it was sent to special servicing in 2022.\nThe property was last appraised at $26 million, under $46 per square foot and down 20 percent from its $32.5 million valuation in 2023, according to Morningstar Credit.

The loans, which originated in 2015, totalled $100 million. They\u2019ve been in special servicing since 2021 after the departure of the building\u2019s largest tenant, Waste Management (now WM), in December 2020.\nThe 607,500-square-foot, 32-story building\u2019s taxable value is $25.9 million, less than $43 per square foot, according to the Harris Central Appraisal district.\nAccesso Partners has also faced\nmultiple foreclosures\non Chicago-area office properties.\nHouston\u2019s office market has been struggling under the yoke of older, distressed properties like these. Its vacancy rate rose to 27 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Colliers.\n",

        "content": "A fight over wastewater in Dripping Springs is flushing H-E-B\u2019s expansion plans down the drain.\nA long-running legal fight over treated wastewater disposal is stalling major commercial developments in one of Austin\u2019s fastest-growing suburbs, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nDripping Springs\u2019 population surged over 20 percent last year, and the average home price is nearing $800,000. But the city of 8,700 is rapidly nearing its wastewater treatment capacity, meaning retail projects can\u2019t move forward until the bottleneck clears.\nH-E-B secured approvals earlier this year to demolish its existing Dripping Springs store and build a new one twice the size, but those plans are on hold indefinitely. The San Antonio-based grocery chain won\u2019t move ahead \u201cuntil the city resolves their wastewater challenges,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nThe issue dates back to 2019, when the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality approved the city\u2019s request to expand treatment capacity from 300,000 to 822,500 gallons per day.\nBut environmental groups, led by Save Our Springs Alliance, sued to block the expansion over concerns about treated effluent flowing into Onion Creek. The Texas Supreme Court heard arguments last year, and a ruling is expected this summer.\n\nThe lawsuit led city officials to establish a moratorium on development, lasting almost a year, from November 2021 to September 2022. Dripping Springs has now stopped accepting new wastewater service applications, Deputy City Administrator Ginger Faught told the outlet.\nBuilders have resorted to short-term workarounds, like temporary land application permits and piggybacking on adjacent properties\u2019 unused capacity. Those options are more feasible for housing \u2014 over 5,000 new homes are underway \u2014 but not for retail, which usually lacks the land needed for its own disposal infrastructure.\nThe region has a trade area of 100,000 people, but projects are on pause because Dripping Springs can\u2019t compete with nearby towns offering simpler permitting, said Aaron Farmer, Dripping Springs resident and president of market research firm the Retail Coach. Target and other major retailers are interested but hesitant, he said.\nCity officials say they\u2019re ready to move on expansion the moment the court allows it.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

Six of those agreements were signed between August and March, a period marked by a leadership shakeup featuring the departure of former CEO Tracey Scott.\nOne recipient, longtime COO Eric Garrett, received about $87,000 in severance despite receiving a written warning for violating CHA ethics rules and allegedly failing to take action against an employee who cost the agency $19,000.\nAnother, former general counsel Ellen Harris, received more than $63,000. Harris resigned last August. Records later revealed she was the subject of\nrepeated employee complaints over a \u201ctoxic\u201d workplace culture\n, including allegations of public berating, inflexible schedules and retaliation. Multiple vacancies went unfilled under her tenure.\nBoth Garrett and Harris had been formally reprimanded by Scott before their exits. Scott herself received nearly $129,000 upon her departure in November. She was the only one of the nine whose agreement was pre-negotiated in her employment contract.\nThe agency defended the agreements as standard legal tools used across the public and private sectors, but Alderman Matt Martin, who chairs the City Council\u2019s ethics committee, called the payouts \u201cconcerning.\u201d He questioned the financial logic of paying employees tens of thousands of dollars to leave, particularly those with performance concerns.\n\nThe number and scale of payouts suggests a deeper internal problem at the CHA, Ralph Martire of the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability said.\nMartire acknowledged that separation payments are increasingly common due to political pressures and job difficulty, but emphasized that payouts tied to poor conduct or negligence should be closely scrutinized.\nThe agency maintained that the severance agreements were paid from its personnel budget and did not affect services for residents. It said it\u2019s undergoing \u201ca period of renewal\u201d to improve accountability and efficiency.\nIn addition to its workplace struggles, the CHA is entangled in a lawsuit brought by former property manager The Habitat Company, which claims the agency botched its legal defense in a\nlead poisoning case\nthat cost the agency $24 million. The firm is now\nseeking damages\nfor breach of contract and malpractice.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "With retail roaring in Dallas suburbs, some local family investors are cashing out.\nThe financial services giant Fidelity has acquired Independence Square, a 140,000-square-foot grocery-anchored shopping center at 3100 Independence Parkway in Plano, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nFinancial terms of the deal, which closed last month, were not disclosed.\nThe 13-acre property was sold by an entity led by Head Capital Partners\u2019 Scott Head and co-owned by Sterling Family Partners, records show. It was marketed by JLL Capital Markets\u2019 Chris Gerard, Erin Lazarus, Barry Brown and Adam Howells.\nIndependence Square is 93 percent leased and anchored by a Tom Thumb grocery store that\u2019s operated at the site for more than 40 years. The center was built in 1977 and renovated in 2005. It has an average lease term of just over four years.\nFidelity has become a significant real estate investor in recent years. It reported revenue of $32.7 billion last year and laid off 700 workers a year ago.\n\nDallas-Fort Worth\u2019s retail real estate market is among the strongest in the country.\nRetail occupancy in the metro reached 95.1 percent at the end of last year, near an all-time high, and the market has stayed above 90 percent for the past 11 years, according to Weitzman. With nearly 200 million square feet, it is the largest retail market in Texas.\nRetail construction is expected to ramp up this year, driven by a wave of grocery-anchored centers and mixed-use projects. Delivery volume is projected to reach 2.7 million square feet, the most in seven years, with major players like H-E-B, Walmart and Costco leading the way.\nPlano in particular has benefited from the metro\u2019s population boom. Dallas-Fort Worth added nearly 178,000 new residents between July 2023 and July 2024, ranking third nationwide, per Census data. That\u2019s roughly 487 people per day, a trend that continues to drive investor interest in stable, well-leased retail centers.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

Buyers signed 16 contracts between March 31 and April 6. The properties spent about 131 days on the market, on average.\nForty-one luxury listings were added to the market, for a total of 1,351 listings.\nThe asking dollar volume for the eight single-family homes and eight condos under contract last week totals $208.3 million, according to the report, which is authored by the Douglas Elliman team led by Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes.\nAt the top of the report is the contract inked for 88 La Gorce Circle in Miami Beach. The nine-bedroom, 12-bathroom and three-half-bathroom estate spans 21,659 square feet on over an acre. The house was built in 2008. Nelson Gonzalez of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices EWM Realty has the listing. Ryan Mendell of Maxwelle Real Estate Group is representing the buyer.\nThe\nLa Gorce\nproperty includes a \u201cGuggenheim-inspired\u201d staircase with a skylight, two docks, a 100-foot pool, a guest house, a five-car garage and staff quarters, according to the listing. Records show the Kollmann family\u2019s Okto owns the property. Mendell wrote that the buyer is working with designers and architects to make the property \u201ceven more spectacular than it already is.\u201d Gonzalez and Mendell declined to name the buyer.\n\nThe single-family homes that entered into contract last week had an average asking price of $16.4 million and spent an average of 142 days on the market. They totaled $131.4 million in asking dollar volume.\nThe condos that secured buyers last week had an average asking price of $9.6 million and spent 121 days on the market, on average. They totaled $76.9 million in asking dollar volume, or $2,649 per square foot.\nA unit at Palazzo Del Sol on Fisher Island, asking $18 million, marked the priciest condo to secure a buyer last week. The nearly 4,700-square-foot, four-bedroom and four-and-a-half-bathroom condo is owned by hedge fund manager\nHal Mintz\nand his wife, Allison Mintz, records show. Unit 7012 at 7012 Fisher Island Drive is on the market with Dora Puig of Luxe Living Realty. Fredrik Eklund of Elliman\u2019s Eklund-Gomes Team is representing the buyer.\nThe\nprevious week\n, buyers signed contracts for 28 properties in Miami-Dade, asking a combined $228.3 million.\nLast week in New York, buyers signed contracts for 27 homes, according to the latest\nOlshan\nreport. Their combined asking price was $188.4 million, and the typical home spent 997 days on the market.\n",

        "content": "The receiver for an embattled West Palm Beach firm accused of a massive real estate and securities fraud plans to sell six of its residential properties and several office condos in South Florida.\nMarried couple Janalie Bingham and Jean Joseph, as well as Wells Real Estate Investment, which Bingham led as CEO, allegedly siphoned off more than\n$40 million\nthey raised from 660 investors nationwide, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s lawsuit against the couple and Wells Real Estate, filed in August. From 2020 to last year, Bingham and Joseph lured people to invest $56 million by overstating the size of Wells\u2019 real estate portfolio and promising high returns, the SEC\u2019s complaint alleges.\nBingham and Joseph purchased some properties, but diverted the majority of funds, or about $28 million, to speculative options and futures trading, losing at least $11.9 million, the suit says. The couple also used at least $1.8 million for personal expenses, including luxury cars, and $6.9 million for commissions to sales agents. The scheme also had a Ponzi-like aspect when $10 million of investors\u2019 funds were used to pay interest due to other investors and note redemptions, according to the complaint.\nFederal Judge Donald Middlebrooks issued judgments in December barring Bingham and Joseph from violating the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as well as banning them from serving as directors and officers of an entity that sells securities. Middlebrooks also had issued a judgment against Wells Real Estate in October.\nNow, Andr\u00e9s Rivero, an attorney and court-appointed receiver overseeing Wells Real Estate\u2019s assets, plans to sell some of the firm\u2019s real estate. The properties are owned by entities tied to Wells Real Estate.\nBeyond the alleged fraud scheme, some of its real estate portfolio had fallen into financial hardship with lenders filing foreclosures, according to court filings. Rivero stayed the foreclosure suits. On at least one property, Wells Real Estate also was delinquent on payments to the condominium association, Rivero said in court filings.\nProperties slated for sale include a 1,400-square-foot, two-bedroom condo at the Landings South building at 60 Yacht Club Drive in\nNorth Palm Beach\n, as well as a 2,600-square-foot, three-bedroom oceanfront condo at 3968 North Ocean Drive on\nSinger Island\nin\nRiviera Beach\n, according to Rivero\u2019s court filings and property records.\n\nThe single-family homes Rivero plans to sell are: a 4,100-square-foot, five-bedroom house at 910 Parkside Circle North in\nBoca Raton\n; a 1,500-square-foot, three-bedroom house at 6574 Northwest Fourth Street in Margate; and a 3,300-square-foot, four-bedroom house at 100 Southwest 15th Court in Boca Raton, according to the receiver\u2019s filings and property records. Also slated for sale is Bingham\u2019s 7,000-square-foot, five-bedroom home at 930 North Parkside Circle in Boca Raton.\nMiddlebrooks has approved Rivero\u2019s motion to hire Keyes Company to sell the properties.\nSix vacant office condos at the Executive Court complex at 2295 Northwest Corporate Boulevard in Boca Raton already have a buyer lined up. Steven Levin made an offer to the receiver to purchase the properties for $1.6 million, which Middlebrooks approved. Wells Real Estate, which owns the units through an affiliate, allegedly defaulted on a $750,000 loan on the units in 2023. The lender had filed a foreclosure suit. Wells Real Estate also owed $64,677 in dues to the office condo association, according to the receiver\u2019s court filings.\nRivero worked out a settlement with the lender to pay back the balance on the loan and waive the 11.9 percent default interest and other late fees. Also, the debt to the condo association will be settled for $52,487, according to Rivero\u2019s filings.\nRivero, Bingham and an attorney listed for Joseph didn\u2019t return requests for comment.\nJoseph\u2019s legal woes extend beyond Wells Real Estate. In 2019, he pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud for misappropriating $3 million while operating his company, Evergreen United Investments. Joseph was ordered to pay this amount as restitution and was sentenced to 15 months in prison in 2019. He was placed on supervised release in 2021, according to the SEC\u2019s lawsuit.\n",

        "content": "Owners of a Tucson development firm face two investor lawsuits after they were accused by an arbitrator of ripping off investors.\nThe investors sued the owners of the Gadsden Company following an August ruling by an arbitrator who said the Tucson-based firm had \u201ccommitted acts constituting bad faith, fraud, willful misconduct and intentional misappropriation of funds,\u201d\nAZCentral reported.\nThe lawsuits filed by two investment firms in Pima County Superior Court accused Gadsden founders Adam Weinstein and Gerald Dixon, and the companies they control, of fraud.\nWeinstein and Dixon and their spouses failed to contribute the agreed-upon assets to two different apartment developments in Tucson, while still retaining majority control of the businesses, according to the complaints.\nGadsden Company maintains it never defrauded anyone.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe there was any fraud committed,\u201d Dennis Wilenchik, an attorney who represents Gadsden, told AZCentral. He said the ruling by arbitrator Richard Mahrle was flawed, but there\u2019s no way to appeal it.\nThe arbitration and subsequent lawsuits focus on investor Allen Sands\u2019 battle with the developers of the Mercado District, a shopping and restaurant hub in a historic neighborhood west of Downtown Tucson, 115 miles east of Phoenix.\nGadsden\u2019s projects include the popular\nMSA Annex\n, the Mercado San Agustin and\nBautista\n, a $110 million mixed-use development now under construction. Weinstein, Dixon and their spouses also control Monier Investors Member, a limited liability company that runs the Monier Apartments, a market-rate apartment building in the Mercado District.\nSands manages a pair of investment companies that did business with Weinstein and Dixon: AWS Opportunity Funds I, which funded a Gadsden project; and IB New Ventures, which partnered with Monier.\nLast summer, Mahrle awarded Sands\u2019 AWS Opportunity Funds I more than $3.4 million, plus pre- and post-judgment interest and $1 million in punitive damages. He found Gadsden committed fraud, intentional misconduct, and intentionally misappropriated funds.\n\nThe case centers on a 59-unit apartment complex known as Menlo Park Towers, slated to be built at 115 South Linda Avenue in Tucson. In 2021, Weinstein and Dixon proposed AWS and Gadsden form a third company, Block F Investors, for the project.\nIn February 2022, AWS wired $3.37 million to Block F\n,\nwhich Gadsden managed. Gadsden agreed to contribute land valued at $2.3 million, plus $1.06 million in cash, according to AZCentral.\nBut Mahrle found Gadsden never made that cash contribution and used AWS money to pay for the land. In the ensuing months, Block F didn\u2019t provide AWS with monthly financial statements or progress reports of the project.\nAfter a May 2023 court order to allow an inspection of financial records, AWS found that within three months of wiring the funds, the money was diverted to other projects or expenses.\nThat left Block F \u201cwith nothing but raw land and no money to develop it,\u201d according to the AWS complaint.\nThose funds were used to pay off a lien on the land for the project, plus cover the salaries of Weinstein and his wife, personal expenses made by Dixon and Weinstein, and Gadsden\u2019s payroll, court records show. Funds were also transferred to Weinstein and other related companies under the \u201cguise\u201d of loans\n,\naccording to the attorney for AWS, cited in the complaint.\nThe court appointed a receiver over Block F in February of last year. In September, the court granted the receiver permission to sell the land to a buyer for around $1.6 million.\nWhile the arbitration case involved Block F and Gadsden, AWS is also suing Weinstein, Dixon and their spouses in Pima County to hold them personally liable for damages.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "A Park Tower condo has hit the market for $7.7 million after its owners invested millions into renovating the unit.\nThe sellers of the 4,000-square-foot unit at 800 North Michigan Avenue are asking $1,925 per square foot, a price that would set a record for the building.\nThe unit has two bedrooms, three bathrooms and spans half of the 60th floor.\nIts owners are Sequel Capital founder Harvey Kinzelberg and his wife, Mary Ann, the Chicago Tribune previously reported. The Kinzelbergs invested $7 million into renovations, which were overseen by local designers Scott Himmel and Darcy Bonner.\nThe Kinzelbergs first put the home up for sale in 2016, asking $12 million at a time when no condo in Chicago had ever sold for anywhere near that price of $3,000 per square foot.\nThey\u2019re trying again, asking 35 percent less as the downtown condo market is off to a strong start this year.\n\u201cI think this seller is aware that what they invested in this unit for themselves is not necessarily what they\u2019re going to get back on the return of the home, but I priced it accordingly,\u201d said listing agent Carrie McCormick of\u00a0 @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate. The unit is also one of few penthouse-level condos that has a balcony and views to the north, east and west.\n\nMcCormick recently sold a\nGold Coast penthouse at 4 East Elm Street for $10.1 million\n, or $1,870 per square foot. That proves the market can tolerate such prices, she said. McCormick represented the sellers in that deal along with Sharon O\u2019Hara and Emily Sachs Wong represented the buyers. All three brokers are with @properties.\nThe Gold Coast sale set the record for the city\u2019s priciest sale this year so far. It was originally listed for $2,000 per square foot, but the price dropped before it sold last month.\nMeanwhile, a penthouse on Park Tower\u2019s 63rd floor is also asking $7.7 million, but offering twice the space for a price per square foot of $917. Jeff Lowe of Compass has that listing, a five-bedroom, six-bathroom penthouse that has been on the market since 2022 with various price cuts along the way.\n\u201cWe are without question the best price for penthouses in that building right now,\u201d Lowe said of his listing. \u201cI just happened to have a very realistic seller, and he wanted to be the best-priced penthouse in the building. And we are, and we can tell that because other people within the building are giving serious consideration to it.\u201d\nThe penthouse directly above Lowe\u2019s listing, on the 64th floor, was listed by McCormick and Frank Lowery (also of @properties) earlier this year at $11.7 million, or $1,376 per square foot and has been renovated.\nOne of the priciest sales at Park Tower in recent years came in January of 2023 when\nStar Wars Creator George Lucas\nand his wife Mellody Hobson\nbought\ntheir 8,000-square-foot unit on the 66th floor of Park Tower for $11.2 million, or $1,400 per square foot. That marked the priciest condo sale of the year in Chicago.\n",

        "content": "Koontz Corporation is pushing ahead with an apartment development in North San Antonio, betting that high-end retail, affluent neighbors and future road upgrades will offset softness in the multifamily market.\nThe local developer plans to build 305 units in a development called the Elle Apartment Homes, slated for a nearly 10-acre site at Loop 1604 and Blanco Springs Road, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nKoontz acquired the land in February from IBC Bank for an undisclosed sum.\u202fConstruction is expected to begin in the third quarter, with completion targeted for June 2027. Garcia + Associates Architect and Casey Roy Design are leading design work for the complex.\nThe market has struggled recently with oversupply and slower lease-ups, but Koontz is banking on future infrastructure improvements and the area\u2019s proximity to major commercial corridors to support demand. The site sits near high-income neighborhoods and retail hubs, like The Rim and Stone Oak.\nIt\u2019s also adjacent to a stretch of Loop 1604 where roughly $300 million in improvements are expected to ease congestion and improve access. That roadwork is slated to wrap around the same time the apartments are delivered.\n\nThe Elle joins several other upscale apartment projects in North San Antonio, where developers have remained relatively active even as high interest rates and rising construction costs have sidelined other projects across the metro. Some active projects include Woodbranch Management\u2019s recently approved plan to\nconvert its office building\ninto apartments near Balcones Heights.\nThis year is shaping up to be a quiet one for apartment deliveries across the region. Apartment starts dropped 80 percent last year in the San Antonio metro area, with only 1,874 units starting construction compared to 9,526 units in 2023, according to MMG Real Estate Advisors. Projects like The Elle reflect longer-term bets that today\u2019s slower pipeline could give way to a more balanced market by the time these units hit.\nKoontz, like other developers, appears to be positioning for a market where delayed supply and continued job and population growth could improve fundamentals over the next few years.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Some last-mile facilities in the city may have reached their\u2026 final mile.\nIn one month, the city will hold a meeting on a proposal that would require developers to obtain special permits in order to build last-mile facilities, the name used for warehouses where packages are sorted and stored before reaching their final destinations.\nThe environmental assessment statement for the proposal, finished March 28, includes some of the city\u2019s rationale for pursuing this change, including the traffic that results from these warehouses and the resulting effect on air quality.\n\u201cThese specialized warehouses play a critical role ensuring New Yorkers receive goods ordered online in a timely and efficient manner, but, as demand for deliveries grows, conflicts between the facilities that manage deliveries and city residents have become more acute,\u201d the document states.\nThe EAS also provides more details on the special permit requirements.\nProjects will not require a special permit if they are smaller than 50,000 square feet, rely on waterways rather than city roads for transportation of goods or are more than 500 feet away from zoning districts where housing is permitted, while also meeting \u201ccertain electric vehicle charging infrastructure standards\u201d to be determined by City Planning.\nThe EAS estimates that if special permits are required, roughly seven facilities larger than 50,000 square feet will be built by 2035. If special permits are not required, that number would reach 10.\nThose are just projections, and the EAS acknowledges that it is impossible to accurately predict how many facilities would be built. Still, the estimates offer a rosier picture than what opponents have predicted, which is that adding a special permit requirement \u2014\u00a0which adds considerable time and money to a project \u2014\u00a0will halt construction of these facilities. Such was\nthe case\nwhen the city started requiring special permits for new hotels.\n\u201cThe industrial sector plays a vital role in the city\u2019s economy and provides thousands of jobs to hard-working New Yorkers,\u201d the Real Estate Board of New York\u2019s Basha Gerhards said in a statement. \u201cThe city cannot afford another significant policy misstep like the citywide hotel special permit, which halted the construction of new hotels.\u201d\nWhile this proposal is being reviewed, it will be interesting to see how the prospect of special permits affects the pricing of existing last-mile facilities. You\u2019d expect the value of these properties to go up, but if tariffs drive e-commerce down, demand for these spaces could take a hit.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: How are you thinking about tariffs and their broader economic implications? In the immediate, how is this affecting you or your projects? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The Hotel Association of New York is spending in the \u201chigh six figures\u201d\u00a0 on ads calling for a reduction to the city\u2019s hotel room occupancy tax. Citing tariffs, inflation and other challenges faced by the hotel industry, the group, with the backing of City Council members Amanda Far\u00edas and Kevin Riley, launched StayNYC. The campaign calls for the occupancy tax to be reduced from nearly 5.9 percent to 3 percent in the city\u2019s budget.\n\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Pro-housing group Open New York\u2019s super PAC, Abundant New York, is spending $500,000 in the City Council races. The group announced its slate of endorsements on Monday, backing newcomers Jess Coleman, Shirley Aldebol, Elsie Encarnaci\u00f3n and Ben Wetzler, as well as incumbent Council members Pierina Sanchez and Shahana Hanif. The group is endorsing another six incumbents in non-competitive races. City &amp; State was the first to\nreport\nAbundant New York\u2019s spending plans.\n\u2014 The Trump administration\u2019s latest round of tariffs could cause the MTA\u2019s construction costs to balloon,\nGothamist reports\n. \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with complex technology, there is a worldwide supply chain,\u201d MTA Chair Janno Lieber said at a news conference. \u201cEven when we build subway cars in New York State \u2026 there are parts that come from all over the world.\u201d\n\u2014 A new report by the Regional Plan Association projects that some 80,000 homes in Staten Island, southeast Queens and the suburbs east of NYC could be lost to flooding in the next 15 years,\nthe New York Times reports\n. The report also estimates that the region\u2019s housing needs could rise to 1.2 million by 2040 due to residences lost from \u201cpermanent, chronic, and coastal flooding.\u201d\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Monday was\n$7.7 million\nfor a condo unit at 50 West 66th Street. The Upper West Side condo is 2,900 square feet.\nThe Corcoran Group\u2019s\nHilary Landis and Beth Benalloul have the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$45 million\nfor an apartment building and surrounding vacant land at 4-34 26th Avenue. The lot area includes more than 28,600 square feet of space.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $70 million for 8 East 62nd Street. The Lenox Hill home is 15,000 square feet and has five stories.\nThe Modlin Group\nhas the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for a 55,252-square-foot, eight-story, mixed-use building at 860 Flushing Avenue in Brooklyn.

The council asked the city attorney, Housing Department and chief legislative analyst to report back on how they can \u201cdisencumber\u201d the cash.\nTo draw funds for wildfire rent relief, the city is looking to skim up to 10 percent from 11 House LA Fund spending categories.\nThe Palisades fire ripped through\n7,000 structures\n, killing 12 people and burned much of the coastal Palisades, leaving thousands of residents without homes.\nThe voter-approved Measure ULA real estate transfer tax, which went into effect on April 1, 2023, now charges a 4 percent fee on all residential and commercial property sales above $5.1 million and a 5.5 percent fee on sales above $10.3 million.\nThe tax, commonly known as the \u201cmansion tax,\u201d is\nexpected to be adjusted in June\n.\n\nAs of March, the nearly two-year-old tax had garnered\n$632.6 million\nfrom 939 transactions, according to the city\u2019s ULA dashboard. About 70 percent of revenue generated by ULA supports affordable housing programs, while 30 percent pays for homelessness prevention initiatives.\nThat\u2019s a far cry from the up to $1.1 billion a year billed to voters as a way to pay for affordable housing and homelessness prevention.\nAfter the mansion tax went into effect, the pace of investment sales in Los Angeles\nslowed by half\n, according to a University of California, Los Angeles\nanalysis\n. The drop in sales volume translates to a $25 million initial annual loss in city property tax revenue.\nMayor Karen Bass\nhinted at\nreforming the two-year-old tax last month, and now lawmakers in Sacramento are tuning in.\nLast week, state Assembly member Buffy Wicks\nintroduced a bill\nrestricting cities from enacting new transfer taxes before studying their potential impact on housing production.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nThe restaurant concept is expected to open this year, but a CBRE spokesperson was unable to specify more precise timing. Round 1 calls its \u201cdining collection\u201d concept Sora, which will consist of eight upscale restaurants selling Japanese and Chinese dishes, according to a marketing video.\nParent company Round One, which is traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, has built a business on arcade and bowling centers.\nSora, once open, will occupy the entire first and second floors of The Now. That leaves the building\u2019s third level available, with a roughly 3,000-square-foot patio and about 5,000 square feet of interior space that could potentially be absorbed by another restaurant tenant or serve as a showroom for a brand, according to Industry Partners\u2019 Aram Pogosian.\nPogosian, along with Elan Kermani of City Street Commercial, represented landlord United El Segundo in the lease.\n\nCBRE\u2019s\nGreg Briest\n,\nHouman Mahboubi\n,\nMarisa Renfro\nand\nKenji Sakai\nrepresented Round 1 Delicious.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a massive addition to the Sunset Strip,\u201d Pogosian said of the lease.\nSora is a big get for the corner of Sunset and La Cienega boulevards. Following the closure of Los Angeles boutique retailer Fred Segal\u2019s 22,000-square foot flagship last year, which is across the street from The Now, the area has landed some big-name tenants.\nMost recently was last week\u2019s opening of a store for Kim Kardashian\u2019s\nSkims\nline, which is about a five-minute walk from The Now. Last August saw the addition of the Keys Nightclub, which is about half a mile away from where Round 1 signed its lease.\nThe Now was completed last May and totals 28,930 square feet across three stories.\n",

        "content": "A major tenant is backtracking on office cuts in the Loop, this time under marching orders from the Trump administration.\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has expanded its office space at 101 North Wacker Drive by more than 25,000 square feet, according to\nCrain\u2019s\n. That brings its lease to about 70,000 square feet, more than it held before a downsizing move last year.\nThe expansion comes less than a year after FINRA\nreduced its Chicago office presence\nto 45,000 square feet when relocating from 55 West Monroe, citing its hybrid work approach.\nThe regulator\u2019s renewed appetite for space is tied to a recent executive order from President Donald Trump requiring all federal agencies and related entities to end remote work and return to in-person operations, sources told the outlet.\nTelos Group\u2019s Jeff Dowdell oversees leasing at the 24-story 101 North Wacker, while CBRE\u2019s Tony Coglianese, Bill Sheehy and Brady Wolfe repped FINRA on the expansion.\nFINRA is a private nonprofit that is overseen by the U.S. Securities &amp; Exchange Commission and enforces rules for Wall Street brokerages. The agency employs over 4,200 people nationwide.\nIts decision to grow its downtown Chicago space bucks the dominant trend across the Loop, where a\nrecord-high vacancy rate\nand widespread downsizing have plagued landlords since the pandemic.\n\nBut Wacker Drive has seen its own mini-revival of tenant interest lately, though largely drawn from the strong pull of updated office spaces. AmTrust RE scored\ntwo new tenants and three renewals\nat its renovated 1 East Wacker Drive, and Beacon Capital Partners a\n27,000-square-foot lease\nfrom food and beverage tech firm JBT Marel, on the 34th floor of the renovated 333 West Wacker Drive.\nThe reversal is a win for LaSalle Investment Management, which owns the 663,900-square-foot tower and now counts FINRA as its largest active tenant.\nThe building is roughly 76 percent leased, about average for downtown properties, but has seen major attrition, including freight firm TTX vacating its headquarters\nin 2023\n.\nLaSalle struck a deal late last year with its lender, Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America, to reduce its $116 million mortgage balance to $90 million. The exact terms remain unclear, but the move likely reflects the building\u2019s diminished value in what\u2019s largely stayed a high-interest, low-demand market.\nThe deal also provides a dose of good news amid broader instability in the federal real estate landscape. The Trump administration has directed agencies to\nslash leases nationwide\nand curb regulation, breeding tension between federal workforce goals and fiscal austerity.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

It would replace a row of single-story storefronts.\nThe project, targeting empty nesters who want to remain in San Mateo, is among several projects adding thousands of homes since last fall, when voters approved taller, denser housing in downtown and along El Camino.\nPlans call for a 14-story luxury apartment tower, with hotel-style draws such as an indoor movie room, golf simulator, spa and gym.\nThe gray and white project, designed by Arc Tec, would include 80 studio, 136 one- and 20 two-bedroom apartments, atop 108,000 feet of ground-floor high-end shops, restaurants and offices. The building would have inset and corner balconies, with its top floors sheathed in floor-to ceiling windows, a rendering indicates.\nMecah would employ a state density bonus to construct a larger building than zoning rules allow in exchange for 36 affordable apartments for low- to middle-income households.\nApartments at the building dubbed \u201c4th and El Camino\u201d would lease for between $3,000 to $5,000 a month. With homes in San Mateo costing between $1.6 million and $4 million, monthly property taxes can run up to $3,700, according to Zillow.\n\n\u201cYou could probably rent one of our units for less than the property taxes on a home you just sold,\u201d Mike Field, founder of Mecah Ventures, told the Business Times.\nIt would be among the rare luxury offerings in downtown.\nField, who has several San Mateo projects in the works, expects more by developers after Measure T passed with 59 percent voter approval last fall. It allows taller residential buildings near Caltrain stations, El Camino and Highway 101.\n\u201cFor a long time, density was bad,\u201d Field told the newspaper. \u201cThat pushed out people more likely to use transit, downtown restaurants and amenities. And these downtowns started to die.\u201d\nZachary Dahl, the city\u2019s community development director, said eight new proposals totaling about 3,000 homes have been submitted since an updated general plan took effect late last year.\n\u201cThe passage of Measure T opened the doors for new housing in San Mateo,\u201d Dahl told the Business Times.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "The fate of the Brooklyn Marine Terminal is still up in the air.\nThe New York City Economic Development Corporation postponed a critical vote on a $3.1 billion plan to transform the 122-acre swath of Brooklyn waterfront, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The decision followed requests from the project\u2019s 28-member task force for additional time to review the proposal.\nThe vote, originally scheduled for Apr. 11, concerned the preliminary blueprint for redeveloping the Brooklyn Marine Terminal, which stretches from Pier 7 in Cobble Hill to Pier 12 in Red Hook. This marks the second delay after an earlier postponement in March.\n\u201cCertain fundamental elements of the site plan have still not been properly presented or explained to us,\u201d State Senator Andrew Gounardes, co-vice chair of the task force, said in a statement to the publication. He emphasized key issues, including \u201ctransportation flow, housing options, resiliency, and site governance,\u201d that require clarification.\nThe ambitious redevelopment envisioned by the city includes 60 acres dedicated to modern port infrastructure, approximately 8,000 apartments \u2014 including 2,000 lower-income units \u2014 30 acres of public space, 300,000 square feet of commercial space, enhanced flood protections and expanded transportation options. EDC estimates the project could generate $12 billion in regional economic impact.\n\nThe postponement will likely extend the vote by two to three weeks, according to EDC president Andrew Kimball, though some task force members are advocating for a longer extension, possibly into June.\nThe project stems from\na deal\nnegotiated by the Eric Adams administration in which the city traded Staten Island\u2019s Howland Hook Marine Terminal for the Brooklyn facility. Unlike typical developments requiring City Council approval, this project has a streamlined state review process.\nFunding concerns remain significant: port modernization alone will cost an estimated $1.75 billion. The city has secured a $164 million federal grant and $95 million in city and state commitments for initial upgrades, though fears persist that the Trump administration could try to claw back the federal money.\nThe task force vote will initiate a year-long environmental review before a detailed proposal advances to the state for final approval.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Palm Beach buyers have always come from the Northeast \u2014 affluent families journey from New York, Connecticut and New Jersey to the island for tropical refuge. Now, agents say a new crowd is coming to town: the Californians.\n\u201cOver the last 12 months I\u2019ve seen more buyers from California than I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Palm Beach County agent Nick Malinosky of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Exclusive Group, a team he founded with Gary Pohrer and Devin Kay. He\u2019s been selling homes in the area for 20 years.\n\u201cThe first 15 [years] I had never worked with a buyer from California,\u201d he said.\nThat started to change during the pandemic. Perhaps the most well-known Californian relocation was billionaire Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, who spent a record\n$173 million\non a 16-acre Manalapan estate in 2022. Harvey Jones, a longtime Nvidia board member and newly minted billionaire, bought and homesteaded a waterfront Palm Beach estate for\n$74.3 million\nlast year.\nReading the tea leaves, the Hilton family, famed Beverly Hills residents,\nexpanded their namesake residential brokerage to Palm Beach\n. Barron and Tessa Hilton have settled on the island as they set up shop. Sylvester Stallone, another longtime Los Angeles resident, bought a waterfront Palm Beach home for\n$35.4 million\nin 2020, and announced last year he was relocating full time, according to published reports.\nBrokers say this coast-to-coast transplanting trend is escalating. Agents credit the sudden influx to a few factors: fires, politics, taxes and business.\nBrokers say they\u2019ve gotten calls from people affected by the Palisades and Altadena fires that devastated Los Angeles earlier this year, often looking for rentals where they can rebuild their lives. Fire victims don\u2019t represent the majority of Californians coming to Palm Beach County, though.\nPolitics is also playing a role, agents say. Palm Beach County is obviously the epicenter of President Trump\u2019s political movement, as the home of his\nMar-a-Lago Club\nwhere much of his politicking and dealmaking unfold. While it looms large in the public mind as a Republican stomping ground, the county itself is quite purple. Kamala Harris won the county with 49.9 percent of the vote, and Trump took 49.2 percent.\n\u201cThey\u2019re pretty much centrists, most of them,\u201d Pohrer said of the Californian clients he is working with. \u201cThere were just some political things where they didn\u2019t feel like they could express their freedoms.\u201d\nFinancial drivers\nFor many of the California buyers coming to Palm Beach County, the move has more to do with dollars and cents. Florida\u2019s tax code is much more wallet-friendly than California\u2019s, with no state income taxes, and it is considered one of the most business-friendly states in the nation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to ramp up here,\u201d said Kelly Smallridge, president and CEO of the Business Development Board of Palm Beach County. \u201cThe business circles are so open because no one is from here. I have literally seen people come here from other states and become mayor in four years.\u201d\nDana Koch, an agent with the Corcoran Group in Palm Beach, said he has a California client relocating his business to West Palm Beach. It\u2019s taken Californians a while to catch wind of Palm Beach County, according to Koch. \u201cMost of them have heard of Palm Beach, but they have no idea what it is,\u201d he said.\nCalifornians weren\u2019t really interested in alternative living situations until the more recent pileup of challenges facing the state: in addition to the fires, housing and cost-of-living crises.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really hard to compete with California in the past,\u201d Smallridge said. \u201cCalifornians really love their lifestyle.\u201d\nBut so do Palm Beachers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably one of the best lifestyles in the country,\u201d said Margit Brandt, an agent with Premier Estate Properties. She said the region\u2019s real estate boom, coupled with the presidential spotlight, have helped to elevate the area\u2019s profile in wealthy circles around the country.\nThe slew of tech billionaires who pilgrimaged to Mar-a-Lago during the presidential transition put Palm Beach on Silicon Valley\u2019s radar. Senada Ad\u017eem, a Boca Raton-based agent with Douglas Elliman, said she\u2019s seen an uptick in West Coast clients moving their tech businesses to Palm Beach County.\n\u201cThe redevelopment of West Palm Beach is playing into this,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s really good office spaces they can find.\u201d\nThat\u2019s thanks to\nbillionaire developer Steve Ross\n, who is building millions of square feet of office space for \u201cWall Street South.\u201d He has already completed the 20-story\n360 Rosemary\nbuilding and the 25-story\nOne Flagler\noffice tower. He is also planning\n10 CityPlace and 15 CityPlace\n, each spanning 430,000 square feet.\nSmallridge and the Business Development Board of Palm Beach County are ramping up efforts to woo Silicon Valley. She advocated for\nVanderbilt University\u2019s\nproposal for\na $520 million tech- and business-focused graduate campus\nin West Palm Beach, which won approval in October.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done it before with Wall Street South, we can do it again,\u201d she said. Plus, \u201cThey also believe the real estate is a lot cheaper.\u201d",

        "content": "NewYork-Presbyterian secured fresh financing for its multipurpose tower on the Upper East Side.\nThe Dormitory Authority of the State of New York provided $186.1 million to the hospital system to refinance the Helmsley Medical Tower at 505 East 70th Street, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. Spokespeople for both the hospital and the lender declined to comment to the observer.\nThe refinancing was first reported by\nPincusCo\n.\nThe financing replaces a $171.4 million loan on the property, which is also addressed at 1320 York Avenue. DASNY was also the lender on that deal.\nThe hospital requested the financing from DASNY in January as it sought to refund multifamily revenue housing bonds from the New York City Housing Development Corporation. Those bonds were the initial financing mechanism for the 36-story, 517-unit property. The building includes medical clinics, hotel rooms and staff housing, ranging from studio apartments to three-bedroom units.\n\nThe hospital system recently signed a lease for 10,000 square feet at Simone Development Companies\u2019 2510 Westchester Avenue in the Bronx, where it will operate a primary care facility.\nThree years ago, NewYork-Presbyterian\nsigned a 20-year lease\nfor an Och Spine outpatient care facility at Tishman Speyer\u2019s The Spiral in Hudson Yards. The facility occupies 75,000 square feet on the second floor of the building, 66 Hudson Boulevard, and includes on-site radiology and spine treatment, procedure rooms, a physical therapy gym and a collaborative space for physicians.\nElsewhere in the neighborhood, the City Planning Commission certified Northwell Health\u2019s application for a 1.4 million-square-foot medical complex in February, launching the\nseven-month review process\nto rezone the site.\nThe planned renovation includes two new buildings and additions to the existing hospital for 475 single-bed rooms, 30 operating suites and a larger emergency department, according to plans filed with the city.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Los Angeles Rams owner Stan Kroenke envisions a $10 billion redevelopment of Warner Center in Woodland Hills.\nIn the next few weeks, the billionaire developer intends to file plans for the 100-acre NFL team headquarters, residential and retail entertainment hub,\nthe Los Angeles Times reported\n.\nThe project, designed by San Francisco-based Gensler, aims to turn an underused corner of the San Fernando Valley into an urban\u00a0 centerpiece of Los Angeles.\nThe development, which could break ground as early as 2027, is expected to take a decade to complete.\nKroenke, who built the $5 billion SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, wants to build a permanent home for the Rams surrounded by high-end apartments, offices, shopping, restaurants, parks and entertainment venues.\nTwo indoor concert halls \u2014 one with 5,000 seats and the other with 2,500 seats \u2014 would complement the Rams facility, which would include an indoor practice field, permanent offices and upgraded training grounds for the team.\n\u201cThis project provides a way to bring more live entertainment to the Valley without people needing to drive across the city,\u201d Rams President Kevin Demoff told the Times.\nThe L-shaped site is divided into three parcels. Topanga Village, an open-air shopping center to the north, would remain as is. A temporary Rams training facility on the eastern portion would become permanent, and serve as home to its future headquarters at a \u201creskinned\u201d 13-story office tower once occupied by Anthem Blue Cross.\n\nThe western parcel, formerly home to the defunct Promenade mall, would be redeveloped into a mixed-use village of homes, dining, grocery and specialty food stores and a 1.5-acre park.\nCouncil member Bob Blumenfield, who represents the area, called the plan \u201can anchor\u201d for revitalizing the West Valley, praising Kroenke for investing in a site dormant for over a decade.\nThe project replaces earlier redevelopment plans by mall developer Westfield and reflects updated goals for post-pandemic lifestyles, including a shift toward smaller venues and open-air amenities. With more residents working from home and shopping online, Kroenke\u2019s vision emphasizes community engagement, liveability and the Rams brand.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a facility,\u201d architect Eric Stultz of Gensler told the Times. \u201cIt\u2019s a consistent, humming environment \u2014 not just big crowds or empty lots.\u201d\nThe move also gives the Rams an identity separate from the Chargers, with whom they share SoFi Stadium, further expanding their presence in the L.A. market.\n\u201cWe built an identity in the Valley,\u201d Kroenke declared. \u201cNow, we\u2019re giving it a heart.\u201d\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

The Chetrits had to chip in new equity to close the deal.\nWill Forbes of\nIron Hound Management\nbrokered the deal.\nThe two five-story office and retail buildings struggled with vacancies. When the loan was originated in 2014, both buildings were fully leased. But the property at 427 Broadway lost a key tenant when American Apparel filed for bankruptcy in 2017 and closed its 13,000-square-foot store.\nThe buildings reached full occupancy in 2019. But the pandemic reduced occupancy to 33 percent, according to MorningStar. The loan\u2019s debt service coverage ratio slipped to below 1, meaning revenue could not meet its monthly debt payments.\nChetrit was able to bring in new tenants \u2014 by late 2023, occupancy rose to 100 percent. But a year later, the properties landed back in\nspecial servicing\n.\n\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities have to go through the special servicing process in order to be worked out. This process can take years. In the case with the Soho properties, Chetrit had to chip in new equity.\n\u201cThe Chetrit Organization is grateful for [Rialto\u2019s] creativeness and willingness to work with us to come to an amicable resolution,\u201d said Michael Chetrit in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to closing a few more restructurings in the coming week.\u201d\nChetrit Organization was led by the late Jacob Chetrit and his brother Juda, but it appears that Jacob\u2019s son Michael Chetrit is now the point person for the firm since Jacob died in January.\nChetrit Organization often partners with the better-known Chetrit Group, led by Joseph and Meyer Chetrit. Chetrit Organization has faced a few notable foreclosures, including its 366,000-square-foot FiDI office tower at\n1 Whitehall\n.\nBut Michael Chetrit\u2019s comments suggest the borrower could be resolving some of these problem loans in the near future.\nRialto\nacquired a chunk of the former Signature Bank\u2019s loan portfolio in 2023. Since then, it has not shied away from launching foreclosures against borrowers, which has angered many borrowers who thought they signed on for loans with the customer-friendly\nSignature Bank\n.\nRialto has claimed it only enforces its rights and remedies in \u201crare instances.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Two foreclosures in three months have Dallas real estate insiders asking: What\u2019s going on at Harwood International?\nThere appears to be something amiss in the portfolio of the Dallas developer with the namesake district in the region\u2019s hottest office submarket.\nHarwood just avoided losing Saint Ann Court (Harwood No. 6) to foreclosure in January with a midnight-hour recapitalization deal.\nIt wasn\u2019t so lucky with Harwood No. 4; it lost the 221,000-square-foot property on the Dallas County Courthouse steps April 1 to Spear Street Capital, which took back the building in a $73 million credit bid, deed records show. That\u2019s $330 per square foot. Spear Street Capital bought the mortgage from Affinius Capital Management in late March.\nThe distress may not end with those two properties.\nHarwood No. 1, which was built in 1984, is just 54.1 percent leased. Though it\u2019s currently 80 percent leased, the 1999-built Harwood No. 3 will take a major hit when law firm Jones Day moves to Harwood\u2019s upcoming project, Harwood No. 15, which is set to be\ndelivered\nin June 2027.\nFor Harwood Nos. 1, 3 and 4, the company may be content to let the poorly performing buildings go back to the bank rather than spending to update them. Harwood No. 1 was built in 1984. Nos. 3 and 4 were built in 1999 and 2000, respectively.\n\nLetting a building go back to the bank doesn\u2019t ruin a firm\u2019s reputation with lenders the way it used to, Partners\u2019 Steve Triolet said.\n\u201cIn the past, you\u2019d be blacklisted,\u201d he said. \u201cIt appears that in more recent years, the market is more forgiving.\u201d\nThat doesn\u2019t explain what happened with Saint Ann Court, which is 89.2 percent leased. It makes sense that Harwood would take pains to keep it, since it renovated the property in 2020.\nHarwood did not respond to requests for comment.\nUptown was the Metroplex submarket with the lowest office vacancy rate (8.5 percent) in the first quarter, according to Savills. Meanwhile, it\u2019s fetching the highest rental rates at an average of $60.49 per square foot.\nIt\u2019s a popular destination for companies in search of amenity-rich offices, like Lockton Companies. The insurance brokerage became the latest major employer to ditch downtown for Uptown when it\nleased 100,000 square feet\nat Victory Commons One, a 15-story office tower at 2601 Victory Avenue developed by Ross Perot Jr.\u2019s Hillwood Urban in 2022.\nUptown is also becoming the de facto headquarters of \u201cY\u2019all Street.\u201d The neighborhood will be on the receiving end of more than $1 billion in investment over the next few years, with the development of NorthEnd, a Hunt Realty project that will include a $500 million campus for Goldman Sachs, and Parkside Uptown, a Pacific Elm building that will house Bank of America.\n",

The sale breaks down to $2,563 per square foot.\nThe two-story, 4,000-square-foot building has been the home to a Prada store for a couple of years. Benchmark leased the property to Prada shortly after purchasing the property in January 2022 for $6.1 million.\nTahari Realty\u2019s Jordan Sutton and Mark Golberg arranged the deal; Sutton said the property on the well-trafficked corner \u201cgenerated interest relatively quickly.\u201d\nThe property was built nearly a century ago, but renovated in 2012. There are roughly 2,000 square feet on each floor of the building.\n\nThe building is across the street from 1 Main Street, which is home to the most prominent Hamptons retail sale in recent memory.\nLVMH CEO Bernard Arnault in 2023\npaid $22 million\nfor the property. The Taharis \u2014 who relaunched their brokerage arm, timing it to the Newtown Lane sale \u2014 were the sellers of 1 Main Street. Jordan Sutton, then with Cushman &amp; Wakefield, also assisted in that deal.\nIt\u2019s unclear if the change in ownership at 2 Newtown Lane will affect Prada\u2019s future in East Hampton, but the luxury retailer has been making real estate moves all its own recently. The company last year bought a retail condo in Midtown Manhattan at 730 Fifth Avenue, the Crown Building, for\n$12.6 million\nfrom Brookfield Properties.\nThat came four months after Prada\ninked deals\nto buy its flagship store at 724 Fifth Avenue and neighboring 720 Fifth Avenue for a total of $835 million from Jeff Sutton\u2019s Wharton Properties, though the retail condo may have been part of those original transactions.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

A few months ago, the real estate investment trust\nwrote its investment to zero\n, suggesting its worth had dropped below the value of the debt. Newmark holds the listing for the KPMG Building, built in 2002.\nThe $187.5 million loan matures in October 2026, when tenants are poised to vacate 170,000 square feet of offices, leaving the Financial District building more than half empty.\nIn November 2026, consulting firm KPMG will clear out of\n140,000-square-foot offices\nin the building in a move to\n505 Howard Street\n. Rippling will also jump ship from 30,000 square feet of offices to a\nnew hub at 430 California Street\n.\nThe exits could nuke a Paramount effort to refinance any maturing debt backed by the building, according to the Business Times.\nIn 2019, Paramount bought a\n44.1 percent stake in the building\nin a deal that valued the offices at $408 million, or $1,054 per square foot. Its joint venture partner was not identified.\nParamount also bought two other office buildings in San Francisco in the year prior to the pandemic.\n\nIt acquired a 293,000-square-foot structure at 111 Sutter Street for $227 million, or $775 per square foot, followed by the 745,000-square-foot Market Center complex at 555 and 575 Market Street for $722 million, or $969 per square foot.\nParamount wrote both investments to zero in 2023 and 2022, respectively, then told investors early last year neither property would likely remain in its portfolio,\naccording to the Business Times.\nIn January, locally based Flynn Properties bought the troubled\n$416.5 million loan\ndebt backed by Market Center. The sale of the $416.5 million loan allowed Flynn to take control of the former Chevron headquarters for around $230 per square foot, or\n$171.4 million\n.\nEarly this week, Paramount\u2019s stock was trading under $4 per share, down 20 percent year to date.\nIn recent regulatory filings, the REIT revealed it had shuttled millions in undisclosed payments to outside companies owned by its CEO, Albert Behler, and his spouse, putting it in the crosshairs of regulators and investors. It also\npaid Behler at least $4 million\nfor personal expenses and business interests.\nParamount, which owns 14 million square feet of offices in New York and San Francisco, has been under fire from shareholders.\nTop Paramount executives earn disproportionately high pay packages related to returns and relative to other companies, according to a recent Green Street report, which called Paramount \u201cone of the worst performing office REITs over many time periods.\u201d\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

More than 800 employees at City National Bank, led by CEO Jorge Gonzalez, will move into the new space next year.\nThe building, completed in 2009, was the former headquarters for Bacardi USA. It will be renamed City National Financial Center.\nEric Groffman was part of the CBRE team that represented the landlord. Matthew Goodman was part of the CBRE team that represented the tenant.\nThe lease comes as City National Bank, with $27 billion in assets and roughly 1,000 employees, plans to expand its workforce by 20 percent in the next year and a half, according to the release.\nStaff members now working at offices in downtown Miami, Brickell and Coral Gables will move to the new headquarters.\nCity National\u2019s current headquarters is at the Miami Tower at 100 Southeast Second Street in downtown Miami. In 2018, the bank made the tower its headquarters, expanding its lease to a\n105,000-square-foot space\n. Its previous headquarters was at\n25 West Flagler Street\n, also in downtown Miami.\n\nMost of City National\u2019s executives work at the current Coral Gables office in the four-story, 124,200-square-foot building at 2855 South Le Jeune Road. The bank owns the building, records show.\nCity National also leases at 1450 Brickell Avenue in Miami.\nIt\u2019s unclear what the bank\u2019s plans are for its existing leases and Coral Gables building following the consolidation. The new Coral Gables headquarters will house divisions for private, small business and international banking, wealth management and other business lines, as well as human resources, finance and information technology staff members.\nCity National Bank traces its roots to 1926 when entrepreneur Baron de Hirsch Meyer and accountant Leonard Abess partnered on making small business loans, the bank\u2019s website says. The bank\u2019s precursor, North Shore Bank, was established in 1946 in North Miami Beach.\nThe lease comes amid a slowdown in the influx of out-of-state companies, which was all the rage in South Florida\u2019s\noffice market\nfrom late 2020 through 2022. Much of the current demand is from longtime tenants in the tri-county region, while any new-to-market demand has been for smaller spaces, experts have told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nGemini, a New York-based cryptocurrency exchange platform, will open its first South Florida office in an\n8,800-square-foot space\nat the 545Wyn building at 545 Northwest 26th Street in Miami\u2019s Wynwood.\nAmazon, which already had a Miami presence, leased\n50,300 square feet\nat the Wynwood Plaza mixed-use project at 95 Northwest 29th Street in Miami. Oak Row Equities, L&amp;L Holding, Shorenstein and Marcelo Claure\u2019s Claure Group are developing Wynwood Plaza.\nAmong longtime South Florida tenants leasing offices is brokerage Transwestern, which moved to a\n4,500-square-foot space\nat The Alhambra at 2 Alhambra Plaza in Coral Gables from Miami Tower. Next year, telecommunications firm Verizon will move to a\n51,500-square-foot space\nat 5200 Waterford District Drive in the Waterford Business District from 9700 Northwest 112th Avenue in unincorporated Miami-Dade County.\n",

        "content": "An environmental justice push from Chicago\u2019s mayor is raising alarms in the city\u2019s industrial sector.\nMayor Brandon Johnson is preparing to introduce the Hazel Johnson Cumulative Impacts Ordinance next week, legislation aimed at curbing the concentration of polluting industrial uses in Black and Brown neighborhoods, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nNamed after a Southeast Side activist, the ordinance would mark a significant shift in how industrial developments are evaluated in the city.\nThe measure would require a cumulative impact study as part of developers\u2019 applications to rezone for heavy industrial use. The studies would assess how much pollution a development would cause as well as how that would add to existing environmental burdens in neighborhoods.\nLarge projects would need planned development approval, while smaller ones would require special-use permits from the city\u2019s Zoning Board of Appeals. The ordinance would also create an environmental justice advisory board to weigh in on policies and review developer-submitted impact studies. How the board would be chosen wasn\u2019t reported.\nThe city\u2019s zoning policies have been under fire since the Biden administration, when the Department of Housing and Urban Development\nthreatened to withhold millions in grants\nover \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d policies disproportionately affecting minority communities in 2022. However, it\u2019s unlikely that Scott Turner\u2019s HUD would pursue that threat since \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d is among the words\nreportedly scrubbed\nfrom federal websites under the Trump administration.\nJohnson has said the ordinance aims to strike a balance between job creation and community health. But industrial firms and business groups say the legislative process has lacked transparency and could chill investment in underserved areas.\nThe ordinance could ultimately benefit industry by introducing clear rules and a more predictable review process, CEO of the Metropolitan Planning Council Dan Lurie said. The city needs to reckon with the long-term health and environmental costs of inaction, he said.\n\nIndustry leaders say the city hasn\u2019t collaborated meaningfully with manufacturers during the drafting process.\nMark Denzler of the Illinois Manufacturers\u2019 Association warned that without clear permitting standards, companies may avoid investing in Chicago altogether. Others echoed concern that capital-intensive industrial projects need reliable rules that won\u2019t shift after plans are submitted and leave them in the lurch.\nThe proposal is expected to be introduced at City Council next week but likely won\u2019t get a vote until summer.\nIts passage could prove difficult amid a fractured City Council, plus the mayor\u2019s low approval ratings.\nSupporters hope the measure will succeed where past efforts have failed, setting long-term zoning standards that prevent environmental harm and legal chaos, like the city\u2019s costly fight with metal-shredder General Iron.\nThen-Mayor Lori Lightfoot rescinded the company\u2019s operating permit after constructing its Southeast Side site following its\ndeparture from Lincoln Yards\n. General Iron\u2019s $100 million lawsuit with the city is still unresolved.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "A new multifamily trade on a rare non-rent-controlled building in San Francisco\u2019s Marina District is the city\u2019s most expensive per-door trade \u201cby a wide margin\u201d so far this year, according to Compass agent Adam Filly, who listed 3322 Buchanan last fall and represented the buyer in the competitive offer situation as well.\nEven though it quickly went into contract in late October, the sale closed April 1 at the request of the previous owner\u2019s estate, Filly said.\nThe winning buyer was Garrett Brasseaux, the managing principal of Cypress Capital Investments, according to the deed. He picked up the 29-unit three-story complex with an interior courtyard and parking for 45 cars for $17.5 million, or just over $600,000 per unit. That\u2019s nearly twice as much as the citywide average of $317,000 per unit for five-plus-unit buildings, according to Compass data for the first quarter of 2025.\nBrasseaux was busy in the latter half of last year, buying\nseveral other apartment buildings in the city\nin just a few months. Brasseaux declined to comment on the Marina buy, but Filly said, \u201cInstitutional quality assets on the north side of San Francisco are extremely rare and Garrett and his capital partners recognized that they may not see another opportunity like this for years to come.\u201d\nThe seller was a trust representing the estate of Emmett Hegarty, who bought the 2001-built property from developer Wilson Meany for $13.9 million in 2003, according to public records.\nFilly listed the property, which has 27 residential rentals and two commercial spaces, for $18 million on Sept. 30. It went into contract one month later after Filly received six offers, all from local investment groups or family offices, he said.\n\nThe 36,000-square-foot property elicited major interest both because it is an unusual San Francisco apartment building not subject to rent control and because there are repositioning opportunities in its 10,000 square feet of vacant commercial space, which fronts Lombard Street. Brasseaux has a \u201cstrong vision\u201d for that space, he added.\nOther than the vacant retail space, the building was 100 percent occupied at the time of sale, Filly said, with one-bedrooms renting at just under $3,000 a month and two-bedroom, two-bath units renting for between $4,000 and $5,000 a month. San Francisco one-bedroom rents are up about 10 percent this year, according to Zumper, with a monthly median of $3,200.\nUsing proforma projections for the vacant commercial space, the sale price represents a 5.7 percent cap rate, outperforming the market, which Filly said has been trading at about a 6.5 percent cap rate for larger mixed-use sales, with some as high as 7 percent.\nCap rates for five-plus-unit apartments more generally were 6.2 percent in the first quarter, according to Compass data. There were over 30 apartment sales in the first quarter, the highest Q1 count since 2018 and a 50 percent year-over-year improvement.\nFilly said that the sale was indicative of a strengthening market and that he was encouraged to see a variety of buyers, including apartment operators, tenancy-in-common developers, and even an owner-user for the commercial space, interested in a building at that price point.\n\u201cWe will continue to see other examples of how much investors believe in San Francisco\u2019s recovery in the coming months,\u201d he said.\nNot including this sale, there were only four San Francisco apartment sales over $7 million reported to the multiple listing service in the last 12 months, according to Compass. One of the biggest sales in the city so far this year is the\nNormandy Apartments in Cathedral Hill\n, which sold for $35 million and will be turned into affordable housing by the Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation. It bought the property with funding from the San Francisco Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing and Community Development and is planning a major rehabilitation of the 1968-built, 108-unit complex.\n",

        "content": "Howard Hughes Holdings is giving talks with Pershing Square Capital Management more time, again.\nThe Woodlands-based developer\u00a0 this week extended a standstill agreement with Bill Ackman\u2019s firm through April 15, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n. It marks the second such extension in the past month as negotiations continue over a\nproposal to take the company private\n.\nThe latest update keeps the door open for Ackman, who previously served as chairman of the company, to boost his control from 37.6 percent to 48 percent through a $900 million bid to buy 10 million newly issued shares at $90 each.\nThe initial deal was deemed \u201c\nunacceptable in its current form\n\u201d by a Howard Hughes committee in early March, though the company agreed to keep negotiating under the standstill.\nAckman would return as chairman and CEO of the holding company under the new plan, while David O\u2019Reilly would remain CEO of Howard Hughes Corporation, the real estate arm that oversees the firm\u2019s master-planned communities across the country.\nAckman, who spun off Howard Hughes from General Growth Properties in 2010, has long argued the company is undervalued. His bet is that cash generated from its real estate holdings \u2014 including The Woodlands in Houston, Ward Village in Honolulu, Summerlin in Las Vegas and Teravalis outside Phoenix \u2014 could be better reinvested elsewhere for greater returns.\n\nHe\u2019s pitched the take-private strategy as a path to transform the firm into a modern-day Berkshire Hathaway, using the development cash flows as a launching pad for a broader investment portfolio.\nHoward Hughes\u2019 leadership puts the company\u2019s net asset value at $118 per share, far higher than Ackman\u2019s $90-per-share bid.\nThe ongoing talks come as Howard Hughes is attempting ambitious development plays of its own, including an $80 million push to bring a major movie studio to Summerlin in partnership with Mark Wahlberg, Sony and Warner Bros. Discovery. It\u2019s also preparing to open model homes at Teravalis, a planned city west of Phoenix that could eventually house 300,000 people.\nFor now, Ackman\u2019s offer, and the future of Howard Hughes as a public company, is up in the air. The company has warned there\u2019s no guarantee a deal will be reached. But as the April 15 deadline nears, shareholders are watching closely to see whether Ackman\u2019s long game will come to fruition.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Related Fund Management unloaded five rent-stabilized properties this week in a trade valued at just 45 percent of what they fetched in 2015.\nIt\u2019s a deep cut \u2014 and a growing trend for this asset class.\nThe Bronx buildings are 100 percent rent-stabilized, according to tax records, meaning there is no shot at raising revenue beyond the\ninflation-lagging adjustments\nset by the rent guidelines board each year.\nA recent comp sold for just\n3 percent\nof the price it originally traded at. Both of these original deals were inked before the 2019 rent law was enacted, which put a de facto cap on rents and\ndecimated values\nacross the asset class.\nMore noteworthy: The latest Related deal signals a growing trend for a firm that recently took on a multi-billion dollar portfolio of rent-regulated debt \u2014 and it gives some credence to the frustrations smaller rent-regulated landlords have been airing about the 2019 legislation.\nA Related Fund Management spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe Related Companies and its affiliated entities have been quietly shedding rent-stabilized buildings in piecemeal deals, often at steep losses. A recent Crain\u2019s\nanalysis\nfound around two dozen such transactions in the past few years.\nIn one recent example, Related Fund Management let four Prospect Heights properties go for $16 million, almost\nhalf off\nwhat it paid in 2016.\nRelated Fund Management, which operates independently from the Related Companies, is not the most prolific owner of rent-stabilized properties in New York City. When\nThe Real Deal\nlast\ncounted\nin 2019, behemoth Blackstone took the cake with 13,361 units; LeFrak, Cammemby\u2019s and A&amp;E Real Estate Holdings were close contenders.\n\nStill, Related and its various ownership arms are among the largest rental landlords in the city, according to a 2020 count by\nTRD\n.\nFor years, most of the cries that the 2019 legislation has made it impossible to run rent-regulated assets have come from mom-and-pop owners. That is, smaller operators often not\ntaken seriously\nby tenant advocates and some electeds.\nNow, one of the biggest fish in New York multifamily is axing its exposure, too, a move that throws weight behind those claims, whether Related Fund Management means to or not.\nZooming in on the Bronx deal, one bedrooms at the Bronx properties fetched between $1,350 and $1,850 in recent years, according to StreetEasy. That\u2019s\u00a0a pittance compared to market-rate rents in the borough, which averaged $2,473 in February, according to the\nBronx Times\n.\nIn the same period that Related Fund Management has worked to whittle down its rent-regulated holdings, it also took on a\nmassive share\nof the asset class\u2019s debt: a 5 percent stake in failed Signature Bank\u2019s $6 billion rent-regulated portfolio.\nThe venture won the loans, split between two pools, for 56 and 60 cents on the dollar. The transaction included a\n$550 million pot of cash\nto aid workouts on distressed deals, meaning it didn\u2019t take on the risk without some buffer.\nAs for the Bronx deals, Moshe Greenzweig\u2019s Cedarbridge Management was the buyer. Cedarbridge could not be reached for comment.\nThis isn\u2019t the firm\u2019s first foray into rent-regulated housing. In 2022, an entity with the same address as Cedarbridge picked up\nthree loans\ntied to Isaac Kassirer, one of the earliest flameouts on the heels of the rent law.\nA month before Signature\u2019s collapse, the landlord took out a loan with the bank for four rent-regulated properties it bought off\nSugar Hill Capital\n, another rent-regulated landlord destroyed by the 2019 law.\n",

The financing covers the acquisition and predevelopment of the soon-to-be residential property.\nThe development partners recently closed on acquiring the property from the Durst Organization, a Metro Loft representative told\nThe Real Deal\n, while declining to cite the specific price.\nTRD\nreported in January that Werner\nwas in contract\nto buy the property for more than $100 million and was in talks with Metro Loft about the site.\nAt the time the contract was signed, the 340,000-square-foot space was about two-thirds occupied by tenants, some with \u201csticky\u201d leases, according to a source familiar, which could make it challenging to clear the way for a conversion. The deed for the sale has yet to appear in public records.\nDavid Werner and Nathan Berman\u2019s Metro Loft are planning to convert the property into approximately 430 rental units. The building will have the usual bells and whistles in terms of amenities, Metro Loft said, and ground-floor commercial space.\n\nWith financing in place, work on the project is expected to begin shortly. The developers are hoping for residents to move into the property in roughly 18 months, the Metro Loft rep added.\nMetro Loft and David Werner have become quick friends on the conversion front and Northwind has previously brought financing to the table.\nA few months ago, Northwind provided\na $135 million loan\nto the same pair of developers for their project at the former Pfizer headquarters, 235 East 42nd Street in Midtown Manhattan. Northwind also provided a $75 million loan for the development last summer.\nMetro Loft is planning to convert the former Pfizer building into more than 1,500 rental units, which would represent the largest office-to-resi conversion in New York City.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The Quay will also include 4,983 square feet of commercial space and 758 parking spaces.\nIn addition to building a new high-rise, the developers would tear down a pair of existing two-story office buildings to make way for a waterfront public plaza. An existing shopping center would remain intact, the plan shows.\n\nThe Quay would offer a mix of studios, one-, two- and and three-bedroom apartments.\nUnder the state\u2019s Live Local Act law, the project can bypass public hearings and be approved administratively because 40 percent of the apartments will be for affordable and workforce housing. The site is currently zoned for a mixed-use project with up to 361 residential units and 12,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space.\nLast year, Related, BH and Pebb paid\n$48.5 million\nfor The Quay at 17th Street. The joint venture also owns\nOcean Walk\n, a retail plaza in Riviera Beach\u2019s Singer Island, and Boca Raton\u2019s\nOffice Depot\ncampus where the partnership is planning a mixed-use project with 500 apartments, a 36,700-square-foot gym and four retail and restaurant outparcels.\nRelated has a handful of\nLive Local Act\nprojects on tap. This month, the firm\u2019s affordable and workforce housing division unveiled plans for SoMi Parc, a mixed-use project in South Miami with 8,700 square feet of retail, 501 parking spaces and 391 apartments. Related would build SoMi Parc on a county-owned 3.3-acre site.\nRelated is also seeking to replace an older public housing building for low income seniors in\nMiami\u2019s Health District\nwith a 398-unit Live Local project, as well as redeveloping a 1,379-unit public housing complex in Miami\u2019s\nLittle Havana\nwith two 21-story towers and a 12-story building with a combined 1,038 apartments.",

The Eklund Gomes report tallies properties in the multiple listing service listed at $4 million or more.\nIf the deal closes, it would cap a long-running saga for 10250 West Sunset Boulevard, which has been on and off the market for a decade and once touted an $88 million asking price.\nThe home\u2019s most recent return to the market came in mid-March after a legal tussle brought on by Yucaipa Companies founder Ron Burkle. The private equity investor\nsued\nLubov Azria claiming she \u201crefused to complete the sale\u201d of the property after he won a May auction with a $30 million bid. Burkle filed to drop the lawsuit late last year after a judge ordered him to pay just over $36,000 to Azria for legal expenses.\nThe Paul Williams-designed Colonial is 30,000 square feet with 14 bedrooms and 25 bathrooms, according to marketing materials. It sits on a nearly 3-acre lot and has a detached 5,500-square-foot building for a theater or game room. Other highlights include a tennis court, gardens and an infinity pool.\n\nThe Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Branden Williams and Rayni Williams are the listing agents.\nLast week\u2019s No. 2 contract was for a Los Angeles home at 15427 Milldale Drive, which is dubbed a \u201cModern Farmhouse\u201d in its listing. It has an asking price just under $13 million.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Steven Moritz has the listing.\nThe Milldale Drive property is about 8,000 square feet on over half an acre. It has a metal roof, fire hydrant at the foot of the driveway, motor court, views of the canyon, media room and a primary suite with a fireplace and a deck.\nOverall, Los Angeles County counted 16 contracts signed last week, equating to $138.4 million in asking dollar volume, according to Eklund Gomes. That\u2019s down from the prior reporting period ended March 30, which consisted of 25 contracts totaling\n$166.5\nmillion in asking dollar volume.\n",

        "content": "A pair of midsize multifamily portfolios sold on opposite ends of Chicago show mid-market buildings stand to benefit the most from the city\u2019s notable rent growth.\nOn the far North Side in Rogers Park, a portfolio of three courtyard-style buildings totaling 115 units sold for $16.1 million last month. The price comes out to about $140,000 per unit. Similarly, Chicago-based investor David Pezzola bought a portfolio of 110 units in the far South Side neighborhood of Beverly for $16.3 million around the same time.\nTaken together, the deals underscore how midsize multifamily buildings on the city\u2019s fringes have attracted an influx of interest from investors who can afford the properties and bank on rent growth overpowering other uncertainties in the market.\nInterra Realty\u2019s Brad Feldman represented the Rogers Park seller, longtime landlord George Triff, and said the deal represented an opportunity for the new buyer to tap into Chicago\u2019s nearly nation-leading rent growth.\nFeldman declined to share the name of the buyer of the Rogers Park portfolio, who is an individual investor. Records for the sale of the properties located at 7405, 7415 and 7415 North Damen Avenue have not been made publicly available yet.\n\u201cA lot of the units were in the $900, maybe a little bit over $1,000 rent range and could be doubled just by having the building spruced up,\u201d Feldman said.\nSean Connelly of 33 Realty represented the Beverly seller, another local multifamily investor, John Brauc.\n\u201c[The buyer] was buying it looking at the long-term ability to raise rents in this submarket,\u201d Connelly said.\nThe buildings, located at 10206 and 10500 Walden Parkway, contained a mix of market rate units and units rented out to tenants whose rents were partially subsidized by affordable housing vouchers. Pezzola assumed at least one $4 million loan tied to the portfolio that was taken out in 2022, likely at an interest rate that\u2019s lower than what could be achieved today. But the specifics of the rest of the portfolio\u2019s pricing have not been recorded publicly yet. The price comes out to $148,000 per unit.\nThe new owner plans to continue to accept vouchers, Connelly said.\nChicago\u2019s rent growth has been fueled by an influx of college-educated residents, a diverse job market and a severely constricted multifamily development pipeline. Only about 500 units are expected to come online this year, down from the 10-year average of more than 3,500 units, according to Integra Realty Resources.\n\nThe city\u2019s downtown apartment market has dominated headlines and reached new heights last year, when the average unit within a group of 84 buildings tracked by Luxury Living surpassed $3,000 for the first time ever, according to the multifamily brokerage and consultant. The mean figure landed at $3,077, up 28 percent from 2023.\nBut the market for high-end downtown building purchases has proven more stagnant because risk-averse institutional investors who typically have the capital needed to buy such properties have been hesitant to jump in.\nHigh interest rates and\nreforms to the county\u2019s property tax system\nhave muddled revenue projections and hastened the descent from a mid-2010s downtown multifamily investment boom.\nSometimes, bigger players snap up midsize properties, too.\nMultifamily giant\nMorgan Properties\nannounced last week it had bought $501 million worth of apartment buildings across the Midwest. The one building the firm chose to buy in Chicago was a midsize, 138-unit apartment building in Logan Square called NoCa Blue.\nIn Rogers Park, the recent portfolio buyer plans to perform some standard maintenance and potentially expand units to create more 2 to 3-bedroom apartments. But regardless of the renovations, the properties will benefit from growth in the neighborhood, access to downtown and the broader city\u2019s rent growth.\n\u201cPeople are always looking for a place that may have untapped value. It\u2019s equidistant to Northwestern to the north in Evanston and Loyola University to the south and in close proximity to the lake,\u201d Feldman said. \u201cYou\u2019re getting a good bang for your buck.\u201d\nUnlike Rogers Park, which is a densely populated neighborhood, Beverly is dominated by single-family homes. The scarcity of multifamily could prove to be a long-term benefit for the new owner.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not that much density. So if you buy up big chunks of the market, you can control\nthe market,\u201d Connelly said.\n",

The price comes to $639 per square foot.\nBuilt in 1957 for the late Irving B. Harris, namesake of the University of Chicago\u2019s Harris School of Public Policy, the midcentury estate sits on a nearly two-acre lot perched above Lake Michigan and includes indoor and outdoor pools, a tram down the bluff and a beachfront.\nIt asks about $640 per square foot, and Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agents Patrick Milhaupt and Linda Levin have the listing.\nThe home is part of a three-home enclave on Woodbridge Road, a stretch accessible only by a wood bridge spanning a ravine.\nIf the home sells for above $6 million, it would mark the first lakefront property in Highland Park to reach that threshold since 2021. It would also be the second-highest sale ever in the tiny bluffside pocket, behind an $11.15 million purchase in 2007 by Medline executive Andrew Mills.\n\nIrving Harris, who died in 2004, was a major force behind the creation of several Chicago institutions, including the Harris Theater for Music and Dance, WTTW/Channel 11, the Erickson Institute and a namesake auditorium at the Aspen Music Festival.\nThe home was designed for him and his first wife, Rosetta, by midcentury architect Henry Newhouse II, known for several lakefront properties across the North Shore.\nThe agents say the current owners have meticulously updated the interior while preserving the serene, minimalist aesthetic. The redesign includes cream limestone floors, a skylit hot tub alcove and a wall of east-facing windows overlooking the lake.\nThe Narulas acquired the property in 2007, but the purchase price was not recorded in public documents.\nIf sold at or near asking price, the home would further solidify Highland Park\u2019s luxury waterfront market rebound after years of sluggish high-end activity. Michael Jordan\u2019s former residence, a few miles inland at 2700 Point Lane, is the city\u2019s benchmark after\nselling for $9.5 million\nin December.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

A reporter recently counted 18 empty storefronts, with most located on the mall\u2019s top floors.\nAlderman Brian Hopkins confirmed the plans, calling the vertical mall model \u201cpast its prime\u201d and saying the building had come \u201cperilously close\u201d to becoming a white elephant.\nWater Tower\u2019s transformation reflects broader changes sweeping the Magnificent Mile. At the height of the pandemic, the retail corridor hit a 33 percent vacancy rate.\nThat figure has since improved to 26 percent, according to the Magnificent Mile Association, with recent openings from Warner Bros., Alo Yoga and Aritzia, plus upcoming attractions like a Harry Potter-themed store.\n\nLocal officials say the future of the Mag Mile lies in flexibility and reinvention. Several aging malls along the strip are being repositioned into mixed-use or experiential spaces. Nearby Chicago Place, once anchored by Saks, has already been converted to offices and residential units.\nMeanwhile, other properties are eyeing retail, dining, medical and entertainment uses to backfill empty floors.\nTourism is also playing a growing role in the corridor\u2019s rebound. Foot traffic along North Michigan Avenue has returned to 91 percent of pre-pandemic levels, and some businesses are outperforming 2019 revenue. The Magnificent Mile Association has shifted its strategy to emphasize cultural and interactive programming from Thursday through Sunday to boost non-office foot traffic.\nStill, uncertainty abounds for the corridor. The nearby six-story, 80,000-square-foot building at 830 North Michigan Avenue, for one, is vacant. Owner Fairpoint Development has not confirmed future plans for that former retail hub.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\nREAD MORE LINKS:\n",

        "content": "A multifamily design popular in older East Coast cities could soon be allowed in Austin.\nThe City Council is set to vote Thursday on whether to allow mid-rise apartments with one stairwell instead of two, a configuration common in cities like New York but banned in Austin for buildings taller than three stories, Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nSupporters say the change would enable developers to build more efficient, design-forward apartments on smaller parcels, especially in urban areas and near commercial corridors where land is scarce and costly.\nArchitect Chris Gannon, who sits on the city\u2019s building and fire board of appeals, said rules requiring two staircases and interior hallways have led to increasingly bulky buildings with shrinking unit sizes.\nThe change could enable four larger corner units per floor, more in line with family-sized layouts amid the city\u2019s \u201cbuilding bloat,\u201d he said.\nUnlike large apartment complexes that sprawl across a block or more, single-stair buildings can fit on lots as small as 10,000 square feet, potentially opening up new infill opportunities in Austin\u2019s urban core. The structures are typically five stories or fewer, making them more compatible with existing neighborhood scales.\n\nAustin isn\u2019t acting in a vacuum. Proposals in the Texas Legislature \u2014 House Bill 5148 and Senate Bill 2835 \u2014 could give cities across the state the option to legalize single-stair buildings up to six stories tall. Advocates say the move could unlock development models and invite fresh players into the market.\nAustin isn\u2019t the only city rethinking its multifamily building codes. In Los Angeles, the City Council recently\nvoted unanimously\nto eliminate the two-stair multifamily development requirement.\nThe Austin proposal caps buildings at five stories, but some local policy experts say that\u2019s only the beginning. If approved, Austin could serve as a template for broader reform across Texas.\nThe pending rule change follows other local zoning updates aimed at boosting housing supply, including the city\u2019s HOME Initiative, which\nloosened lot-size requirements\nand opened the door for more homes per parcel. But the single-stair rule would represent a shift in form on top of density changes.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

He touted the initiative on his\ncampaign site\n.\nThe other one, Partnership for San Francisco, was\nfounded by high-powered CEOs\nand corporate leaders to work with City Hall on policies supported by the business community.\nSan Francisco Downtown Development intends to raise unspecified funds it can quickly spend on projects like planting trees, lending money for small-merchant capital projects and providing bridge loans to retailers and others who want to open businesses downtown.\nOther board members include Sam Cobbs, CEO of Tipping Point Community, the anti-poverty organization founded by Lurie; Rebecca Foster, CEO of the San Francisco Housing Accelerator Fund, involved with\nan initiative to raise money for interim housing for homeless residents\n; and Olga Miranda, president of SEIU Local 87, representing janitors in downtown offices.\n\nSpeed is of the essence in raising and deploying the money needed to get projects off the ground, David Stiepleman, chief organizer and chairman of the board chair, told the Standard.\nWhile future efforts will require new legislation and other measures, \u201cthis is the \u2018Let\u2019s move now\u2019 initiative,\u201d he said.\nFirst on the burner: a fund that could be used to finance heaters for outdoor seating at restaurants, or provide loans for downtown office or retail tenants that might not qualify for credit, he said.\nStiepleman, co-president of Sixth Street, the locally based investment firm that just bought a stake in the San Francisco Giants, said the group\u2019s goal is to coordinate and centralize activities now performed by a collection of community business districts in and around downtown.\nSuch districts act as local taxing authorities, while San Francisco Downtown Development will solicit tax-deductible donations, according to the Standard.\nLurie and former Mayor London Breed have trumpeted the revitalization of downtown as critical to rebuilding San Francisco, whose office vacancy hovers at 36.6 percent.

        "content": "The Agency\u2019s Michael Biryla thought he and his seller were in the clear.\nThe potential buyer had already completed an inspection and hammered out negotiations on the contract for the $3 million Upper East Side listing. Then came the call from the buyer agent: the deal was off.\n\u201cLast night, I got a call from the broker, and they were like, \u2018Yeah, we aren\u2019t comfortable moving forward anymore,\u2019\u201d Biryla said. \u201cTheir [client\u2019s] portfolio is down like 30 percent, they said, so they\u2019re just terrified to pull that money now because they\u2019re just going to take a huge loss.\u201d\nMultiple agents, lawyers and mortgage brokers in New York say buyers are getting cold feet during one of the worst market downturns in recent history. President Trump\u2019s tariff announcement, which included taxes exceeding 50 percent for some countries like China, triggered a market sell-off that ran from Thursday through Monday.\nThe S&amp;P 500 fell nearly 10 percent that period\u2014 a steeper decline than any three-day period during the early days of Covid, nearly outpacing the largest three-day drop during the financial crisis in 2008. The fall in prices wiped out over $6.6 trillion in market value, according to the\nWall Street Journal\n.\nThe hit to asset values, as well as the cloud of uncertainty hanging over the market, have spooked buyers to the point that some are backing out of both accepted offers and signed contracts.\nData from UrbanDigs shows that the percentage of canceled New York contracts spiked to over 1 percent last week, compared to an average of .5 percent over the last three years. Compared to total contract volume, the numbers are still relatively small but speak to broader market concerns, co-founder John Walkup said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a base level that you can just attribute to \u2014 there\u2019s something wrong with the property or the financing or whatever it is that sort of flows through the background,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this extra level, it would be sort of difficult to say it has nothing to do with the macro environment backdrop.\u201d\nPeter Zinkovetsky, managing attorney at Avenue Law Firm, said he\u2019s received two requests from buyers in the past 48 hours to pull out of contracts. One asked for the 10 percent wire deposit to be returned while they tried to negotiate a new price with the seller.\n\u201cA lot of clients whose closings are coming up just lost like 20 to 25 percent of their liquidity on paper from the time that they\u2019ve applied for a mortgage,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are definitely going to be deals which will have to get canceled or buyers that will go into default if they don\u2019t have a mortgage contingency, because they won\u2019t be able to get a mortgage.\u201d\nBuyers hunting for homes are also telling agents they now need to pause their search. Coldwell Banker Warburg\u2019s Rashi Malhotra had a buyer that was planning to liquidate their company stocks in April but now can\u2019t because of the losses they would incur.\nInstead, they\u2019re continuing to rent after a six-month search.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really unfortunate,\u201d Malhotra said.\nLuxury spared, for now\nThe luxury market, perhaps thanks to its wealthy cash buyers, appears to have avoided some of the chaos.\nShaun Pappas, a partner at law firm Starr Associates, said the dozens of luxury deals his group does every week have yet to be affected.\nIn fact, buyers with cash to spare or who are tired of the marketing volatility might see real estate as a welcome port in the storm, said Douglas Elliman\u2019s Fran Katzen. \u201cWhen you have volatility, people want to dump their equity into a much more consistent, slow-performing asset \u2014 real estate,\u201d she said.\nKatzen had a buyer cash out on $2.8 million in cryptocurrency on Friday and Monday to fund an upcoming deal, despite crypto markets also suffering in recent days.\nBoston-based luxury developer Gaetano Morello is putting the finishing touches on a brownstone reconstruction that he expects to price around $15 million. He said he\u2019s not concerned about the buyer pool flinching at the price, even if it needs to increase from tariffs hitting some of the European stone tile or French ranges.\n\u201cThe ultra-high-end real estate market is relatively inelastic, given the amount of wealth that exists out there,\u201d he said.\nStill, some luxury buyers are starting to reconsider.\nMelissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis, had a client postpone closing on an all-cash deal for a multi-million dollar Hamptons home. She said he\u2019s waiting to see if the value of Hamptons real estate is going to drop significantly more than his 10 percent deposit.\nFor agents like Biryla, who are already getting burned by market-sensitive buyers, it\u2019s back to the drawing board. The two other offers, both lower than the accepted bid, had already moved on to different properties, he said.\nThe plan going forward: \u201cReset the marketing plan, blast out to every person that hasn\u2019t seen it, try to reach out to other brokers, try to reposition the property, maybe do a slight price adjustment.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A nasty fight is brewing between a Chicago affordable housing investor who owns a portfolio of far West Side buildings and its prominent property manager, RPM Living.\nThe landlord of the four-property, 375-unit portfolio is Atlanta-based Infinity Real Estate Advisors, which alleges that Austin, Texas-based RPM\u2019s \u201cmismanagement\u201d of the buildings led to \u201ccatastrophic losses\u201d totaling nearly $20 million.\nInfinity, led by CEO Gregory B. Jones, claims that RPM failed to certify the eligibility of many of the tenants of the properties for federal housing assistance programs, and their ensuing inability to pay their full rents torpedoed property values right as the landlord was seeking to refinance. The purported missteps by the property manager have prevented the landlord from obtaining a new loan and jeopardized its investments into the properties, Infinity claims.\nBut RPM is preparing to respond with allegations of its own against Infinity. RPM \u2014 which ranked as the National Multifamily Housing Council\u2019s third-largest apartment manager with more than 224,000 units last year \u2014 said it is the party that\u2019s actually owed money by the landlord, and not the other way around.\n\u201cWe are vigorously defending against these allegations and will be filing counterclaims against the plaintiffs to recover significant damages owed to us,\u201d a spokesperson for RPM said. \u201cSince this involves pending litigation, it is our policy not to comment further at this time.\u201d\nInfinity, Jones and a lawyer for his company didn\u2019t return requests for comment.\nThe properties involved in the dispute are the 158-unit Lavergne Courts at 4938 West Quincy Street; the 101-unit Washington Court at 5424 West Washington Boulevard; the Whitmore Apartments at 421 South Central Avenue; and the 62-unit Parkside Terrace at 128 North Parkside Avenue.\n\nInfinity purchased the properties for nearly $31 million last year from Mercy Housing.\nAt the Washington Courts property, which accounted for a total of $10.5 million of the purchase price, Infinity said that RPM\u2019s \u201cpoor oversight\u201d and \u201cfile maintenance\u201d left resident information in such \u201cdisarray\u201d that they weren\u2019t properly certified for the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s programs. The landlord said that 42 residents were terminated from the HUD system and Infinity is no longer receiving a HUD subsidy for them, causing shortfalls in revenue from the property.\n\u201cSome or all of this subsidy will not be recovered,\u201d Infinity said.\nSimilar allegations were made in the four separate lawsuits that Infinity affiliates filed in Cook County court against RPM over the other properties in the Chicago portfolio.\nThe Washington Courts case also described RPM\u2019s use of overpriced vendors at the buildings, alleging the property manager expended \u201cunconscionable amounts above standard costs.\u201d\nInfinity claims that it has been damaged by $12.4 million at the Washington Courts property; $6.5 million at the Lavergne Courts property; $500,000 at the Parkside Terrace property; and $300,000 at the Whitmore property.\n",

Bloomingdale\u2019s, which occupied more than 300,000 square feet at the nearly empty mall,\nclosed last month\n.\nCrime, the bane of any high-end retail area, is on the wane, however, with green shoots returning to Union Square. Next month, Nintendo is\nslated to open\non Powell Street, its second U.S. store, according to the Chronicle.\nSince taking office in January, Lurie has focused on tackling crime to raise perceptions and bring businesses back downtown.\n\u201cWe are working every day to deliver safe and clean streets in Union Square and across downtown,\u201d Lurie told the Chronicle. \u201cZara\u2019s decision to open a flagship store in Union Square is the latest vote of confidence in the future of our city.\u201d\nThe Zara lease at the 116-year-old building at Post and Powell streets mixes money with blood relations. The building is owned by Pontegadea, the Spanish-based family office and real estate holding company of Zara founder and billionaire Amancio Ortega. Terms of the lease were not disclosed.\nPontegadea bought the 61,800-square foot building in 2007 for $103 million, or $1,667 per square foot. The four-story structure has been largely vacant since\nDSW pulled out\nin 2021, per the Chronicle.\nThe Spanish investor also owns the nearby Tiffany &amp; Co. building at 350 Post Street, and Pacific Place on Market Street, the now-vacant storefront where Gap closed its Old Navy shop in 2023.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

The WeWork founder is planning the 40-story, 466-unit Flow House at 697 North Miami Avenue in\nMiami Worldcenter\n, a 27-acre mega development with more than 8,000 residential units, 499 hotel rooms and almost 800,000 square feet of commercial space in the pipeline.\nFlow House will include furnished studios and one-bedroom and two-bedroom units, with prices starting at $450,000. The tower is short-term rental-friendly, and amenities will include a pool, fitness center, spa facilities, cafes, coworking spaces, a game room and a podcasting room, its website shows.\nSales launched in October\n, with OneWorld Properties leading marketing. Flow House is expected to open later this year.\nInvictus\n, led by Eric Scheffler and Christopher Pardo; and Integritas, led by Stephen Palmese, are frequent collaborators. Earlier this month, Palmese proposed\na 57-story tower in Fort Lauderdale\nthat would have 550 apartments and a 253-key hotel.\n\n\u201cA lot of the local lenders shied away,\u201d from the Flow House loan, Palmese said, crediting their concerns to less experience with inventory loans. Lenders may have other reasons for caution when it comes to financing Neumann\u2019s projects. The billionaire was famously\nforced out of WeWork\nafter the company\u2019s failed initial public offering revealed significant losses, a crucial made-up financial metric and alleged conflicts of interest.\nFlow House was initially planned as a rental tower, with the switch to condos necessitating an inventory loan, Palmese said. Neumann\u2019s\nFlow\n, the residential real estate-focused firm he launched in 2022, was expected to focus on rental projects that foster community.\n\u201cWe learned while building Flow over the last two years that the exact same needs faced by renters are also faced by owners in terms of lack of community and lack of connectivity,\u201d Neumann told\nThe Real Deal\nwhen sales launched for Flow House last year.\nFlow is backed by the Silicon Valley-based venture giant Andreessen Horowitz, and has projects and towers in Miami, Fort Lauderdale and the capital of Saudi Arabia, Riyadh. In recent years, Neumann\nmoved to Bal Harbour\nand\nspoke at TRD\u2019s South Florida Real Estate Forum\nin November. In January, he had the winning bid to buy a 16-acre El Portal development site for\n$70.5 million\n, and landed\na $51 million\nacquisition loan for the site last month.\n",

Galbut envisions demolishing the north side of the building, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, so that\nGFO\ncan jam a 65-story mixed-use tower right up against the courthouse.\nGalbut declined comment through a spokesperson, who referred\nThe Real Deal\nto a recent press release that touts the planned project. Yet, Miami-Dade County commissioner Elieen Higgins, who is leading county negotiations with Galbut\u2019s firm, told\nThe Real Deal\nthat the county and Galbut have yet to reach an agreement, and that Miami-Dade could still back out if the terms are not favorable for taxpayers. Higgins\u2019 district includes downtown Miami.\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair, I will present a memo to the county commission that it\u2019s not a good deal,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cI am committed to having a deal that makes sense. There is not much wiggle room for me.\u201d\nOnce Miami\u2019s tallest building\nBuilt between 1925 and 1929, the 27-story Miami-Dade County Courthouse was Miami\u2019s tallest building until 1965. The courthouse\u2019s exterior features a pyramidal ziggurat roof, Roman columns at its south and north entrances and granite and terracotta cladding. Marble floors, bronze elevator doors, colorful mosaics in the ceiling and atrium lobby make up some of the interior\u2019s features.\n\u201cGenerally speaking, this is a great Neoclassical building that means a lot to Miami,\u201d said Richard Heisenbottle, a Coral Gables-based architect who specializes in historic restorations. \u201cIt was the seat of both city and county governments, and even served as a jail.\u201d\nThe courthouse cost an estimated $4 million to build, Heisenbottle said. That\u2019s roughly $74 million today when calculating for inflation. By comparison, the county\u2019s new 23-story courthouse, which is nearly complete and adjacent to the historic building, will cost taxpayers an estimated\n$267 million\n, county memos show.\nBetween the 1960s and 1980s, the city and county offices moved out of the courthouse and the building stopped serving as a jail. But the building continued to serve as the civil courthouse, serving as the legal battleground for business disputes, including major lawsuits entangling prominent developers. The courthouse is also within a national historic district, said Dr. Paul George, resident historian at HistoryMiami Museum.\n\u201cThere are a lot of hoops to jump through to be placed on the National Register of Historic Places,\u201d George said. \u201cIt\u2019s more than just a building. It\u2019s an amazing element of Greater Miami history.\u201d\nSince the early 2000s, the building has fallen into significant disrepair. A 2021 countywide review of older buildings, prompted by the Surfside condo collapse, uncovered major structural issues at the courthouse, including concrete spalling, cracks in beams and slabs, and corrosion of steel columns. The building was evacuated and was closed until December 2021 while the county made emergency repairs.\nThe county\u2019s best option is to allow a private developer to take over the building and find a new use for the courthouse, commissioner Higgins explained. \u201cHistoric buildings are incredibly expensive to maintain,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cAnd this is an active courthouse. We had to keep it operational while doing short-term fixes.\u201d\nGFO is the only bidder\n\nGalbut has been eyeing the historic courthouse since 2017, when Crescent Heights, the Miami-based national development firm he co-founded, submitted an unsolicited proposal for the building. Crescent Heights offered to build the county a new\n$300 million courthouse\nat 54 West Flagler Street, a surface parking lot that the developer owns. In exchange, the county would have allowed Crescent Heights to take over and convert the courthouse into shops and offices, published reports state. The county would also have paid Crescent Heights $18 million in annual rent for use of the new courthouse.\nThe negotiations fizzled, and Miami-Dade opted to build the new courthouse on a vacant lot abutting the Metrorail tracks at Flagler Street and Northwest First Avenue. However, the surface parking lot is again playing a major role in Galbut\u2019s current pursuit of the historic courthouse.\nAt a February meeting, the\ncounty commission\nvoted to let commissioner Higgins take charge of negotiating with GFO, after it was the only firm to respond to the county\u2019s bid to sell the courthouse. The developer offered to pay $300,000 above the county\u2019s minimum asking price of $52 million. But the offer involves giving Miami-Dade the surface parking lot and cash.\nTypically, county commissioners do not have hands-on involvement in procurement negotiations, which are handled by county departments that report directly to Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava. In 2022, the county commission approved an administrative order allowing commissioners to take the lead on negotiating deals for land the county owns, but no longer uses.\nIn recent years, the county commission approved three no-bid deals for so-called\nsurplus land\n, including two pending sales of government owned sites in Homestead and along the Miami River to groups planning projects, despite having no development experience.\nHiggins is the running point on negotiations with GFO, even though Galbut is among a bevy of local developers that she, like her county commission colleagues and Levine Cava, count on for financial political support. In 2023, 10 entities with the same address as GFO and Crescent Heights donated a combined $10,000 to a political action committee that supported Higgins\u2019 unopposed reelection last year. Last week, Higgins announced she is running for Miami mayor in this year\u2019s city election.\nHiggins insists that she will support the best deal for taxpayers, and that any sale proceeds are crucial to help pay for the new courthouse, she told\nTRD\n. She got involved to speed up the negotiations process, Higgins said.\nYet, the commissioner claimed that she\u2019s merely overseeing the negotiations process while the county\u2019s real estate professional staff and the county attorney\u2019s office are handling direct talks with GFO and Galbut.\n\u201cI have not met with the developer since the county commission gave me this permission,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cThere is no chance that I am across the table negotiating with Mr. Galbut.\u201d\nGalbut unveils plan\nShould GFO complete its purchase of the historic courthouse, the firm plans to convert the building into hospitality, retail and office uses while preserving its historical architectural integrity, a press release states.\nThe developer would seek a partial demolition of the courthouse\u2019s northern portion, so GFO could build the 65-story high-rise, which would have a mix of 800 condos and apartments, the plan shows. GFO would rebuild the interior of the courthouse\u2019s northern portion within the planned 20-foot-tall lobby of the new building.\nGalbut\u2019s plan would have to comply with all the rules of the courthouse\u2019s historic designation, Higgins said. \u201cThere\u2019s an entire document that talks about what has to be maintained for any work to be done,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no chance when you walk into that courthouse that the current exterior and interior will not remain.\u201d\nGFO\u2019s plan would also require approvals from Miami\u2019s Historic and Environmental Preservation Board and Miami\u2019s Planning, Zoning and Appeals Board, according to historian George. \u201cGalbut is a pretty responsible developer,\u201d George said. \u201cThe building really needs a lot of help structurally. We have to preserve it at all costs.\u201d",

        "content": "Developers and housing experts in Chicago are bracing for the ripple effects of a U.S. tariffs, with concerns mounting over rising construction costs, consumer jitters and broader market instability.\nPresident Dondald Trump\u2019s global tariff rollout has injected volatility into an already strained housing market.\nChicago developer Zev Salomon of ZSD said he\u2019s relieved his 149-unit River North project is geared toward rentals rather than condos, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Rent prices can adjust to market conditions in real time, while condo prices are often locked in years before delivery.\nThe tariffs are expected to increase construction costs, though estimates vary.\nThe average price of a new home may rise by $10,000, the National Association of Home Builders predicted, while Bank of America suggested material costs will increase by 1.5 percent on average, with some spikes as high as 6 percent.\nFor buyers, that could mean an extra $65 per month on mortgage payments, which some experts say is still manageable in the current interest rate environment.\nChicago-area buyers may be less rattled by the added costs, having already absorbed steep price hikes in recent years, said Jeff Benach of Lexington Homes. At Metro on Main in Morton Grove, rising labor and material costs have already pushed prices up nearly 12 percent year-over-year, with entry-level units jumping from around $444,000 to $495,000, Benach said.\n\nBut other market players warn the real risk lies in\nconsumer confidence\n.\nUncertainty about interest rates, recession fears and volatile material costs could push would-be buyers and sellers to the sidelines, said Erik Doersching of Tracy Cross &amp; Associates. With inventory already tight and sales sluggish, any additional drag could prolong the slowdown.\nThe tariffs are already straining material suppliers. Sandya Dandamudi, who runs West Loop-based GI Stone, said her firm got hit with $40,000 in surprise tariffs on Canadian stone bound for the Obama Presidential Center on March 4, the day before Trump extended the tariff deadline by another month.\n\u201cBut do I get my money back? No, of course I don\u2019t,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cThere\u2019s so much chaos.\u201d\nShe estimates costs for imported stone could rise by 40 percent.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "A dramatic surge in energy demand is coming for Texas\u2019 power grid over the next decade, driven almost entirely by the booming data center sector.\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, projected peak electricity demand could hit 218 gigawatts by 2031, more than double the state\u2019s record of 85.5 GW, set in 2023, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nRoughly 86 GW of that growth is expected to come from energy-hungry data centers alone, enough to power more than 21 million homes. The forecast represents a 37 percent increase from its own long-term projection issued just last year.\nThe projection underscores just how much Texas has become a\nmagnet for data infrastructure\n. OpenAI\u2019s upcoming \u201cStargate\u201d data center in Abilene, being developed by Denver-based Crusoe Energy, for example, is expected to draw as much as 6 GW, nearly twice the typical daily usage of the entire surrounding Rio Grande Valley.\nThe revised forecast follows a 2023 rule change requiring ERCOT, the manager for Texas\u2019 exclusive power grid, to include all potential large-scale energy users in its modeling \u2014 even those still in early planning phases.\nThe grid operator simultaneously issued a more conservative estimate, capping demand at 145 GW by 2031. But the headline number has already raised eyebrows among lawmakers and analysts.\n\nThe numbers may be inflated, but according to energy analyst Doug Lewin, the broader trend is clear: Texas is headed for significant load growth that will require a major ramp-up in energy generation.\nThe latest projection comes just months after the agency warned that, under worst-case scenarios, peak demand could outstrip power supply as early as 2027.\nSome see the 218 GW estimate as inflated, and lawmakers are still pressing for more accurate forecasting. State Sen. Phil King said some data center projects now rival the power needs of entire regions, raising questions about which commitments are real and which are speculative.\nRegardless of the final number, the private sector\u2019s power infrastructure development is unlikely to match that level of demand growth on pace, Lewin said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t ever like to say impossible, but that\u2019s about as damn near impossible as anything could be,\u201d he said.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

Trustees are expected to take a final vote on the agreement April 28.\nThe proposal calls for a four-story building called The Mylo, which would include 125 residential units and about 12,000 square feet of restaurant and retail space.\nDeveloper Joe Taylor III said he is in active negotiations for a 6,000-square-foot high-end restaurant lease and is ready to start construction immediately following the board\u2019s vote.\nThe plan includes MotorCave Auto Suites, private garages for car enthusiasts. Taylor founded the venture in 2023, and the \u201ccar condos\u201d were 67 percent\u00a0 occupied\nwithin 10 days of pre-sales opening\nlast summer.\n\nIt also ties into the village\u2019s broader plan to create Park Avenue Plaza, a public gathering space with outdoor dining. Taylor has agreed to fund construction out of his own pocket.\nUnder the terms of the draft agreement, the village would issue two TIF notes: $16 million upon substantial completion of the mixed-use building and plaza, and another $1 million once half the retail space is leased. The developer must maintain at least 50 percent retail occupancy for 10 years after completion or risk a pause in incentive payments.\nPayments will come from property tax revenue generated by the completed project.\nEligible reimbursable expenses for Taylor include land acquisition, utility work and environmental remediation, but not vertical construction.\nVillage Manager Scott Anderson said the final agreement reflects the village\u2019s original vision for the deal, with terms that work in the village\u2019s favor. Taylor was more direct: \u201cIf not for this TIF, the project probably wouldn\u2019t be feasible.\u201d\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Another piece of Hoque Global\u2019s downtown Newpark district has fallen into place, but questions still loom.\nAfter years of assembling land and teasing renderings, Hoque closed on the final parcel for its proposed Newpark district in downtown Dallas, a long-planned, mixed-use hub pitched as a magnet for tech firms, education and major employers, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe firm bought 711 South Saint Paul Street, formerly a homeless shelter, from the city of Dallas following its demolition late last year.\nThe half-acre property fills a critical gap in the developer\u2019s broader 20-acre Newpark vision, which includes office space, retail, mixed-income housing and a hotel.\nHoque Global said the district is intended to function as a walkable connection between major nodes in the city\u2019s core and is designed to support workforce development. The firm is seeking corporate anchors, such as large financial services firms, to help bring the project to life.\nWhile the land acquisition marks progress for Newpark, it also brings fresh scrutiny to Hoque Global\u2019s track record.\n\nThe firm has yet to deliver any of its marquee developments despite years of highly ambitious announcements.\nIts 270-acre University Hills project in southern Dallas, touted as a transformative investment for an underdeveloped part of the city, is under pressure. Hoque has until May 12 to\nclose on the land\nand until August to secure funding, per its agreement with the city.\nThe firm\nmissed a vertical construction deadline\non its $50 million Mansfield project last year and was\ndropped\nas the master developer for Fort Worth\u2019s Evans and Rosedale Urban Village after the city cited delays.\nHoque has pushed back on some of the criticism, insisting the firm is playing the \u201clong game\u201d on transformative projects that require patient capital and city cooperation. But skepticism remains as each new announcement is met with reminders of stalled timelines.\nThe firm is also partnering with PegasusAblon\u2019s Mike Ablon on a $350 million effort to redevelop Bank of America Plaza, Dallas\u2019 tallest tower, with plans for a hotel conversion and retail offerings.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

It turned the property over to nonprofit developer Neighborhood Restore and private manager Lemle and Wolff, who plan to renovate the building and put tenants on the path to homeownership with permanently affordable co-ops.\nThe landlord, David Kornitzer, racked up numerous financial penalties and housing violations, roiling tenants and tenant organizers. As of February, the listed property owner owed the city $28 million in back taxes, emergency repair fees and other penalties.\nThere are also more than 600 open housing violations, according to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, including 245 \u201cimmediately hazardous\u201d violations like mold, hot water outages and broken locks.\nAt least as early as last February, Kornitzer appeared willing to give up the building, according to email communications with Neighborhood Restore. Residents stopped paying rent as the problems multiplied: a rent arrears report from this February entered into court records said tenants owed $3.2 million.\n\nNew Day Housing Corporation and Romad Realty were also listed as owners of the property. Kornitzer did not comment on the situation to Gothamist.\nThe seizure is a first for the city\nsince it stopped\nthe Third Party Transfer program in 2019. Officials argued the building could be taken because it was on an earlier list of buildings eligible to be seized under the program.\nCity Council Housing Committee Chair Pierina Sanchez \u2014 whose district includes the Davidson Avenue property \u2014\nintroduced legislation\nlast year to bring back the Third Party Transfer program, but with protections for small owners disproportionately hurt in the past.

The names of the companies were not disclosed.\nThe court-approved settlement requires the owners of 1449 Powell Street to pay $780,000 in civil penalties and abate four remaining violations.\nPatel, who bought 790 Vallejo Street and 912 Jackson Street in May 2023, will pay $30,000 in civil penalties, according to the Chronicle.

        "content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs sent real estate stock prices on a rollercoaster.\nThey tumbled last week\namid concerns from all corners of the industry over sky-high pricing and added costs. Days later, a fake headline posted to social media platform X claiming a pause on tariffs sent stocks briefly soaring, only to tumble back down after the news was debunked.\nBut Trump officially reversed course on Wednesday afternoon, announcing he would drop tariffs to 10 percent on most countries in a 90-day pause on the planned tax hikes on imported goods to allow for trade negotiations.\nWhile granting a reprieve to many of the U.S.\u2019s trading partners, Trump ratcheted up the intensity on China, raising tariffs to 125 percent in response to the retaliatory 84 percent rate imposed by the country on U.S. imported goods.\nThe S&amp;P 500 rose almost 8 percent following the announcement, marking its largest single-day gain in five years and wiping out a large chunk of the losses incurred in recent days. The index has fallen over 8 percent since the start of the year.\nReal estate stocks, which experienced even sharper decreases in the past four days, have followed the overall rally.\nCompass, which despite the recent losses is up for the year, gained 4.5 percent as of publication. Douglas Elliman rose 7.8 percent and Anywhere Real Estate 8.2 percent from their open prices, while Re/Max was up 6.5 percent.\nZillow is also up 4.5 percent.\n\nReal estate investment trusts swelled even more. Vornado is up over 10 percent, SL Green is up for 7 percent and Hudson Pacific Properties is up nearly 13 percent.\nCommercial brokerages Jones Lang LaSalle is up over 6 percent and Newmark is up over 8 percent.\nDespite the positive swings on Wednesday, the market \u2014 and real estate stocks \u2014 are still down over the past five days. Despite a double-digit rebound, Hudson Pacific Properties is still down over 15 percent since Wednesday.\nThe one clear loser today is Rocket Companies, which continued its downward slide in response to the 10-year treasury yield soaring. If that metric remains elevated, the conglomerate\u2019s mortgage origination business could be threatened.\nThe immediate gains are a small upside to the latest unexpected move by the administration. Uncertainty has weighed on consumers and is likely to continue, according to Realtor.com chief economist Danielle Hale.\n\u201cBecause tariffs will undermine economic growth, a pause on the worst of the announcement is certainly a welcome update,\u201d Hale\ntold the site\n. \u201cThat said, given how many changes we\u2019ve seen in the last week, uncertainty remains high.\u201d\nhttps://therealdeal.com/national/2025/03/16/trump-tariffs-drive-up-housing-costs/ https://therealdeal.com/national/2025/02/11/trumps-steel-aluminum-tariffs-to-hammer-homebuilders/ ",

        "content": "For some Brickell residents, a planned 80-story condo tower behind First Miami Presbyterian Church is far from a blessing.\nSince at least 2021, Arnaud Karsenti\u2019s 13th Floor Investments and the Ardid family\u2019s Key International have wanted to develop the project on a site immediately east of the church at 609 Brickell Avenue. The site now consists of a parking lot and a school building. The church would remain intact.\nBut condo owners at IconBrickell Tower II and other nearby condo buildings have decried the potential for additional strain on already congested roads and the loss of open space. They say they are not opposed to development, but the planned project is \u201cirresponsible\u201d in the densely built out neighborhood. And they also take issue with the plan to include the school building in the development site, arguing that it allows the developers to build a bigger tower with more units than if they were only building on the parking lot.\nOn Thursday, city commissioners will consider opponents\u2019 appeal to reverse the Miami Historic and Environmental Preservation Board\u2019s decision in December to strip the school building from its historic designation. If commissioners overturn the board\u2019s decision, they also will consider opponents\u2019 request for intervenor status in any new hearing in front of the historic board.\n\u201cThe developer wanted more property. So [the church] petitioned to have the back side of the church be declassified [from its historic designation] to have more space for this 80-story monstrosity,\u201d said George Simon, an IconBrickell Tower II unit owner.\nThe Brickell Homeowners Association is among the project\u2019s opponents. Many office tenants in the financial district and condo associations in\nBrickel\nl and\nBrickell Key\nalso oppose it, Simon said.\nThe dispute has pitted 13th Floor, Key International and the church against the opponents.\nIn a statement, 13th Floor said the deal would help the church \u201csecure long term financial viability,\u201d and that it has worked closely with the community on its plans. The project will include an installation of a new seawall and an expansion of the public bayfront walkway.\n\u201cThe church school annex in question, which was a later addition to the historic church, lacks architectural or historical significance,\u201d 13th Floor said. \u201cIt is disappointing to see a small group of neighbors attempting a last-minute effort to use the historic review process as a pretext to delay a carefully planned project.\u201d\nFirst Miami Presbyterian Church, designed in the Mediterranean Revival style by Lester Geisler, was completed in 1949. A one-story school annex was added in 1953, and its second story was completed in the early 1960s, according to city records. The city designated the entire property as historic in 2003.\nSome former and current members of the congregation take issue with how the pastor shepherded church members\u2019 votes to approve the land deal. The vote was held in 2021 over Zoom, when the church still was closed amid the pandemic, disenfranchising members who didn\u2019t have access to Zoom and in possible violation of Florida law on nonprofits, said church member Cary Tolley.\n\nTolley lost his\nfight against the land deal\nwaged through the Presbyterian legal system. In his view, potential funds from the deal \u201cinfluenced \u2026 improper decisions all the way up the line in the church,\u201d Tolley said, referring to Presbyterian authorities.\nAs of 2022, First Miami Presbyterian Church\u2019s sale of the development site was expected for\n$240 million\n. The Presbytery of Tropical Florida, the body that oversees Southeast Florida churches, had signed off on the land sale.\nThe pastor \u201cpoliticked,\u201d calling some members to urge them to vote in favor, Simon said, adding that he thinks most of the sale proceeds won\u2019t stay with the Brickell church, but will go toward the Presbytery.\nSimon also alleges that opponents are being silenced. A Change.org petition that garnered about 1,400 signatures since it was posted in late March was taken down after someone flagged it, Simon said.\nFirst Miami Presbyterian Church Rev. Dr. Christopher Benek said he asked Change.org to take down opponents\u2019 petition, arguing it had a lot of inaccuracies. Change.org is \u201cvery, very careful about what they have taken down,\u201d Benek said.\nSale proceeds will stay with the Miami church, with some to be used for the preservation of the sanctuary, he said. \u201cWe see this not as the fruit of this deal. We see this as the seed that will allow us to grow in Miami,\u201d Benek said.\nBenek didn\u2019t deny that he reached out to members regarding the sale. \u201cI urge them to vote their conscience,\u201d he said.\nTraffic will be alleviated because Key Point Christian Academy, which now operates at the school building, will move to Miami\u2019s Omni neighborhood, he added.\nAt its December meeting, Miami\u2019s historic board turned down opponents\u2019 request to intervene in the declassification of the school building.\n\u201cThe spirit of the law is fairly clear,\u201d Simon said. \u201cThe point here is for citizens to make their points of view known. \u2026 Let us have our day in court.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Federal prosecutors have launched a probe into waste and corruption tied to money to fight homelessness in Southern California, without any evidence of wrongdoing.\nNewly appointed U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli announced a Homelessness Fraud and Corruption Task Force to investigate spending on homelessness across seven counties,\nCity News Service reported\n. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called it a \u201cfishing expedition.\u201d\nThe task force will include federal prosecutors from the Major Frauds Section, the Public Corruption and Civil Rights Section and the Civil Division\u2019s Civil Fraud Section of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California, based in Los Angeles\nThe probe will be assisted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of Inspector General, and IRS Criminal Investigation.\nInvestigators will scrutinize spending to battle homelessness in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties.\n\u201cCalifornia has spent more than $24 billion over the past five years to address homelessness,\u201d Essayli said in a statement. \u201cBut officials have been unable to account for all the expenditures and outcomes, and the homeless crisis has only gotten worse.\n\u201cTaxpayers deserve answers for where and how their hard-earned money has been spent.\u201d\nIf investigators find that any federal laws were violated, \u201cwe will make arrests,\u201d he added.\nEssayli, a twice-elected member of the state Assembly representing parts of the Inland Empire, was\nsworn in April 2\nas the U.S. attorney for the Central District of California after his appointment by Attorney General Pam Bondi.\nLos Angeles County has more than 75,000 homeless residents, of which more than 45,000 are in the City of Los Angeles. The combined homeless population of the remaining six counties is more than 20,000, according to Essayli\u2019s office.\n\nFor years, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority has faced allegations of waste, inefficiency and lack of transparency. The Los Angeles City Council and the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors just\nmoved to withdraw\nfrom the joint city/county agency responsible for spending hundreds of millions for homeless services.\nLast month, a court-ordered audit found that homelessness services provided by the city and county of Los Angeles were \u201cdisjointed,\u201d while containing \u201cpoor data quality and integration\u201d and lacking financial controls to monitor contracts for compliance and performance.\n\u201cAny exploitation of the homelessness crisis via the theft of funds intended to improve conditions cannot and will not be tolerated,\u201d Akil Davis, assistant director in charge of the FBI field office in Los Angeles, said in a statement.\nDespite the hazy oversight at the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, federal prosecutors cited no evidence for the alleged waste and corruption, or a \u201ctheft of funds\u201d and \u201cfraudulent schemes and corrupt officials\u201d alleged by Davis.\nBass worries the U.S. attorney could target the wrong people.\n\u201cI am very concerned that he could go off in a direction that would amount to a fishing expedition,\u201d Bass told KNX News. \u201cOur purpose is to end homelessness, and especially street homelessness, and we do not need to be distracted away from our No. 1 mission.\u201d\nLast year, the city bucked national increases with a 10 percent decrease in street homelessness, according to a homeless count.\n\u201cThese results are in part due to increased accountability and transparency around results and budgeting,\u201d Clara Karger, press secretary for the mayor, said in a statement.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "Tenants at Ellis Lakeview in Chicago\u2019s South Shore neighborhood started off the year desperate for a new owner at their apartment complex. Their building had problems, like broken boilers, pest infestations and clogged sewers, which had worsened under an old landlord, an entity called Apex Chicago. Some tenants went on a rent strike.\nBut this wasn\u2019t just any landlord-tenant dispute.\nGovernment-sponsored Freddie Mac owns Ellis Lakeview after it took control following a foreclosure on that previous landlord, an entity with links to some of the real estate investors whose\nnames\nwere on a recently revealed Fannie Mae blacklist:\nBoruch \u201cBarry\u201d Drillman\n, Chaim Puretz and Oron Zarum.\nBy March 2024, months before the foreclosure sale, Fannie had placed eight real estate investors on this blacklist, a rare move that prevented the investors, who included the Ellis Lakeview trio, from doing business with the government-sponsored agency.\nThe owners on the list bought properties, deferred maintenance and ran the buildings into the ground, an internal email from Fannie Mae obtained by\nThe Real Deal\nwarned. And when things got bad, the investors would flip property to a related party or inflate the financials.\nThe strategy\nallowed the players to buy properties with no equity.\nThe blacklisted investors owned properties across the U.S. But Chicago, with its cheap prices relative to other large cities, upside potential from a slew of planned developments and eager sellers, was a prime target. What happened after they purchased these local buildings gives a sense of how to get on Fannie\u2019s bad side.\nAt their peak, the investors managed companies with at least 1,235 Chicago-area apartment units. They bought other asset classes as well. Drillman owned an industrial development in the Gage Park neighborhood. Meanwhile, another blacklisted investor, David Helfgott, controls an office building in Rockford.\nBetween 2017 and 2021, the eight investors spent at least $97 million for properties in the Chicago area and secured $101 million in debt against them, according to a\nTRD\nanalysis.\nMultiple buildings controlled by the blacklisted investors have fallen into foreclosure. Freddie Mac seized the 105-unit South Shore property from a Zarum-led entity. Fannie is also foreclosing on LLCs tied to Moshe Silber and Gottesman that own a portfolio of more than 150 units on the South and West sides.\nIn addition to Drillman, Gottesman and Zarum, Fannie put five others on this blacklist \u2014 including Fred Schulman, Chaim Puretz,\nMoshe \u201cMark\u201d Silber\n, Israel Katz and Helfgott. In total, Fannie had exposure of more than $700 million in loans to these players as of March 2024. Many of these sponsors had ties to\nLakewood, New Jersey,\nand conducted business with each other.\nDrillman, Silber and Schulman have\npleaded guilty\nfor their role in a criminal mortgage fraud scheme in a Cincinnati rental complex. Silber and Schulman were\nsentenced\nto prison time.\nThe Chicago Gamble\nParts of Chicago\u2019s South Side became a magnet for real estate speculation over the last decade. Investors bet prices would rise around the planned 19-acre Obama Presidential Center in the Jackson Park neighborhood, as well as the slow-moving, multi-billion dollar redevelopment of the former Michael Reese Hospital site known as Bronzeville Lakefront, industry sources told\nTRD\n.\nSpeculators\u2019 gambles may prove lucrative in years to come. But during the in-between years, many investors, including Drillman, Gottesman and Silber, were stuck with their buildings, many requiring substantial repairs.\nIn the case of Ellis Lakeview, problems continued, even under Freddie Mac. More than a year after Freddie moved to foreclose on Ellis Lakeview, it has not been able to sell the property. In late February, 17 tenants said they planned to withhold portions of their rents over living conditions they contend are still in violation of city and federal regulations, the Hyde Park Herald\nreported\n.\n\u201cOver the past two years, Freddie Mac Multifamily has implemented a series of policy and process enhancements that further strengthen underwriting due diligence, bolster fraud detection and deterrence, and mitigate other risks,\u201d a spokesperson from Freddie said in a statement. \u201cWe take issues of fraud and abuse seriously and work closely with stakeholders across the industry to implement best practices for managing risk and improving our execution.\u201d\nThe city has flagged building code violations at other blacklisted investors\u2019 Chicago properties. At least one building owned by a member of the blacklist became so run down and neglected that it was host to regular gang activity, according to a person familiar with the property.\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to raise interest rates only added pressure on the investors. But these landlords seemed to want to hold onto their properties, sitting back while values increased, and spending little on upkeep.\n\n\u201cThe South and West sides of Chicago are management intensive. You can\u2019t operate as a landlord here from Skokie, let alone New Jersey,\u201d one Chicago landlord said.\nThe blacklisted investors and several of their attorneys either didn\u2019t return requests for comment, or attempts to reach them were unsuccessful.\nThe WJ portfolio\nIn 2017, an unknown investor named Boruch \u201cBrian\u201d Gottesman scooped up a portfolio of more than 600 units in Chicago\u2019s South and West sides for upwards of $33 million. The properties were owned by WJ Management\u2019s Wafeek \u201cWally\u201d Aiyash, a businessman who started selling off his real estate in the mid-2010s after being convicted of trying to bribe a Chicago alderman, according to Crain\u2019s.\nBy 2017, Gottesman was a big buyer of such property. He secured about $42 million in financing from Arbor Realty Trust, which was then sold to Fannie Mae. At some point, two other names started showing up on legal documents: Moshe Silber and Fred Schulman. Silber, then in his late 20s and hailing from Suffern, New York, and Schulman, an attorney in his late 60s who was friends with Silber\u2019s father, worked together on real estate acquisitions across the U.S.\nIt is unclear if this deal led Gottesman to be placed on Fannie\u2019s blacklist. So far no criminal allegations have been brought against any of the blacklisted players for Chicago real estate deals.\nBut around the same time Gottesman was placed on the blacklist, he was pushed by Fannie Mae to sell part of his Chicago portfolio because of the poor property conditions, according to a source familiar with the matter. Jeffrey Zwick, a Brooklyn-based real estate transaction lawyer, was also the closing attorney for Gottesman\u2019s Chicago deals, public records show. Further, Fannie stopped doing business with Zwick at least until it completes an investigation of him, the Promote\nreported\n. (Zwick did not return a request for comment).\nAffiliates of Chicago-based WPD Management, an experienced operator in the West Side of Chicago, acquired the portfolio for an undisclosed price.\nWPD ultimately assumed $23.8 million in Fannie Mae loans on the property. WPD was also required to put millions more into the building repairs.\nBut it took a painstaking negotiation. The seller \u2014 an entity tied to Schulman, Silber and Gottesman \u2014 dragged its feet on closing the sale to WPD after realizing Fannie would require it to pay down a chunk of the loan balance before walking away from the properties, according to a source familiar with the matter.\nThere were still expensive renovations required of the new ownership. So, the sellers fought to minimize payments to their lender.\nFannie and the lenders have explored trying to find new borrowers to take on other Chicago properties owned by members of the blacklist. But they haven\u2019t found any more takers, according to a source familiar with the matter.\nInstead, Fannie pursued foreclosure against the landlords in Cook County court. These properties are encumbered by $6.7 million in debt and include two buildings at 5248 and 5300 South Martin Luther King Drive in Washington Park and a third at 7600 South Essex Avenue in South Shore.\nFannie is also pursuing a foreclosure for a $3.3 million loan tied to apartments at 5644 West Washington Boulevard and 114 and 124 North Parkside Avenue in the Austin neighborhood.\nThe government-sponsored agency will take them over, as at Ellis Lakeview, and they\u2019ll likely be marketed for sale after a while.\nAt least at Ellis Lakeview, the new owner hasn\u2019t solved the tenants\u2019 problems. Freddie brought in a property manager who threatened tenants with eviction lawsuits for withholding rent, sources familiar with the matter said.\nThe tenants claim they followed all necessary procedures to legally withhold rent from a landlord who fails to maintain adequate building conditions. They, in turn, are considering filing a lawsuit against building management and ownership to prevent eviction suits from moving forward. They also want to force Freddie to negotiate a contract with any new owner that includes pledges to maintain the building in line with local and federal codes.\nTime will tell whether they can find such an owner \u2014\na real operator\nwho will invest to make the buildings competitive again \u2014 or just another gambler who seeks to limit expenses while hoping interest rates fall, property values rise and regulators look the other way.\n",

        "content": "A Chicago real estate broker has been sentenced to four years and two months in federal prison for orchestrating a multimillion-dollar fraud that duped investors out of more than $3 million.\nStanislav \u201cSteve\u201d Sannikov, 42, pleaded guilty last year to a federal wire fraud charge for misrepresenting real estate investment opportunities through his company, Chestnut Realty Group. Sannikov told investors he could negotiate the purchase of properties on their behalf, then re-sell or lease the assets at a profit, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Illinois.\nBut federal prosecutors said the properties were not for sale or lease, and in some cases did not exist as viable investment options.\nSannikov directed his victims to deposit earnest money into what he described as an escrow account maintained by Chestnut Realty. In reality, the account was a checking account he personally controlled, and Chestnut was not licensed to act as an escrow agent.\nHe then used the investor funds to bankroll his own lifestyle, authorities said. One victim, a man in his 70s, was forced to delay retirement to cover the losses.\n\nThe scheme targeted at least four individuals between 2016 and 2020. Sannikov was ordered by U.S. District Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow to pay more than $2.19 million in restitution to the victims on Friday.\n\u201cThis was not a one-time lapse in judgment,\u201d said Assistant U.S. Attorney Sheri H. Mecklenburg during sentencing. \u201c[Sannikov], over the course of at least four years, designed and engaged in a calculated, sustained, multi-faceted scheme to defraud multiple individuals.\u201d\nSannikov\u2019s conviction is one extreme addition to a growing list of Illinois real estate professionals who have come under scrutiny in recent years for misusing client funds, falsifying deal terms or overstating investment opportunities.\nLast fall, Chicago broker Diego Torres had his\nlicense revoked\nafter allegedly defrauding multiple Latino homebuyers out of nearly $190,000 through a series of fabricated foreclosure sales.\nOffenders featured in\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\n\u201cBrokers Behaving Badly\u201d investigative saga include brokers Milla and Andrew Russo, who were\nfound by a court to have made \u201cdeceptive claims\u201d\nand altered a contract to falsely claim commission on a $4.9 million beachfront home sale in Jupiter, Florida. Florida\u2019s Real Estate Commission dismissed complaints against them despite the 2022 ruling, allowing them to continue operating without penalty.\n",

The UFL deal was the market\u2019s largest lease in nearly two years.\nVacancy remained steady at 17.8 percent, and Class A space outperformed older Class B properties in five of the market\u2019s six submarkets. The Arlington/Mansfield submarket led the charge in absorption, with flight-to-quality moves pushing newer inventory ahead of legacy offices.\nRising demand for high-end space and limited availability are pushing companies toward newer developments. Firms are increasingly rethinking their office needs to favor plentiful in-building and neighborhood amenities.\n\nDowntown Fort Worth, Clearfork, the Cultural District and West Seventh are among the most sought-after submarkets, and Class A availability is at a record low.\nA 50,000-square-foot office development in Clearfork is nearly 80 percent pre-leased, and more than 400,000 square feet of office developments are set to start this year in the Cultural District and Clearfork.\nWells Fargo is planning to exit its namesake downtown tower in a planned\nmove to Clearfork\n, where it will anchor a Simon Property Group and Cassco Development Company mixed-use development.\nFort Worth has long lagged behind Dallas in terms of office leasing momentum, but the latest numbers suggest a shift. Large-block spaces are growing scarcer, and newer buildings are drawing tenants away from legacy towers. It portends continued shuffling within the market and fresh demand for premium office space.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

A few months ago, Vanbarton landed a\n$280 million loan\nfrom Adi Chugh\u2019s TYKO Capital for the acquisition and construction of the residential redevelopment.\n\nVanbarton purchased the property from Sage Realty for $95.5 million. The conversion is expected to yield as many as 600 residential units.\nAny six-figure lease is a positive development for Manhattan\u2019s office market, but the Union Investment still has plenty of space to fill at 140 Broadway. There\u2019s still 300,000 square feet available at the 51-story, 1.25-million-square-foot property,\nLast year, Union Investment and Nuveen Real Estate\nsold a recently renovated retail condominium\nat 636 Sixth Avenue. Sources told\nThe Real Deal\nthat the buyer was the Hotel and Gaming Trades Council and the building went for more than $70 million.\nManhattan office leasing volume\nhit 12.2 million square feet\nin the first quarter, the highest level of activity since the fourth quarter of 2019, according to Savills. Availability tightened too, especially in Class A buildings: the overall availability rate was 17.7 percent, down from 20 percent a year ago.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A case of Palm Beach house-hopping has amounted to more than $67 million in residential deals on the island.\nHedge funder Ara Cohen is linked to the recent $15.5 million sale of a non-waterfront Palm Beach house, which also ties him to a $51.6 million purchase of a lakefront trophy home last summer.\nRecords show Palm Tea Trust sold the house at 234 Eden Road for $15.5 million to another trust named for the address, with attorney Daniel R. Cooper signing on behalf of the buyer. Property records show that seller\u2019s mailing address as 200 Via Palma, a lakefront mansion that was purchased in July for\n$51.6 million\n. The Via Palma buying entity, Geats LLC, later signed a 99-year lease with Cohen and Sophie Stenbeck.\nCohen is a co-founder of Knighthead Capital Management, a New York-based hedge fund with $9 billion in assets under management. He is also on the board of the Professional Fighters League, a professional league for mixed martial arts (MMA) fighters, and is on the board of directors for the Palm Beach Synagogue, according to his firm\u2019s website.\n\nCohen bought the Eden Road house for $9.2 million in 2020, according to property records. It was built on 0.3 acres in 1990, and spans 4,300 square feet, with five bedrooms, six bathrooms, one half-bathroom and a pool, records show.\nIt hit the market for $20 million in May, according to Zillow. Suzanne Frisbie with the Corcoran Group had the listing, and Christian Angle with Christian Angle Real Estate brought the buyer.\nPalm Beach real estate players say house-hopping has proven to be a significant driver of the island\u2019s luxury market in recent years. In 2023, designer Tom Ford\ndropped $51 million\non a non-waterfront estate,\nonly to trade for a larger mansion\nwith a tennis court a few months later. The deal was reportedly worth more than $100 million.

        "content": "Affordable housing giant Fairstead and partner-turned-competitor Will Blodgett have been locked in a messy divorce for over three years. Who won arbitration? It depends on who you ask.\nAn April 2 decision says affordable housing giant Fairstead \u201csubstantially prevailed,\u201d and agreed with claims that the firm\u2019s former co-founder Blodgett plotted to take over the company before he was fired and launched competitor Tredway. But after the decision, Blodgett expects to walk away with tens of millions of dollars.\nBlodgett\u2019s legal team sees the decision, along with an earlier one out of a Delaware court, as a decisive win related to his claim that Fairstead is wrongfully denying him a portion of the firm\u2019s profits.\nFairstead, however, argues that a court in Delaware will make that determination \u2014 and that the arbitration decision is a resounding victory for the company. The arbiter, after all, agreed that Blodgett misused the company\u2019s proprietary information and enlisted other employees in a plan to take control of the company.\nOne point of agreement: The fight between Blodgett and Fairstead is far from over.\nFairstead, which was founded in 2013 by Jeffrey Goldberg, Stuart Feldman and Blodgett, now has $7.8 billion in assets and projects in the pipeline and more than 25,000 housing units across 28 states. As the company rapidly grew over the years, Blodgett and other employees grew increasingly frustrated that they couldn\u2019t share directly in the company\u2019s success through equity stakes.\nMost of Blodgett\u2019s compensation consisted of carried interest, or a portion of the profits from the company\u2019s special-purpose property ownership subsidiaries. Frustration over the compensation schema led to discussions about restructuring the company, which the arbitrator characterized as Blodgett\u2019s attempts to take control of the firm.\nBy September 2021, Blodgett was terminated, and Fairstead indicated that his interest in the subsidiaries would be canceled. Blodgett filed a lawsuit in response,\nalleging\nthat Fairstead wrongfully deprived him of tens of millions of dollars in profits after he left and started a new firm, Tredway. In a countersuit, Fairstead\naccused\nBlodgett of a conspiracy to drive out the other two leaders at Fairstead and downloading a trove of the company\u2019s documents with the intent to take control of Fairstead or form his own firm.\nThe company cited these activities as its reasons for firing Blodgett and depriving him of carried interest.\n\nThe April 2 decision shot down Blodgett\u2019s argument that he was fired from Fairstead in September 2021 without reason. Arbitrator Kathleen Roberts found that, in his quest to control Fairstead or create a spinoff firm, Blodgett violated the firm\u2019s confidentiality terms and his fiduciary duties as an employee. She pointed to the fact that Blodgett forwarded internal Fairstead documents to the family offices of his in-laws, the Tisch and Sussman families, \u201cfor the purposes of aiding his takeover plans, or if that failed, his new venture efforts.\u201d\nRoberts described Blodgett as \u201cdetermined if not obsessed\u201d with taking control of Fairstead, minimizing the role of Feldman and Goldberg or alternatively, forming a separate entity funded by \u201cthe family offices of his billionaire in-laws.\u201d\nThe decision also, however, stated that \u201cBlodgett is entitled to a declaration\u2026 that the Employment Agreement does not entitle any Respondent to cancel Blodgett\u2019s entire interests.\u201d Instead, his violation of the employment agreement means he must \u201cforfeit his interests in pending transactions.\u201d\nA February decision out of a Delaware court found that provisions of operating agreements governing the special-purpose property ownership subsidiaries \u201c[do] not provide an affirmative termination or forfeiture right\u201d related to Blodgett\u2019s interests.\n\u201cThe core issue in this case is straightforward: Did Fairstead have the right to take Mr. Blodgett\u2019s equity? The legal system has answered with a resounding no,\u201d Jacob Buchdahl, an attorney with Susman Godfrey for Blodgett, said in a statement. \u201cMr. Blodgett won, as both the Arbitrator and the Delaware Chancery Court have ruled in his favor and made it clear that Fairstead had no right to appropriate tens of millions of dollars of his equity. That fact is indisputable.\u201d\nFairstead does dispute it, pointing to the fact that the Delaware decision did not address two other ongoing claims related to the operating agreements. It expects the forfeiture of Blodgett\u2019s interests to be addressed later in court.\n\u201cWe are pleased that the arbitrator found that Mr. Blodgett engaged in widespread misconduct including outright theft of Fairstead\u2019s property and breaches of his fiduciary duties,\u201d Michael Carlinsky, an attorney with Quinn Emanuel for Fairstead, said in a statement. \u201cThe Arbitrator forfeited his pending interests and further consequences of his conduct, including forfeiture of his other interests, will be addressed in subsequent court proceedings.\u201d\nThe arbitrator indicated that while Fairstead did not prevail on all of its claims, it should be awarded attorneys\u2019 fees because it \u201csubstantially prevailed on the critical claims and issues presented in arbitration.\u201d The fees will be calculated according to attorney services related to Fairstead\u2019s successful claims.\nStill, the arbitrator rejected Fairstaid\u2019s claim that Blodgett owed the company more than $34 million for failing to disclose a business opportunity in the form of an off-market transaction in March 2022. The decision also found that Fairstead did not prove that Blodgett \u201cused Fairstead\u2019s information to obtain an advantage over competitor,\u201d or tried to usurp the company\u2019s business opportunities.\n",

In Brooklyn, the median rent hit $3,700, a 6 percent pop year over year; In Queens, it touched $3,450, nearly 8 percent more than a year ago.\nFor years, the story of rising rents was largely about interest rates. As the Federal Reserve hiked rates, would-be homebuyers were dissuaded by higher borrowing costs, delayed their purchase plans and instead, held fast to leases. The trend drove up rents.\nNow, it\u2019s President Donald Trump\u2019s volatile policy decisions driving the bus.\n\u201cWe\u2019re at peak uncertainty,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThere is no apparent plan or strategy.\u201d\nTrump, who has been teasing hefty tariffs since taking office in January, last week announced a baseline 10 percent tariff on nearly all nations, then tacked on reciprocal tariffs for 60 countries. Chaos ensued: Wall Street freaked, the S&amp;P 500 suffered a correction, and mortgage rates and projections of recession risk resultingly surged.\nMarket mayhem is no friend to investment, and New York City brokers told\nThe Real Deal\nbuyers immediately began\nbacking out of deals.\nThough that stymied activity was not reflected in Miller\u2019s March report, mounting uncertainty was.\nRents remained near records last month because prospective buyers, eyeing economic upheaval, weren\u2019t chomping at the bit to buy their first home. Nor were they jumping to pay the higher mortgage rates Trump\u2019s global trade shakeup drove.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the White House rolled back a key piece of its tariff plan, instituting a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs. The outlier was China, which was hit with an even higher rate of 125 percent \u201cbased on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World\u2019s Markets,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.\nOtherwise, the baseline 10 percent, and seemingly, the 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminium, remain in effect, the AP reported Wednesday.\nThat capitulation introduces more unknowns: How long will the pause last? What tariffs remain when it ends? What\u2019s the likelihood of recession now?\n\u201cI think it re-emphasizes that we\u2019re in an environment of uncertainty,\u201d Sam Chandan, director of NYU Stern\u2019s Chen Institute for Global Real Estate Finance said.\n\u201cIt will be some time before we find ourselves in an environment that we would describe as stable, again,\u201d he added.\nThat means mortgage rates are still likely to rise, pushing rents higher.\nThe city\u2019s renters will only catch a break if things get really ugly. That is: \u201cIf Trump\u2019s tariffs drive a recession, which means a lot of job loss,\u201d Miller said.\nHigher unemployment means fewer New Yorkers can afford their $4,500 apartments. If those renters then leave the city, their exodus frees up supply, which could push down rents or at least soften the pace of gains.\nBut that\u2019s one potential long view. In the near-term, homebuyers are likely to freeze in wait and see mode, stoking rent growth as peak leasing season is just heating up.\n",

        "content": "Here\u2019s an idea: Why don\u2019t we build apartments?\nThis was a question Vornado CEO Steve Roth posed in his annual letter to shareholders this week.\nIn the letter, he enumerates the benefits of building apartments compared to \u201coffice buildings aka capital hogs.\u201d He says that developing an apartment building of, say, 500,000 square feet would cost $400 million less than an office property of the same size. Apartment buildings also don\u2019t require a developer to court prospective anchor tenants to land financing.\n\u201cSo why aren\u2019t we building some apartments? A very good question.\u201d\nI\u2019m sure that a number of developers and landlords could chime in with answers. In fact, analysts with Piper Sandler quibbled with part of Roth\u2019s rosy outlook for apartments, noting that \u201ccosts and regulatory requirements are onerous.\u201d In a report released late Wednesday, the analysts pointed to construction wage requirements that kick in for 485x projects with more than 99 units.\nRoth himself has repeatedly raised the alarm about construction headwinds. In February, he said ground-up construction remains challenging given stubbornly high interest rates and the lack of aggressive capital.\nBut the chin-stroking question Roth posed isn\u2019t coming out of nowhere: Since at least 2023, Roth has dropped hints about building housing in the Penn District. In May 2023, Roth indicated that, yes, the market was abominable for ground-up development, but Vornado would likely begin with an apartment building in the Penn District when the time was right.\nIn his letter, he mentions a site at 34th Street and Eighth Avenue, where Vornado is planning to begin construction of a rental property \u201cshortly.\u201d\nHe has also repeatedly indicated that Vornado is considering including housing as part of the Penn 15 development.\nThe letter also discusses the prospect of Vornado selling its office buildings. As Roth says, \u201cthere are no sacred cows in our portfolio.\u201d H/T to\nCrain\u2019s\nfor first reporting on the letter.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nA bill to expand the low-income housing tax credit program was\nre-introduced\nin the U.S. House of Representatives this week. The bill, first introduced in 2016, has 117 bipartisan co-sponsors. Will it get passed this year? How are you thinking about these potential changes in terms of broader financing challenges? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: A state\nbill\nthat would restrict ground-lease rent increases and grant co-op shareholders the right to renew the lease was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee this week (in a very close vote).\n\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 The City Planning Commission on Wednesday approved zoning changes needed for Related Companies and Wynn Resorts\u2019 casino proposal. The vote means the proposal now heads to the City Council.\n\u2014 The Charter Revision Commission convened by the mayor was initially focused on housing and land use issues but is now expanding to cover other topics,\nCity &amp; State reports\n. The commission will consider a number of election reform-related proposals. Good-government group Citizens Union, according to Gothamist, submitted testimony to the commission calling for the creation of a \u201cspecial removal election\u201d that allows voters to decide whether a mayor should be removed from office due to misconduct.\n\u2014 NJ Transit is launching a new initiative to renovate housing near Newark Penn Station for homeless individuals,\nGothamist reports\n. The agency and its partners plan to spend $6 million to renovate 200 apartments near the station to serve as transitional housing. The agency also plans to build a drop-in center for people to rest or take a shower. \u201cInstead of washing up in Penn Station\u2019s bathroom, they get to go up the street and take a shower and wash their clothes and get services and treatment not too far from here,\u201d Newark Mayor Ras Baraka said.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe priciest residential sale Wednesday was\n$12.6 million\nfor a 4,100-square-foot condo unit at 140 Franklin Street in Tribeca. Danny Davis and Lisa Balbuena of\nThe Corcoran Group had the listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe most expensive commercial closing of the day was\n$7.25 million\nfor a 1,700-square-foot mixed-use building at 218 East Ninth Street in the East Village. The Toraji Corporation purchased the property from an entity tied to Derby Copeland Capital.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$27.5 million\nfor a 9,000-square-foot townhouse at 40 East 73rd Street in Lenox Hill. Adam Modlin and Andrew Nierenberg have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building application filed was for an 83,318-square-foot, 15-story, 99-unit mixed-use project at 277 North Eighth Street in Williamsburg. Kao Hwa Lee Architects filed the permit on behalf of David Grunfeld.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "A federal judge may have overstepped his bounds in ordering the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to build housing at its West Los Angeles campus.\nThat was suggested by a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard multiple appeals this week in a class-action case involving the 388-acre West L.A. VA Campus at 11301 Wilshire Boulevard,\nthe Los Angeles Times reported\n.\nThe judge trio, while seeming to agree with a claim that the VA had failed in its duty to local veterans, raised concerns that a trial judge may have\nexceeded his authority\nwith a sweeping order requiring the agency to build more homes.\nThe appellate case centers on a decision by U.S. District Court Judge David O. Carter invalidating four leases of VA land to University of California, Los Angeles, and a K-12 school, while issuing an injunction ordering the agency to\nbuild thousands of homes\nfor disabled veterans.\nAfter a trial last year, Carter ordered the VA to immediately build 100 temporary housing units on campus parking lots and plan to add more temporary housing and 1,800 units of permanent housing within six years.\nThe 9th Circuit\nstayed that order\nafter the\ngovernment appealed\nand\nscheduled it for an expedited hearing\n. Its appeal was joined by UCLA, the Brentwood School and oil producer Bridgeland Resources.\n\u201cWhen you look at things that have occurred on this property, I struggle with how some of the things the VA did benefited veterans at all,\u201d presiding Judge Consuelo M. Callahan said early in the proceeding.\n\u201cI guess the remedies here are what caused me concern, the reach of what Judge Carter [ordered].\u201d\nDepartment of Justice appellate attorney Daniel Winik raised numerous objections to Carter\u2019s interpretation of federal regulations, the rules for declaring a class and the nature of a trust.\n\n\u201cWe believe Judge Carter erred in effectively taking over control of the WLA campus,\u201d he told the court.\nCallahan boiled down the broad issues of the case: the veterans contention that the 1888 gift of the land to the federal government created a charitable trust and that the VA had failed to live up to it; and arguments that Carter may have gone too far in assuming control over the land.\nLooking at the original deed, she said, she had no doubt the property was given for the benefit of the veterans and that the VA had not lived up to that trust.\nBut she worried that Carter\u2019s ruling \u201cmay be coloring outside the lines and may be too broad.\u201d\n\u201cIf we leave everything in place, what is Judge Carter going to be doing for the next six years?\u201d Callahan asked the veterans attorney, Mark Rosenbaum.\n\u201cWell, I think he is going to be busy,\u201d Rosenbaum said. He said the judge would collaborate with VA officials.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s bothering me, that he is running the VA,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cIn collaboration, but is he the final say in that? \u2026 if you get to be the ultimate decision maker, you\u2019re running it. He\u2019s still the king here, or the superintendent.\u201d\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

Sublease availability decreased by 70 basis points to 1.8 percent in the first quarter, the lowest level recorded since the onset of the pandemic.\nMajor deals included Fortune Brands\u2019 372,000-square-foot lease at 1-2 Takeda Way in Deerfiel;, a 150,000-square-foot lease by payroll services company ADP, at 1299 Zurich Way in Schaumburg; and biotech company Vantive\u2019s 120,000-square-foot lease at an office complex known as Corporate 500 in Deerfield.\nBut even with the promising jump in activity, the suburban market\u2019s vacancy rate remains high. It closed out the first quarter at 25.7 percent.\n\nThe vacancy rate is skewed by the widening gap between Class A, B and C properties, Colliers broker Jon Connor said.

        "content": "Is the third time the charm for a long-simmering redevelopment in the Richmond District?\nAfter over 20 years of failed plans to turn the dilapidated Alexandria Theater on Geary into everything from a restaurant and condominium development to a swimming pool and offices, developer TimeSpace Group recently received San Francisco Planning Commission approval for a zoning variance to build 75 housing units up to 85 feet high, more than double the current height allowance of 40 feet.\nSan Francisco Supervisor Connie Chan, who represents Richmond, sponsored the special-use district for the former movie theater late last year, as well as a modified version in March. She has been working on a housing plan with the developers\nsince at least 2023\n. The recently approved version allows for increased density but requires that the theater\u2019s historic blade sign and marquee, as well as internal murals and original 1920s-era sunburst chandelier, be retained.\nChan did not reply to a request for comment, but said during the commission meeting on April 3 that the most recent approved plan to turn the long-empty theater into a swimming pool with classrooms and office space above ended during the pandemic when it seemed, \u201cat that time, were we going to have indoor swimming pools ever again?\u201d\nThe current plan took its inspiration from the former Coronet Theater, also on Geary, which is now senior housing, she said at the hearing. The Alexandria project would be 12 percent affordable housing, with 85 percent of the units having two or three bedrooms. Chan said the theater would become sorely needed family housing, while keeping a community-facing commercial space and preserving historic aspects of the 1920s-era Egyptian Revival-style theater on the ground floor.\nYorke Lee, who founded the Saratoga-based Time Space Group and has owned the Alexandria since 2014, did not reply to a request for comment. The group has not submitted detailed plans but had initial massing diagrams of the eight-story building at the hearing. It has three years to get a building permit after the zoning change is approved.\nNick Cola, an attorney for the developer, said at the hearing that the special use district \u201ccreates a pathway for us to reactivate the space.\u201d A \u201cclubhouse-type space\u201d on the ground floor would include the preserved murals, while the former ticket box would be turned into retail, architect Irving Gonzales said at the hearing.\nThe commission unanimously approved the zoning carve-out for the project after the recommendation of planning staff, which said the 80-foot height was \u201cappropriate\u201d given the width of Geary Boulevard, and consistent with proposed heights in the\nupcoming city rezoning plan\n. The proposed unit mix and reduced inclusionary rate would make the development \u201cmore feasible,\u201d said the project\u2019s principal city planner, Tina Tam, while prioritizing family-sized units and ensuring that \u201cthis part of Geary Boulevard\u2019s past will be preserved for future generations.\u201d\n\nThough some neighbors sent letters of complaint to the commission about the new height and lack of parking before the meeting, no one spoke against the project at the hearing. Preservationist Woody LaBounty told the commission that he had been following the various proposed projects over the 21 years since the theater, which he called a \u201cplacemaker for the Central Richmond,\u201d closed in 2004.\n\u201cI just implore them to get moving on this,\u201d he said of the development team. \u201cSo that the neighborhood can have the housing and the beautiful, beautiful Alexandria Theater building back to enjoy for future generations.\u201d\nPlanning Commissioner Sean McGarry, who lives in the district, was among the commissioners who seconded the concerns that time was of the essence.\n\u201cAnything that can be done for the Alexandria Theater should have been done yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s been no maintenance on this building for the last 20 years. It\u2019s very, very sad.\u201d\nAs a member of the Carpenters Union Local 22, McGarry wanted to know if union labor would be mandatory on the project. Chan said the city attorney had advised that it could be strongly encouraged, but not mandated.\nThe next step is for the zoning change to go to the Land Use Committee and then the full Board of Supervisors. Dates for those hearings were not yet available, according to Tam. If it is approved by the full board, it would only return to planning for informational updates, and would not require any further approvals.\n",

        "content": "A coalition of international developers have invoked the state builder\u2019s remedy to push through plans to build more than 1,000 affordable homes atop a former limestone quarry in Pacifica.\nThe owners of the Rockaway Quarry have filed plans to build 1,021 homes west of the Pacific Coast Highway and Reina del Mar Avenue,\nthe San Francisco Business Times reported\n.\nThe 86-acre abandoned quarry is owned by Preserve at Pacifica, a limited liability company not listed in state business records, and Michigan-based Paul Heule, who said the city has been battling housing at the site for three decades.\nThe project, dubbed Coastal Crest Residences, is backed by the Paul Heule-owned\nEenhoorn\n, based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Zeist, a multifamily developer based in the Netherlands.\nPlans call for workforce housing, or affordable homes geared toward middle-class families that include cops, firefighters and teachers, and would comprise 80 percent of the homes. Another 20 percent would be set aside for low-income households.\nThe developers didn\u2019t say what kinds of homes they planned to build, such as condominiums or apartments. A cost and timeline for the project were not disclosed.\n\u201cWe are in a housing crisis, so this project feels long overdue,\u201d Heule told the Business Times.\nThe builder\u2019s remedy, a decades-old loophole in state housing law, allows developers to bypass local zoning rules in cities and counties that failed to certify their state housing plans, provided they include 20 percent affordable housing.\n\nThe coastal city of Pacifica must plan to build 1,892 homes by 2031. The deadline to have certified its state-mandated housing element was Jan. 31, 2023 \u2014 more than 26 months ago. The gap has opened the door to builder\u2019s remedy applications.\nPacifica, in San Mateo County, has a population of 36,500, with a typical home value of $1.2 million, and median monthly rent of $3,100.\nThe project is part of a broad plan to\naddress a housing shortage in San Mateo County\n. In March, county officials discussed plans to develop affordable housing on up to a dozen properties from South San Francisco to Redwood City, according to the Business Times.\nHeule has for years tried to redevelop the Rockaway Quarry, between Vallemar and Rockaway Beach.\nIn 2016, he\npitched a plan\nto build 200 apartments, plus a 200-room hotel, offices, shops and restaurants and a concert amphitheater, which was rejected by voters. Pacifica voters previously turned down plans to build homes on the site in 2001 and 2006.\nLast month, the State Mining and Geology Board\nrejected an appeal\nby Heule of a decision by the Pacifica City Council to reject development plans for the Rockaway Quarry site, according to Coastside News.\nIn November, the city denied the permits for the project, which would fill the 200-year-old quarry with hundreds of thousands of cubic yards of dirt.\n\u2014\nDana Bartholomew\n",

        "content": "David Werner continues his epic New York buying spree.\nThe investor is in contract to buy the office building at 5 Hanover Square in the Financial District from CIM Group, sources told\nThe Real Deal\n. The contract price is somewhere between $50 million and $60 million.\nThat\u2019s about half the $104 million Los Angeles-based CIM paid for the 1960s-era office building more than a decade ago.\nWerner has spent the last few years buying up older office buildings in the Financial District and Midtown at deep discounts, many of which he\u2019s converting into apartments. The 25-story, roughly 340,000-square-foot 5 Hanover is about 50 percent vacant and would most likely be a partial conversion.\nRepresentatives for Werner and CIM Group did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A CBRE team led by Doug Middleton and Jack Stillwagon brokered the deal. The brokers declined to comment.\nCIM \u2014 led by founders Shaul Kuba, Richard Ressler and Avi Shemesh \u2014 bought 5 Hanover in 2013 from Christopher Schlank and Nicholas Bienstock\u2019s Savanna, which had picked up the building three years earlier when previous owner Kent Swig\nsurrendered\nthe property after defaulting on his mortgage. The company replaced the building\u2019s windows, updated the lobby and put in new elevator cabs. In 2022, it signed the independent IDEAL School of Manhattan to 63,000 square feet.\nThe Financial District office market, however, has struggled \u2014 particularly since the pandemic. The Downtown availability rate is north of 20% as of the first quarter, according to CBRE.\n\nIt seems not a week goes by without Werner making news. Earlier this week, he and partner Nathan Berman of Metro Loft Management secured a\n$90 million\nloan from Ran Eliasaf\u2019s Northwind Group for their residential conversion of the office building at 675 Third Avenue.\nWerner and Berman recently purchased the building from the Durst Organization for more than $100 million.\nWerner is also flipping the office portion of the nearby 300 East 42nd Street, which he went into contract to buy earlier this year for $52 million.\nThe notoriously press-shy investor is known for being active when values are low and bargains are to be had. He was one of the biggest buyers in 2014 and once again started snapping up discounted office buildings in 2022.\nHis deals include 100 Wall Street, which he bought last year with Lloyd Goldman\u2019s BLDG for\n$115 million\n(a deep discount to the $270 million the seller Barings paid in 2015) and 40 Fulton Street, which he bought in 2022 for\n$101 million\n. Seller Vornado Realty Trust had been eyeing at least\n$130 million\nfor the property.\nIn Chicago, Werner in January teamed up with 601W to buy the distressed office building at 303 East Wacker for $63 million. The 30-story building previously sold for $182 million in 2018.\nWerner and Berman also have plans to convert the former Pfizer headquarters in Midtown into 1,600 apartments, which would make it the largest office-to-resi conversion ever.\n",

        "content": "Shlomi Bagdadi was in the middle of negotiating a large retail lease for a global brand in New York City when President Trump announced expansive new tariffs last week. The client suddenly\nput the deal on ice\n, citing concerns about the\ncost of a large buildout\n.\n\u201cThey were worried about what\u2019s going to be the construction bill,\u201d said Tri State Commercial Realty\u2019s Bagdadi. \u201cThey\u2019re at the finishing stages and they wanted to take a pause to gather their thoughts and see how they wanted to move forward.\u201d\nRetail and office tenants across the New York City market are putting lease plans on pause \u2014 or scrapping them altogether \u2014 as they wait for more clarity on President Trump\u2019s tariffs, multiple commercial brokers said. Concerns about inflation, the cost of building materials and high interest rates are shaking up the leasing market, which has been riding\na wave of good news\nin both the retail and office sectors over the last several quarters.\nManhattan office leasing volume reached 12.2 million square feet in the first quarter of this year, the most since the fourth quarter of 2019, according to Savills. On the retail side, the first quarter\u2019s rolling four-quarter leasing volume, which measures volume over the last 12 months, saw 14 percent year-over-year growth, per CBRE.\nThat momentum could grind to a halt given the last week\u2019s headlines.\n\u201cThe overwhelming theme that I was hearing from tenants, big decision-makers, especially those that are based outside of America, was \u2018we\u2019re putting things on hold just to see how things shake out,\u2019\u201d said Brandon Singer of Retail by MONA.\nSinger had a Hong Kong-based retail client put a lease deal on pause during a phone call late Sunday.\n\u201cWe were supposed to get on the call to talk about deal terms on a deal, and they basically said, \u2018We\u2019re not doing it until this is all figured out,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been a lot of hesitancy to take it across the finish line over the past week, or maybe even longer than that, since the talk of tariffs came into play.\u201d\nLast week, President Trump unveiled a sweeping tariff plan that included taxes on some countries exceeding 50 percent. The market swiftly responded, with the S&amp;P dropping nearly 14 percent between last Thursday and Wednesday morning. On Wednesday afternoon, however, Trump announced a\n90-day pause\non many of the higher reciprocal tariffs that hit dozens of trade partners earlier in the day while raising duties on China to 125 percent. Wall Street quickly rebounded.\nReal estate industry players, however, wondered whether the tariff whiplash would start to thaw the frozen leasing market or further fuel the uncertainty.\n\n\u201cThis morning, it looked like the market was on the verge of a complete collapse, and this afternoon, the market\u2019s back up again. So I definitely think there\u2019s a sense of \u2018give it a few days to play out,\u2019\u201d said Vasi Yiannoulis-Riva of the law firm Polsinelli. \u201cI don\u2019t think people are rushing to sign lease deals at the moment.\u201d\nYiannoulis-Riva, who works on retail and office lease deals, said retail businesses are more vulnerable to tariffs in the short term because they either have to absorb the costs themselves or pass them down to consumers, who then modify their spending habits. The office market is less acute, though still tied to broader economic conditions.\n\u201cIf the global economy tanks, that is going to have a big impact on the office market, and it will cause companies to maybe hit the pause button on taking more office space,\u201d she said.\nThat\u2019s already happening with some office tenants. Savills broker Gabe Marans posted on LinkedIn Wednesday about a client who pulled out of a lease deal due to tariffs.\n\u201cThe trade war has officially reached real estate,\u201d he posted.\nRuth Colp-Haber of Wharton Property Advisors said her nonprofit clients are halting plans as they digest both the tariffs and potential cuts to their funding by the Department of Government Efficiency.\nBut as leases expire and tenants have to pull the trigger, tariffs could push them toward turn-key spaces, widening the gap between prime Class A office properties and everything else, she said.\n\u201cThe buildings that have already modernized and put the money in and have turn-key, prebuilt space they can lease, no question, are going to do better,\u201d Colp-Haber said. \u201cBut for those that need work, the work has become so complicated and costly.\u201d\nA few brokers said they have not yet noticed a shift in the market. And tenants are inking deals, despite tariff concerns.\n\u201cWe just signed a lease for a nail salon down in Tribeca and they were concerned because a lot of the equipment and supplies were coming from overseas \u2014 and they almost didn\u2019t do it because of that,\u201d said James Famularo, who heads the retail leasing division at Meridian. \u201cThen they changed direction and they decided to go ahead with the lease.\u201d\n",
