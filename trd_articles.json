        "content": "A full city block in Santa Monica is slated for transformation into an eight-story residential building.\nTrammell Crow Company has\nproposed\nreplacing an existing office complex at 2716 Ocean Park Boulevard in Santa Monica with 456 residential units above ground-floor retail, Los Angeles YIMBY reported.\nThe eight-story building would include 456 total units in studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom layouts. Of the 456 units, 46 would be designated for rent at below-market rates, allowing developer Trammell Crow to take advantage of density bonus incentives allowing a taller structure with more units than zoning rules would typically allow. The ground floor would have 6,200 square feet of commercial space.\nParking for 668 vehicles would be included on site. Amenities planned for the residential complex north of\nSanta Monica Airport\ninclude a fitness center, lounge spaces, outdoor courtyards and roof decks.\nThe project is being designed by AC Martin. Renderings for the project indicate some residences would have recessed balconies and roof decks integrated into residences on the upper levels.\nUnder the City of Santa Monica\u2019s housing element, officials must plan for 8,874 new housing units by 2029; of those, 69 percent must be at various affordable income levels. To meet that goal, the city has been approving developers\u2019 affordable housing plans or looking to sell land to willing builders who vow to construct affordable units. Last year, the city sought developers to build affordable housing on three city-owned properties as the city works to comply with California\u2019s Surplus Land Act.\nIn September, the city\nadvanced an eight-story residential project\nat 1907-1933 Wilshire Boulevard set to contain 260 units, including 26 set aside for affordable housing. The developer for that project is U.S. 1931 Wilshire Owner LLC, linked by address in state business records to\nCypress Equity Investments\n. Cypress is also looking to\nreplace a former Honda dealership\nat 1801 and 1819 Santa Monica Boulevard with a 288-unit apartment complex.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Unsheathe your\nauction\npaddles \u2014 a bidding tourney will decide the next owner of a siegeworthy estate near Houston.\nNathan Milner, a video game streamer known on YouTube as Unspeakable, is auctioning his realm in\nMagnolia\n, a suburb north of Houston. On almost 11 acres, the 7,200-square-foot home at 9011 Breckenridge Drive features five bedrooms, eight bathrooms, an outdoor kitchen and a game room, all guarded by a moat, according to marketing materials.\nAmenities include a basketball court and a workshop that can accommodate six vehicles. The property has an agricultural use exemption, a property tax advantage that also permits the owner to keep livestock on the land, Montgomery County records show.\nJLA Realty agent Jasmin Lye has the property listed for $3.5 million, amounting to about $500 per square foot. The property first listed in September for $3.8 million; the seller lowered the price in November, according to Zillow.\nSotheby\u2019s\nConcierge Auctions\nis handling the auction process. The company expects bids to start between $1 million and $2 million, according to marketing materials.\nConcierge will hold a preview event at the site on Feb. 1. Bidding opens on Feb. 12 and closes on Feb. 25.\nMilner\u2019s channel has over 19 million subscribers on YouTube. In one of his most-watched videos, published in August, Milner turns the property into a water park. The water slides have since been removed.\nHe purchased the property in 2020 through his company, Unspeakable Media LLC, for an undisclosed price, according to public records.\nAn auction resulted in Houston\u2019s most expensive sale of December. A home at 3102 Noble Lakes Lane that was previously owned by Nick Van Exel and once appeared on MTV\u2019s \u201cCribs\u201d\nasked $9.9 million before it went to auction\n. The winning bid hasn\u2019t been disclosed.\nConcierge is also handling the auction of manufacturing mogul\nChaz Neely\u2019s waterfront estate in Belton\n. Unlike Milner\u2019s property, the 13-acre Belton estate will undergo a live auction.\n",

        "content": "A proposed Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center outside Dallas is starting to look less hypothetical and more like a very real industrial real estate move with possible civic consequences.\nThe Washington Post first reported in December that ICE was planning a roughly 1-million-square-foot detention center in Hutchins \u2014 a small town in Dallas County southeast of Dallas \u2014 capable of holding up to 9,500 people, more than 10 times the capacity of the nearest ICE facility in Prairieland. The plan immediately rattled the city of fewer than 8,000 residents, whose mayor said publicly he did not want the project and noted only one warehouse in town is large enough to fit the bill, D Magazine\nreported\n.\nUntil now, neither\nICE\nnor any media outlet had identified a specific site or owner. But local clergy groups and community leaders say the location is an open secret.\nOn Friday, members of the Clergy League for Emergency Action and Response gathered in Dallas to protest the proposed center, saying ICE officials had privately confirmed the location to some members. The\nfacility\n, they said, is a 1-million-square-foot warehouse at 950 North I-45, next to the Hutchins State Jail, the outlet reported. A Majestic Realty listing for the address shows a building of just over 1 million square feet, aligning with earlier descriptions. The Dallas Central Appraisal District values the property at $80.1 million.\nPublic records list the owner as PS Hutchins Phase Two, a Delaware entity registered through an agent. Calls to the property listing went to the voicemail of a\nMajestic Realty\nsenior vice president. A document from the project\u2019s builder shows the warehouse was originally designed for Amazon, echoing Mayor Mario Vasquez\u2019s description of the only viable site in town.\nClergy members said ICE already conducted a site visit and\npurchased the building\nrather than leasing it, though the agency has not confirmed a transaction or even acknowledged a specific address. A title commitment dated last week for the property was shared with reporters, adding fuel to the speculation.\nThe real estate implications extend beyond the building itself. Bond documents from Hutchins show the property is among the city\u2019s top 10 taxpayers, accounting for about 3.8 percent of its tax base and generating roughly $1.8 million a year, according to the outlet. If ICE owns the facility, that revenue could disappear, complicating the city\u2019s ability to service debt. Infrastructure is another concern. Local leaders warn Hutchins lacks the water and sewer capacity to support what would effectively double its population overnight.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A hefty tax bill is coming due for Jeff Winick as his fall from the perch of his brokerage firm continues.\nA bankruptcy judge ordered the Winick Realty Group founder to pay approximately $9 million to the Internal Revenue Service for income tax he failed to pay between 2012 and 2016, Bisnow\nreported\n. The judge declared Winick\u2019s tax filings for those years an \u201coutright fabrication,\u201d though he was credited for paying $2 million in taxes from 2014 to 2020.\nThe bankruptcy judge\u2019s decision was reported first by\nBloomberg Law\n.\nThe ruling was years in the making. The IRS sued Winick in 2020, shortly after he filed for bankruptcy claiming $10 million in liabilities against only $500,000 in assets. The IRS alleged Winick was living it up and fraudulently transferring assets while ducking his income tax responsibilities.\nIn his defense, Winick pointed towards a gambling addiction, which cost him more than $12 million in the years prior to his bankruptcy. He also claimed he planned to pay his taxes with big business or gambling gains that failed to materialize.\nThe judge balked at his argument, pointing to years where Winick managed to gamble, pay taxes and still have the money for international trips, exorbitant rentals and family shopping sprees.\nWinick also allegedly transferred business and property shares to his daughter for no consideration, which the IRS alleged was likely a method to dodge taxes.\nWinick ultimately was\nforced to sell\na stake in his brokerage several years ago. Steven Baker, now chief executive officer, teamed up with colleagues Louis Eisinger and Lee Block to\npurchase a majority stake\nin the company in 2021.\nThe insiders scored a 63 percent stake after being selected as stalking horse bidders, a controversial proceeding due to the alleged involvement of Winick\u2019s daughter in the bid.\nLast year, Winick Realty Group\nrebranded\nas RTL, a name designed to reflect a focus on the retail industry. Winick remains an active dealmaker and has been listed as an exclusive agent on many of the brokerage\u2019s listings, continuing with RTL as an associate broker.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A 10-acre-plus waterfront resort and marina in the Florida Keys that once hosted actor Paul Newman and gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson is listed for sale for $45 million,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nSugarloaf Lodge &amp; Marina, near mile marker 17, consists of 31 hotel rooms and commercial space. The site at 17001 Overseas Highway comes with development rights to rebuild 24 hotel keys lost in Hurricane Wilma in 2005, according to listing broker Lisa Swanson.\nSwanson, of The Agency Florida Keys, is listing the property with Jamie Bederak, of The Agency Miami.\nThe asking price amounts to $1.45 million per hotel key.\nSugarloaf Lodge was built in the late 1950s by the Pennsylvania strip mining company that dredged and developed much of Sugarloaf Key. Additions were built in the 1960s. In 1973, husband-and-wife Lloyd and Miriam Good bought the property and moved to Sugarloaf Key to run the resort with their four children.\nThe property is now owned by entity Miriam BG, led by John Good and Caren Ward, children of the late Lloyd and Miriam Good. The entity also is led by Jessica Duncan Wex and Katchen Elizabeth Duncan, John Good\u2019s nieces.\nSugarloaf spans nearly 10.6 acres and includes a 12,700-square-foot hotel and a 5,300-square-foot restaurant leased to South of the Seven, plus a tiki bar and events venue. It includes office space, some of it leased to kayak and boat rental firms and a solar energy company, and it also has an apartment, marinas, a pool and tennis courts, according to Swanson and John Good.\nThe owners have preserved much of the property\u2019s original look, including Mid-Century Modern decor in the hotel rooms.\nThe property can be entirely redeveloped, though it would mean bigger setbacks from the bay, especially for the restaurant that now juts into the water atop stilts, due to changes in construction regulations. The development potential for 24 hotel keys is legally vested with the property.\nMonroe County caps heights to 38 feet, with officials considering legislation to increase this to 42 feet for residential uses.\nGood, who grew up on the property and hosted the 5 p.m. daily dolphins shows, recalled some of its history.\nDolly, a \u201cvery smart\u201d dolphin that escaped the U.S. Navy was a common visitor when the Good family arrived at Sugarloaf Lodge. The Goods removed any nets keeping her within the bay, and Dolly eventually swam away, as she wasn\u2019t too keen on doing the shows, Good said.\nJacques Cousteau had studied Dolly for her intelligence and featured her in one of his books. Sugar, the other bottlenose dolphin there, enjoyed performing, sticking around until her death in 1997, Good said.\nNewman was fun to talk with, Good said, and imparted some insight on his alma mater Kenyon College, where Good was headed at the time. Thompson \u201cwas kind of part of our family for a couple of years,\u201d Good said. A pig prank involving Thomson and Lloyd Good made it into Thomspon\u2019s \u201cSongs of the Doomed.\u201d\n\u201cCrazy times,\u201d John Good said. \u201cIt was the \u201970s and \u201980s \u2026 a lot of characters.\u201d\nThe Florida Keys are quieter than bustling Miami to the north, though the Keys also attracted some investment during South Florida\u2019s commercial and residential real estate boom of recent years.\nIn Islamorada, Barstool Sports owner Dave Portnoy bought the 1.7-acre waterfront mansion at 76180 Overseas Highway for\n$27.8 million\nin October.\nAlso in Islamorada, Frisbie Group sold the Islands of Islamorada resort consisting of 22 villas and an eight-key hotel for\n$72 million\nin 2024. Buyer Wills Companies launched\nsales\nof the villas last year.\nIn 2023, The Ardid family\u2019s Brickell-based Key International paid more than\n$37.6 million\nfor the 100-key Perry Hotel at 7001 Shrimp Road in Key West, and Miami-based Integra Investments paid about $29.7 million for the adjacent 288-slip, 35-acre Perry Marina at 7005 Shrimp Road.\n",

        "content": "Perot Jain is officially moving into Dallas\u2019 most rarefied office address \u2014 at Harlan Crow\u2019s Old Parkland campus.\nThe venture capital firm co-founded by Ross Perot Jr. and Anurag Jain opened a 4,200-square-foot office in Providence Hall, part of the newly built Old Parkland East campus, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The move places the firm inside the latest expansion of the historic\nOld Parkland\ncomplex, a\nJeffersonian-style enclave\nthat has become home to some of North Texas\u2019 wealthiest family offices, law firms, private equity shops and foundations.\nPerot Jain will consolidate its five-person team in the new space, while maintaining space at\nHillwood\nand the Perot Companies\u2019 Turtle Creek headquarters. The office marks a step forward for the firm, which launched in 2014 and has quietly built a portfolio of roughly 70 companies across logistics, mobility, industrial, defense and sports.\nThe deal comes as Crow Holdings continues to fill out Old Parkland East, a three-building expansion that added about 285,000 square feet to the campus, according to the publication. Bill Brokaw of Hillwood Urban represented Perot Jain in lease talks, while HPI Real Estate Services\u2019 Ben Cuzen handled the deal for Old Parkland.\nPerot Jain partner Aaron Pierce told the outlet that the draw was less about square footage than proximity. Old Parkland\u2019s tight-knit tenant roster has long functioned as an informal deal marketplace, where chance hallway conversations often lead to co-investments. Pierce previously worked on campus before joining Perot Jain and said the collaborative culture remains a differentiator.\nJain sold a majority stake in Access Healthcare to New Mountain Capital in January 2025 in a deal Bloomberg reported to be valued at $2 billion. That firm was later rolled into Smarter Technologies in a reported $6 billion combination, freeing Jain to focus more heavily on venture investing and his family office, which will also operate out of the\nOld Parkland\nspace.\nPerot Jain\u2019s focus is often on early-stage companies generating less than $1 million to a few million dollars in revenue. Its bets range from AI and cyber-defense firm Rilian to Casimir, a startup working on next-generation power technology, along with a stake in the Texas Super Kings cricket team, according to the Business Journal.\nThe move also highlights Old Parkland\u2019s continued appeal as Dallas\u2019 unofficial capital of private capital. While many office landlords are still fighting vacancies, the campus has leaned into exclusivity, curated tenancy and expansion.\nPierce, who also chairs nonprofit Venture Dallas, told the outlet that he sees the firm\u2019s new home as aligned with a broader regional push. Dallas-Fort Worth companies attracted more than $2 billion in venture funding across 222 deals in 2025, up sharply from the prior year, according to PitchBook-NVCA data.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Boca Raton-based Pebb Enterprises is led by Todd Rosenberg and New York-based Lane Capital is led by Alan Leavitt.\nTony Arellano and Devlin Marinoff with Dwntwn Realty Advisors brokered the transaction, representing the buyer and the seller,\nDesign District Development Partners\n, an entity managed by Benjamin Norton in Sarasota.\nThe previous sale price is not listed in records, but Design District Development Partners obtained a $24.3 million construction loan in 2016. Design 41 was completed two years later, records show.\nThe developer secured a\n$30 million\nbridge loan in 2018 that was increased by $11 million three years later, according to mortgage documents. It obtained a separate $4.3 million loan in 2024.\nSutton and his partners were looking initially to recapitalize the building but pivoted to buying it outright, Arellano said.The loans came due during the sale process, he added.\n\u201cWe had cascading loan maturities and challenging dynamics with the lenders,\u201d Arellano said. \u201cBut we got the deal done.\u201d\nThe building\u2019s office tenants include architecture firm Foster + Partners and the Miami office for David Edelstein\u2019s New York-based\nTriCap\n. Retail tenants on the ground floor, such as perfume shop Bond No. 9 NY and bedding store H\u00e4stens, are paying monthly rents of $1,526 a square foot, the release states. Dwntwn handles leasing.\nThe Design District is among the top retail destinations, and among the most expensive, in the U.S. Rents in the neighborhood skyrocketed by more than 200 percent, during a five year period ending in 2024, to an average of $500 per square foot, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield.\nLast month, Craig Robins\u2019 Dacra, L Catterton Real Estate and Brookfield added\n$100 million\nto a $250 million loan secured by six retail properties in the Design District.",

        "content": "Developer and Brea native Dwight Manley has closed his purchase of a business park in Brea, clearing the way for the Orange County city\u2019s first\nCostco\nlocation.\nHines\noffloaded\nthe Beckman Coulter Campus at 200 South Kraemer Street in Brea for $140 million, the Orange County Business Journal reported. Hines previously acquired the five-building office and industrial complex in 2018 for $115 million. The property totals 576,234 square feet across nearly 34 acres.\nLast month, Brea city leaders agreed to a 50-year sales tax rebate with Dwight Manley if he executes a lease with Costco as officials\nhoped\nto bring the big-box store to the city, the Los Angeles Times reported. The Brea City Council voted to give Manley a year to bring Costco to Brea once his acquisition of the 34-acre property was complete.\nUnder the agreement, Manley will receive a 100 percent rebate of the sales tax revenue generated by a future Costco location in the first two years. Over the course of the 50-year deal, the city would collect 42.5 percent of the sales tax. The deal works out to approximately $50 million in sales tax for the city and $83.5 million reimbursed to Manley. \u201cThis is the skinniest developer deal I\u2019ve ever heard of,\u201d Manley told the city council of the agreement at the time.\n\u201cCostco does not enter into agreements with cities,\u201d Manley said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the property owner. They\u2019ve had property owners do this in many instances where cities participated because they wanted a Costco.\u201d\nWhile Manley was negotiating with Hines, other bidders were interested in purchasing the site for other purposes, including an Amazon warehouse or high-density housing.\nCostco is in the process of growing its presence in Orange County.\nLast year, the wholesaler\nacquired two sites\nin Mission Viejo and Lake Forest in two separate deals to build new Costco locations. In Mission Viejo, Costco bought a former\nBed Bath &amp; Beyond\nat 25732 El Paseo for $14.4 million with plans to tear down the building and build a new fueling station with 40 pumps spanning more than 17,000 square feet next to I-405. In\nLake Forest\n\u2019s Foothill Ranch neighborhood, Costco picked up the defunct Regal Cinema at Foothill Ranch Towne Center for $12.5 million and is looking to replace it with a 160,811-square-foot store.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Eli Karp is suing the lender and appraiser of his foreclosed Hello Lenox apartment building, alleging they intentionally overvalued the Brooklyn property.\nKarp is accusing a Greystone affiliate and real estate valuation firm BBG of engineering a \u201cloan-to-own\u201d scheme that he says cost him his flagship property, per a lawsuit filed Monday in New York State Supreme Court. Karp alleges that Greystone, led by founder and CEO Stephen Rosenberg, conspired with BBG to dramatically inflate the value of his newly-built apartment complex at 271 Lenox Road in East Flatbush.\nThe inflated valuation, the suit claims, was used to lure Karp into a $34.5 million bridge loan that ultimately set the stage for a foreclosure. According to the complaint, BBG appraisers valued the 55-unit property at $46.2 million in 2019, an appraisal Greystone allegedly commissioned and paid for. Relying on that figure, Karp personally guaranteed the loan, which was intended to refinance construction debt and buy him time to sell the building, the suit alleges.\nAs the loan\u2019s maturity approached, Karp couldn\u2019t refinance the debt and defaulted, the suit says. Adding fuel to the allegations, BBG issued a second appraisal in 2024 valuing the same property at $29.6 million, a $16.6 million drop from the 2019 figure. Karp claims in the suit that the swing can\u2019t be explained by market conditions alone and instead proves the earlier appraisal was fraudulently inflated.\nThe property was ultimately sold at a foreclosure auction for $10 million to the Greystone affiliate. Karp is now on the hook for a $15 million personal guarantee.\n\u201cAll of this stems from a fraudulent appraisal and a loan that never should have been entered into,\u201d Karp\u2019s attorney Muriel Raggi said.\nKarp is seeking at least $16.6 million in damages tied to the alleged appraisal inflation, along with $122 million against Greystone and Rosenberg, alleging they cost him other opportunities by locking him into an exclusive loan letter of intent on other properties in his portfolio.\nRepresentatives for Greystone did not immediately respond to a request for comment. BBG declined to comment, saying they had not yet seen the suit.\nOnce a rising Brooklyn developer known for his sleek, \u201cHello\u201d-branded luxury rentals, Karp saw his empire unravel after his projects fell into distress. He has blamed Madison Realty Capital for buying his debt and piling on default interest (a charge the firm disputes) as foreclosures and bankruptcies swept through his portfolio.\n",

        "content": "\u201cNews\u201d is something important that happens. It can also be something that doesn\u2019t.\nIf Mayor Zohran Mamdani does not attempt to get the City Council to override Eric Adams\u2019 veto of the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act, that would be news.\nI say this because Mamdani has been a big proponent of COPA and its equivalent bill in Albany, TOPA (Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act). The bills, heavily opposed by the real estate industry, would\nstall sales\nof multifamily buildings for months to give tenants and nonprofits a better chance to buy them.\nAt this writing, Mamdani is just a few votes away from getting it enacted by the City Council. COPA passed with 30 votes and needs 34 to override the veto. (\nEleven\nof the Council\u2019s 51 members took office after the initial vote.)\nIn theory, it should not be hard for a popular new mayor coming off a resounding election victory \u2014 and a successful handling of his first blizzard \u2014 to flip a few votes in the 51-member Council.\nBut Mamdani has a lot of reasons not to even try on COPA.\nFor one thing, he doesn\u2019t want to big-foot new Council Speaker Julie Menin in the first month of their tenures. He just\npatched up their relationship\nand is going to need her for the next four years. Menin abstained from December\u2019s COPA vote and doesn\u2019t seem at all motivated to marshal votes to override the veto.\nSecond, Mamdani\u2019s base, including the Democratic Socialists of America, does not seem to be pushing for him to override the veto \u2014 even though COPA has been a DSA dream for some time.\nDSA often advocates for ideological bills, but has enough sense not to demand that its handful of elected members fall on their swords in an effort to pass them.\nThird, there\u2019s a racial and religious dynamic of which Mamdani must be very mindful: City Council member Darlene Mealy rounded up opposition to COPA by arguing it would be unfair to\nBlack and Jewish landlords\n. That\u2019s in large part why it fell short of a 34-vote \u201cveto-proof\u201d majority.\nMamdani\u2019s issues with conservative Jews have been well documented and he has been criticized for not naming any Black deputy mayors. \u201cIt has become a problem,\u201d a New York Times headline\ndeclared\n.\nHis failure to appoint a single Black deputy mayor came despite his desire to shore up support in heavily Black areas, where he got only 29 percent of the Democratic primary vote last June. This would not be a good time for him to anger Black and Jewish landlords, who are already furious about his call for a four-year freeze on stabilized rents and his pending\n\u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings\n.\nFourth, if he tries to override the veto and fails, that would show political weakness, especially after he tried and failed to stop Menin from becoming speaker. The optics of a second defeat in two months would be bad, and it would make it harder for him to win other battles.\nFor those reasons, it looks like my colleague Kathryn Brenzel\u2019s\nstory\nMonday was spot on: COPA is DOA.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nI misunderstood a sentence in a\nTRD story\nto mean that Summit Properties is raising money on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange for its purchase of the Pinnacle portfolio. That is not the case, according to a Summit spokesperson. The TASE disclosures it filed about the Pinnacle deal were to provide transparency for potential investors in an unrelated Summit investment.\nI was\ntrying to estimate\nSummit\u2019s potential return on investment for the Pinnacle acquisition. To do that, one would divide its annual profit by the $112.8 million it is contributing to the $451.3 million purchase. My rough calculation comes to 11 percent. Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Many apartment leases in Germany require tenants to open their windows several times a day, \u201ceven \u2014 or especially \u2014 in winter,\u201d the Washington Post\nreported\nin a story about the practice, called l\u00fcften. \u201cGerman courts have ruled that, absent specific landlord guidance, a tenant is required to open windows twice a day, morning and evening, for 10 minutes each.\u201d Via TikTok, the practice has spread to America, where it\u2019s called \u201chouse burping.\u201d\nElsewhere\u2026\nQueens Borough President Donovan Richards, perhaps the most pro-housing elected official in the city, told\nGothamist\nthat if a City Council member asks him to sustain the Council\u2019s rejection of new housing, \u201cthere has to be a scientific reason why either you\u2019re going to kill the project or have a substantial reduction in the unit counts.\u201d\nRichards and the other borough presidents have\nbecome relevant\nin land-use approvals again by virtue of a\nCity Charter revision\npassed by voters in November.\nRichards knows that when NIMBYs oppose a project or rezoning, their rationale is less scientific than emotional (fear of change) or financial (keeping housing scarce increases their homes\u2019 value).\nThey do often present a scientific reason, but not based on any data, such as \u201cthe sewer system cannot handle it\u201d or \u201cthe streets will be gridlocked.\u201d Which makes it pseudo-science. Richards has undoubtedly noticed that ordinary citizens suddenly become infrastructure experts when faced with the prospect of new neighbors.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$24.3 million\nfor a 4,997-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at 20 East 76th Street on the Upper East Side.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$8 million\nfor a 17-unit apartment building at 44 Perry Street in the West Village.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$10 million\nfor a pre-war co-op at 820 Park Avenue in Lenox Hill. Daniella G. Schlisser, Justin J. Pak and Gigi Ozdemir with Brown Harris Stevens have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 43,127-square-foot, 79-unit residential building at 9528 147th Place in Jamaica. Leandro Dickson filed the permit on behalf of Herman Jacob.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "There were 180 transactions totaling $1.2 billion filed in New York City records in the 24 hours before 4 p.m. on Tuesday, Jan. 27.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Residential:\nThe most expensive home sale recorded in New York was for a sponsor unit at the\nReuben Brothers\u2019\n20 East 76th Street\non the Upper East Side, known as The Surrey Residences. The nearly 5,000-square-foot pad sold to\nUptown Fun, LLC\nfor $24.3 million, the unit\u2019s asking price. It has three bedrooms, four and a half baths and a terrace. Douglas Elliman\u2019s\nLauren Muss\nand\nMichelle Griffith\nhad the listing.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nSoho was home to the priciest commercial transaction that hit records in the city. A two-story store, occupied by shoe company Birkenstock, at\n120 Spring Street\nchanged hands for $18.5 million. The seller was an LLC tied to\nIcon Realty Management,\nand the buyer was\nFukuru Co., Ltd.\n, an ultra-high-net-worth private investor from Japan, according to\nAdirondack Capital Partners\n, which represented the seller.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nIn the West Village, an affiliate of New York-based\nCentra Management\npicked up a five-story walk-up at\n44 Perry Street\nfor $8 million. The seller was an LLC tied to\nLarry Warsh\nand\nMarlene Yanalom.\nThe property has 17 units and was built in the mid-19th century. It went on the market in March with Serhant\u2019s\nDominique Florio\nfor $9.2 million, according to\nStreetEasy\n.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Willow Stowe\n, an attorney,\nand\nMatteo Vesprini-Heidrich\npaid $3.6 million for a co-op at\n118 East 25th Street\nin the Flatiron District. The seller was\nAlissa Levin\n, founder of creative studio Point Five, who had owned the 4,000-square-foot residence since 2011, when she purchased it for $400,000. Douglas Elliman\u2019s\nJosh Rubin\nrepresented the seller. The unit went on the market in September for just under $4 million.\nBy the Numbers:\nThese were the most expensive neighborhoods in Brooklyn in 2025\nBrooklyn\u2019s residential market grew in 2025, thanks to a record-smashing deal in Gravesend and strong appetite for homes in\ntree-lined, brownstone-heavy\nneighborhoods close to Manhattan.\nCobble Hill led the charge, as it did in 2024, with the highest average home sale price last year, according to a\nTRD\nData analysis of deeds filed with the city last year. However, Cobble Hill\u2019s average of about $2.9 million was about 5 percent lower than its average of $3.1 million the year before.\nNeighborhoods closer to Manhattan dominated the top 100 home sales in Brooklyn last year. For instance, the second-priciest deal was for a Brooklyn Heights townhouse at\n35 Remsen Street\nthat went for more than $18.4 million.\nHere is where Brooklyn\u2019s top home sales were located last year.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

Before that, she held various other city jobs and worked as chief of staff and director of budget and legislation for Council member Margaret Chin.\nShe also brings experience that doesn\u2019t often appear on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 otherwise dominated by public service: Kitasei is an author of speculative fiction. Her forthcoming novel, \u201cEnvoy,\u201d is described as a sci-fi mystery thriller about five astronauts who become the target of an unknown killer.\nDCAS, among other responsibilities, manages the city\u2019s roughly 400 leases at private properties, spanning 22 million square feet, alongside the city\u2019s own 15 million square feet. The little-known agency was recently dragged into the limelight after investigators seized the phones of Adams\u2019 administration officials as they were returning from vacation together in late 2024.\nThose officials included\nJesse Hamilton\n, then the deputy commissioner of real estate at the DCAS. The incident heightened scrutiny around some of the deals Hamilton worked on or\npromoted\n, including a warehouse in the Bronx the city ultimately decided against buying. \u00a0 Hamilton was indicted in August on a conspiracy charge related to allegedly working with Ingrid Lewis-Martin, a former top aide to the mayor, to speed up certain developers\u2019 projects and steer city contracts to preferred players. He\nresigned\nin August.\nKitasei is stepping into the role after J. Carolina Chavez, who has served as acting commissioner since Commissioner Louis Molina resigned last month.\n",

        "content": "PMG and Lndmrk Development are launching a Frida Kahlo-branded short-term rental-friendly condominium in Miami\u2019s Wynwood, their latest partnership in the neighborhood.\nThe likeness of the famed Mexican communist will decorate one of the luxury project\u2019s facades, renderings show. The developers are planning the 244-unit Frida Kahlo Wynwood Residences for the 1-acre site at 119 Northwest 29th Street, which they bought for\n$20 million\nin 2023, according to property records.\nThey tapped Uruguayan-Canadian architect Carlos Ott, Cube 3, and Cotofana Designs to design the complex, according to a news release. It will span two buildings, with an eight-story north tower and a 14-story south tower, a spokesperson confirmed. Units will range from studios to three-bedrooms and come fully furnished.\nThe condo\u2019s amenities will include a rooftop pool, a fitness center, spa facilities and a lobby lounge, the release shows. Prices for the units start at $500,000 and range up to $1.6 million, the spokesperson confirmed. PMG will lead sales in-house for the project.\nThe developers are also partnering with Baker Health, a New York-based concierge medicine service, to open its first Florida location on the ground floor of the project. Residents will receive a free membership to the service for one year, the release shows.\nThe late Frida Kahlo is one of the most famous women artists in the world, and her paintings are among the most valuable. Her 1940 painting \u201cEl sue\u00f1o (La cama)\u201d sold for a record $55 million at Sotheby\u2019s in November, making it the most expensive piece ever sold at auction by a woman artist. The record for men is held by Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cSalvator Mundi,\u201d which sold for $450.3 million in 2017.\nWhile the November auction sale was notable for its price, it was also remarkable as Kahlo\u2019s paintings are rarely available for purchase.\nHer husband, Diego Rivera, bequeathed the couple\u2019s works to the people of Mexico, and the Bank of Mexico owns and manages their trust and estate.\nThat her name and likeness can be licensed for condo branding purposes is the result of her niece Isolda Pineda Kahlo\u2019s 2004 partnership with ItalBank president Carlos Dorado. The pair created the Frida Kahlo Corporation and trademarked the artist\u2019s name, face and signature.\nSince Pineda Kahlo\u2019s death in 2007, the corporation has come into conflict with her daughter, who sued in 2019 over the creation of a Frida Kahlo Barbie.\nThe branding agreement between the Frida Kahlo Corporation, PMG and Lndmrk is an example of one of South Florida\u2019s busiest new development categories: branded residences.\nThousands of units are planned or in development across the region bearing familiar logos from\nfashion houses\n,\nhospitality empires\n,\nhypercar makers\n,\nrestaurant groups\nand\nmagazines\n. Developers see brands as a way to signal expectations of prestige and hospitality service to buyers, and a way to differentiate projects in a crowded marketplace.\nThat said, industry leaders have also advised caution on brand selection.\n\u201cNot all brands are created equal,\u201d Cervera Real Estate\u2019s Alicia Cervera Lamadrid said at\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\n2024 Miami Forum\n.\nPMG and Lndmrk opted out of branding for their other Wynwood condo project. Miami-based PMG, led by Ryan Shear, Dan Kaplan and Kevin Maloney, and Alex Karakhanian\u2019s Miami-based Lndmrk launched sales for the 233-unit short-term rental-friendly\nTwenty Sixth &amp; 2nd Wynwood Residences\nin April, with prices for studios starting at $500,000.\n",

        "content": "Real estate remained upbeat on a\nproposed ballot measure\nto amend the so-called\nmansion tax\neven as the Los Angeles City Council told one of its most prominent members to slow her rollback.\nA fiery debate ensued during Tuesday\u2019s Los Angeles City Council meeting over the fast-tracking of a proposed 15-year carveout of the Measure United to House L.A. tax for new multifamily, commercial and mixed-use developments, in addition to an exemption for property owners impacted by a natural disaster.\nCurrently, ULA applies a 4 percent property transfer tax on all real estate deals \u2013 commercial or single-family \u2013 starting at $5.3 million. The tax bumps up to 5.5 percent on deals of $10.6 million or more.\nThe request to draft a ballot measure for June was made Friday by progressive councilwoman Nithya Raman, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America who became a leader of the progressive wing of the council in part for her role as an early a proponent of Measure ULA\u2019s stated mission of\nfunding homelessness and affordable housing programs\n.\nRaman said the amendments would fix the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of the two-tier tax, noting that ULA \u201cwas sold to voters as a mansion tax\u201d but also applies to other segments of\u00a0 real estate and has cast a pall over dealmaking and development of apartments and commercial projects.\nShe told her colleagues on the 15-seat council that it has essentially placed \u201ca transfer tax on all properties over $5 million, including apartments and we have to be honest about what has happened as a result.\u201d\nThe biggest takeaway of Raman\u2019s proposal would be a permanent, 15-year carveout seen as an incentive for new construction of multifamily properties of at least four units. It would also apply to commercial projects, defined as anything that doesn\u2019t have residential. It\u2019s the first major proposal aimed at addressing Measure ULA\u2019s effect on the multifamily and commercial segments.\nSean Burton, CEO and chief investment officer of Cityview, hailed Raman\u2019s motion as a \u201chuge move forward\u201d and the result of several months of negotiations between government officials, the business community, real estate interests and non-profits looking at ways of fixing the tax.\nSome of Raman\u2019s peers lashed out at the lack of public debate over the proposal.\nThat included 7th District representative Monica Rodriguez, who took Raman to task for the \u201cfalse narrative\u201d used to prompt ULA during a citywide campaign in 2022, accusing her colleague of selling the tax to voters without any studies.\n\u201cWe knew that these were the implications \u2026 when we were having these conversations around ULA and we\u2019ve been calling it out for, oh, well over a year, but it was convenient to ignore it when the money was being doled out to different initiatives that people wanted to support,\u201d Rodriguez told Raman during Tuesday\u2019s meeting.\nRaman\u2019s colleagues on Tuesday kicked her proposal for a ballot measure on the proposed carveouts to the Housing and Homelessness Committee rather than holding a vote of the full council.\nMore recent attempts to amend ULA have largely been spurred by Palisades\nFire-impacted property owners\n. Those concerns are also addressed in Raman\u2019s proposal with a one-time, three-year exemption in cases of natural disasters that would be retroactive to January of last year.\nMeanwhile, there are language changes as it relates to existing affordable housing exemptions.\nBaby steps\nEven with what\u2019s on the table, real estate says there could be more.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really good step in the right direction,\u201d Cityview\u2019s Burton said of the proposed changes. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly not going as far as many in the city would like and many real estate interests would like.\u201d\nStill, the CEO said a full repeal of the tax isn\u2019t practical and Raman\u2019s proposal will \u201ckickstart the building of housing again.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen construction fall off a cliff for any sort of market rate housing or affordable housing,\u201d Burton said of the market since the tax went into effect. \u201cL.A.\u2019s been redlined by the investment community because of ULA. It makes investing in L.A. non-economic. I think the mayor realizes that and the councilwoman realizes that. I give her credit for having the guts to push this.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad policy to begin with,\u201d Mike Leipart, co-founder and managing principal of real estate sales and advisory firm Redeavor, said of ULA. \u201cBut, setting that aside, [the proposal\u2019s] better than nothing. Treating multifamily and commercial with the same thresholds was absurd from the start. Better than nothing, not near enough, is what I would say.\u201d\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California founder and CEO Aaron Kirman agreed.\n\u201cAny policy that encourages development and acknowledges the economic realities facing builders and property owners is a positive step,\u201d Kirman said.\nThe luxury residential agent hailed the natural disaster exemptions but noted \u201cthere is still work to be done to ensure ULA does not continue to discourage investment at a time when Los Angeles needs housing and economic momentum.\u201d\nMott Smith, an adjunct professor of real estate at the University of Southern California Price School and chair of the Council of Infill Builders, offered a blunt assessment of what ULA is and has been for the market.\n\u201cThe only word I know for this is clusterfuck,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s really kind of a mess.\u201d\nFrom Smith\u2019s view, the tax is \u201cfailing on all fronts\u201d except for the fact that it is indeed raising money, albeit at a lower rate than what was first estimated to taxpayers.\n\u201cWhat it is not doing effectively is funding affordable housing and this is because ULA is a ballot box version 1.0 that became law and the people that wrote it wrote it with a high degree of specificity and rigidity about how the money gets spent,\u201d he said.\n\u201cRushed\u201d process\nOpposition to the proposed amendments say the changes give in to real estate interests and stymie a revenue source that is upholding its promise to voters.\nThe Measure United to House coalition \u2014 a group of nonprofits, labor unions, affordable housing builders, homeless service providers and other supporters of the tax \u2014 said ULA revenue has been pumped into 795 affordable homes and provided rental or other assistance to 10,000 people in the city.\nThe coalition\u2019s director Joe Donlin called the proposed amendments \u201crushed\u201d and sided with the councilmembers who said it lacks any formal public discussion.\n\u201cThis is really a conversation about something that\u2019s really working for the city,\u201d Donlin said.\nCritics of the tax say otherwise and point to the $1 billion-metric that is touted by supporters. Since April 2023, when the tax went into effect, it has generated a little over $1 billion. The text of the measure that went before voters estimated the tax would generate anywhere from $600 million to $1.1 billion annually.\nDonlin also disputed any claims that the real estate market has been hindered by ULA.\n\u201cThe real estate market in L.A., just like real estate markets all around the country, have been deeply impacted by big, macroeconomic factors like high interest rates and inflating insurance premiums and higher construction costs,\u201d Donlin said. \u201cAnd, yet, we also have seen at each stage of the development process there are signs that L.A.\u2019s real estate market is trending in an upward direction.\u201d\n",

        "content": "In what is shaping into a recent Chicagoland trend, a proposed $2 billion data center in\nBarrington Hills\nis officially dead, the latest sign that suburban Chicago\u2019s once-red-hot data center pipeline is running into organized resistance.\nVillage officials announced that Chicago-based Brennan Investment Group withdrew its proposal for a massive data center campus planned south of Penny Road and west of Pond Gate Drive. The Daily Herald\nreported\nthat the developer canceled a scheduled public presentation before the village\u2019s plan commission slated for Feb. 2 after what officials described as negative early feedback.\n\u201cAt this time, the village considers this matter closed and does not anticipate any further discussion,\u201d a village spokesperson said in a Facebook post announcing the withdrawal. The special meeting was canceled.\nDetails on the project were limited, but the scale alone set off alarm bells in the rural enclave known for its large estates and conservation-focused zoning. Opposition quickly mobilized, according to the outlet. A Change.org\npetition\nurging officials to reject the development had collected more than 1,300 signatures as of Tuesday, citing concerns about air pollution, water quality and long-term tax impacts.\n\u201cWe cannot allow this proposal to compromise the very essence of what makes Barrington Hills a special place,\u201d the petition stated.\nBrennan, which has been active in data centers, is the developer of similar projects in\nElk Grove Village\nand Rolling Meadows, according to public records. The firm did not publicly comment on its decision to pull the Barrington Hills proposal.\nThe retreat highlights how quickly the political calculus around data centers has shifted. For years, the facilities were the quiet darlings of municipal finance, with massive capital investment, limited traffic and steady property tax revenue. Approvals were\noften routine\n, as previously chronicled in\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThat era appears to be ending, at least in parts of suburban Chicago.\nJust last week, Lisle officials\npaused a proposed data center\nafter residents packed Village Hall with objections. In Naperville, the City Council rejected Karis Critical\u2019s data center proposal in a 6-1 vote following months of neighborhood opposition. Aurora, meanwhile, enacted a 180-day\nmoratorium\nin September to revisit its data center regulations, signaling broader unease with the facilities.\nThe local backlash comes even as the regional data center boom continues to\nsurge\n. In northwest Indiana, Amazon is planning multiple data center campuses with total investment that could exceed $15 billion, including a confirmed site in Hobart. Farther north, T5 Data Centers has spent more than $60 million assembling land in\nGrayslake\n, a project that has already required significant power commitments from ComEd and drawn scrutiny over its proximity to homes.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The Latin School of Chicago is heading for the exits on four historic\nNear North Side\nhomes it scooped up just four years ago, preparing to sell the properties at an estimated $2 million loss.\nThe private school is marketing four buildings on the 1500 block of North Dearborn Street that it bought in spring 2022 for just over $10 million,\naccording\nto Crain\u2019s. The combined asking price for all four is about $8.1 million, with two already listed and two more expected to hit the market shortly.\nLatin acquired the homes in three deals as part of a long-term vision to expand and improve facilities for its lower school, serving students from junior kindergarten through fourth grade. But plans changed. In a letter sent to the school community in November and shared with the publication, board leaders said a subsequent multimillion-dollar upgrade to the existing lower school building eliminated the need for the Dearborn properties.\nThe letter also cited the disruption that a major construction project would cause, noting that redevelopment of the four buildings would likely require years of relocation for students and staff. The school declined to comment on the decision to sell at a loss.\nTwo of the properties, redstone buildings at 1511 and 1515 North Dearborn dating to 1890, were listed this week at $1.6 million apiece. The interiors were already gutted when Latin bought them and remain shells, according to\nCompass agent Jeff Lowe\n, who is marketing the pair. Latin is hoping to sell them together, potentially to a developer eyeing condos or to a buyer interested in restoring them as single-family homes.\nThe other two buildings, greystones at 1505 and 1507 Dearborn\nbuilt in the 1880s\n, contain a combined 15 apartments and are expected to list soon for just under $4.9 million, combined. Lowe and Interra Realty\u2019s\nJoe Smazal\nwill handle that listing, according to the publication. Those buildings are being sold as going concerns, with leased units and a mix of historic and modern finishes.\nAt the time of the purchase, then\u2013head of school Randall Dunn said Latin had no specific plan, but wanted to secure rare real estate opportunities in a dense neighborhood. Three years later, the school\u2019s own\nstudent newspaper reported\nthat concrete plans for the properties had yet to materialize, while the school was spending roughly $290,000 a year on taxes and maintenance.\nThe sale comes amid leadership turnover, with two heads of school departing since the acquisitions.\nLatin will still be a dominant presence on the block. Including the four buildings now for sale, the school owns eight of the 10 properties on the east side of Dearborn between North Avenue and Burton Place, anchored by an 18,000-square-foot mansion it bought in 2017 for $12 million.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s residential brokerages kicked off the new year with new agent recruits as industry consolidation pushes companies to sharpen their recruiting pitches.\nBaird &amp; Warner announced Steve Jasinski was returning to the firm after five years with Berkshire Hathaway Home Services Chicago. Jasinski is leading the Jasinski Home Team at Baird &amp; Warner\u2019s La Grange office.\nIn a press release, the firm said Jasinski\u2019s return was an example of its\nappeal as a local powerhouse\nversus a field of nationally consolidated competitors.\nWhen Jasinski left Baird &amp; Warner in 2021, he said he thought of it as \u201cyour grandfather\u2019s real estate company.\u201d Its purchase of\ntech-focused Dream Town\nin 2025 made him interested in coming back, he said.\nWhen he returned in December, he said he was surprised at how much the firm had embraced technology. The company\nreleased an AI chatbot\nfor its agents in December.\n\u201cThey actually have systems that are functioning and working together, and are actively working on new ones,\u201d Jasinski said. \u201cIt was truly like night and day.\u201d\nJasinski spent the last five years at Berkshire Hathaway Home Services Chicago, and was a Baird &amp; Warner agent for nine years before that.\nJasinski\u2019s team closed $26.5 million in sales across 70 transactions in 2024, according to Real Trends. He has two more agents on his team and said he\u2019s interested in expanding.\nBaird &amp; Warner also recently picked up a Highland Park team from Compass, citing the addition as another example of the firm\u2019s ability to attract talent from the most competitive national firms.\nThe Gerber Diaz Group, led by Louis Diaz and Joe Tyler Gerber, moved to Baird &amp; Warner\u2019s Highland Park office in late 2025. Gerber closed more than $25 million in sales volume in 2024, Baird &amp; Warner said.\nBaird &amp; Warner said in a press release the brokerage\u2019s independence and local origin was a major influence in their decision to jump from Compass.\nCompass adds team with multifamily focus\nMeanwhile,\nCompass\nis attracting heavy hitters by pitching its own technology platform and reach. In early January, the brokerage brought on Charlie Cohen and Alex Morsch to create the Cohen Morsch team.\nThe five-agent team had combined annual sales of $57.5 million, Compass said in a press release. The group will focus on brokering multifamily and investment properties.\nCohen was most recently director of sales at Cross Street. In a press release announcing the move, Cohen said Compass\u2019 platform and tools will \u201celevate how we serve clients.\u201d\nMorsch was most recently a senior broker at Cross Street, Compass said. Morsch represented the buyer on a three-lot development site in Lincoln Park that sold for $5.7 million last year, the release said.\nCompass\nfinalized its acquisition of Anywhere Real Estate\nthis month, with the megamerger bringing some of Chicago\u2019s top brokerages under Compass\u2019 umbrella.\nJameson Sotheby\u2019s gains Baird &amp; Warner agent\nJameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\nis also expanding its roster. The firm brought on Joanne DeSanctis Kirk to its Chicago City Hub office this month.\nDeSanctis Kirk, who was previously at Baird &amp; Warner, said she wasn\u2019t expecting to make a move. But after conversations with Jameson Sotheby\u2019s representatives, she felt it was a good fit and gave her support as a solo agent. She said the firm\u2019s coordinated support between marketing and transactions has been a benefit.\n\u201cI had good support previously, but it was bifurcated,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this is kind of a one stop shop.\u201d\nAs a solo agent, DeSanctis Kirk averages about $10 million to $15 million in sales a year, she said. She closed about $13.8 million in sales across 17 transactions between October 2024 and October 2025, according to data compiled by\nThe Real Deal.\nHer sales are spread across Chicago but focused in the North Side, she said.\nColdwell Banker brings on North Shore manager\nAt Coldwell Banker Realty, Natasha O\u2019Connor was appointed branch vice president of the brokerage\u2019s North Shore offices in Glenbrook and Lake Forest, Chicago Agent reported this month.\nO\u2019Connor was formerly a managing broker at @properties until 2023, according to her LinkedIn.

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s multifamily construction drought isn\u2019t expected to improve any time soon, a report from Marcus and Millichap predicts.\nBy analyzing planned and ongoing multifamily developments, the brokerage predicts that this year Chicago is on track to see the smallest number of new apartments completed since 2012.\nLess than 4,000 new units will be completed this year, according to the report.\nThe pipeline issue has been brewing for a few years. Chicago\u2019s inventory of multifamily units grew at the fourth-slowest pace among major U.S. markets for the past three years, the brokerage found.\nPart of that is due to higher interest rates and escalating construction costs. But it\u2019s supercharged in Chicago specifically due to restrictive zoning,\ninfluence of aldermanic privilege over new developments\n,\nupheaval in the property tax system\nand investors\u2019 and lenders\u2019 fears of the city\u2019s progressive policies. Among them are right of first refusal ordinances that are\ncurrently being tested\nin\nseveral neighborhoods.\nThe tight supply is good news for current multifamily building owners and sellers, but means competition is high among buyers, and developers will face less equity investment and lending.\nAs low supply has driven up rents in recent years, Marcus &amp; Millichap predicts that trend will slow this year due to a slowdown in hiring that typically brings new professionals to the city.\nAcross the metro area, the 20 to 34-year-old renter population has been shrinking, according to the report.\nThe brokerage predicts that investment activity will continue to pick up along the North Lakefront-Rogers Park corridor in 2026.\nMeanwhile, developers seem to be favoring the outer suburbs. Lake County-Kenosha is slated to receive the most new units in 2026, the report found.\nAn Interra Realty report from last year found that\nmultifamily building sales in the Chicago suburbs were up 40 percent, year-over-year\n, in the third quarter, and a few outer-ring counties stood out in the competitive field.\nWill County\u2019s largest deal last year was the sale of the\nLincoln Station Apartments.\nAfter a decade-long construction quest and an ensuing legal dispute, rescue capital lender 7 Acre Investments gave developer Richard Gammonley the green light to sell his newly built complex in New Lenox. Miami-based JSB Capital bought the 220-unit property from Gammonley and 7 Acre for $65 million.",

Building 12 at 1070 Maryland Street spans approximately 200,000 square feet and was once home to shipbuilding operations during World War II. The firm\u2019s move into 70,000 square feet makes it one of the largest venture capital tenants in San Francisco history by footprint, according to the Chronicle.\nGeneral Catalyst is moving from a roughly 12,000-square-foot office at 75 Hawthorne Street in\nSouth of Market\n.\nBuilding 12 has already\nattracted\nretail tenants such as Breadbelly and Standard Deviant Brewing and is the first part of Brookfield\u2019s plans for Pier 70, the San Francisco Business Times reported. New York-based Brookfield has been approved to turn the Pier 70 property into as many as 2,150 homes and nearly 1.8 million square feet of commercial space.\nBrookfield initially planned to deliver the first phase of Pier 70, including hundreds of homes and almost half a million square feet of offices, between 2022 and 2024, though the pandemic slowed down those efforts. So far, Brookfield has delivered new site infrastructure and renovated Building 12, both of which were completed before construction stalled. The 28-acre waterfront redevelopment is a public-private partnership between Brookfield and the Port of San Francisco and was valued at $3.5 billion in 2020.\nGeneral Catalyst manages $43 billion in assets and has backed\nAirbnb\n, Instacart and\nAnthropic\n\u2014 all companies with San Francisco headquarters. It won\u2019t be the only venture capital firm at Pier 70, as Monograph Capital inked a lease there in 2024.

        "content": "Seguin is officially putting public backing behind one of its largest commercial retail projects to date.\nThe Seguin City Council authorized City Manager Steve Parker last week to move forward with an economic development agreement with NewQuest for a 543-acre tract at the northwest corner of I-10 and Highway 46, within the Austin-San Antonio corridor. The San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\nthat the deal advances plans for Seguin Town Center, a master-planned project that could ultimately deliver more than 600,000 square feet of retail and anchor the city\u2019s fast-growing north side.\nNewQuest\n, a Houston-based retail and mixed-use developer, spent years assembling and entitling large sites across Texas. In Seguin, the firm is positioning Town Center as a regional draw rather than a neighborhood strip center, city officials told the outlet.\nThe agreement approved by council is tied to a Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone created last year that covers the\nNewQuest site\n. Under the structure, a portion of the new tax revenue generated by development can be reinvested back into the project area. Guadalupe County has agreed to participate in the TIRZ, while\nSeguin\nis capturing part of the increment, allowing additional revenue from the site to flow into the city\u2019s general fund.\nCity leaders emphasized that the incentives are fully performance-based. No upfront payments are required, and if NewQuest fails to build, the city pays nothing.\nTo qualify for incentives, the developer must meet minimum thresholds, including at least $75 million in capital investment, construction of at least 200,000 square feet of retail and a lease from a nationally branded anchor tenant of at least 60,000 square feet, according to meeting documents. If those benchmarks are hit, NewQuest could receive up to $23.5 million in incentive value over a 20-year term, capped at roughly 10 percent of the project\u2019s anticipated value and limited to retail components.\nEconomic Development Director Alora Wachholz, who took the role in November, said the agreement signals alignment between the city and the developer and moves the project closer to construction.\nNewQuest is preparing to begin infrastructure and drainage work required before vertical construction can start. Groundbreaking for the first phase of retail is expected before mid-2026, with additional tenant announcements anticipated throughout the year.\nThe timing reflects\nSeguin\u2019s growth trajectory\n. The city\u2019s population has climbed from about 27,550 in 2015 to nearly 39,000 currently and is projected to top 50,000 by 2030, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Irvine Company\n\u2019s plans to turn the\nOak Creek Golf Club\ninto a master-planned community are coming into focus.\nThe Newport Beach-based development firm\nunveiled\nplans to add a 50-acre nature park to its proposed redevelopment of the Oak Creek Golf Club in Irvine, the Orange County Business Journal reported.\nThe broader redevelopment plan for the golf course, dubbed Oak Park Village, would cover approximately 216 acres at the northeastern end of the Irvine Spectrum District.\nThe area has been approved for 5,000 homes, and Irvine Company originally planned to build 3,100 residential units in a mix of apartments and single-family homes, an elementary school and parks as well as make improvements to transportation and infrastructure in the area.\nWith the new planned nature park, the number of residential units is expected to decrease as the green space would abut the Southern California Edison easement along Jeffrey Road between Walnut Avenue and Irvine Center Drive. Any possible changes to housing plans have not been revealed.\nIrvine Company officials are seeking the city\u2019s approval for the park by this summer, with work expected to begin early next year.\nCity politicians\nview the proposed Oak Park Village as beneficial in helping the municipality in meeting its state-mandated housing goals, which include\nplanning\nfor 23,610 new units by 2029.\nOn Jan. 15, the Committee to Protect All Irvine Open Space filed paperwork for a citizen initiative to reaffirm Initiative 88-1, a measure approved by voters in 1988 that requires citywide voter approval before residential development can occur on land designated as permanent open space.\nRolf Parkes, the vice chair of the committee which also includes two former Irvine mayors, said that part of the 216-acre Oak Park Village project consists of areas that the city has long deemed \u201copen space.\u201d Parkes is in favor of the nature park but is opposed to building homes and apartments that would bring increased traffic and congestion to the area, he told the Business Journal.\nThe committee hopes to collect signatures from more than 19,000 registered voters in Irvine to\nput the issue before voters\non the November ballot. Irvine Company cannot develop other open space areas outside the Oak Creek Golf Club because the firm transferred ownership of the land to the city, a spokesperson told the Business Journal.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

In Texas, some have bet on Fredericksburg, the seat of deer hunting, wine tasting and hobby farming country.\nNot many likely would bet on Houston.\nTexas\u2019 most populous, sprawling city isn\u2019t a getaway resort town. But according to agent Tommy Kanarellis, who recently returned to Houston after several years working in Aspen, an opportunity awaits to satisfy the mounting demand for luxury living in the Bayou City.\nThe Ritz-Carlton Residences of Houston\n, one of\nseveral branded condo projects underway\nin the city, hired Kanarellis as associate sales director, according to a press release from\nRedeavor Group\n, which is managing sales for the development.\nKanarellis was the\ntop-ranked condo sales agent\nin Houston in 2021, when he worked for the Houston office of Compass Real Estate.\nHe left Compass in 2022\n, worked a brief stint at Douglas Elliman, and returned to Compass in 2023. After working in both cities, helping Houstonians find second homes in Aspen, Kanarellis devoted his energies to Colorado starting in 2023, according to his personal website.\nWhile general housing abounds in the Houston area, luxury homes are in short supply, according to local agents. Luxury sells faster in Houston compared to other Texas metros, and\nit occupies a remarkably tight quarter\nof the sprawling city.\nNot much exists outside of River Oaks and Memorial Villages\n.\nThe Ritz-Carlton Residences of Houston isn\u2019t the only branded condo project taking shape in Houston. With buyers from the aerospace, medicine and energy industries in the mix, Houston developers are racing to refine the city\u2019s luxury living options.\nAuberge-branded and St. Regis-branded projects\nare also in the works, and\nanother Ritz-Carlton project is rising in the Woodlands\n.\nElsewhere in Houston, Ryan Fassett is joining Houston-based commercial real estate firm Oxford Partners as senior vice president, according to a press release. Fassett has focused on office and industrial tenant representation during his 15-year career, including posts at UGL Equis, Moody Rambin and Lee &amp; Associates.\nMeanwhile, Dallas-based architecture and engineering firm Premier, a privately owned subsidiary of\nMonty Bennett\n\u2019s Ashford, promoted Johannes Michalsky to CEO on Jan. 1, according to a press release. Michalsky has spent 12 years at Premier, including a year as COO since 2024.\nAshford focuses primarily on hospitality, but Premier also operates in the student housing and general multifamily sectors.\n",

It\u2019s one of 90 condos at the 37-story tower planned for 102 Asbury Street at the doorstep of Houston\u2019s exclusive River Oaks neighborhood. The property\u2019s 40,000 square feet of amenities will include a 20th-floor cognac bar, pool deck with cabanas, spa, and to protect the property from Texas\u2019 notoriously finicky electrical grid, a full-building generator back-up.\nDouglas Elliman said the listing boasts the highest price per square foot in the history of Houston condo sales.\nHouston Association of Realtors data backs up the grandiose claim. The top 10 most expensive high-rise sales recorded in Houston range in asking price from $4.9 million to $7.5 million, putting prices per square foot at between $421 and $1,290.\nA unit at The Huntingdon, at 2121 Kirby Drive, tops the list, according to HAR. The 7,265-square-foot condo was listed for $7.5 million, or just over $1,000 per square foot, when it traded in June 2024.\nDeveloper Satya\u2019s St. Regis project, which is expected to start construction in the first quarter, is part of a\nbranded condo craze\ntaking over Houston. In addition to the St. Regis, other planned projects include a\nRitz-Carlton rising in the Woodlands\n, another\nRitz-Carlton planned for the Galleria\nand Auberge condos coming to Upper Kirby.\nThe Real Deal\npartnered with BSH to\nhost a panel on the trend\nin December at the BSH Experience &amp; Design Center.\nTexas luxury buyers have long favored ranches over vertical living, and, as a result, the state\u2019s\nmarket for luxury condos\nis still largely untapped. That\u2019s partly because it\u2019s hard to get condo projects financed in the Lone Star State. Texas is one of about a dozen states that does not allow developers to use deposits from condo presales on construction. In states without those restrictions, deposits can finance up to 30 percent of construction costs, said DC Partners\u2019 Roberto Contreras IV.\nThe structural challenges mean not much condo inventory exists in Texas metros, but the Houston projects in the pipeline have already started proving the city\u2019s demand for luxury vertical living.\nIn addition to the price record set at the St. Regis,\nRandall Davis Company\u2019s London House\nopened last year in River Oaks with all but two units presold. Up in the Woodlands, Howard Hughes had to temporarily suspend sales for its Ritz-Carlton project because demand was so high. When construction started, 69 percent of the project\u2019s 111 units were presold.\n",

Newman trust, alleges the development entity failed to make short-term guest suites available for condo owners\u2019 invitees, despite promising them as part of marketing the development, according to the suit. The complaint against the development entity, TCH 500 Alton, was filed in Miami-Dade Circuit Court in August.\nThe trust led by Newman, a former portfolio manager at Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Management, paid $17.3 million for a penthouse in 2024, about a month after the 48-story Five Park was\ncompleted\n.\nHe tried to reserve a guest apartment and allegedly was told there\u2019s no such amenity at the tower and that the developers were listing the apartments for sale, the lawsuit claims. Newman is an author and a former portfolio manager of Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Management who focused on sovereign debt.\nCoconut Grove-based Terra, led by David Martin, and Miami-based GFO Investments, Galbut\u2019s family office, developed the\ncondo\nat 500 Alton Road in South Beach with 227 units.\nAs a prospective buyer, Newman was shown marketing materials including a fact sheet promising the guest suites, a mockup identifying nine guest suites on the fifth floor, and a condo declaration saying guest units are available to condo owners and tenants and the relatives, guests and invitees of condo owners, the lawsuit alleges.\nThe developers\u2019 joint venture declined to comment on the allegation.\nIn a court response to the complaint, the joint venture denied wrongdoing and said the short term guest suites aren\u2019t available yet but will be made available for any unit owner\u2019s use.\nFive Park is among the crop of recently completed South Florida condos that became a magnet for well-heeled buyers during the tri-county region\u2019s boom in recent years. In April, Daniel Krizek, a biotech fund manager at Citadel\u2019s Surveyor Capital, paid\n$19.5 million\nfor a Five Park penthouse.\nA limited liability company linked to waste management mogul Patrick Dovigi\u2019s Toronto-based GFL Environmental also bought a penthouse, paying\n$17.5 million\n.\n",

        "content": "A dispute between an investor and a special servicer continues to play out in court.\nInvestor 400 Capital sued Rialto Capital Advisors late last year, accusing the special servicer of improperly keeping a loan in special servicing. Now, Rialto has changed track, but 400 Capital says it doesn\u2019t go far enough.\nIt\u2019s a rare look into a fight between a commercial-backed mortgage securities investor and the nation\u2019s largest special servicer by volume. As of June, Rialto was the named special servicer on more than 5,000 loans with a total unpaid principal of more than $94 billion, according to Morningstar.\nAt the center of the court dispute is a $130 million loan \u2014 one connected to a Herald Square hotel and retail location. The loan landed in special servicing with Rialto in October. The borrower said it hasn\u2019t been able to get a refinancing loan to pay off its original debt before a January due date because of upcoming lease expirations.\nRialto ultimately struck a two-year deal with the borrower. The rub: the servicer calls it a forbearance agreement, but 400 Capital believes it to be a loan modification.\nThat difference in semantics matters to the investor. A loan modification would launch the loan out of special servicing. A forbearance agreement keeps it with Rialto. Staying in special servicing means certain fees for the borrower, as well as default interest, which the investor says benefits Rialto\u2019s but not certificateholders\u2019 interests.\n400 Capital\nfiled the suit in New York\njust before Christmas, seeking emergency action. The company hoped the court would stop Rialto from executing an agreement wherein it would collect millions in default interest before investors got paid out.\nBut Rialto changed the terms of that agreement and then executed it before the court could look into the matter.\nNow 400 Capital has withdrawn its motion for immediate relief, but isn\u2019t abandoning the suit entirely.\nThe investor says Rialto got caught with its hand in the cookie jar, which led to the last-minute change. Rialto has now agreed to get paid on the back end of the loan instead of up front. But the new agreement still keeps the loan in special servicing, meaning a 25 basis point fee paid to Rialto and default interest that piles up to be paid to Rialto once the loan is closed. That adds up to more for the borrower to pay and more for it to borrow.\n\u201cThe refinancing gap is only growing as a result of this agreement,\u201d said Quinn Barton, head of CMBS and CRE at 400 Capital. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing here is making it even more difficult for the borrower to repay the loan.\u201d\nRacking up interests and fees on a performing loan, 400 Capital says, hurts investors by making it less likely the loan will be paid off.\nAnd the loan is indeed performing, the investor argues. Net operating income is more than double its debt service payments, the property is fully leased and has about $6 million in annual excess cash flow.\n\u201cIt would be common for a loan to get a 30-day, 60-day, 90-day forbearance. Even up to a year might be common in our industry,\u201d said Catie McKee of 400 Capital. \u201cBut in this case it just seems very obvious that they have found this loophole where if they call it a forbearance they can keep it in special servicing and keep this whole fee scheme going.\u201d\nRialto, through its investment affiliate Rialto Capital Management, is the country\u2019s largest buyer of CMBS B-piece notes. Those notes give the investor the ability to select the special servicer on the loan, including selecting its own affiliate.\nRialto, for its part, says it\u2019s better for everyone to keep this loan in special servicing. That allows investors to foreclose on the property faster and streamline other remedies in the event of another default. It also allows for easier administration of the full cash sweep the borrower agreed to.\nAnd the default interest that\u2019s accruing incentivizes the borrower to pay off the loan as soon as possible.\n\u201cRialto won\u2019t get paid a dollar of default interest unless everybody else gets paid in full,\u201d Greg Cross, an attorney at Venable who is representing Rialto in the suit, said in a statement. \u201cAnd to the extent they get paid it will come from the borrower, just like any other fee in this transaction.\u201d\nThe 25 basis point fee that Rialto gets paid as an active special servicer would typically be paid by the trust, but in this case Rialto negotiated for it to be paid by the borrower.\nIn court, Rialto is seeking to have the case dismissed, arguing that 400 Capital doesn\u2019t have standing to pursue it. The investor is contractually obligated to bring complaints to its trustee before initiating a lawsuit and 400 Capital did not do that, Cross said in a memo to the court.\n",

The 423,000-square-foot office building would be condensed into 336,000 square feet thanks to design work by Rawlings Architects.\nFeatures of the conversion would include a basement fitness studio, a restaurant and a doctor\u2019s office on the first floor, as well as co-working space, bike storage and a pool on the seventh floor.\nBroad Street\u2019s vice president of operations and construction Ryan Bird filed the permits for the project, which was first reported by\nPincusCo\n.\nOffice tenants at the building include cannabis startup LeafLink and co-working company Regus. One tenant that probably won\u2019t need much convincing to relocate? Broad Street itself, which has its headquarters there.\nBroad Street bought the building in 2014 for $175 million. In December 2017, ownership\nsecured a $102 million mortgage\non the property, courtesy of AIG Investments.\nThe mortgage was issued about a month after Invesco purchased a 95 percent stake in the building from Broad Street for\n$235 million\n. Broad Street retained a 5 percent stake in the tower and continued to manage the property.\nIn 2021, PCCP\nissued \u200b\u200ba $150 million loan\nto refinance the building, shortly after a $9 million capital improvement project that included upgrades to the hallways, restrooms and lobby.\nManhattan\u2019s Financial District, long the money capital of the city, has become a mecca for conversions since the pandemic. Just this month, Samuel Fisch of Blue Fin Equities moved to\nconvert\nthe 28-story building at 40 Fulton Street, planning to build 169 units after acquiring control of the property via a 2022 $88.9 million ground lease with Fulton &amp; Pearl, an affiliate of prominent investor David Werner.\nIn the first eight months of 2025, more than 4 million square feet of office space in the borough was converted to residential use, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield, exceeding the totals for each of the preceding two full years.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "When Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Management makes an investment, it usually means a company, or in certain cases, a country, is in really bad shape.\nThe $76 billion hedge fund is best known for its distressed investments in Argentina\u2019s bonds, resulting in a 15-year legal battle and leading the country to default on its debt. It waged war against Procter &amp; Gamble in the early 2000s over their attempt to takeover the German shampoo company Wella. It took control of the Italian soccer club AC Milan after the previous owner defaulted on its debt.\nBut the firm\u2019s most recent buy may not be such a bad thing for the downtrodden office market.\nElliott and Mukang Cho\u2019s Morning Calm Management recently closed on the acquisition of an obscure REIT in a deal valued at $1.1 billion.\nThe company, City Office, is an oddity. It\u2019s headquartered in Vancouver and has employees there, but has no properties in Canada. Instead, it bought humdrum office buildings in the Sun Belt. It controlled 4.2 million square feet of office space, commanding a modest $34.89 in gross rent per square foot. Its stock price has been underwhelming, reaching a high of $21 in 2022. In the end, shareholders received just $7 per share, a 26 percent premium from its last day of trading.\nBut Elliott\u2019s move to acquire City Office (surely a winner of the most creative office company name contest) may be an early tell in the post-Covid real estate landscape: investors are circling again, a sign the market may finally be scraping the bottom.\nIndustry insiders have long predicted that big-money investors like Elliott would acquire troubled public real estate companies and take them private, betting on a mismatch between office landlords\u2019 stock prices and the underlying value of their assets in a market that had sharply discounted the sector.\nRecently, there have been a few notable deals. Rithm Capital bought Paramount Group, a troubled office landlord in NYC and San Francisco, led by a CEO who fancied lavish expenditures and lunches at Le Bernardin, in a $1.6 billion deal.\nOthers appear to be lining up. Franklin Street, a Massachusetts-based office REIT with 4.8 million square feet of office space in the Mountain West and the Sunbelt, is seeking suitors as its stock price fell beneath $1. Phoenix-based Orion Properties, which owns 8 million square feet of office, is exploring a sale after stopping a takeover attempt by Kawa Capital.\nResuscitating REITs is not for the faint of heart. The maneuvers take time, burn capital and leave little room for error.\n\u201cA potential buyer has to make the determination that, even with the share premium he will likely need to pay, the juice is worth the squeeze,\u201d said Mukang Cho, whose firm purchased CIty Office REIT with Elliott Management. \u201cMy sense is many buyers might see value [in taking REITs private], but are hesitant \u2013 somewhat understandably \u2013 to then take the next step,\u201d he said.\nStill, the opportunity is tempting. Let\u2019s look at Rithm\u2019s acquisition of Paramount.\nAccording to Rithm, Paramount\u2019s stock was trading at 40 percent discount to its book value. Furthermore, the $1.6 billion deal was a fraction of the $6.6 billion that Paramount valued its real estate at. By that math, Paramount sold for a song.\nRithm believes its acquisition could result in an impressive 20x internal rate of return.\nParamount\u2019s office towers may not be the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of NYC office stock, but they are 85 percent leased and commanding $90 per square foot. That\u2019s not exactly distressed pricing.\n\u201cThe overall entry point on the underlying assets at what we think are very, very attractive values,\u201d said Rithm CEO Michael Nierenberg in a call with analysts explaining the move.\nThe firm\u2019s executives also pointed to NYC\u2019s office market resurgence.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no new construction, 10 percent of the inventory is coming offline with the conversions. And the return to work phenomenon is back now 4 to 5 days a week,\u201d said another Rithm exec on the call.\nOf course, not all office market recoveries are experiencing the same upswing as NYC. The nationwide vacancy rate remains around 20 percent. Finding a deep-pocketed investor like Elliott or Rithm willing to write the checks required to pull off these deals remains difficult, and there are only a handful of office REITs trading.\nBut the job of the office landlord has vastly\nevolved\n. In NYC, if you bought in the core business district, made sure the lobbies and bathrooms were clean, you could land tenants. Many of these landlords weren\u2019t operators, they were investors who saw office as their investment vehicle. That\u2019s changed. Tenants are picky and seek out buildings with critical amenities like podcasting rooms or signature scents. Or maybe driving range simulators for those junior analysts who need to work on their short game.\nFor investors that can buy at a low enough basis, and put in the money to upgrade buildings, and hold on long enough to catch the market\u2019s resurgence, there\u2019s at least a chance of an outsized return.\n",

        "content": "A New York-based distressed mall buyer is expanding its Chicago office holdings, taking control of a Loop office building through a deed in lieu of foreclosure after scooping up its debt at a steep discount.\nA venture of\nKohan Retail Investment Group\nlate last week took title to the 28-story building at 33 West Monroe Street, wresting the property from an affiliate of New York-based AmTrust RE. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat Kohan CEO Mike Kohan confirmed the move, which followed the firm\u2019s purchase of a $60 million loan backed by the building last fall.\nThe 900,000-square-foot building, at the southeast corner of Monroe and Dearborn streets, is the latest prominent downtown office property to change hands via distress. Rather than slug it out in court, AmTrust\nhanded over the keys\n, a route increasingly favored by owners and lenders looking to avoid long foreclosure battles, according to the publication.\nKohan\ntook its first step toward ownership in November, when it bought the mortgage from a venture of Des Moines-based Principal Life Insurance. AmTrust had secured the debt in a 2011 refinancing, according to Cook County records. While Kohan declined to disclose what it paid for the loan, the outlet noted that the brokerage Transwestern reported in October that it was under contract for about $25 million.\nGreat Neck, New York-based Kohan, best known as a buyer of troubled malls and shopping centers, isn\u2019t an obvious office landlord. But Kohan told the outlet that the company plans to use its low cost to lure tenants with aggressive rents.\n\u201cWe are looking for tenants that didn\u2019t have the opportunity to be part of [the building at 33 West Monroe] to come forward,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will make a deal.\u201d\nThe building is about 44 percent leased, according to CoStar, well below the downtown average of roughly 72 percent. Built in 1981, it was once the headquarters of Arthur Andersen before the accounting firm\u2019s collapse in the early 2000s.\nThe Monroe Street acquisition follows Kohan\u2019s bargain buy last year of the 65-story tower at 311 South Wacker Drive for $45 million, a sliver of the $302 million that building fetched in 2014.\nFor AmTrust, the handoff adds to a rough stretch in Chicago. The firm has already lost the building at\n30 North LaSalle Street\nto foreclosure and is battling a foreclosure lawsuit tied to its $260 million Illinois Center mortgage. It has also flirted with surrendering the building at 135 South LaSalle Street before pivoting to an office-to-apartment plan under the city\u2019s LaSalle Street Reimagined program.\nWith high interest rates, sagging values and loans coming due, more Loop owners are facing similar choices. Just last month, Chicago-based Nuveen took control of the building at 321 North Clark Street to resolve a troubled loan.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "What began as a corruption case about favors for developers is veering into darker territory for Ingrid Lewis-Martin, once Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 closest political ally.\nCourt filings from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg allege Lewis-Martin accepted diamond earrings and other perks from developers while pressuring the Department of Buildings to push through hotel and nightlife projects, The City\nreported\n, even as senior DOB officials warned of unresolved safety issues.\nThe filings suggest her interventions may have overridden concerns about fire egress and occupancy at a Lower East Side hotel and a rooftop bar project.\nThe documents were filed Tuesday as prosecutors responded to motions by Lewis-Martin\u2019s lawyers seeking to dismiss the case. They add fresh allegations to two existing indictments that accuse Lewis-Martin of bribery and money laundering, alleging she abused her position as the mayor\u2019s chief advisor to make regulatory problems disappear for politically connected developers.\nAmong the latest claims, prosecutors say Lewis-Martin accepted a pair of two-carat diamond earrings worth about $3,000 from\ndevelopers Raizada \u201cPinky\u201d Vaid and Mayank Dwivedi\nat the start of the Adams administration. In return, she allegedly leaned on city agencies to fast-track approvals for projects including the Hotel Rivington and a rooftop bar called the Glass Ceiling.\nPotentially more explosive for City Hall and the real estate industry is the allegation that DOB officials internally raised red flags about safety. A top buildings official warned that the hotel renovation Lewis-Martin was pushing forward lacked critical information about occupancy load and whether the building had adequate fire egress, according to the filings.\nDespite those concerns, Lewis-Martin repeatedly pressed then-acting DOB Commissioner Kazimir Vilenchik to move the project along.\nEmails cited by prosecutors show DOB staff expressing unease that Lewis-Martin was trying to \u201ccircumvent the process.\u201d In one instance, after Lewis-Martin texted that a project needed to be moved forward, a new plan examiner was assigned within an hour. Permits soon followed.\nLewis-Martin resigned in December 2024, days before her\nfirst indictment was unsealed\n.\nProsecutors accused her of\nsteering $100,000\nfrom the same developers into a joint account she shared with her son, funds later used to buy a Porsche. Other alleged benefits include cash, free catering at Gracie Mansion events and a speaking role on the TV series \u201cGodfather of Harlem,\u201d tied to a separate scheme involving pressure on DOT over a contested bike lane.\nHer attorney, Arthur Aidala, dismissed Bragg\u2019s latest filing as overreach, calling it a \u201cdesperate\u201d response.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The pandemic-era slowdown in productions and 2023 actors\u2019 and writers\u2019 strikes, along with the increasing costs of production in Los Angeles, have driven away productions. Shoot days fell 16 percent last year compared to 2024, according to a forthcoming FilmLA report for 2025 cited by the Times.\nThe declining figures are a fall from grace from just a few years ago. In 2021, independent studio owner Hackman Capital Partners and Square Mile Capital Management bought Radford Studio Center in Studio City for nearly $1.9 billion. The owners defaulted on their $1.1 billion mortgage earlier this month, and lender Goldman Sachs is\nexpected to seize control\nof the studio lot.\nSome studio owners are hopeful that the state\u2019s expanded film tax credits, which grew last year to $750 million from $330 million, will be helpful in stimulating production growth and creating some \u201cgreen shoots\u201d for the industry, as Wainwright said. \u201cI would like to think that 2024 and 2025 are kind of the bottom and that we\u2019re going to be pulling ourselves up,\u201d he told the Times.\nIn the meantime, studio developers like East End have been improvising by\nlooking to adaptive reuse\nas a way of increasing studio space without initiating new construction projects. East End\u2019s new downtown campus is partially built at a former cold-storage facility, and Amazon turned buildings in downtown Culver City into its Culver Studios facility.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A national data center land developer is making a big first move into the Chicago region, scooping up hundreds of acres of farmland in Grundy County for a power-hungry campus that would rank among the largest in the Midwest.\nAn affiliate of Denver-based Tract acquired a 343-acre site off I-80 in Morris, Illinois, paying about $51.5 million to an affiliate of Clarius Partners, according to public records. Bisnow\nreported\nthat the property sits roughly 50 miles from Midway Airport and about 65 miles southwest of downtown Chicago, firmly in exurban territory but close enough to tap the region\u2019s fiber and power backbone.\nTract\nplans to develop the land into the Morris Technology Park, a 2.9 million-square-foot data center campus designed to support up to 1 gigawatt of power load. Initial energization is targeted for June 2028, with the full load ramping up by 2032, the company said in a press release.\nThe project has been several years in the making and required close coordination with the city of Morris, Commonwealth Edison and the Illinois Economic Development Corporation, according to Tract President Graham Williams. The work includes a transmission security agreement with ComEd, a critical step for any hyperscale-scale development, according to the statement.\nTract\u2019s business model is to buy raw land, lock down zoning and entitlements and then build out heavy infrastructure \u2014 power, fiber, roads, water and sewer \u2014 before selling sites to hyperscalers or other data center developers. The company typically spends between $100 million and $150 million per site to get land ready, Mayor Chris Brown told local station WCSJ last year, often courting tenants like Amazon, Google and Microsoft.\nCity officials approved the infrastructure plan last year, with most local leaders confident the grid could handle the demand. Supporters have pointed to improvements in data center efficiency and relatively low traffic impacts. Still, the project hasn\u2019t been without controversy. Morris Alderman Alex Clubb voted against it, raising concerns about water usage and the potential need for a new water facility that the city might have to help fund.\nBrown later said the city is in \u201cgood shape\u201d on water and is considering construction of a larger facility to support long-term growth.\nThe deal marks Tract\u2019s first Chicago-area play, adding the region to a national portfolio that includes more than 25 gigawatts of planned capacity across 25,000 acres in markets like\nArizona\n,\nTexas\n, Virginia and Iowa. Tract estimates the Morris campus would generate more than 1,000 construction jobs and about 350 permanent positions \u2014 a sizable boost for a city of roughly 14,600 people.\nThe Morris announcement outside of Chicagoland comes as suburban Chicago debates how much\ndata center development\nit wants.\nBarrington Hills Village officials announced on Monday that Brennan Investment Group withdrew its proposed $2 billion data center campus in Barrington Hills following \u201cnegative early feedback\u201d from village officials and organized community opposition, canceling a Feb. 2 public hearing.\nLast week, Naperville officials killed a far smaller 145,000-square-foot proposal from Karis Critical, citing concerns over power availability and long-term economic tradeoffs, and Lisle officials paused a proposed data center after residents packed Village Hall with objections.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Silva &amp; Associates is aiming to break ground this summer on a three-story, 42,400-square-foot office building at the intersection of Beltway 8 and U.S. Highway 288, pending city permits,\naccording\nto the Houston Business Journal. The building, dubbed \u201cLawplex,\u201d would rise on a 1.9-acre parcel the firm bought in February 2024 between a Holiday Inn Express &amp; Suites and Bombshells Restaurant &amp; Bar.\nJ.D. Silva launched just five years ago with two lawyers and two other employees. Today, it employs about 60 people, including 11 attorneys, said Ernest Rojas, the firm\u2019s director of corporate services.\nThe law firm initially planned to develop the building with Houston-based Z-Co, but that partnership fell apart. J.D. Silva is now working with Powers Brown Architecture, another Houston firm, and is currently soliciting bids for a general contractor, the outlet reported.\nDesign-wise, Lawplex is meant to stand out in\nPearland\n. Plans call for glass walls, staggered floor plates with the largest floor on top, a rooftop patio and a centrally located staircase that lights up at night. That modern look required some back-and-forth with city officials, Rojas told the publication, because it departs sharply from the area\u2019s more conventional suburban architecture.\nConstruction is expected to take 12 to 14 months. Once complete, J.D. Silva plans to occupy roughly 30,000 square feet of the building, leasing out the first floor to office or retail tenants.\nThe firm currently leases about 10,000 square feet in a building at 9307 Broadway Street that already bears its name, and has added smaller outposts in Angleton in Brazoria County and McAllen in the Rio Grande Valley as its caseload has expanded, according to the publication.\nThe future site puts the firm directly across Highway 288 from a nearly 100-acre tract that has repeatedly teased a massive mixed-use future. Houston-based\nNewQuest\nabandoned a $350 million development\nplanned\nthere in 2023, the second time a developer has walked away from the property.\n\u201cThe 288 corridor is getting denser, better demographics and more rooftops,\u201d\nPearland\nEconomic Development Corporation President Matt Buchanan told the Business Journal last year.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The facility at 619 West 14th Street is owned by Elevate Research Properties, a subsidiary of Taconic Partners.\nThe asking rent and length of lease were not disclosed; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai signed a lease two years ago for 10,000 square feet, when the asking rent was $100 per square foot.\nThat\u2019s slightly below today\u2019s rates. In the third quarter, the average asking rent for life sciences space across New York City was $105.40 per square foot, according to CBRE.\nIn a statement, the president of Jackson noted the importance of being in \u201cclose proximity to leading academic medical centers, industry partners and patients.\u201d\nJackson recently acquired the New York Stem Cell Foundation. Prior to the lease execution, which took place in late October, the space was leased to the NYSCF.\nTaconic purchased the 10-story office building at the site \u2014 formerly known as The Movie Lab Building because of Warner Bros. Pictures\u2019 occupancy \u2014 for $112 million in 2012. Five years later, Silverstein Properties\nbought a majority stake\n, valuing the property at more than $180 million, while Taconic retained a 10 percent interest.\nThe partners invested $20 million to revamp the building, aiming to bring in research and pharmaceutical tenants. The property represented Silverstein\u2019s first life sciences project.\nIn 2020, Silverstein and Taconic refinanced the property with $205 million from Affinius Capital, then known as Square Mile Capital.\nBut in 2023, Silverstein tapped Eastdil Secured\u2019s Gary Phillips and Will Silverman to\nmarket its interest\nin the Hudson Research Center. A buyer had the opportunity to either recapitalize and join up with Taconic or purchase the property outright in a fee simple sale.\nA few weeks ago, Affiinius acquired the stake from Silverstein, valuing the property at $191.7 million, according to\nPincusCo\n.

        "content": "A trust linked to Morris Flancbaum, the custom homebuilder husband of Conair heiress Susan Rizzuto, bought an oceanfront Hillsboro Beach mansion for $36.5 million.\nHis Land Banc Trust, managed by attorney Russell Macnow, bought the house at 1083 Hillsboro Mile from Deborah Tarrant.\u00a0 The house is next door to a home Flancbaum bought for $21.8 million in 2021, records show. It brings his total spend on the 3.7-acre assemblage to $58.3 million.\nJonathan Potsma with Coldwell Banker Realty represented the buyer and seller.\nFlancbaum is the head of New Jersey-based custom homebuilder Colts Neck Associates, which has developed homes in Marlboro, Colts Neck, North Howell, Brick, Manalapan, Millstone and Toms River, all in New Jersey. Susan Rizzuto is the daughter of Leandro P. Rizzuto, the late billionaire co-founder of hair products maker Conair. He was worth $3.5 billion when he died in 2017, according to Forbes.\nShe is a trustee of her father\u2019s namesake foundation along with her siblings, Leandro Rizzuto Jr., Denis Rizzuto and Babe Rizzuto. In 2024, Leandro Rizzuto Jr. bought a home in Boca Raton\u2019s Royal Palm Yacht &amp; Country Club for\n$18.5 million\n. Babe Rizzuto bought an oceanfront compound in Jupiter Inlet Colony for\n$35 million\nin 2022, and she listed it for $55.6 million in 2023 but had no luck finding a buyer.\nFlancbaum and Susan Rizzuto have invested in other South Florida homes. In 2021, they sold a Boca Raton mansion for\n$22 million\n.\nTarrant is the widow of early healthcare tech mogul Richard Tarrant. He sold his firm, IDX Systems, to GE Healthcare for $1.2 billion in 2005, according to published reports. The couple bought the Hillsboro Mile mansion for $3 million in 1998, property records show. The 11,000-square-foot house includes eight bedrooms, eight bathrooms, five half-bathrooms, 200 feet of oceanfront and 200 feet of Intracoastal Waterway frontage with a dock, the listing shows.\nDeborah Tarrant downsized to a home in Royal Palm Yacht &amp; Country Club for $8.4 million in November, records show.The sale marks the latest uber-expensive home sale in Hillsboro Beach, a sleepy stretch of coast just north of Pompano Beach. Earlier this month, car dealer Craig Zinn bought a waterfront mansion in the area for\n$27 million\n. In August, former Advanta CEO Dennis Alter sold his oceanfront mansion for\n$27.1 million\n.",

        "content": "Chicagoland\u2019s most expensive home listing took a $2.5 million price cut this week, more than a year after it first hit the market.\nThe 15,000-square-foot mansion at 595 Circle Lane in Lake Forest, on the grounds of a historic estate, had its price cut to $25 million on Tuesday. The six-bedroom, nine bathroom estate was listed at\n$27.5 million in September 2024\n, and has been on and off the market a few times at the same price.\nEven with the 9 percent price cut, the home remains the priciest active listing in the Chicago metro area, surpassing an $18.5 million Gold Coast mansion on Dearborn Street. The asking price would make it easily the most expensive home ever sold in Lake Forest.\nThe Italianate-style mansion sits on a 5.3-acre lot with 570 feet of Lake Michigan frontage and includes a boathouse, swimming pool and spa. The property also has a garage complex with space for 22 cars.\nThe home is owned by Terry Rozdolsky, according to property records. Rozdolsky founded Lake Forest-based Harbortown Industries, a wholesale supplier of picture frames for retailers like Walmart and Target.\nRozdolsky purchased the site in 2010 for $4.5 million, property records show. He built the current mansion in 2019 after tearing down the existing home. Rozdolsky paid about $171,000 in property taxes in 2025, county records show.\nAnn Lyon, the @properties agent representing the seller, did not respond to a request for comment.\nOne of the estate\u2019s unique features is a grand staircase descending the bluff to the lake, a remnant of the Villa Turicum estate that once occupied the site.\nThe 269-acre Villa Turicum estate was established in the early 20th century by Harold McCormick\u00a0 \u2014 son of International Harvester founder Cyrus McCormick \u2014 and Edith Rockefeller McCormick, the daughter of John D. Rockefeller. The opulent 44-room home, designed by architect Charles Platt, fell into disrepair after Rockefeller McCormick\u2019s death in 1932, and it was eventually demolished, with the land split up into 161 separate lots.\nThe latest price cut comes after North Shore homes reached unprecedented price levels in 2025. Two homes in Winnetka each\nsold for more than $30 million last fall\n, marking the most expensive home resales in Illinois history.\nLake Forest has seen some eight-figure deals recently, as well. An 11,800-square-foot mansion sold for $11 million in October. The home was sold by the\nestate of Posy Krehbiel\n, a Lake Forest socialite and philanthropist and the ex-wife of John Krehbiel Jr., the co-chairman of electronics company Molex.\nIn 2022, the\nwidow of filmmaker John Hughes\nsold a Lake Forest home for nearly $13 million.\nIn Chicago, other luxury homes cut prices this month, as the downtown market continues to adjust after a long downturn. A duplex condo at 950 North Michigan Avenue was relisted on Monday at $5.5 million after previously asking $6 million. The 9,000-square-foot home hit the market in September and is being marketed by Ryan Preuett and Tim Salm of Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\nAt the St. Regis Chicago at 363 East Wacker Drive, a 4,700-square-foot unit, also listed by Preuett, took a $450,000 price cut in early January. The owner is now asking $6 million for the condo.\n",

        "content": "A judge rejected\na bid by SL Green and RXR\nto stop a UCC sale tied to Worldwide Plaza, clearing the way for Extell to move ahead with a foreclosure auction.\nJudge Andrea Masley denied the landlords\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction that would have blocked a UCC foreclosure sale of the mezzanine loan secured by the 49-story office tower at 825 Eighth Avenue, according to a decision issued on Tuesday in state Supreme Court.\nThe dispute pits three of New York\u2019s biggest real estate players against one another: SL Green\u2019s Marc Holliday, RXR\u2019s Scott Rechler and Extell\u2019s Gary Barnett. SL Green and RXR are the current owners of Worldwide Plaza. Extell, meanwhile, quietly acquired the senior mezzanine debt on the 1.8 million-square-foot office complex this fall.\n\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed in the most recent ruling, however, we still own and control the asset and we believe we will ultimately reach a resolution with the mezz lender which meets all parties\u2019 objectives,\u201d an SL Green spokesperson said.\nThe ruling came after the landlords sued to block the sale, arguing it was a \u201csham\u201d designed to wrest control of the Midtown property without a fair, competitive process. The firms claimed the proposed auction was structured to chill bidding and steer the asset to Barnett.\nExtell\npushed back hard\nagainst the allegations, calling RXR and SL Green\u2019s lawsuit meritless and accusing the two developers of trying to derail a sale they have known about for months. Barnett\u2019s camp argued in a legal filing that the mezzanine lender is within its rights to foreclose after a default and that the auction was properly noticed and structured.\nThe judge ultimately sided with Barnett, emphasizing in her ruling that contracts must generally be enforced, especially when negotiated by \u201csophisticated, counseled businesspeople,\u201d even if market conditions have changed since the deal was struck.\nGoldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank provided $190 million of senior mezzanine debt in 2017 that was later transferred to Korea-based Shinhan Financial Group, which sold it to Extell.\nWorldwide Plaza has been a prime example of the office market\u2019s continued distress. Control of the mezzanine debt would give the winning bidder significant leverage over the property\u2019s future.\nThe property is backed\nby $940 million in senior CMBS debt\nthat\nwent to special servicing\nin September 2024 after law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore vacated 617,000 square feet, leaving Worldwide Plaza about 40 percent vacant. The landlords defaulted on both senior and mezzanine debt in July, per public filings.\nExtell is the only qualified bidder lined up for the auction, but Masley said that does not render the sale commercially unreasonable.\n\u201cOur position on Worldwide Plaza has long been clear \u2014 while we moved the asset into our Alternative Strategy Portfolio over two years ago given that we attribute little to no value to the asset, we have a plan to revitalize the building and the capital to execute it,\u201d the SL Green spokesperson said.\nAn Extell representative declined to comment. RXR did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "Anthony Donato is fast becoming the\nbaron of Bannockburn\nthrough purchases of troubled real estate.\nThe resident of the wealthy suburban Chicago enclave in the North Shore paid $20 million this week to buy the 114-acre former Trinity International University campus, he confirmed to\nThe Real Deal\n. It marks a significant discount from a previous deal\nTexas real estate titan Ross Perot Jr. eyed\nfor the property before backing away.\nDonato and his wife Anna\u2019s nonprofit foundation acquired the sprawling North Shore site featuring 26 buildings just months after another of his ventures snapped up the nearby Bannockburn Lakes office park for $17 million. The office park\u2019s price amounted to a painful haircut for the sellers, Chicago-based\ncommercial real estate heavy hitters Walton Street Capital and Glenstar\n, after they spent $43 million between 2015 and last year buying and upgrading the property.\nPerot Jr.\u2019s Dallas-based firm, Hillwood, had considered buying the Trinity property for years, with plans to pay about $35 million for most of the land and embark upon commercial redevelopment that could have brought industrial, office, lab or other corporate uses to the campus.\nAccording to a person familiar with the deal, Hillwood was interested in redeveloping the land for Takeda Pharmaceuticals, which has a large office space in an adjacent Bannockburn property. But Hillwood walked away after sensing community resistance to the plan, and\nTakeda this month opted to expand a separate lease\nit has in a Libertyville corporate campus by about 80,000 square feet.\nAfter shuttering its residential and in-person education operations in Bannockburn in recent years, Trinity was still in a rush to find a buyer. The school had a $16 million bridge loan against the property it took out in late 2024 from Connecticut-based lender JGB Management.\nThe Donatos leveraged their home field advantage to secure the site in a sprint, closing the deal in just seven weeks. They financed the purchase with a bank loan, they said, but declined to name the lender or the loan amount. Hillwood declined to comment.\nUnlike Hillwood\u2019s commercial ambitions, the Donatos pitch a vision that might be more well-received by village residents: a massive youth and amateur sports complex. The centerpiece will be a 300,000-square-foot to 400,000-square-foot indoor arena they are planning to build to replace the campus\u2019 Meyer Sports Complex. It will feature multiple basketball courts, volleyball and indoor soccer facilities, and perhaps an ice arena for hockey and other skating-based competition. The property already includes full-size outdoor football, baseball and softball fields the Donatos intend to use as part of their programming. They said they expect the addition to cost another $40 million to $50 million and think they could break ground within 18 months, while preparing to gain village approval for the project.\nThey also want to bring other entertainment concepts to the property, such as golf simulators and perhaps mini-golf, arcades, escape rooms and more, and see opportunities to host summer camps and corporate retreats that could make use of the property\u2019s commercial kitchen and cafeteria that can feed 1,000 people per meal.\nThey\u2019re toying with the idea of building a higher-end hotel on the property, as well, and capitalizing on the property\u2019s proximity to multiple major highways by adding retail uses, such as restaurants and shops that would be fueled by traffic from families and athletes attending sporting events.\n\u201cWe could truly hold a tournament here every weekend,\u201d Anna Donato said. Their oldest of three children, an 11-year-old daughter, has also given them a list with dozens of ideas for the property, they said. They hope to have sports leagues running at the property as soon as this spring.\nThe Donatos previously expressed interest in buying at least a portion of the Trinity campus for their vision, but were unable to make a deal while Hillwood was still in the mix. The couple purchased the Bannockburn Lakes office complex in July with plans to turn some of that five-building campus spanning 530,000 square feet of interior space into an athletics-focused complex. Now, one of the Bannockburn Lakes buildings will be converted into self-storage or temperature-controlled storage uses. The Donatos are also trying to lease up much of the vacant office space at the property, hiring JLL last year to market it to potential tenants.\n\u201cThere\u2019s endless things you could put here,\u201d Anthony Donato said of the Trinity property. \u201cAll the sports-oriented stuff, I call that the anchor that drives its own version of traffic, where you\u2019re going to have thousands of kids come every weekend.\u201d\nHe found success in the solar power development field while also gaining some experience with multifamily and retail real estate. The Bannockburn Lakes and Trinity deals are his largest office and development plays, however.\nThe couple\u2019s plan coincidentally could have some synergy with the\nChicago Red Stars\n. The professional women\u2019s soccer team earlier this month announced plans to build a $30 million-plus training performance center on an adjacent Bannockburn parcel, creating a de facto sports district in the suburb. The Donatos weren\u2019t aware the Red Stars were keen on the area when they put out their offer for Trinity.\nTrinity International confirmed the sale to a \u201cprivate real estate investment entity\u201d in a statement, but declined to comment on the religious school\u2019s financial situation. Trinity controlled the property for over 60 years, but faced declining enrollment in suburban Chicago, and last year announced it was merging with Trinity Western University in British Columbia, Canada. Its shutdown of most of the campus \u2014 with several buildings that have stayed open, including its library and chapel \u2014 was originally planned in 2023.\nFor Donato, the deal cements a rapid accumulation of more than 150 acres of prime North Shore land at bargain-basement pricing. By targeting property that institutional capital has either fled or failed to unlock, he\u2019s betting as a local operator, he can navigate the zoning and political dynamics that scared off out-of-towners.\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with the village to get permission to do everything,\u201d Anthony Donato said. \u201cBig goals to hit the ground running as fast as we can.\u201d\n",

The structures are at 2101 Webster Street, 1901 Harrison Street and 2100 Franklin Street.\nStarwood Capital\nowned the buildings prior to the\nlender takeover\n. The unpaid debt for the three office buildings totals $442.1 million, according to filings cited by the Mercury News. The original loan Deutsche Bank provided to Starwood totaled $364.5 million, per Alameda County real estate records.\nStarwood bought the office buildings in 2019 for a total of $494 million. At the time, the purchase was seen as a vote of confidence in the Oakland office market. The Covid-19 pandemic that broke out the following year sent\noffice values\nin San Francisco and across the Bay Area spiraling, leading to bargain-basement sales and foreclosures in the region.\nWhen Starwood bought the buildings, the\noffice vacancy rate in downtown Oakland\nwas approximately 7.5 percent, according to a Colliers report cited by the Mercury News. Today, nearly six years after the outbreak of the pandemic, the vacancy rate has not gotten close to recovering. In the fourth quarter of last year, the office vacancy rate in downtown Oakland was 28.5 percent, according to Colliers.\nThe 2101 Webster building rises 20 stories and spans 473,000 square feet. The 1901 Harrison structure is 17 stories tall with 285,000 square feet, and 2100 Franklin is 10 stories with 217,000 square feet. The three office buildings total 975,000 square feet, according to the Mercury News. Because the properties are on separate parcels, the Deutsche Bank affiliate could offload the buildings in individual transactions should it choose to sell them.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A Silicon Valley\nquantum computing\ncompany will move its headquarters to Boca Raton, bolstering Palm Beach County boosters\u2019 drive to turn the area into a hub for tech firms.\nD-Wave Quantum, now based in Palo Alto, California, will open its headquarters and a research and development facility by year\u2019s end at the Boca Raton Innovation Campus, according to news releases from the tenant and landlords. D-Wave leased about 25,000 square feet, according to a CP Group spokesperson.\nFounded in 1999 and taken public in 2022, D-Wave provides dual-platform quantum computing. Alan Baratz is CEO.\nD-Wave signed a $20 million agreement with Florida Atlantic University for the school to purchase an Advantage2 annealing quantum computer, and to have it installed at its Boca Raton campus. After the deal was announced Tuesday, D-Wave\u2019s stock rose 1.6 percent, Investor\u2019s Business Daily\nreported\n.\nAlso on Tuesday, D-Wave announced a collaboration with Davidson Technologies and defense tech firm Anduril Industries to develop quantum applications for U.S. air and missile defense.\nBoca Raton-based CP Group and New York-based DRA Advisors own the 1.7 million-square-foot Boca Raton Innovation Campus, or\nBRiC\n, at 5000 T-Rex Avenue. The campus was developed in the 1960s by IBM for its research and development.\nDRA, led by David Luski, paid\n$320.2 million\nfor a stake in BRiC in 2021. CP Group is led by Angelo Bianco and Chris Eachus.\nThe firms recently completed a $100 million capital improvement of the campus.\nD-Wave\u2019s move from Silicon Valley to Boca Raton boosts the narrative that South Florida has a growing tech industry supporting real estate leasing. The excitement picked up at the onset of the pandemic when Silicon Valley firms rushed to the tri-county region, which had reopened for business and hosted the 2020 bitcoin conference. At the time, much of the industry excitement was over Miami\u2019s Wynwood, which was a magnet for the techies.\nAs a whole, data showed the influx of tech companies\ndidn\u2019t translate\nto hefty office leasing in South Florida. And over the past three years, some of the South Florida firms moved back to Silicon Valley, especially since the area is considered the biggest ecosystem for AI, the latest fad in tech.\nBut over the past year, there\u2019s been a renewed push to grow the tech industry but in a different South Florida area: Palm Beach County, and especially the city of West Palm Beach. The drive is\nled by billionaire Steve Ross\nand other executives at Related Ross, the West Palm-based real estate firm Ross founded in 2024.\nAt Related Ross\u2019 23-story 10 City Place building, under construction in downtown West Palm, Fortune 500 cloud computing firm ServiceNow pre-leased\n211,900 square feet\n. It marked last year\u2019s\ntop\nSouth Florida office lease.\u00a0Vanderbilt University is expected to start construction soon for its\n$520 million\nWest Palm campus that will offer business and tech graduate programs. Ross and other real estate heavyweights played a pivotal role in helping bring the Nashville-based university to West Palm, with Ross committing $50 million in April, hosting fundraisers and advocating publicly for the campus.\n",

        "content": "A big piece of Los Angeles history made waves last week as the top home to go into contract.\nThe historic Dorothy Chandler Estate at 455 Lorraine Boulevard in Los Angeles\u2019 Hancock Park topped a report of signed contracts from Douglas Elliman\u2019s\nEklund Gomes\nteam. The\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n, compiled by the team\u2019s Marcy Roth, counts Los Angeles County homes listed in the Multiple Listing Service for $4 million or more.\nThe estate is currently asking $12.9 million, or $1,381 per square foot.\nBuilt in 1913, the\nhome\nwas designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument, with its ties to Los Angeles Times owners Norman Chandler and Dorothy Buffum Chandler. The Chandlers, who bought the property in 1950, referred to the home as \u201cLos Tiempos,\u201d or The Times in Spanish.\nIts other name as the \u201cWestern White House\u201d comes from the parade of presidents \u2014 including Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon \u2014 along with diplomats and other high-profile individuals welcomed as guests at the estate. The Los Angeles Music Center, which includes the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, in Downtown Los Angeles was built with the help of fundraisers held at the Hancock Park residence.\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\u2019s Shahryar Bastani and Beverly and Company\u2019s Shiva Rafizadeh hold the listing.\nCurrent sellers, Nigerian furniture manufacturer Robert Oshodin and his wife Mimie Oshodin, acquired the property for $9.5 million in 2014 to, according to property records. About two years later they\nmarketed the home for $50 million\nfollowing several renovations.\nFit for entertaining, the Beaux Arts-style home has six bedrooms, eight bathrooms, music room, guest house and wine cellar. It sits on nearly 1 acre.\nLast week\u2019s second-largest home to go into contract, based on asking price, was 1150 Stone Canyon Road in Bel-Air.\nThe property, which sits above the Hotel Bel-Air, is priced at just under $8 million, or $1,525 per square foot. With an over 3-acre lot, it\u2019s being marketed for its development possibility.\nThe lot currently holds an over 5,000-square-foot home with six beds and six baths.\nCompass\u2019 Sally Forster Jones holds the listing.\nRecords show the property owner is a trust tied to the artist Vivian Angelini.\nOverall, Los Angeles County was mostly quiet last week when it came to dealmaking with a dozen homes entering into contract, equating to a little over $75 million in asking volume, according to the Eklund Gomes\nreport\n. That\u2019s off about 75 percent from the year-ago total volume.\n",

The new offices will be in the southern annex on a block that once was home to the headquarters of the Los Angeles Times and known as Times-Mirror Square.\nGSA\u2019s space spans a number of floors in Onni Group\u2019s 145 South Spring Street, and the largest federal defender office in the U.S. will move into the space in the first quarter of 2027.\nThe GSA liked the property \u201cdue to its proximity to courthouses, landlord\u2019s ability to fund and perform tenant improvements, and overall competitive economics on the lease,\u201d JLL\u2019s Peter Hajimihalis said. Lease details weren\u2019t immediately available.\nHajimihalis and JLL colleagues James Malone, Dana Vargas and Howard Traul represented Onni in the deal along with Onni Group\u2019s in-house leasing team of Neal Linthicum and Malcolm Kluth. Timothy Pavek at Carpenter/Robbins Commercial Real Estate worked on behalf of GSA.\nFederal Public Defenders Central District of California will be relocating from 321 East 2nd Street in the Little Tokyo part of DTLA.\nDeveloper Onni Group, headquartered in Vancouver, acquired the 10-story, 243,749-square-foot 145 South Spring Street in September 2016 for $105 million, per property records. The structure is a historical part of the Times-Mirror Square four-building office complex. The building was integral to the LA Times\u2019 operations for 70 years until the company relocated in 2018.\nThe publication has a small fraction of the staff and revenue it commanded at its heights. It sold off Times-Mirror Square under prior ownership and now is located in El Segundo at a building in the portfolio of current owner Patrick Soon-Shiong.\nOnni has been investing in Downtown L.A. in recent years,\nerecting Olympic + Hill\nrental tower with 685 units and 45,000 square feet of amenity space at 230 West Olympic Boulevard.\nIts other DTLA office assets include two buildings in South Park: the 12-story, 159,561-square-foot 315 West 9th Street and the five-story, 69,700-square-foot 1212 South Flower Street. It also owns the 17-story, 311,300-square-foot 600 Wilshire Boulevard in the Financial District.\n",

The company has grown rapidly since going public in June 2020: It now has 32,000 agents, almost triple its agent base of 12,000 that it\nreported\nat the end of 2023. In 2024,\nthe company added over $23 billion in transaction volume\n, second in growth only to\nCompass\n, according to RealTrends.

The team completed over $163 million in volume that year with an average home price of $702,000.\nKeller Williams has recognized Paige Martin as a top five individual agent in the franchise. She also chairs the Houston Association of Realtors MLS Committee.\nBob Martin cited Real Brokerage\u2019s focus on technology as a draw for the Houston Properties Team, according to the press release.\nNeither Paige Martin nor Real Brokerage immediately responded to a request for comment.\nThe team\u2019s move takes place as established companies weigh the benefits of branding and resources against independence. While the Compass/Anywhere merger consolidated\nsome of the top brands in Texas\nunder one company, others have doubled down on local management.\nKeller Williams recently lost the Jorgenson Group, a Central Texas team that opted to go independent earlier this month.

Business First reported. The company will occupy 9,480 square feet at 811 West 7th Street once it moves operations from its office in\nVenice\nat 215 Rose Avenue. The firm\u2019s headquarters are in Oakland and opted to\nrebrand\nfrom Guayak\u00ed last May to Yerba Madre, or \u201cMother Herb,\u201d to reflect \u201ca deepened commitment to people and planet, and the ancestral roots of yerba mate,\u201d the company said.\nThe Fine Arts Building was built in 1926 and spans 115,902 square feet across 13 stories. The structure was designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1974.\nYerba Madre\u2019s \u201cdecision to relocate from Venice to Downtown Los Angeles reflects the area\u2019s strengthening market fundamentals and the growing appeal of occupying creative space in a truly distinctive environment,\u201d said NAI Capital Commercial\u2019s Gibran Begum, who represented Fine Arts Building landlord Manchester Capital Management in the lease transaction.\nRecent office sales in Downtown Los Angeles indicate the market might have a long way to go before reaching pre-pandemic levels.\nNew York-based investment company 601W has emerged as a buyer for a distressed office tower on Bunker Hill in downtown Los Angeles. The Brookfield-owned Wells Fargo Center\u2019s North Tower, rising 54 stories and spanning 1.4 million square feet, is reportedly set to trade hands for $180 million,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported. That price works out to about $130 per square foot. Last month, another distressed\nBrookfield\n-owned downtown office tower, the\nBank of America Plaza\n, hit the market. The 57-story tower was last appraised at $212.5 million, or about $150 per square foot, in 2024 \u2014 a stark contrast from its $605 million value a decade ago.\nOther office deals that signal a possible positive trend in the downtown market seem to be few and far between.\nLast month, L.A. Metro bought the 106,004-square-foot office building at 500 South Santa Fe Avenue in the Arts District from SteelWave for $45 million. The $450 per-square-foot sales price dwarfs the downtown office average of $240 per square foot and the $342 per square foot average across Greater Los Angeles.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The portal is designed to cut down on the time it takes for developers to begin construction on\nstate-owned surplus property\n, according to the California Department of General Services.\n\u201cBy modernizing how we engage with developers, California is unlocking new opportunities for job creation and economic growth,\u201d Ana Lasso, director of the Department of General Services, said. \u201cThis portal ensures that state land is put to its best use while supporting diverse and emerging developers across the state.\u201d\nThrough the portal, developers can submit proposals to the Department of General Services, which the agency then evaluates according to the state\u2019s goals for the sites, which \u201cinclude successful implementation of the plan, financial return to the state and local regional impact,\u201d a department spokesperson told the Bee. Once a plan is approved, the developer would be responsible for building what they proposed if they\u2019re chosen.\nThe administration of\nGov. Gavin Newsom\nhas been working to turn government properties into affordable housing or other commercial properties. When Newsom first took office in 2019, one of his first announcements was a proposal to address California\u2019s need for more affordable housing by converting state property\nto residences\n. Last year, Newsom said his administration had 32 projects in \u201cvarious phases of development\u201d that would eventually result in nearly 4,300 housing units.\nLast November, state officials announced six new projects across California where more than 800 new homes will be built on state land. The new portal lets developers peruse the state\u2019s commercial opportunities.\nAs of Monday, 19 state properties were listed for possible commercial development, according to the Bee. Of the 19, 15 are available for proposal and one is already under agreement. Under the new program, developers will deal with simpler submission requirements and the Department of General Services can review proposals on a rolling basis, permitting projects to advance more quickly.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A year after succumbing to a massive loss on the sale of a marquee Chicago River office building, Sterling Bay is looking to offload a parking garage across the street as a potential apartment development site.\nThe Chicago-based developer hired JLL to market the five-story parking structure at 530 West Chicago Avenue, pitching the site as an apartment development opportunity amid intensifying interest along the river, according to a marketing brochure. JLL broker Dan Reynolds is representing the seller, CoStar\nreported\n.\nThe garage sits just north of the Loop and spans about 30,725 square feet. JLL is advertising the site as suitable for a mid-rise or high-rise apartment project with as many as 400 units, depending on how much density a buyer can unlock through zoning and negotiations with neighboring owners.\nSterling Bay\nbought the garage in August 2018 for $15.5 million, Cook County records show. The decision to sell comes almost exactly a year after the firm unloaded the hulking office building at\n600 West Chicago Avenue\nfor about $88.7 million \u2014 a steep discount from the roughly $510 million it paid in early 2018 for the 1.6 million-square-foot\nformer Montgomery Ward warehouse\n, according to CoStar and public records.\nThe garage sale price will likely hinge on development rights. Under an existing reciprocal easement agreement with the adjacent garage at 811 North Larrabee Street \u2014 now owned by Arizona-based 3Edgewood after its purchase of the 600 West Chicago building \u2014 a buyer could build a 67-unit apartment building as-of-right. JLL\u2019s marketing materials note that changes to that agreement could allow a 175-unit tower under current zoning, while further negotiations could clear the way for a building with up to 400 apartments.\nAny project at 530 West Chicago Avenue would land in a rapidly transforming pocket of River North. Bally\u2019s casino is rising just across the river, while Onni Group is planning thousands of apartments nearby on and around a former Greyhound bus facility at the south end of Goose Island.\nThe listing also highlights the continued reshaping of Sterling Bay\u2019s portfolio after losing control of the\nLincoln Yards\nmegadevelopment and putting other properties in Fulton Market and near Lincoln Yards on the block.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Nearly two years after the condo board at a Chicago high-rise terminated an agreement to sell their building to deconversion specialists Strategic Properties of North America, the firm came back with another offer \u2014 and was met with a resounding no.\nAfter buying dozens of condos in the 310-unit building in the Loop, SPNA offered $95 million to purchase all of the remaining units in a bulk sale in 2022. The Lakewood, New Jersey-based company, led by Saul Kupperwasser and Yitzy Klor, has made a name for itself in the high-stakes business of converting condo buildings into rental apartments.\nUnit owners at 200 North Dearborn Street initially agreed to the bulk sale to SPNA, but the firm failed to secure the financing necessary to close the deal, and condo owners were left in limbo for over two years. While the sale was pending, they were barred from selling their units individually, according to their agreement.\nThe condo board voted to terminate the contract in May 2024.\nWhen news of the second offer spread this week, the condo building\u2019s Facebook page lit up with condo owners criticizing SPNA.\n\u201cThis is absolutely ridiculous. We cannot seriously go through this again,\u201d one member of the Facebook page wrote.\nThe deal was swiftly shot down.\nThe 200 North Dearborn condo board voted 4-0 to reject the offer, condo president Jonathan Taylor confirmed to\nThe Real Deal\n, though he declined to disclose the amount offered.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t as good as the offer that we were under contract for last time,\u201d he said.\nAccording to the condo board\u2019s bylaws, the board was tasked with evaluating the likelihood that fellow condo owners would support the offer in a building-wide vote. If the board was confident that the offer could get some traction, regardless of board members\u2019 individual opinions on the potential deal, they would agree to pay attorneys to draft a contract to present to all the condo owners for a vote, Taylor said. But after evaluating the terms of the offer, the board agreed it was likely to fail.\n\u201cWhat is wrong with them?\u201d another commenter on the Facebook page said, referring to SPNA. \u201cIf there are people who want to sell their units, do it when they get a good price \u2026. Leave the rest of us out of this slimy deconversion deal.\u201d\nKupperwasser and Klor did not respond to requests for comment.\nSPNA has successfully converted condo buildings in Chicago to rentals in the past. The cyclical business thrives when the condo market is oversupplied, and rent is on the rise.\nYet, since 2020, SPNA has fumbled three Chicago conversion deals, including the two offers to buy all the remaining units at 200 North Dearborn Street.\nThe third failed deal was\na $190 million offer\nto buy a River North condo building called Ontario Place. Initially, the building\u2019s condo board also agreed to the bulk sale. But after SPNA failed repeatedly over three years to secure the funding necessary to close the purchase, the board backed out of the deal. At the time, one condo owner called the waiting game, \u201chell for the past three years.\u201d\nAfter SPNA\u2019s first offer to buy all the units at 200 North Dearborn, tension escalated between condo owners who wanted to sell to SPNA and those who wanted to cut ties with the company, resulting in\na contentious condo board election\nin late 2023.\nIt also spurred\na lawsuit from\nTaylor, who alleged that SPNA had committed consumer fraud by making an offer it couldn\u2019t support. The case is currently pending in Illinois appeals court.\nSPNA\u2019s failed condo deconversions aren\u2019t the only setbacks the firm is facing.\nAttorneys for Chicago-based Byline Bank this month\nfiled a foreclosure complaint against SPNA\nfor a promissory note that has allegedly been in default since August.\nByline alleges that the bank issued a $496,000 note to Kupperwasser and Klor in 2017, but in August they stopped making payments. Byline alleges the duo currently owe $340,000 on the loan.\nAround the same time that the pair took out the promissory note, they also secured a $397,000 mortgage from Byline on their one-story, 5,400-square-foot Illinois office property at 5009 Oakton Street in Skokie.\nByline is now requesting that a judge order a judicial sale of the building to pay back the note.\nSPNA also recently sold a converted apartment building in Chicago at a loss, while listing another for sale.\nLaramar Group bought SPNA\u2019s Wave Lakeview apartments for $57 million last month. SPNA last refinanced the property for $62 million in 2019, public records show. SPNA had converted the nearly 60-year-old building from condos to apartments in 2017 and took out a $46 million loan from Ladder Capital to help fund the deconversion, according to public records.\nIt\u2019s unclear how much total capital SPNA put into the deconversion of the 30-story, 207-unit Wave Lakeview at 420 West Belmont Avenue, or if the company paid down the principal on its latest $62 million note from MF1 before selling the property.\nIn October, the company\nalso listed the K Square Apartments\nin Lincoln Park. SPNA converted the 22-story, 268-unit property from condos to rentals in 2018, and listed the building for sale in 2023 with CBRE, before eventually taking it off the market. It is now listed with Berkadia brokers Nick Harris, Pete Evans and Richard Evans.",

        "content": "A federal civil rights investigation launched by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development into whether Texas state officials steered federal disaster relief grants to whiter, wealthier areas is now over.\nHUD\nclosed the case\ninvestigating the Texas General Land Office\u2019s practices in its distribution of disaster funding, according to a press release Wednesday from HUD. According to the agency, HUD\u2019s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity found that the Texas GLO did not engage in racial discrimination when making grant awards.\nThe move is the latest in a tug-of-war on policy spanning across three presidential terms to the present day. Former President Joe Biden\nreinstated a fair housing rule\nthat was scrapped by the Trump administration during his first term.\n\u201cThe Biden administration politicized enforcement of federal civil rights law and deprived rural communities of essential disaster mitigation funds,\u201d HUD Secretary\nScott Turner\nsaid in a statement. Turner was a Plano, Texas-based pastor prior to his confirmation in February for the HUD secretary chair.\nThe findings contradict the initial 2022 probe, which found that Texas didn\u2019t allocate any of the $1 billion in federal funds it received to protect communities from future disasters to any of the high-risk neighborhoods in Houston that experience regular flooding, as previously reported in\nThe Real Deal,\nwith the agency going on to state that excluding Black and Hispanic communities was discriminatory.\nThe focus on Houston began with Hurricane Harvey recovery efforts in 2017 and several costly storms in the following years that inundated the city. No other state adopted Texas\u2019 method of distributing the funds, according to the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity under the prior administration. Without Texas\u2019 discriminatory criteria, nearly four times as many Black residents and more than twice as many Hispanic residents would have benefited from the grants, according to the agency.\nThe state denied claims of discrimination and appealed HUD\u2019s findings, arguing that the Texas General Land Office administered the federal grant program based on HUD approval. The state pointed out that its plan was approved two years ago and even called HUD\u2019s objections \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201d\nTurner agreed, publishing an op-ed in the magazine National Review Jan. 19, outlining a new rule proposed by the agency to drop use of \u201cdisparate-impact theory\u201d in fair housing cases. According to a Library of Congress definition published in 2025,\ndisparate-impact\ndiscrimination is identified \u201cwhen a seemingly neutral policy or action causes a disproportionate and unjustified negative harm to a group, regardless of intent.\u201d\nHUD\u2019s statement reiterated that in the Texas GLO case, the state agency effectively used a race-neutral competition standard for disaster mitigation projects.\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s not the\nworst landlords\nlist. It\u2019s the\nworst\nlandlords list.\nWhat makes this annual hit piece by Public Advocate Jumaane Williams so bad? To begin with, not everyone on the list is a landlord.\nSome of them are\nreceivers\n\u2014 people appointed by a judge to rescue violation-ridden buildings. People like Joe Cafiero.\nThis is supposed to be a list of villains, but Cafiero is anything but. He arrives at a property with a pile of money from the lender, which is trying to protect its collateral, gets to know the residents and spends what it takes to fix what\u2019s broken.\n\u201cI walk every building,\u201d he said. \u201cTenants know my name. They have my cell number. They love me. We\u2019re doing what the owner didn\u2019t do. We\u2019re making it habitable again.\u201d\nWhen Cafiero is handed control of a building, it might have six or eight violations per unit. Violations are the basis of the public advocate\u2019s notorious list. But instead of shaming the owner who did not fix the problems, Williams\u2019 list blames people trying to do exactly that.\nThe list deemed Cafiero the landlord of\n19 distressed buildings\n. A random check of one, 1202 Spofford Avenue in the Bronx, showed it actually belonged to Isaac Kassirer, who famously assembled a huge rent-stabilized portfolio only to see the 2019 rent reform\ndestroy his business plan\n.\nThe building\u2019s $14.7 million mortgage included two other buildings, both assigned to Cafiero by a judge. The\nthree Kassirer properties\ntotal 106 units and 961 HPD violations, which Williams\u2019 list laid at the feet of Cafiero. Rather than using ACRIS, the city\u2019s property records database, the public advocate linked to\nJustFix.org\n, which partners with\ntenant organizing groups\n.\nDistress rising\nAs various factors pushed apartment buildings into\nfinancial straits\n, business skyrocketed for Cafiero, who has been at his firm, Cremac,\nsince 1994\n.\n\u201cWe take over two to four buildings a week,\u201d he said. \u201cLast year it was one every month, or every other month.\u201d\nAs a result, his ranking on the worst list of landlords shot up. No good deed goes unpunished.\n\u201cI was [No.] 24 last year; I\u2019m up to 4,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s only because the volume of foreclosures has increased.\u201d\nThat, and the fact that the public advocate does not bother to differentiate between landlords and receivers.\nSometimes, as in the case of distinguished former judge\nAriel Belen\n, No. 34 on the list, clicking through to the associated properties shows he is a receiver, not the owner. Williams apparently did not even do that rudimentary check.\nThe public advocate\u2019s staff goes through the motions of informing people in advance that they will make the list, but does not appear to listen to feedback.\n\u201cThey sent us a letter about two months ago,\u201d Cafiero said. \u201cI replied, told them we don\u2019t own [the buildings], that we\u2019re under receiver orders, but I guess it went ignored.\u201d\nProtests ignored\nCafiero said he even called the public advocate several times before the \u201cworst landlords\u201d list was released. But it generates more publicity than anything else the powerless office does, so each public advocate picks it up from the previous one. Before Jumaane Williams, there was Letitia James and the list\u2019s creator, Bill de Blasio.\n\u201cI\u2019m a New Yorker, I get it,\u201d Cafiero, a St. John\u2019s graduate, said of Williams. \u201cHe\u2019s grandstanding.\u201d\nWhen the list was released, media outlets started calling Cafiero, but no real estate publications did. They know better.\nThe Real Deal\nstopped covering the list years ago because it unfairly included owners who had just purchased troubled buildings and were in the process of fixing them up.\nNow it is increasingly roping in receivers because rent-stabilized buildings have been hit by a perfect storm:\nthe Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, which virtually banned deregulation and severely limited rent increases for improvements;\noperating expenses\noutpacing rent increases\nby the Rent Guidelines Board;\nrising interest rates starting in March 2022; and\na\ndecline in rent collection\ntriggered by the pandemic.\nThe \u201cworst landlords\u201d list is supposed to shame owners who squeeze profits from their buildings by not spending enough on maintenance. But it does not differentiate between them and owners who try hard to maintain properties, even if they lose money in the process.\nBecause of the rent laws, regulations and the dysfunction of housing court, the ownership costs of fully rent-stabilized buildings often exceed their revenue. Even mission-driven nonprofits that don\u2019t have to pay property tax are struggling at some properties.\n\u201cI\u2019ve literally lost $1.5 million for the honor of being a \u2018worst landlord,\u2019\u201d one member of the list said. \u201cIf I had to have the indignity of being on the list, I\u2019d at least want to make a buck.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Gabriel Barbier-Mueller\u2019s Harwood International sold off another office building, amid a wave of\nsales\nand\nforeclosures\nat the firm\u2019s signature Uptown district.\nHarwood offloaded Harwood No. 3 to San Francisco-based private equity firm TPG on Dec. 1, deed records show. It\u2019s the fifth property\nHarwood sold to TPG\nin the last six months.\nHarwood No. 3, at 2727 North Harwood Street, was built in 1999. It\u2019s anchored by law firm Jones Day, which occupies 133,000 square feet of the 210,000-square-foot office building. Jones Day was supposed to anchor the upcoming Harwood No. 15, with plans to move into a\n73,000-square-foot block\n, but\npulled out of the project\nlate last year.\nAfter tapping Newmark to\nhunt for a recapitalization partner\n, Harwood sold four buildings to TPG last fall: Harwood No. 2, at 2728 North Harwood Street; Harwood No. 6 (also known as Saint Ann Court), at 2501 North Harwood Street; Harwood No. 7 (also known as Frost Tower), at 2950 North Harwood Street; and Harwood No. 10, at 2850 North Harwood Street.\nThe sales to TPG coincide with a spate of foreclosures in the district that resulted in Harwood losing two office buildings.\nHarwood handed back the keys to\nHarwood No. 4\nin April and lost\nHarwood No. 1\nin November. San Francisco-based Spear Street Capital took back Harwood No. 4, at 2828 North Harwood Street, in a $73 million credit bid.\nFirst United Bank seized\nHarwood\u2019s first development, at 2651 North Harwood Street, with a $27 million credit bid. Bill Cawley\u2019s\nCawley Partners bought the property\non Dec. 30.\nHarwood\nnearly lost Harwood No.6\nto foreclosure in January, but saved the building, known as Saint Ann Court, with a recapitalization deal.\nThe financial unraveling of Harwood is at odds with the health of the office market in Uptown. Though Dallas-Fort Worth continues to struggle with\nhigh vacancy rates\n, Uptown has been a reliable outlier. With a high concentration of trophy office properties, the sought-after submarket accounts for nearly half of the region\u2019s office pipeline. Consequently, it also boasts the highest rents of any submarket in Dallas-Fort Worth, with an overall average gross rent of $62.21 per square foot, according to a recent report from Partners Real Estate.\n",

In 2016, his team ranked first in\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s annual broker rankings after closing over\n$720 million\nin sell-side deals. The team claims over $5.2 billion in sales since its inception, CEO Bess Freedman wrote in an announcement about the move.\nThe team works on both resale and new development projects. Past projects have included 108 Leonard, 111 Murray and 150 Charles. Recent noteworthy deals have included resales in those buildings, including a penthouse at\n111 Murray\nsold for $28 million in July and a condo at 150 Charles that sold for roughly $16 million this month.\nDe Niro\u2019s team also has the listing on another penthouse at 111 Murray asking over $33 million.\nHe also worked with his father, actor Robert De Niro, on expanding the family\u2019s real estate holdings. The younger De Niro was a partner and helped open the boutique Greenwich Hotel in Tribeca in 2008, and has been a part of the expansion of the upscale restaurant Nobu. Last year, the De Niros opened their\n775,000-square-foot production studio\nin Queens.\nDe Niro said in a statement he felt \u201cit was time to take my business in a new and different direction\u201d after 20 years at Elliman.\n\u201cWe are proud of the agent Raphael became with Elliman and wish him nothing but the best in his next endeavor,\u201d a spokesperson for Elliman said in a statement.\nDe Niro is the latest in a long line of big-name Elliman agents who have left the firm.\nEarlier this month,\nLindsay Barton Barrett\n, one of the top brokers in Brooklyn, brought her four-person team to Compass. Top-producing teammates\nNoble Black\nand\nGlenn Davis\nparted ways with Elliman and each other last fall when Black left for Corcoran and Davis headed to Serhant.\nThe moves come as Elliman shuffles senior staff as well. The brokerage parted ways this month with its\nhead of residential leasing\n, Hal Gavzie, and last month, it laid off\nfour senior employees\n, including two members of its new development marketing arm.\nThe high-profile agents from Elliman have largely landed at Compass and Corcoran, but De Niro will be joining a fellow Elliman veteran at BHS. New York City agent\nJessica Cohen\nleft the firm in April after roughly 20 years for BHS.\n",

El-Ad also assumed a $4.5 million mortgage with a 2028 maturity date.\nEl-Ad\npaid more than double the sale price from three years ago. The seller, an entity managed by Luis Navas in Fort Lauderdale, paid $7.7 million in 2023, records show. Last year, North Bay Village city officials approved a transfer of development rights from the 7922 East Drive lot to the other two lots. El-Ad has not disclosed plans for the three lots.\nIn May, El-Ad bought a 1-acre vacant parcel at 7913 West Drive for\n$20 million\nfrom Aventura-based S2 Development. In 2023, North Bay Village approved S2 Development\u2019s plan for Marina View tower, a 22-story tower with 94 residential units as condos or apartments.\nEl-Ad, a division of New York-based Elad Group, has built 12,222 apartments and condo units in the Southeast, including 4,370 in Florida, according to the firm\u2019s website.\nIn Davie, El-Ad is planning a\n$1 billion\nmixed-use project. The 2.8 million-square-foot District in Davie will entail 1,256 apartments in five towers ranging from 20 stories to 24 stories, as well as 36,000 square feet of retail and restaurants, and 2,650 parking spaces.\nNorth Bay Village is a hotbed for high-rise development.\nAlirio Torrealba\u2019s Coral Gables-based MG Developer and Miami-based Prosper Group filed plans last month for a 30-story tower with 147 condo units at 1681 and\n1725 North Bay Causeway\n. The joint venture paid\n$30.9 million\nfor the 1-acre site last year.\nCoconut Grove-based Related Group and New York-based Macklowe Properties are planning a two-tower condo project with 364 units at 8000 East Drive and 7946 East Drive that could be branded as\nRitz-Carlton\n.",

        "content": "JEMB Realty is forging ahead with its revival of a Midtown shopping corridor, convincing TJ Maxx to sign its first new lease in Manhattan in a decade.\nThe big-box retailer agreed to lease 40,000 square feet at Herald Towers in Herald Square, the New York Post\nreported\n. The store will occupy two floors of the property at 50 West 34th Street and is expected to open by the end of the year, representing the retailer\u2019s eighth Manhattan location.\nThe asking rent on the 10-year lease was a blended $4 million, according to the\nCommercial Observer\n. In the fourth quarter, the average ground-floor retail asking rent on West 34th Street was $405 per square foot, according to CBRE.\nJEMB\u2019s Jacob Jerome told the Observer that the deal reinforces \u201cthe corridor\u2019s role as one of the most important shopping districts in the country.\u201d\nRipco Real Estate\u2019s Richard Skulnik represented the tenant, while JEMB was represented in-house.\nThe lease brings occupancy at Herald Towers to 95 percent. Other tenants at the 110,000-square-foot property include Old Navy, MooMoo and IT Italian Trattoria.\nOld Navy, Gap Inc.\u2019s largest brand, agreed last spring to create a\n55,000-square-foot flagship\non the first and second floors of Herald Towers, the largest retail lease of the year in Manhattan at the time. The asking rent on the 15-year lease was not disclosed at the time.\nHerald Square has been slow to recover compared to other Manhattan retail corridors like SoHo and prime Fifth Avenue. The area along 34th Street between Fifth and Seventh avenues sported 21 ground-floor retail vacancies during the first quarter of last year, according to CBRE, the second-most among the 16 districts tracked by the brokerage.\nHerald Towers was once the McAlpin Hotel, but was rebranded after JEMB purchased the property in 1999 for $150 million. The property also includes 690 apartments, where a studio is asking $3,500 per month.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Long-stalled plans for nearly 1,000 residential units plus hotel rooms and commercial space near a West Palm Beach transit hub are back in motion.\nAttorneys for the developers behind the $1 billion Transit Village project are in discussions to settle the lawsuit against Palm Beach County over the sale price of the 6.6-acre county-owned site, avoiding a February trial, the Palm Beach Post\nreported\n.\nCourt filings point to Palm Beach County Administrator Joseph Abruzzo, appointed last year to the job, for helping thaw the stalemate over the sale. The opposing sides \u201cbegan working together in good faith to try to amicably resolve this matter,\u201d the developers\u2019 attorneys wrote in filings.\nThe Toledano family\u2019s Aventura-based BH Group, the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Coconut Grove-based Related Group and Michael Masanoff plan the 1.3 million-square-foot Transit Village at 150 Clearwater Drive in downtown West Palm. The project would rise atop a major city bus station and next to a transit hub for Tri-Rail and Amtrak trains and Greyhound buses.\nTransit Village had been in the works for 15 years when Masanoff won a city solicitation to redevelop the property. After stalling for years, it finally\npicked up momentum\nin 2021 when Related, BH and Sagi invested in the project.\nIn 2022, West Palm\napproved\nthe development with three 25-story buildings with 986 residential units, a fourth 25-story building with 108 hotel keys, and 180,000 square feet of offices. The project will include micro-units, workforce housing units, retail and an elevated podium.\nBut then Transit Village hit another hurdle when the developers\nsued\nthe county in 2024 over jacking up the site\u2019s price to $35.5 million, nearly 10 times more than the $3.6 million agreed on in 2012.\nIn court filings, the county said it wanted nearly $3 million in Federal Transit Administration grants repaid. But the county said the FTA wanted it repaid based on current property market values that put the amount owed for the grants at $35.5 million. Transit Village has argued the FTA never asked for the money back and the county contract never included a requirement to pay back the federal agency.\nReasons for previous delays prior to BH, Related and Sagi\u2019s investment are unclear. A source previously told\nThe Real Deal\nit had to do with numerous amendments to agreements with government agencies due to plan changes.\nAttorneys for the developers and a county spokesperson declined to comment to the outlet.\nA settlement would require approval at a public county meeting.\n\u2013\u2013\nLidia Dinkova\n",

The asking price was later reduced to $7.8 million before being taken off the market in October, according to listing sites.\nMostame said after a relatively quiet 2025, he\u2019s seeing signs of \u201cactivity picking up\u201d and expects the property to trade before the summer now that buyers are back from their holiday travels.\nThe big jump in pricing from when the home last sold to London interior designer Julia Dempster is due to the extensive renovation it underwent. Dempster sought to retain the 1920s Spanish influence with the home\u2019s original arched doorways, stained glass windows and hand-painted ceilings, according to Mostame.\nIt sits on nearly a third of an acre and has six bedrooms and seven bathrooms across 5,906 square feet.\nThe residence was made a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1999, not only for its Spanish Colonial Revival architecture, but its high-profile ownership lineage. That most recently came with Barker\u2019s purchase of the property in 1969. However, it was also once owned by former\nLos Angeles Times\nPublisher Harrison Gray Otis and later Charles Toberman, who is credited with building out Hollywood via developments such as the Hollywood Bowl, Grauman\u2019s Chinese Theatre, El Capitan Theatre and the Roosevelt Hotel among other landmarks.\nToberman is also the developer of the\nOutpost Estates\nneighborhood, an exclusive community of less than 500 homes known for its Spanish and Mediterranean designs. It\u2019s bordered by Mulholland Drive and Runyon Canyon.\n",

The decision puts OYO on the hook for legal fees in the dispute, which could fall in the six-figure range when determined next week.\nThe judge pulled no punches in finding OYO in contempt for firing the property\u2019s manager and dozens of unionized employees, despite\nan order\nnot to do so.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know what more you could do to be in contempt. I really don\u2019t,\u201d New York state Supreme Court Judge Andrea Masley said. \u201cThis is contempt if I ever saw it.\u201d\nThe judge also admonished OYO for not adhering to a contract that dictated how the company and Highgate would go their separate ways.\nOYO did not respond to a request for comment about the contempt finding or the dispute with Highgate.\nIn early August, OYO allegedly blindsided the property manager Highgate with a notice canceling its contract, according to a lawsuit filed by Highgate. The cancellation attempt came four years ahead of schedule and included the citation of issues related to an entirely different property Highgate operates.\nThe 10-year management agreement entitled Highgate to a 3.25 percent cut of the 208-key hotel\u2019s gross revenue. OYO is supposed to provide working capital to the property, which Highgate described as \u201cwell-performing.\u201d\nOYO disagreed with Highgate\u2019s characterization of performance in the termination notice. The hotel owner said it plans to welcome a new property manager, though at the moment, that property manager appears to be OYO.\nTerminating Highgate\u2019s contract could be a way for OYO to cut expenses and boost earnings before an expected initial public offering.\nOYO,\nbacked by SoftBank\n, bought Motel 6 from Blackstone for $525 million and is preparing an IPO that could value the company at $8 billion.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Alexandria is expected to\nput its 88 Bluxome Street site in San Francisco on the market\nin the first half of the year. The company has also begun marketing sites near Stanford University in Palo Alto for housing and is expected to sell the land within the next year.\nAlexandria saw almost $1.9 billion in write-downs last year, marking a nearly tenfold increase from 2024. With heightened surplus supply across the Bay Area, many developers are shying away from building new life sciences projects after the pre-pandemic biotech boom. Vacancy is approximately 24 percent, according to Savills data cited by the Business Times.\nLeasing in the life sciences market is picking up steam and some demand remains, according to the Business Times. Alexandria executives believe\nrecovery is coming\n, but it isn\u2019t moving fast enough to absorb excess supply. Rather than bet on life sciences, buyers for surplus land are instead looking to acquire property at lower prices and plan for housing instead.\nAn increasing portion of Alexandria\u2019s land and aging properties are now being positioned for housing upon sale, Peter Moglia, Alexandria\u2019s CEO and CIO, said. Much of Alexandria\u2019s recent write-downs were linked to land, a direct result of oversupply in the Bay Area and other parts of the country, Marc Binda, Alexandria\u2019s CFO noted.\nSome Alexandria-owned land is being primed for housing without even selling. Last month, Strada Investment Group unveiled a\nproposal to demolish\nfour office buildings on Alexandria-owned land in Palo Alto to make way for 145 residential units.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Four years after topping out Brooklyn\u2019s office skyline, JEMB Realty pulled off a financial reset at 1 Willoughby Square, bringing in partners and refinancing a tangle of construction-era debt to keep control of the 35-story tower.\nThe 500,000-square-foot Downtown Brooklyn building was recapitalized through a complex transaction that included new equity, splitting the tower into condos and a $125 million mortgage from Deutsche Bank, according to\nBisnow\nand a recent Fitch Ratings report.\nAmong the latest round of investors is Edmond Safra, a member of the Safra banking family, alongside Adnane Mousannif\u2019s AVRS Partners and KSR Capital principals Abraham Kassin and Morris Sabbagh.\nThe Deutsche loan is tied to the lower portion of the building and includes a $75 million A-note sold into a CMBS conduit. JEMB executives Joseph, Morris, Jacob and Louis Jerome are listed as sponsors on the financing, along with the new partners.\nThe sponsors also kicked in $68.5 million in fresh equity, according to Fitch, used largely to retire $179.5 million of existing debt, cover closing costs and seed a nearly $10 million reserve.\nAs part of the deal, the tower was split into two condo units: floors one through 21 and floors 22 through 35. Only the lower unit carries the Deutsche debt, while the upper floors are debt-free for now. Fitch flagged the layered capital stack as a potential risk, noting remaining EB-5 mezzanine debt and $65 million in convertible loans tied to the joint venture.\nJEMB said the building is being repositioned with a spec suite program, including prebuilt offices as large as 10,000 square feet. The landlord recently signed CorePower Yoga to a 5,000-square-foot flagship retail lease on the ground floor and expanded Rubenstein Law into a 10,000-square-foot office on the 21st floor.\nThe recap comes against a tough backdrop for Brooklyn offices.\nDowntown Brooklyn\u2019s vacancy rate stood at 21.1 percent at the end of the third quarter, well above the citywide average, Fitch reported. The Willoughby Square tower is 53.5 percent occupied, though the portion tied to the CMBS loan is nearly full, anchored by the city\u2019s Albee Square Montessori Public School, which leases 86,000 square feet.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Mark Nussbaum, a disgraced Manhattan attorney and real estate fixer, said in new legal filings that he diverted $336 million from his law firm\u2019s escrow clients to real estate investor Mendel Steiner between 2022 and 2025.\nThe filings reveal the inner workings of Nussbaum and Steiner\u2019s alleged Ponzi scheme, where some creditors were offered \u201cfictitious investment opportunities regarding supposed proof of funds transactions or purchases of real property that did not really exist,\u201d said Nussbaum.\n\u201cPhony emails, escrow agreements, and deal documentation were used; non-existent third-parties in whose names the deals were supposedly being done were invented,\u201d the filings state.\nNussbaum said that most of his escrow clients, who are now creditors of Nussbaum\u2019s estate, were introduced to him by Steiner, who died by suicide at a hotel in Manhattan in January 2025 as the alleged scheme was about to spill into public view. Nussbaum Lowinger shut down days later and lawsuits started piling up from escrow clients demanding their money back.\nShelden Eisenberger, the lawyer handling the liquidation process \u2014 known as assignment for the benefit of creditors \u2014 of Nussbaum\u2019s former law firms, Nussbaum Lowinger and Mark J Nussbaum &amp; Associates, is zeroing in on the transfers to Steiner\u2019s family in an attempt to recoup the hundreds of millions owed to Nussbaum\u2019s creditors.\nThe new filings paint the clearest picture to date of the money flow between Nussbaum and Steiner and his family. Nussbaum said he directly transferred about $24 million to Steiner or to companies controlled by members of his family.\nIn addition to direct transfers, Nussbaum transferred escrow money to Steiner\u2019s companies Aven Realty and Real Green Management. Those companies then transferred at least $68 million to companies controlled by Steiner\u2019s father, brother and wife, according to Eisenberger.\nTo compensate Nussbaum for his role in the scheme, Aven Realty and Real Green sent $104 million, according to Eisenberger\u2019s affirmation.\nEisenberger said he does not yet have access to all of Aven Realty and Real Green\u2019s books and records. But his legal team has been able to document some transfers.\nThis includes $4.3 million to DS Lending, a company owned by Steiner\u2019s wife Dini Endzweig Steiner; $361,500 to Olivii, a clothing company owned by Dini; $6.4 million to 365 12th Avenue LLC, a company owned by Steiner\u2019s brother Naftali; and $6.7 million to 198 President Realty LLC, another company owned by Naftali Steiner.\nEisenberger is seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent Aven Realty or Real Green from transferring any assets.\nHe notes recovery efforts are on behalf of 52 creditors of Nussbaum\u2019s who lost a significant amount of money as a result of the alleged ponzi scheme.\n\u201cSome of those creditors are themselves threatened with insolvency as a result of those losses,\u201d said Eisenberger in his affirmation. \u201cThis is a very important case and this is an urgent matter.\u201d\nThe filings also explicitly lay out how Nussbaum and Steiner\u2019s Ponzi\nscheme\nworked. Nussbaum and Steiner pitched three types of investments to possible investors. One offered clients high monthly fees in exchange for deposits into Nussbaum Lowinger escrow accounts. The money was supposed to be held in escrow but was instead used by Steiner to\nshow\nlenders or sellers that he was capitalized. The second method was through fraudulent real estate purchases, where Steiner provided Nussbaum\u2019s clients a chance to finance his real estate acquisitions or deposit. The third was by offering clients a chance to deposit money for a short-time in exchange for \u201cexorbitant interest and fees.\u201d The money was supposed to be used for \u201cshow capital\u201d transactions. Instead, Nussbaum used the money to make\nbridge loans\nto real estate dealmakers.\n",

        "content": "Texas homebuyers love master-planned communities so much that 20 of the 50 top-sellers were in the state in 2025.\nThe Houston region dominated the national ranking in particular, with Sunterra and Tamarron \u2014 both in Katy \u2014 landing in the top 10, according to data from real estate consultancy RCLCO. Houston\u2019s suburbs had 10 master-planned communities land in the 50 top-selling MPCs in total last year. Developers Land Tejas and Starwood Land\u2019s\nSunterra\nnotched the highest sales in the state with 1,024 last year. D.R. Horton\u2019s Tamarron inked 974 home sales.\nBuilders competed with a rising supply of resale homes, and many buyers remained sidelined by elevated mortgage rates,\naccording\nto the Houston Chronicle. Despite the broader trend,\ngains were posted\nin several developments across the Houston metro. Across the state as a whole, the only other state to come close to Texas\u2019 tally of top-performing master-planned communities was Florida, with 16.\nSunterra\u2019s 2,300 acres includes resort-style amenities that might serve as the extra incentive attracting new residents, such as a\ncrystal lagoon\nthat opened last year along a 2.7-acre white sand manmade beach, according to the outlet. Resident-only perks also include a pool and lazy river, splash pad and walking trails, all within zoning for Katy Independent School District and parts in Royal ISD.\nTodd LaRue, a Texas-based managing director at RCLCO, told the outlet that he expects Houston\u2019s master-planned communities to outperform the rest of the U.S. in 2026.\n\u201cIt is unlikely to be dethroned as the \u2018Top-Selling Metro Area\u2019 for master-planned communities in the near future,\u201d LaRue said.\nNot to be outdone,\nOxland Group\u2019s\nPainted Tree development in McKinney was the top Dallas-Fort Worth metro MPC to land on the list, with 643 home sales. The development, 30 miles north of Dallas and west of I-75, includes three districts surrounding wooded lakes and parks. In Denton County, D.R. Horton\u2019s Silverado development, at 2604 O\u2019Connell Circle in Aubrey, sold 446 homes, according to the data.\nRounding out the Texas Triangle, the San Antonio community of Riverstone \u2014 another D.R. Horton development \u2014 sold 529 homes. Riverstone is near the Far West Side Alamo Ranch and Loop 1604 Hwy 151 corridor. Platform Ventures and Capitol Realty\u2019s master-planned community of Santa Rita Ranch just north of Austin in Liberty Hill sold 483 homes, according to RCLCO.\n",

We could also see a new version emerge. Before the latest version was passed by the City Council in December, the bill\u2019s applicability was narrowed. Will a resurrected COPA apply to a bigger pool of buildings, now that it has an ally in the mayor?\nEither way, the fight over this bill isn\u2019t over. The city\u2019s Law Department flagged legal concerns with the latest version of the measure, and landlord groups have already floated litigation if the bill ultimately becomes law.\nIn a statement, Ann Korchak, board president of the Small Property Owners of New York, reiterated her group\u2019s opposition to the measure, calling it an \u201cunlawful taking of private property.\u201d\n\u201cThankfully, enough Council members understood the devastating ramifications of COPA and eliminated any possibility of the Council overriding the former Mayor\u2019s veto,\u201d she said.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: I\u2019ve asked this before, but still would love an answer: Who will the mayor select to lead the Department of City Planning? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Yume Kitasei, the\nnew head of the Department of Citywide Administrative Services\n, has two cats named Boondoggle and Filibuster, according to her\nauthor page\n. These are the best cat names I have ever heard, and I will not be persuaded otherwise.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Mayor Zohran Mamdani on Wednesday blamed his predecessor and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo for what his administration estimated is a $12 billion budget gap,\nGothamist reports\n. He ramped up his calls to increase income taxes on the city\u2019s highest earners (which would require state legislation). Representatives for the former mayor and governor disputed the mayor\u2019s claims.\n\u2014 Construction on the $16 billion Gateway tunnel project will screech to a halt in February if the Trump administration doesn\u2019t release funding,\nPolitico New York reports\n. The Gateway Development Commission has kept construction going, up until this point, thanks to a $500 million line of credit from Bank of America that is running out.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$19.8 million\nfor a condominium unit at 730 Fifth Avenue. The condo unit at The Aman is 3,400 square feet. The property was reportedly sold by\nthe developer\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$112.3 million\nfor 250 East Houston Street. Atlas Capital Group\npurchased\nthe 130-unit, multifamily building from Rockwood Capital.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $8 million for a penthouse unit at 456 West 19th Street. The Chelsea condo is 2,800 square feet.\nCompass\u2019\nJustin Hopwood, Adrian Radomski and Nicholas Lounsbury are the listing agents.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 171,415-square-foot, eight-story, mixed-use building at 1111 Myrtle Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Hamish Whitefield of Hamish Whitefield Architects is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "A Long Island investor who leaned on pandemic-era stopgaps to keep Midtown hotels afloat has now lost both properties.\nParamdeep Singh, who owns gas stations and operated the hotels through Premier Hotels, was stripped of control\nat 59 West 46th Street\nand 129 West 46th Street after defaults, foreclosure actions and investor infighting, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nAt 59 West 46th Street, a nine-story, 234-room hotel just off Sixth Avenue, Singh was undone by a former partner-turned-lender. Boris Aronov, a cab driver who later became a Diamond District diamond dealer, acquired the building\u2019s distressed mortgage last summer and then moved to foreclose when Singh failed to repay the debt by the end of the year. Court filings show the obligation had swelled to $57 million.\nThe deed, recorded last week, pegs the property\u2019s value at roughly $53 million, below the $59.5 million Singh\u2019s group paid for the hotel in 2022 when it bought it from Apple Core. That acquisition was heavily leveraged with more than $32 million in debt.\nOnce a budget-brand flag, the hotel more recently functioned as supportive housing under a nonprofit lease that is expected to remain in place.\nAronov is also eyeing a different future for part of the building: the property spans through to 47th Street, where he plans to bring in diamond merchants, extending his jewelry-focused portfolio in the neighborhood.\nSingh tried to stop the takeover in court, accusing Aronov of bad-faith tactics and arguing that international trade policies \u2014 Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 scuttled a last-minute refinancing. The effort failed.\nA few doors east, Singh\u2019s grip recently loosened at 129 West 46th Street, a 79-room prewar hotel he bought in 2019 for $24 million. When tourism collapsed, Singh pivoted the building into a city-contracted migrant shelter, generating steady cash flow but complicating long-term repositioning.\nA\nplanned revival\nwith hotel operator LuxUrban fizzled and the operator\u2019s bankruptcy cleared the way for foreclosure. A judge entered a $21.6 million judgment last fall and the property sold at auction this month to bridge lender W Financial for $23.8 million.\nInvestor lawsuits accusing Singh of mismanagement and opaque finances added pressure behind the scenes. Singh did not comment on the loss of the hotels.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The developer is also offering residents shuttle services to the beach, boating and the airport, the project\u2019s website shows.\nThe developer has not yet announced pricing for the units. Shelton has not confirmed a timeline for launching sales or starting construction.\nIt marks the developer\u2019s first project in the U.S. Shelton\u2019s portfolio includes developments in Ankara and Bodrum in Turkey, and its three completed developments are all single-family residential communities.\nWhile the real estate boom has spread across the broader Miami metropolitan region and drawn billions of dollars in investment, North Miami hasn\u2019t had the same pull on condo developers as other enclaves. But the tide is turning.\nIn November, the Eichner family\u2019s Continuum Company completed its buyout of a waterfront condo building in the city for\n$48.5 million\n. The firm previously\nsecured approval\nfor a 22-story, 267-unit project on the site, but the Eichners have yet to release details for their site plans.\nAcross the water, Bay Harbor Islands has a packed pipeline of condos in the works.\nOne Sotheby\u2019s International Realty took over sales and marketing of 9900 West,\nHorizon Group\u2019s planned 23-unit condominium\nin Bay Harbor Islands, in December.

County city, the Los Angeles Daily News reported. The property is valued at $7.4 million, per auction documents.\nManning Beef closed last October after filing for bankruptcy in 2024.

        "content": "A Bucktown strip mall could soon give way to a mid-rise apartment building, as a longtime local owner moves to redevelop a prominent stretch of Milwaukee Avenue.\nBroker-developer\nBill Senne\nintroduced a zoning change request to Chicago City Council for a seven-story, 60-unit apartment building at 1704 North Milwaukee Avenue, replacing a low-rise shopping center he has owned for decades, Block Club Chicago\nreported\n. The proposal calls for ground-floor retail, two levels of parking and apartments above.\nThe site currently houses a Garfield\u2019s Beverage Express liquor store and a CorePower Yoga studio, along with a surface parking lot across the street from the\nBucktown\n-Wicker Park library. Under the latest plans, the new building would include nearly 11,000 square feet of retail space along\nMilwaukee Avenue\n. Both tenants have expressed interest in returning after construction, according to Senne.\nPlans submitted to the city show 60 apartments spread across the upper floors, including a mix of one-, two- and three-bedroom units, plus two studios. Twelve apartments would be designated affordable to comply with city requirements. A two-level parking garage on the second and third floors would provide 67 spaces, with 12 reserved for residents and the remainder available as paid public parking.\nThe parking count is down sharply from earlier iterations. According to the publication, Senne, president of Chicago-based brokerage\nProperty Consultants Realty\n, and his team first presented the project to neighbors in early September, when plans called for roughly 100 spaces. Since then, the development has added two units and trimmed parking, though the building\u2019s exterior design has stayed the same.\n\u201cThe changes we made prior to filing are reflected on the floor plans, but the building\u2019s exterior elevations and massing stayed the same,\u201d zoning attorney Nicholas Ftikas said in an email to the outlet.\nThe zoning change was formally introduced to the City Council last week. It still needs approval from the Council\u2019s Committee on Zoning, Landmarks and Building Standards, followed by a vote of the full council. The timing is uncertain: The zoning committee hasn\u2019t met since December as aldermen jockey to become its permanent chair, as previously reported by\nThe Real Deal\n, and a February meeting has yet to be scheduled.\nCommunity reaction has been mostly supportive, according to the outlet, based on meetings hosted by the Wicker Park Committee and Bucktown Community Organization last fall. Some residents raised concerns about the building\u2019s height and potential traffic impacts on Wabansia Avenue and nearby streets.\nSenne has argued the parking garage would help replace spaces lost when protected bike lanes were added to Milwaukee Avenue. According to Block Club, Senne told neighbors in September that he was framing the garage as both a business necessity and a neighborhood amenity.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Alan Stalcup says collapsing multifamily fundamentals \u2014 not alleged fraud \u2014 are to blame for a string of failed investments by the syndicator that have landed his firm in court.\nStalcup, CEO of Austin-based apartment investor and operator GVA Property Management, pushed back in an\ninterview\nwith the Austin Business Journal on claims made by Austin-based investor Bryan Kastleman, who has accused GVA and its leadership of falsifying financials and\nsiphoning money\nfor personal use. Kastleman said he invested $11.3 million across several GVA deals and alleges the firm\n\u201ccooked the books\u201d\nto obtain and refinance loans, according to a lawsuit filed last year. GVA and Stalcup have denied the allegations and countersued Kastleman for defamation and business disparagement, among other claims.\nStalcup is also named in a lawsuit from New York-based private lender Benefit Street Partners in February 2025, and in January the Securities and Exchange Commission announced an investigation alleging he misappropriated as much as\n$100 million from investors\n.\nWith the suits and countersuits gearing up in court, Stalcup is publicly laying out a different explanation for GVA\u2019s unraveling: a brutal mix of rising interest rates, inflation and a wave of new apartment supply that crushed values across the Sun Belt, according to the publication.\nFrom the early 2010s through the pandemic, GVA\u2019s strategy of buying older apartment complexes, renovating them and boosting rents worked, Stalcup told the outlet. That changed around 2022, when the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates aggressively while simultaneously valuations in some markets fell by as much as 40 percent.\n\u201cNot only do the valuations go down, but debt service went up, and we\u2019re fighting costs of inflation, labor, property tax and insurance,\u201d Stalcup said. \u201cThen supply really kicked in in 2023 and 2024.\u201d\nThe oversupply problem in markets such as Austin is well documented. Patton Jones, vice chairman of Newmark\u2019s Central Texas office, told the outlet that the region entered 2024 with roughly 50,000 units in the development pipeline after years of pandemic-fueled in-migration to Sun Belt cities. That surge drove rents down just as borrowing costs spiked, a one-two punch for leveraged apartment owners.\nThose conditions, Stalcup said, hit GVA especially hard because of timing. The firm bought roughly $4 billion worth of real estate, with about 80 percent of the portfolio acquired post-pandemic, characterizing his firm\u2019s purchases of older apartments as all underwater.\nGVA defaulted on multiple loans in San Antonio, including at\nSolara\n, Bella Madera and Melia Apartment Homes, and sold other properties below assessed values. The firm also shrank the total number of is managed apartments from a peak of about 30,000 units to roughly 5,000 today.\nSince 2023, GVA has pursued sales, equity recaps and negotiations with lenders, though Stalcup said many lenders were unwilling to modify loans, paving the way for foreclosures. Still, he said the firm continues to operate with about 150 employees and a stabilized core portfolio.\nThe truth of Kastleman\u2019s allegations \u2014 and GVA\u2019s counterclaims \u2014 will ultimately be decided in court. For now, Stalcup said his firm is waiting out debt maturities, hoping values rebound before a major tranche of loans comes due around 2028.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

But the day before the auction, the\nTuttle entities\nfiled chapter 11 petitions in Miami bankruptcy court.\nSince then, the amount owed to Fort Lauderdale-based Fuse, led by Eyal Peretz, has ballooned to $60.1 million including accrued interest and fees, bankruptcy filings show.\nTuttle has not started construction on the project, known as The Mainstreet at Tuttle. The development was planned with 401 apartments, a 125-key hotel, 400,000 square feet of retail, 82,900 square feet of offices and 3,435 parking spaces. The property is among\n13 South Florida development sites\nthat have fallen into distress since 2024.\nRepresentatives for the Tuttle entities, Fuse Group, Concord and Ardent did not respond to requests for comment.\nFuse initially sought to dismiss the bankruptcy petitions by alleging in a motion that Tuttle filed for chapter 11 to stall the auction. In November, Fuse, Tuttle and Ardent representatives attended a settlement conference in which they hashed out the terms of the reorganization plan.\nIf the sale to Concord goes through, $1.8 million would pay unsecured creditors, $471,000 would pay delinquent property taxes, and an undetermined amount would pay attorney fees for the Tuttle entities, the Jan. 23 motion states. The balance would pay off Fuse.\nIf the deal falls through, Ardent would pay Fuse $50 million after acquiring the unified Tuttle entity. Tuttle would also remain as a personal guarantor to the\nFuse\nloans. The largest unsecured creditors include another lender that is owed $7.8 million and BC Architects, which is owed $1.5 million in fees, bankruptcy court filings show.\nU.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Erik Kimball is set to rule on the reorganization plan on Friday.",

        "content": "A pair of adjacent properties in the Golden Triangle of Beverly Hills has traded hands for about $25 million, a deal that sets a recent high-water mark of roughly $1,500 per square foot, according to property records dated early January.\nThe deal involves legacy wealth and newer found fortune in Los Angeles. The seller is connected to Anderson Real Estate, a private, family-owned real estate company. Anderson Real Estate is linked to Topa Equities \u2014 founded by late billionaire and Los Angeles businessman John Anderson, who has a University of California, Los Angeles, school named after him. The buyer is connected to David Mirharooni, a real estate investor via his Brickstar Capital, business records reveal.\nMirharooni, who is chair of the Beverly Hills Chamber of Commerce, declined to comment. Anderson Real Estate did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe Golden Triangle trade encompasses two adjacent parcels that combine for about 16,400 feet at 202 North Canon Drive, a one-story home to Rodeo Realty, and 208 North Canon Drive, which can be used for office or retail. Newmark\u2019s Jay Luchs and Gavin Ketchum brokered the off-market transaction; Luchs confirmed the trade.\nA person familiar with the matter said the buy isn\u2019t necessarily an office play, and the new owner might want to eventually tap its retail use.\nBeverly Hills prices fall into a different category for retail located directly on the famed high-end shopping strip of Rodeo Drive, where a property leased to Tom Ford, Moncler and Balenciaga\nsold\nfor $400 million-plus, which amounted to more than $14,000 per square foot.\nThe deal on Canon is nevertheless pricey given its location and the current office market conditions in areas beyond Rodeo. It commanded more on a square-footage basis than publicly traded real estate investment trust Kilroy Realty\u2019s $200 million-plus Beverly Hills office campus\nbuy\nfrom Tishman Speyer last year, which came to around $700 per square foot. Mirharooni\u2019s deal is also pricier per square foot than Alo Yoga\u2019s $90 million\npurchase\nof a Beverly Hills headquarters that came out to almost $1,100 a square foot late last year.\nBrickstar Capital\u2019s Mirharooni and Daniel Mirharooni recently made another Beverly Hills buy: a retail property on South Robertson Boulevard for almost $8 million, or $985 per square foot, Traded L.A.\nreported\n. The Mirharoonis own Mastro\u2019s on Canon Drive.\nAnderson Real Estate, chaired by Patrick Haden, owns properties throughout the city, including two office towers on Century City\u2019s Avenue of the Stars and another in Beverly Hills\u2019 Golden Triangle on Wilshire Boulevard.\n",

        "content": "Indiana senators took a step toward luring the Chicago Bears across state lines, approving legislation that would set up the legal and financial scaffolding for a new NFL stadium in northwest Indiana.\nIn a 46-2 vote on Tuesday, the Indiana Senate passed Senate Bill 27, which would create the Northwest Indiana Stadium Authority \u2014 a quasi-public entity empowered to issue bonds, acquire land, finance construction and lease a stadium to a private team, the Indianapolis Business Journal\nreported\n. The bill, authored by Republican Sens. Ryan Mishler and Chris Garten, now heads to the House.\nMishler stressed that the legislation stops short of sealing a deal, but rather creates a framework around how ongoing negotiations with the Bears will work, according to the publication.\nIn a December interview with the Chicago Tribune, Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren confirmed the team is looking across state lines. Officials in the southeast Chicago suburbs on the Indiana side of the metro of Hammond and Gary have floated concepts so far.\nThe vote does signal Indiana\u2019s intent as it\npositions itself\nagainst Illinois, where the Bears have\ngrown frustrated by stalled talks\nwith Gov. JB Pritzker and state lawmakers over a long-discussed stadium project tied to the team\u2019s suburban Arlington Heights\nracetrack site\n. The Bears have played at Soldier Field in Chicago since 1971, but have openly floated alternatives.\nThe team welcomed the Senate action in a statement, calling it a positive step forward for Bears fans across\nChicagoland\n.\nUnder SB 27, the stadium authority would effectively stand in for the state as the owner of a new facility. Its three-member board would be composed of top state budget and finance officials, according to the outlet. The authority could issue 40-year bonds to fund land acquisition and construction, with repayment tied to rent, insurance proceeds and other pledged revenues. Any deal would require the Bears to commit to a 35-year lease.\nWhile the authority would own the stadium, the team would cover operating and repair costs and keep stadium-generated revenue. The Bears could buy the venue outright by assuming remaining debt \u2014 or for $1 once the bonds are fully paid.\nSome issues were left intentionally unresolved, including local tax arrangements and adding municipal representation to the authority, the outlet reported. A proposed requirement for minority business participation goals was stripped out during committee review.\nThe House is expected to take up the bill next. Speaker Todd Huston voiced support, but wants a firm commitment from the Bears before anything is finalized.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Donald Bren\u2019s firm, Irvine Company, might be preparing to test how much market appetite remains for top-tier office buildings in downtown Chicago.\nThe Newport Beach, California-based firm is moving toward a potential sale of the 50-story tower at\n1 North Wacker Drive\n, according to sources familiar with the matter and first\nreported\nin Crain\u2019s. Irvine recently interviewed brokerage teams and tapped Eastdil Secured to conduct a strategic review of the 1.4 million-square-foot skyscraper. Should Irvine formally list the tower, it would be the company\u2019s first Chicago office sale since it entered the market in 2010.\nEastdil Managing Director Bryan Rosenberg confirmed to the publication that the firm was retained, but said the property has not been listed.\nAny sale would be closely watched, as\ndowntown office values\nhave been battered by recent market conditions. But the tower at 1 North Wacker possesses a lot to work with,\u00a0 such as a prime riverfront address, strong cash flow and a roster of blue-chip tenants, according to the outlet.\nThe tower generated $47.2 million in net operating income in 2023, according to Bloomberg data tied to its $353 million commercial mortgage-based securities mortgage, which Irvine put in place during a 2021 refinancing. The building was appraised at $664 million at the time.\nThe tower would likely trade far above recent Chicago office deals, many of which involved distressed or sparsely leased properties. Just a couple blocks south, towers at 125 and 200 South Wacker Drive sold last year for under $100 per square foot.\nIrvine, led by the 93-year-old billionaire\nBren\n, has long cultivated a reputation as a patient, long-term holder. In Chicago, the firm also owns the building at 71 South Wacker Drive and last year paid off a $431 million loan on its tower at 300 North LaSalle Street, signaling staying power. But the company has shown it will sell when the timing suits it, having unloaded its\nentire downtown San Diego office portfolio\nover the past two years.\nWhile downtown Chicago office vacancy sits at about 28 percent, 1 North Wacker is roughly 92 percent leased, according to CoStar. Trophy buildings citywide are faring much better than the broader market, with vacancy closer to 11 percent, Colliers data shows.\nThe tower has also proven resilient post-pandemic. PricewaterhouseCoopers signed a 10-year lease extension last year for more than 282,000 square feet, pushing its term to 2038, while Barnes &amp; Thornburg expanded and extended its lease through 2036. Irvine also recently poured $10 million into upgrading the building\u2019s amenity floor.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The locally based nutrition company occupies 118,767 square feet at the EmeryTech campus.\nEmeryTech is currently 66.9 percent occupied, according to the Business Times. The complex has undergone more than $37.9 million in capital improvements, including upgrades to HVAC tech and solar panel installation. On-site amenities include fitness center, rock-climbing gym, showers, outdoor patios and cafeteria.\nAn eventual offloading of the property is expected to be a short sale, meaning it would sell for less than the balance of the debt linked to the property, a source familiar with the site told the Business Times. Such a transaction would resemble other office property sales in Emeryville.\nIn September, LBA Realty bought a 16-story, 350,000-square-foot office building at\n2100 Powell Street\nfor $72.5 million, or $200 per square foot, representing a 57.6 percent drop from the $170.9 million that CBRE Investment Management paid for it in 2018. The $72.5 million transaction price was also a short sale, according to the Business Times. If the EmeryTech property were to be sold at $200 per square foot, the purchase price would total approximately $47 million, per the Business Times.\nAnother Emeryville property once owned by Blackstone also traded hands last year.\nSutter Health bought\na 12-acre life sciences campus in the East Bay city from Blackstone\u2019s\nBioMed Realty\nfor $450 million, or $615 per square foot, with plans to turn the site into a 1.3-million-square hospital and medical center.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Boone Pickens\n, traded last month, closing a choppy chapter in the property\u2019s history.\nMesa Vista Ranch LLC, owned by a group of investors that includes Midland oilman Bailey Peyton and Georgia-based investor J. Bradford Smith, sold the MV2 Ranch in Roberts County to Botas Rotas LLC, owned by Southlake businessman Tim Cummings, according to public records.\nSpanning 12,061 contiguous acres, the property includes several improvements designed to support game, especially quail. A seven-mile water line operates constantly with sprinkler heads set every thousand feet, and the land\u2019s position above the Ogallala Aquifer offers the potential for up to 50 new water wells, according to the listing.\nRepublic Ranches agent Bryan Pickens \u2014 no relation to the late corporate raider and wildcatter \u2014 had the listing. The final sale price is undisclosed, but the property was listed for $16.5 million, almost $1,400 per acre. It was originally listed for $19.6 million last spring.\nThe original Mesa Vista Ranch grew from an initial 2,900-acre purchase Boone Pickens made in 1971. Over the next four decades, the ranch swelled to more than 64,000 acres and improved into a luxury hunting destination, served by an FAA-approved airport and anchored by a 25,000-square-foot mansion dubbed \u201cthe Lodge,\u201d according to published reports. When Pickens decided to list the property in 2017 for $250 million,\nit was the most expensive property on the market in the country\n.\nAfter several price cuts, the Mesa Vista Ranch\nsold\nin 2022 within 10 percent of its final asking price of $170 million, according to\nLand Report\n. Oil investor Bill Kent bought 36,000 acres that included the mansion. A rancher named Travis Chester bought the portion that would become the MV2 Ranch, which he sold to Mesa Vista Ranch LLC in 2023.\nThe company quickly landed in a\nlegal squabble over Pickens\u2019 prestige\n. Kent\u2019s company filed a lawsuit alleging that Peyton and Smith formed Mesa Vista Ranch LLC to flip the 12,000 acres. By using the Mesa Vista name in their marketing materials, the lawsuit claimed, Peyton and Smith misrepresented their largely unimproved acreage as part of the luxurious resort Pickens created. The suit was resolved in\nApril\nwhen Peyton and Smith agreed not to use the Mesa Vista name in their marketing.\nBryan Pickens\u2019 ambitious listing campaign included a video produced last spring in which executives from the outdoor lifestyle magazine \u201cField and Stream\u201d hunted and camped on the ranch with country singer Ben Roberts.",

        "content": "The City Council on Thursday overrode a bevy of mayoral vetoes, including measures that set new restrictions on what types of housing the city finances.\nThe Council reversed 17 of former Mayor Eric Adams\u2019\nvetoes\n, most of which he made on his last day in office. That\u2019s more than the number of vetoes voided by the Council over the last decade, according to Speaker Julie Menin.\nTwo of those\nmeasures\nset minimum percentages for homeownership and low-income units financed by the city, which housing groups argued would interfere with the new mayor\u2019s housing agenda. The Council overrode vetoes on several other real estate-related measures, including one that sets minimum wages for building security officers.\nThe Council, however, didn\u2019t override Adams\u2019 veto of the industry-derided Community Opportunity to Purchase Act, or COPA.\nNew unit requirements\nOne of the bills revived by the Council requires that over a five-year period, at least 4 percent of new housing units financed by the city must be homeownership units. That requirement goes into effect on July 1, 2026.\nAnother measure mandates that at least 50 percent of new units funded by the city be affordable for extremely low-income households (those earning no more than 30 percent of the area median income) and very low-income households (those earning no more than 50 percent AMI). At least 30 percent must be affordable to extremely low-income households. Those thresholds apply over a five-year period and kick in July 1, 2027.\nThe Adams administration estimated that those bills would cost $110 million each year to maintain the city\u2019s current level of housing production and preservation. Though the administration argued against the cost of these and other bills, the mayor didn\u2019t veto a measure that sets minimum construction wages on city-funded housing projects, which his administration estimated would cost more than $400 million annually.\nMayor Zohran Mamdani had voiced concerns about the bills that set minimum thresholds for city-financed housing and their potential effect on his goal to build 200,000 affordable housing units over the next decade.\nA representative for the mayor didn\u2019t immediately comment on the two measures being revived by the City Council on Thursday.\nSome bills remain vetoed\nSome of Adams\u2019 housing-related vetoes, however, weren\u2019t revived. The Council didn\u2019t override the mayor\u2019s veto of another housing regulation bill that would set a minimum percentage of city-financed units with two- and three-bedrooms.\nIt also became clear early this week that COPA\ndidn\u2019t garner enough votes\nto overrule Adams\u2019 veto. Still, progressive Council members, the speaker and the mayor appear determined to revive the measure.\nDuring Thursday\u2019s meeting, Menin acknowledged that bills vetoed by Adams that were not resuscitated by the Council still have a path forward \u201cwhere we can get a supermajority support and address legal issues.\u201d\nThe city\u2019s Law Department flagged constitutional issues around COPA, which would have given city-approved non-profits, as well as joint ventures between for- and not-for-profit firms, the first opportunity to bid on certain distressed multifamily buildings when their owners decide to sell.\nCouncil member Sandy Nurse, the bill\u2019s sponsor, has\nmade clear\nthat she plans to reintroduce the measure.\n\u201cThe bottom line is this: if we do not have stronger protections to keep working class New Yorkers here, they will continue to leave,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cI look forward to working with Speaker Menin on re-introducing the bill and passing it this year.\u201d\nAdditional overrides\nThe Council overrode Adams\u2019 veto of a bill that sets\nminimum wages\nfor office security guards, a change proposed after the fatal shootings at Rudin Management\u2019s 345 Park Avenue last year. The Real Estate Board of New York has raised concerns about the bill, arguing that it undermines labor negotiations and is barred by state law.\nThe body additionally revived a measure aimed at increasing transparency around the co-op application process. Under the measure,\nco-op boards\nmust notify prospective residents that they have received an application to live at a building within 15 days. The board then has 45 days to accept or reject the application.\nThe Council reversed the former mayor\u2019s vetoes of bills that would create a city-run land bank (as long as the state approves it) and allow the city to sell tax liens to the land bank, rather than a private trust.\n",

        "content": "It only took three months for a new record sale on the North Fork.\nA waterfront Southold property at 59600 Main Road closed for $12.4 million, the highest price achieved for a single-lot on Long Island\u2019s North Fork. A bayfront home in Cutchogue sold by the estate of the late gallerist Barbara Gladstone held the previous record after its\n$11.2 million\nsale in October.\nThe Gladstone property, which spans 1.2 acres and works out to over $9 million per acre, still dwarfs the recent Southold one in terms of price per acre.\nThe Southold property spans over 21 acres on the Peconic Bay and offers 470 feet of water frontage and a private beach. Two homes sit on either end of the property: a 3,500-square-foot waterfront residence on the south end and a 2,200-square-foot home on the north end near Main Road.\nA local family had owned the property for three generations when Christian Baiz, who owned the estate with his wife Rosamond Phelps Baiz, died last February. The family had used the property to run Old Field Vineyard, which closed at the end of November.\nCompass\u2019 Bridget Elkin, who had the listing with her husband Eric and also sold the Gladstone estate, said the parents lived in the house by the water while their daughter lived on the north side of the property.\nDespite the scale of the property, Elkin said, most of the interest came from parties with a \u201cresidential eye.\u201d About half of the land is covered in mature vines, and the zoning comes with an agricultural exception that allows for expanded farm operations, including the processing and sales of products like wine, crops and jams, according to the listing.\nElkin said the buyer has already re-hired the same staff that currently manages the vineyard, but its days as a commercial winery are likely over. \u201cIt will probably be more of a vibe of a vineyard,\u201d she said.\nPricing on the North Fork has followed the trajectory of the entire East End, where homes on either side of Peconic Bay have gotten vastly more expensive since 2020.\nThe median sale price $2.3 million for homes in the Hamptons set a new record in the fourth quarter of last year, while the quarterly median sales price on the North Fork broke $1 million for the first time ever last year, according to data from appraisal firm Miller Samuel.\nElkin said the recent sales, including another $8 million home she sold in Cutchogue earlier this year, are \u201cestablishing a new price tier on the North Fork that is possible.\u201d Each sale \u201ccreates data points for people coming into the area considering buying or selling a property of that magnitude,\u201d she added.\nShelter Island has not been immune to the runup in prices, either.

        "content": "As a raft of attorneys\nduke it out in a Manhattan courtroom\nover commercial sex trafficking charges levied against the Alexander brothers, a new lawsuit claims the brothers enacted their alleged scheme in South Florida and were aided and abetted by their family and employers.\nIn a complaint\nfiled in Florida\u2019s Southern District last week\n, Tiffany Rodriguez accused twins Oren and Alon Alexander of a sex trafficking scheme enabled by a Miami club, their parents Orly and Shlomy Alexander, the family\u2019s security firm, Oren\u2019s longtime brokerage Douglas Elliman and the firm\u2019s former chairman and CEO Howard Lorber. Rodriguez named all of these players as defendants.\nThe suit adds to at least 30 civil actions filed against the Alexander brothers (though some have been dismissed) on top of federal sex trafficking charges. Rodriguez alleges the twin brothers, who are on trial in New York with their older brother Tal, \u201cused a network of entities and other individuals who helped facilitate, fund, and enable their sex trafficking scheme.\u201d\nThe suit includes many similar claims to a suit filed by\na group of women in February 2025\n. The past action, filed against all three brothers, raised allegations of attacks that took place between 2009 and 2017 in New York and Florida, and also alleged negligence and encouragement by those closest to the brothers, including their parents and Lorber, who previously denied the allegations through a lawyer. (Rodriguez\u2019s suit does not name Tal as a defendant.)\nThe brothers have denied all allegations and pleaded not guilty to the federal charges.\nSpokespeople for Douglas Elliman, Marriott International, the owner of Edition Hotels, and Orly and Shlomy Alexander did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe assault\nRodriguez says she met the brothers in September 2016 after a promoter invited her and a friend to \u201chang out\u201d with Oren and Alon at Basement Miami, a club under the Edition Hotel.\nAfter drinking in the club\u2019s VIP section, she was in and out of consciousness and later woke up restrained to an office chair. She says in the complaint she was being raped by Oren and Alon \u201csimultaneously,\u201d with the brothers switching off filming on a cell phone.\nShe eventually fled the room and the apartment with her friend, whom she told about the attack, according to the complaint. Later the next day, her boyfriend received a video of the attack, she says in the lawsuit.\nShortly after telling a friend about the attack, she heard from a private investigator acting on Oren\u2019s behalf, \u201cwho conveyed a threatening and coercive message: \u2018the Alexander Brothers asserted that the sexual acts were consensual and that Plaintiff\u2019s credibility would be attacked,\u2019\u201d the lawsuit reads.\nRodriguez said in the complaint she was \u201cunaware of the breadth of Defendants\u2019 conduct\u201d until their\narrests by federal authorities in December 2024\n.\nJuda Engelmayer, a spokesperson for the brothers, denied on their behalf the existence of any video in a statement\nto the Miami Herald\n.\n\u201cAs with the other allegations in this civil filing, these assertions remain unproven,\u201d Engelmayer told the outlet. \u201cQuestions of consent and criminal conduct are determined by evidence, not by hindsight, personal relationships, or narrative claims made years later.\u201d\nThe family firm\nRodriguez named parents Orly and Shlomy as defendants in their capacity as executives at Kent Security, the family-founded private security firm that operates in South Florida and New York, where Alon worked as an executive for much of his adult career.\nShlomy co-founded the firm, where Orly worked as chief financial officer and her brother, Gil Neuman, worked as chief executive officer.\nOrly and Shlomy continued \u201cto employ Alon despite reports dating back to high school that he, along with his brothers, were sexually assaulting and raping women,\u201d the lawsuit says.\nRodriguez added in the complaint that Kent benefited from Alon and Oren\u2019s close relationship, which exposed the firm to the increased visibility, prestige and access to elite client networks that Oren enjoyed as a top luxury broker.\nThe accused enablers at Elliman\n\u201cLorber, and other senior [Elliman] leadership, had knowledge of Oren Alexander\u2019s propensity to sexually abuse women but continued to fund, facilitate, and promote the sex trafficking scheme,\u201d Rodriguez wrote in the complaint.\nLorber was chairman and CEO during Oren and his brother Tal\u2019s 10-year stint at Elliman, and also served as a mentor to the budding star brokers. Oren wrote in the New York Post in 2013 his own father, Shlomy, referred to Lorber as Oren\u2019s \u201csecond father.\u201d\n\u201cMultiple real estate professionals reported that they either had personally told executives at Douglas Elliman about assaults by the Alexander Brothers or had been told about said assaults by company executives,\u201d Rodriguez claimed in the complaint.\nThe claim echoes previous reports that Lorber was aware of specific incidents involving the brothers\u2019 behavior with women. The brothers\u2019 behavior was \u201can open secret\u201d in the industry, former Elliman broker Brian Meier told the New York Times in August 2014, and it was understood Lorber was aware of \u201cat least one incident.\u201d\nTwo claims that reportedly made it to Elliman executives were those of Tracy Tutor, a former top Elliman agent who has appeared on \u201cMillion Dollar Listing Los Angeles\u201d who told the Times she shared a drink with Oren after an event in 2014 before blacking out, and agent Jessica Cohen, who said she attended a 2010 birthday party with Tal, Alon and Oren Alexander hours before passing out and waking up in the hospital after someone found her alone in the street.\nCohen said she told Lorber in 2012, when the two were playing chess after work, that she thought she\u2019d been drugged by Tal and Oren. A spokesperson for Elliman confirmed that Lorber had heard of an incident but maintained that it was confidential and not an official human resources complaint.\n\u201cThe allegations in the complaint concerning Howard Lorber are conclusory and false,\u201d Marc Kasowitz, a lawyer for Lorber, said in a statement. \u201cMr. Lorber had absolutely no role in or knowledge of the Alexander brothers\u2019 alleged sex trafficking venture. Mr. Lorber intends to get the case against him dismissed.\u201d\nElliman\nhas previously denied\nany knowledge of allegations against the Alexanders and Lorber\u2019s possible knowledge of any allegations.",

Business First reported. The sale price was not disclosed.\nJules San Pedro is slated to occupy a 1.3-acre block at 155 West 6th Street in San Pedro\u2019s Waterfront Arts District. The residences will rise next to the $250 million\nWest Harbor development\n, a 42-acre mixed-use entertainment hub set to open this summer.\nThe Jules San Pedro property will consist of a combination of studio, one- and two-bedroom units with amenities including a pool deck, courtyard, sauna, spa, clubhouse, sky lounge, rooftop deck, barbecue areas, pet spa and coworking space with conference rooms. Another 1,276 square feet of ground-floor retail space is planned for the site.\nConstruction on Jules San Pedro is expected to begin this quarter, with the units planned to open to residents by the second quarter of 2028.\nDallas-based High Street Residential is no stranger to the area near the San Pedro Port Complex.\nThe Trammell Crow residential arm recently completed another multifamily development near West Harbor called\nVivo on Harbor\n. The 137-unit residential community is located one block north of the future Jules San Pedro site. The eight-story building at 511 South Harbor Boulevard has 16 units set aside as affordable housing as the developer received a density bonus incentive allowing it to reach 85 feet, or 24 feet higher than zoning allows. Nearly 1,500 square feet of shops and restaurants are also included.\nIn late 2024, Trammell Crow acquired an approved project to build 281 apartments at\n625 South Beacon Street\nin San Pedro. Vancouver, Washington-based Holland Partner Group, which sold the property, was greenlit to build studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments above 2,300 square feet of ground-floor shops and restaurants.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "NASA is officially inviting the private sector deeper into its orbit near Houston, opening the door for commercial development on nearly 184 acres of excess land adjacent to the Johnson Space Center.\nThe space agency issued an announcement for proposals seeking tenants for 183.7 acres within Exploration Park, a site just outside JSC that agency leaders have been positioning as a hub for space-related industry, according to filings posted to the federal contracting site SAM.gov and\nreported\nby the Houston Business Journal. Proposals are due April 30, with NASA hosting site visits on Feb. 18. JLL was named leasing broker for Exploration Park earlier this year.\nA map included with the AFP shows the land carved largely into 10-acre parcels, along with several smaller tracts and a 13-acre section labeled \u201cOption Arrow.\u201d The site is accessible via Saturn Lane and sits inside JSC\u2019s secured perimeter \u2014 a detail that could shape how developers and tenants approach the opportunity, according to the publication.\nNASA\nis offering long-term ground leases with a 20-year base term and two additional 20-year options. Rents range from roughly $8,100 per acre to $11,800 per acre per year, depending on the parcel, with annual rent escalations of 3 percent. According to the AFP, tenants would be responsible for utilities and would need to propose access points that comply with NASA\u2019s security requirements, since all available parcels currently require badge access.\nNASA said it expects office, factory and storage tenants and could allow assembly, university and even mercantile uses, depending on the proposal.\nResidential development\n, however, is explicitly off the table.\nJohnson Space Center leadership has been laying the groundwork for years. Director Vanessa Wyche said in a January interview with the outlet that\nNASA\nviews the effort as a way to accelerate partnerships with commercial space companies and related industries.\nMomentum is already building around JSC, as Texas A&amp;M University\nbroke ground\nin November on its $200 million TAMU Space Institute nearby, backed by state funding. The facility has lined up tenants including Astrolab, Intuitive Machines and Interlune, and is expected to be substantially completed this year.\nElsewhere in Exploration Park, Austin-based American Center for Manufacturing and Innovation has been tapped to develop a 22-building campus across 207 acres, while Houston-based KBR signed a letter of intent this year to build a 45,000-square-foot facility focused on advanced human-centric systems.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Investors in a Brookfield Opportunity Zone fund that invests in New York and Connecticut real estate have been absolutely crushed, but don\u2019t know why.\nThe fund, Brookfield Opportunity 71IV7, had an internal rate of return of negative 18.3 percent through the third quarter of last year. Since mid 2019 it had lost 71 percent of its value.\nOne investor in the fund told me the massive loss \u201cmakes no reasonable sense.\u201d\nIndeed, except for rent-stabilized housing, New York City real estate has bounced back since the pandemic. Even Class B and Class C office space written off for dead has recovered some value, thanks to return-to-office and office-to-resi conversions.\nBut the rise in interest rates alone wiped out billions of dollars in equity, and some individual properties have fared badly. And this Brookfield fund was apparently quite concentrated. It is said to have sunk $1 billion into just a few assets, notably a new apartment building in the Bronx and a mall in Connecticut.\nThe investor thought the Bronx property was a four-tower development at 2401 Third Avenue, but that doesn\u2019t really track because that project appears to be doing well enough. It was able to refinance its construction loan in 2024, as\nThe Real Deal\nreported\n:\n\u201cAres Management refinanced construction debt secured by 460 new apartments at 2401 Third Avenue in the Bronx, and 410 new units at 1 Bell Slip in Brooklyn, both owned by Brookfield Properties. Brookfield has invested heavily in master-planned developments in New York, building 1,350 multifamily units at its Bankside campus in Mott Haven, and 1,200 new units at Greenpoint Landing.\u201d\nThe report added, \u201cRents have held strong in New York. In Mott Haven, at 2401 Third Avenue, units list for $2,900 to $3,900 per month.\u201d The housing lottery for affordable units at the 921-unit development\u2019s four towers, dubbed Lincoln at Bankside (aka 101 Lincoln Avenue),\nlaunched\nin 2023.\nOnly five of the 145 units set aside for 130 percent AMI households are available, according to this\nlisting page\n. However, Brookfield is offering four months of free base rent on a two-year lease and shows\n95 available units\n.\nThat would put the vacancy rate at just above 10 percent, assuming the 921-unit project is complete. That\u2019s not bad for a market-rate project in Mott Haven. It certainly wouldn\u2019t explain the investment fund\u2019s 71 percent drop.\nHowever, there might be more vacant units than the 95 listed as available by Brookfield. And interest rates are much higher now than they were seven years ago, which has broadly devalued real estate. Operating expenses have probably risen more than market-rate rents in Mott Haven, and rents on the affordable units have risen below the rate of inflation.\nAlso, it\u2019s quite conceivable that the fund\u2019s Connecticut mall has tanked since 2019.\nCould all of that add up to a 71 percent loss? Brookfield isn\u2019t saying. Its press team has not responded to three messages sent over the past four weeks.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nEvery new year is\npredicted\n(or at least hoped) to be the year that C-PACE lending gets going in New York. But it never happens. Meanwhile,\ndevelopers\nin\nTexas\n,\nFlorida\n,\nSan Francisco\nand elsewhere are getting\nC-PACE loans\nlike candy from a busted pi\u00f1ata. Why can\u2019t New York lawmakers and bureaucrats make this possible in the alleged finance capital of the world? Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Next year, Con Ed will break out the portion of customers\u2019 gas and electricity bills that goes toward property taxes.\nElsewhere\u2026\nWhile the Mamdani administration slams rent-stabilized landlords and praises resident-run housing, three developments in the latter category didn\u2019t exactly shine in an\naudit\nby the state comptroller.\nThe auditors at Thomas DiNapoli\u2019s office looked at the Mitchell-Lama projects Clinton Towers, Evergreen Gardens and Tivoli Towers and found problems with all of them.\nHazardous physical conditions cited included facade damage, broken self-closing and fire doors and units with mold, water damage and peeling paint. One commercial tenant \u2014 a day care center \u2014 had mouse droppings.\nOn the financial side, the affordable co-ops spent $114,000 on bonuses, holiday parties and gratuities over six years. Another $50,000 went to unknown expenditures.\nAll three developments spent $100,000 on vendors without notifying the Department of Housing Preservation and Development as required. \u201cEvergreen contracted with five vendors with payments over $100,000 without receiving HPD approval and no evidence of competitive bidding,\u201d the audit noted.\nClinton and Tivoli towers left some units vacant for four months or more, leaving $328,000 in rent uncollected.\nThese are not huge problems, but they shed light on the kind of oversight required for Mitchell-Lamas.\nThe main issue with this housing model seems to be that it is not sustainable without government support that other building types \u2014 rent-stabilized, for example \u2014 do not have. As Mitchell-Lama buildings wear down and require more capital investment, and tax breaks expire, their residents run to the government for money.\nLast month, the Hochul administration said it would give Bay Ridge Towers $49 million, or $60,400 per unit. Jimerson Apartments in Brownsville got $39 million, or\n$92,600 per unit\n.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$18.5 million\nfor Unit 16B at the Aman, 730 Fifth Avenue.

The Lenox Hill rentals total 20 units and over 20,000 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $19.5 million for 123 East 61st Street.

The seller was\nJohn Backus\n, and the buyer was a trust. The waterfront home, built in 2019, has five bedrooms and six and a half baths. Backus purchased the home in 2022 for $13 million. It went on the market in September 2024, with an asking price of $15.9 million.\nMichael LeDuc\nwith One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty had the listing, and\nJessica Nasib\nwith JMK Real Estate Agents brought the buyer.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nWest Palm Beach had the top commercial real estate transaction to hit records, thanks to the sale of a Delta Hotels by Marriott branded property at\n1301 Belvedere Road\nfor $23.8 million. The seller of the more than 130,000-square-foot property was\nSagar Dasai\u2019s Activate Hospitality,\nwhich had acquired the building and an adjacent empty development site in 2023.

The seller was an LLC managed by\nJoseph Loren Connor\n, and the buyer was\nZAD PB LLC\n. The two-bedroom pad spans about 2,100 square feet, pricing the deal at roughly $4,300 per square foot.

        "content": "Henry Bott is stepping down as president of Swire Properties in Miami after just three years.\nThe Hong Kong-based firm promoted Dave Martin to take over effective Mar. 16, according to a news release. Bott is moving back to his hometown of London with his family after a career with Swire that spans more than a decade and posts in China, Vietnam and Florida. He was named president in 2023 after\nSwire\u2019s Kieran Bowers\nstepped down to move back to the U.K. as well.\nMartin is also a longtime Swire executive. He joined the firm in 2018 as a vice president focused on the firm\u2019s retail portfolio in South Florida, namely Brickell City Centre, which reached 100 percent occupancy under his leadership. He was promoted to senior vice president in 2023, according to LinkedIn.\nMartin spearheaded Swire\u2019s sale of its majority stake in Brickell City Centre to Simon Property Group for\n$512 million\n, a deal that closed in June. As Swire moved to divest from its Brickell retail holdings, it also sold a dev site to Dubai-based hospitality firm Kerzner International for\n$45 million\nin August.\nNow the firm is focused squarely on its planned Residences at Mandarin Oriental, Miami, the condo-hotel project in Brickell Key.\nThe development includes 298 condos, 121 hotel keys and 28 hotel residences, the release shows. The design team includes Kohn Pedersen Fox, Tristan Auer, Laura Gonzalez and Shma. Fortune Development Sales is leading marketing for the project, which launched in 2023. Prices started at $3.5 million at the time.\nPre-sales total more than $1.2 billion, and construction is slated for later this year, according to the release.\nSwire Properties is a division of global conglomerate John Swire &amp; Sons, the British firm founded in 1816 by John Swire. Swire Properties\u2019 real estate investments are primarily in Asian markets in China, Vietnam, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia and Japan. Miami is its only American market.\nScions of the billionaire Swire family, including Barnaby Swire and Merlin Swire, remain involved in the business as directors of John Swire &amp; Sons.",

        "content": "Retail vacancy in the Loop fell for the second straight year in 2025, offering a modest but meaningful signal that the central business district is clawing its way back from the pandemic-era wipeout.\nThe Loop\u2019s retail vacancy rate dropped to 28.5 percent in 2025, down from 29.8 percent the year before, according to a report from Chicago-based brokerage Stone Real Estate. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat after years of shuttered storefronts and\nstalled leasing\n, the market appears to have hit bottom. Stone principal John Vance told the outlet that renewed activity in key corridors and a slow return of foot traffic contributed to that observation.\nState Street, long the poster child for downtown retail distress, has been a bright spot. A new Gap Factory store at 17 North State Street and a high-profile lease by Barnes &amp; Noble at 150 North State Street helped chip away at vacancies on the corridor, even as some big names continued to leave. The deals suggest retailers with an existing foothold downtown are seeing enough sales to double down, Vance said.\nGap\u2019s return comes eight years after the company closed its flagship State Street store. Vance said the move likely reflects steady performance at the Banana Republic Factory inside Block 37. Barnes &amp; Noble\u2019s lease \u2014 one of the largest State Street has landed in years \u2014 also turned heads.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what momentum does, whether it be bad or good,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAnd right now we\u2019ve got some good momentum.\u201d\nThe picture isn\u2019t\nuniformly rosy\n. State Street lost Saks Off Fifth and Anthropologie in 2024, and the vacancy rate remains elevated. More broadly, the Central Loop submarket saw its vacancy rate fall to 24.7 percent from 26 percent a year earlier, according to the report.\nElsewhere downtown,\nleasing followed\nthe office workers. In the LaSalle/Wacker corridor, improving office occupancy helped draw food-and-beverage tenants to the bases of well-capitalized towers. New arrivals included a butcher shop at 222 North LaSalle Street and fast-casual chains Cava and Mendocino Farms in Willis Tower, according to the publication. That submarket\u2019s vacancy rate dropped to 26.8 percent from 28.6 percent.\nAlong\nMichigan Avenue\nsouth of the river, tourist-oriented concepts drove most of the activity, including Portillo\u2019s and a Hello Kitty-themed caf\u00e9 at 360 North Michigan. Even so, the corridor\u2019s vacancy ticked up to 27.8 percent after a CVS closed at 300 South Michigan.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Another artificial intelligence company is growing in San Francisco.\nAI-powered customer service startup Decagon is\nin talks to lease\ntwo floors of offices spanning approximately 70,000 square feet at 680 Folsom Street, the San Francisco Business Times reported. The firm\u2019s search has been ongoing for months and no deal has closed with landlord\nBXP\n, according to the Business Times.\nThe news comes after an announcement Wednesday that the three-year-old company raised $250 million in a Series D funding round that placed the firm\u2019s value at $4.5 billion. Decagon\u2019s valuation has tripled in the past six months, with a $131 million Series C round last June valuing the company at $1.5 billion. The company said the following month that it planned to use the Series C capital for product development and to increase its employee headcount.\nDecagon is currently based at 100 First Street, across the street from\nSalesforce Tower\nin the city\u2019s Financial District. The size of its offices there are not clear.\nBXP is in negotiations with tenants to lease out 132,000 square feet of offices at 680 Folsom and the adjacent 50 Hawthorne Street. As of Wednesday, BXP has completed two deals for approximately 69,000 square feet at the two buildings, according to the Business Times. The two structures together total 522,406 square feet and were 65.8 percent occupied as of the fourth quarter, up from 59.2 percent the previous quarter, according to the Business Times.\nAI firms have been credited with\ndriving down vacancy and increasing demand\nfor office space in the San Francisco market. The amount of office space that was vacant or available for lease\ndecreased\nby nearly 2 million square feet in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter, marking the steepest drop in office availability in four consecutive quarters of decline, according to CoStar Group.\nCompanies in San Francisco leased\n1 million more square feet than they vacated in the fourth quarter, making for the largest such instance of positive absorption since 2018, per CBRE data cited by the Business Times.\nAI startup\nSierra inked the largest lease deal\nof last year in San Francisco, taking up 300,000 square feet at 185 Berry Street in China Basin. AI-focused companies account for about 2.8 million square feet of the approximately 8 million square feet of offices that firms are currently searching for in San Francisco, according to the Business Times. About 24 percent of office space in San Francisco is empty or available for lease, per CoStar.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The owner of a nearly half-century-old office building in downtown Fort Worth is framing the pending departure of a longtime anchor tenant as an opening, not a setback.\nRange Resources Corporation plans to vacate Two City Place at 100 Throckmorton Street when its lease expires in 2027, relocating to the 40-story 777 Main tower less than a mile away. The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat the Fort Worth-based energy company has occupied the building since 2007 and leases about 112,000 square feet \u2014 roughly 35 percent of the 320,000-square-foot tower \u2014 according to\nCitadel Partners\n, which handles leasing at the property.\nJon Ruff, president and COO of Dallas-based owner Spire Realty Group, confirmed the move and said Range\u2019s decision wasn\u2019t driven by issues at the building. Instead, Ruff said, Spire is already positioning Two City Place to capitalize on what will become one of the largest contiguous blocks of available office space in\ndowntown Fort Worth\n.\n\u201cWe expect that the space is going to lease,\u201d Ruff said. \u201cAnd we expect that it\u2019s going to lease at a rate that is probably better than we would have gotten if we would have renewed Range Resources.\u201d\nRange will take four floors at the 777 Main new trophy tower, which is rising in the central business district. A company spokesman said the new space will be similar in size to its current space, but declined to elaborate on the rationale for the move.\nTwo City Place \u2014 formerly part of the\nTandy Towers complex\n\u2014 is one of two 19-story buildings tied to an annex with retail and a parking garage. The broader City Place complex totals about 1.2 million square feet and once served as RadioShack\u2019s headquarters. Two City Place was last renovated in 2008, while its sister tower was updated in 2014, according to the outlet.\nSpire plans to use the transition to freshen the building, including a \u201cmajor overhaul\u201d of common areas with a focus on the lobby, Ruff said. New ground-floor retail is also on the way, including a coffee shop and Italian restaurant Buonissimo.\nDowntown\nFort Worth\u2019s\ncombined Class A and B vacancy rate sits at about 11 percent, and large blocks of space are scarce, according to Citadel. Two City Place is currently just under 90 percent leased and will be able to offer roughly 120,000 contiguous square feet once Range leaves.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Los Angeles renters looking for a deal might be in luck.\nThe median monthly rent in the Los Angeles metro area\nfell\nto $2,167 in December, marking the lowest price in four years, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing\ndata\nfrom Apartment List. The median rent in Los Angeles County also fell to a four-year low of $2,035 per month.\nRents in L.A. haven\u2019t been that low since January 2022 when apartments were emptier and prices were diminished after former renters went on a pandemic-era homebuying spree.\nThe decrease in rents is in line with national trends, as the U.S. median rent also dropped a four-year low in December. In Southern California, L.A. stands as an outlier. Over the past four years, rents in Orange, Ventura and\nSan Bernardino Counties either rose\nor remained flat.\nWhether the drop is a sign of a further decline or a simple blip remains to be seen. Some experts believe it\u2019s a harbinger of things to come, while others see it as a brief price plateau before rents rise again this year, according to the Times. The winter rental market is usually slower than the summer, and the December 2025 low is only 4.2 percent below the all-time high of $2,262 in August 2022.\nLos Angeles has largely fallen behind other cities like\nSan Diego\nwhen it comes to housing construction, but last year marked a significant uptick in new apartments hitting the market, according to the Times. In total, 15,095 multifamily units were completed in Los Angeles, marking an 18 percent increase year-over-year and the second-highest amount in the past decade, per CoStar data cited by Kidder Mathews in its fourth-quarter multifamily\nreport\n.\nStill, as multifamily housing supply increased, demand fell as L.A. County\u2019s population contracted by 28,000 last year. In turn,\nvacancy\nrates rose to 5.3 percent in December, the highest point since April 2021, according to Apartment List.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Let Baylor University students rejoice \u2014 a\nchurch\ncomplex near the college is set to make room for a\nstudent housing development\n.\nAustin-based owner-operator Parallel plans to spend $59 million to build a seven-story student housing development on the northeastern portion of Seventh and James Baptist Church in Waco, according to a Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation\nfiling\n. The development will have 264 units accommodating 630 beds in a metal frame construction, the filing and Parallel\u2019s\nplans\nshow. TDLR filings are preliminary and subject to change.\nThe 127-year-old congregation owns about 4.5 acres next to Baylor University, and the 2.4-acre parcel allotted to the upcoming project is now under contract, according to Cromwell Commercial Group associate Caleb Loudamy, who has the listing for the property.\nThe new building will replace the sanctuary of the church, which was built in 1955, a student newspaper\nreported\n.\nAttorney and theologian Kent McKeever, a Baylor affiliate and member of the church, has an organizational role in the project, according to the filing. McKeever, founding partner of nonprofit legal aid organization, Waco Legal Services, attracted national attention some years ago for\nwearing a prison jumpsuit for Lent\n.\nNeither McKeever nor an associate with Parallel immediately responded to requests for comment.\nIn a trend dubbed \u201cYes in God\u2019s Backyard,\u201d developers around the country are scouting land owned by religious organizations, which are among the biggest landowners in America. In\nHouston\n, a senior housing project is planned for land owned by a Methodist church in the Third Ward neighborhood. In\nAustin\n, a church is developing a mixed-use project around its next branch. And in\nDallas\n, Generation Housing Partners is planning to replace a defunct church building with an affordable apartment complex.Waco isn\u2019t the only college town in Texas where developers are putting millions into student housing. In College Station, where\nlocal ordinances constricted student rental housing supply until last year\n, Subtext plans to spend\n$160 million\non a 21-story tower a block and a half from Texas A&amp;M University.\n",

        "content": "Cirrus Real Estate Partners won the do-over bankruptcy auction for a distressed downtown Miami development site, only this time it will pony up $18 million more than its previous winning bid.\nNew York-based Cirrus, the lender on the nearly 1-acre property at 340 Biscayne Boulevard, made the opening $77 million credit bid Wednesday and competed with an unknown bidder in $5 million increments, with Cirrus ultimately winning at $95 million, Bisnow\nreported\n.\nConcierge Auctions held the second auction after Brazilian developer Gilberto Bomeny\u2019s\nlegal complaint\ngot Cirrus\u2019 initial win tossed. Gabriel Flores of One Commercial, a subsidiary of One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, listed the site.\nThe sale isn\u2019t final until approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Laurel Isicoff in Miami, who is expected to take up the deal in a Feb. 11 hearing.\nThe outcome marks another chapter in the saga between Cirrus and the property owner, Bomeny, over the 10-story, 200-key Holiday Inn, which has approvals for an 82-story redevelopment.\nCirrus filed a Uniform Commercial Code foreclosure in 2024 against Bomeny\u2019s entity, alleging it defaulted on a\n$70 million\nloan.\nBomeny paid $65 million in 2015 for the site and 1950-built hotel. The property was already approved for an Arquitectonica-designed tower with\n374 condos\n, 120 hotel rooms, offices and retail, along with 500 parking spaces.\nAfter the UCC foreclosure filing, Bomeny\u2019s affiliate filed for Chapter 11 reorganization, leading to the first bankruptcy auction last month. Bidding had opened at $72 million. Cirrus, led by Joseph McDonnell, won with a\n$77 million\ncredit bid.\nBut Bomeny\u2019s ownership entity convinced the judge to order a do-over auction, alleging \u201cconstant changes and irregularities\u201d in the auction process that barred bidders who would have ponied up more money for the site.\nCirrus disputed that in court filings, accusing Bomeny of being \u201cunwilling to accept the auction\u2019s outcome\u201d and arguing that other potential bidders hadn\u2019t registered for the auction and submitted a required $250,000 deposit.\nThe judge\nordered\nthe do-over auction this month.\nCirrus representatives and attorneys for Bomeny\u2019s entities didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. Bomeny was a development partner in the Zaha Hadid-designed One Thousand Museum condo tower in downtown Miami and the Regalia Residences condo in Sunny Isles Beach.\nThe UCC foreclosure and subsequent bankruptcy auctions came as landlords are struggling with elevated interest rates that shot up following increases in 2022 and 2023. This increased loan obligations for property owners with floating-rate debt and\nno interest rate caps\n, and made refinancing maturing loans more expensive.\nAlthough the Federal Reserve made several cuts to the benchmark rate in 2024 and last year, it kept rates steady this month.\nSouth Florida owners also felt an additional sting from skyrocketing insurance premiums in recent years and increases in other expenses due to higher labor and materials costs.\nSome multifamily development site owners who had planned to seize on South Florida\u2019s rental boom of recent years instead\nput their properties on the for-sale market\n, either looking for project equity partners or scrapping projects altogether.\nOther landlords lost their properties in foreclosure.\nAlso in downtown Miami, Raoul Thomas\u2019 CGI Merchant lost its 129-key Gabriel Downtown Miami hotel in a UCC foreclosure to lender Madison Realty Capital in 2024 over a\n$60.4 million loan\n. The hotel is on the first 14 floors at the luxury Marquis condo tower at 1100 Biscayne Boulevard.\n",

        "content": "Two 432 Park Avenue condos\nat the center of an ownership\ndispute between Harry Macklowe and CIM Group have gone into contract.\nA buyer in the building has agreed to pay $53 million for units 78A and 78B, which combine to span the entire 78th floor, two sources familiar with the deal told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe seller is an entity tied to the building\u2019s sponsor, CIM Group, and not, as some had previously been led to believe, Harry Macklowe, who lost the units last year after he defaulted on the loans he had taken out from CIM to purchase the units in 2021.\nIf the deal closes at that price, it would be nearly exactly how much CIM claimed Macklowe owed in October 2023, when it had originally scheduled a foreclosure sale for the units, according to court filings.\nMacklowe paid roughly $47 million for the two 78th-floor units and a smaller 28th-floor unit, according to public records. The deal does not include the accessory unit, a source told\nTRD\n.\nThe kerfuffle over who owned the units began after a Douglas Elliman agent approached the Wall Street Journal with an exclusive story last year about Macklowe\u2019s plan to list the 78th-floor units for $75 million.\nThose plans were shot once it was revealed that Macklowe\nno longer controlled the units\n. CIM had provided the mezzanine financing for Macklowe when he purchased the units in 2022, over a decade after CIM had helped finance Macklowe\u2019s purchase of the Drake Hotel, which would ultimately become the 432 Park development. A year after buying the penthouse units, in 2023, CIM initiated foreclosure proceedings, which were ultimately halted due to a settlement that gave Macklowe a five-month period to refinance or sell the units.\nMacklowe was unable to fulfill the settlement requirements. A court order from July of last year confirmed that the units had been transferred to CIM and that Macklowe and his wife, Patricia Landeau, were ordered to vacate the premises by the end of August.\nThe 78th-floor spans 8,300 square feet and is divided into one larger 7,000-square-foot unit and a smaller 1,200-square-foot unit. The second unit could be \u201cseamlessly combined or maintained as a separate guest apartment,\u201d according to marketing materials provided to the Journal.\nSerhant\u2019s Glenn Davis and Nicholas Compagnone had the off-market listing, according to multiple sources.\nManaging to sell the units for more than Macklowe paid is still a win in a building that has faced a slew of bad press around lawsuits between the condo board and the developers, Macklowe and CIM, in the last few years.\nA lawsuit filed by the condo\nin 2021\nalleged that the 125-unit building was plagued with noise issues, leaks and broken elevators. The developers have denied those claims, but the residents followed up last year with\nanother lawsuit\nclaiming Macklowe and CIM knew the building would have problems and proceeded anyway.\nThe drama has seemed to weigh on the prices of units for sale. Ten of the 13 units currently listed on StreetEasy have experienced a price drop. Unit 84B, one of the units without a price drop, is listed for $75 million after its owner, Jose Cuervo owner Juan Beckmann Vidal, had\nreportedly\noriginally considered listing it for $90 million.",

For a deal to cross the finish line, the biggest issue that needs to be worked out is rent payments for Cooper Union, which owns the ground underneath the building. The ground rent is expected to hit $41 million in two years, according to the college\u2019s financial statement.\nIt would be a return for Rob Speyer\u2019s firm, which acquired the Chrysler Building in 1997 for $220 million. Over the next couple of decades, its interest in the property dwindled, finally washed away for good in 2019 when RFR and Signa Holding bought Tishman\u2019s remaining stake for $150 million.\nBut Cooper Union has been\nworking with Savills\nfor the better part of a year to find fresh ownership as RFR was kicked out and Signa went bankrupt.\nLast January, a judge\nterminated RFR\u2019s ground lease\nat the property, ejecting it from the skyscraper.\nRFR had sued Cooper Union in September 2024 after the school moved to terminate the company\u2019s ground lease. Cooper Union claimed the developer stopped paying rent several months earlier and racked up arrears to the tune of $21 million.\nSL Green\u2019s Marc Holliday\nexpressed interest\nin acquiring the property several months ago, but his interest reportedly cooled since then. Savanna, a Midtown office owner that\u2019s been making moves left and right, was also interested in the building.\nShould Tishman lock in its return, it will have work to do to restore the Chrysler Building to its former glory. The tenant roster includes law firm Moses &amp; Singer, Creative Artists Agency and architect Ted Moudis, but there have been complaints about elevator outages and mice. The vacancy rate of the 1-million-square-foot building is 14 percent, according to CoStar.\nTishman declined to comment to the publication.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Otaola lost to Levine Cava, placing third in an August 2024 election that the incumbent won by a landslide.\nThe county\u2019s Republican Party is supporting the recall effort against\nLevine Cava\n, a Democrat, through social media, paid ads and a website to promote the petition, which needs to be signed by at least 4 percent of Miami-Dade\u2019s 1.6 million registered voters to trigger an election.\nHowever, Levine Cava will surely count on South Florida\u2019s real estate industry to financially back efforts to tamp down the recall.\nDuring her 2024 campaign, roughly a quarter of the\n$4.6 million\nher political action committee raised prior to the August election came from 17 real estate developers and commercial property investors, finance reports analyzed by\nThe Real Deal\nshow.\nBillionaire hedge fund manager\nKen Griffin\ngave the largest contribution, with a $500,000 donation. Recently, the county approved plans for his firm Citadel\u2019s planned high-rise headquarters in Miami\u2019s Brickell neighborhood.\nLevine Cava\u2019s PAC collected $110,000 between October and December with half of the funds donated by real estate developers, a campaign finance report shows.\nSince she was first elected in 2020, the county has added 9,000 affordable and workforce housing units, and it will aim to add 12,000 more by the time she leaves office in 2028, Levine Cava said during her speech.\nHer administration has negotiated deals with developers to build mixed-income projects on county-owned land, including agreements to redevelop dilapidated public housing sites. The mayor identified two projects,\nGallery at River Parc\nand Brisas del Rio, by Coconut Grove-based Related Group as examples of her efforts.\n\u201cWhat was once outdated, public housing is now a walkable, mixed income community with more homes, shops, green spaces and support services,\u201d Levine Cava said. \u201cBut there\u2019s still more work to do. I directed our housing team to identify vacant county land that can be transformed into housing.\u201d\nLevine Cava highlighted permitting kiosks placed around the county to help small businesses cut through bureaucratic hurdles, and a program that provides financing to condo owners who don\u2019t have funds to pay for special assessments. During the speech, she pointed to Harrison Bloom, a constituent in the audience who opened a frozen yogurt store in Miami Beach.\n\u201cHarrison ran into familiar problems,\u201d Levine Cava said. \u201cHis plans were stalled by red tape, and city and county permitting. Through our new Strive 305 permitting kiosks, Harrison was able to complete all his permits in just 16 days.\u201d\nThe special assessment assistance program has provided a combined $53 million in interest-free loans to nearly 2,000 households in Miami-Dade, Levine Cava said.",

        "content": "Concern and offense were aired Thursday by members of an oversight committee following an attempt earlier this week to jam\namendments\nto LA\u2019s so-called mansion tax onto the June ballot.\nThursday\u2019s vote by the Measure United to House L.A. Citizens Oversight Committee, the group established through the November 2022 ballot measure to monitor use of Measure ULA funds, could offer a look at the uphill battle proposed carveouts to the two-tier property tax could face in the coming months.\nMeasure ULA\n, which went into effect in April 2023, applies a 4 percent tax on all real estate deals \u2013 commercial or single-family \u2013 starting at $5.3 million. The tax bumps up to 5.5 percent on deals of $10.6 million or more.\nThe 15-member oversight committee agreed on Thursday to send a letter to the city council expressing concern for being excluded from any process to amend Measure ULA, The body also appointed its own ad hoc committee to take a closer look at the exemptions being sought.\n\u201cHonestly, it is so offensive that this amendment was proposed [to the] city council without even once coming to the COC,\u201d committee member Jeanne Nishimoto said during the meeting. She went on to say the bid for a fast-tracked move to make changes to ULA \u201chighlights that this body is being pushed aside.\u201d\nDemocratic Socialist Nithya Raman, a leader among local progressives who represents the 4th District on the City Council, introduced her proposed changes on Friday. They seek a 15-year exemption from ULA on new multifamily, commercial and mixed-use projects in what is the most significant proposed change to the ordinance since it rolled out nearly three years ago. In addition, the motion called for a one-time, three-year carveout from ULA for property owners impacted by a natural disaster and retroactive to Jan. 7, 2025 to address Palisades Fire damages.\nRaman and supporters of the ULA changes had hoped for consideration and a vote from the 15-person council this week. However, the bid to push it onto the June ballot evaporated on Wednesday, the deadline for the city attorney to prepare a resolution for such a measure.\nInstead, Tuesday\u2019s council meeting kicked Raman\u2019s proposal down to the\nHousing and Homelessness Committee\n, which has yet to place the item on a future meeting agenda.\nWhile the ULA oversight committee\u2019s decisions do not create policy, the group acts as an advisor to the city and is billed as a cross-section of individuals with experience in housing development and finance, renter protection,\u00a0 and also includes two youth \u2014 ages 16 to 21\u2014 advisory seats.\n\u201cUnintended consequences\u201d\nAs of Thursday, Measure ULA has raised $1.1 billion across 1,497 transactions since inception. Supporters of the tax often point to the metric as proof of its\nsuccesses\n.\nCritics often take aim at the figure and harken back to 2022, when the ballot measure and its backers estimated to voters that $600 million to $1.1 billion could be generated each year from ULA.\nThe largest contributing segment to that total has been single-family residential of which 864 deals have brought in $441.5 million, according to data from the Los Angeles Housing Department through the end of 2025.\nMultifamily, which generally refers to apartments and\u00a0 is the driver behind Raman\u2019s proposed changes, is the third-largest bucket of ULA revenue, behind offices and various other types of commercial properties. Since April 2023, the multifamily segment generated has $171.9 million, or 13 percent of the overall pie.\nRaman and others, including real estate industry executives, argue that the tax has stifled multifamily construction, which runs counter to ULA\u2019s stated goal of housing affordability and homelessness prevention. Across the real estate industry brokers, agents and developers have offered similar takes as deals and construction stalls.\nMike Leipart, co-founder and managing principal of real estate sales and advisory firm Redeavor, told a crowd gathered Tuesday in Beverly Hills for\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s \u201cBuilding Luxury\u201d panel that he\u2019s seen apartment owners go for conversions and sell units individually rather than try to market a whole building and pay the ULA tax.\nSean Burton, CEO and chief investment officer of Cityview, told\nTRD\non Monday he\u2019s seeing a similar trend play out.\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting the way ULA is structured, it\u2019s actually an incentive for many landlords and property owners to break up their multifamily projects and sell them as individual units and take them out of the renter pool,\u201d Burton said. \u201cI think that\u2019s just starting to happen, but I\u2019ve heard a number of landlords talk about that because they simply feel they have no choice. I think that would be really unfortunate because the last thing we need is to be taking multifamily units out of the renter pool. It\u2019s only going to drive rents up for everybody else.\u201d\nWhile the changes would be a boon to apartment and commercial construction, some say they don\u2019t address the pain points of what luxury single-family residential agents have faced with deals falling apart or extended negotiations over the tax.\n\u201cNatural disaster exemptions are especially important, but there is still work to be done to ensure ULA does not continue to discourage investment at a time when Los Angeles needs housing and economic momentum,\u201d Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California founder and CEO Aaron Kirman told\nTRD\nthis week.\n",

        "content": "The Hamptons\u2019 residential market rode Wall Street money and tight inventory to a banner quarter.\nDuring the last three months of 2025, median home prices rose over 33 percent annually to over $2.3 million, according to a report from appraisal firm Miller Samuel for Douglas Elliman. The price marks an all-time high for the wealthy enclave.\nThe fourth quarter saw a second record for the market, with 82 homes sold for over $5 million.\nThe period caps off a return to form in the Hamptons in 2025, swept up by\na strong luxury wave\nin markets around the country. The Hamptons submarket has been hit by a double-whammy for surging prices: a booming stock market and no inventory, according to report author Jonathan Miller.\nLike other markets, the Hamptons saw deals for more affordable homes lag amid high mortgage rates, while luxury homes trade for peak prices and typically to all-cash buyers.\nMedian prices had cracked $2 million for the first time at the start of 2025. The share of homes sold for over $1 million has historically been 50 percent in the Hamptons, according to Miller, but last quarter it fell to below 30 percent.\n\u201cA big part of this price growth, it\u2019s not appreciation as much as it is a shift in the mix towards larger units,\u201d said Miller.\nThe very top of the market felt that movement last year. In 2025, the top 10 priciest deals in the Hamptons accounted for $579 million in transaction volume, a significant increase from $327 million in 2024.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all driven by the economy,\u201d said Douglas Elliman\u2019s Martha Gundersen, who had the listing for a\n$57 million sale\nin Bridgehampton in October. Gundersen noted that Wall Street bonuses drive much of the first-time Hamptons buyers who look in the sub-$20 million market, while the deals over $20 million often attract \u201cunique buyers.\u201d\n\u201c[They] sold a company, own a company [are] CEO of a company that is a financial institution that does really, really well,\u201d she said of the buyer profile of the ultra-luxury housing stock.\nThis year also saw the most expensive single-lot residential sale in Hamptons history, when Access Industries\u2019\nLen Blavatnik paid a record $115 million\nfor eight-and-a-half acres at 408 Further Lane.\nThere were roughly 1,000 homes on the market in the fourth quarter, well below the long-term historical average. The 470 sales were above the 10-year average for the fourth quarter.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the wild card in terms of seeing more activity in the Hamptons in 2026 will be, whether more sellers dip their toe into the market,\u201d he said.\n",

The refinancing will help with carrying costs for the unsold units at the West Chelsea site.\nWalker &amp; Dunlop Capital Markets Institutional Advisory arranged the financing.\nThe debt is the latest sign of how far the development has come in the years since Access and Witkoff took the reins from the now-defunct HFZ Capital Group.\nWitkoff and Access\ntook over\nthe Eleventh Avenue site in 2021 after the project\u2019s primary lender foreclosed on HFZ\u2019s stake. Under HFZ, the development was plagued by conflicts with contractors, sluggish sales and concern over the company\u2019s financial standing.\nAccess and Witkoff paid $900 million for the property, roughly the same amount HFZ paid for it in 2015. But it was already nearly two-thirds complete when it was sold by HFZ.\nWhen the developers resumed work, they put their own stamp on the property, updating unit designs so that no two in either of the twisting towers were identical. They also changed the amenity package and the finishes and swapped out a planned Six Senses Hotels Resorts Spas for a five-star Faena Hotel.\nIn the summer of 2022,\nsales re-launched\nat the project rebranded as One High Line from The XI.

        "content": "A North Side Chicago congregation is moving closer to a major lakefront-adjacent redevelopment that could bring hundreds of apartments, retail and a new place of worship to Sheridan Road.\nEmanuel Congregation, which has occupied its campus at 5959 North Sheridan Road since the 1950s, is working with Chicago-based developer Fern Hill Company on a mixed-use plan that would replace and expand the synagogue while adding residential buildings on both sides of the street,\naccording\nto Block Club Chicago. After months of meetings with congregants and neighborhood groups, the team submitted a zoning change request to 48th Ward Alderman Leni Manaa-Hoppenworth\u2019s office.\nThe proposal would allow two new buildings, the centerpiece being a 12-story, U-shaped structure fronting Sheridan Road that would incorporate a new synagogue on its lower floors, ground-floor commercial space and apartments above. Across the street, Fern Hill plans a five-story apartment building at 5948\nNorth Sheridan Road\n, a vacant parcel the firm bought last year for $5 million from Chicago-based Quest Realty Group, the outlet reported. Quest had previously explored a smaller, 59-unit\napartment project\non the site.\nIf approved, the larger building would also absorb Emanuel\u2019s existing synagogue and a neighboring home at 5965 North Sheridan, which Fern Hill would acquire as part of the deal, Fern Hill President Nick Anderson told Block Club. Renderings show the project opening south toward Lane Beach, an orientation the current building lacks.\nThe final unit count and parking totals are still in flux and will be shaped by further\ncommunity input\n, Anderson said. But under the zoning envelope the team is seeking, the development could support up to 605\napartments\nacross both buildings. Any rezoning would trigger Chicago\u2019s Affordable Requirements Ordinance, requiring 20 percent of the units to be affordable.\nFor the congregation, the redevelopment is as much about right-sizing as it is about location. Emanuel\u2019s existing 35,000-square-foot synagogue opened in 1955, when planners expected DuSable Lake Shore Drive to extend north through the site. Designed with a highway in mind, the building\u2019s east wall is largely windowless and soundproofed, according to the publication, even though the road was never built and Lake Michigan now sits just steps away.\nToday, Emanuel counts about 250 households and said the aging building is too large and costly to maintain. Plans call for a more efficient synagogue occupying the second and third floors of the new building, with a sanctuary, chapel, social halls, classrooms and offices. Housing revenue would help fund construction.\nManaa-Hoppenworth said her office will host a community meeting on the proposal next month.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Three Oakland office properties have been taken over by a receiver after falling into \u201csignificant disrepair\u201d following a loan default.\nLender Rialto Capital Management\nfiled a lawsuit\nin Alameda County Superior Court to foreclose on a portfolio that includes\nOakland\u2019s Tribune Tower\n, the Financial Center building at 405 14th Street and offices at 1500 Broadway, the San Francisco Business Times reported. The move comes after Highbridge Equity Partners defaulted on a $111 million Rialto loan last year. Touchstone Commercial Partners\u2019 Christian Diggs has been appointed as receiver, operating and managing the property in Highbridge\u2019s place.\nThe three buildings have seen better days, according to the lawsuit. The legal filings claim the structures have broken windows, asbestos, and faulty elevators among other debris. People have reportedly been entering the buildings illegally and stealing copper wiring and others have been illegally camping inside, a receiver report said.\nTribune Tower at 401 13th Street reportedly has significant flood damage and is riddled with drug paraphernalia, abandoned mattresses and health and safety hazards like dog feces. The 16-story Financial Center Building a block away at 405 14th Street has a large amount of asbestos and debris with broken elevators. The 1500 Broadway building has broken windows and is plagued with plumbing and electrical issues.\nIn addition to defaulting on the $111 million loan, Highbridge also owed approximately $650,000 in property taxes across all three properties when the receiver took over last fall, which the receiver worked with Rialto to pay off. Another $650,000 payment is due in April. Rialto provided the $111 million loan in 2022 to refinance $91.1 million in existing debt and to pay for future renovations and improvements on the properties.\nHighbridge reportedly stopped making monthly payments on the debt last June and was\nserved a notice of default\ntwo months later. The unpaid balance is reportedly north of $100 million.\nHighbridge bought the three buildings between 2016 and 2019, for a total of $119.6 million. Whether Highbridge\u2019s lenders choose to sell the buildings to recoup all or some of the $111 million loan remains to be seen.\nOakland and the rest of the Bay Area have seen a\nstring of loan defaults and foreclosures\nat commercial properties in recent years. This week alone, Deutsche Bank\nseized\nthree other office towers in downtown Oakland via deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, taking control of 2101 Webster Street, 1901 Harrison Street and 2100 Franklin Street.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

In total, the landlords reportedly booked almost 3,000 reservations that violated the city\u2019s Residential Leasing Requirements Ordinance.\nAccording to city attorneys, the landlords would wait for long-term tenants to move out, list the unit online, rent it out for month-to-month stays and cover up their tracks with what the city calls a \u201csham\u201d one-year lease after the booking was confirmed. Guests allegedly booked their intended stays on Airbnb and then were asked to sign leases that made the rentals look compliant with city laws even though neither tenant nor landlord intended for there to be a year-long tenancy.\nThe rentals were usually furnished and not used as primary residences by\nthe tenants\n, both of which are illegal under the ordinance. The landlords in some cases also allegedly did not file rent-control vacancy registration forms. Santa Monica\u2019s Residential Leasing Requirements Ordinance was passed in 2020 and requires leases to be one year or longer for unfurnished units and for tenants to use the units as their primary residence. The goal with the legislation is to keep much-needed multifamily housing off the short-term rental market.\n\u201cPreserving rent-controlled apartment homes and keeping rents down are top priorities for the city,\u201d Jonathan Frank, deputy city attorney for the City of Santa Monica, said in a\nstatement\n. \u201cThe city takes violations of its short-term rental ordinances seriously and will enforce them when needed.\u201d\nCity officials are asking the county to step in and put a stop to the alleged rental violations, force the disgorgement of the roughly $18 million in profits made and hand down civil penalties of $2,500 per violation. The case is pending in Los Angeles County Superior Court.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The building, long known as the Tremont Hotel, last traded after being swept up in a foreclosure and briefly repurposed by the city during Chicago\u2019s migrant crisis, CoStar\nreported\n.\nThe sale comes as signs of life return to the Magnificent Mile, the city\u2019s marquee retail strip along Michigan Avenue that struggled with vacancies and muted leasing since the pandemic. Hotel investors are starting to show up again, and late last year,\nVinayaka Hospitality\npaid $72 million for the 752-room Westin Michigan Avenue Chicago at 909 North Michigan Avenue, one of the corridor\u2019s biggest recent lodging trades.\nThe Chestnut Street property has had a turbulent few years. It housed\nMike Ditka\u2019s\nlongtime namesake restaurant, a neighborhood fixture that closed in early 2020 after more than two decades, shortly after the hotel \u2014 then operating under the Selina brand \u2014 shut down as a result of the pandemic, according to the outlet.\nIndianapolis-based Hotel Capital owned the vacant property when it was hit with a $25 million foreclosure lawsuit in 2023 by a lender affiliated with\nLaSalle Investment Management\n. After the legal process played out,\nthe city leased the building\nin 2023 and 2024 as a temporary homeless shelter to help absorb an influx of migrants and a shortage of beds for unhoused residents. The shelter closed in September 2024.\nLaSalle Investment Management seized the property through a judicial sale last fall and sold it to Avasa. The $13.2 million acquisition was financed with a $10 million loan from Millennium Bank, records show. Paramount Lodging Advisors\u2019 Sanjeev Misra represented the seller.\nAvasa Hospitality, based in Elk Grove Village, has five suburban Chicago hotels in its portfolio as well as experience in hotel design and management, according to their website.

In May, the nonprofit\npurchased 2,490 acres\nof land at the ranch. The previous October, the trust bought the adjacent 1,340-acre Pescadero Ranch, which was previously part of the Sargent Ranch. Peninsula Open Space Trust made the latest acquisition with financial help from the Santa Clara Valley Water District, Land Trust of Santa Cruz County and other unnamed donors. The nonprofit now owns 6,114 acres of the 6,500-acre ranch and is in contract to buy the remaining acreage later this year.\nSargent Ranch Partners LLC, an investor group led by\nSan Diego\nbusinessman Howard Justus that previously owned the land, sought to develop a 403-acre mining operation at the ranch to extract 38 million tons of sand and gravel over 30 years. The proposal faced fierce backlash from locals out of concern for noise, congestion and damage to the landscape. The developer hasn\u2019t officially killed its quarry plan, though the sale of the property is likely the end of that endeavor. Owners also had floated various commercial ventures at the location, including hotels, golf courses and a casino.\nThe region\u2019s\nNative American\ncommunity, the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band, helped lead efforts to stop development on the land, which they call Juristac.

        "content": "A long-simmering grievance among homeowners is hardening into a national political push to eliminate property taxes on primary residences altogether.\nRising assessments have juiced tax payments across the country, and Republican lawmakers in several states are now floating plans that would upend one of local government\u2019s core revenue streams \u2014 with sweeping implications for housing, schools and municipal finance, the Associated Press\nreported\n. The movement is gaining traction in oil-rich North Dakota and Sun Belt growth states alike.\nNorth Dakota Republicans said they are already on a path to zeroing out homeowner property taxes by tapping the state\u2019s $13.4 billion oil tax savings account. In Georgia, House Republicans this week rolled out a plan to phase out most homeowner property taxes by 2032. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis embraced a similar goal, while Texas Gov. Greg Abbott wants to eliminate property taxes that fund schools, the outlet reported.\nTexas has been using its surplus funds to finance property tax reductions. In November, Texas voters increased the state\u2019s\nhomestead exemption\n\u2014 the portion of a home\u2019s value shielded from school property taxes \u2014 from $100,000 to $140,000. That translates to roughly $490 in annual savings for the owner of a typical $302,000 Texas home,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported.\nFollowing the vote, Abbott launched his reelection campaign in November by pitching a six-point plan that would slash appraisal growth, restrict local spending and give voters far greater control over tax increases.\nAccording to Abbott, the Legislature\u2019s record $51 billion allocation for tax relief in 2025 was blunted by local governments raising their own levies. Abbott now wants to\ntie local spending growth\nto 3.5 percent, or population growth plus inflation, whichever is lower, and by extending the state\u2019s debt and deficit limits to counties, cities and school districts.\nProperty taxes generate billions \u2014 or tens of billions \u2014 annually in most states, underwriting K-12 schools, police and fire departments and basic municipal services. Replacing that revenue without\ngutting services\nwould require higher sales taxes, new fees or deep spending cuts.\nIn Georgia, House Speaker Jon Burns wants to wipe out $5.2 billion in homeowner property taxes, more than a quarter of the state\u2019s total property tax haul in 2024. Cities, counties and school districts would be pushed to lean on existing or newly approved sales taxes, capped at a combined local rate of 5 percent on top of the state\u2019s 4 percent. The plan would also allow local governments to bill homeowners separately for services like garbage pickup and fire protection \u2014 fees lawmakers insist are not taxes.\n\u201cNo one should ever face the loss of their home because they can\u2019t pay rent to the government,\u201d Burns said as he unveiled his plan.\nThe appeal is obvious for real estate, as property taxes are often baked into housing affordability calculations, and sharp increases have been especially painful for retirees and owners who have paid off their mortgages. In fast-growing metros, tax relief could buoy home values and reduce pressure to sell, according to the publication.\nBut policy analysts warn the cure could be worse than the disease, as past revolts, like California\u2019s Proposition 13, reshaped development patterns and constrained local budgets for decades. Critics cited by the outlet said that eliminating\nhomeowner taxes\nrisks shifting the burden onto renters, commercial property owners or consumers through higher sales taxes.\nNorth Dakota\u2019s approach \u2014 using state oil revenues to subsidize local governments \u2014 is the cleanest case, but it\u2019s also the hardest to replicate. The outlet reported that elsewhere, proposals face political hurdles, constitutional amendments and voter approval.\nThe property tax revolt is back, but whether it becomes law \u2014 or just another campaign-season promise \u2014 will determine who really pays for the American home.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Getting an apartment project off the ground in today\u2019s tight lending environment and sluggish multifamily market isn\u2019t easy, but\npublic-private partnerships and North Texas growth\ncan provide a much-needed boost.\nStryker Properties and Griffon Capital Management scored financing for Freemont Frisco Apartments, a planned project with an affordable component in fast-growing\nFrisco\n. BridgeInvest is providing a $57 million construction loan for the 313-unit development that will be built at 9402 Frisco Street, according to a news release from the lender. The financing works out to about $182,000 per unit.\nAn undisclosed portion of the units will be available at\naffordable rates\n, as part of the project\u2019s partnership with the Housing Authority of the City of Frisco. The developer team did a sale-leaseback with the organization and entered into a ground lease, property records show.\nPublic-private partnerships have been critical to getting projects to pencil while institutional lending is harder to access.\nPlus, Frisco\u2019s rapid growth insulates projects from the region\u2019s multifamily headwinds. The average monthly rent for Dallas-Fort Worth multifamily projects was down 0.4 percent from the second to the third quarter of 2025 to $1,541 per month, according to a recent report from CBRE. Frisco, a city of more than 200,000 people about 30 miles north of Dallas, is a consistently strong submarket, thanks to its population growth. In 2024, its population jumped 6.9 percent, BridgeInvest\u2019s release shows.\nThe combination of public funding and high-growth submarket is the same recipe JPI recently used to help finance the development of Jefferson Ownsby, a 436-unit apartment complex it\u2019s building in Celina. JPI landed $23.5 million in\nC-PACE funding\n, the state policy-enabled green lending program, for the project at 317 East Ownsby Parkway.\nStryker Properties is a multifamily syndicator based in Plano. Griffon Capital Management is an apartment developer based in Corpus Christi.\n",

        "content": "Elk Grove Village is giving Nexstar Media Group more time to jump-start its long-planned data center redevelopment of the WGN radio transmitter site, pushing the construction deadline to fall 2027 as power issues continue to dog the project.\nVillage officials agreed this week to extend the deadline to begin construction at 720 Rohlwing Road to Sept. 30, 2027, nearly five years after the Irving, Texas-based media company first floated plans to redevelop the property. The core holdup of getting enough electricity to the site hasn\u2019t changed, Mayor Craig Johnson told the Daily Herald, which first\nreported\nthe matter.\nNexstar acquired the 50,000-watt AM station in 2019 and in 2022 proposed selling off the southern 35 acres of the 102-acre property for a three-building\ndata center campus\n, along with an electrical substation and six public pickleball courts to be leased to the Elk Grove Park District. According to the outlet, the plan also called for demolishing and relocating the site\u2019s iconic 750-foot radio tower and its 250-foot backup, while keeping the small transmitter building intact.\nThose plans have since evolved, as Johnson said Nexstar is now envisioning four data center buildings spread across a larger portion of the site and no longer needs to replace the old towers, as radio transmission can be handled through other means. Nexstar declined to detail the revised plan, but said WGN listeners would not lose over-the-air or online service.\nWhen the property was annexed into Elk Grove Village in July 2023, Nexstar signed a redevelopment agreement laying out a phased construction schedule, landscaping buffers and flood control protections for nearby homes, as well as the pickleball courts. Under that deal, construction of the first data center was supposed to begin within two years \u2014 a deadline that has now passed.\nJohnson, an outspoken champion of\ndata centers\n, told the outlet that\nElk Grove Village\nalready hosts 15 facilities, with another 17 proposed. He previously steered Nexstar away from a trucking and logistics concept, arguing data centers would be a better fit next to\nresidential neighborhoods\n.\nA solution to the power situation constraints is progressing. Earlier this month, the village agreed to sell a vacant 1.2-acre parcel at 300 East Devon Avenue to Commonwealth Edison for about $3.6 million. Johnson said the utility has contracts on five neighboring parcels, signaling groundwork for the infrastructure needed to finally bring the data center campus to life.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The former principal of DJE Texas Management Group agreed to plead guilty to wire fraud, capping a fast-moving collapse of a once-active Texas real estate investment firm and setting up a major restitution payment for defrauded investors.\nSan Antonio-based syndicator Devin Elder reached a plea agreement with the U.S. government in the Western District of Texas, according to court filings. While the terms of the deal remain under seal, the documents state that Elder will be required to repay roughly $66 million to investors, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n. The FBI opened a criminal investigation into DJE in 2025, prompting federal authorities to pause a parallel civil case in favor of the\ncriminal probe\n.\nIn charging documents filed Wednesday, prosecutors allege Elder solicited investors nationwide by pitching 10 percent returns and touting conservative deal structures, including claims that properties would be acquired without debt and that investor funds would not be commingled between projects. Prosecutors say those representations were false.\nInstead, Elder allegedly used a bank account under the name \u201cDJE Equity 01, LLC\u201d to disguise the source and movement of investor funds, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. The outlet reported that the government said Elder and DJE used new investor money to make so-called interest payments and other distributions to earlier investors, creating the appearance of successful projects while allegedly concealing cash shortfalls and misuse of funds \u2014 a playbook prosecutors said helped lure additional capital.\nRed flags began surfacing publicly in April 2025, when Elder told investors he planned to lay off staff and sell assets in response to economic headwinds. DJE hired an outside\nconsultant\nto wind down operations, but multiple investors later told the publication that communication had broken down and they feared their capital was gone.\nIn July, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office\nfiled a warrant\nto seize about 1,000 acres of land tied to DJE across six South Texas counties.\nThe criminal case landed on top of a growing pile of lawsuits from vendors and investors alleging breach of contract and fraud. In one high-profile dispute, a buyer of an apartment complex formerly owned by DJE \u2014 Denver-based Platte Canyon Capital \u2014 accused Elder of\nsiphoning rents\nand misrepresenting the property\u2019s financial condition.\nA court hearing has not yet been scheduled. Elder and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A sprawling warehouse on San Antonio\u2019s East Side once billed as the city\u2019s largest industrial development might be headed for an unusual new buyer: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nICE is considering acquiring Oakmont 410, a 639,595-square-foot warehouse at 542 Southeast Loop 410, according to sources\ncited\nby the San Antonio Business Journal. The building, completed in 2022 and owned by Oakmont Industrial Group, has sat vacant despite nearly three years on the lease market.\nMultiple real estate sources told the outlet that\nICE\nis expected to close on the property imminently, though no transaction has yet to be recorded in Bexar County records. Oakmont and ICE did not respond to requests for comment. The property is marketed by Partners Real Estate, whose brokers declined to comment.\nIf the deal goes through, it would align with\nICE\u2019s broader nationwide push\nto secure \u201csubstantially large\u201d warehouse facilities for detainee processing and detention. Another source told the publication that a private contractor is handling site selection for\nICE\n, with one in McAllen also under consideration.\nSimilar searches have surfaced elsewhere: the Kansas City Business Journal recently reported that ICE was evaluating a 920,400-square-foot warehouse there, following a December Washington Post report on the agency\u2019s hunt for warehouse-style facilities across the country.\nD Magazine confirmed a planned\n1-million-square-foot detention\ncenter in Hutchins \u2014 a small town in Dallas County southeast of Dallas, first mentioned in that Washington Post report. The warehouse at 950 North I-45, next to the Hutchins State Jail, is capable of holding up to 9,500 people, more than 10 times the capacity of the nearest ICE facility in Prairieland.\nThe Oakmont building\u2019s zoning could complicate matters. While it carries an industrial designation, that zoning does not allow human occupancy, meaning a special use permit from the city would likely be required if the facility were converted to house detainees, according to the publication. The property did receive a zoning verification letter from the city in December, a common step ahead of a potential sale.\nLocal officials are already signaling resistance. Bexar County Commissioner Tommy Calvert, who represents the area, said he was unaware of ICE\u2019s interest, but forcefully opposed the idea, calling detention facilities \u201cthe most disreputable commercial activity since WWII\u201d and vowing to fight any such use. A spokesperson for District 2 Councilmember Jalen McKee-Rodriguez declined to comment, labeling the reports speculative.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Soon thereafter, they applied for and received city approval to\ndemolish the home\nand build a new residence from the ground up. In 2024, city officials\ndesignated Monroe\u2019s former home\na\nLos Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument\nafter Milstein and Bank\u2019s permits were already approved.\n\u201cIn doing so, the city has turned the property into a tourist attraction, attracting (as the city wanted and expected) traffic congestion on the short, narrow dead-end street adjacent to the property along with numerous trespassers leaping over and onto property walls to get into the \u201cdesignated\u201d house (which cannot be seen from the public realm due to the property wall and landscaping),\u201d the court filings state, according to the Post.\nAs a result of the heightened interest around the home, the homeowners claim that burglars searching for memorabilia broke into the home in November. They even had to hire their own private security for the property.\nMilstein and Bank said that the city never worked to deem the building historically significant in the decades since Monroe\u2019s death after it changed hands multiple times and underwent several renovations. By declaring the structure a historic-cultural monument, the city \u201crendered the property useless,\u201d the couple said.\nThe homeowners are asking the court to either allow them to proceed with their demolition plans or force the city to pay them the value of the home.

        "content": "Even an office building built for pandemic realities isn\u2019t immune to tenant downsizing.\nCosmetic laser company Alma Lasers listed its 10,600 square-foot space on the fifth floor of the office building called Fulton East in Chicago\u2019s trendy Fulton Market neighborhood. The lease has three years remaining, according to the Cushman &amp; Wakefield listing for the space.\nThe downsizing is the first setback for the building at 215 North Peoria Street, owned and developed by Chicago-based Parkside Realty. In 2020, the newly completed Fulton East building made headlines for incorporating high-tech, health-focused amenities to combat the spread of Covid, such as full building air purification, touchless elevators and antibacterial interior paint.\nThe building\u2019s scale and location were also well-suited to shifts in office trends. At 12 stories and 90,000 square feet, Fulton East is generally easier to fill than the massive skyscrapers languishing in the Chicago loop, like the city\u2019s largest office building,\nthe Willis Tower\n.\nFulton East first reached\nfull occupancy in June 2023\n.\nAlma Lasers, a subsidiary of Israel-based Sisram Medical Group, hired Chicago-based general contractor Redmond to build out space on the first and ninth floors of the Fulton East building in 2023. The first floor is an Alma-owned MedSpa called Sisram Wellness Center, and the ninth floor serves as space for the company\u2019s corporate offices. Alma later hired Redmond again to build out additional office space on the fifth floor, according to Redmond\u2019s website.\nThe status of the fifth floor work is unclear. Redmond\u2019s website describes fifth floor construction as completed in 2025, but the Cushman &amp; Wakefield sublease listing posted earlier this month states that the space is \u201ccurrently under construction.\u201d\nCushman &amp; Wakefield brokers Jeffrey Skender and Jonathan Metzl are representing the landlord. Skender, Metzl and representatives of Alma, Redmond and Parkside did not respond to requests for comment.\nOver the past 10 years, Fulton Market has transformed from a meatpacking hub to a mixed-use district filled with loft office space and trendy bars, restaurants and stores. As a result, it leads the city in office leasing, as tenants search for buildings that draw employees out of the home office with amenities and nearby attractions. In the last quarter of 2025, Fulton Market had a 16.8 percent vacancy rate, compared to a 26.6 percent vacancy rate in the city overall, according to CBRE.\nYet, since the pandemic, some\ntenants have been scaling back\nin the trendy neighborhood.\nHealthcare software company Waystar and employer review platform Glassdoor\nboth listed a combined 63,000 square feet\nof sublease space in Fulton Market in early 2024.\nOther companies that listed sublease space in the neighborhood around the same time included\npublic relations firm WPP\n, upscale coffee and snack retailer Foxtrot, tech company Hologram,\nadvisory firm Kroll\nand food packaging company\nHazel Technologies\n.\nStill, interest from prospective new tenants remains high.\nMcLean, Virginia-based candy giant\nMars reached an agreement\nto lease a large space at Trammell Crow\u2019s office building at 400 North Aberdeen Street in Fulton Market last month. Those familiar with the deal said the company is expected to lease over 100,000 square feet of space.",

        "content": "Yet another artificial intelligence-powered company is\nexpanding its office footprint\nin San Francisco.\nIntercom, a locally based tech firm that makes AI customer service software,\nleased\napproximately 45,000 square feet of offices at 85 Second Street in the Financial District, the San Francisco Business Times reported. The firm isn\u2019t moving far from its current 40,000 square feet at the KPMG Building next door at 55 Second Street.\nIntercom was reportedly expected to renew its lease at 55 Second Street, according to sources close to the matter cited by the Business Times. Paramount Group, a Manhattan-based investor that operates the building, reportedly couldn\u2019t keep up with its timeline for completing the renewal, leading Intercom to sign the lease at 85 Second, per the Business Times.\nThe AI firm\u2019s departure from 55 Second Street marks the latest exit from the building.\nKPMG, the building\u2019s namesake tenant, announced in late 2024 that it planned to move out of the structure in September this year. The professional services firm will relocate into a new 96,296-square-foot space at 505 Howard Street, the Business Times\nreported\n. Workforce management software company Rippling signed a lease to shift its headquarters to 430 California Street from 55 Second in June 2024.\nThe 380,000-square-foot 55 Second Street is backed by a $187.5 million loan that matures in October. Last year, Paramount\u2019s lenders\nlisted the debt for sale\n, though no deal for the loan has emerged yet.\nAI companies like Intercom have been key players in\ndriving demand for office space\nin post-pandemic San Francisco. Earlier this week, news surfaced that Decagon, another AI-powered customer service company, is\nin negotiations\nto lease approximately 70,000 square feet at 680 Folsom Street.\nOverall, vacant or available office space in San Francisco decreased by nearly 2 million square feet last quarter, making for the steepest\ndrop in office availability\nin four consecutive quarters of decline. Companies, many of them tech and AI firms, leased more than 1 million more square feet that they vacated in the fourth quarter, marking the biggest rate of positive absorption since 2018.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Gary Barnett is having a moment in Midtown, and it\u2019s not just\nabout new construction\n.\nWithin days, the Extell Development founder popped up on two very different fronts: quietly\nlocking up one of the most consequential development assemblages on Park Avenue\nand winning a court ruling that clears the way for him to\npotentially take control of a deeply distressed office tower\nowned by rivals SL Green and RXR.\nTogether, the moves underscore Barnett\u2019s playbook in a market still working through pain: lean into prime locations, exploit dislocation and don\u2019t shy away from conflict.\nOn the growth side, Barnett is\nin contract\nto buy 405-415 Park Avenue, air rights from Central Synagogue and is negotiating for the adjacent office building at 110 East 55th Street, according to people familiar with the deal.\nSellers were shopping the pieces for north of $500 million, The Promote first reported, and the combined site could support roughly 700,000 square feet with additional air rights. The assemblage sits just steps from JPMorgan Chase\u2019s new 270 Park headquarters and near Citadel and Vornado\u2019s planned 350 Park tower, placing it squarely in the corridor where trophy office capital is concentrated.\nAt the same time, Barnett is pressing his advantage on the other end of the market. A state Supreme Court judge this week\ndenied\nSL Green and RXR\u2019s attempt to block a UCC foreclosure auction tied to Worldwide Plaza, clearing the way for Extell to move forward after quietly acquiring the senior mezzanine debt.\nThe owners had argued the auction was a sham designed to hand Barnett the keys. The judge disagreed, emphasizing that sophisticated parties are bound by the contracts they sign.\nWorldwide Plaza is a case study in office distress: roughly 40 percent vacant after Cravath\u2019s exit, burdened by nearly $1 billion in senior CMBS debt and now headed toward a mezz sale where Extell is the only qualified bidder. Control of the debt would give Barnett enormous leverage over the 1.8 million-square-foot tower\u2019s future.\nTaken together, the Park Avenue assemblage and the Worldwide Plaza fight show Barnett operating on two tracks at once \u2014 assembling blue-chip dirt for the next cycle while using debt to pry opportunities out of this one.\nIn a bifurcated Midtown market, he\u2019s betting both ends will pay off.\nGary Barnett isn\u2019t the only one making news in New York City real estate this week. Here are other top stories of the week:\n\u201cCheap hookers\u201d: Email from Tal Alexander revealed in Hamptons accuser\u2019s cross-examination\nThe third day of the Alexander brothers\u2019 sex trafficking trial focused on the cross-examination of Maya Miller, a woman who accused Tal Alexander of raping her in the Hamptons in 2014.\nProsecutors allege Oren, Alon and Tal engaged in a\nconspiracy to commit sex trafficking\nfrom 2008 to 2021, including drugging and sexually assaulting women. The brothers have denied the allegations and pleaded not guilty to the charges.\nAlso, check out\nthe first episode\nof our documentary on the Alexander brothers.\nFictitious deals and phony emails: New Nussbaum filings lay bare alleged Ponzi scheme\nDisgraced attorney Mark Nussbaum admitted in legal filings to diverting $336 million from his law firm\u2019s escrow clients to real estate investor Mendel Steiner and his family between 2022 and 2025 as part of an alleged Ponzi scheme.\nThe filings reveal Nussbaum directly transferred $24 million to Steiner or his family\u2019s companies, and an additional $68 million was routed to his family via Steiner\u2019s companies, Aven Realty and Real Green Management, which also paid Nussbaum $104 million.\nCarmel Partners buys piece of $500M UWS apartment portfolio\nRon Zeff\u2019s Carmel Partners is buying into a $500 million\nmultifamily portfolio\nthat was pitched as an investment shielded from a potential\nrent freeze\nunder Mayor Zohran Mamdani.\nThe investment firm is nearing a deal to buy MetLife\u2019s minority stake in a five-building, 710-unit portfolio near Columbus Circle. Four of the five buildings are free market and the fifth is subject to an\nolder 421a agreement\nunder which an owner could raise rents by 47 percent before hitting legal rent limits.\nEli Karp sues Greystone, BBG over alleged \u201cloan-to-own\u201d appraisal scheme\nDeveloper Eli Karp is suing lender Greystone and appraisal firm BBG, alleging they engineered a \u201cloan-to-own\u201d scheme by intentionally overvaluing his 271 Lenox Road apartment building.\nThe suit claims BBG\u2019s 2019 appraisal of $46.2 million was used to lure Karp into a $34.5 million bridge loan; a subsequent 2024 appraisal valued the property at $29.6 million, which Karp uses as evidence of fraudulent inflation.\nAfter defaulting, the property sold at foreclosure for $10 million, leaving Karp responsible for a $15 million personal guarantee.\nHe is seeking $16.6 million in damages for the alleged appraisal inflation and an additional $122 million from Greystone for lost opportunities.\nCouncil revives two housing regulation bills, COPA remains vetoed\nFinally, the City Council overrode 17 of former Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 vetoes, including two housing regulation bills that set minimum percentages for homeownership and low-income units in city-financed projects.\nThe Council, however, did not override the veto of the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act, though the bill\u2019s sponsor plans to reintroduce the measure.\nOther vetoes reversed included measures to set minimum wages for building security guards, increase transparency in the co-op application process and create a city-run land bank.\n",

        "content": "With fresh snow piled high and temperatures below freezing, reporters with\nThe Real Deal\ntrudged to a Lower Manhattan courthouse this week to watch the Alexanders brothers\u2019 federal sex trafficking unfold.\nThe proceedings marked the culmination of nearly two years of reporting on allegations that disgraced brokers Tal and Oren Alexander and Oren\u2019s twin brother, Alon Alexander, sexually assaulted multiple women. The brothers were arrested in December 2024 on federal sex trafficking charges and have remained in custody at a Brooklyn jail since January 2025.\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s happened so far.\nProsecutors with the Southern District of New York\nkicked off Tuesday\nwith an opening statement detailing their case against the brothers, including accusing them of working together between 2008 and 2021 to lure women to destinations like the Hamptons and the Bahamas with the promise of luxury travel and exclusive experiences. However, once the women arrived, they were sexually assaulted and, in some cases, drugged by one or more of the brothers, prosecutors allege.\nDefense attorneys pushed back against prosecutors\u2019 characterization of the brothers\u2019 lifestyle, arguing instead that the brothers\u2019 womanizing behavior was \u201ccrude\u201d but not criminal. They also challenged prosecutors\u2019 allegations that the Alexanders drugged women to attack them, pointing to a lack of toxicology or medical reports to corroborate accusers\u2019 claims. (\n about opening statements here\n.)\nTwo women took the stand this week. One testified on Tuesday under the pseudonym \u201cKatie Moore\u201d to describe how she met Tal and Alon at a 2012 NBA Championships watch party at actor Zac Efron\u2019s apartment before she was drugged while at a nightclub with the brothers. She told the court she blacked out and woke up naked in a bed with Alon standing over her. She said he laughed when she told him she didn\u2019t want to have sex and told her she already had. She alleges he then raped her again. (\nRead the story on her testimony here\n.)\nOn Wednesday,\na woman using the pseudonym \u201cMaya Miller\u201d recounted her claim that she was drugged and raped by Tal in the Hamptons in August 2014. She claimed that on her second night at a weekend trip in a Sag Harbor mansion, she felt the mood shift and began to fear for her and her friend\u2019s safety. As Miller was trying to leave the next morning, she claimed Tal cornered her in the shower and raped her. (\nRead the story on her testimony here\n.)\nAttorneys representing the defendants cross-examined each alleged victim, questioning both women on who they told and when, including pressing Miller on why she didn\u2019t seek help from her friend, who was in the bathroom while she was allegedly being attacked by Tal in the shower.\nAttorneys also questioned the women about their alcohol consumption, including their prior habits and leading up to the alleged rapes. Howard Srebnick, an attorney for Alon, asked Moore several questions about the \u201clittle bit\u201d of MDMA she admitted to taking early on in the night.\nBy Thursday, the proceedings\nhad touched on allegations concerning\neach of the three brothers, including the start of testimony related to a sexual exploitation of a minor charge that Oren is facing over an alleged rape in 2009 captured on video. Prosecutors wrapped up the week by walking jurors through a series of photos and videos taken on the night of the alleged attack.\nThe Alexanders, their attorneys and\nTRD\nwill be back in the courtroom on Monday, when the woman depicted in the video is expected to testify.\nNot so fast\u2026\nBrooklyn\u2019s ultra-luxury market\nhit a growth spurt\nlast year, though it\u2019s still trailing behind its golden years following the pandemic.\nIn 2025, the borough notched 12 deals for $10 million or more, up 50 percent from 8 the previous year, according to\nCompass\u2019 annual report\n. The sales totaled $143 million, up 34 percent year-over-year from $107 million.\nDespite the uptick, the market is still down from 2022, a banner year for Brooklyn\u2019s luxury deals as buyers flocked to the outer boroughs in the wake of the pandemic. That year, 13 deals closed for homes priced at $10 million or more for a volume of more than $170 million.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe most expensive sale to hit the city rolls this week was for two adjacent townhouses in the West Village. New York University\u2019s Law School sold the pair of properties at 63 and 65 Charles Street for $33.4 million. The buyer was an anonymous LLC with an address in the Cayman Islands.\n",

        "content": "New York City is a dangerous place for birds.\nFor the second year in a row, a record number of migrating birds were killed after flying headfirst into the city\u2019s nearly invisible skyline, according to the\nNew York Post\n. At least 1,250 warblers, flickers and other birds died during their annual fall migration, surpassing last year\u2019s grim record of nearly 1,000. And conservationists say the true toll is likely far higher, thanks to an unusually heavy migration season that sent thousands more birds through the five boroughs.\nCity Hall has come up with at least one answer \u2014 bird-friendly glass. In 2021, Local Law 15 went into effect, requiring most new buildings and major renovations to use bird-safe materials on 90 percent of their facade up to the first 75 feet, the danger zone where birds are most likely to collide with glass.\nThe idea is simple \u2014 make buildings visible to birds and fewer of them will die. On paper, it\u2019s hard to argue with that. Fewer dead birds is a clear win.\nBut the law also comes with a price tag, and that\u2019s where the debate gets complicated. Related Companies\u2019 Jeff Blau recently pointed to an affordable housing project he\u2019s building at Willets Point, where complying with the bird-glass requirement will cost roughly $2 million. Those extra costs, Blau argued, could otherwise go toward building more apartments. The development is subsidized by the city, he added, so it\u2019s helping foot the bill.\n\u201cThe city is paying the money for bird glass instead of more affordable apartments,\u201d Blau said at last month\u2019s NYU Schack capital markets conference. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense.\u201d\nIt\u2019s an uncomfortable tradeoff. Saving wildlife is important. So is building housing in a city with a chronic shortage. When the same public dollars are funding both, it\u2019s fair to ask whether the policy is delivering the biggest bang for its buck.\nConservation advocates counter that prices for bird-friendly glass have fallen as demand has grown, and that the upfront cost can help building owners avoid expensive repairs from bird collisions or the potential cost to retrofit existing buildings. The Council introduced a new bill in 2024 that would require most landlords to comply with bird-friendly standards in existing buildings by 2030.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a challenge in a city like this, with housing so scarce and the need for affordable housing so great,\u201d said Jessica Wilson of NYC Bird Alliance. \u201cThere are many benefits to protecting birds and saving biodiversity, including improving human health and mental well-being.\u201d\nGlass is one of several threats to birds. Advocates support complementary measures like turning off unused lights at night to reduce bird deaths. Public education about lighting rules or even investing in habitat restoration could arguably save more birds per dollar spent, but conservationists argue that these broader strategies don\u2019t replace the need for bird-friendly building measures.\n\u201cBirds and biodiversity are a critical part of a sustainable and resilient city, and when you make the city better for wildlife, [you] make it healthier and a better place for people also,\u201d Wilson said.\nNone of this is an argument against protecting wildlife. New York can love birds and build housing at the same time. The question is whether bird glass, as currently mandated, is the smartest way to do both.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nAI voice analytics company Rilla inked a 57,000-square-foot lease this month at Global Holdings\u2019\n25 Kent\nin Williamsburg in one of the borough\u2019s biggest office deals of the past year. Leases of that size are rare for Class A buildings in the borough, where last year\u2019s\nbiggest signings\nlargely landed in Class B and C towers. Could the AI boom finally give Brooklyn\u2019s top-tier office market a lift? Send a note to\nelizabeth.cryan@therealdeal.com\nwith your thoughts.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nSome people have pet nannies. I know this because a listing for a full-time nanny for a four-year-old Lagotto Romagnolo in my Brooklyn neighborhood recently surfaced on my Instagram feed. The link led to the profile page for staffing agency\nHousehold Staffing\n, where I found multiple listings for pet nannies, both live-in and live-out.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 President Trump announced on Friday that he has picked lawyer and former Federal Reserve official Kevin Warsh to be the next chairman of the central bank, according to the\nNew York Times\n. If confirmed, Warsh would succeed Jerome Powell, who has faced attacks from Trump over his reluctance to cut interest rates more aggressively. Powell\u2019s term as chair ends in May.\n\u2014 Mayor Zohran Mamdani has called an AI chatbot released by the Adams administration \u201cfunctionally unusable,\u201d\nreports\nThe City. The software was intended to provide business owners with information about city rules and other pertinent information. Previous reporting found the chatbot giving erroneous information that could have caused businesses to make illegal decisions. Now, Mamdani says his administration is axing the program as part of cost-cutting.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$9.9 million\nfor 211 West 84th Street, 5C. The Upper West Side condo at The Henry is 3,400 square feet of new construction.\nCompass\u2019\nAlexa Lambert, Alison Black and Elizabeth Goss have the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$17.7 million\nfor 35-25 Steinway Street. The Astoria building has three units and is 18,400 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $23.9 million for 116 East 70th Street. The Lenox Hill townhome is 5,700 square feet.\nSloane Square\u2019s\nVicki Warner has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 27,242-square-foot, eight-story, 10-family, mixed-use building at 717 Myrtle Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Nikolai Katz Architect is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "Sometimes when the lights come on at the club, you finally see just who you were dancing with.\nThat\u2019s how unsecured creditors of bankrupt nightclub Brooklyn Mirage might be feeling. The group pulled its support for a bankruptcy plan that would have\nsold the venue\nto Axar Capital Management LLC after finding out the debt fund had struck a deal with a third party. The withdrawal was first reported by\nBloomberg Law\n.\nThe unsecured creditors appear to have first heard about the deal in the pages of BKMAG, which\nreported\non New Year\u2019s Day that Axar was expecting to enter a deal with global nightlife brand Pacha and its parent FIVE to sell the Mirage and turn it into Pacha New York. BKMAG attributed the information to an anonymous industry source.\nThe about-face by creditors is the latest twist in a saga that seemed to finally be coming to an end. The popular venue Brooklyn Mirage, owned by the company Avant Gardner, began undergoing a comprehensive renovation in 2024. It sold a season of tickets for the following year and then canceled every show. The debacle ultimately ended in Avant Gardner\u2019s parent company filing for bankruptcy last August, reporting $153.3 million in funded debt obligations.\nAn Axar affiliate won court approval in October to buy the Mirage stage and other assets from Avant Gardner in a $110 million credit bid, according to Bloomberg Law. Creditors would get a payout if Axar was able to reach a certain monetary threshold.\nAxar, meanwhile, allegedly negotiated the deal with Pacha\u2019s parent in the dark, away from the eyes of creditors and the court.\nAfter learning of\nthe plans in the news\n, the creditors approached Axar\u2019s counsel, who allegedly said the reports were incorrect, although discussions were allegedly ongoing. Then, on January 12, the creditors\u2019 attorney was allegedly told the deal was all but done.\nThe creditors will not sign off on any plan that permits the \u201ctrickery Axar has attempted,\u201d they wrote to the court. The deal \u201cdestroys the value\u201d of parts of the plan and Axar hasn\u2019t permitted the terms of the deal to be shared with the Delaware bankruptcy court or with the Mirage parent\u2019s board of directors.\nThe affiliate\u2019s deal with Pacha and its parent FIVE includes a purchase option that, if exercised, would wipe out a potential payout to the unsecured creditors. The creditors include vendors and artists who worked with the club.\nAxar has asked the court to determine that the creditors are unreasonably withholding their support. Axar is pursuing the demolition and rebuilding of the Mirage, but needs a partner to finance the process as well as $2 million in monthly costs for the closed stages.\nThe creditors can\u2019t turn around and fight a plan they once endorsed just because their assumption that they would get a payout turned out to be false, Axar argued to the court.\n\u201c[N]o party submitted a proposal valuing the enterprise higher than the offer from the venue management firm,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cThis is the unfortunate reality all of the parties have to live with.\u201d\nAxar did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe Avant Gardner complex that included the Mirage was one of the largest clubs in New York, at 80,000 square feet. The Mirage opened in East Williamsburg in 2017 and became a popular venue for electronic music, despite fights with the state liquor license authority and community board.\nIn 2024, the company brought on new CEO Josh Wyatt to manage a revamp of the Mirage stage. The club closed for what was supposed to be a massive renovation. But just before it was supposed to open for a full summer of shows, the city\u2019s buildings department yanked its permit.\nAlthough Mirage owners said the venue was show-ready, the buildings commissioner told Brooklyn Paper the revamp was \u201ccombustible\u201d and \u201cillegal.\u201d As shows were canceled, 90,000 ticketholders were left at least temporarily in the lurch. Wyatt was fired in May of 2025, and Avant Gardner filed for bankruptcy three months later.\nA confirmation hearing for the bankruptcy plan is currently scheduled for February 12.\n",

        "content": "IMC Equity Group bought a Princeton apartment complex for nearly 24 percent less than its sale price four years ago, as the investment firm capitalizes on distress in South Florida.\nNorth Miami-based IMC Equity, led by Yoram Izhak, bought the 204-unit garden-style Pine Groves at 24101 South Dixie Highway in unincorporated Miami-Dade County from an entity led by Elliot Kazarnovsky of Toronto-based Marlin Spring Developments, according to records.\nIMC Equity borrowed a $27.8 million loan from Wells Fargo for the purchase and property.\nCompleted in 2020, Pine Groves consists of four three-story buildings and a clubhouse on a nearly 6-acre lot, property records show. It has one- and two-bedroom units, with monthly rents ranging from $1,635 to $1,925.\nThe Kazarnovsky-led entity, which is in the care of Marlin Spring US Realty, bought Pine Groves from the developer in 2021 for $44 million.\nThe discounted sale comes amid higher interest rates, increases in other costs and a slower South Florida multifamily market compared with the pandemic-induced boom.\nThe elevated rates have translated to higher debt obligations for landlords with floating-rate loans and more expensive refinancing for those with maturing loans. At the same time, South Florida has experienced skyrocketing insurance premiums and stabilizing though still-high costs for labor and materials.\nMeanwhile, demand for rentals has cooled. After South Florida became a magnet for out-of-staters, creating unprecedented apartment demand and record rent growth, developers rushed to build multifamily. They completed a record 18,600 units last year, outpacing net leasing, just as the influx of residents slowed, prompting a decrease in rents and an increase in concessions.\nSome multifamily properties have traded at a discount. In September, Waterton Residential sold the 427-unit District West Gables complex at 2001 and 2101 Ludlam Road/Southwest 67th Avenue in West Miami for $111 million, a\n4.7 percent\ndiscount from what it had paid nearly a decade ago.\nIMC Equity is among the firms seizing on the distress playing out in multifamily and other property types. It bought the 515,000-square-foot Sawgrass Technology Park in Sunrise for\n$49 million\nin 2024, marking a 34 percent discount from its 2019 price.\u00a0It also bagged the Miracle Marketplace at 3301 Coral Way in Miami in 2024 for\n$62 million\n, or 32.6 percent less than the retail center\u2019s price over a decade prior.\n",

        "content": "Embattled South Side home flipper Chris Urban clapped back against the storm of foreclosures surrounding dozens of his properties in legal filings this month, as more lenders took him to court over unpaid debts.\nUrban and his sister, Aneta Urban, have been named in a\ngrowing number of foreclosures\nand lawsuits related to a portfolio of dozens of properties across Chicago\u2019s South Side and south suburbs that started to buckle under the weight of unpaid debts in 2024. The pair borrowed money from fellow investors in a real estate training program run by Andrew Holmes, who is\nalso suing them for fraud\n.\nIn filings across several lawsuits in January, the Urbans argued their lenders failed to credit payments received, either directly or indirectly, to reduce the amount the Urbans owed the lenders. The filings argue the amount the Urbans owe should be offset by any money the lenders received from selling any collateral or other payments from the Urbans.\nAlthough the Urbans didn\u2019t provide proof of payments to the lenders, they denied the amount that the lenders claim is owed and demanded \u201cstrict proof\u201d of the accounting in the filings.\nThe argument reflects the precarious financing of the Urbans\u2019 portfolio. As financial troubles mounted in 2024 and 2025, Chris Urban used short sales to give lenders partial payments while using other properties as collateral for unpaid debts,\nThe Real Deal previously reported\n. In other cases, Urban would sell a home from one LLC to another he operates, satisfying one mortgage while taking out another for the purchase, property records show.\nThe defense comes as the Urbans are facing foreclosures on more than 80 properties between lender Renovo Financial and a handful of private lenders, amounting to millions in debt. While some lawsuits from early last year have been resolved, foreclosure suits continued to pile up late last year.\nMeanwhile, business loan company OnDeck Capital brought a third lawsuit for unpaid debt against one of Urban\u2019s LLCs in November. American Express also filed a lawsuit against the same LLC, and a separate one against Chris Urban personally, alleging he defaulted on debt, in January.\nChris Urban declined to comment, saying he would resolve the disputes \u201cthrough the courts, not the media.\u201d\nNew foreclosure\nSince mid-October, lenders have brought two more lawsuits against the Urbans for alleged unpaid debts. In both cases, the Urbans filed the same defenses, arguing the lenders did not credit any repayment they had received to the loan balance.\nIn October, Shirley Pollock, through her LLC Best Funding Solutions, filed to foreclose on five properties in Chicago and Calumet Park where she loaned the Urbans money. Pollock\u2019s lawsuit claims the combined unpaid debt, including late fees, amounts to more than $1 million across the five properties.\nAt three of those homes, the Urbans took out second mortgages between $50,000 and $65,000 with two other lenders \u2014 Homes by MB and Misener Wealth Builder \u2014 that are also named as defendants.\nIt\u2019s the second foreclosure suit from Pollock, following a lawsuit earlier that same month alleging unpaid debts of almost $500,000 across three properties.\nShe is also named as a defendant in the lawsuit brought by Holmes and his business partner, Mary DeSloover, alleging fraud. That\nlawsuit argues Pollock aided\nthe Urbans in covering up their financial pitfalls as they took on more debt from other investors. Pollock has denied the charge and said she is also a victim of the Urbans in legal filings.\nPollock did not respond to a request for comment.\nOlmos Private Equity\nAnother lender, Edmund Olmos, is also moving to seize two of Chris Urban\u2019s properties through foreclosure.\nThrough his LLC, Olmos Private Equity, Olmos issued Urban a $150,000 mortgage for a home on Burley Avenue and $236,000 for a home on 88th street in 2023 and 2024. The lawsuit alleges Urban failed to pay back the loans when they matured, and the balance has grown to more than $468,000.\nUrban took out a second mortgage at both those properties, records show. Olmos issued mortgages to the Urbans on more than a dozen properties between 2023 and 2024, often as second mortgages, property records show.\nMitchell Lieberman, an attorney for Olmos Private Equity and other investors foreclosing on the Urbans\u2019 properties, did not respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "Rumors have been swirling for months in San Francisco, with C-suite executives, broker agents and private equity managers speculating that Michael Shvo might soon be out from the Transamerica Pyramid, the emblematic piece of city skyline that is now firmly linked to the brash developer\u2019s persona.\nThe San Francisco Standard and the San Francisco Chronicle each published stories attempting to drill down on the rumors, and both reported growing discontent with Shvo and his eponymous development company, SHVO, among the institutional German investors who have financed the acquisition and renovations that returned the pyramid to its premiere status.\nThe outlets say Bayerische Versorgungskammer (BVK), Germany\u2019s largest public pension group, and investment firm Deutsche Finance Group, have moved to oust Shvo as the asset manager, citing waning confidence against the backdrop of a series of recent issues involving Shvo, including his\ndramatic exit from the Raleigh Hotel development\nin Miami Beach, defaulting on a $200 million loan that led to the sale-in-lieu-of-foreclosure\nat the Mandarin Oriental in Beverly Hills\n, and\nan ongoing lawsuit with Core Club\n. In November, the Core Club filed a lawsuit against Shvo\naccusing him of being engaged in a yearslong\nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) conspiracy.\nBVK has reportedly faced pressure from its members to clean up its U.S. strategy after the fund apparently lost more $1 billion on its American investments, some of which involve Shvo. Deutsche Finance Group told the Chronicle that BVK was \u201ccurrently reviewing the appointment of a new operating asset manager for the U.S. real estate portfolio as part of a structured selection process.\u201d However, the group did not specify that this involved Shvo.\nA spokesperson for SHVO has rejected the reporting as \u201cfalse.\u201d Last week, SHVO announced three new leases at the Transamerica Pyramid. One of the leases, for 4,000 square feet, went for more than $300 per square foot, according to the announcement,\nwhich allegedly set a West Coast record for office space\n. The new contracts put the Transamerica Pyramid at 85 percent leased.\nOf note: Shvo has tapped Goldin Solutions, a PR firm that, among other things, specializes in crisis communications. Goldin Solutions has managed the media strategy for the likes of WeWork founder Adam Neumann, Gawker Media during the Hulk Hogan trial, a branch of the Sackler family amidst the opioid crisis, and former Today Show host Billy Bush following fallout from then-presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s Access Hollywood tapes.\nCould California get another governor with mayoral experience?\nMatt Mahan, the first-term mayor of San Jose, has thrown his hat into an already crowded but uninspiring field for California governor.\nMahan, 43, is a Harvard graduate who got his start as a tech entrepreneur before waging a successful campaign for San Jose City Council in 2020. Mid-way through his first term, he jumped into the mayor\u2019s race and edged out political veteran Cindy Chavez for the seat. He now looks to continue his streak of first-term political promotions.\nIn a state with a wide left-of-center political spectrum, Mahan has fashioned himself as a moderate and pragmatist, cut in a similar shape as San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie. Mahan has hyperfocused on housing, homelessness, and crime during his three years at the helm.\nHe sponsored a change to the city\u2019s camping ordinance that allowed police to arrest and charge unhoused who camp on public property and repeatedly refuse shelter. Under Mahan, San Jose was the first city to opt-in to a state law that allowed homeowners to sell accessory dwelling units at condos, and this week the San Jose City Council unanimously approved a series of changes that lower affordability thresholds on developers and clear expensive bureaucratic hurdles to convert empty downtown offices buildings into housing. He racked up potential campaign talking points on public-safety as the most prominent Democrat to take on Gov. Gavin Newsom in campaigning for 2024\u2019s Prop 36, which sought to employ harsher penalties for crimes of desperation, such as drug offenses and theft. Nearly 70 percent of voters supported the measure. He has supported adding officers to the San Jose Police Department.\nMahan also made a splash last summer when he called out Newsom\u2019s high-profile communications strategy of mirroring Trump\u2019s rambling, petulant and often petty approach to social media.\n\u201cMaintaining our success requires a relentless focus on the facts in the real world, not a blind leap into meme land,\u201d Mahan wrote in an\nAugust op-ed for the San Francisco Standard\n.\nThe mayor\u2019s entrance into the race has already earned a ringing endorsement from one of the state\u2019s most powerful developers, Rick Caruso.\nCaruso wrote on X\nthat he \u201cencouraged\u201d Mahan to run, \u201cand I\u2019m delighted he is entering the race.\u201d\nMany believe Mahan\u2019s campaign will benefit from his ties to the tech community, for which San Jose has remained at the center of gravity. Shortly after Mahan\u2019s announcement, Garry Tan, president and CEO of the \u00fcberinfluential Silicon Valley tech accelerator Y Combinator, posted on X that the\nSan Jose mayor was \u201cthe real deal.\u201d\n\u201cCalifornia desperately needs this. Not more vibes. Not more trolling. RESULTS,\u201d Tan wrote.\nMahan enters a race that includes Rep. Eric Swalwell, former gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter, former state attorney general and U.S. health and human services secretary Xavier Beccera, billionaire entrepreneur Tom Steyer, and former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, among others.\n",

        "content": "The Alexander brothers\u2019 sex trafficking trial began last week in a Manhattan courtroom.\nThe proceedings may be more than 1,200 miles away from Miami, but the city looms large in the case.\nAnd, in the days leading up to the trial, a Miami woman alleged in a\nnew lawsuit\nthat in 2016 she was raped by Oren and Alon \u201csimultaneously,\u201d with the brothers switching off who was filming on a cell phone. The woman, Tiffany Rodriguez, also names the nightclub, Basement at the Edition Miami Beach; the brothers\u2019 parents, Orly and Shlomy; the family\u2019s security firm, Kent Security; Oren\u2019s longtime brokerage, Douglas Elliman; and the firm\u2019s former chairman and CEO, Howard Lorber, as defendants.\nThe brothers have denied all allegations and pleaded not guilty to the federal charges.\nThe federal trial began a day late because of the winter storm that brought more than a foot of snow to New York.\nAlon\u2019s attorney Howard Srebnick, the only Miami lawyer involved in the federal case, walked into the courthouse with two coconut waters in his backpack. The brothers\u2019 parents, Orly and Shlomy, attended the trial each day, as did Shani Alexander, Alon\u2019s wife. Kamila Hansen Alexander, Oren\u2019s wife, showed up on Thursday in a long fur coat.\nThe brothers, who face a minimum of 15 years in prison if convicted, could be seen scanning the courtroom throughout the week. Oren and Alon whispered to their attorneys during cross-examination, likely guiding their lawyers\u2019 questions. Family members spoke Hebrew to each other, and were warned by the court officers to not speak or whisper.\nThe brothers\u2019 attorney said that the Alexanders were \u201csingle men who liked and pursued women.\u201d Oren\u2019s lawyer, Teny Geragos, described them as \u201carrogant.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not trafficking. That\u2019s dating,\u201d she said.\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are working to paint a picture of the brothers enticing women with promises of luxury travel, only to then allegedly drug and rape them.\n\u201cThe brothers used whatever means necessary. Sometimes drugs, sometimes alcohol, sometimes brute force to carry out their rapes. Some of their victims were underage. Some said no. Some were incoherent,\u201d said Assistant U.S. Attorney Madison Smyser in her opening remarks. \u201cFor over a decade, these three brothers, the defendants, masqueraded as party boys, when really they were predators.\u201d\nTwo women testified last week using pseudonyms: Katie Moore, who alleged that Alon raped her in 2012 after meeting him at Zac Efron\u2019s apartment for an NBA championship watch party, and Maya Miller, who alleged that Tal raped her in the Hamptons one weekend in 2014. [Read Moore\u2019s account\nhere\nand Miller\u2019s\nhere\n.]\nIn the two years after Miller\u2019s alleged rape, she and a friend stayed at the homes of people in Tal\u2019s orbit, said Milton Williams, Tal\u2019s attorney. That included the homes of Max Leifer and Jim Ferraro. Ferraro, a prominent mesothelioma attorney based in Miami, gave Oren his big break when he hired him to represent him in the $8.2 million sale of his Park Imperial penthouse in the summer of 2009. Ferraro also briefly represented Oren and Alon in the initial two civil lawsuits alleging rape.\nThe prosecution also called friends of the women to the stand, as well as an FBI agent and a New York Police Department detective involved in the case.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWill other owners at Five Park join a penthouse buyer who recently\nsued the developers\nof the Miami Beach tower? A trust is alleging that luxury short-term guest suites were promised to unit owners in marketing materials, but that the developers are now offering them for sale.

        "content": "Fannie Mae says it is seeing fewer cases of multifamily mortgage fraud following a years-long crackdown, a finding that surprised some market watchers who say misconduct may be shifting elsewhere rather than disappearing.\nThe government-supported mortgage giant reported that tips and investigations into multifamily fraud have fallen to 12-month lows, according to a partially redacted analysis published by its regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency.\nThe decline follows a sharp surge in reported activity just a year earlier. Fannie said it received a flood of tips related to multifamily mortgage fraud in 2024, prompting 193 investigations, up from 14 in 2022. The agency confirmed fraud in 87 cases last year, compared with just three two years earlier.\nFannie said those numbers are now trending down, noting it did not find any potential fraud in its sample of 44 high-risk loans between September 2024 and January 2025. As of July 2025, multifamily mortgage fraud tips and investigations at Fannie were at their lowest levels in a year.\nThe findings were part of an analysis by the FHFA, that examined Fannie\u2019s allowance for loan losses, or the amount of money Fannie is setting aside to cover losses. Fannie, which does not originate loans but buys loans from private lenders, set aside\n$752 million in 2024\nto cover loan losses, citing mortgage fraud as a key factor.\nThe conclusions landed amid significant upheaval at the housing finance agencies. In 2025, FHFA Director Bill Pulte named himself chairman of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and removed 14 board members. Fannie\u2019s CEO departed abruptly later that year, and several senior executives in its multifamily division have since exited, including a\nformer deputy general counsel\ninvolved in overseeing fraud investigations.\nPrior to the FHFA report, there had been few indications that multifamily mortgage fraud was easing. Apartment owners continued to struggle in 2025 as higher interest rates strained cash flows, and lenders including Walker &amp; Dunlop and Merchants Bank of Indiana publicly disclosed fraud-related problems in earnings reports.\n\u201cThe report makes it sound like multifamily fraud largely disappeared \u2014 and was mostly an early-2020s issue but I don\u2019t think it simply went away,\u201d said Joseph Kahn of VisionRE, a real estate advisory firm. \u201cMore likely, tighter agency scrutiny pushed much of it into CMBS, and we\u2019re seeing the consequences as those loans sour.\u201d\nOthers echoed the sentiment. Christopher Whalen, chairman of Whalen Global Advisors, which consults and analyzes financial institutions, said \u201cFraud is a continuing problem for both enterprises [Fannie and Freddie]. I suspect it will go up in 2025-26.\u201d\nWhalen said neither Fannie nor Freddie should be involved in the multifamily space.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have the people or resources to underwrite the credit. Same goes for HUD. As multifamily assets sink further in quality, this becomes the new subprime asset class.\u201d\nAfter the Covid-19 pandemic, Fannie, Freddie Mac and the FHFA discovered an increasing amount of\nmortgage fraud\nwhere borrowers either\ninflated rent rolls\nor flipped properties to related parties. The goal was to secure loans larger than they otherwise would have received. The investigations have led to Fannie and Freddie blacklisting dozens of industry players, including title agencies, brokers, borrowers and attorneys along with guilty pleas and criminal charges.\nThe FHFA\u2019s report also revealed the findings of one of Fannie\u2019s first fraud investigations. In November 2023, Fannie suspended doing new business with an unnamed mortgage brokerage. Fannie reviewed 126 high-risk loans at the brokerage. It hired outside counsel and accountants and found seven loans with \u201cconfirmed signs of fraud,\u201d according to the FHFA report.\nWhile the brokerage was not identified, Meridian Capital was blacklisted by the agencies around the same time. Meridian was removed from the agency\u2019s blacklist in 2025. Meridian did not return a request to comment.\nFrom there, the agency received more tips about multifamily fraud, most submitted internally. Fannie said the majority of the tips led to investigations which were closed with \u201cno fraud found.\u201d\nBut Fannie reported a huge uptick in tips and investigations in 2024. The influx caused the agency to report the increase in mortgage fraud referrals as an emerging risk to Fannie Mae\u2019s board of directors.\nFannie said, as of late, investigations into mortgage fraud started to decline.\nFraud was not listed as a major factor in its allowance for multifamily loan losses in Fannie\u2019s most recent report with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nFannie has made internal changes to prevent mortgage fraud. It said it increased requirements for appraisals and hired more staff to review appraisals and property conditions.\nThe agency has also taken further action against certain lenders where mortgage fraud was discovered.\nFannie required three lenders to repurchase five loans. Fannie has kicked eight lenders off its preferential delegation, which means they have to pass more hurdles to originate Fannie loans.\n\u201cFannie Mae takes mortgage fraud very seriously and we hold accountable those who enable or participate in fraud schemes and other criminal activities,\u201d said Fannie in a statement.\n",

Anyone working in New York City real estate knows the outline of the project\u2019s\ntwo decades of problems\n: how a development once described as a \u201cGarden of Eden\u201d got bogged down by opposition, financial problems and politics. By late 2022, the developer was in default on $350 million in loans tied to the megadevelopment, and a year later the lender moved to foreclose on the site.\nIt was hard to imagine who\u2019d want to jump in and finish the job. Anyone replacing the developer, Greenland USA, a subsidiary of Shanghai-based Greenland Holdings, would have to lay out a new vision, get state approval, negotiate hefty fines and set new deadlines.\nBut Cirrus\u2019 executives\nsaw\na salvage operation, and they\npurchased the debt\n.\n\u201cWe thought it was a no-brainer,\u201d McDonnell said during a recent interview in Cirrus\u2019 Midtown office.\nCirrus, which McDonnell runs with Anthony Tufariello, seemed a less obvious choice to others.\nAs a company, Cirrus hasn\u2019t built anything from the ground up and lacks the name recognition of Related Companies, another firm that toyed with taking over Pacific Park. Still, the pair has overseen $150 billion in real estate finance transactions, $10 billion in real estate equity investments and more than 10,000 multifamily units.\nNow, by relying on deep industry connections and experience from a long list of projects, McDonnell and Tufariello have positioned their firm as a backer of major projects that could deliver New York City thousands of affordable housing units after decades of delay, not just a quiet provider of rescue capital.\nAt Pacific Park, Cirrus brought on an experienced multifamily developer, LCOR, which oversees a portfolio of 10,000 residential units across the U.S. Then, the city tapped the two firms to build 3,000 housing units\nat a defunct airport in Flushing, Queens\n.\nAnother substantial project materialized in May 2025, when Cirrus formed a joint venture with Resorts World New York City to build up to 50,000 housing units across the five boroughs, a promise that sweetened the latter\u2019s bid to expand its slot parlor in Queens into a full-blown casino. In December, Resorts World\nclinched\none of three licenses awarded by the state.\nBut Cirrus\u2019 visibility wasn\u2019t quite as sudden as it seemed. The principals had gradually built a public profile. In March 2024, the company reached an agreement with Mayor Eric Adams and the Building and Construction Trades Council, signing a memorandum of understanding to raise money from the construction union pension funds to finance workforce housing throughout the city.\nInitially, $100 million was raised, but the fund is expected to cap out at $400 million, according to McDonnell.\nThe idea, which isn\u2019t unheard-of, is to invest in union-built, ground-up housing projects that are affordable to moderate-income residents. In other words, the workers whose pension funds are financing the construction can ultimately live in the buildings. All of Cirrus\u2019 proposed housing projects would be built this way.\nBut they are making their plans in a state with a raging debate about mandating union labor in housing production, especially affordable housing. Cirrus and the unions would like to prove that financing such projects with union pension funds is the solution, and one that can be scaled up to address the affordability crisis.\nThough Cirrus\u2019 proposed unit count is in the tens of thousands, success in these projects still doesn\u2019t guarantee that other developers, on other kinds of projects, would flock to the model.\n\u201cThis is proof of concept,\u201d Gary LaBarbera, head of the city and state chapters of the Building and Construction Trades Council, said.\nOf course, it\u2019s only proof if it\u2019s built.\nO\nrigin story\nBefore joining forces, McDonnell and Tufariello were rivals.\nAfter the 2008 financial crisis, the two competed for restructuring and rescue-capital deals \u2014 McDonnell at BlueMountain Capital and Tufariello at Fortress Investment Group.\nThe pair decided to leave their larger firms at about the same time, in 2017, and learned from industry scuttlebutt about each other\u2019s departure. They began working together informally and eventually registered as an investment advisor in January 2020. The timing was not ideal.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I would start a business just before Covid again,\u201d McDonnell said.\nWithout being able to travel and network, the pair leaned on investor relationships they\u2019d built over the course of their careers, even as other firms struggled to raise capital.\nTufariello, who has a home in Boca Raton, toured properties in Florida.\n\u201cHow fast can this approach be ramped up to meet the demand?\u201d\nLou Coletti, former president of the  Building Trades Employers\u2019 Association\nEarly deals included providing a $90 million inventory loan to the developers of the Zaha Hadid-designed One Thousand Museum condo tower in Miami. The team, led by Louis Birdman, Kevin Venger, Gregg Covin, Gilberto Bomeny and Todd Michael Glaser, were fending off foreclosure. An entity tied to Reuben Brothers had bought out Fortress\u2019 stake in the property in February 2021 and soon after filed a lawsuit to foreclose on the remaining 15 unsold condo units. The developers paid off the inventory loan that December.\nCirrus worked with the developers on two more deals, providing financing for development sites in Edgewater in Florida.\n\u201cWhenever we\u2019re taking down land, initially, they always have first look because they are just easy to deal with, very reasonable guys, who know the market well,\u201d Kevin Venger, co-founder of One Thousand Group, said.\nAt the beginning, McDonnell and Tufariello grew their credit business in New York, Miami, Los Angeles and San Francisco, with some work in Chicago and Washington, D.C. They recently created a joint venue to issue construction loans, though McDonnell wouldn\u2019t name the firm\u2019s partner on that.\nSince branching out to become developers, they have focused on New York, with plans to invest in Philadelphia, Boston and New Jersey. They say they\u2019ll announce a solo ground-up project in the coming months. Everything else is with partners.\nFor now, the firm works out of a temporary space on the sixth floor of Savanna\u2019s 106 West 56th Street; it bought a note secured by the office building in November 2023. On a January morning, employees filled cubicles in six-desk rows, though the space had the feeling of not being fully set up, with computer monitors propped up against empty bright white walls.\nThe principals named the company after cirrus clouds, the wisps that form at very high altitudes. McDonnell evoked the lofty feeling, leaning on the word \u201celevate\u201d when discussing the firm\u2019s interactions with investors, partners and residents.\nHe also takes the name literally.\n\u201cWhen you look at where Cirrus invests generally, it tends to be really only the top four or five markets in the U.S., where buildings tend to be taller,\u201d McDonnell said.\nT\nhe union connect\nThe deal to build with union labor and pension funds came together with the help of Kevin Gallagher, who\u2019d known LaBarbera for 20 years and introduced him to McDonnell and Tufariello.\nGallagher, a veteran of both the union and workforce housing scenes, then joined Cirrus in 2024 as head of origination and structuring for Cirrus\u2019 workforce housing fund.\nIn 2006, as director of housing for the New York City Central Labor Council of the AFL-CIO, he helped lead the union\u2019s charge to raise $4 billion to bid on Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, an effort that failed when Tishman Speyer agreed to pay $5.4 billion for the complex.\nHe later made a similar play for Starrett City with former associates, with whom he is locked in a bitter legal fight.\nIn 2015, he sued John Crotty, John Warren and John Fitzgerald, accusing them of closing him out of a lucrative partnership between their company, Workforce Housing Advisors, and JPMorgan. The trio, which now runs a separate company called Workforce Housing Group, argue that they worked with Gallagher through limited partnerships tied to individual projects, not as a formal company. According to their responses to the lawsuit, the agreement didn\u2019t prevent them from pursuing opportunities without Gallagher, whom their attorney describes in court filings as \u201cgreedy.\u201d\n\u201cKevin has demonstrated a total disregard for affordable housing in his actions with us,\u201d Crotty said in an interview. \u201cHim presenting himself as an affordable-housing person to the people of Brooklyn is laugh-out-loud funny.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Cirrus declined to comment on the litigation but said Kevin was proud of his work on Stuyvesant Town and Starrett City, which he believed brought more attention to affordable housing: \u201cHe is overjoyed that today\u2019s political landscape has finally caught up with those priorities.\u201d\nLitigation aside, Gallagher\u2019s model at Cirrus has some elements of his earlier workforce housing ventures. Then, he targeted overleveraged multifamily buildings, bought up the notes on underperforming loans and, in cases where the owner couldn\u2019t pay up, foreclosed and submitted a credit bid to take control of the property. Partners would then secure permanent financing, with the goal of \u201cmoving properties out of the cycle of bad investment into responsible, long-term ownership,\u201d according to an investor deck for one of the previous company\u2019s funds, which was filed with court documents.\nThough Cirrus still buys overleveraged loans and takes over properties, McDonnell said he doesn\u2019t consider Cirrus to be in the business of \u201cdistressed debt,\u201d and that the company prefers to work out solutions for borrowers. This has resulted in repeat customers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re brought into these situations, usually when it\u2019s very strong real estate, but it\u2019s a complex situation,\u201d he said.\nW\norkforce housing for NYC\nNew York City has many housing initiatives but few for the \u201cmissing middle,\u201d Cirrus\u2019 audience.\nCirrus\u2019 plan to finance and build these units made sense to LaBarbera, who met with the Cirrus executives.\nAbout the same time, LaBarbera was talking with Mayor Adams, he recalled. \u201cWe got to a point where [Adams] loved the concept. I said to him, \u2018Look, give us a year.\u2019\u201d\nThey got individual union pension funds on board and raised the initial $100 million. The mayor traveled to the buildings trades\u2019 conference in Florida to sign the MOU. Since then, they have pooled pension funds from more than a dozen construction unions.\nThe fund will take equity positions in Pacific Park, as well as\nat the Flushing airport site\n. Some have questioned whether the deal with the city gave Cirrus an edge in the competition for the latter site. Cirrus and LCOR were one of seven teams that bid on the project, according to a response provided to The Real Deal following a freedom of information request. Cirrus\u2019 proposal called for more housing units than most of the other proposals. One team pitched constructing a cement alternative factory on the site.\nStill, Andrew Esposito of Apex Development, one of the bidders, said that \u201cgiven the challenges presented at the site, \u2026 we query how the selected group with a glaringly absent track record of completing development projects will address these real issues, while also incorporating promises of extensive union involvement.\u201d\nUnions have struggled to increase their market share of affordable housing projects in New York City, and attempts to legislate such growth have been met with resistance from developers. For example, the property break 485x sets a construction wage floor for all projects with 100 or more units, and even higher for projects above 150. Developers have avoided these mandates by capping units at 99.\nIt remains to be seen what level of public subsidy these projects will require, even with the union pension fund investments. Cirrus is seeking the property tax break 485x at the airport site, and McDonnell has said that the final housing plan for Pacific Park will rely on what city and state subsidies are available.\nLaBarbera, however, believes that the city signing on to the model indicates that projects will pencil out.\n\u201cThere was always this position of the real estate industry that this couldn\u2019t be done, that you can\u2019t build residential, affordable, workforce housing under a union model,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have just disproved that.\u201d\nB\nehind the scenes\u00a0at Pacific Park\nGreenland USA\u2019s lender on the Pacific Park sites was Nick Mastroianni\u2019s U.S. Immigration Fund, which had raised capital through the cash-for-visas EB-5 program.\nCirrus then took over $200 million in Greenland\u2019s outstanding debt across the U.S., and was in a position to also take on the more than\n$350 million\nattached to six sites at Pacific Park, which USIF had provided; Fortress also owned a stake in the debt.\n\u201cThat was a very difficult and challenging deal to do,\u201d Mastroianni said. \u201cI\u2019d been negotiating with Greenland for five years, I couldn\u2019t get them to move.\u201d\nIn early 2025, Mastroianni and McDonnell got lunch at Cipriani\u2019s on Fifth Avenue.\nThey disagree on who asked whom but align on the subject of the meeting: what to do about Pacific Park.\n\u201cI said, listen you\u2019re willing,\nlet\u2019s put it together\n,\u201d Mastroianni recalled.\nThe two had previously worked together at The Bryant, HFZ Capital Group\u2019s luxury condo hotel on West 40th Street, which Cirrus recapitalized, providing a loan to USIF, after HFZ collapsed.\nCirrus\u2019 principals had previous run-ins with the defunct real estate firm. Through the Versant Group, Tufariello invested in commercial lender Allegiant Capital in 2017, alongside HFZ executives Ziel Feldman and Nir Meir. An October filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission lists Tufariello as a chair of the company, as well as an indirect owner alongside Feldman and Meir. Both Feldman and Meir have previously claimed to own significant stakes in Versant, according to court filings.\nRepresentatives for Cirrus said the filing was an error and that Tufariello hasn\u2019t been involved with Allegiant since 2019. They indicated that Tufariello didn\u2019t have a relationship with HFZ.\nMastroianni credits Cirrus\u2019 purchase of most of Greenland\u2019s debt for moving the megadevelopment forward. Related Companies was in talks for the project in 2024, but ultimately decided against sticking around.\nCirrus\u2019 ability to absorb the rail yard sites, as well as a separate property across from the Barclays Center, likely played in its favor. At the very least, the fact that the company could incorporate the site into its broader plans strengthened its pitch to state officials, who needed to approve the development team replacing Greenland.\nCirrus and LCOR officially took over the train sites in October, through a foreclosure auction and with the blessing of Empire State Development and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.\nAnthony Tortora, co-chief investment officer at LCOR, said he was introduced to the Cirrus leaders through a mutual friend at Plaza Construction. The skill sets of the two companies complemented each other, he said. Cirrus brought extensive capital markets experience and a good relationship with the unions to the table, while LCOR had a history in multifamily development, as well as its work at another rail yard in Hoboken, New Jersey.\nThe companies also shared a commitment to building workforce housing.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of alignment in terms of how we think about the world,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere was always this position of the real estate industry that this couldn\u2019t be done, that you can\u2019t build residential,  affordable, workforce housing under a union model. We have just disproved that.\u201d\nGary LaBarbera on hopes for Cirrus\u2019 union-pension-funded development model\nPacific Park, originally called Atlantic Yards, was first announced in 2003, and has since been held up by various forces, including litigation, construction defects, the departure of developers and in the case of Greenland, the financial woes of its parent company in China.\nOver the past two decades, nine buildings (including the Barclays Center) have been completed, with more than 3,200 apartments built by Forest City Ratner, Greenland USA and other developers who, over the years, have taken over individual sites.\nCirrus and LCOR have pitched what they\u2019ve called \u201ccontours of a plan\u201d for the remaining sites. This vision would result in taller towers than previously planned and would ultimately net 9,000 units instead of 6,430.\nMcDonnell is the most public-facing of the Cirrus executives. Soft-spoken and measured at public meetings, he has described the vision he and his partners have devised so far as what is \u201cfeasible\u201d but not final.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to bring a very realistic and transparent approach to this,\u201d he said.\nHe also has emphasized the \u201cmission-driven\u201d nature of the workforce housing fund, and that Cirrus\u2019 plan is guided by wanting to build as much housing as quickly as possible, and to make it affordable to a range of incomes. For that reason, Cirrus and LCOR are considering not building on one of the six rail yard sites and instead shifting density there to the other planned towers.\nThe affordable units would target moderate to middle-income residents, capping rent at levels affordable to those earning 130 percent of the area median income.\nThat threshold has already drawn criticism from advocates who have long followed the project, arguing that more units need to be accessible to very low-income earners.\nF\nuture looking\nA number of the company\u2019s projects are in transition. In December, Cirrus won a bankruptcy auction for a Miami redevelopment site with a $77 million credit bid. The company had moved to foreclose after the developer Gilberto Bomeny defaulted on a $70 million loan tied to the property. A judge, however, ordered a new auction, in which Cirrus ultimately won with a $95 million bid. Cirrus\u2019 plans for the site are unclear.\nA judge, however, ordered a new auction, finding that \u201cconstant changes and irregularities\u201d prevented other bidders from competing. Cirrus\u2019 plans for the site, should they ultimately hold onto it, are unclear.\nIn New York, the board charged with reviewing applications for state casino licenses urged gaming officials to closely track all commitments made by the three winning teams \u2014 including the housing pledge made by Resorts World, which it described as vague. McDonnell said no sites have been selected yet as part of its partnership with Resorts World.\nAt Pacific Park, Cirrus and LCOR must ink a memorandum of understanding outlining the project by July 31, 2026. Otherwise, the state could renew fines against the firm that were supposed to kick in in June 2025, a previous deadline for completing the project\u2019s affordable housing units that Greenland failed to meet.\nIt\u2019s been nearly two years since the agreement was reached with the city and the construction unions, and Cirrus also must work with a new administration. Mayor Zohran Mamdani has said that he wants to build 200,000 affordable housing units in the next decade, exclusively with union labor. He hasn\u2019t specified how he is going to do that nor if he\u2019s planning to lean on the model employed by Cirrus. (Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, by contrast, cited Cirrus by name in his housing plan.)\nMcDonnell sees a potential champion in Leila Bozorg, deputy mayor of housing and planning, who formerly served in the Adams administration and was involved in the agreement with the union pension funds.\nIn an interview, she said she is committed to work with the building trades to develop more workforce housing models and is working with the city and state comptrollers to explore other pension fund investments into housing.\nLou Coletti, a senior advisor with government relations firm Davidoff, Hutcher &amp; Citron and former president of the Building Trades Employers\u2019 Association, which represents general contractors, said the model could be difficult to replicate on a grand scale, given that the individual board of trustees for each pension fund has to sign off on investing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite a lengthy process,\u201d he said. \u201cHow fast can this approach be ramped up to meet the demand?\u201d",

        "content": "Protesters waving signs reading \u201cFreeze the Rent\u201d and \u201cREBNY Raised My Rent\u201d stationed themselves on the sidewalk outside the Glasshouse, a Hell\u2019s Kitchen venue where the Real Estate Board of New York was hosting its annual gala last year.\nAmong the tenants and activists gathered outside the event, nicknamed the \u201cLiar\u2019s Ball,\u201d was Zohran Mamdani, then a New York assemblymember and mayoral hopeful. He\u2019d just announced his candidacy three months prior, and though his winning was seen by most as a longshot, Mamdani\u2019s campaign fundraising efforts had already started to outpace some of his opponents.\nOne of the pillars of his platform was a vow to halt rent hikes for tenants of rent-stabilized properties \u2014 a pledge he repeated loudly and proudly that didn\u2019t win him any favors with the city\u2019s real estate players, many of whom were looking down on the protests from six floors above.\nFast forward a year,\nand Mamdani is now the 112th mayor of New York City, much to the chagrin of many in the industry, who shelled out millions in an effort to thwart his victory and keep his Democratic socialist ideologies out of Gracie Mansion. After four years of a relative reprieve under Mayor Eric Adams, it seemed real estate would be back as the city government\u2019s ghouls.\n\u201cLet\u2019s not demonize real estate,\u201d David Schechtman of Meridian Investment Sales said at the 2026 edition of the REBNY gala, at the Waldorf Astoria. \u201cFor many years, we\u2019ve held up this city.\u201d\nDespite its opposition to Mamdani, after the general election, it seemed the mayor \u2014 who had already admitted he\u2019d changed his mind about the role of private developers in solving the city\u2019s housing crisis \u2014 was prepared to at least listen to industry stakeholders.\nShortly after his win, Mamdani held closed-door meetings with developers, lenders and investors including Tishman Speyer CEO Rob Speyer, Two Trees CEO and REBNY chair Jed Walentas and Nadeem Meghji, global co-head of real estate at Blackstone, among others, where he assured them that his administration would be open to hearing their concerns.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for the politicians to embrace the real estate industry. We pay the bills.\u201d\nJames Wacht, Lee &amp; Associates\nThen he made a series of appointments that appeared relatively promising. He tapped Leila Bozorg as the deputy mayor of housing and planning. Bozorg previously served as Adams\u2019 executive director of housing and has been credited as a key figure in passing the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity legislation, which many in the industry heralded as a significant step toward increasing development.\nHe also added Ahmed Tigani, another Adams alumnus, to his administration as the Commissioner of the Department of Buildings.\nBut his first\nfew official actions\ndidn\u2019t signal cooperation, though he continues to hammer the idea that the private sector should play a role in new development. He tapped a longtime foe of landlords to oversee a tenant protection agency, then announced the city would host a series of hearings that set the stage for public landlord shaming sessions.\n\u201cIt absolutely smelled, looked and felt like a very meaningful signal shift,\u201d said Peter Hungerford, CEO of PH Realty Capital, which, along with its partners, has been one of the most active buyers of rent-stabilized buildings in recent years. He described several of Mamdani\u2019s first moves as \u201cmore confrontational and aggressive to owners.\u201d\nNow many in the industry are once again preparing to be cast as henchmen contributing to all of the city\u2019s ills.\n\u201cWithin just a few hours of the inauguration, [Mamdani] immediately maintained the position that current property owners are the bogeyman,\u201d Kenny Burgos, CEO of the New York Apartment Association, said. \u201cIt cannot be true that every single operator is suddenly a slumlord.\u201d\nHal Fetner, CEO of Fetner Properties, expressed uncertainty about the new mayoral administration, pointing to Mamdani\u2019s focus on relying on city government to improve housing affordability, rather than through partnership with the private sector.\n\u201cPolitics in the city right now, I would say, it\u2019s scary,\u201d Fetner said at the gala. \u201cIt\u2019s not about freezing the rents.\u201d\nO\nut of the gates\nOnce sworn into office, Mamdani hit the ground running.\nOn his first day as mayor, Mamdani signed an executive order reviving the city\u2019s dormant Office to Protect Tenants and appointing renter activist Cea Weaver as its director.\nThe choice to tap Weaver, viewed as an adversary by many in the landlord contingent, was a concerning one for many of the city\u2019s multifamily players. Weaver, previously the director of New York State Tenant Bloc and Housing Justice for All, played a central role in passing the 2019 rent laws, which owners of rent-stabilized properties credit for the distress plaguing their portfolios.\nThe scrutiny intensified days later when a few of her old tweets resurfaced in news articles, including one calling homeownership \u201ca weapon of white supremacy.\u201d (Weaver later backtracked on the sentiments expressed in her previous posts in an interview with NY1\u2019s Errol Louis, describing the language in the tweets as \u201cinelegant\u201d and \u201cregretful.\u201d )\nWeaver \u201cseems pretty committed to destroying property rights,\u201d Hungerford said.\nHungerford also criticized her previous comments advocating for more city-owned housing through the New York City Housing Authority, or NYCHA, which he called the \u201cabsolute poster child for New York City\u2019s worst landlord.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental disconnect between this administration right now and reality, and if that\u2019s who Mamdani is going to appoint and that\u2019s their belief, it\u2019s so far from realistic,\u201d Hungerford said.\nTwo days later, Mamdani and Weaver announced the city\u2019s intention to\nintervene\nin the legal battle over 5,000 rent-stabilized apartments owned by one of the city\u2019s largest landlords, Joel Weiner\u2019s Pinnacle Group \u2014 a portfolio which was then set to be auctioned off on Jan. 8. The administration attempted to pause the sale to the proposed buyer, Summit Properties, over concerns that the firm wouldn\u2019t be able to make the necessary repairs \u2014 a bid a bankruptcy judge ultimately rejected. Summit, which had agreed to pay roughly $450 million for the portfolio, was confirmed as the buyer a week later.\nThen came the \u201c\nRental Ripoff\n\u201d hearings announcement. On his first Monday at the helm of the city, Mamdani signed another executive order instituting the hearings aimed at allowing tenants to air their grievances with landlords in front of a group of city agencies including Weaver\u2019s. The order mandated that hearings in every borough be underway within Mamdani\u2019s first 100 days in office, with the goal of producing a report based on the content.\nThough the order mentioned landlords and property managers as potential speakers, as The Real Deal\u2019s Erik Engquist pointed out in a column, \u201cthat is kind of like inviting sheep to a gathering of wolves.\u201d The administration intends the hearings to be a place for renters and activists to share stories of \u201cillegal, unfair, abusive, deceptive, or unconscionable landlord practices\u201d \u2014 likely setting the stage for future policy decisions, such as freezing the rents for rent-stabilized properties, a goal Mamdani has been vocal about achieving (though, the authority to do so rests with the Rent Guidelines Board).\n\u201cA lot of this comes off as very theatrical and not policy-based,\u201d Burgos said. \u201cIt\u2019s simply a public display to build up support for his goal of a rent freeze come June. He knows the numbers won\u2019t support a rent freeze, so he needs to create the story arc.\u201d\nWhen Mamdani was a no-show at\nREBNY\u2019s January gala\n, real estate players took note.\n\u201cThe fact that our mayor is not going to be here tonight, I think, is wrong,\u201d James Wacht, founding partner and managing principal of Lee &amp; Associates, said at the gala. \u201dIt\u2019s important for the politicians to embrace the real estate industry. We pay the bills.\u201d\nThe Soloviev Group\u2019s Michael Hershman told\nTRD\nthe mayor\u2019s absence was a \u201cmissed opportunity.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the best interests of the real estate community and the mayor to be able to sit down and talk about what\u2019s best for the city, what\u2019s best for the people of the city,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we do that with kind of an open mind, I think we can find common ground.\u201d\nAlso at the gala, David Falk, president of Newmark\u2019s tri-state region, expressed concern about a breakdown in communication between the city and real estate.\n\u201cWe are not adversaries,\u201d he said. \u201cForget what was going on during the running for office and the different candidates, the real estate industry just wants someone that can be their advocate.\u201d\nF\nriends, enemies\u00a0or frenemies?\nWhat do you call a builder who hasn\u2019t started collecting rent? A developer. And for now, it appears that distinction still provides them with cover from Mamdani.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very optimistic about this administration\u2019s real focus on affordable housing. I think it\u2019s the clearest focus on affordable housing we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said David Schwartz, co-founder of Slate Property Group, nodding to the appointments of Bozorg and Tigani as positive signs.\nWhile landlords are once again back in the hot seat, the mayor appears much more willing to engage with the city\u2019s developers. He\u2019s acknowledged multiple times that the city is in desperate need of more housing, and has even relaxed his previous views that the only way to build more housing is by working with nonprofit developers to construct city-owned properties.\n\u201cAt first we were worried, but I give him a lot of credit,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cI don\u2019t think a lot of politicians do that and change their opinion, even when they realize they may have said something wrong. I think some of them double down.\u201d\nMamdani\u2019s tentative friendliness is different from previous administrations, such as Mayor Bill De Blasio\u2019s, which equated development with gentrification and often vilified developers.\n\u201cIf we look at the story arc of Mayor Mamdani\u2019s primary campaign until today, there certainly has been a moderation, specifically in terms of the development of housing and the role of private industry,\u201d Burgos said.\nBozorg and Tigani did show up to the gala, signaling that hope is not lost in terms of the industry having a seat at the table.\n\u201cI\u2019m the optimistic one in the room,\u201d said developer Spencer Levine, president of RAL Companies. \u201cSince the inauguration, there definitely has been a different projection of the conversation and attitude, but that might just be him feeling his ground. It\u2019s way too early to see.\u201d\nHowever, others say an understanding between the city and the industry won\u2019t happen if the mayor doesn\u2019t tone down his rhetoric.\n\u201cHe needs to pivot and stop campaigning and start governing,\u201d Peter Rigardi, chairman and president of JLL\u2019s tri-state region, said at the REBNY gala.\n\u201cHis mission for affordable housing is a noble and needed one, but it\u2019s not going to happen with just energetic, young ideas,\u201d he added. \u201cHe needs to marry that with experience and the right capital that makes these types of projects happen.\u201d\nKathy Wylde, the former head of the Partnership for New York City who helped organize initial meetings between the mayor and industry leaders, said the administration is still getting up and running, and that the first few actions were likely easy fixes that would signal to his base that he\u2019s staying true to his word.\nHowever, she emphasized that the administration is by no means closed off to the idea of continued meetings with real estate stakeholders, and reported that members of the administration have said that they will likely open their schedules around March, after they finish hiring and the city budget proposal.\n\u201cThis administration really had to campaign until the polls closed on Nov. 5, so to be fair, they did not have the usual window in regard to key appointments,\u201d Wylde said. \u201cMy message is just give it a little time.\u201d\n\u2014 Lilah Burke contributed reporting",

        "content": "Tenants, activists and press crowded the halls of Lower Manhattan bankruptcy court, eager to see the new landlord, Zohar Levy.\nLevy\u2019s Summit placed a $451 million stalking-horse bid for a 93-building, approximately 5,200-unit portfolio put into bankruptcy by Pinnacle Group. Now, the little-known investor, taking a break from a family vacation in Europe to answer questions from the city and tenants\u2019 attorneys by video call, was about to become a New York City rent-stabilized landlord.\nDid he know what would come next?\n\u201cWe are aware of the responsibility attached to managing such a portfolio,\u201d Levy said at his testimony in January.\nBankruptcy court, usually procedural, had turned into a testing ground for how the city would fulfill its promises to tenants, as New York City\u2019s\nnew mayor Zohran Mamdani\nobjected\nto Summit\u2019s bid at the last minute and sought a delay in the bankruptcy. The city questioned whether\nthe deal was financially viable\n, noting that nearly all of the units were rent-stabilized with below-market rents. In filings, attorneys asked how the property\u2019s income could cover its debt costs.\nThose in the industry had similar questions. Investor interest in rent-stabilized portfolios plunged after the passage of Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, which made it impossible for landlords to substantially raise rents, even following a vacancy. The Federal Reserve\u2019s rate hikes starting in 2022 only made things worse. The asset class was deemed uninvestable, and the doomsday scenario spun out: Owners would no longer pay for basic maintenance, properties would fall into the hands of vulture investors, the city\u2019s housing stock would further erode and banks would be left on the hook with millions in bad loans.\n\u201cEverything can be done with less money.\u201d\nZohar Levy, in a 2005 interview in the Israeli press [translated from Hebrew]\nEven typically level-headed advisors and think-tank fellows began to sound the alarm.\n\u201cUnless we vastly increase the amount of budget for subsidized housing, almost all of it is going to have to go to rescuing these buildings,\u201d Mark Willis of NYU\u2019s Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy said in a presentation last April. He suggested that an intervention might be needed to save the buildings.\nYet Zohar Levy is neither a government intervention, an out-of-town speculator nor an optimist expecting the state\u2019s rent law to change. Now in his late 50s, Levy made a fortune investing in Germany\u2019s real estate market, and amid all the noise, he believes the numbers simply pencil out.\n\u201cThe fundamentals of the portfolio provide a steady, albeit conservative, return on the investment,\u201d a Summit spokesperson said.\nIf he\u2019s right, the\ndeal\nthrows water on the fiery arguments of both tenant and landlord advocates.\nT\nhe buyer\nLevy was born in Haifa, Israel, and studied accounting at school. He became the CFO of Engel Resources, a real estate firm run by his father-in-law, billionaire Jacob Engel, who made one of his many fortunes building housing for post-Soviet immigrants to Israel in the early 1990s.\nLevy went out on his own in about 2002. In his first deal, he bought a struggling real estate company in Israel, known as Chayel Holdings. He saw an opportunity to cut costs, restructure its debt and find profitability.\n\u201cIt all started with an ad I saw in the newspaper for the sale of Chayel Holdings,\u201d Levy said in an interview with the Israeli business publication Globes in 2005.\nLevy slashed management costs at Chayel from 12 million shekels to 1.5 million shekels a year, telling Globes that income-producing real estate companies did not need so many expenses such as managers, cell phones or engineers on hand.\n\u201cI discovered that everything can be done with less money,\u201d he said in Hebrew in the Globes interview. Collectively, press about Levy describes him as a private person with an analytical mind.\nHe rebanded the firm as Summit and raised money by issuing bonds in Israel\u2019s capital markets.\nIn 2004, Levy saw Germany as the next frontier for undervalued assets. At the time, Germany\u2019s economic growth was stagnant. It was not a popular destination for international investors. But Levy started acquiring grocery-anchored retail centers and other commercial and residential properties.\nStarting in 2007, Summit\u2019s German business grew rapidly. The company raised 300 million euros on the London Stock Exchange. It acquired Deutsche Real Estate AG, a publicly traded company on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.\nLevy decided to move out of the German market in the early 2020s. He unloaded most of Summit\u2019s German portfolio, grossing over 1 billion euros and reinvested the money into U.S. real estate. Summit created a U.S. subsidiary, which acquired stakes in 90 residential buildings with 3,100 units, two unspecified hotels in New York City and 27 retail centers and malls across the country.\nLevy\u2019s work was not limited to real estate. Summit took a 16 percent stake in Paz, an Israeli energy and retail company, which he sold in July 2025 for 1.1 billion Israeli shekels, or $350 million. It was one of the largest deals in Tel Aviv Stock Exchange history, according to Globes.\nSummit\u2019s deals also include value-add opportunities with higher risk. In October 2025, Summit acquired the leasehold on 444 Madison Avenue, a 42-story Class B office tower for just $42 million. The previous owner, Westbrook, bought the lease on the 1930s-era office building for $314 million in 2007.\nBut Levy was still not a known player in New York City real estate. His acquisitions of rental buildings were made through a limited partnership. When The Real Deal reached out to sources about Levy, few had heard of him.\nThen came the Pinnacle auction.\nT\nhe portfolio\nIn 1997, Pinnacle Group owned 267 apartments in New York City, the New York Times reported. Joel Wiener slowly grew the business to over 20,000 units, largely rent-stabilized, across Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan and the Bronx. He also converted over a dozen of the rent-stabilized apartment buildings into condominiums.\nOver the years, tenant groups accused Wiener and his company Pinnacle of shoddy repairs and rent overcharges, especially as demand ratcheted up for the gentrifying neighborhoods where he owned.\nWiener was among the first U.S. developers to sell bonds in Israel, providing him with over $500 million in cheap financing. By 2017, his portfolio was valued at $2 billion and Wiener himself was a billionaire, according to Bloomberg.\nThings started to go south for Pinnacle in 2019, after the state law limited stabilized landlords from raising rents after making improvements. It also made it more difficult for landlords to convert rent-stabilized buildings into condos.\nIn May 2025, Pinnacle\u2019s lender, Flagstar Bank, initiated a foreclosure on a $564 million loan tied to the 5,200-unit portfolio. To stop the foreclosure, Pinnacle put those properties into bankruptcy protection, valuing the portfolio at $826 million.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t view it as a heavy lift.\u201d\nPeter Hungerford, who bid on the Pinnacle portfolio\nA month later, Levy met with Wiener and his associates, according to Globes. (Wiener has an Israeli subsidiary called Zarasai Group.)\nSummit was also seeking to make a deal with Pinnacle\u2019s Israeli bondholders, Globes reported. The bonds, which were trading for junk status, would be converted to shares of a new real estate company controlled by Summit.\nA Summit spokesperson said the deal never materialized.\nInstead, Summit decided to enter the contentious bankruptcy process for a much bigger slice of Pinnacle\u2019s portfolio. Eastdil Secured ran the marketing process attracting 14 offers on the first round of bidding and seven qualified offers in the second round. Summit was the stalking horse bidder.\nPH Realty\u2019s Peter Hungerford, whose firm\nhas acquired\n4,100 apartment units, including recent purchases of stabilized stock, said he made a bid on the Pinnacle portfolio. After tours, he found the conditions to be \u201cgood overall.\u201d\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t view it as a heavy lift,\u201d he said.\nBut Summit was the winning bidder after a multi-round process, offering $451.3 million or $87,000 per unit.\nFlagstar slashed its debt and offered Summit a $338.5 million loan for the acquisition at an attractive rate of 5.25 percent. (Summit\u2019s spokesperson said the terms of the loan were part of a negotiation. Flagstar did not return a request to comment.)\nT\nhe plan\nSummit had penciled the deal as a run-of-the-mill apartment deal, with lower debt costs that will allow the firm to increase cash flow, according to Summit. The firm expects to bring in $36 million in net operating income annually which amounts to a capitalization rate of about 8 percent. (The cap rate, a metric showing the property\u2019s potential return, for New York City walk-up apartment transactions during the fourth quarter of 2025, averaged 7.46 percent, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield.)\nBut the city\u2019s legal team appeared unwilling to accept Summit\u2019s numbers. During the bankruptcy process, lawyers raised questions about Summit\u2019s financial ability to cure violations, history as a property owner and limited experience running real estate in New York.\nSummit responded, noting that only 420 units, or 8 percent of the portfolio, account for all of the violations. It said it would spend $10 million in the first year fixing violations and addressing maintenance needs with $3 million specifically on existing violations. In five years, it would spend a total of $30 million in capital improvements.\nThe city\u2019s close involvement wasn\u2019t a deterrent.\n\u201cThis is a high profile deal with a lot of public attention. It is not surprising that the City took such an active role,\u201d a Summit spokesperson said. \u201cWe understand the City\u2019s concern and look forward to working with them to improve the buildings.\u201d\nOn Jan. 16, David Jones, the bankruptcy court judge,\napproved the sale\n.\n\u201cSummit\u2019s statements make clear its commitment to do what is needed,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe city\u2019s approach to this case gives me confidence that the city will monitor and police Summit\u2019s performance.\u201d\nIf Summit\u2019s assessment is to be believed, about 92 percent of the portfolio is in good shape. Summit is budgeting only $30 million, or $97 per unit per month, to repairs. In the big picture, that\u2019s not very much. Because Mamdani has vowed to \u201cfreeze the rent\u201d by appointing new representatives to the nine-member Rent Guidelines Board, the landlord won\u2019t get annual increases on the units if it has underestimated the work.\nWith no expectation of vacancy decontrol or substantial rent increases, the numbers may be tougher to hit \u2014 the landlord advocates and the city now both admit the expenses are high and the income too low.\nBut if Levy, the accountant, has it right, he may get back to an older way of running rent-stabilization buildings, where owners held property for long periods of time, expecting steady cash flow rather than large returns on future sales.",

        "content": "Some of the usual suspects of the Southern California commercial real estate crowd chatted over breakfast burritos and coffee at a Hilton hotel in Little Tokyo on Wednesday, perhaps\u00a0 in hopes of getting some deals done in what panelists would later describe as another hard year.\nThree chief executives of family-owned businesses, among others, sat on the panel at Bisnow\u2019s first Los Angeles event of the year: Nadine Watt of Watt Capital Partners, Mike Lowe of Lowe Enterprise, and Christopher Rising of Rising Realty Partners.\nAll three said this year won\u2019t be easy, with no white knight to save the day, or downtown. Institutional capital, even if it hasn\u2019t written off Los Angeles, is in wait-and-see mode, Lowe said.\nRising was a hit for his mix of humor and straight talk.\n\u201cAt our height we were the second largest landlord behind Brookfield in downtown L.A., and we\u2019re still around \u2014 they\u2019re not,\u201d Rising said, alluding to his efforts to hold on to One California Plaza as opposed to the hundreds of millions of dollars worth of downtown office towers Brookfield has defaulted upon in an exit being made mostly via lenders or receivers.Brookfield has multiple\nofferings\nthroughout downtown\u2019s Financial District that account for about a fifth of Class A office space.\nThat elicited some laughs, but Rising then commanded attention with a serious assessment of current events. The son of the late Nelson Rising, who was very involved in California politics, said \u201cthere is a broken trust with Wall Street,\u201d and it stems from Measure ULA. That\u2019s the City of Los Angeles\u2019 property-transfer tax that\u2019s also known as the mansion tax despite the fact that it hits the commercial as well as residential sectors with a 4 percent levy on deals of more than $5 million, and 5.5 percent on deals priced at more than $10 million.\nWall Street believes elected officials specifically went after corporate profit, Rising said, with Measure ULA, which drew rumbings of\nreform\nthis week before being\nkicked\nto committee by the city council.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to rebuild trust,\u201d Rising said. \u201cI would like to see our mayor and our city council get on an airplane and go down where all the private equity firms are and say, \u2018we\u2019re open for business\u2019 \u2026 I don\u2019t think that will happen \u2026 I\u2019d be happy to \u2026 make introductions.\u201d\nBack to back to work\nRising, who co-owns One California Plaza, the office tower on Bunker Hill that\u2019s now in the hands of a\nreceiver\nafter a $300 million default, wants workers back at their desks, particularly government employees downtown. He shared a conversation he said he had with Mayor Karen Bass a couple years ago, where he asked her what it would take to get people back in the office. Her response, he said, was that her staff comes in but she can\u2019t force other city personnel to do so.\nRising called the mayor\u2019s response \u201cinappropriate,\u201d and that he told her she could change department heads, but she wouldn\u2019t.\nHis goal wasn\u2019t to attack her but something\u2019s gotta give. \u201cOur elected officials are so hostile to the business environment,\u201d he said.\nNew money meets old\nDavid and Daniel Mirharooni purchased a pair of adjacent properties in Beverly Hills\u2019 Golden Triangle for about $25 million, or around $1,500 per square foot, from Anderson Real Estate, founded by late billionaire and Los Angeles businessman John Anderson, whose name adorns the business school at the UCLA. Newmark\u2019s Jay Luchs and Gavin Ketchum brokered the off-market transaction.\nThe deal was for 202 North Canon Drive, a one-story home to Rodeo Realty, and 208 North Canon Drive, which can be used for office or retail \u2014 the two buildings amount to about 16,400 square feet.\nIt\u2019s a pricey\ntrade\n, and a notable one. The Mirharoonis have made other Beverly Hills buys, where commercial deals are untouched by the mansion tax. They own a Mastro\u2019s on Canon, and recently purchased retail on South Robertson Boulevard for almost $8 million, or $985 per square foot. But why did Anderson sell? It still owns 9720 Wilshire, a stunning office tower in Beverly Hills\u2019 Golden Triangle.\nKnockout\nOlympic gold medalist and 10-time world champion boxer Oscar De La Hoya\ndefaulted\non a $27 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan connected to an office building at 626 Wilshire Boulevard in the Financial District of downtown LA.\u00a0 The \u201cGolden Boy\u201d looks tarnished on this deal, with about $23 million in date and foreclosure looming.\nEyesore no more?\nCreditors reached a bankruptcy-exit agreement over Oceanwide Plaza downtown,\naccording to\nBloomberg. That clears the way for a possible sale of the undone towers covered in graffiti. A potential investor is in talks to buy the property, but the deal hinges on resolving the bankruptcy, Bloomberg reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.\n",

        "content": "For 13 years in a row, South Shore\u2019s multifamily market had an argument for being crowned the hottest in Chicago.\nFrom 2011 through 2023, the predominantly Black lakefront community just south of Jackson Park, where the new Obama Presidential Center is opening this summer, notched the most sales of any Chicago neighborhood for buildings with five units or more, according to the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University.\nIn some years during that stretch, South Shore, where working-class families have traditionally settled and moved up the economic rungs, saw more than twice as many such sales as runner-up neighborhoods. The area had more than 100 sales in two separate years, 2018 and 2022. No other Chicago community area tallied more than 80 sales in a single year during the entire 13-year period.\nBut in 2024, the activity fell off. South Shore \u2014 which is much more densely filled with larger buildings than most other South Side neighborhoods \u2014 came in fourth in Chicago, with only 34 sales of buildings with at least five units, the fewest since 2010.\nOf course, interest rate hikes in recent years slowed deal velocity, but that impacted everywhere. Landlords in South Shore have historically been more prone to financial trouble. According to DePaul data, the area notched the most foreclosure filings out of all city neighborhoods for buildings with at least five units most years since 2010.\nBehind the slower deal flow is a wave of distress now cresting in South Shore and placing it in riskier territory than other Chicago neighborhoods, especially as fragile financials turn into\nreal-life problems\n: heat that goes out in winter, code violations and revenue that can\u2019t cover rising property taxes. The trouble may be more than just the result of miscalculations by buyers. Much of the underwater real estate in the area was drowned by out-of-state investors whose strategies have drawn scrutiny as federal regulators and lenders look for causes of rampant\nmortgage distress\nin the multifamily industry.\n\u201cWe have certainly seen out-of-state buyers that have invested in the South Side of Chicago,\u201d Matthew Tarshis of Chicago-based Frontline Real Estate Partners said. Frontline frequently serves as a court-appointed receiver for distressed Chicago property. \u201cSome may have been well-intentioned, others may have committed fraud and others may not have known what they were doing. The overarching theme is that a lot of their assumptions were not true to market.\u201d\nCorey Oliver\u2019s Chicago-based property management firm Strength in Management helped stabilize South Side properties caught up in the Better Housing Foundation scam last decade, but he contends that the recent\nspate of problems across the area\u2019s real estate market\nhas had a worse impact.\n\u201cBecause you have artificially inflated the values of properties in this area to an unsustainable level,\u201d Oliver explained.\nOliver was working for landlord Trinity Flood when United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement along with other federal agencies raided her South Shore building last fall, drawing attention to its foreclosure fight. He wouldn\u2019t discuss that property, at 7500 South South Shore Drive, but he and others have grown concerned with\ndubious dealmaking and lending\nthat have left dozens of other nearby buildings in disrepair or uninhabitable due to mismanagement.\n\u201cThere were a lot of guys who came in with less-than-admirable intentions, and built the system,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they did was create comps that unsuspecting people were using to determine the value of their acquisitions. You also have a lot of people who saw buildings sell for $100,000 to $115,000 a door and they saw something at $90,000 a door thinking they were getting a good deal, only to realize it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\nLenders filed 20 foreclosure lawsuits for South Shore buildings with at least five units in 2024, the most in a decade and by far the most out of any Chicago neighborhood that year, the DePaul data shows. The next closest neighborhood was 11 in Chatham, just to the west, where some of South Shore\u2019s same landlords are also grappling with distress, records show.\nFurthermore, out of the 25 Chicago multifamily loans sold into pools of debt on the commercial mortgage-backed securities market and now marked as delinquent for payment, six of them, or nearly a quarter, are backed by property in South Shore. Within the entire Chicago metro area, there are 31 such CMBS loans, meaning nearly 20 percent trace back to South Shore.\nT\nhe rise\nSpeculation within South Shore ramped up in 2017, around the same time affiliates of a firm called Rhodium Capital began buying big chunks of multifamily on Chicago\u2019s South and West sides. Several of them were in South Shore. The firm obtained at least $46 million in Fannie Mae-backed debt from the likes of Arbor Realty Trust and Keybank to assemble a portfolio of more than 540 apartments throughout the city, records show. The investors behind Rhodium, Moshe Silber and Frederick Schulman, were sentenced last year to prison for their involvement in a mortgage fraud scandal in Ohio. Their Chicago real estate activity wasn\u2019t a factor in the criminal case.\nWord seemed to catch on that South Shore was a money maker. Prices for lower-cost multifamily properties in Chicago \u2014 which characterizes South Shore\u2019s stock \u2014 rose to nearly $73,000 per unit in 2024, up from less than $60,000 in 2019, according to the DePaul data that adjusted for inflation and showed the prices for each year in 2024 dollars. That marked a significantly higher relative rise compared to moderately priced apartment buildings while the prices of high-cost units fell over that period. And some of the New York-based buyers were paying well more than average, even though rents and renter incomes didn\u2019t change much over the last few years in the South Side as a whole, DePaul data shows.\n\u201cWhen you have these inflated transactions not driven by market realities, you\u2019re seeing everyday renters feel an affordability impact,\u201d Geoff Smith, executive director and principal investigator of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul, said.\nChicago-based multifamily operators who buy aged buildings and invest into upgrades were boxed out of the market by offers they could never match. Locals were baffled by how buyers like Brooklyn-based Yissocher \u201cIzzy\u201d Rotenberg and Boruch Gottesman were paying so much for properties that, in the estimation of Chicagoans, required extensive repairs.\nT\nhe fall\nBut some of the speculative landlords declined to invest in needed upgrades, and their buildings fell into disrepair. Tenants left for better conditions, and problems spiraled.\nRotenberg had become a prominent landlord in South Shore, owning five buildings there with nearly 100 combined units, plus over a dozen others totaling more than 500 apartments throughout Chicago, mostly in nearby Chatham, Greater Grand Crossing and Auburn Gresham.\nHe eventually landed in the most trouble.\nRecords show that a Rotenberg portfolio purchased for $48 million with $40 million in loans fell into foreclosure, and lenders have seized many of his apartment buildings. He has also drawn lawsuits from multiple people who said they were investors in his Chicago real estate ventures but got cut out of the deals. According to one lawsuit brought by Shulim Kiwak and Yitschok Piller, Rotenberg allegedly kept $1.3 million in insurance proceeds paid out from a fire that destroyed a South Shore property at 7756 South Phillips Avenue and declined to pay his partners $900,000 they said they were owed. The other suit was brought by an investor named Shlomo Horowitz, who claimed Rotenberg never distributed proceeds from a sale of a South Shore property made to Eli Tauber.\n\u201cInvestors come to Chicago because they see good cap rates on paper. What they don\u2019t know is the level of capabilities you need, the level of field team operations, the level of people being there every single day.\u201d\nShaya Wurzberger, Levav Properties\nJudgments against Rotenberg have been issued in both. But he hasn\u2019t appeared in any of the court cases, not since selling property to Tauber, another player facing significant Chicago property distress after partnering with\nMark Nussbaum\n\u2014 the New York real estate attorney indicted for allegedly stealing $15 million from client escrow funds. Tauber and Nussbaum, who pleaded not guilty in the criminal case, bought batches of Chicago properties at surging prices despite the presence of building code violations and, in the case of property previously owned by Rotenberg, even existing foreclosure suits.\nNow, Nussbaum and Tauber are facing 29 foreclosure lawsuits totaling at least $24 million in mortgage debt.\n\u201cInvestors come to Chicago because they see good cap rates on paper. What they don\u2019t know is the level of capabilities you need, the level of field team operations, the level of people being there every single day,\u201d Shaya Wurzberger, an investor from New York, said. Wurzberger is the CEO of Levav Properties, which has been a big buyer of Chicago multifamily in recent years.\nLevav is dealing with its own $12 million foreclosure lawsuit for a portion of its South Side portfolio, though Wurzberger insisted his firm overall isn\u2019t in distress. He claimed Levav bought $100 million of real estate consisting of more than 1,000 apartments in Chicago since 2021. (Property records confirm Levav bought at least 500 units, including some in South Shore, for $50 million between 2022 and early 2025.)\n\u201cAt that time when everybody was buying, prices were going up, I got a little bit involved in that and paid a little too much for this [portion of Levav\u2019s] portfolio,\u201d Wurzberger said.\nWurzberger tried to get the foreclosure lawsuit filed by his lender, New York-based Roc Capital, thrown out of court, but his motion was recently denied by a judge and the case is advancing. But at least he showed up in court.\nBy contrast, other area landlords seem to have turned into shadows, untrackable to their lenders or investors.\nT\nhe mess\nTo be sure, some Chicago-based operators have also played a hand in racking up South Shore\u2019s rate of multifamily distress. A firm called Catalyst Realty run by Stephen Lee and Tyler DeRoo has been facing legal issues, including foreclosures, of properties in the area. (DeRoo was previously involved in the infamous EquityBuild real estate scam in Chicago in the 2010s.)\nChikoo Patel\u2019s Chicago-based firm CKO Real Estate also melted down as tenants in its portfolio of South Side properties, including in South Shore, allegedly went without heat in the winter and the landlord racked up debts he couldn\u2019t repay, including with a credit card company. Patel\u2019s financial backer, Shai Wolkowicki, is suing him; Wolkowicki alleges Patel siphoned $10 million in multifamily investments for personal use.\nBut local groups in distress so far are facing fewer large foreclosure cases than East Coast investors. One difference is that the out-of-state investors entered the South Side multifamily market, and its centerpiece South Shore, late in the game, so they couldn\u2019t get out when interest rate hikes began crushing margins and closing offramps.\nWhile some investors have started to buy up properties from investors like Gottesman and Rotenberg and turn them around with repairs and new leasing strategies, there\u2019s still plenty more financial distress to clean up.\nAnd details about recent deals continue to come out, helping explain what happened.\n\u201cI would guess many of these don\u2019t start out as fraud and maybe they eventually, you know, evolve into that,\u201d said one experienced South Side landlord who bought a portfolio previously controlled by an investor who Fannie Mae blacklisted.\nT\nhe clean-up\nEither way, players grew desperate and began to look for exits. One of them was Mendel Steiner, who died by suicide last year, facing daunting mortgage debt.\nSteiner accumulated a large real estate portfolio nationally; his total Chicago holdings aren\u2019t known. Now, at least seven properties he owned on the South Side, including several in South Shore, are in the midst of foreclosure lawsuits, with lenders alleging that over $11 million in Chicago loans are in default. Steiner\u2019s representatives and estate have been notably absent from court events tied to his property since it started running into trouble; this was true of Steiner before his death.\nA total of nearly $142 million in CMBS loans to Steiner-controlled real estate companies are in default, with the underlying property consisting of apartments in Chicago, Indianapolis and Cincinnati, according to loan servicer notes. There are nearly $61 million in loans for buildings in Steiner\u2019s portfolio that are still making regular payments, the data shows.\nScott Shefman, a court-appointed receiver to Steiner\u2019s distressed Chicago properties, alleged that Leib Steiner, who\u2019s representing Steiner\u2019s estate, isn\u2019t cooperating, even continuing to collect rent from Chicago properties that Steiner owned instead of turning over revenue to the receivership as the court has ordered. The receiver is trying to get the court to compel the estate\u2019s compliance.\nShefman declined to comment and attempts to reach the Steiner estate weren\u2019t successful. Neither Rotenberg nor a member of the Tauber family who has partnered on Chicago transactions with Nussbaum returned requests for comment.\nA lawsuit filed in December seeks to recover approximately $330 million from two entities tied to Steiner, alleging the late investor ran a Ponzi scheme that lured clients and prospective clients of Nussbaum\u2019s law firm, Nussbaum Lowinger, into two investment ploys through which escrow funds were supposedly used to \u201cshow capital\u201d for real estate deals, and another involving fabricated joint ventures tied to property acquisitions.\nPlenty of Chicago property has already turned over to new ownership after foreclosures or other legal problems, as local players get back into buying with plans to spruce up properties using additional capital. Chicago-based Sleeping Bear Capital late last year paid about $2.7 million to buy one of Rotenberg\u2019s former properties from lender Roc Capital, well less than the $3.7 million mortgage Rotenberg borrowed against the property before defaulting, records show. Sleeping Bear obtained a construction mortgage from Providence Bank for over $3.6 million, with plans for updates.\n\u201cThe market now is in a much better place. The people buying now are actual operators,\u201d Wurzberger said.\nBut there\u2019s still plenty of distress working its way through the system tied to out-of-state landlords, regardless of whether mortgage missteps were behind the demise of the deals. In December, Fannie Mae initiated an $18 million foreclosure lawsuit against an entity controlled by Lakewood, New Jersey-based investor Israel Bialostozky, who records show bought the 291-unit South Side portfolio in 2023 from Chaim Joseph Bialostozky; both the buyer and seller have shared the same residential address, according to public records databases. The current owner didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had multiple properties trading at prices that don\u2019t make sense,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cThe only people who really suffer in the end are the community members. Because you end up with a 20-unit building boarded up, that\u2019s no longer part of the tax base, which means your portion of property taxes for your area goes up. Plus you have this blight on your street, which, depending on how it\u2019s maintained by the bank, becomes a haven for crime or becomes a dilapidated building.\u201d",

        "content": "When Igor Gabal bought an office building in downtown Chicago for a 90 percent discount from its last appraisal, the $4 million price tag had one of two interpretations: either the deal was a sign that the property had become virtually worthless since the pandemic or Gabal had just made the best decision of his life.\nThe building, at 300 West Adams, is 12 stories and 240,000 square feet, with decorative terracotta detailing that shows off its era \u2014 the 1920s. But occupancy was only 50 percent, and any owner would have to pay the annual ground lease of about $1.4 million to start.\nFire sales are everywhere. In Houston, San Francisco, Manhattan, Washington, D.C., and Dallas, over 60 percent of office buildings traded in 2025 sold at a markdown from their prior sale price, according to analysis from Yardi Matrix.\nBut what a buyer does after the closing says more about the worth of a building than the headline number or percentage off. Adding value can mean doing updates, increasing tenancy or rebranding.\nFor Gabal, trouble began soon after headlines announced the deal in early 2024, and his investment in the building veered off course. He\u2019s gone through legal trouble and sparred with partners. Meanwhile, the office market hasn\u2019t really recovered, with potential tenants eyeing new or newly renovated Class A office buildings, not older stock.\nHe still has hope. This year, Gabal\u2019s investment will either prove the naysayers wrong or serve as a cautionary tale for bargain buyers who\u2019ve cashed in on what seemed like post-pandemic bargains.\n\u201cThe value is definitely there,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s like we bought $100 for $1.\u201d\nD\naunting competition\nSince Gabal\u2019s purchase, the broader office market has not performed well.\nOut of the full inventory of downtown office space in Chicago, about 29.5 percent is available for rent. That percentage stayed nearly stagnant from 2024, when it came in at 29.4 percent, according to a 2025 year-end report from Savills.\nOne factor keeping vacancy high: new Class A. Just three blocks north of 300 West Adams, the shiny glass-paneled Bank of America tower at 110 North Wacker Drive looms over the Loop. Built in 2020 and 98 percent leased, the building is a glittering example of the high-risk, high-reward landscape of the current office market.\nIn November, lenders threw their confidence behind it, issuing\na $700 million refinancing\nto its landlords, a joint venture of power players Oak Hill Advisors, Callahan Capital Partners and Affinius Capital. It was the largest commercial loan issued in Chicago in 2025, data analysis from The Real Deal found.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like we bought $100 for $1.\u201d\nIgor Gabal\nMeanwhile, former meat-packing district Fulton Market in the West Loop is emerging as the go-to destination for office tenants. Sterling Bay recently listed a building the firm developed at 345 North Morgan with a $70 million construction loan. The 11-story building is a similar size as 300 West Adams but is 94 percent leased with an average lease term of 11 years.\nIf Sterling Bay manages to turn a profit on the sale, the deal will solidify Fulton Market\u2019s dominance in Chicago\u2019s office sector.\nGabal felt the tension. Directly south of Bank of America Tower and west of 345 North Morgan, he spent the two years leading up to that landmark $700 million refinancing languishing in Cook County Circuit Court with his redevelopment plans on hold.\nT\naxes, insurance &amp; lawsuits\nThe auction for 300 West Adams had attracted buyers with less traditional real estate backgrounds, and some of the hopefuls were still circling, unhappy they hadn\u2019t won. A few months after the sale closed in December 2023, a pair of local investors sued Gabal and JLL (on behalf of its brokers), claiming they were cut out of a deal to buy the building.\nThe plaintiffs, John Thomas and a little-known investor, Chris Hansen, alleged that they had planned to buy the building with Gabal but he had put in an offer on his own without their financial backing.\nHad he gotten in on the deal, Thomas hoped to revive the office building along with his own reputation.\nThomas has led a tumultuous career involving two criminal convictions, one stint in federal prison and a role as a mole for the FBI during the investigation of Chicago political fixer Tony Rezko, an associate of disgraced former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. He has said he built a $150 million real estate empire after his 2017 release from prison, but he filed for bankruptcy twice in 2022. He has since exited bankruptcy, public records show.\nThe lawsuit ultimately went in Gabal\u2019s favor but not before the two traded barbs in the press.\n\u201cThey have no wherewithal to execute and are just trying to disturb the normal people who are willing and have the capability to do this,\u201d Gabal said of Thomas and Hansen at the time.\nAfter seeing how things went at the property over the past two years, Thomas said he\u2019s glad he didn\u2019t get in on the deal.\n\u201cI have heart issues now. I actually do. But I think I would have had massive heart attacks if I had been this buyer,\u201d he said.\nNot long after the dust settled with Thomas and Hansen, Gabal was hit with another lawsuit, this time from his business partner, Ruben Espinoza. In a May filing, Espinoza accused Gabal of mishandling a $6.2 million insurance payout tied to water damage at the building.\nIn response, Gabal claimed Espinoza was the one mishandling funds set aside for the building\u2019s operations.\nGabal alleges that Espinoza has withdrawn $1.5 million from the partners\u2019 shared business account without Gabal\u2019s permission and did not respond to repeated requests to stop.\n\u201cI have heart issues now. I actually do. But I think I would have had massive heart attacks if I had been this buyer.\u201d\nJohn Thomas, would-be buyer of 300 West Adams\nAs a result, they were unable to pay property taxes on the building in 2023 and 2024, Gabal\u2019s filing claims.\nMeanwhile, Espinoza has been dealing with a barrage of lawsuits against him. Since 2022, he has been served with at least nine legal complaints from fellow investors, commercial tenants, lenders and even a state senator, at one point topping $80 million in disputes.\nOn top of facing foreclosures filed by lenders, two commercial tenants of Espinoza\u2019s claim he took deposits and first month\u2019s rent for spaces he had already filled with other tenants and refused to refund them.\nMany of the legal disputes involving Espinoza are still pending.\nGabal claims he and Espinoza are close to settling their dispute and that he plans to buy Espinoza out of the ownership of the building.\n\u201cObviously the lawsuits set me back,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I managed to sit down with Espinoza and satisfy his requirements so I can pursue my vision and plan for the building.\u201d Espinoza and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment.\nE\nking out a profit\nSoon free to make decisions on his own, Gabal still has to figure out how to run the building.\nStabilizing a\ndistressed\nbuilding can generate impressive returns but buyers need to have a plan to stay afloat financially during the turnaround process, David Levy of Keen-Summit Capital Partners said. (Levy is also former president of the Midwest chapter of an organization called the Turnaround Management Association.)\n\u201cWhile real estate assets are more illiquid than a stock, the market is dynamic, it\u2019s competitive, and it could take longer than anticipated to to lease up space,\u201d he said.\nAt 300 West Adams, each month that Gabal goes without additional tenants or financing erodes the investor\u2019s bottom line because of the ground lease owned to\nHawaii-based investor Jay Shidler\n, who owns swaths of such ground leases throughout the U.S.\nThe terms of Shidler\u2019s 99-year ground lease include a 3 percent increase each year until 2042, after which the annual payment plateaus to $2.5 million for the remainder of the lease, according to former loan data reports. The amount started at $1 million in 2012.\nGabal plans to convert the first two to three floors to a data center, due to the building\u2019s proximity to a fiber route and the Centrio cooling station. With the right improvements, the remaining space can remain offices, he said.\nFollowing a similar plan, a venture of heavy hitters Mike Reschke\u2019s Prime Group and Quintin Primo\u2019s Capri Investment Group sold the 385,000-square-foot former Cboe Global Markets headquarters at 400 South LaSalle Street for $40 million last fall. The sale came in at almost $104 per square foot \u2014 more than triple the $12 million, or $31 per square foot, that they paid for it a year earlier.\nPrime and Capri bought the wide concrete-and-steel building in July 2024 with an eye toward data center redevelopment. Before selling, they completed early-phase work, including upgrades to power capacity \u2014 a desirable commodity nationwide.\nThe buyer, Arlington, Virginia-based Legacy Investing, plans to transform the six-story property into a 33-megawatt data center slated to go online by late 2026, according to co-founder and managing partner Daniel English.\nBut even doing the groundwork for such a project is expensive. The longer it takes to get started, the more operating costs a building owner incurs in the meantime.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to buy these things and then say, \u2018Okay, now what?\u2019 You want to have a clear plan going in,\u201d Levy said.\nS\nale rack\nDespite two years of struggle at 300 West Adams, Gabal is undeterred from a broader plan to increase his presence in the Loop.\nThe Ukranian-born investor got his start in Chicago real estate by investing in multifamily properties in the \u201990s. But he sold off most of his buildings in 2012 in favor of building a business that specializes in importing European consumer goods ranging from high-end snacks and beverages to supplements and even painter\u2019s tape.\nAfter Covid, the call of real estate was too strong to resist. Gabal continues to look for deals in the Loop, though he feels there\u2019s now more competition.\n\u201cWe came at the lowest point in the market,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the last 24 months \u2026 everybody came into the Loop and started buying.\u201d\nSo far, it\u2019s not clear if the market has reached the bottom. Other bargain hunters are still circling. In early 2025, Namdar, known for buying distressed malls, bought 70 West Madison for $85 million, a 77 percent discount from its last sale price of $375 million in 2014.\nGabal has also been pursuing a purchase of the distressed debt tied to the ground lease (also held by the Shidler Group) under The Burnham Center, the historic 22-story office building at 111 West Washington where he\u2019s partnering with Reschke on the acquisition.\nLike his plans at 300 West Adams, the deal has yet to finalize.",

        "content": "It\u2019s not just the blue states: Some local leaders in the Lone Star State are turning a cold shoulder to their federal colleagues with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nThe federal agency, currently under fire for its hand in civilian killings in Minneapolis, reportedly\nbought a 1-million-square-foot warehouse\nin the Dallas suburb of Hutchins, with plans to turn it into a detention center, the Washington Post first reported in December.\nThe facility would be able to hold up to 9,500 people, rattling a city with a population under 8,000. Hutchins Mayor Mario Vasquez told local ABC affiliate\nWFAA\nthat he\u2019s opposed to the plan, saying warehouses in the town of 8,000 \u201care for storage, not for holding people.\u201d\n\u201cWho wants an ICE facility in their backyard?\u201d he asked rhetorically when pressed about his opposition.\nICE hasn\u2019t confirmed the purchase, but the Clergy League for Emergency Action and Response said the transaction and location, at 950 North I-45, are an open secret, D Magazine\nreported\n.\nElsewhere in the Texas Triangle, ICE is eyeing a 640,000-square-foot warehouse in San Antonio, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n. The warehouse has been unoccupied for almost three years. The source that confirmed ICE is considering the property at 542 SE Loop 410 also told the outlet that the agency is scouting property in McAllen, on the U.S.-Mexico border..\nBexar County Commissioner Tommy Calvert vowed to fight the purchase.\n\u201cThese facilities are a front for more nefarious things to come if we don\u2019t stop them,\u201d he said in a statement to the San Antonio Business Journal.\nThere\u2019s no record of a transaction, but the rumors come amid a flood of reports that ICE is juicing up its real estate holdings across the country.\nHoles in S2\u2019s shield against syndicator crash out\nWhen Scott Everett\nlaunched the largest private REIT\nin 2024, the move was hailed by the industry as a clever escape hatch from the all-too-familiar syndicator crash out that took down his peers.

        "content": "There\u2019s been chatter around\nalternative building materials\nin the fire rebuild, but do ultra-high-net-worth buyers care?\nThe audience for\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s \u201cBuilding Luxury\u201d panel held Jan. 27 in Beverly Hills was keen to bat the idea around.\nTRD\nhosted Coldwell Banker Realty\u2019s Jade Mills, Redeavor\u2019s Mike Leipart and Huntington Estate Properties\u2019 Ramtin Ray Nosrati for a wide-ranging discussion, but the one topic that got most people talking? Alternatives to homes built with wood.\nTo date, the market has seen steel frame makers, panelized housing manufacturers and others using concrete enter the picture with pitches of more fire-resistant structures. About a week ago, press, local government officials and residents gathered to watch a pre-fab home get dropped onto an\nAltadena lot\nby crane.\nLuxury home developer Ardie Tavangarian, whose Arya Group is focused on fire-resistant homes, told\nTRD\nearlier this week it\u2019s not realistic \u201cto continue constructing wood-frame houses the same way,\u201d and the outstanding question is whether such elements add to a home\u2019s value as much as, say, imported finishes from Milan or health and wellness amenities.\nThe consensus Tuesday was there is no consensus.\nA big test may come in Malibu where\nZuru Tech US\nis looking to test its prefab housing made in off-site factories at lots it bought in Malibu. Will the alternative building materials pique buyer interest, command a premium, or be an afterthought?\nMeasure ULA relief?\nNot quite. And, for residential, not really.\nThat\u2019s the short of it when it comes to a\nproposal to amend\nL.A.\u2019s so-called mansion tax, which was introduced by City Councilmember Nithya Raman on Jan. 23. The fourth district representative on Tuesday sought to get her peers on the 15-member city council to fast-track a\nJune ballot measure\namending Measure United to House L.A. She proposed a 15-year exemption on new multifamily, commercial and mixed-use projects. The driver behind the proposal is to promote more multifamily construction \u2014 a major tenet of ULA, when voters agreed to pass the two-tier tax on real estate transactions to fund housing and homelessness prevention programs.\nFor L.A. \u2018s single-family, residential market, properties impacted by a natural disaster would be eligible for a one-time, three-year carveout from ULA in Raman\u2019s proposal. It\u2019s a small bone tossed at the industry segment, with many residential agents saying for the nearly three years the tax has been around that it\u2019s stalled deals and chilled interest among spec developers to want to buy land and build homes within the city. Some agents point to the argument that many property owners\u2019 retirements are bound up in the value of their homes. Others argue $5.3 million \u2014 the floor triggering the 4 percent levy (its 5.5 percent on deals of $10.3 million or more) \u2014 doesn\u2019t really buy a mansion in L.A.\nAs of December, the median sales price for a home in the city was a little over $1 million, up about 2 percent from the year-ago comparison, according to Redfin.\nNumbers game\nOne more point on\nULA\n. Both sides of the issue have weaponized data to prove their point.\nThat\u2019s not noteworthy. What is notable is what Raman pointed out to her City Council peers on Tuesday in apologizing for \u201csurprising\u201d anyone with her proposal, which skipped over public discourse in any committee before she brought it to the floor of the body.\nRaman said she was in conversation with housing groups, Measure ULA coalition members, labor, the business community. In some cases, she added, fellow elected officials were also involved in talks during the months leading up to her motion.\n\u201cBut after many months, we weren\u2019t even able to agree on what data was important to monitor or what people cared about,\u201d she pointed out Tuesday.\nWhile the possibility of getting the idea onto the June ballot is gone with the Jan. 28 deadline lapsed for the council to instruct the city attorney to formalize such a move, changes to the tax remain up for consideration in the Housing and Homelessness Committee and with the ULA Citizen Oversight Committee.\nStill, if a baseline to gauge success can\u2019t even be determined, any ULA changes would seem to face an uphill battle.\nBouncing back\nIn case you missed it, this week saw sellers creep back into the market. With holiday travels over and kids going back to school, agents expect a buying bounceback.\nNinety-nine properties listed in the Multiple Listing Service for at least $4 million were added to Los Angeles County\u2019s inventory for the week ended Jan. 25, according to Douglas Elliman\u2019s\nEklund Gomes\nteam. That brought the number of active listings to 1,131.\nAmong the new entrants is spec developer and The Agency principal\nSantiago Arana\n\u2019s 401 North Tigertail Road in Brentwood. It\u2019s listed for $65 million, or $3,250 per square foot, after the \u201cBuying Beverly Hills\u201d cast member spent four years on construction.\nThere\u2019s also the historic Hollywood Hills home once owned by \u201cThe Price is Right\u201d host\nBob Barker\n. That property reappeared on the market last week with an asking price of $7.4 million, or $1,252 per square foot, for the home in the Outpost Estates neighborhood. The property\u2019s got history with Los Angeles Times Publisher Harrison Gray Otis and later Hollywood developer Charles Toberman also calling 1851 Outpost Drive home at one time or another.\nListing agent Zac Mostame, of Carolwood Estates, said he\u2019s optimistic with activity picking back up that Barker\u2019s former home will trade before summer.\n",

        "content": "The most expensive house in Texas is nearing its 90th birthday.\nDesigned for an Italian count by Swiss-American architect Maurice Fatio, whose other clients included the Rockefellers and the Vanderbilts, the\nCrespi Estate\nat 5619 Walnut Hill Lane in Dallas is asking $64 million, about $2,300 per square foot. The Coxes, family of Edwin Cox, primary benefactor of Southern Methodist University\u2019s Cox School of Business, are the sellers.\nUnlike its closest rival at the top of the Texas residential market, a\nHouston castle\nbuilt by the seller in 2005 and listed for $60 million, the Crespi Estate has proved its mettle before. It was the state\u2019s most expensive sale of 2016 according to Dallas real estate titan Allie Beth Allman, when Texas Rangers owner Tom Hicks sold it to billionaire banker Andy Beal. It topped the list again a year later, when developer\nMehrdad Moayedi\nbought it at auction for $36.2 million. He sold it to the Cox family two years later with an asking price of $38 million.\nThe Jazz Age mansion, on a 16-acre lot in one of Dallas\u2019 most prestigious neighborhoods, has more than 27,000 square feet of living space, including a ballroom. It shares the lot with gardens, greenhouses, tennis courts, a guest room, a heliport and, of course, a pool.\nThe Texas luxury market is steadying after a pendulous five years, and sellers could use a sure thing. If the home sells for anywhere close to asking, it could settle the score on an open question about the value of being old in a land known for building new: Is it good or bad that Crespi hails from 1938?\nC\noncrete crumbles,\ns\ntone holds\nAs the Texas luxury market slows, many agents say the right buyer will pay a premium for a well-preserved masterwork.\n\u201cHistoric homes tend to perform better long-term,\u201d said Emily Waldmann, a Douglas Elliman agent who specializes in architecturally significant properties. \u201cIf [a] home that\u2019s really special, that\u2019s been around for a hundred years, finally hits the market \u2014 and this is your one chance before it switches ownership for another 30 years \u2014 you\u2019re more likely going to swing the bat.\u201d\nLocal data illustrates her point. Since 2000, the Swedish Hill Historic District in 78702 has appreciated more than any other ZIP code in the Austin area, with average home sale prices nearly nine times higher now than at the turn of the century, according to\nTeam Price Real Estate\n. It was one of a minority of neighborhoods where values continued to go up between 2024 and 2025, a period when\nluxury inventory grew\nand\nsales declined\nin every major Texas metro.\nMeanwhile, the average home sale price in Tarrytown, the prestigious neighborhood where actress Emma Stone recently sold her home, appreciated at a far slower rate: barely quadrupling in the last 25 years. The area\u2019s homes depreciated more than any other ZIP code in the city between 2024 and 2025, with home sale prices declining by 10.5 percent.\n\u201cThat\u2019s where I hope that they engage a great architect.\u201d\nPogir on new builds that succeed historic homes\nStudies throughout the country have found that designated historic homes appreciate faster than other properties in most cycles and generally track the rate of the market in the worst case, according to an\nanalysis\nof research conducted in several states, including Texas.\nAgents in other areas of the state agree that a properly maintained piece of history can motivate a buyer in a way that contemporary homes can\u2019t. Pogir, the Briggs Freeman Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agent who\u2019s co-listing the Crespi Estate with Diane DuVall, saw such enchantment firsthand with the Grady Vaughn house at 5350 South Dentwood Drive, a 9,500-square-foot Mid-Century Modern designed by Robert Goodwin in 1951, one of the largest of its kind. In 2020, a New York businessman bought the property sight unseen.\nThat buyer tapped an architect from Austin who specialized in renovating these older homes, a crucial move.\nA good restoration matters. If a house hasn\u2019t been \u201cflipperized with gray everything,\u201d its history \u2014 and therefore its scarcity \u2014 will carry it through the stormiest markets, according to Houston agent Robert Searcy, who specializes in architecturally significant properties and formerly owned the oldest documented privately owned home in\nHouston\n.\n\u201cThe houses that retain their historical character and have not been \u2014 the term I use is \u2018remuddled\u2019 \u2014 I think that the demand will always outstrip the supply,\u201d Searcy said. \u201cGood times, bad times.\u201d\nD\nirt-rich\nFor historic homes in the luxury class, the good times can prove more challenging than the bad. Even if the invisible hand passes over the state\u2019s Georgian manors, Victorian gingerbreads and Mid-Century Modern pads during downturns, it threatens them during upswings.\nThat\u2019s the case in Dallas, one of the fastest-appreciating areas in the country in the last 25 years. The state\u2019s ultra-luxury hub is also notably flashier than the other metros; while Austin\u2019s top sales tend to spread along the more remote stretches of the Colorado River, far west of the city, Dallas\u2019 top neighborhoods are nestled in the center of town, often right on the sidewalk. An\nAustin mansion\nis a hideaway; a Dallas mansion is a statement. (In the Park Cities, shallow lots\nreportedly\nsell better than deep, tree-hidden parcels.)\nTexas historic homes can weather recession; growth is another matter.\nAlthough data shows that historic districts remain buoyant during downturns, few historic homes qualify as luxury. Conversely, even to luxury buyers who are in the market for a historic home, craftsmanship and character matter more than official recognition, according to agents. That\u2019s why it\u2019s difficult to gauge the market performance of luxury homes considered historic \u2014 there\u2019s no way to comprehensively measure the value of a home with a respected architect and rare materials against another property that\u2019s simply old.\n\u201cThe plaque by the front door or the front gate is more novelty than anything. Whether it\u2019s designated historic or not, it\u2019s all about the architecture and the character and the vibe of the house,\u201d Searcy said.\n\u201cAn appraiser does not have a line item to assign value [to] things [like] architectural interest, character [or] charm,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the real world, they absolutely make an incredible difference in the value and the days on market.\u201d\nBecause urban historic homes tend to be centrally located, and rural historic homes tend to nest in legacy ranches, their high land value further complicates appraisals of the homes themselves.\nAn hour west of Austin in the Hill Country, Sotheby\u2019s agent Kris Forks is representing a 417-acre homestead outside of Fredericksburg with a main house built in the 1870s. While the two-bedroom stone house is unlikely to become a millionaire\u2019s party pad, it\u2019s a significant selling point, Forks says. The property\u2019s $7 million asking price amounts to almost $17,000 per acre, a fair stretch above the area\u2019s average sale price of $14,500 per acre for unimproved rural land, according to the Texas Real Estate Research Center.\n\u201cIf this home was in the middle of downtown, versus the contemporary home in the middle of downtown, there\u2019s absolutely a buyer for the historic home,\u201d Forks said.\nBut that downtown two-bed faces a different economic pressure. For urban historic properties, land can swallow up a greater share of the properties\u2019 total value over time as the cities grow around them, particularly if they\u2019re on large lots or in neighborhoods going through periods of rapid appreciation.\nFew cities have appreciated faster than Dallas, which has earned a reputation for demolishing historic mansions.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of times when the dirt outweighs what the value is worth to redo it, and it makes more sense to tear them down,\u201d according to Michael Humphries, an agent with the hyper-local Dallas brokerage Allie Beth Allman &amp; Associates.\nIn other words, treasure to historic-homes enthusiasts, blight to contemporary spec builders and their buyers.\nAnd while an original Hal Thomson \u2014 he designed grand Beaux-Arts and French Eclectic mansions throughout Dallas in the 1910s and \u201920s \u2014 might stay buoyed in a low market, a rising tide can easily overwhelm it.\n\u201cNobody can stop anybody from knocking anything down,\u201d Pogir said. \u201cSome incredible homes in Dallas \u2026 have been demolished,\u201d he added, mentioning the 105-year-old Trammell Crow estate, torn down in 2017, and the Cox Estate, a Beaux-Arts mansion razed in 2024. A 1918 neoclassical designed by Thomson at 4908 Lakeside Drive was reduced to land three years ago by William and Marilyn Oates, who sold it to an LLC.\nN\new history\nA significant architect can preserve the worth of a classic luxury home, but that won\u2019t bulletproof it. The Crespi Estate itself came close to demolition.\nBeal reportedly gutted much of the kitchen before he sold it to Moayedi, and Moayedi trimmed away parcels of the property\u2019s valuable dirt to develop the Crespi Estates, a subdivision of spec luxury homes, before he sold it to the Cox family.\nIronically, neoclassical imitations of prewar mansions often replace the doomed originals in Dallas. Newer homes in Preston Hollow and the Park Cities evince the influence of Italian villas and French chateaux, much like the mansions that preceded them under the wrecking ball. The signature of architect Robbie Fusch, a traditionalist who draws his plans by hand, boosts any listing; Fusch is famous for the $7.3 million Theta sorority house at Southern Methodist University, a Georgian design that replaced a smaller 1951 construction. He also designed the second most expensive sale of 2025, a $25.5 million manor at 4000 Euclid Avenue in Dallas with a gilded basilica-style dome and limestone floors, corniced fireplace and bronze hardware imported from France.\nAnother Fusch design, the \u201cWhite House of Dallas\u201d at 10777 Strait Lane, was on the market for $40 million for several months last year. The third most expensive home to sell in Texas last year was a neoclassical spec mansion at 1 Dorset Place in Dallas \u2014 complete with a pediment, a Diocletian window and an entablature above the front entrance \u2014 designed by Richard Drummond Davis Architects, another firm that specializes in classic architecture, which sold after asking $23 million.\nOverall, the top sales and listings of the state suggest a significant appetite among ultra-luxury buyers for homes that feel historic \u2014 pillars and pediments, quoins and quadrangles. If the Carrera marble floor was laid before World War II, all the better. If not, does it matter?\nAnd in a century, when Fusch, Davis and other neoclassical designers have acquired the patina of history, will it shield their work from the demands of Texas\u2019 elite?\nThe survival of the Crespi Estate through several record-setting sales and brushes with the bulldozer demonstrates the yin-and-yang relationship between the connoisseur and the developer in Texas. The estate could easily go to a buyer who envisions a bigger, better, bespoke home on 16 acres in Preston Hollow. At the same time, its value depends at least partially on such developers culling the competition for the right buyer\u2019s eye.\n\u201cThat\u2019s where I hope that they engage a great architect,\u201d Pogir said of buyers who demolish historic homes. \u201cSo at least they\u2019ve knocked something down of quality. They\u2019re putting something else up of quality.\u201d",

Shawn Todd\u2019s firm spent $460 million carving the project out of the long-vacant former First National Bank Tower.\nTodd Interests still owes about $230 million on the $245 million loan from Starwood, Todd told the Dallas Morning News.\nThe news comes at a difficult time for Downtown Dallas, which is still reeling from AT&amp;T\u2019s announcement of plans to move its headquarters from downtown to Plano. The foreclosure also follows Todd Interests\u2019 sale of its stake in the nearby East Quarter to J.P. Morgan Asset Management.\nThe Starwood loan makes up more than a quarter of the value of troubled loans in the Texas Triangle headed to auction this month. The sum totals $805 million, making February the third month in a row where the value of troubled CRE loans\ntops $800 million\nin Texas.\nHere are the biggest loans up for auction. It\u2019s possible that some of these borrowers and lenders will reach agreements to avoid auction.\nHouston\nThis month\u2019s largest new loan flagged for auction in Harris County is a nearly 150-acre swath of partially developed land zoned for industrial development. The property at 2012 Miller Cut Off Road in La Porte is the site of an old power plant. An entity tied to industrial developer Genover provided a $30 million loan for the property in 2022. The owner is St. Petersburg, Florida-based Trak Commercial. Loan documents dated Thursday show the owner secured new financing for the property, a $38.8 million loan from JGB Capital.\nAustin\nIt\u2019s been less than a year since Austin-based One Development secured a $14 million loan for townhome project Rosemark Woodland, and it\u2019s already being accused of default. The 27-unit Austin condo community, at 2209 Woodland Avenue, opened last year. Arixa provided the loan, which works out to just under $519,000 per condo.\nSan Antonio\nThe\nfallout from the passage of House Bill 21\ncontinues with the foreclosure of Acadia on the Lake Apartments, at 4031 Thousand Oaks Drive in San Antonio. David Shippy\u2019s Quantum Leap Property Management allegedly defaulted on a $31.3 million loan provided by CBRE in 2025 for the 304-unit property built in 1982. Quantum Leap faced foreclosure on another San Antonio apartment complex for the same reason just last month.\nQuantum Leap partnered with Edcouch Community Housing Finance Corporation to get property tax breaks on Acadia on the Lake Apartments, using a loophole known as a \u201ctraveling\u201d housing finance corporation. Quantum Leap sold the property to Edcouch, an affordable housing organization 250 miles from San Antonio, and leased the ground.\nGov. Greg Abbott signed a bill closing the loophole\n, which became a popular cost-cutting tool for multifamily syndicators and investors. Some appraisal districts have interpreted the new law as justification to remove tax credits for loophole users, even though the law gives operators a few years to come into compliance.\nDallas\nAs detailed above, the biggest troubled loan in Dallas this cycle is the one tied to The National. In addition to the financing from Starwood, the redevelopment project was buoyed by about $100 million in historic credits and $50 million in city tax increment financing. The project transformed the long-vacant skyscraper into a blend of apartments, hotel rooms, offices and retail.\nFort Worth\nVertical Street Ventures is facing foreclosure on The Sherry, a 252-unit apartment complex at 2208 East Park Row Drive in Arlington. ReadyCap provided the $24.4 million mortgage for the property in 2021. The debt on the property built in 1968 works out to $97,000 per unit.\nRepeat offenders\nOf the properties scheduled for auction, nine have been flagged for foreclosure multiple times, sometimes reflecting a loan modification or ongoing litigation. Here are the properties that have been on the block before:\nLatitude 2976\n, a 734-unit apartment complex at 201 and 301 Wilcrest Drive in Houston ($77.2 million loan);\nVeranda Village, a 330-unit apartment complex at 3536 Shaver Street in Pasadena ($47.2 million loan);\nThe Co-Op at the Med Center, a 199-unit apartment complex at 7710 Main Street in Houston ($25 million loan);\nSan Antonio Marriott Northwest Medical Center, at 3323 Northwest Loop 410 in San Antonio ($18.5 million loan)\nWyndham Garden Austin, at 3401 South Interstate 35 ($13.4 million loan);\nA 270,000-square-foot office building at 10777 Clay Road\u00a0 in Houston ($10.5 million loan);\nA retail building at 6610 Low Bid Lane home to Soccer Central in San Antonio ($10.5 million loan);\nMar Del Sol Apartments, a 248-unit building at 9303 Woodfair Drive in Houston ($10 million loan); and\nLa Bella Vista Apartments, a 152-unit complex at 3600 South Shaver Street in Houston ($9.2 million loan).\n",

The approval allows Minto to build a maximum of 13,270 dwelling units, with 11,880 single-family homes and 1,390 multifamily and mixed-use units \u2014 double the amount of single-family homes permitted under the land\u2019s former zoning, according to\ncity documents\n. Minto plans to include townhomes as well as apartments.\nThe yet-to-be-named community will be the largest residential and mixed-use development in the area, Minto said in a press release. Based on household occupancy estimates, the community could house up to 33,902 people, about 65 percent of Waxahachie\u2019s current population, according to the city council.\nThe land is mostly agricultural, but it also includes a Presbyterian Children\u2019s Homes and Services location and a smattering of single-family houses. Arizona-based land asset manager Walton Global currently owns most of the land. Minto has an agreement with Walton to purchase it, according to a memorandum filed with the county last year.\nDense development plans have led to controversy in the area recently. Local landowners sued another developer, Lillian Custom Homes, for allegedly violating deed restrictions that prevent more than two homes on any 5-acre tract in Oak Creek Ranch, a project underway just across FM 875.\nThe Supreme Court of Texas sided with the developer\nlast summer.\nMinto plans to include 400 acres of open space and parks, according to the release. The community will also include a middle school and multiple elementary schools, the company stated.\nTexas is a leading market for master-planned communities, hosting 20 of the top 50 best-selling communities in America in 2025, according to\nRCLCO\n.\nStarwood recently bought a portfolio of master-planned communities from Hines\n, including Myrtle Creek, a 1,260-acre community set to include 2,500 homes in Waxahachie.\n",

        "content": "The standoff in Boca Raton started with a prayer.\n\u201cAs we conduct the people\u2019s business here today, we pray that we do so with wisdom, maintaining a sense of proportion,\u201d Boca Raton City Council Member Andy Thomson said.\nThe call wasn\u2019t exactly answered.\nThomson was presiding over a city council meeting in February 2025 at which elected officials would select a partner for a major public-private redevelopment. By the end of the meeting, Thomson and the council unanimously approved a bid from Terra and Frisbie Group for a 2.5 million-square-foot multi-use project on Boca\u2019s aging government campus, 30 acres of public land. The vision was to transform Boca\u2019s downtown into a tropical modern transit-oriented mini metropolis fit for an emerging hub of wealth and commerce. It was called \u201cOne Boca.\u201d\nOne Boca had its skeptics. Where some saw a beautiful update, others saw a travesty of monstrous proportions. At issue was the project site, which included Boca\u2019s 17-acre Memorial Park, named in 1947 to honor World War II veterans. The current city hall, community center, two baseball fields, a skate park, shuffleboard courts, the Boca Raton Tennis Center and six beloved banyan trees all sit within Memorial Park.\nThe way Jon Pearlman saw it, \u201cthey were going to destroy all of that and build high-rise condos.\u201d\nPearlman, a resident and tennis player who knew the Memorial Park courts well, had never been involved in community organizing before One Boca. But after he started talking to neighbors, he chartered a\ngrassroots movement\n, gathering signatures for petitions to fight the project. He called it \u201cSave Boca.\u201d\n\u201cThe world is changing faster than it ever has before. We don\u2019t want to miss the future.\u201d\nCody Crowell, Frisbie Group\nCoconut Grove-based Terra, led by David Martin, has wrangled with public dissent before. So has its partner, the Palm Beach-based family firm Frisbie, led by Rob Frisbie Jr. and his brother-in-law Cody Crowell.\n\u201cIn the beginning, there were some very serious concerns that would resonate with a lot of people,\u201d Frisbie said, acknowledging the resistance around parkland preservation and honoring veterans.\nAs local development fights so often do, things got heated. Terra and Frisbie adapted plans to heed Save Boca\u2019s major concerns, but the group remained staunch in its opposition, Frisbie said. Decorum lapsed at tense city meetings. Lawsuits were filed. City officials, Terra, Frisbie, Pearlman and even appraisers were all at some point accused of ill intentions, of lying, of misleading \u201cthe people.\u201d\nBut allegations of compromised public servants and systems silenced a simpler truth: Boca was changing, and to many of its residents, it was too much, too fast.\nThe events that came next suggest that developer-community standoffs have reached a new pitch in an age of fraying truth and trust. Within six months of that first vote on the One Boca bid, wisdom and any sense of proportion were gone. A developer might note the rise of distrust and conspiratorial thinking elsewhere in society, but it\u2019s hard to prepare for when your project inspires the rallying cry to revolt.\nSeeing few other options, Terra, Frisbie and the city council agreed to a new approach. By the end of the summer they had conceded to send One Boca to a\nreferendum\n, leaving the future of the project up to the people.\n\u201cI hope that they take the time to consider the facts and vote their conscience,\u201d Mayor Scott Singer said.\nThe vote is set for Tuesday, March 10.\nH\now it started\nBoca had been looking at redeveloping its government campus for years. The facilities are more than 30 years old and have damage from floods. The city\u2019s bidding process for the project pitted titans of South Florida real estate against one another.\nMartin\u2019s Terra and Frisbie teamed up on a proposal. Also in the mix was Related Ross, the West Palm Beach-based Goliath helmed by billionaire Steve Ross.\nMartin is no amateur, but he was sidling up to Ross on his home turf. For Frisbie and Crowell, the campus redevelopment was an opportunity to level up. The company, founded by Frisbie\u2019s father and uncles, has historically focused on small, luxury projects: spec homes, townhomes, a boutique resort in the Florida Keys. The second generation has grander ambitions. They have partnered with 1789 Capital on a $1 billion real estate investment fund and are planning another project with Martin with more than 1,000 residential units.\nThey had some early stumbles. In 2021, they partnered with Hines to buy a West Palm Beach development site and planned a Robert A.M. Stern-designed condo project now known as South Flagler House. After a legal spat with Two Roads Development, the partners sold the project to Steve Ross for $194.6 million. The Frisbie Group\u2019s Suzanne Frisbie is leading sales with the Corcoran Group at the project. In 2024, the family sought to redevelop a rare 5.8-acre Palm Beach site, but local pushback killed the project.\nOne Boca represents an untested scale and scope for the Frisbies, a project that could establish them on the new path.\nTheir initial vision for One Boca spanned a 30-acre city-owned site at 201 West Palmetto Park Road. Designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox, the architecture firm that envisioned Hudson Yards in New York and Covent Garden in London, it would have 250,000 square feet of offices, 157,000 square feet of retail, 1,129 residential units, a 150-key hotel and 3,434 parking spaces, all adjacent to the city\u2019s Brightline station.\nThe developers would replace the existing city hall with one totaling 100,000 square feet, as well as a 50,600-square-foot community center. In this iteration of the proposal, the city planned to sign a 99-year lease with Terra and Frisbie, with the developers paying $5.1 million in annual rent. Their projections showed the developers paying the city more than $3 billion over the course of the lease.\nGlossy renderings showed a smooth, bright, lushly landscaped civic center packed with pedestrians relishing the spectacular Boca of tomorrow.\n\u201cThe world is changing faster than it ever has before,\u201d Crowell said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to miss the future.\u201d\nT\nhe future is Florida\nThe pandemic instigated a generational boom in South Florida. In Boca, single-family home prices nearly doubled in a five-year span. A town that 60 years ago did not have a hospital was becoming a magnet for billionaires who liked the low taxes and private airport.\nThis spurred a wave of real estate investment unparalleled almost anywhere in the country. Residents in Boca watched what happened as developers poured billions into projects across the region, with particular concentration in Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach. Some didn\u2019t want to be part of the wave.\n\u201cBoca Raton is not what West Palm Beach is becoming,\u201d Pearlman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a Fort Lauderdale and it\u2019s not a Miami.\u201d\nThe sartorial signature of his opposition movement is a graphic T-shirt in stark white with a bright green block around the navy text: SAVE BOCA. Every email, flyer and blog post from the organization comes bolded, in all caps, seeming to mimic the urgent, assertive speaking style of the group\u2019s founder.\nSpeaking from the podium is new for Pearlman, who works in investment management. The former Harvard tennis player also started a fitness brand, Mission Lean, with his wife Lyudmila Bouzinova, a one-time \u201cAmerica\u2019s Next Top Model\u201d contestant.\nHe has compared the One Boca project to destroying Central Park. On Save Boca\u2019s YouTube channel, a video of AI-generated bulldozers plowing down Memorial Park\u2019s banyan trees has more than 80,000 views.\nAfter its launch, Save Boca issued two nearly identical petitions. They called for city ordinance and charter amendments that would restrict the city\u2019s ability to lease and sell its public lands. Under Save Boca\u2019s proposed laws, decisions concerning public parcels half an acre or larger would require a referendum.\nThis would mean that nearly every public land use decision would require mobilizing the electorate. City officials raised the alarm.\n\u201cIf the ordinance proposed by this petition had been in place, Boca Raton would\u2019ve lost out on our new Blue Lake Elementary School and more than a thousand needed student seats,\u201d Singer, the mayor, wrote in a statement in July.\nThrough the summer, support for Save Boca swelled. By September, Pearlman had thousands of signatures, although the precise count is a source of debate between the Save Boca and One Boca camps. Pearlman claims Save Boca has 12,900 supporters throughout the city. According to Singer, that is a double count of about 6,000 people who signed both petitions.\nAfter submitting the petitions to send his proposals to a vote, Pearlman started expanding his political movement. He launched a campaign for city council in October, running against incumbent Marc Widger, a consistent supporter of One Boca. The mounting support for the Save Boca laws inspired concerns from a new entrant: locals who feared the consequences of handicapping city decisionmaking. In November, attorney Ned Kimmelman filed suit against Pearlman and Save Boca, seeking an emergency injunction to block the referendums concerning the public land use rules.\n\u201cSave Boca and Pearlman are conducting an audacious scheme to evade Florida law and abuse our electoral process in Palm Beach County and the City,\u201d the lawsuit read.\nWithin a few weeks, the judge granted the injunction. Kimmelman responded to the decision in a letter to the editor published in the Boca Raton Tribune.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t use an atomic bomb to kill a single government project or anything else, for that matter, because it will kill you, too,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTo the good people who got snookered and almost destroyed our city, they need to read the tale of the Pied Piper of Hamelin because it almost happened to them, to all of us. Jon Pearlman and all of the Save Boca founders cannot be permitted to run for public office.\u201d\nThe lawsuit is ongoing. Like so many elements of the battle over One Boca, the divergent sides disagree on the details. They give alternating reasons for why the judge granted the injunction, and whether Pearlman\u2019s proposed laws were themselves legal.\nAsked why he thinks Kimmelman sued him, Pearlman said, \u201cI have no idea about his motivations, but everything he alleges is false.\u201d\nF\nacts and fictions\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Terra, Frisbie or the Boca electeds have encountered unhappy communities. Developers have playbooks for this kind of fight: collaborate, make concessions, give back.\n\u201cOne of his main attributes, especially when dealing with government, is listening to what the other side needs, and trying to get them what they need,\u201d Bilzin Sumberg attorney Suzanne Amaducci said of Martin, Terra\u2019s head, in\nThe Real Deal\nprofile\nof Martin from 2024.\nAgainst the backdrop of Save Boca\u2019s allegations and demands, Terra and Frisbie have altered their proposal, keeping it alive. In September, they\nreduced the scale\nof the project, and in October, they shrunk it again.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the mega project has necessarily gone miniature. The 99-year lease between the city and the developers includes 7.8 acres, and One Boca will cover 538,000 square feet. The plans include 120,000 square feet of office, a 30,000-square-foot grocery store, 765 apartments, a 180-key hotel and 2,100 parking spaces. Terra and Frisbie are also in contract to buy the adjacent 0.8-acre site at 140 Northwest 4th Street, where they plan a 182-unit condominium. Recreation and green space increases from 7.6 acres to 15.6 acres. Projections now show One Boca generating $4 billion in revenue for the city from rent and tax revenues over the life of the deal. Terra and Frisbie have also agreed to maintain their contributions to Boca even if Gov. Ron DeSantis is successful in his push to abolish property taxes. Under the latest plan, the city will lead the redesign of Memorial Park and its playgrounds, tennis courts and other recreational uses. It would also include a dedicated veterans memorial. The baseball fields would be relocated, as would the police department\u2019s headquarters. The Memorial Park site would still include a\nredeveloped\ncity hall, community center and police substation.\nOn Jan. 20, seven weeks before the referendum, the city council voted to approve the Master Partnership Agreement (MPA) with Terra and Frisbie, officially sending this proposal to the March ballot.\nBut the changes have done nothing to sway Pearlman, who continues to assert that the developers aren\u2019t preserving the park. He also suggests Boca has plenty of money to redevelop city hall on its own, claiming it has more than $600 million in the bank, which Singer denies.\n\u201cThe city could not pay for these improvements just from existing funds,\u201d he said. Without a public private partnership, Boca would need to raise taxes, do a bond or cut funding for services to afford the needed updates.\nAs of publication, both sides are projecting confidence.\n\u200b\u200b\u201cThe fate of this project could very well shape the entire future of this city,\u201d Pearlman said. He still maintains that Terra and Frisbie will bulldoze the banyans, cut off access to Memorial Park and inflate the revenue benefits for the city.\n\u201cSome people just live in a state of confusion,\u201d Frisbie\u2019s Crowell said. \u201cThe other side has not been listening.\u201d\nHe insists the developers are listening to citizens. \u201cPeople can trust us.\u201d",

The property, at 1775, 1757 and 1751 Collins Avenue, includes the historic Raleigh hotel. Developer Michael Shvo and his partners exited the project. One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty previously handled sales.\nThe new sales team is made up of Compass agents Miltiadis Kastanis, Pablo Alfaro, Ivan Chorney, Michael Martirena and Liz Hogan, according to a news release. Morgan Ball, senior managing director of Florida for Compass\u2019 development marketing arm, and Kastanis were involved in securing the deal starting last year.\nKastanis, who\nleft Douglas Elliman nearly a year ago\n, said the sales team will focus on buyers and brokers who appreciate and understand the project.\n\u201cThe brokerage community becomes your buyer,\u201d he said. \u201cOne thing that will have changed is the sales approach. As much as it will be private and exclusive, it\u2019s going to be approachable.\u201d\nThe developer will announce a sales director and timeline to re-launch sales at a later date. Ball, who moved to Miami late last year, said Compass has a \u201clong and extensive\u201d history with Nahla.

        "content": "\u201c\nI\nt\u2019s a long way down.\u201d\nWhen Cedar Street Partners\u2019\nJonathan Curtis\nsaid this to a guest peering over the edge of the 20th floor patio at a Glendale co-working space, it was hard not to hear something deeper.\nCedar Street just came out victorious in a multi-year saga with the city of\nLa Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge\n, winning the first successful builder\u2019s remedy case in\nCalifornia Superior Court\nfor its 80-unit mixed-use project at 600 Foothill Boulevard and setting a path for other developers to build.\nBut the fight may have left its scars, in time, stress and now soured relationships with some officials.\nStill, there was an enormous payoff. The Foothill project set new case law and is now viewed as a warning to municipalities that this isn\u2019t the time to mess around with the state\u2019s pro-housing goals. The La Ca\u00f1ada mayor at the time of the Foothill project settlements, Mike Davitt, referred questions to current Mayor Kim Bowman. Bowman declined to comment for this story.\nBy the time it won city council approval last year, the Cedar Street development ultimately had the backing of Gov.\nGavin Newsom\nand state Attorney General Rob Bonta, who have been focused in their pursuit of more housing.\nNow, Curtis, a 25-year La Ca\u00f1ada resident who once sat on the city council, is looking at draft plans of the project, excited to show off the designs as Cedar Street lines up capital and considers its building materials.\n\u201cNow, there\u2019s the will to enforce.\u201d\nJonathan Curtis, Cedar Street Partners\n\u201cIf you were to look back during the time I was on the council and housing elements were a requirement under the state, the [California Department of Housing and Community Development, or HCD] and others didn\u2019t have the tools to enforce it, and there wasn\u2019t the will to enforce it,\u201d Curtis said.\n\u201cNow, there\u2019s the will to enforce.\u201d\nSpurred by a governor who wants action on housing development, builder\u2019s remedy project proposals have surged in the past few years. But getting a project through the legal system isn\u2019t easy, which is why the Cedar Street win matters so much.\nCurtis\u2019s \u201clong way down\u201d is apt, since the story starts in 1969, when California required cities and counties to map out long-term housing plans for residents at various income levels. Known as housing elements, these plans are part of local governments\u2019 general plans and get updated either every five or eight years; the HCD must approve them.\nThe period when a housing element is awaiting certification is especially filled with possibility for developers. Until a plan has approval, developers can bypass local zoning laws and file what\u2019s known as a builder\u2019s remedy project application. This \u201cremedy\u201d has been possible since 1990 but was rarely used until recently.\nThough discord among developers, local governments and residents over control of local land-use decisions continues, the Cedar Street win is a clear sign of California\u2019s direction: The state can dictate local development and land use.\nThe rest of the nation, grappling with a housing shortage, is watching how this will play out.\nB\nuilding on\nt\nheir own terms\nThink of the parties to housing element plans as three legs on a stool: developers, residents and city councils.\nAt various points, any of their perspectives could be considered right in a theoretical argument. But under Newsom, the winning position is whichever gets moving on housing starts.\nThe case law set with the Cedar Street win crystallizes that point. In the event housing law and the interpretation of builder\u2019s remedy wasn\u2019t clear, Bonta made sure to attach the Foothill project court decision to a June legal alert sent to all 539 jurisdictions in the state.\nThis reality has made its way to local lawmakers.\n\u201cThe production of housing is very important to HCD,\u201d Bryan Swanson, community development director in Saratoga, said in November. He was advising the city council in the Santa Clara County city to accept a memorandum of understanding with a developer called City Connect Real Estate Development. The state approved Saratoga\u2019s housing element in July 2024, with the plan, good through 2031, identifying a need for 1,712 additional homes. In the time before the housing element\u2019s approval, developers clamored to get their builder\u2019s remedy applications in, and the city faced more than 20 proposed projects.\nThe agreement Swanson suggested had to do with a project known as Vineyard One. The proposed idea was to take the unit count from 231 to 64. In exchange for the approval, City Connect would eventually pull its builder\u2019s remedy application.\nCouncil members wanted to know whether the smaller unit count could lead to a decertification of the city\u2019s housing element.\nSwanson explained that the 64-unit proposal would be in compliance; approving it was the \u201cfastest way to get to the end zone,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cThey want to see units entitled.\u201d\nA different approach was taken in Yorba Linda, the north Orange County birthplace of Richard Nixon, where horseback riders can be seen on more than 100 miles of trails.\nIn 2024, the residents of Yorba Linda voted on zoning changes called Measure JJ before the city\u2019s housing element was certified by the state. The city council wanted locals to embrace the overarching plan so they felt like they had a say in what was ultimately developed. At the same time, the measure, which passed with over 90 percent of the vote, let the council fulfill state requirements. The city, which did not respond to requests for comment, essentially headed off any public backlash to increased density or the possibility of a builder\u2019s remedy project by embracing development on its own terms.\nW\nhat remedy?\nNot every municipality has found such a win-win-win.\nHuntington Beach\nhas fought with the state over the constitutionality of a housing element in so-called charter cities, even though the city doesn\u2019t have a specific builder\u2019s remedy project it\u2019s trying to fight.\nIn December, the California Supreme Court refused to review a lower court decision on whether Huntington Beach\u2019s status as a charter city offered it a loophole to bypass the need for a housing element. The decision kicked the case back to San Diego Superior Court, with a judge telling the city to have its housing element done in 120 days.\nNewsom seized on the win, accusing the city of \u201cpathetic NIMBY behavior.\u201d\nIn the coastal Orange County city of\nNewport Beach\n, residents want to reduce the overall unit count of their state-approved housing element, even if it puts them out of compliance.\n\u201cWe want to honor what the state is doing. We\u2019re all pulling on the same oar, so we\u2019re not trying to be a rogue city at all.\u201d\nMarshall Duffield, Newport Beach Stewardship Association and former Newport Beach mayor\nThe current plan requires that Newport Beach add more than 8,000 units by 2030, which the state approved in October 2022 after several rounds of edits with the housing department.\nBut residents cried foul over the plan, arguing it went against the voter-approved Greenlight Initiative of 2000, which requires a referendum on any major land use or zoning decision.\nThe issue will now go on November\u2019s ballot as the Responsible Housing Initiative, which would reduce future housing requirements to less than 3,000 units.\nIt took about a week to gather enough signatures to get the initiative on the ballot, said Marshall \u201cDuffy\u201d Duffield, a member of the Newport Beach Stewardship Association and a former Newport Beach mayor. If shopping center and other property managers had allowed signature collectors on site, he thinks it could have been done faster.\nPassing the initiative would help the city avoid builder\u2019s remedy applications, Duffield argued, though it\u2019s unclear if the change would lead to the city falling out of compliance since it has an approved housing element. The city and HCD did not respond to an inquiry on the matter.\nThe initiative would give the community one thing it wants: less congestion. On a Thursday in January, Duffield was running late to his office thanks to traffic on two miles of Pacific Coast Highway. The congestion is an example of the lack of infrastructure, Duffield pointed out. With roads like this now, how could the city bring in more residents?\nStill, he concedes on the larger goal.\n\u201cWe want to honor what the state is doing,\u201d Duffield said. \u201cWe\u2019re all pulling on the same oar, so we\u2019re not trying to be a rogue city at all.\u201d\nAvoiding the fight sounds like a smart strategy to Curtis.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of ill feelings,\u201d Curtis said, reflecting on the past few years. \u201cIt\u2019s been difficult but hopefully it\u2019s making a positive dent in the housing crisis and, bottom line, the economy.\u201d",

        "content": "After a record December, Manhattan\u2019s office market hit a seasonal slowdown in January.\nManhattan\u2019s leasing activity totaled almost 3.7 million square feet, down nearly 30 percent from December but a slight increase year over year, according to a new Colliers report. The drop was not surprising, as January declines occurred in six of the past ten years, and December posted the\nhighest monthly leasing volume since 2019\n, per Colliers.\nMidtown nabbed the top two deals, led by law firm Gibson Dunn\u2019s 362,000-square-foot renewal at Irvine Company\u2019s MetLife Building. Landlord BXP scored the second-largest deal, Global insurance and investment firm C.V. Starr\u2019s\n274,000-square-foot new lease\nat 343 Madison Avenue, per Colliers. The third-largest was Burlington Stores\u2019 206,000-square-foot extension and expansion at Empire State Realty Trust\u2019s\n1400 Broadway\nin Midtown South.\nThe availability rate tightened to 13.5 percent, marking the 23rd consecutive month of stable or decreasing supply. Sublet supply fell for the 16th straight month to 10.7 million square feet, a 38 percent year-over-year decrease and the lowest since September 2019. Asking rents averaged $77 per square foot, up about 5 percent year over year, but still about 3 percent below March 2020.\nMidtown captured 47 percent of the month\u2019s activity as availability crept almost back to March 2020 levels, when it was only 7.7 percent lower. Midtown South followed a similar trend, with large deals helping push leasing activity almost 73 percent above the ten-year average. Despite leasing lagging, even Downtown sublet space tightened to its lowest point since mid-2020, while rents rose to levels not seen since February 2021, per Colliers.\nManhattan was coming off a hot quarter, posting its strongest results since before the pandemic. Leasing activity jumped more than 25 percent quarter over quarter at the end of last year.\n",

        "content": "Henry Elghanayan\u2019s Rockrose Development is back to pick up what it left behind at Long Island College Hospital\u2019s former Cobble Hill site.\nRockrose is in contract to buy a Brooklyn city block from an entity tied to LICH and SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, PincusCo\nreported\n. The $100 million contract is subject to approval from the New York State Attorney General\u2019s office, due to the nonprofit involved.\nThe 258,000-square-foot building stretches across four parcels: 363 Hicks Street, 365 Hicks Street, 97 Amity Street and 340 Henry Street. It last traded hands in 2011 for $44.3 million, though the city valued it at $120.7 million in 2022.\nA representative from SUNY Downstate did not immediately respond to a request for comment from\nThe Real\nDeal\n. Rockrose could not be reached.\nLess than two years ago, Rockrose bought 91-95 Pacific Street \u2014 just north of the latest pending acquisition \u2014 from Madison Realty Capital\nfor $65 million\n. Previous plans at the site called for a condominium project, which Rockrose did not confirm would be in the offing.\nThere\u2019s been plenty of controversy around the larger LICH holding.\nFortis Property Group\nsold\nthe Pacific Street site, along with 350 Hicks Street, to Madison Realty in October 2022 to avoid foreclosure. Fortis planned to build two condo buildings with a total of 150 units, most of which would be at the Pacific Street site.\nMadison, the project\u2019s lender, initiated a UCC foreclosure on the equity interests in the sites after Fortis defaulted on $47.7 million in debt, but the parties reached a settlement; Madison held onto the Hicks Street site for the time being, but it\u2019s unclear if it\u2019s changed hands since.\nFortis bought the former hospital campus from the State University of New York\nin 2015 for $240 million\nafter state officials voted to close the hospital, which had been operating for more than 150 years.\nFortis later abandoned plans to rezone the site after failing to come to terms with then-City Council member Brad Lander, who sought robust affordable housing, a school and other community benefits. The developer instead pursued a plan to build a smaller, market-rate project that required no political approval.\nSubsequently, Fortis and SUNY\naccused\neach other of failing to fulfill their obligations under the 2015 sale. The university system sued Fortis for failing to close on the second phase of the deal. Fortis, in response, said SUNY should have covered costs associated with construction delays, which the developer blamed for holding up 2 River Park.\nThere are still two active court cases related to the dispute, though they aren\u2019t expected to hold up the sale.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Michael Shvo\u2019s Mandarin Oriental Residences\nare getting a new sales team \u2014 and new pricing.\nA Serhant team led by Peter Zaitzeff and Glenn Davis is taking over sales at the building in the latest bid to breathe life back into the 65-unit project, which has sold just about one-third of its condos since launching in 2021.\nThe newly priced units feature steep discounts. A two-bedroom is now listed for just $5.3 million, down more than 12 percent from its original asking price, while a one-bedroom unit spanning over 1,000 square feet is asking $4.25 million, after it was priced at almost $6 million in the property\u2019s offering plan.\n\u201cWe want to trade those things close to where we listed them, and I think we can, because we reduced significantly,\u201d Zaitzeff said of the new pricing.\nA Douglas Elliman team led by Jade Chan and Alexander Boriskin had previously overseen sales at the building.\nThe latest sales revamp comes\nafter it was reported last fall\nthat Shvo and other investors, including Deutsche Finance America and German pension fund Bayerische Versorgungskammer, hired Eastdil Secured to try and unload the unsold condos in a bulk deal.\nZaitzeff said that while there\u2019s always the opportunity for a bulk sale of the remaining units, \u201cthe goal here is to sell these to the general public.\u201d\nIn September 2024, the project\u2019s developers secured a\n$120 million inventory loan\nfrom Northwind Group for the building\u2019s unsold condos. At the time, just 15 condos had sold at the project, which had a projected sellout of $340 million. The building still has 45 units left to sell.\nRepresentatives for Shvo and DFA did not respond to requests for comment. Northwind CEO Ran Eliasaf said the new sales team was brought in to \u201cexecute on the business plan.\u201d\nShvo and his partners bought what was\nformerly known as the Gucci building\nfor $135 million in 2018, and converted the office portion of the building into condos while adding five floors of residences. The condo is the first residential-only property managed by Mandarin Oriental on the East Coast, and gives residents access to a private restaurant and bar run by Daniel Boulud.\nIn 2024, two buyers alleged the finishes in their $6 million one-bedroom condo fell short of the agreed-upon plans in a lawsuit filed in New York. A judge dismissed Shvo as an individual defendant. The case is still pending.\nWhile Shvo tries to make good on his investment at 685 Fifth, the rest of his portfolio remains in turmoil.\nShvo sold the Raleigh Rosewood Residences, a condo and hotel project in Miami Beach, for\n$270 million\nin October to Nahla Capital, despite his efforts to match their offer.\u00a0 The new owners\ntapped Compass\nto lead sales and marketing at the project.\nHe also defaulted on a $200 million loan at the\nMandarin Oriental in Beverly Hills\n, leading to a sale-in-lieu-of-foreclosure, and is entangled in a messy lawsuit with Core Club, which sued him in November and\naccused him\nof being involved in a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) conspiracy.\nMost recently, rumors have swirled that Shvo is in line to lose the\nTransamerica Pyramid\n, one of the eye-catching pieces of the San Francisco skyline. A spokesperson for Shvo told\nThe Real Deal\nthose rumors are \u201cfalse.\u201d\nThe building is home to a bright spot for Shvo, after landing what the developer has claimed is a West Coast rent record. An anonymous tenant agreed to pay $300 per square foot for approximately 4,000 square feet on the building\u2019s 44th floor, the San Francisco Chronicle reported earlier this month. The property was 85 percent leased as of December.\n",

        "content": "Some of Manhattan\u2019s marquee properties are reeling in marquee loans. From rent-stabilized megacomplexes and trophy office condos to supertall towers and converted office blocks, lenders wrote nine-figure (and one ten-figure) checks to refinance, reset or reposition some of the city\u2019s most closely watched properties. December\u2019s top deals spanned neighborhoods and property types, but all involved high-profile buildings with well-capitalized owners.\nAll told, lenders on the five largest deals in Manhattan parted ways with almost $5.6 billion.\nHere are more details.\nStuy Town shuffle | $3.15B | Stuyvesant Town\nWells Fargo\nprovided a $3.15 billion loan to refinance Blackstone\u2019s Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village as a $3 billion debt from Fannie Mae backing Manhattan\u2019s largest apartment complex was nearing maturity. Since purchasing the complex alongside a Canadian pension fund for $5.5 billion in 2015, Blackstone has invested $460 million into the property. That includes renovations, expansions and the installation of 9,600 solar panels. All of the 11,250 units are rent-stabilized.\nConversion cash-in | $835M | Financial District\nApollo and GIC\nprovided an $835 million loan to refinance 25 Water Street, the 1,320-unit\noffice-to-residential conversion\nby GFP Real Estate, Metro Loft and Rockwood Capital. The fresh financing replaced\na $536 million loan\nfrom Michael Dell\u2019s MSD Partners and Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance. At the time in 2022, the loan was the largest for an office-to-residential conversion in United States history. Leasing began at the former 1.1 million-square-foot office property \u2014 dubbed SoMA for South Manhattan \u2014 in the last days of January 2025 and move-ins began the following month.\nSupertall haul | $640M | Midtown\nCarlyle Group\nprovided a $640 million condo inventory loan for Rabina\u2019s supertall at 520 Fifth Avenue. The fresh financing replaces a $540 million construction loan from Bank OZK and Carlyle\u2019s Global Credit business as the mixed-use tower transitions to leasing and sales. The 1,000-foot project located near the Empire State Building now stands as the tallest tower on Fifth Avenue in that stretch of Midtown. The property combines 25 floors of offices and 100 luxury condominiums.\nCondo sales\nlaunched in April 2024 and the building\u2019s private club, Moss, opened in November and the offices are open for tenant move-ins.\nKKR ca-ching | $500M | Hudson Yards\nBank of America\nprovided a $500 million loan to KKR for two office condominiums at 30 Hudson Yards. The fresh financing replaced a $490 million loan from Deutsche Bank. KKR purchased the top 10 office floors of the building, spanning about 343,000 square feet, in 2015 and moved its corporate offices there. It later inked a\n220,000-square-foot lease\nfor space vacated by Facebook parent company Meta Platforms. The company also\nbought a majority stake\nin the observation deck \u2013 the tallest outdoor deck in the Western hemisphere \u2013 for more than $500 million in 2021.\nRetail refi | $450M | Midtown\nCredit Agricole\nprovided a $450 million loan for the retail portion of 715-717 Fifth Avenue after Kering sold a 60 percent stake in the property to private equity firm Ardian. Kering bought the 115,000-square-foot property about two years ago from Jeff Sutton and SL Green\nfor $963 million\n. The parent company of Gucci, Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen scored $690 million in proceeds in the deal, which valued the property at $900 million. Kering has been looking to offload properties to improve its balance sheet after its debt soared to approximately $12 billion at the end of 2024.\n",

        "content": "A unit at\nCentral Park Tower\nscored the priciest contract in Manhattan last week, just beating out a unit at another building by Gary Barnett\u2019s firm at 50 West 66th Street, according to Olshan Realty.\nUnit 82E at Central Park Tower had a last asking price of $26.7 million, which was reduced from $34.5 million, the price included in the property\u2019s offering plan. Spanning almost 4,300 square feet, the apartment features four bedrooms and four full bathrooms. Nearly all of the floor-to-ceiling windows have views of the park.\nThe tower has over 50,000 square feet of amenities, including indoor and outdoor pools, a fitness center and a 100th-floor club room that comes with a ballroom, bar, dining and cigar lounge.\nAn in-house Extell team led by Gabriele Tonini and Tim Rizzo is heading sales, alongside a team from Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group helmed by Kane Manera and Janet Wang.\nThe 1,550-foot-tall building, marketed as the tallest residential building in the world, has seen a number of units close after steep discounts. Another unit on the building\u2019s E line, 84E, closed over two years ago for $25 million, according to Olshan.\nA\n116th full-floor\nunit closed for $46 million last year, down $7 million from its last asking price and almost $20 million from its initial price listed in the developer\u2019s offering plan. Another unit spanning the entire 121st floor closed for $47.5 million in November after dropping its asking price to\n$55 million\nfrom the more than $65 million listed in the offering plan.\nThe second most expensive contract signed last week went to Unit 43S at\n50 West 66th\n, another Extell tower. The home was asking almost $24 million.\nThe four-bedroom, four-bathroom condo spans roughly 3,500 square feet. Its living room has ceilings stretching over 14 feet and faces Central Park. Prices at the 70-story building have tended to go the other way compared to Central Park Tower; unit 43S originally asked just over $22 million in the building\u2019s original offering plan.\nAn in-house team from Extell Marketing Group, a team from Douglas Elliman led by Janice Chang and Timothy Hsu and a team from Corcoran led by Beth Benalloul and Hilary Landis are overseeing sales at the building. Chang brought the buyer for the deal at unit 43S.\nExtell has also created a number of supersized units, which have scored some of the priciest sales in the building, like\nUnit 41E\n, a 7,000-square-foot, six-bedroom apartment that closed for over $46 million in December.\nThe building includes 50,000 square feet of amenities, including indoor and outdoor pools, squash, basketball and pickleball courts and a porte-cochere entrance.\nLast week saw 33 contracts signed in Manhattan for homes asking at least $4 million, up from\n23 in the previous period\n. Twenty-five condos snagged deals, along with five co-ops, one cond-op and three townhouses.\nThe January luxury market in Manhattan ended roughly in line with last year. There were 103 contracts signed for $885 million this year, compared to 96 contracts signed for $896 million last year.\n",

        "content": "Flagstar Bank eked out its first\nprofitable quarter\nsince narrowly avoiding collapse in 2024, a milestone driven by aggressive cuts to its multifamily and commercial real estate loan book.\nThe lender reported $21 million in net income in the fourth quarter, swinging from a $45 million loss the prior quarter, according to an earnings report posted Friday. For all of last year, Flagstar still lost $177 million, but that was a sharp improvement from its roughly $1 billion loss the year before, Bisnow\nreported\n.\nWall Street wasn\u2019t expecting the comeback quite so soon; Flagstar posted $557 million in quarterly revenue, beating consensus estimates by about 4 percent, while earnings per share came in at 5 cents, ahead of projections. The stock nonetheless slipped about 1 percent midday Friday, a sign investors remain wary of what\u2019s left on the balance sheet.\nThat caution isn\u2019t unfounded. Flagstar still has about $3 billion in troubled loans and remains deeply entangled in New York City\u2019s rent-stabilized housing market, long a core business line for New York Community Bancorp and Signature Bank before both ran aground.\nAt the end of 2023, Flagstar \u2014 built on the husk of NYCB \u2014 held $50.6 billion in commercial real estate loans. By the end of last year, that figure had fallen to $38.3 billion. In the fourth quarter, Flagstar shed $2.3 billion of CRE exposure, including $1.5 billion tied to multifamily.\nSince early 2024, the bank has reviewed 97 percent of its New York City rent-regulated loan book, which totals $14.6 billion today. More than $9 billion is backed by buildings where at least half the units are regulated. Nonaccrual loans in that portfolio stand at $2 billion.\nFlagstar has logged $1.7 billion in payoffs and $375 million in charge-offs tied to those loans, while boosting its allowance for credit losses to 5.6 percent.\nOne particularly painful example of the rent-stabilized market\u2019s impact was a $564 million loan tied to more than 5,000 rent-stabilized apartments formerly owned by Pinnacle Group. The properties were sold in a bankruptcy auction, costing the bank a roughly $113 million write-down.\nThe political backdrop remains a wild card. Mayor Zohran Mamdani pledged to freeze rents for stabilized units, a move that would further strain landlords\u2019 ability to service debt. Flagstar executives said they\u2019re modeling scenarios with flat rents and rising expenses and closely scrutinizing borrowers with outstanding violations.\nStill, management signaled it isn\u2019t abandoning commercial real estate altogether. As it works through legacy New York exposure, Flagstar plans to selectively ramp up originations in markets like Michigan, California and Florida.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The deal is expected to close in the spring, but will need court approval.\nThe contracted buyers are the Rockefeller Group and Atlas Capital Group, which are paying $96 million for the property. They plan to preserve the church and rectory, but convert other parts of the facility into housing.\nThe developers will take advantage of the 485x tax abatement program, which mandates 25 percent of the units built to be affordable. The amount of units set to be developed, however, was not disclosed. The project is also expected to have residential amenities and retail space.\nThis is just the latest example of the church shrinking its portfolio, partially in an effort to compensate victims of abuse from the clergy; in December, Cardinal Timothy Dolan told parishioners that the church would keep liquidating real estate to fill a widening financial hole tied to settlements.\nAt that time, the Archdiocese\nagreed to sell\nthe ground lease under the Lotte New York Palace for $490 million to the luxury hotel operator.\nIn July, the church unloaded its longtime headquarters at 1011 First Avenue to Vanbarton Group for $103 million; Vanbarton plans to\nconvert\nthe office tower to residential.\nAn Archdiocese spokesperson said the 1011 First Avenue proceeds could also be routed toward the global settlement as the Church continues to mine its portfolio to meet obligations.\nAtlas Capital is off to a busy start this year, having recently\npurchased\nthe 13-story, 130-unit former \u201cRed Square\u201d multifamily rental building at 250 East Houston Street for $112 million from Dermot Company and Rockwood Capital.\nMeanwhile, the Rockefeller Group recently\nexpanded\ninto the Pacific Northwest with the acquisition of a new 187,000-square-foot warehouse.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "University of Miami booster John Ruiz listed his waterfront Gables Estates mansion for $175 million, marking the second most expensive listing in Miami-Dade.\nRuiz, founder and CEO of Coral Gables-based MSP Recovery,\npaid $46 million\nfor the 2.2-acre property at 600-620 Arvida Parkway in 2020. He\u2019s now looking to sell it for nearly four times that price.\nThe nearly 15,000-square-foot estate includes 10 bedrooms, 14 bathrooms and two half-baths, a two-bedroom guest house, staff quarters, a gym, spa, salon, speakeasy lounge, a wine cellar, an eight-car garage, a pool and dock. It also has a panic room and backup generators, according to the listing.\nThe tropical modern mansion was built in 2017 and expanded in 2022, records show. It was designed by architect Cesar Molina.\nThe property, which includes 335 feet of water frontage, is on the market with Mocca Realty\u2019s Alex Pirez, who also brokered the previous sale.\nRuiz\u2019s insurance claims company was the target of a three-year Securities and Exchange Commission investigation over issues that included the company\u2019s projected financial results to investors. The\nMiami Herald\nreported in late September that the SEC completed its investigation and it did not plan to pursue legal action.\nRuiz has also spent millions of dollars endorsing University of Miami student athletes. In 2021, Ruiz acquired the Cigarette Racing Team brand.\nHis Gables Estates property marks the fifth most expensive listing in Florida, according to\nRealtor.com\n.\nGables Estates is one of the waterfront neighborhoods in Miami that has recently benefitted from a boom in ultra-luxury sales.\nLast year, Pirez, a luxury homebuilder, sold his waterfront Gables Estates mansion at 340 Leucadendra Drive\nfor $55 million\n. That deal marked a record for home sales in Coral Gables.\nBillionaire businessman Jorge Mas recently purchased a mansion in the same gated community, on Casuarina Concourse,\nfor $75 million\n, a source previously told\nThe Real Deal.\n",

        "content": "Developers in Los Angeles have been some of the most active in erecting affordable housing across the country in the post-pandemic years.\nLos Angeles\nranked\nseventh nationwide for affordable housing between 2020 and 2024, Westside Today reported, citing a new report from RentCafe. A total of 9,406 income-restricted apartments were completed in Los Angeles in the post-Covid period, accounting for approximately 20.5 percent of all apartment construction in the L.A. metro area in those years.\nOf the country\u2019s 20 largest affordable housing markets, Los Angeles has one of the highest proportions of income-restricted units to overall new construction, according to RentCafe\u2019s analysis. About one-third of new apartment development in New York City and\nSan Francisco was for affordable units\n; by contrast, about 5 percent of new construction in Dallas consists of income-restricted housing. Seattle\nclaimed\nthe top spot with 14,290 new affordable units constructed between 2020 and 2024.\nAffordable housing development has been rapidly picking up speed in recent years, per the RentCafe report. Between 2020 and 2024, the number of affordable units completed represented a 79.5 percent increase compared to the previous five-year period between 2015 and 2019.\nExecutive Directive 1\n, enacted by Mayor Karen Bass in late 2022, has helped kick affordable housing development into high gear. The directive expedites approvals for\n100 percent affordable projects\nas developers who apply to build fully affordable developments can skip the lengthy public hearings process and avoid city council votes, cutting down approval timelines from nine months to a few weeks in most cases, according to the mayor\u2019s office.\nDevelopers have taken note as they increasingly opt to build affordable housing instead of market rate.\n\u201cMarket-rate housing [construction] has been essentially canceled at this point,\u201d Chris Aiello, founding partner at Six Peak Capital, which has been among the firms increasingly pursuing affordable housing, told\nCoStar\n. \u201cVirtually no land makes sense from an investment perspective to build market rate.\u201d\n\u201cED1 is the only reason we came out here,\u201d Passo principal Daniel Glimcher\ntold\nthe Wall Street Journal. \u201cMarket-rate multifamily just really doesn\u2019t pencil out in L.A.\u201d\nSince\nED1\u2019s implementation\n, developers have submitted proposals for 35,000 units under ED1 and secured approvals for approximately 29,000 of those units as of last August. That far outdoes the number of affordable housing submissions from 2020 to 2022 as well as the 17,556 units total housing units approved in L.A. during the last fiscal year.\nThe state of California is getting behind the effort to build more income-restricted housing. Last month, the California Strategic Growth Council approved $866 million in grant funding for\naffordable housing projects\nacross the state, including more than $182 million for efforts in the Los Angeles area.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The developer plans to turn the existing building, spanning more than 480,000 square feet, into 391 residential units.\nShomof acquired the property, known as Landmark Square, last fall for $50 million,\nThe Real Deal previously reported\n. A Manulife Financial Corporation affiliate sold the property at a steep discount, having purchased the offices in 2013 from Brookfield Properties for $135.5 million.\nThe structure is one of downtown Long Beach\u2019s newer and taller office buildings. Adaptive reuse has made more of an impact in downtown L.A. than downtown Long Beach, but Ocean Boulevard has seen a number of historic buildings converted into new uses in recent years.\nNear 111 West Ocean Boulevard at 200 West Ocean Boulevard, a high-rise built in the 1960s reopened as housing in 2023, according to Urbanize. The Breakers Building at 210 East Ocean Boulevard made its debut as the\nFremont Breakers Long Beach hotel\nin 2024. The Ocean Center Building at 110 West Ocean Boulevard, across the street from Shomoff\u2019s latest office-to-residential pursuit, completed its housing transition and opened to tenants in 2023.\nMore housing\nadaptive reuse projects\nare on the way. At 400 Oceangate, a 14-story office building is slated for conversion into housing. The 120-year-old First National Bank Building at 115 Pine Avenue, around the corner from 111 West Ocean Boulevard, is also set for residential units, according to Urbanize.\nShomof\u2019s office purchase in Long Beach is his latest in the Greater Los Angeles area as the developer appears poised for more adaptive reuse endeavors. A year ago, Shomof\npurchased\n101 North Brand Boulevard in Glendale for $58.5 million from Beacon Capital Partners, which bought the property in 2016 for $128.5 million. In 2024, he bought 617 West 7th Street in downtown Los Angeles\u2019 Financial District\nfrom Swig Company\nfor $20.5 million \u2014 nearly half off from its price over a decade prior.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Buyers seeking reprieve from surging prices of wealthy North Shore lakefront communities can find it just to the west in Northfield, where residential real estate is having its moment.\nLocated just west of Winnetka, Northfield was the site of the fifth- and sixth-most expensive home sales in Cook County last month, each bringing in more than $3 million.\nThe deals are among the seven highest Northfield home sales in the last five years, according to listing services, and signal a shift in buyer interest as prices in nearby Winnetka\nreach unprecedented levels\n, said Baird &amp; Warner agent Ben Fisher, who closed the larger of the two transactions. He said buyers are looking to Northfield for more space and amenities while staying close to the lake and in the same school district.\n\u201cWhen you look at Northfield, you get a bigger house, a bigger lot, New Trier Schools,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cAnd people have finally opened their eyes up to this incredible small town of not even 6,000 people.\u201d\nA sprawling 21,000-square-foot home in Northfield sold for nearly $3.6 million on Jan. 5, the fifth-priciest sale in Cook County last month. The mansion at 2202 Martin Lane was designed and built by a real estate developer in 2013, said Fisher, who represented the buyer on the deal. Property records show commercial developer Stanislaw Pluta was the seller, while Fisher wouldn\u2019t identify his client and public documents of the sale aren\u2019t yet public.\n\u201cIt is really over the top because it was built for a guy who builds for a living,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cSo there\u2019s a ton of stone, almost commercial systems in terms of the electrical, the plumbing. The bones are incredible.\u201d\nLukas Pluta with Wilmot Realty represented the seller.\nA modern transitional home at 2064 Norfork Road in Northfield brought in $3.5 million on Jan. 14, the sixth-priciest sale in Cook County last month. Built in 2020, the home is 5,380 square feet and has six bedrooms and five bathrooms. @properties broker\nJena Radnay\nand Baird &amp; Warner\u2019s Richard Murawski represented the sellers.\nThe biggest listed sale in Northfield in the last five years was $5 million for a 7,000-square-foot home on Old Farm Road, according to listing data.\nThe comparison between Northfield and Winnetka is borne out in the January sales data: the priciest home sale in the latter was a non-lakefront home at 861 Bell Lane, which sold for $3.35 million. The 7,218-square-foot house brought in $464 per square foot, while the Martin Lane mansion in Northfield sold for $170 per square foot.\nAcross Cook County\n, there were 163 sales over $1 million in January, compared to 193 in January 2025, according to data gathered from Redfin and\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nmost recent Cook County broker ranking. Outside Chicago, Wilmette and Glenview led the pack in home sales over $1 million, with nine sales each in January.\nStill, the highest end of the luxury market was relatively quiet last month. Only one home broke the $5 million mark, a five-story greystone at 1540 N Dearborn Parkway in Chicago that brought in $5.1 million on Jan. 12.\nThe five-bedroom, eight bathroom, 7,600-square-foot home features a central spiral staircase, outdoor terraces and a two-car garage, according to listing services.\nBrad Lippitz\nand Brittany Shapiro of Compass represented the seller, while Rubina Bokhari represented the buyer.\nThe sellers were Ferdinand and Bernadette Korndorf, according to public records. Details on the buyer\u2019s identity are not yet available.\nThe second-priciest trade was a massive, 14,600-square-foot mansion at\n6655 Lee Court in Burr Ridge\n, which sold for just over $4 million. The most expensive sale in Burr Ridge since 2024, the home was once owned by former NBA player Eddy Curry before he lost it through foreclosure. The home sits on a secluded cul-de-sac on a spacious one-acre lot. Compass\u2019 Rafael Murillo represented the buyers, while Ginny Stewart and Paige Kelly of Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty represented the sellers.\nOral surgeon Louis Korompilas was the seller and Sadia Rizwan was the buyer, according to property records.\n",

Osso secured a $71 million loan originated by JLL Real Estate Capital and sold it off on the commercial mortgage-backed securities market, according to Will County records and CMBS tracking firm Morningstar Credit. John declined to comment on the sale.\nThe property was first listed in July. JLL\u2019s Mark Stern brokered the deal on behalf of the seller.\nStern declined to comment on the sale, but said the market in general performed well in 2025 and is on track to improve in 2026. Listings often receive several offers, and institutional investors have started to\ncome off of the sidelines\n, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since everyone was focused on Chicago and the Midwest in particular,\u201d Stern said.\nOther recently closed suburban multifamily deals include the sales of The Arrowhead Apartments in Arlington Heights, The Fox Pointe Apartments in Aurora and The Carriage Creek Apartments in Richton Park, public records show.\nThe flurry of activity indicates that 2026 may be\nanother busy year for Chicago\u2019s suburban multifamily market.\nDuring the first three quarters of 2025, Interra recorded 155 apartment building sales between $1 million and $50 million, compared with 115 deals in the same time price range during the same period in 2024.\nThe Chicago multifamily market in general performed well in 2025 due to a low supply of new units and steady job growth. But the\nsuburbs have outperformed the city\nbecause investors perceive them as having more predictable political and property tax atmospheres.\nThe Arrowhead Apartments, Arlington Heights\nIn Arlington Heights, where speculation about a new Chicago Bears Stadium continues to circulate, the Hispanic Housing Development Corporation sold the Arrowhead Apartments to Artisan Capital Group, records show. Both firms are based in Chicago.\nArtisan, led by Ryan Cahalan and Michael Perry, bought the 200-unit complex for $31.4 million or about $157,000 per unit. Public records do not yet show a new mortgage recorded against the property.\nThe HHDC, led by Tony Hernandez, originally bought the Arrowhead Apartments at 1950 Cambridge Court for $23.6 million in 2018 with a $18.8 million mortgage from First America Bank, according to Cook County records.\nRepresentatives of Artisan Capital and the HHDC did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe Fox Pointe Apartments, Aurora\nAbout 40 miles west of Chicago, a Miami-based investment firm bought a 248-unit apartment complex known as The Fox Pointe Apartments at 2074 Fox Point Circle in Aurora.\nPalatine Capital Partners, led by Alex Hurst, paid $40.1 million for the property, or about $162,000 per unit.\nThe seller, Jeb Scherb\u2019s Chicago-based Ameritus, originally bought the apartment community in 2020 for $25 million. It secured a $17.9 million mortgage that was originated by Grandbridge Real Estate Capital and sold off on the CMBS market, according to Kane County records and CMBS tracking firm Morningstar Credit.\nRepresentatives of Ameritus and Palatine Capital Partners did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe Carriage Creek Apartments, Richton Park\nA longtime owner cashed in on the Carriage Creek Apartments by selling them for $11.9 million to\nChicago-based Bender Companies\n. The sale of the 226-unit tower at 22400 Butterfield Road in the south suburb of Richton Park came out to about $53,000 per unit.\nIt\u2019s unclear how long the seller, local investor Daniel Kotcher, owned the complex, but he took out a $7.5 million mortgage against the property in 2013, records show.\nKotcher could not be reached for comment, and representatives of Bender Companies did not respond to requests for comment.\nMarcus &amp; Millichaps\u2019 Ryan D. Engle and Andrean Angelov represented the buyer and the seller in the deal.",

        "content": "The first FDIC-insured bank failure of 2026 slipped by with little fanfare late Friday, but court records suggest a long-simmering real estate loan exposure may have played a key role.\nIllinois regulators seized Chicago-based Metropolitan Capital Bank &amp; Trust, which held about $261 million in assets, and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver, Bisnow\nreported\n. FDIC transferred all deposits and most assets to Detroit-based First Independence Bank, which plans to reopen Metropolitan\u2019s lone\nRiver North\nbranch at 9 East Ontario Street under its own banner. It was the largest bank failure in Illinois since 2017.\nRegulators have not publicly identified the cause of the collapse, and FDIC has yet to release a post-seizure analysis. But a review by the outlet of court filings and enforcement actions points to a problematic commercial real estate loan tied to the largest default in the federal government\u2019s\nskilled nursing facility lending program\n.\nMetropolitan held a $4.5 million loan originated in 2014 to entities controlled by Chicago real estate investor,\nRabbi Zvi Feiner\n. The debt helped restructure obligations across 13 Rosewood Care Centers facilities in the Midwest and sat junior to a $146 million HUD-insured mortgage. That senior loan ultimately defaulted, and the Department of Justice later charged Feiner with running a\nPonzi scheme\n.\nAs Rosewood\u2019s finances deteriorated, Metropolitan modified its loan five times between 2014 and 2017, extending repayment terms without demanding additional collateral, court records show. In the fifth modification, the bank accepted collateral already pledged elsewhere. An Illinois appellate court ruled in 2020 that while Feiner made material misrepresentations, Metropolitan failed to conduct basic due diligence and was left with no enforceable claim.\nThe $4.5 million exposure loomed large for a bank of Metropolitan\u2019s size and drew regulatory scrutiny. In 2019, regulators imposed a consent order citing \u201cunsafe and unsound conditions,\u201d an impaired capital position and substandard lending practices, according to the publication. The order required management changes, higher capital levels and tighter controls.\nMetropolitan Capital was founded in 2005 by Michael Rose, former executive director of the Illinois Housing Development Authority. Rose departed the bank last July to become managing partner at Affinitas Capital.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A long-empty Super Kmart that once anchored a\nRound Lake Beach\nshopping center is heading for the wrecking ball, and Target is stepping in to revive the site.\nTarget Stores closed on the purchase of the former Super Kmart at 400 East Rollins Road at the Rollins Crossing shopping center in December and plans to demolish the roughly 190,000-square-foot building and replace it with a new Target, the company\nconfirmed\nto the Daily Herald. The old big-box store shuttered more than 12 years ago and has sat vacant ever since, with imprints of taken-down signs still lingering on the building\u2019s side.\nThe new Target is slated to span about 148,570 square feet. The retailer has applied for a demolition permit, though it has not released a\nconstruction timeline\nor opening date, according to the publication.\nThe company said in a statement that more details will come closer to opening.\nThe deal caps years of frustration with a property\nvillage officials\nincreasingly viewed as an eyesore. Mayor Scott Nickles, elected in 2021, said redeveloping the former Kmart was a top priority, the outlet reported. The village even explored buying the building itself after Kmart closed, but the owner wouldn\u2019t sell, Nickles said.\nAfter more than a decade of inactivity, the village initiated legal action to have the structure condemned. Target\u2019s purchase came before those proceedings concluded.\nThe site sits along busy Rollins Road near the village municipal complex and is part of a broader retail corridor that includes grocery stores, restaurants and entertainment uses. Village officials have described the former Kmart as the\ncornerstone\nof Rollins Crossing \u2014 and its vacancy as a drag on the center\u2019s potential.\nTarget\u2019s move fits with its broader expansion push. The retailer plans to open about 30 new stores this year and more than 300 by 2035, according to the company.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The Chicago Tribune\nreported\nthat the plan would bring a blend of for-sale housing and neighborhood retail to the corridor in what Predovich pegged as a $50 million to $60 million investment, according to materials presented to the Village Board this week.\nThe proposal centers on two three-story buildings fronting 159th Street, with about 30,000 square feet of retail on the ground floor and condos above, village planning and zoning director Christopher Gruba said. Each building would include 13 condos, ranging from roughly 1,250 square feet to 1,500 square feet with balconies, plus larger penthouses up to 1,800 square feet with outdoor terraces.\nBehind the mixed-use buildings, the plan calls for a gated enclave of 20 duplex buildings \u2014 40 homes total \u2014 set along an internal drive.\nPrices\nfor the duplexes could start in the upper $500,000s or $600,000s, Predovich said.\nNotably absent from the mix are\napartments\n, as Predovich made clear he isn\u2019t interested in rentals. Homer Glen residents and officials have\nhistorically pushed back\nagainst apartment development, according to the outlet.\nRetail could be spread across as many as 16 storefronts, Predovich said, with potential tenants including restaurants, boutiques and coffee shops. The development is designed to be walkable and function as a gathering place rather than a standalone subdivision. Homes would be built in brick with varied elevations and color palettes to avoid a \u201ccookie-cutter\u201d feel, the development team said.\nThe plan is still early. Trustees heard the concept at a committee meeting Wednesday, but no approvals were granted. The proposal must still go before the plan commission and ultimately return to the Village Board for a vote. It would also require the creation of a new zoning district, as Homer Glen doesn\u2019t currently have a classification tailored to mixed-use development of this type, Gruba said.\nSeveral village trustees said the project could appeal to longtime residents looking to downsize without leaving the village, while adding the kind of retail amenities the corridor lacks.\nMayor Christina Neitzke-Troike stressed that resident input will shape what happens next, calling the project a \u201cbig deal.\u201d The village will gather public feedback ahead of its Feb. 11 meeting.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

With\noffice construction slowing\nin the area, office users could soon run into a shortage of new, top-tier space in the Peninsula and Silicon Valley.\nRoblox\u2019s newest\noffices in San Mateo\nare one instance of a company doubling down on transit-oriented offices. The online gaming company expanded by 112,000 square feet at Bay Meadows in offices surrounded by housing, shops and Caltrain.\nNorth of San Mateo in Burlingame, fintech firm Upstart Holdings leased 54,000 square feet at the newly built 220 Park, a six-story office building near\nBurlingame\u2019s Caltrain station\n. CBRE\u2019s coworking company Industrious is also at 220 Park,\nsigning a lease last quarter\nfor 19,800 square feet.\nIn Redwood City, law firm Paul Hastings is planning to move into 45,000 square feet as the company doubles down on offices in transit-adjacent areas across the country, according to the Business Times. And in Sunnyvale,\nDatabricks\nhas continued its Bay Area expansion with three floors at Cityline\u2019s seven-story 250 West Washington Avenue, bringing its total footprint at the Cityline development near the Sunnyvale Caltrain station to 455,000 square feet.\nLast year, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed\nSenate Bill 79\n, which increased zoning in areas near transit stops, allowing developers to build residential structures between six and nine stories within a half-mile of bus and train stops. The goal with the legislation is ostensibly to incentivize developers to initiate new projects near those transportation connections.\nLandlords overall filled 17,674 square feet in the quarter, marking the second consecutive quarter of positive absorption when more space was leased than vacated. In total, office vacancy in the Peninsula rose to 19.2 percent in the fourth quarter, while asking rents dropped 5 percent quarter-over-quarter. The vacancy increase can be partially attributed to\nOracle\n\u2019s decision to vacate 294,000 square feet at its longtime Redwood City campus, per the Business Times.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A long-simmering debate over what to do with Dallas City Hall now includes a proposal from Ray Washburne to move local government operations into one of his downtown buildings.\nAt issue is the aging seven-story, 1 million-square-foot Brutalist building at 1500 Marilla Street and whether the city should\nspend nine figures\nto overhaul it or decamp to a new home, potentially unlocking one of the largest redevelopment sites in the urban core.\nA City Hall move\ncould clear the way for a mixed-use redevelopment tied to a new Dallas Mavericks arena, while keeping the building would mean doubling down on preservation and reinvestment, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe latest volley came via the Dallas Morning News editorial section, which launched a series dubbed \u201cSaving Downtown.\u201d The opening installment featured dueling op-eds from\nRay Washburne\n, vice chairman of Gillon Property Group and a heavy investor in downtown properties, as well as a\ntrio of prominent architects\narguing for City Hall\u2019s preservation.\nWashburne\nframed his proposal as a reset moment for downtown. He argued the city is at a \u201ccrossroads\u201d and should rethink how to maximize what he called \u201cthe largest property tax base for a primary residential city.\u201d In his telling, a roughly $2 billion\nMavericks arena\nand entertainment district on the City Hall site would generate far more tax revenue than a government-owned building that pays none, while catalyzing a broader development wave.\nWashburne said the arena project, paired with other initiatives like the overhaul of the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center, could spark as much as $10 billion in downtown investment. As part of that vision, he suggested relocating City Hall a few blocks away to Founders Square, a circa-1915 building at 1000 Jackson Street that he owns.\nThe counterargument, laid out by GFF co-founder Duncan Fulton, Omniplan principal emeritus Tipton Housewright and AIA Dallas executive director Zaida Basora, focused heavily on both dollars and civic identity. While acknowledging City Hall\u2019s \u201creal problems,\u201d the architects said they could be addressed \u201ceasily and affordably\u201d through redesigned entrances, modernized interiors and better wayfinding.\nThey also pitched a radical redesign of the windswept plaza outside City Hall, recasting it as a pocket park with trees, water and space for performances. The building\u2019s central location, they argued, is an asset, not a liability. An expanded City Hall campus could even house a long-sought one-stop permitting center for developers, turning the complex into a daily engine of downtown activity.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava blocked an industrial project planned on 245 acres outside the Urban Development Boundary, citing concerns over wetlands and other issues.\nOn Monday, Levine Cava vetoed the commission\u2019s approval of the project, igniting what will likely be yet another showdown between the mayor and commissioners over expansion of the UDB.\nCounty commissioners, sitting as the comprehensive development master plan and zoning board,\ngreenlit\na text amendment on Jan. 22 that would have allowed heavy equipment company Kelly Tractor to build its headquarters, where it would sell, store and repair machinery, on land outside the UDB, including on more than 160 acres of wetlands. The site is west of Sweetwater.\nA supermajority vote by county commissioners is required to override the veto. Commissioners will take up the item on Feb. 18.\nKelly Tractor, a Florida-based firm since the 1930s that supplies equipment such as hydraulic drills for excavators, is based in Doral and has said it needs a bigger headquarters to support county infrastructure projects, such as highways and airports, South Florida NPR affiliate\nWLRN\nreported.\nThe county board approved the text amendment, despite Miami-Dade staff members recommending denial, claiming that the county has plenty of land for industrial development within the UDB and that Kelly Tractor\u2019s application failed to show how it will mitigate wetlands that the project would pave over.\nMiami-Dade is generally a developer-friendly county, with elected officials often helping the private sector score approval for projects, as real estate is a major economic driver in the county. But building outside the UDB, an invisible boundary meant to stop suburban sprawl onto farmland, wetlands and the Everglades, is one of the most controversial proposals a developer can make, with few projects scoring approval and, often, those that do face other challenges.\nIn a Sunday memo, Levine Cava said she vetoed the project because it didn\u2019t sufficiently address impacts on wetlands of exceptional environmental value and because the approval was for a text amendment, circumventing the traditional application process for development outside the UDB. County staff had previously said in records the wetlands on the Kelly Tractor site are top tier.\nAt the Jan. 22 meeting, Kelly Tractor agreed to commissioners\u2019 request that any portion of the 60 acres of wetlands not mitigated on the site be mitigated elsewhere within Miami-Dade. But Kelly Tractor didn\u2019t commit to county staff\u2019s request to prioritize mitigation in the North Trail Basin, Levine Cava said in her memo.\nWetlands have multiple purposes, including flood protection and filtration of water before it reaches Miami-Dade\u2019s drinking water aquifer, she said. They also are a habitat for wildlife.\nProposals for projects outside the UDB have to go through an amendment process, but text amendment applications lack the \u201crobust growth analysis and planning procedures\u201d that a traditional UDB expansion process would require, Levine Cava said in her memo. .\n\u201cThe presentation of a text change in this case enabled substantially less specificity and commitment on the future development than an application that followed a UDB amendment process,\u201d Levine Cava wrote in the memo.\nChris Kelly, president of Kelly Tractor, declined to comment on the veto. He pointed\nThe Real Deal\nto a 2017 study prepared by engineering firm CH2M for Miami-Dade, looking at several potential sites for a new county wastewater treatment plant, determining Kelly Tractor\u2019s property outside the UDB is the most suitable location. That project never panned out.\nThe last time county commissioners approved a massive project outside the UDB was in 2022 when they greenlit the South Dade Logistics &amp; Technology District on 379 acres. It took developers Stephen Blumenthal and Jose Hevia five public hearings to get the approval, with the pair giving concessions along the way, including cutting the project size by about half.\nLevine Cava\nvetoed\nthat project, too, and commissioners subsequently\noverrode\nher veto.\nSouth Dade Logistics\nfizzled out\nin court in 2024.\n",

With the\u00a0 P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related Group, Rockpoint completed the 393-unit The Point at Miramar apartment building in the Broward County city in 2024, selling it for\n$161 million\nlast year.\nAlso last year, Rockpoint was part of a joint venture that sold the One Clearlake office building in West Palm Beach for\n$45 million\n, marking a nearly 26 percent discount from what the JV paid in 2021.\nSouth Florida\u2019s apartment supply overhang is the result of developers seizing on the pandemic-induced influx of newcomers with plans for new projects. In 2024, they completed a record of more than\n18,600 units\n, according to CoStar Group.\nDevelopers with planned or under construction projects say that by the time their buildings are finished, between this year and 2028, demand will\ncatch up\n. They are confident in the lease-up of the projects, arguing construction starts have slowed, which will allow for supply to be absorbed.\nLast year, 12,718 apartments were completed in South Florida, according to CoStar. That\u2019s fewer than the record in 2024 and the 15,426 unit completions in 2023, but still more than the 11,002 and 11,660 unit completions in 2021 and 2022, respectively.\nMultifamily construction financing has flowed in South Florida, despite higher interest rates. In December, Trilogy Real Estate Group landed an\n$82.3 million\nconstruction loan for a 247-unit project in Miami\u2019s Edgewater, and Focus and Group Fox scored\n$250 million\nto build a 517-unit apartment tower in Brickell.\n",

The portfolio spans roughly 3,600 units split between Los Angeles-Orange County and the San Diego-Inland Empire region, according to Piper Sandler.\nIf completed, the sale would mark a sharp pullback from one of the country\u2019s most expensive and tightly regulated housing markets. Camden is one of the nation\u2019s larger\napartment owners\n, developers and operators, with 177 communities totaling more than 60,000 units across 15 markets, according to the outlet. The bulk of its portfolio sits in Sun Belt metros, with smaller beachheads in California and Washington, D.C.\nCamden wouldn\u2019t be the first major\napartment player\nto rethink its West Coast exposure. Atlanta-based\nWood Partners\nsaid last year it would wind down its California operations after finishing projects already underway. While Wood didn\u2019t spell out its reasons, developers have long complained about the difficulty of entitling, building and operating apartments in the state, according\u00a0 to the outlet.\nExecutives at\nCamden\n, however, have been more explicit, repeatedly flagging California\u2019s regulatory environment, high operating costs and shifting renter dynamics as headwinds. According to the publication, during the company\u2019s first quarter 2025 earnings call, Executive Vice Chairman Keith Oden summed up the uncertainty by suggesting multifamily operators always have to ask what the next regulatory \u201cbullet\u201d will be in the state.\nAnalysts appear supportive of a potential exit. In comments to Multifamily Dive, Mizuho Securities managing director Haendel St. Juste said Camden has \u201cdocumented its frustration\u201d with the state\u2019s rules, pandemic-era rent policies and tenant behavior. Reducing exposure, he said, would be a net positive for the REIT\u2019s long-term strategy.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "When it comes to ultra-luxury residential sales, Dallas is\nstill on top\n.\nDallas/Fort Worth\nled the state in sales dollar volume for homes listed above $10 million last year, according to Compass\u2019s ultra-luxury report, which draws from local Multiple Listing Service data. According to some agents, the metro\u2019s desirable neighborhoods and durable business environment do much to propel it past Houston, which has a hot but\ntightly concentrated enclave\nof ultra-luxury stock, and Austin, a\nmore diffuse market\nwhich depended almost singularly on the\ntech industry\nfor its most recent boom.\nIn 2025, 15 homes listed above $10 million sold in Dallas/Fort Worth, adding up to more than $231 million in ultra-luxury sales volume, according to Compass. Houston took second place with 10 sales and $121 million in ultra-luxury volume, and Austin was a distant third with two sales totaling about $25 million in volume.\nTexas is a non-disclosure state, so the final sale prices of these homes aren\u2019t available.\nThe Dallas ultra-luxury market benefits from a steady stream of businesses moving to the area, according to Compass agent Amy Detwiler, co-founder of Compass\u2019s top-producing team in Texas.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the economy in Dallas and the pro-business attitude. There are large companies moving to Dallas and expanding their headquarters, and everyone is very excited about the expansion of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley,\u201d Detwiler said.\nBased on MLS data\n, Dallas has been the steadiest ultra-luxury market in the state since the housing boom of 2021 and 2022. Eleven homes over $10 million sold in\nAustin in 2021\nduring the city\u2019s tech industry boom \u2014 just one more than the 10 sales in Dallas/Fort Worth that year, according to Compass\u2019 report. Just three years later, in 2024, Austin had zero ultra-luxury sales while Dallas/Fort Worth had 13.\nWith 10 sales totaling $121 million in ultra-luxury dollar volume last year, Houston barely surpassed half the $234 million of volume completed in Dallas. However, Space City has enjoyed a meteoric rise in attention from the wealthiest buyers in the past few years. Last year\u2019s numbers represent quite a boost after\nHouston had zero residential sales above $10 million in 2020 and 2021\n.\nIn Houston, ultra-luxury buyers scramble for a relatively limited set of homes in the River Oaks neighborhood. Five of the\ntop 10 residential sales in Harris County\nlast year took place within one square mile. Between Highland Park, University Park and Preston Hollow, Dallas has a broader range of options for ultra-wealthy buyers, Detwiler said.\nMeanwhile,\nAustin\u2019s top sales are almost all outside the city\n, with many strung on large lots along the Colorado River, indicating relatively weak demand for the city\u2019s central neighborhoods.\n",

The complaint centers on Urban East Apartments, a 381-unit complex at 6400 East Riverside Drive in the Montopolis neighborhood.\nGreystar\nalleges a hot water pipe failure triggered \u201ccatastrophic damage\u201d throughout the building after the system was improperly installed. The Charleston, South Carolina-based multifamily giant claims the fault lies with Bartlett Cocke and its\nsubcontractors\n, pointing to inadequate oversight and construction errors.\nAccording to the lawsuit, plumbers failed to install a thermostatic mixing valve in one of the buildings\u2019 hot water systems, a device designed to limit water temperature. When the boilers were turned on in December 2023, the water temperature allegedly surged to the system\u2019s maximum of 180 degrees, Bisnow\nreported\n. The heat caused a PVC pipe on the fourth floor to separate from the system, unleashing water that damaged multiple parts of the property.\nGreystar\nis seeking damages for negligence from Bartlett Cocke as well as several subcontractors, including Liberty Hill-based Basey Plumbing, Houston-based FCS Mechanical, plumber Enrique Corona Ramirez and Austin-based Nichols Engineering. The complaint alleges each defendant bears responsibility through improper installation, failure to review system design or failure to reduce water temperatures.\nThree insurers \u2014 Allianz Underwriters, Steadfast Insurance Company and Starr Surplus Lines Insurance Company \u2014 have also joined the case in an effort to recoup insurance payouts tied to the damage.\nThe lawsuit was filed Jan. 16 in the 126th District Civil Court of Travis County under Judge Aurora Martinez Jones and was transferred to Texas\u2019 Business Court on Jan. 27 at Bartlett Cocke\u2019s request.\nConstruction on the project began in 2022, and the pipe failure occurred roughly a year later, the suit states. Greystar\u2019s attorneys allege Bartlett Cocke\u2019s \u201cnegligent undertaking\u201d was a substantial factor in the failure and the resulting damage.\nBartlett Cocke,\nGreystar and their attorneys did not respond to requests for comment.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Karen Bass with 3980 Bill Robertson Lane in Los Angeles\n*please pull Getty and/or Google Maps images of LA Mayor Karen Bass and the Expo Center at 3980 Bill Robertson Lane in Los Angeles. This is art for Bass\u2019s state of the city address, which will be held at the Expo Center\nReal estate was left wanting more \u2014 a lot more when it came to Los Angeles Mayor\nKaren Bass\n\u2019s\nState of the City\non Monday.\nThis summer\u2019s FIFA World Cup and U.S. Women\u2019s Open, along with the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic games, dominated much of Bass\u2019s address beginning with the remarks being delivered about five miles southwest of city hall at the Expo Center in Los Angeles\u2019s Exposition Park neighborhood south of downtown.\nAfter last week\u2019s messy battle over the two-tier property-transfer tax, Measure United to House L.A. (Measure ULA), Bass offered little to shed light on where she stands on major reforms proposed by Councilmember\nNithya Raman\nthat would create aggressive carveouts across commercial and residential real estate. Bass\u2019s own push to get Palisades Fire-impacted property owners relief from the tax, which she introduced in\nOctober\n, was also absent from Monday\u2019s address.\nMeasure ULA applies to sales of properties that sell for at least $5.3 million, applying a 4 percent levy on the deal and increases to 5.5 percent for those trading for $10.6 million or more.\nRaman is a Democratic Socialist and prominent local progressive. She represents the city\u2019s 4th District and attempted last week to get her City Council peers to consider and vote on a 15-year exemption from the so-called mansion tax for newly constructed apartments, commercial and mixed-use projects. Raman had hoped to push the item onto the June ballot, but it was instead kicked to the\nHousing and Homelessness Committee\n. Her move raised hopes among real estate executives in the commercial and residential sectors, who want to see the city roll back ULA,\u00a0 while also inflaming the\nMeasure ULA Citizen Oversight Committee\nfor bypassing the group established to monitor implementation of the tax.\nInstead, the only reference to ULA on Monday was when Bass confirmed the approval of $14 million in rental assistance for seniors and individuals with disabilities. The city confirmed those funds came from the over $1 billion ULA has generated since its inception in April 2023.\nWhile Bass stressed the need to \u201ccontinue accelerating the construction of permanent affordable housing\u201d \u2014 a key point in Raman\u2019s explanation for her proposed carveouts \u2014 a firm stance on the mansion tax didn\u2019t factor into the mayor\u2019s address.\nRebuild: year two\nSpecifics around the Pacific Palisades in year two of the rebuild were also thin.\nBass said she, along with Councilmember Traci Park and Palisades residents, would travel to Sacramento next week \u201cto make clear to the state that continued investment in building the Palisades is not optional; it is essential.\u201d\nWhile permitting was mentioned by Bass, it was to confirm more than 400 homes are under construction in the neighborhood, while \u201chundreds more\u201d have received approvals.\nThe remarks come as the mayor and California Gov. Gavin Newsom fend off heat from the federal government over permitting delays. Late last month President Donald Trump signed off on an executive order authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Small Business Administration to leap over local permitting to create a self-certification process for builders, which a federally appointed agency would oversee.\nIt\u2019s unclear if the Trump\nadministration\nhas authority to step into local permitting processes, and whether it also\u00a0 plans to inject itself into California\u2019s tangled insurance ecosystem, which has been a major cause of delays in jumpstarting rebuilding.\nA total of 10 homes have been rebuilt and about 2,500 projects have been permitted post-Palisades and Eaton fires, according to the federal government.\nElection year\nThe rosy outlook was delivered in an\nelection year\n, crowded with 25 hopefuls looking to unseat Bass as mayor of Los Angeles.\nThe most recent to enter the field was former \u201cThe Hills\u201d reality TV star\nSpencer Pratt\n, who announced his bid for the seat in January on the anniversary of the Palisades Fire. There\u2019s also Austin Beutner, a former L.A. deputy mayor and Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent, and Democratic Socialist of America Rae Chen Huang, who some call a longshot candidate likened to New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani.\nBass has pulled in the lion\u2019s share of funding, so far raising $2.4 million in campaign contributions as of Dec. 31, according to the Los Angeles Ethics Commission. Meanwhile, Beutner\u2019s raised $314,601, while Huang \u2014 who announced her bid for mayor in mid-November \u2014 has drawn $107,644 as of Dec. 31.\n",

To see the top office sales in Culver City last year click\nhere\n.\nFenway Capital, which has an office in Solana Beach and Dallas, acquired the 315,000-square-foot office building at 6181 Centinela Avenue in April for about $413 per square foot.\nThe $130 million price tag didn\u2019t cover the $142.5 million in debt sellers, Lincoln Property Company and Goldman Sachs affiliate Broad Street Principal Investments, took on six years prior to develop Entrada.\nA source told\nTRD\nat the time of the sale that the $130 million deal was a \u201crecapitalization\u201d of the 11-story property.\nDallas-based Lincoln Property retained a minority stake in the property and was set to continue managing it, the source said.\nThe joint venture partners bought the formerly stalled development site in 2018 for $33 million and took out a $142.5 million construction loan from Singapore-based United Overseas Bank the following year, per property records. The building was completed in 2022.\nPrior to the sale to Fenway Capital, Equinox signed a lease in the building. The deal brought the property to roughly 75 percent leased, with global accounting firm Deloitte, digital ad platform The Trade Desk and toy manufacturer Jazwares on the tenant roster, according to the source.\nReal estate investment firm Fenway Capital\u2019s portfolio spans Arizona, California, Nevada, Oklahoma and Texas.\nIts eight other California properties include the Terrace on Cedros three-building commercial project in Solana Beach and E Street, a 20-unit apartment complex in San Diego.\nThe firm has underway the 4-acre Marea Village in Encinitas which will include 96 rental units and a 30-key expansion of the Alila Marea Resort, as well as retail space and public amenities.\n",

An unnamed investor is already negotiating to buy the property, according to Bloomberg.\nOceanwide filed for bankruptcy in 2024 and has failed to attract a buyer since then, in part due to the cost of completing the project and preparing for residential and retail tenants once acquired. \u201cWe get a lot of interest, and it\u2019s just finding a billion and a half dollars to complete the project is proving difficult,\u201d Colliers\u2019 Mark Tarczynski, part of the team marketing the building,\ntold The Real Deal\nlast year.\nOceanwide Holdings owes roughly $400 million to creditors, including $180 million to\nEB-5 visa investors\n, $175 million to contractors led by Lendlease Corporation and $18 million for county taxes,\nTRD\npreviously reported. Under the bankruptcy-exit agreement, lender group LA Development Investment LP is entitled to a $230 million claim. Other creditors also have hundreds of millions of dollars in additional claims.\n\u201cA prompt sale and eventual completion of the project is a major priority for the city and the public at large, particularly with the upcoming\n2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles\n,\u201d lawyers for Oceanwide Plaza said in a\ncourt filing\nlate last month, noting the city \u201cfully supports the approval of the [bankruptcy] settlement agreement.\u201d\nIn reaching the settlement agreement, creditors and the project owner put an \u201cimmediate stop\u201d to the \u201cvalue-destructive litigation, preserving estate assets and allowing the debtor to pivot from endless legal battles to the productive work of selling the project and confirming a plan,\u201d lawyers for Oceanwide said in the filing.\nConstruction at\nOceanwide Plaza\nhas been stalled since 2019 when China Oceanwide ran out of funding for the project. The buildings were never fully enclosed, leaving them open to members of the public trespassing and marking the street-facing floors with graffiti. In the post-pandemic years, the buildings became symbolic of\nDowntown Los Angeles\u2019 tepid office market\n\u2014 a period from which it still has yet to emerge.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Mark Furman began his career at a nonprofit doing what Mayor Zohran Mamdani would call God\u2019s work: helping affordable housing residents take over their buildings.\nBut the laws of physics and finance prevailed in the end, as they always do.\nIn the early 1980s, his nonprofit used Section 8 and other federal funds to renovate aging, low-rise buildings in Madison, Wisconsin, and taught the subsidized residents how to self-manage and keep costs down.\n\u201cThe staff provided guidance and support \u2014 helping develop budgets, working with residents to identify maintenance needs,\u201d Furman said by email. \u201cIt was a great model and I loved helping folks take control of a small corner of their own lives. But it ultimately failed.\u201d\nThe government had adequately funded the initial work but not the long-term needs of the properties, and the restricted rents did not make up the shortfall.\n\u201cThere simply was not enough money in reserves or other funding available to fix the structural and capital problems that are inevitable with any real estate, let alone renovated older properties,\u201d Furman wrote. \u201cRoofs, HVAC systems, old pipes \u2014 buildings require constant feeding and care, as any property manager well knows.\u201d\nNew York City\u2019s own property crisis is like the one he encountered in Wisconsin but on a massive scale: Hundreds of rent-stabilized buildings are\nin distress\nas escalating expenses and a\ntourniquet on rents\nforce owners to defer maintenance.\nFurman is on the front lines. He was hired by a lender to manage 38 rent-stabilized buildings in\nSpanish Harlem\n, on which it is foreclosing. The owner stopped sinking money into the 900-unit portfolio but still couldn\u2019t make the mortgage payments.\n\u201cWe are just trying to keep the units habitable and operational while the lender seeks to gain title and then dispose of the properties to offset its losses,\u201d Furman wrote.\nBut even without having to pay debt service, the rent revenue \u2014 which Mamdani\naims to freeze\n\u2014 simply isn\u2019t enough.\n\u201cIt is often hard to cover basic operating costs, taxes, and rising insurance premiums for many of the buildings given the restricted rents, let alone try to address years and years of deferred maintenance on boilers, roofs, pipes, gas lines, cameras, etc.,\u201d Furman explained.\n\u201cMy staff and I respond as quickly as possible to problems with failing boilers, rotting gas lines, decaying roofs, moldy bathrooms with inadequate ventilation, but the litany of problems in these long-neglected properties is staggering.\u201d\nThe property manager\u2019s 876-word message to\nThe Real Deal\nshould be required reading for Mamdani. The mayor hasn\u2019t acknowledged the impossibility of maintaining aging buildings with\nuncontrollable expenses\nand\nlow rents\nthat tenants increasingly\ndon\u2019t pay\n.\nInstead, he has blamed landlords for the dilapidated condition of buildings and announced\n\u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings\nto let tenants do the same \u2014 as if shaming owners changes the math when regulated rents are already too low to keep properties up to code.\nBeneath the surface of Mamdani\u2019s public narrative, his\ncourt filings\nand\nlobbying\nshow his strategies for distressed, rent-stabilized buildings include\ndevaluing them\nto reduce debt service and\nsteering them to nonprofits\nto eliminate property taxes.\nThe mayor has also said he wants to work with the real estate industry, but nothing indicates he has spoken to people like Furman. The property manager\u2019s reward for trying valiantly to stabilize the buildings was a place on Public Advocate Jumaane Williams\u2019\n\u201cworst landlords\u201d list\n.\nA simple check of\nproperty records\nshows the six properties that landed Furman on the list are actually owned by Isaac Kassirer, who bought them with financing from California-based Sabal Capital just before the rent laws changed in 2019.\n\u201cI guarantee that we are doing much better than the last group that owned these apartments, but it is going to take more than patching them up to ensure long-term stability for these units,\u201d Furman wrote. \u201cIt requires a significant capital improvement plan that the restricted rents cannot support on their own.\u201d\nFurman said he would love to live in a world where people without means are guaranteed housing. But his decades of experience with affordable housing \u201cmakes it clear that this cannot happen solely on the backs of the free market.\u201d\n\u201cI have heard it said that Republicans like to privatize profits and socialize costs,\u201d Furman observed. \u201cMamdani is the inverse, it seems, seeking to privatize the social costs of affordable housing. It will not work.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The REST Act has not been put to rest.\nThe acronyms that plague the real estate industry are having a moment.\nLast week, the City Council decided\nagainst\noverriding former Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 veto of the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act, or COPA. The bill\u2019s sponsor, the mayor and Council leadership, however, made clear that they are committed to reintroducing the bill.\nAs that\ndrama\nunfolded last week, state lawmakers and tenant advocates recommitted to a\nmeasure\nthat would make it easier for localities outside New York City to adopt rent regulation, dubbed the Rent Emergency Stabilization for Tenants, or REST, Act.\nTowns and cities in the state can opt into rent stabilization if they find that a housing emergency exists, which is defined as having a housing vacancy rate of 5 percent or less.\nThe REST Act created another avenue for localities to declare a housing emergency. In addition to basing the emergency on vacancy rates, they can declare an emergency after considering publicly available data, such as local rent burdens and availability of affordable housing, and hold public hearings.\nSen. Brian Kavanagh, the bill\u2019s sponsor and chair of his chamber\u2019s Committee on Housing, Construction and Community Development, called the measure \u201ca critical priority\u201d during a press conference hosted by lawmakers and Housing Justice for All, adding that he hopes it is approved this year. Assembly member Linda Rosenthal said there is no reason why other parts of the state \u201cshould not have the same rights and protections that we in New York City have.\u201d\nHomeowners for an Affordable New York, a coalition of landlord groups, disagree.\n\u201cExpanding these policies to municipalities statewide will only deepen the affordable housing shortage, raise costs for residents and hurt the people who need housing the most,\u201d the coalition said in a statement.\nGov. Kathy Hochul did not include the measure in her executive budget, nor another priority for the tenant advocates: an increase in funding for the state\u2019s housing voucher program. Hochul\u2019s budget calls for $50 million for the Housing Voucher Access Program, the same amount as last year and well short of the $250 million sought by lawmakers and advocates.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: What changes will the City Council make to\nCOPA\nbefore reintroducing the bill? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Vornado Realty Trust is listed as part of one of the teams vying to take over the Penn Station overhaul. New York Focus\nreports\nthat the real estate investment trust appeared on an Amtrak memo describing the members of each team that was selected as a finalist in the competition to become the station\u2019s master developer. Vornado was listed among several firms that make up the team led by Halmar.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\u00a0 On Saturday, Mayor Zohran Mamdani tapped Dr. Alister Martin as the commissioner of the city\u2019s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. The mayor also named Stanley Richards as commissioner of the city\u2019s Department of Correction and Yesenia Mata as commissioner of the Department of Veterans\u2019 Services.\n\u2014 Con Edison says salt mixed with melted ice and snow that has seeped to underground powerlines is to blame for outages in Brooklyn,\nGothamist reports\n. As of Monday, 2,000 customers in the borough were without power, according to Con Ed.\n\u2014 As of Friday, the city\u2019s snow-melting machines, spread out across eight sites, had liquified 23 million pounds of snow, according to the mayor.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$29.5 million\nfor a condominium unit at 53 West 53rd Street. The condo is new construction and 6,500 square feet.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s\nRenee Micheli, Jade Chan, Frances Katzen and Michelle Griffith had the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$12.5 million\nfor 639 Grand Street. The Williamsburg retail building is 9,500 square feet.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $57.5 million for 8 East 62nd Street. The Lenox Hill home is nearly 15,000 square feet. It last sold on the market in 2022 for $48 million.\nThe Modlin Group\nhas the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 42,075-square-foot, nine-story, 78-unit residential building at 622 Ocean Avenue in Flatbush. Leandro Dickson of LND Architect is the applicant of record.\n\u2014\nJoseph Jungermann",

        "content": "On a cold morning in January, the head of the city\u2019s housing agency, Dina Levy, toured apartment buildings in Hell\u2019s Kitchen.\nThe buildings, at 351-357 West 45th Street, were once owned by notorious landlord Steve Croman and are undergoing a $20 million renovation by the new owners, SMJ Development, High Point Property Group and Services for the UnderServed.\nThe transformation of these buildings is linked to both Levy\u2019s past roles and her new one as the city\u2019s new commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. Before joining Mayor Zohran Mamdani\u2019s administration, Levy was working as a senior advisor to the New York Attorney General when that office brought criminal and civil charges related to allegations of mortgage fraud and\ntenant harassment\nagainst Croman in 2016. Years later, HPD provided financing for a significant renovation of the properties, which were dilapidated and rodent-infested when the new owners took over.\nLevy is taking HPD\u2019s helm as it navigates how best to handle buildings in deep distress, and as it gears up to take on bad landlords through the\nOffice to Protect Tenants\nand \u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings. For extreme cases, Mayor Mamdani\nhas said\nthat the city will seize buildings from\nslumlords who fail\nto make urgent repairs, and administration officials have\nenumerated\nthe benefits of city ownership.\nBut in an interview last week, Levy said the city doesn\u2019t just seize property. She pointed to the city\u2019s 7a program, under which court-appointed administrators take over management of buildings where conditions are unsafe. Properties with unpaid tax bills have also been transferred through the city\u2019s\nthird-party transfer program\nand the lien sale.\nBefore working for the state Attorney General, Levy was the director of organizing at the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board (a nonprofit that has taken over buildings through the third-party transfer program and worked with tenants to convert the properties into limited-equity co-ops).\nMost recently, she served as the senior vice president of single-family and community development with the state\u2019s Division of Homes and Community Renewal, or HCR.\nLevy was charged with a broad portfolio at HCR, where she ran the agency\u2019s homeownership new construction program, as well as some small, multifamily rental construction, while also\u00a0 overseeing its resiliency work and the State of New York Mortgage Agency.\n\u201cWhat I think I missed when I was at the state was a place-based perspective. You\u2019re running to Syracuse, Rochester, Long Island and New York City,\u201d she said in a recent interview. \u201cThere\u2019s something nice about being back in a place where you are focused on the metes and bounds of the city, and can be a lot more strategic.\u201d\nDuring an interview last week, Levy described how she\u2019s thinking of her new role. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\nWhat do you see as your priorities coming into HPD?\nI\u2019ve been cautious about jumping to conclusions because it\u2019s a big agency. But I had a sense of the top issues from a meta-perspective. Probably in this order, there is a lot of fragility in the existing affordable stock, but also in the privately-owned stock, in the rent-regulated and also the market-rate. That\u2019s largely driven by a significant rise in expenses, with insurance, taxes and utilities. I think a big piece of what we\u2019ll be focused on is: preservation, shoring up both our partners who are already subsidized and also opportunities [where] there [are] struggling portfolios that the city can intervene and then bring under a regulatory framework that preserves and actually expands the amount of affordable housing.\nWhat else?\nWe obviously have to build a lot more. I think the big challenge [is] the rising cost of construction. I was doing a lot of work at the state, looking at new technologies, looking at off-site construction, factory-built. I know we\u2019ve tried some modular projects that haven\u2019t necessarily achieved the full success that everybody\u2019s hoping for, but I think there\u2019s some interesting diagnostics that we\u2019re doing right now about why that isn\u2019t working, and what we could do to make it work.\nThe third thing is efficiencies to bring into HPD and across other city agencies to build faster, more efficiently. Sometimes HPD gets a bad rap that somehow we\u2019re slowing things down, or we\u2019re too bureaucratic. I would say the work that comes out of that agency is awe-inspiring, but that is not to say there aren\u2019t efficiencies or improvements that I think we can bring to bear.\nThere\u2019s a fourth [that will be the focus of the mayor\u2019s Office to Protect Tenants]: Are we doing everything we need to do in terms of enforcement? When I was at the AG, we formed this task force that still goes on between HCR, the AG, HPD and Department of Buildings. I think that that needs to be looked at again, to say, are we getting out to portfolios, early upstream, to prevent that [systemic] deterioration?\nWhat should the city\u2019s role be in taking over such properties?\nWe don\u2019t take over properties. It\u2019s not quite how I would put it. We typically don\u2019t own real estate, and probably shouldn\u2019t own real estate. I do think we should be facilitating transactions like [the Croman property]. We need to have the ability to both use our enforcement tools to bring the bad actors to the table, and then finance preservation purchases. I think that is our role with the Office to Protect Tenants.\nWith that office, though, there\u2019s been a lot of talk about seizing properties.\nI think we should be careful about seizing property. There\u2019s a constitution. We can\u2019t take property. But I think there are enforcement actions that we can bring to bear, that we can do things like\n7a\n, and when there is complete willful disregard for the law, we can remove a manager, or remove an owner and put in responsible management. We have a huge network of affordable for-profits and nonprofit partners who are willing to take on projects. Our job is to make those matches and facilitate, from a financial perspective, those transactions.\nDo you think nonprofits are in a better position to stabilize these properties?\nWe need a big tent, right? There is certainly a huge role for the nonprofits to play, but also for the for-profit, mission-based affordable housing providers. Nonprofits, by definition, are doing this without a motivation for profit, which is important when you\u2019re creating affordable housing. I think they have a particularly important role to play, but not to the exclusion of a bunch of really good for-profit developers who are mission-focused, who are not looking to exceedingly take profit out of buildings, but actually want to invest in their buildings. I think we need both. There\u2019s also a third option, which is tenant ownership, which has a role to play in that debate.\nWhen you were at UHAB, you helped organize tenants at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue to avoid sale of the building to what was seen as a predatory buyer. But under the owner who took over, the property has many active violations. Do you still see that deal as a model?\nWorkforce Housing Group is [a] for-profit mission-based group. They\u2019ve owned the building a really long time, and the tenants made that selection. This was not foisted upon them. They selected Workforce Housing, and I think, have a really nice partnership. That building is going through [a multi-million-dollar] renovation. You have a responsible for-profit who is in partnership with the tenants, and now that it\u2019s time to recapitalize the building, they\u2019re doing that. It\u2019s understandable that as things age, they need to be recapitalized, but that\u2019s what a responsible landlord does. It\u2019s 100 percent the right model.\nThe City Council revived two bills that were vetoed by Mayor Eric Adams that create new regulations for city-financed housing. How will they affect HPD\u2019s ability to produce housing?\nThe question right now is: do these bills go too far in prescribing what\u2019s viable? In an effort to make sure we [are] building big enough units, are building enough homeownership, you can get over-prescriptive in a way that makes it really hard to respond to the market, so I think that\u2019s the balance that we have to strike.\nThe \u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings are focused on giving tenants an opportunity to testify about their experiences. But do you think the hearings will result in any policies that will help landlords?\nThe way we\u2019ve been thinking about the hearings, from HPD\u2019s perspective, is where we need to make improvements around code enforcement. One is a need to potentially expand the 7a program. That\u2019s been underutilized in the last few years. The second is really how we coordinate our efforts with other agencies, particularly DOB.\nThe thing that\u2019s come up most recently is we\u2019re hearing that some landlords or managers are using the threat of ICE to retaliate against tenants who complain or call 311, and I think that needs to be looked at very closely.\nOn the landlord question, which I haven\u2019t been thinking [about] as much through the lens of the hearings, I think there is fragility in the market, which means landlords are also struggling. We are exploring a number of ways to bring resources to well-meaning, law-abiding landlords that are potentially struggling. I think that struggle is largely being driven by expenses, which have increased significantly in just the last five years. One of the things we\u2019re looking closely at is insurance.\nWould that coincide with the rent freeze?\nWe\u2019re not going to solve this dislocation between expenses and income right now with a rent increase. I think the right thing to be doing is focusing on resources to make sure landlords can maintain their buildings, and what we can do to bring down some of the expenses. You can get overly focused on freezing rents or [not freezing] rents, but I think it sort of misses the point.\nWe hear a lot from developers about 485x and the construction wages attached to the property tax break.\nI\u2019ve started to have some conversations with landlords who are would-be users or actual users of\n485x\nabout what is working and what is not working. I want to have some real conversations to find out [if] we need to make some accommodations in light of the prevailing wage and the deeper affordability restrictions. I think there\u2019s an interesting question there about what the city and HPD specifically needs to do to make sure that program remains usable and effective, because I think it will be a big part of achieving the mayor\u2019s housing plan.\nDo you think there will be more examples of the city intervening in situations like the sale of the Pinnacle portfolio?\nI know there will. There are several portfolios that we have been watching. I think there will be some more portfolios coming down the pike that are going to either end up in foreclosure or bankruptcy or something similar. I think having the administration so directly focused on that is great. I see it as an opportunity to bring some of these units into HPD regulatory structures, potentially through financing, and also to be watching them very closely to make sure whoever is buying them \u2014\u00a0like in the case of Summit\nbuying\nthe Pinnacle portfolio \u2014 that we will be watching that very closely, and that they will be expected to repair the building, put in all the resources, not be harassing tenants.\n",

        "content": "The second week of the Alexander brothers\u2019 sex trafficking trial resumed testimony on the\nfirst video of an alleged attack presented in the case\n, showing Oren Alexander having sex with a 17-year-old woman who says she had no memory of the encounter or recording before she was contacted by the government.\nThe video and two witnesses that led off the week\u2019s proceedings add to the growing list of evidence and women presented to the court by prosecutors\nalleging brothers Oren, Alon and Tal\nworked together in a conspiracy to lure, incapacitate and attack women. The brothers have pleaded not guilty and deny the allegations.\nAttorneys for the brothers on Monday morning contended with potential complications from outside the courtroom, requesting a mistrial following reporting that the brothers were named in the DOJ\u2019s latest tranche of files related to the\nJeffrey Epstein case\n. After questioning individual jury members on whether they had been made aware of anything about the Alexander brothers outside of the courtroom, which all of the jurors denied, Judge Valerie Caproni denied the request.\nMonday\u2019s proceedings picked back up on testimony from a woman seen in a video that prosecutors have cited as the basis of\nOren\u2019s sexual exploitation of a minor charge\n. The file, found on a backup of Oren\u2019s computer, was sent the same night it was captured.\nA woman testifying under the pseudonym Amelia Rosen told the court that she was contacted by the government with a video of the alleged rape, which she had no recollection of and had never seen. The video was shown privately to individual members of the jury.\nShe described working as a model when she was 17 years old, including taking cocaine and other drugs and knowing promoters who invited models to dinners and other events. Rosen, who was born in what was then the U.S.S.R. and is now Ukraine, emigrated to the U.S. when she was 14 years old.\n\u201cIt was very painful and upsetting and very confusing for me to see the things in the video,\u201d she said, calling it \u201cone of the hardest moments of my life.\u201d\nThe video, she said, showed two men having sex with her. \u201cI\u2019m not in an alert state. I look under the influence and I\u2019m not present,\u201d she said.\nMarc Agnifilo, an attorney for Oren, briefly cross-examined Rosen, first confirming the video was captured two months shy of her 18th birthday. He also pressed her on the identities of promoters she came into contact with at the time, who worked with nightclubs and would take models to dinner in exchange for their attendance at certain nightlife spots.\nAnother weekend in the Hamptons allegedly gone wrong\nMonday also saw testimony from a woman testifying under the pseudonym Bela Koval, who alleges she was raped by Oren in 2016.\nKoval testified that she was drugged and raped by Oren during a weekend in the Hamptons in the summer of 2016. Koval, then 23 years old, matched with Alon on the dating app Raya and her friend matched with Oren. Through her friend, the brothers invited them to an all-expenses-paid trip to the Hamptons over Labor Day weekend, Koval said, with a private chef, boat trips and more. She and her friend were promised a private bedroom.\nKoval, who had recovered from a major abdominal surgery about eight to nine months earlier, said she was looking forward to the trip. \u201cI had just had surgery, I was recently single. I wanted to explore the Hamptons for the first time,\u201d she said.\nThe brothers \u2014 Oren, Tal and Alon \u2014 \u201cseemed genuinely happy for us to be there,\u201d Koval said about their arrival at the Hamptons house, which appears to be the\nsame home\ndescribed in testimony delivered last week by a woman who says she was raped by Tal in 2014.\nOn the second day of the trip, the brothers told the women, including others, to wear swimsuits for a party later that day. But when other guests, including clients of the Alexanders, began arriving, Koval said they were dressed more formally than she expected, so she changed into a red jumpsuit. At some point, Oren came up to her and gave her a drink. She took a few sips, but avoided drinking more because of her surgery and subsequent Crohn\u2019s disease diagnosis.\nKoval then described feeling like a switch went off and not feeling like herself. She began to lose control of her body and struggled to make it inside the house, where she planned to go straight to her bedroom. \u201cNever in my life\u201d had she felt like that, she said. That\u2019s when Alon saw her and pulled her into another bedroom, where she laid down.\n\u201cI closed my eyes and I was awoken to the door opening and Oren walking into the room. This is when I realized that I had lost the ability to move my legs and limbs,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mind, I was fully awake and aware. I was able to speak, but it was very faint.\u201d\nShe said that Oren pulled out a condom, got on top of her, pinned her down and raped her. \u201cHe had this brooding energy, almost like anger. He did not say a single word to me,\u201d she said, adding that she woke up the next day in the same bedroom.\nKoval said she and her friend felt trapped and had to stay the day after the alleged rape. \u201cIt felt like I was forced to be around the person who raped me.\u201d They were able to leave the house without the Alexanders noticing the next day, thanks to a friend of a friend.\nProsecutors also questioned Koval on inconsistencies in the story she initially shared with them and her testimony, including what she was wearing at the time of the attack and whether she joined the Alexanders and others on a boat the following day.\n",

Fessler sold his oceanfront Manalapan estate for $31.5 million,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nFessler sold the mansion at 880 South Ocean Boulevard, according to listing agents Antonio and Pascal Liguori with Premier Estate Properties. The Liguoris also represented the buyer in the deal. They declined to comment on the buyer\u2019s identity and the deed has yet to appear in public records.\nFessler is an aviation executive with ties to several aftermarket aircraft products companies, including Magellan Aviation Group and Aeronautical Support International, according to records and published reports. He has also invested in other luxury residential properties in Palm Beach County over the years. In 2017, he sold a spec mansion in Palm Beach for $49 million, the\nPalm Beach Daily News\nreported.\nRecords show he and Daphne Fessler bought the Manalapan mansion for $5.3 million in 2000. Built in 1988, the 1.6-acre estate includes a 6,700-square-foot main house with four bedrooms and four bathrooms, according to property records. It also has a two-bedroom, two-bathroom guest house, the listing shows. The estate\u2019s amenities include a theater, a pool, a dock and 150 feet of frontage on both the ocean and Intracoastal Waterway.\nFessler renovated the home in the 2000s, Antonio Liguori confirmed. He declined to comment on the buyer\u2019s plans for the property, but said the adjacent estate sold as a teardown in 2023 for\n$37 million\n.\nFessler first listed the property for $45 million in 2024, and dropped the price to $38.5 million in February of last year, according to Zillow.\nLiguori said there\u2019s significant demand for the Manalapan market, but buyers are particularly focused on new construction homes, and sites and teardowns for building their own homes. Agents say ultra-luxury buyers like\nManalapan\nfor its larger lots, proximity to Palm Beach, and ocean-to-lake estates, which allow homeowners to have beach frontage as well as a personal dock on the Intracoastal Waterway.\n\u201cThey love the fact that there are other high caliber billionaires that live in the neighborhood,\u201d Liguori said.\nBillionaire Larry Ellison set a record in 2022 when he bought a 16-acre oceanfront compound for\n$173 million\n. Ellison then dropped\n$277.4 million\non the town\u2019s Eau Palm Beach Resort &amp; Spa in 2024.\nIn other recent Manalapan deals,\nbillionaire Randal Kirk\nfound a buyer for his estate asking $90 million after a significant price cut.",

        "content": "One of downtown Chicago\u2019s larger office buildings just sold at a bargain price to\na joint venture\nof two New York-based companies that includes the developer-owner of the Old Post Office.\nDavid Werner Real Estate and 601W Companies paid $41 million for the 1.4 million-square-foot office building at 175 West Jackson Boulevard, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The deal, which closed late last week, values the 22-story building at roughly $29 per square foot.\nNorthwind Group, a New York-based private equity firm, financed the purchase with a $58.5 million loan that included $33.5 million toward the acquisition and another $25 million earmarked for future leasing costs, according to a statement from the lender and people familiar with the deal. JLL brokers Jaime Fink, Bruce Miller and Sam DiFrancesca represented the seller.\nThe sale price is about 87 percent below the $306 million price Brookfield Asset Management\npaid for the Daniel Burnham\u2013designed property in 2018\n, or nearly $219 per square foot. Brookfield also poured roughly $24 million into renovations before the market turned, the outlet reported.\nThe transaction completes a painful haircut for Brookfield and for bondholders tied to the building\u2019s $280 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan, which landed the prooerty in foreclosure in 2022. LNR Partners, the special servicer overseeing the debt, confirmed the sale, but declined to comment. Brookfield also declined to comment, according to the publication.\nThe building \u2014 which spans an entire city block from West Jackson Boulevard to West Van Buren Street \u2014 was 47 percent leased as of the middle of last year, according to JLL marketing materials. A court-appointed receiver managed to stabilize things somewhat by extending the lease of anchor tenant Enova International, though the fintech firm downsized. Wolverine Trading, the property\u2019s second-largest tenant, is\nset to vacate\nabout 88,000 square feet in 2027 for the Old Post Office.\nThe purchase adds to a growing Loop portfolio for 601W, built on distress. The firm and Werner paid about $63 million late last year for the building at 303 East Wacker Drive, a roughly 66 percent discount off its 2018 price, with Northwind also providing financing. In November, 601W paid $35 million for the building at\n525 West Van Buren Street\n, down 74 percent from its prior sale price.\nThe buying spree comes even as 601W grapples with its own office headaches, including looming debt on the Aon Center and 1 South Wacker Drive in Chicago.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Two very different corners of Austin are lining up for major new development, with city approvals advancing a pair of high-rise towers near the University of Texas and clearing the path for a sprawling mixed-use project in South Austin\u2019s St. Elmo Arts District.\nNear\nUT\n, a full city block along West Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and West 18th Street could be remade with two towers rising 37 stories and 34 stories, according to city filings. The Austin Business Journal\nreported\nthat one building would house a 287-key hotel with 61 condos, while the other building would have 318 apartments. Together, the towers would include about 11,400 square feet of retail at street level.\nThe site, bound by Rio Grande Street, is currently a patchwork of low-rise uses, including Jack Brown Cleaners, the original Tiff\u2019s Treats location, a Jimmy John\u2019s and small apartment buildings. The Austin Planning Commission voted to advance zoning changes requested for the project Jan. 27.\nThe developer has not been publicly identified, but the applicant is seeking increased height allowances under Austin\u2019s Downtown Density Bonus Program, which would require City Council approval. The roughly 1.9-acre assemblage is split into two nearly 1-acre parcels separated by an alley that would remain in place, with one tower planned for each side.\nLandowners\ninclude 1806 Group LP, Jack Brown Family II Limited Partnership, Triple Play Properties LTD and Scott Sayers.\nFarther south, a very different type of development is moving forward at 4201 South Congress Avenue, where an eight-building\nmixed-use concept\nsecured a site development permit from the city. The approval, granted Jan. 23, allows construction to proceed through January 2029, the outlet\nreported\n.\nThe project, dubbed 4201 S Congress, calls for roughly 200,000 square feet of retail, restaurant and office space spread across mid-rise buildings at South Congress Avenue and Industrial Boulevard. The owner is 4201 S Congress Ave Owner LLC, which shares an address with California-based Redcar Properties, a developer active elsewhere in the\nSt. Elmo Arts District\n, according to the outlet.\nPlans show a mix of building sizes and uses, including restaurant and office buildings ranging from about 10,500 square feet to nearly 68,000 square feet, several standalone office structures and a six-story parking garage with 494 spaces and ground-floor restaurant space.\nThough Austin\u2019s office vacancy rate hovered around 26 percent at the end of last year, according to CBRE, new development has slowed sharply and absorption has begun to tick up. That might mean that by the time the South Congress project is completed, the current glut of space could look very different.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Fannie Mae said in the filing that Uniondale, New York-based Arbor Realty Trust lent the pair $11.5 million in July 2023 for the 152-unit apartment complex built in 1980.\nLoan trouble began for Del Sol\u2019s owners after\na 2024 fire\nat the property displaced a dozen residents and damaged at least 16 units at the complex. The incident also sparked a dispute between owner and lender over loan payments and property repairs, Fannie Mae said in the suit.\nThe foreclosure process began nearly a year ago when Fannie issued a foreclosure notice in March after claiming the owner defaulted on the loan. Sorotzkin and Menchel sued to block a May sale, according to the filing. The parties settled the dispute in Galveston County District Court, and the investors agreed to have a receiver appointed, Fannie Mae alleges in the suit.\nJudge Jeffrey V. Brown issued an order appointing a receiver in a Jan. 27 filing, court records show. Jacqueline Elizabeth Kimaz of Southlake, a Dallas suburb, will manage the property.\nMultifamily distress has hit Texas hard, as apartment investors struggled to hang onto properties they purchased when interest rates were low at the start of the pandemic. Experts warn the\nwave of foreclosures and receiverships is rising\n, as $19 billion in commercial mortgage-backed securities debt tied to Texas multifamily is set to mature this year.\n",

        "content": "A borrower has accused\nMaverick Real Estate Partners\nof muddying the waters of a loan extension to foreclose on a property.\nNow, the borrower has notched a temporary win with a court ordering the lender to halt any foreclosure.\nThe borrower, connected to\nHilson Management and the Schwalbe family\n, owes a Maverick affiliate $41 million. But when the borrower tried to extend the loan, Maverick\u2019s affiliate allegedly engaged in \u201cvulturous tactics\u201d \u2014 agreeing to take a $400,000 fee to settle the issue, taking the money and then refusing to hold up its end of the bargain, according to the complaint.\nMaverick has gained a reputation as an aggressive real estate lender\n, buying up debt to foreclose. The allegations in the complaint provide an inside look at the firm\u2019s playbook, including conduct that may be over the line for the court.\nThe building at the center of the loan is an early 20th-century property known as the Gorham Building, located at 390 Fifth Avenue. The building has been connected with the Schwalbe family since at least 1969, according to public records.\nThe borrowers owed a $41 million payoff to Maverick due this past New Year\u2019s Eve. But the agreement included an option to extend the loan, one that the borrowers intended to exercise.\nBut after the borrowers reached out and paid a $200,000 extension fee, Maverick allegedly piled on additional requirements. Maverick told borrowers they had to pay $1.5 million in interest shortfall to extend the maturity date, contrary to the loan agreement, the complaint alleges.\nThe parties allegedly agreed to a $400,000 sum instead, one that the borrower wired over.\nBut when Maverick sent out an extension agreement, that number suddenly became $750,000. After the borrower sent over more money, Maverick allegedly said it would refuse to extend the loan at all without the $1.5 million and would instead file for foreclosure on the property.\nThe complaint alleges that Maverick has yet to declare an event of default, but has nonetheless instituted a full cash sweep, leaving the borrower unable to pay for operating expenses.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, Terrence and Darren Oved of Oved &amp; Oved, said the court\u2019s order sends a message to the defendant that its attempts at coercion will fail.\n\u201cOur client\u2019s $50 million damages claim underscores the significant harm caused by Defendant, a harm which we intend to remedy,\u201d the attorneys said in a statement.\nNeither Maverick nor its attorneys on the case immediately responded to a request for comment.\nIn a letter to the court, attorneys for Maverick said the plaintiffs had a \u201ctortured reading\u201d of the loan agreement, which they say plainly requires the interest shortfall paid to secure an extension.\n",

        "content": "And just like that, a group of Boyle Heights residents could become homeless thanks to a former \u201cSex and the City\u201d background actor.\nOn Feb. 5, 85-year-old Columba Torralba and her family are set to be\nevicted\nfrom their apartment on Cesar E. Chavez Avenue after a years-long battle between the tenants and property owner Will Tiao, a former actor and director who left the entertainment industry for real estate and founded Tiao Properties in 2012, the Los Angeles Times reported.\nTiao, once a background actor on \u201cSex and the City,\u201d is planning to demolish the building containing three rent-controlled units to build a six-story residential building with 50 units above ground-floor retail space.\nTiao bought the property near the intersection of Cesar Chavez Avenue and Chicago Street in 2020 for $2.1 million. The landlord and his company, Tiao Properties, first\napplied to redevelop the lots the following year\n, earning city approvals in August 2023. The Los Angeles Department of City Planning gave the project a thumbs-up and said it believes the development will contribute \u201cto the revitalization of Cesar Chavez Avenue\u201d by inviting more\nfoot traffic\nand business, according to the Times.\nThe property owner argued that the development would help Los Angeles meet its housing production goals during a housing crisis. Five of the planned 50 units are reserved for extremely-low-income households, providing more\naffordable housing\nthan the current three units on the property.\nViva Padilla, who ran a bookstore called Re/Arte Centro Librario on the ground floor of one of Tiao\u2019s buildings on Cesar Chavez Avenue, filed an appeal of the city\u2019s decision to allow the development to continue. The appeal was considered by the East Los Angeles Area Planning Commission in early 2024. The Planning Department warned the commission that approving the appeal could open the city up to legal liability because Tiao\u2019s proposal did comply with the law.\nThe commission approved the appeal, and Tiao filed a lawsuit against the city in June 2024, saying the commissioners committed a \u201cblatant and knowing\u201d violation of the state\u2019s Housing Accountability Act. In early 2025, a\njudge ruled\nthat the East Los Angeles Area Planning Commission acted in bad faith in the case and directed the city to approve Tiao\u2019s project again. The city settled the case with Tiao for more than $170,000.\nShortly thereafter, the Torralba family received their first notice to vacate their apartment. They got another letter in December informing them Tiao will provide $25,700 in relocation assistance but would forfeit that money and be subject to \u201cimmediate eviction\u201d if they aren\u2019t out by Feb. 5.\nTiao\u2019s attorney, Cynthia Juno, told the Times the $25,700 was the maximum Tiao Properties could give the Garcia family in relocation assistance. \u201cWe understand why residents are concerned about displacement and rising costs in Boyle Heights,\u201d Juno said. \u201cThese are real pressures across Los Angeles and especially in neighborhoods with deep cultural roots.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

BH purchased the property in June 2023 for $65 million.\nHoly Names University shut its doors in May 2023 shortly before a scheduled foreclosure following a $49 million loan default.

At the same time, another education-to-housing project in the city, the 448-unit\nredevelopment\nof the former California College of the Arts campus in Rockridge, is at a standstill because of financial infeasibility.\nNot all remnants of Holy Names University will disappear.
