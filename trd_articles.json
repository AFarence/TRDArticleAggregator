        "content": "New York City\u2019s chain store count keeps sliding, even as storefront vacancies remain tight and food brands keep expanding.\nThe number of national retailers across the five boroughs fell 1.3 percent over the past year, a net loss of 112 locations, marking the sixth decline in eight years, according to the Center for an Urban Future\u2019s 2025 \u201cState of the Chains\u201d\nreport\n.\nThe pullback was driven by the city\u2019s biggest and most entrenched players. Seven of the 10 largest chains shrank their footprints, losing a combined 92 stores. Starbucks led the retreat, closing 42 locations since late last year, while longtime fixtures like Old Navy, Staples, Banana Republic, Duane Reade and GNC also posted notable declines, CUF found.\nEighteen retailers shut down all of their New York City locations this year, the highest total outside of the pandemic-era wave of closures in 2020, including Rite Aid, Party City, Rent-A-Center and Forever 21.\nThe contraction continues a longer reset. Nearly one in five chains tracked in CUF\u2019s 2019 report have since exited the city entirely. Of the 17 largest retailers operating six years ago, all but two have fewer stores today, a combined loss of more than 1,000 locations.\nCell phone stores, pharmacies and apparel chains have been hit hardest, reflecting the sustained drag of e-commerce and shifting consumer habits on traditional retail categories.\nStill, the data shows plenty of churn rather than a broad collapse: while 133 chains reduced their footprint over the past year, 114 added locations and 258 held steady. Dunkin\u2019 once again ranked as the city\u2019s largest chain and overtook Starbucks as Manhattan\u2019s top retailer, cementing its dominance across all five boroughs; Starbucks came in second, while Metro by T-Mobile ranked third.\nGrowth came overwhelmingly from food and beverage operators, which now account for a record 55.8 percent of all chain locations citywide. Fast-casual restaurants, bakeries, pizza chains and ice cream shops all posted gains, led by brands like Naya, Van Leeuwen, Maman, Wonder and 7th Street Burger expanding aggressively.\nFitness concepts also grew, led by Club Pilates, SLT and StretchLab.\nGeographically, every borough saw a net decline, but Queens stood out for resilience, losing only two stores and hosting six of the seven ZIP codes with the biggest gains.\nFor landlords and brokers, the takeaway is familiar: legacy chains are still retrenching, but demand hasn\u2019t disappeared; it\u2019s being reshuffled toward food and fitness\n",

        "content": "Oak Row Equities and Vlad Doronin\u2019s OKO Group teamed up to pay a record $520 million for Aimco\u2019s waterfront Brickell assemblage, with plans for a luxury hotel and residential project,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nOak Row, led by Erik Rutter and David Weitz, and OKO bought the 4.24-acre property consisting of the 32-story Brickell Bay Office Tower at 1001 Brickell Bay Drive and the adjacent 31-story, 357-unit Yacht Club Apartments at 1111 Brickell Bay Drive in Miami, according to the buyers\u2019 news release. Mariposa Real Estate partnered on the purchase.\nThe deal, which closed Tuesday, breaks down to $122.4 million per acre. It is the most expensive sale of a development site in South Florida.\nOak Row put the property\nunder contract\nfor $520 million a year ago, at the time announcing only Mariposa as its co-buyer. OKO\u2019s partnering on the deal likely came later. Throughout this year, Oak Row made the required periodic deposits, Aimco\u2019s filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission showed.\nTyko Capital, a joint venture between debt broker Adi Chugh and billionaire hedge funder Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Investment Management, provided $464.5 million senior loan for the purchase and predevelopment.\nThe developers plan to build a hotel and branded condos in the project\u2019s first phase, according to the release. It will join a crowded pipeline of branded residences in South Florida.\nThe tri-county region is the\nepicenter\nfor branded residential projects in North America, according to Knight Frank. As of last month, Miami had\n48 completed\nand 55 planned branded projects, second only to Dubai, according to Savills.\nBranded\nSouth Florida projects on tap include Edgardo Defortuna\u2019s Fortune International Group and Karmely\u2019s KAR Properties\nFaena Residences\non the Miami River, in partnership with Alan Faena; and Black Salmon, the Boschetti Group and Constellation Group\nHQ Residences Miami\nin Edgewater, in partnership with Sam Nazarian\u2019s HQ Hotels &amp; Residences by sbe. Marc Anthony is one of Nazarian\u2019s partners.\nOther projects are the\nRitz-Carlton\nin North Bay Village, a\nWaldorf Astoria\nunder construction in downtown Miami and a\nNobu\nin Brickell.\nThe Brickell property, which has 485 feet of Biscayne Bay frontage, can be developed by right with multiple supertalls totalling over 3 million square feet across property types. The tallest height allowed in Miami is 1,049 feet due to Federal Aviation Administration rules.\nDenver-based Aimco, which last month announced a\nvoluntary liquidation\namid a slower multifamily market, first listed the sites last year, with an asking price of about\n$650 million\n. The announcement of its dissolution came as Aimco, led by Wes Powell, was selling off properties nationwide.\nRobert Given and Troy Ballard led the CBRE team that marketed the Brickell sites.\nOak Row, which has offices in Miami and New York, is on a Miami development spree focused on luxury rentals. Its two Edgewater towers are the 41-story, 399-unit 2600 Biscayne with 187,000 square feet of commercial space, financed with a\n$181 million\nconstruction loan secured in March; and the 38-story, 324-unit 2900 Terrace tower, financed with a\n$210.5 million\nconstruction loan secured in June.\nOak Row and its partners this year completed the\nWynwood Plaza\nmixed-use project with a 509-unit apartment building and a 266,000-square-foot office building in Miami\u2019s Wynwood. Across from Brightline\u2019s MiamiCentral Station in downtown Miami, the firm also plans the First &amp; Fifth apartment tower, approved for\n526 units\n.\nOKO and London-based Cain International completed the 57-story\n830 Brickell\noffice tower in Miami last year, scoring a pre-leasing bonanza during the pandemic era influx of out-of-state companies to South Florida. Elsewhere, their projects include the 135-unit Una Residences condo tower in Brickell, and the 249-unit Missoni Baia condo tower in Edgewater. Doronin and Len Blavatnik started construction in August of\nAman Miami Beach\nwith hotel rooms and condos.\nLittle has been revealed in marketing materials about Mariposa. It appears tied to the Franklin family\u2019s Miami-based Mariposa Capital, led by Martin Franklin, who founded firms in the frozen food, chemicals and consumer goods industries. In 2022, Franklin bought a\nbig minority stake\nin the Casa Tua hospitality firm.\nThe Brickell site sale surpassed the biggest development site deal in South Florida to date. In 2022, billionaire hedge funder Ken Griffin paid\n$363 million\nfor a 2.5-acre bayfront Brickell lot where he plans a Citadel and Citadel Securities headquarters office tower and other uses. That deal equated to $145.2 million per acre, more than what Oak Row and OKO paid on a per acre basis.\nOak Row and OKO\u2019s total purchase price likely was more than what Griffin had paid because the Aimco assemblage includes income-producing office and apartment buildings.\n",

        "content": "South Florida\u2019s biggest hotel trades of 2025 were led by three nine-figure deals for waterfront and resort properties, as investors bet on continued strength in luxury leisure and Miami\u2019s urban hospitality market despite rising financing costs. The 10 largest sales totaled more than $960 million, with buyers ranging from institutional firms, global hotel investors, local developers and mission-driven nonprofits.\u200b The combined sales volume dipped significantly compared to last year when the\ntop 10 hotel deals of 2024\ncombined for $1.5 billion.\n1. $205M | Silver Sands Beach Resort | Key Biscayne\nDavid Martin\u2019s Coconut Grove-based Terra and Edgardo DeFortuna\u2019s Miami-based Fortune International Group splashed into Key Biscayne with the most expensive hotel purchase this year.\u00a0 The joint venture paid $205 million for the oceanfront Silver Sands Beach Resort at 301 Ocean Drive. The deal, which closed in April, also set a record price for a Key Biscayne development site sale. The developers plan on redeveloping the 50-room hotel into a 14-story boutique condominium with 56 units. An affiliate of Coral Gables-based Axis Development Corporation sold the 3.9-acre property. The price amounted to $52.6 million per acre.\n2. $204M | The Raleigh | Miami Beach\nThis year\u2019s second-biggest hotel sale was a major blow to developer Michael Shvo. In October, he was forced to sell the historic Art Deco hotel, on 3 acres at 1775 Collins Avenue, after he was unable to match a winning $204.1 million bid by private equity firm Nahla Capital, led by Genghis Hadi. Shvo had gutted the original buildings and secured approval for a 17-story luxury condo tower alongside the hotel on the beachfront site. But the project languished. The price amounted to $68 million per acre.\n3. $171M | PGA National Resort | Palm Beach Gardens\nThis transaction was part of a larger $400 million-plus deal in January involving an 807-acre property in Palm Beach Gardens. Henderson Park, Salamander Collection and South Street Partners paid $171.4 million for PGA National Resort at 400 Avenue of the Champions. Toronto-based Brookfield sold the 360-key resort and its golf and spa facilities. The courses were designed by golfing legends Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Tom Fazio, Andy Staples and Karl Litten. The price amounted to $475,000 per key.\n4. $148M | East Miami | Brickell\nBlackstone, led by Stephen Schwarzman, bought the EAST Miami hotel at 788 Brickell Plaza for $147.8 million in September. Trinity Investments and Certares sold the 40-story building for $26 million below the previous sale price in 2021. The 352-key hotel at 788 Brickell Plaza anchors the Brickell City Centre mixed-use complex originally developed by Swire. The price amounted to $420,000 per key.\n5. $99M | Moxy Miami | Wynwood\nIstanbul-based S\u00fczer Group, led by Sami \u00c7ak\u0131r and Vice Chairman Baran S\u00fczer, dropped $99 million for a majority stake in the MOXY Miami Wynwood in January. Seller DolphinBay Hospitality, a joint venture between Dolphin Capital Partners and Baywood Hotels, kept a 48 stake in the eight-story, 120-key building at 255 Northwest 25th Street. DolphinBay completed the Kobi Karp-designed hotel in 2024, five years after acquiring the 0.4-acre development site for $11 million.\n6. $44M | KImpton Angler\u2019s | Miami Beach\nFrench hotelier Philippe Le Guennec returned to Miami Beach with a big transaction this year. An entity managed by Le Guennec bought\u00a0 Kimpton Angler\u2019s Hotel in Miami Beach for $43.5 million this month. San Francisco-based KHP Capital Partners sold the 132-key building on a 1-acre site at 600 Washington Avenue. The trade breaks down to about $330,000 per room. Le Guennec, who owns 10 hotels in Paris, sold a 24-key Art Deco hotel in Miami Beach\u2019s South of Fifth neighborhood for $9 million in 2017.\n7. $37M | Plunge Beach Resort | Lauderdale-by-the-Sea\nIn July, T2 Hospitality, led by Mike Patel, acquired Plunge Beach Resort for $36.6 million. An entity managed by Oleksandr Naumyk and Liubov Tereshko sold the 163-room beachfront property consisting of a pair of two-story buildings and a five-story low-rise at 4660 North Ocean Drive. Newport Beach, California-based T2 Hospitality paid roughly $224,500 per key.\n8. $31M | Fairwind Hotel Miami | Miami Beach\nAn Art Deco property in South Beach sold at a discount in November. A joint venture between Tony Di Piazza and Private Exchange Group bought the Fairwind Hotel Miami at 1000 Collins Avenue for $31 million, $298,000 per key and 26 percent below the sale price four years ago. In 2021, seller Israel Katz paid $42 million for the 104-room low-rise building completed in 1936.\n9. $24M | Stadium Hotel | Miami Gardens\nAIDS Healthcare Foundation, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit led by Michael Weinstein, purchased Stadium Hotel in Miami Gardens for $24 million in August. The foundation paid all cash for the 217-room building at 21485 Northwest 27th Avenue in a deal that breaks down to $211,000 per key. An entity managed by David and William Ross sold the 3.9-acre site after months of marketing to hospitality, multifamily, assisted living and alternative-use investors. The buyer likely plans to convert the seven-story building into affordable housing for low-income residents living with HIV.\n10. $23M | Doral Inn &amp; Suites Miami Airport West | Doral\nRatia Real Estate Development bought the Doral Inn &amp; Suites Miami Airport West at 1212 Northwest 82nd Avenue in Doral for $23 million in October. An affiliate of Miami-based Qua Integral Services Real Estate sold the 112-key condo-hotel for roughly $205,000 per unit.",

        "content": "Chicago Public Schools blinked on a small but symbolically charged property tax increase, as the city\u2019s broader budget fight reached a boiling point.\nChicago Board of Education President Sean Harden quietly pulled a resolution last week that would have allowed CPS to squeeze an additional $25 million from property owners this year, backing away from a move the district has made annually for more than a decade, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. The measure was set for a vote at last week\u2019s board meeting and would have pushed the district\u2019s levy to the maximum allowed under state law.\nHarden, a mayoral appointee tapped last year by Brandon Johnson to lead the hybrid, partially elected school board, said Monday the decision had nothing to do with\nCity Hall\npolitics. Instead, he told the outlet that the pullback stemmed from \u201coutstanding questions\u201d among board members about the levy itself.\nStill, the timing was hard to miss. The maneuver landed squarely in the middle of Johnson\u2019s high-stakes\nbudget showdown\nwith the\nCity Council\n, where the mayor has cast himself as a bulwark against rising taxes \u2014 particularly on working-class homeowners.\nWhile $25 million is a rounding error in\nCPS\u2019 budget\n, the stakes stretch beyond this year. Property tax hikes are cumulative, meaning skipping the increase permanently lowers the district\u2019s baseline. If CPS ultimately passes on the extra levy authority, it would mark the first time since 2009 that the district failed to raise taxes to the legal limit, according to the Tribune.\nThe district isn\u2019t exactly flush. CPS closed a $729 million budget gap this summer through layoffs and service cuts and still carries billions in long-term debt. Its financial plan leans heavily on $522 million in tax increment financing revenue, boosted by Johnson\u2019s push to declare a record $1 billion TIF surplus.\nProperty taxes remain CPS\u2019 largest and most reliable revenue source. The August budget already baked in a 2.9 percent levy increase, or $232.5 million, from last year. Any further bump would have landed on homeowners already reeling from a 16.7 percent jump in median property tax bills across Chicago, according to the publication.\nThe board could still revive the proposal at a special meeting before the Dec. 29 deadline to finalize the levy.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Local brokerage Team Price Real Estate reported that metro area condo inventory hit a record 4,240 units in December, more than double the supply from three years earlier. At the same time, prices have slid. The median\ncondo sale price\nfell to $337,500 in November, down from a peak of about $470,000 in April 2022.\nLuminary isn\u2019t alone. Across Austin,\nmultifamily towers\n, office projects and mixed-use developments have been delayed, resized or rethought, amid elevated vacancies, higher construction costs and lingering questions about long-term space demand from tech and other white-collar employers. Slower\nin-migration\nhas only added to the pressure, according to the publication.\nNorthland Living first unveiled plans for Luminary in January 2024, pitching a 354,616-square-foot tower designed by Page Southerland Page. A year later, the developer refined the concept to roughly 280 condos, ranging from 600 square feet to 2,700 square feet, along with ground-floor retail and a single level of office space. Prices were expected to start around $499,000 and climb above $3 million, with about half of the units priced below $1 million. Urbanspace is handling marketing and sales.\nThe site, which measures less than an acre, is currently occupied by two low-rise buildings, one housing the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, which is slated to relocate into the new tower\u2019s office space when \u2014 or if \u2014 the project moves forward. Northland has secured a site development permit that runs through July 2028, giving it a long runway to restart construction.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A failed luxury home deal on Wisconsin\u2019s Geneva Lake spilled into court, with the seller of a storied estate accusing a deep-pocketed Chicago buyer of tying up the property and blowing a $15 million hole in its value.\nThe Harold B. Smith Foundation sued financier and former pharmaceutical executive Jack McGinley, alleging that his $37.5 million offer to buy Aloha Lodge in Lake Geneva was binding, and that his eventual walkaway cost the estate crucial market momentum. The lawsuit, filed earlier this month in Lake County, Wisconsin, claims breach of contract and breach of good faith and fair dealing and seeks unspecified damages, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n.\nAloha Lodge\n, a roughly 20,000-square-foot mansion on the south shore of Lake Geneva, which sits on 12 acres at 768 South Lake Shore Drive, ultimately sold in August 2024 for $21.9 million \u2014 far below both its original\n$35 million\nasking price and McGinley\u2019s offer. The foundation contends that McGinley\u2019s conduct forced that outcome. LSV Asset Management\u2019s James Owens was the buyer.\nAccording to the complaint, McGinley and his wife, Julie, executed a written offer in May 2023 to buy the estate for $37.5 million, which the foundation accepted the next day. Afterward, the suit alleges, McGinley sought information about other showings and competing bids and asked the seller to delay updating the multiple listing service to reflect an accepted offer. The foundation says the maneuver stalled activity and chilled interest in the property.\nComplicating matters, McGinley suffered a pulmonary embolism during the attorney review period, requiring emergency hospitalization. The foundation claims it was advised such a medical event could justify terminating a contract, but alleges McGinley instead used the moment to seek revised terms \u2014 including a delayed closing, a new health-related walkaway provision and a due diligence clause tied to renovation plans. No earnest money was ever delivered, the suit alleges, and McGinley ultimately abandoned the deal.\nMcGinley\u2019s attorney, John Ruskusky, flatly disputes that any binding contract existed. In a statement to the Tribune, Ruskusky said the offer was subject to attorney review, that McGinley requested reasonable changes the seller failed to address, and that the proposal became null and void by its own terms. He also cited McGinley\u2019s medical emergency as a factor in his decision not to proceed.\nAloha Lodge has deep\nChicago ties\n. The Southern colonial-style mansion was built in about 1900 for Tracy Drake, co-founder of the Drake and Blackstone hotels. Harold B. Smith, a longtime Illinois Tool Works executive, bought the property in 1998 and undertook a major renovation before his death in 2022. His foundation, formed in 2018, inherited the estate and listed it in 2023.\nThe lawsuit also points to a parallel deal gone sideways. About the same time as the Lake Geneva negotiations, McGinley had a contract to buy another foundation-owned estate in Palm Beach for $38 million, a deal he also exited. That property later sold for $29.3 million.\nThe foundation said accepting a lower price for Aloha Lodge directly harmed the nonprofit organizations it supports, including the Newberry Library and\nRush University System\nfor Health. Ruskusky rejected claims that McGinley has a pattern of breaching contracts, calling him a \u201chighly reputable\u201d buyer with a long track record of successful deals.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation long vowed to buy or build\naffordable housing\nand hold onto the properties in perpetuity \u2014 a commitment it is now poised to break.\nThe nonprofit landlord plans to put four\nTenderloin\n-area buildings on the market, which would mark the first asset sales in its history as the organization works to stabilize its balance sheet, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. The\nnonprofit\nhas not disclosed expected asking prices and is soliciting broker proposals to market the assets either individually or as a package, with listings expected in January.\nThe soon-to-be-for-sale properties include the Dalt Hotel at 34 Turk Street, the West Hotel at 141 Eddy Street, Civic Center Residences at 44 McAllister Street and 270 Turk Street, which the nonprofit acquired in 2019 specifically to preserve long-term affordability. Together, the properties contain 581 units serving formerly homeless residents, seniors and tenants with health or substance abuse issues.\nJennifer Dolin, CEO of the Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation, framed the decision as a necessary \u201cpivot\u201d to preserve the rest of the organization\u2019s more than 50-building portfolio.\n\u201cLike any real estate holding company, there are risks\u2026 and unfortunately, the headwinds and what\u2019s happened to us as a society has just made it impossible for us to keep pace,\u201d Dolin said. \u201cWe find ourselves in this really unfortunate and difficult position where we have to explore all possibilities.\u201d\nThe buildings are contending with vacancy rates between 12 and 22 percent, the Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation said. About 175 permanent\nsupportive housing\ntenants live in 183 units and receive rent subsidies and access to on-site services, while other apartments are capped for households earning up to 50 percent of area median income. City tenant protections generally prevent resident displacement during a sale. It remains unclear whether all affordability restrictions would remain intact over the long term as units turn over.\nThe strain on the Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation\u2019s portfolio is affecting its development work as well. The organization is pausing two of its major construction efforts: a 199-unit senior housing project at 1234 Great Highway and a 120-unit affordable housing project at 149 Pennsylvania Street, Katie Lamont, COO for the nonprofit, said.\nThe sales by Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation could be an early warning sign for San Francisco\u2019s affordable housing sector.\nTenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation \u201cis the canary in the coal mine,\u201d Malcolm Yeung, executive director of local nonprofit landlord San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown Community Development Corporation, told the Chronicle. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a \u2018them\u2019 thing; it\u2019s a \u2018we\u2019 thing.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Kingston was the first upstate municipality to adopt rent stabilization in New York, but it\u2019s becoming a symbol of how challenges to the designation remain strong.\nThis week, Mayor Steve Noble vetoed a Common Council resolution to maintain rent stabilization in the city, the Times Union\nreported\n. The Common Council\u2019s resolution from last week to declare a housing emergency was unanimous, setting up a clash and potential veto override.\nData disputes are driving the debacle. A city vacancy study found rates in buildings covered by the Emergency Tenant Protection Act at 7.04 percent\nthis spring\n, above a 5 percent limit required to declare a \u201chousing emergency\u201d and keep rent caps in place. But the Council pointed to a 4.55 percent citywide vacancy rate.\nNoble said the Common Council\u2019s resolution, which cites the 4.55 percent vacancy rate determined by an independent consultant hired by the city\u2019s Office of Housing Initiatives, \u201cmisconstrues aspects of the 2025 vacancy study and contains several factual errors.\u201d Namely, the city\u2019s report did not calculate a city-wide vacancy rate and the consultant only analyzed nine properties for its study.\nLast August, the state\u2019s Court of Appeals\nrejected\na challenge from the Hudson Valley Property Owners Association, which argued the city\u2019s 2022 vacancy study was flawed and that its Rent Guidelines Board overreached by ordering a 15 percent rent rollback in stabilized buildings, allowing the reduction to stand and opening the door for tenants to seek refunds.\nThe 2022 and 2025 city vacancy studies did have different methodologies, though. The recent city survey differed in its approach, using \u201ctargeted sampling\u201d that excluded some large complexes.\nKingston\u2019s ETPA initially covered 64 buildings and 1,200 apartments; exemptions and rehab projects have cut that to fewer than 1,000 units, under 20 percent of the city\u2019s rentals.\nCouncil members can adjust which buildings qualify \u2014 for instance, covering only those with 22-plus units \u2014 but can\u2019t expand eligibility beyond ETPA\u2019s pre-1974, six-unit minimum. A compromise deal with that unit threshold in mind is on the table, but has not been pursued.\nCouncil members and tenant advocates slammed the mayor\u2019s veto \u2014 which can be overruled with a two-thirds majority \u2014 while the director of a landlord group supported the move.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A private country club in South Florida has become an epicenter of high-stakes global diplomacy.\nDelegations from at least nine nations convened over the weekend at Shell Bay Club, the ultra-exclusive Hallandale Beach club co-owned by developer Steve Witkoff, for parallel negotiations on the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, according to\nAxios\n.\nWitkoff\n, who joined President Donald Trump\u2019s administration in January as the president\u2019s lead negotiator on both conflicts, has used Shell Bay as an off-the-record meeting ground for world leaders and envoys. While based part-time in Washington, he has reportedly flown at his own expense to European and Middle Eastern capitals to advance talks on the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and on Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\nShell Bay\u2019s luxury and privacy has proven convenient for discreet discussions far from the scrutiny of Washington and the international media. The members-only club, which opened in 2023 with reported initiation fees exceeding $1 million, sits about an hour south of Trump\u2019s home, the private Palm Beach club Mar-a-Lago, and a short drive north of Miami Beach.\nWitkoff\u2019s eponymous firm is leading a handful of major projects in South Florida, including the redevelopment of the\nShore Club\nArt Deco hotel property in Miami Beach, and developing\nOcean Terrace\n, a project in the same city that entails a condo-hotel and a renovated historic hotel.\nWitkoff and Ocean Terrace partner, Len Blavatnik\u2019s Access Real Estate, also own a 200-acre mixed-use development site in West Palm Beach that includes the\nBanyan Cay Resort &amp; Golf Club\n. Witkoff sold his stake in his company for\n$120 million\nin September.\nShell Bay\u2019s role in global affairs traces back to the drafting of Trump\u2019s first Ukraine peace proposal in November, when Witkoff and\nJared Kushner\n, the president\u2019s son-in-law, hosted Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev. Weeks later, Ukrainian national security adviser Rustem Umerov flew to South Florida to review the plan. Subsequent rounds of talks brought U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, European national security chiefs, and Middle Eastern officials to the same club grounds.\nThis past weekend\u2019s meetings reportedly involved separate sessions for Ukraine and Gaza peace efforts. U.S. envoys met European, Ukrainian and Russian representatives across three days.\nMeanwhile, the Qatari prime minister, Egypt\u2019s intelligence chief and Turkey\u2019s foreign minister met with Witkoff and Kushner to coordinate the next steps of the Gaza deal, including establishing a new Palestinian governing body.\n\u2014 Francisco Alvarado",

        "content": "MGR Real Estate\nhas added an office park in Orange to its Orange County holdings.\nThe Ontario, California-based firm purchased the Orange City Square business center at 750, 770, 790 and 840 The City Drive for $89 million, the Orange County Business Journal\nreported\n. The seller was Texas-based Granite Properties, L.A. Business First\nreported\n.\nThe property boasts Class A office space and retail \u201cpositioned directly adjacent to a major medical and institutional employment hub [at the University of California, Irvine Medical Center],\u201d Michael G. Rademaker, founder and CEO of MGR Real Estate, said.\nIt\u2019s the latest sale in the area near the Outlets at Orange shopping center, situated across the Garden Grove Freeway from Orange City Square.\nEarlier this month, an affiliate of Astiva Health\npaid $23 million\nfor a 10-story office building at 600 City Parkway. It bought the 204,000-square-foot property, currently about 50 percent vacant and leased mostly to healthcare tenants, from an affiliate of Greenlaw Partners. Over the summer, Newport Beach-based\nSurlamer Investments bought\nthe 19-story, 369,134-square-foot City Plaza office building in Orange County from TPG Capital for $18.5 million.\nMGR is no stranger to Orange County.\nLast year, the company picked up a 12-story, 271,100-square-foot office tower at\n2020 Main Street\nin Irvine for $53.7 million. The seller in that transaction was Prudential Financial real estate subsidiary PGIM. Hankey Capital provided MGR with a $33 million loan to buy the offices, which were 44 percent occupied at the time of the sale.\nThe year prior, MGR acquired the Canvas creative office campus in Costa Mesa for $91.5 million. The complex comprises 553,530 square feet across five buildings on an 11.3-acre property near the South Coast Plaza mall.\nRademaker founded his Ontario-headquartered firm in 1983.

        "content": "The city of San Jose has given the green light to the development of two twin housing towers in the heart of downtown.\nCity planning administrators approved a proposal from Westbank to build two towers at 35 South Second Street for a total of 768 residential units, the Mercury News\nreported\n. The location is currently home to a parking lot.\nOne tower will rise 28 stories and the other will be 27 stories tall. The two-tower housing project will also have 10,700 square feet of ground-floor retail,\u00a0 26,100 square feet of space for residential lobbies and amenities and four levels of underground parking. The residences will include landscaped balconies and alternating outdoor rooms and balconies. Rooftop terraces are also part of Westbank\u2019s vision for the buildings.\nThe approval answers a yearslong question about what Westbank would ultimately end up building on the site. In 2021, the Vancouver-based Westbank proposed building a single\n750,000-square-foot curving tower\nwith 368,000 square feet of office space on 10 floors and 194 residences on another 10 floors.\nIt\u2019s not the first project in\ndowntown San Jose where Westbank has pivoted\nfrom offices to housing as demand for office space lags.\nIn August, the firm submitted revised plans for 391 housing units next to a data center at 180 Park Avenue as part of Westbank\u2019s Park Habitat development.\nIn October 2024, Westbank unveiled its proposal for three\n30-story housing towers\nwith 1,147 units at 300 South First Street and 345 South Second Street. A few months before that, Westbank swapped out an approved plan for a 14-story office building at 255 West Julian Street in downtown San Jose for an\n18-story residential tower\n.\nWestbank is also in development on a 17-story apartment highrise at 23 Terraine Street in downtown San Jose. That proposal calls for an apartment tower on 1.6 acres with 12,000 square feet of ground-floor shops and restaurants as well as a nine-story parking garage for 621 vehicles.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A Colorado investor is doubling down on Dallas offices, snapping up one of the largest buildings along the North Central Expressway at a steep discount that highlights just how far values have fallen.\nDenver-based Real Capital Solutions acquired Walnut Glen, an 18-story, class-A office tower at 8144 Walnut Hill Lane, for $26.1 million, the firm announced on Monday. The Dallas Morning News\nreported\nthat the deal pencils out to a more than 64 percent discount from the building\u2019s 2016 sale price of $73 million.\nThe 464,000-square-foot building is about 49 percent leased, according to the broker, JLL, and equates to about $56 per square foot. That vacancy, combined with broader distress in the office sector, has helped reset pricing even for large, well located buildings. For tax purposes, the Dallas Central Appraisal District still values the tower at $72.2 million.\nIntercontinental\nReal Estate Corporation of Boston owned the property for nearly a decade after buying it from a local investment group. Built in the late 1980s, Walnut Glen is a familiar presence along the freeway, anchored by a massive glass atrium facing North Central Expressway.\nReal Capital Solutions\nplans a value-add strategy. The\nfirm\nsaid it will invest heavily in upgrades to the lobby, fitness center and conference center and roll out move-in-ready office suites aimed at attracting tenants seeking shorter decision timelines and turnkey space. The company declined to disclose the size of its capital commitment to the outlet, but described it as substantial.\nAdam Abeln, Real Capital Solutions\u2019 chief acquisitions officer, said in a statement that the tower \u201cchecks every box\u201d in terms of what the firm is looking for in a purchase to create value, such as its scale and location.\nThe acquisition marks the firm\u2019s second Dallas office play in under a year. Last December, Real Capital Solutions bought\nTower at Park Lane\n\u2014 another North Central Expressway property \u2014 for $66 million, a signal that the firm is concentrating its Texas bets along the same high-visibility corridor.\nThat conviction isn\u2019t entirely contrarian. Dallas-Fort Worth is leading the nation in office demand, outpacing markets like New York and Houston, according to recent CoStar data. Net absorption totaled 3.3 million square feet through the third quarter, or about 0.8 percent of total inventory \u2014 the highest share in the country. Traditional office leasing in Dallas-Fort Worth is on track for its strongest year since 2019, according to the CoStar report.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A Democratic Socialist for mayor. Three casinos. New rules for residential brokers. The demise of member deference.\n2025 was a consequential year of political and policy shifts that will affect the real estate industry.\nThe big one, obviously, is that New York City will have\na new mayor\ncome January 1. Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani wasn\u2019t the first or even second choice for many in the industry. In fact, many\nrallied\nbehind former Gov. Andrew Cuomo ahead of the June primary, pouring millions of dollars into political action committees backing his campaign.\nWhen Cuomo lost, some\njumped ship\nto Mayor Eric Adams, hoping he could gain momentum after\nescaping\nfederal corruption charges. But as polls showed him in\nfourth place\n(behind Republican Curtis Sliwa) and charges continued to pile up against his\ninner circle\n, he\ndropped\nout of the race in September.\nSome in the industry have\nfound hope\nin Mamdani\u2019s commitment to building more housing and to exploring ways to reduce costs for landlords, including through potential property tax reform and alternative insurance methods. Still, owners are wary of this pledge to freeze rents for stabilized tenants for four years. That promise may be complicated by Adams\u2019\nlast-minute appointments\nto the Rent Guidelines Board, though Mamdani will be able to replace all of the Adams appointees in 2027.\nTwo weeks before the primary, the Fairness in Apartment Rental Expenses, or FARE, Act\nwent into effect\n. The law transformed how residential rental brokers work in the city, requiring whoever hires brokers to pay their commission. The Real Estate Board of New York\nfiled a lawsuit\nchallenging the law soon after its passage, alleging that it violates the First Amendment rights of brokers and landlords because it discourages the publishing of rental listings. The group has an\nappeal\nof a federal court\u2019s dismissal of that claim pending before the Second Circuit.\nIn last year\u2019s\nend-of-year newsletter\n, I said 2024 was a big year for Yimbys. This year also included some major wins for pro-housing folks. Voters approved four\nhousing-related ballot measures\n, three of which allow certain projects to either bypass City Council approval or appeal rejections from the body. The changes do not completely kill member deference (the City Council tradition of voting on land-use issues according to the wishes of the local member), but weaken it considerably. The creation of an appeals board also\nelevates\nthe role borough presidents play in zoning approvals.\nThis will be a dynamic we\u2019ll be following closely, as well as the further rollout of City of Yes for Housing Opportunity, the federal government\u2019s\nexpansion of low-income housing tax credits\nand how all of these initiatives affect the volume of development.\nMeanwhile, on their way out the door, City Council members approved several bills that some see as the Council\u2019s way of reasserting its authority over housing policy following the approval of the ballot measures. The Council approved a\npackage of housing bills\nthat set new rules for the kinds of housing the city finances. One of the bills creates minimum wages for construction workers on certain projects.\nThe Council also approved the\nCommunity Opportunity to Purchase Act, or COPA\n, which gives city-approved nonprofits and joint ventures first dibs on buying distressed multifamily buildings. Landlord groups have warned that the measure will slow down deals and scare away potential investors.\nThe mayor has called the measures\nshortsighted\n, but it\u2019s not clear if he will veto the bills.\nIf the bills become law, housing groups have warned that they will add millions of dollars to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development\u2019s budget needs or will result in thousands of fewer housing units being built each year.\nThis year also saw the conclusion of the years-long competition for three downstate casino licenses. Community Advisory Committees eliminated half of the competitors, and after MGM Resorts\ndropped\nits bid to turn its Yonkers facility into a full-blown casino, only three proposals were left to vie for the up to three state licenses available. The state Gaming Commission\nagreed\nto issue licenses to Steve Cohen\u2019s Metropolitan Park, Bally\u2019s Golf Links at Ferry Point and Resorts World\u2019s Queens Aqueduct.\nWe\u2019ll be watching the progress of these projects \u2014\u00a0and the various\npromises\nmade by the casino teams \u2014\u00a0over the next year.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: Speaking of things we\u2019re watching: President Donald Trump\nmet with\nMayor-elect Zohran Mamdani in November, and the two highlighted multiple points of agreement, including the need for more housing. In fact, Trump said of the incoming mayor: \u201cI think you\u2019re going to have, hopefully, a really great mayor. I expect to be helping him, not hurting him.\u201d Will this sentiment last? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Wild horses in Australia are called brumbies.\nProgramming note:\nThe newsletter is taking a break from Dec. 24 until Jan. 5. Thank you for reading, and have a safe and happy holiday!\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Council member Erik Bottcher announced on Monday that he will not run to replace Rep. Jerrold Nadler in the 12th Congressional District,\nCity &amp; State reports.\nInstead, he plans to run for Brad Hoylman-Sigal\u2019s state Senate seat. (Hoylman-Sigal is leaving the state legislature to become Manhattan borough president.)\n\u2014 Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani on Tuesday tapped Lillian Bonsignore as the next commissioner of the Fire Department of New York. Bonsignore previously served as the FDNY\u2019s chief of EMS operations.\n\u2014 In a groundbreaking ceremony that was more of an announcement of when to expect an actual groundbreaking, city and state officials on Tuesday said demolition work on the future site of the Science Park and Research Campus (SPARC) in Kips Bay will begin in February 2026. Construction of the campus is slated to begin in 2027.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$28.5 million\nfor a 9,704-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium at 50 United Nations Plaza in Turtle Bay. The Zeckendorf Marketing team had the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$28 million\nfor a 42,592-square-foot industrial property at 75 Onderdonk Avenue in Maspeth.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$4 million\nfor a 3,720-square-foot, two-family home at 308 Clermont Avenue in Fort Greene. Ari Harkov, Christian George Emanuel and Warner Lewis with Brown Harris Stevens have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 20,185-square-foot, eight-story residential building at 3822 Sedgwick Avenue in Kingsbridge Heights. Nikolai Katz filed the permit on behalf of Sinai Gross.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

        "content": "A dispute between an investor and the special servicer on a loan has spilled out into court.\nSpecial servicer Rialto Capital Advisors is being sued for allegedly trying to keep a borrower unnecessarily in default, a situation that would result in more fees earned by the servicer but would sting other loan certificateholders. The investment firm 400 Capital Management, an investor on the loan, filed the suit in New York on Tuesday.\nIt\u2019s the latest legal challenge for one of the nation\u2019s largest special servicers by volume. As of June, Rialto was the named special servicer on more than 5,000 loans with a total unpaid principal of more than $94 billion, according to Morningstar. About $24 billion of that principal is associated with loans in active special servicing. The plaintiffs are asking a judge to restrain the servicer from acting on its plan.\n\u201cThis is totally outside the norm of what\u2019s expected in the industry,\u201d Daniel Hendler, an attorney for the plaintiff with McKool Smith, said of Rialto\u2019s proposal.\nAt the center of the complaint is a piece of Herald Square real estate, 215 West 34th Street and 218 West 35th Street. The borrower, associated with Jenel Real Estate, took out $130 million on the property in 2015.\nThe loan is set to mature January 6, 2026. But the borrower hasn\u2019t been able to refinance and get the funds needed to pay off its debt. That\u2019s in part because two key tenants will see their leases expire in the next two years.\nThe loan was sent to special servicing in October and then missed a payment in November. But the property is stable, the plaintiff says. Net operating income is more than double its debt service payments, the property is fully leased and has about $6 million in annual excess cash flow.\n\u201cIt\u2019s highly improper for Rialto to treat a performing loan as being in default,\u201d the complaint reads.\nRialto has proposed extending the loan by two years, with an option for a third year. Although this would typically be considered a loan modification, 400 Capital wrote in its complaint, Rialto has allegedly proposed calling the agreement a \u201cforbearance agreement.\u201d That would keep the loan in special servicing with Rialto, allowing the servicer to collect more in fees and nearly $10 million in default interest on top of regular payments, according to the complaint.\n400 Capital argues Rialto\u2019s plan is unusual in that it would allow the servicer to essentially cut the line \u2014 privileging payouts to itself, like servicing fees and default interest, over payments toward the principal.\n\u201cWhat a special servicer really should do in the case of a distressed loan is manage it in a way that will maximize the recovery of the loan for the trust that it services,\u201d Hendler said. In this case, he said, that would mean taking the excess cash flow to pay down the principal of the loan, increasing its creditworthiness.\n\u201cInstead, what Rialto is proposing to do with that excess cash flow is put it in its pocket,\u201d Hendler said.\nRialto did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, in a letter to the plaintiff provided in court exhibits, the servicer said it\u2019s entitled to the default interest by its agreements. Its plan would also mean excess cash would be kept in an account and out of the borrower\u2019s hands, meaning more security for the loan.\nRialto, through its investment affiliate Rialto Capital Management, is the country\u2019s\nlargest buyer of CMBS B-piece notes\n. Those notes give the investor the ability to select the special servicer on the loan, including selecting its own affiliate.\nThe servicer has gained a reputation for aggressive techniques. New York landlords who borrowed from the since-collapsed Signature Bank have accused the company of \u201cunlawfully manufacturing\u201d defaults,\nThe Real Deal reported earlier this year\n.\nThe company has responded that it is playing by the rules, only exercising rights in rare cases, and remains committed to borrowers.",

        "content": "Coral Rock Development Group scored a $54 million construction loan for a Live Local Act project in Miami\u2019s\nAllapattah\n.\nDevelopers across South Florida have seized on the state workforce and affordable housing law by filing a flurry of proposals, but few have advanced their projects to the financing and construction stage.\nCoral Gables-based Coral Rock plans to start construction in the first quarter on the eight-story, 227-unit Dulce Vida apartment building on a 1.3-acre site at 1785 Northwest 35th Street, according to the developer\u2019s news release. Citibank is the lender.\nThe capital stack for the $85 million project includes $15 million from the City of Miami\u2019s Miami Forever Affordable Housing Bond,\u00a0 structured as a 30-year loan, and tax credit equity provided by Affordable Housing Partners. The Citibank debt represents 63.5 percent of the project cost.\nThe\nLive Local Act\n, approved in 2023 and tweaked in the subsequent two years, incentivizes developers to include below-market rate apartments in their projects by allowing them to build bigger than a site\u2019s zoning permits and awarding them property tax abatements. At least 40 percent of units have to be reserved for households earning up to 120 percent of the area median income for at least 30 years.\nAt Dulce Vida, all apartments will be priced at affordable or workforce rents: 40 percent of units will be for households earning up to 60 percent of the AMI, 35 percent for those earning up to 100 percent of the AMI and 25 percent for earners of up to 120 percent of AMI, according to the release. The building will consist of 70 studios, 128 one-bedroom units and 29 two-bedroom units.\nThe site is now home to a parking lot and the Allapattah Branch Library. Dulce Vida will include an 8,500-square-foot library, replacing one that was completed in 1963. The City of Miami, which owned the property, conveyed title to Coral Rock, according to a company representative.\nThe firm \u2013\u2013 led by\u00a0 David Brown, Michael Wohl, Stephen Blumenthal and Victor Brown \u2013\u2013 first revealed plans for\nDulce Vida\nin 2023.\nCoral Rock is among the developers who\ntapped\nthe Live Local Act for tax breaks on completed apartment buildings. Many started construction or completed projects before the law was passed, and then converted a portion of their units to workforce-priced rentals to obtain the property tax abatements. The savings have been well-received as landlords face higher costs for insurance, management and unit renovations.\nCoral Rock lowered rents for some apartments at the 204-unit Metropolitan in Coral Springs to get Live Local tax abatements. It also qualified the 260-unit\nPura Vida\ncomplex in Hialeah, though it didn\u2019t have to lower rents because they already were at rates for earners of up to 120 percent of the AMI.\nAmong other advanced Live Local projects are Beacon Hill Property Group\u2019s 112-unit complex in Princeton, and Daniel Abreu\u2019s 80-unit building near North Miami that scored a\n$16.5 million\nconstruction loan last year.\u00a0Nearly\n3,200 below-market rental units\nin 23 Live Local projects have been completed across Florida since the law was approved, according to Florida TaxWatch, a nonpartisan and nonprofit research institute.\n",

        "content": "A sprawling Chicagoland apartment complex with a history as a chocolate factory once again traded since its last sale two years ago.\nDallas-based\nS2 Capital\n, a real estate investment manager, said it paid $93.7 million for the Ovaltine Court apartment complex, a 344-unit garden and loft-style multifamily community in Villa Park, a western suburb of Chicago. It marks the firm\u2019s first investment in the greater Chicago area, according to a press release.\nS2 funded the acquisition with a $60 million loan from Starwood Capital. The purchase price breaks down to $273,256 per apartment.\nS2 paid 29 percent more than the complex\u2019s last sale price In 2023, when San Francisco-based Stockbridge Capital sold it to New York-based\nOsso Capital for $73.1 million\n, as previously reported by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nStockbridge, for its part, purchased the apartments a decade earlier for $58 million and spent $1.6 million on upgrades in that time period, records show.\nOsso, led by former Blackstone executive Olivia John, also invested in the complex, funneling $785,000 in improvements and upgrades since 2024, according to a JLL marketing brochure.\nOriginally converted in 2001 from the historic Ovaltine Chocolate Factory that was built in 1917, the complex features loft-style layouts, 9-foot to 15-foot ceiling heights, and architectural character rarely found in suburban Chicago, according to the release.\nThe Ovaltine factory was the centerpiece of economic activity in Villa Park until it closed in 1985. The community is in DuPage County, a supply-constrained submarket with no new multifamily units currently under construction.\nMonthly rents at the Ovaltine Court range from $2,000 to $2,800, and the complex has maintained average occupancy above 95 percent since Osso stepped in, JLL\u2019s marketing brochure states.\nS2\u2019s acquisition\nis a major foray into the U.S. market, following several years of evaluation and underwriting across the Chicago region, according to the release.\nCole Stephens, S2 Capital\u2019s managing director of asset management, residential, said in a statement that demand drivers such as the apartments\u2019 historic character and tight rental market were among the reasons for the purchase.\nWork is still needed on the complex. About 98 percent of the units remain unrenovated or only partially upgraded, providing S2 with the opportunity to \u201cexecute a comprehensive renovation program aimed at driving rental growth and enhancing resident experience,\u201d according to the release.\nFounded in 2012, S2 has acquired more than 51,000 units nationwide with deals totaling more than $13 billion, the release shows. The purchase was made through\nS2\u2019s fully discretionary\nclosed-end fund, S2 Real Estate Fund II.\nInvestors have poured roughly $4.8 billion into Chicago-area multifamily properties this year, already surpassing 2024\u2019s full-year total of $3.9 billion, and marking the strongest volume since $5.9 billion traded in 2022, according to CoStar data.\n",

        "content": "The price tag for saving Houston\u2019s most iconic building just got a lot harder to ignore.\nA new Harris County Sports &amp; Convention Corporation-commissioned study estimates it would cost more than $752 million to bring the Astrodome back to basic working order \u2014 compared to about $55 million to knock it down. The Houston Business Journal\nreported\nthat the analysis puts fresh numbers behind a debate that\u2019s lingered for years.\nThe study found that renovating the\nAstrodome\nto \u201cbasic operational functionality\u201d \u2014 stopping short of full historic preservation or modern venue upgrades \u2014 would run about $752.6 million. Demolition, by contrast, would cost roughly $55 million, covering teardown and debris removal while leaving the below-grade structure untouched until a future use is determined.\n\u201cThese cost estimates illustrate that it will not be financially feasible for Harris County to renovate the Astrodome without significant private investment,\u201d interim County Administrator Jesse Dickerman said in a statement.\nThe timing is no accident. HCSCC approved the study amid ongoing, high-stakes lease negotiations at\nNRG Park\nwith the Houston Texans and the\nHouston Livestock Show and Rodeo\n, whose agreements both expire in 2032. The fate of the long-shuttered Dome is a central piece of those talks, though county officials said there\u2019s no timeline for a final decision.\nHouston-based\nKirksey Architecture\nprepared the analysis, which was expanded last November and delayed beyond its original early-2025 delivery. That expansion drew sharp criticism from the Astrodome Conservancy, the nonprofit pushing to repurpose the structure, according to the publication. The group blasted the county for spending more public dollars on demolition scenarios, arguing the Dome\u2019s status as a protected Texas landmark warrants a more aggressive reuse strategy.\nThe conservancy has its own numbers. In November, it unveiled a $840 million vision to convert the Astrodome into a mixed-use complex with an arena, retail and multiple buildings inside the existing shell. The plan hinges on a public-private partnership, with $270 million in public funds for the arena and roughly $570 million from private capital for commercial components. Historic tax credits could offset up to 45 percent of the total cost, according to the organization.\nPublic opinion appears to tilt toward reuse. A University of Houston survey last summer found 62 percent of Harris County voters support using public funds as part of a public-private partnership to redevelop the Astrodome into an entertainment and mixed-use destination.\nBut support from key stakeholders is missing. Neither HCSCC, the Texans nor Rodeo Houston has endorsed the conservancy\u2019s proposal, and Rodeo Houston has been openly skeptical. CEO Chris Boleman told the outlet NRG Park\u2019s broader needs are \u201ca $1 billion problem\u201d that goes well beyond the Dome itself, and that the rodeo simply doesn\u2019t use the Astrodome.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Dallas is the king of ultra-luxury homes in Texas. Most of the top residential sales statewide this year \u2014\nthe public deals, at least\n\u2014 took place within a few square miles around Southern Methodist University.\nThis year, though, a market shift throughout the\nSun Belt\narrested the ascent that Texas metros have enjoyed since the pandemic. While Texas is a non-disclosure state, it came to light this month that the top two residential sales of the year, both in Dallas, sold below asking price, raising questions about the cheaper homes on the list.\nMeanwhile, suburban Plano made its way into the ranking, challenging the reign that Preston Hollow and the Park Cities have held over Texas luxury sales for years.\nHere are the year\u2019s top 10 public residential deals in the Metroplex.\n6601 Hunters Glen Road, Dallas | $30.5 million\nThis University Park home\nwasn\u2019t just the most expensive sale in Dallas-Fort Worth; it was the most expensive sale in Texas, according to listing agent Alex Perry with Allie Beth Allman and Associates and the Houston Association of Realtors. It\u2019s also the oldest home and one of the fastest sales on this list.\nNotably, the home\u2019s final sale price of $30.5 million was $4.5 million below the\noriginal asking price of $35 million\n, Perry disclosed.\nThe University Park mansion built in 1927 went under contract in just 30 days after\nlisting\non Oct. 31. The sale closed on Dec. 15. The seller was a trust connected to the late Josh Pack, the Fortress Investment Group CEO who died this year, and the buyer is a trust organized by a local Dallas family, according to Perry.\nThe sale price equates to about $2,300 per square foot.\n4000 Euclid Avenue, Dallas | $25.5 million\nThe second-place sale\naccepted a far bigger discount. The 19,000-square-foot, six-bedroom, 10-bathroom mansion at 4000 Euclid Avenue, owned by manufacturing businessman Guinn Crousen,\nlisted for $33 million\n, but sold on Dec. 3 for $25.5 million, about $1,300 per square foot. The buyer is the Maui Kiki Trust, whose only public trustee is the buyer\u2019s agent, Compass Real Estate\u2019s Genna Skolnik.\n1 Dorset Place, Dallas\nA spec mansion asking $23 million\nwas the third most expensive home to sell in the Metroplex this year, squeaking in close behind the top two. Just two days after the late Pack\u2019s home sold in December, local entrepreneurs Sardar and Rida Sharif sold their 15,700-square-foot, six-bedroom, eight-bathroom mansion to Tu and Alex Dao, CEO and president of Plano-based Orthomed Anesthesia. Both sides purchased through trusts in their names. The final sale price is unavailable, but the listing price comes down to about $1,500 per square foot.\nJonathan Rosen with Compass Real Estate had the listing.\n4307 Armstrong Parkway, Highland Park\nUniversity of San Francisco trustee and Fisher Investments vice chairman, Jeff Silk, and his wife, Naomi Silk, bought the four-bedroom, six-bathroom home at 4307 Armstrong Parkway from James and Rosemary Strode when it was asking $20 million, about $1,900 per square foot. The property first listed in October 2024 and toggled on and off the market until the purchase in May. Compass agent Michelle Wood had the listing. The sale price was not disclosed.\n3917 Gillon Avenue, Highland Park\nCustom homebuilder Colby Craig sold this 10,000-square-foot spec mansion asking $16.5 million, or about $1,600 per square foot, in January to an LLC managed by Plano estates attorney Toby Eisenberg. Gina Lester with Briggs Freeman Sotheby\u2019s International represented the mystery buyer, and Ebby Halliday agent Danielle Brasher represented the seller. The sale price was not disclosed.\n5222 Park Lane, Dallas\nA trust managed by Melissa McMahan sold the 15,000-square-foot property on over an acre, asking $16 million, at 5222 Park Lane to Arizona investors Larry and Maria Smith in July. Eric Narosov of Allie Beth Allman and Associates had the listing. The sale price was not disclosed.\nThe seven-bedroom, 10-bathroom house is in prestigious Old Preston Hollow. Park Lane neighbors include the former homes of oil tycoon Cary Maguire, which briefly\nlisted for $28.5 million\nearlier this year, and entertainment agent to the stars Gary Osier, who recently\nsold his property\nafter listing it for $11.7 million.\n5805 Red Wolf Lane, Plano | $15.9M\nWith a sale price of $15.9 million\n, the outlier on this list reportedly set a record for Collin County residential deals. Matt Rutledge, founder of Woot.com, sold the property to BuzzBalls founder Merrilee Kick and her family.\nThe Kicks bought the 12,300-square-foot home for about $1,300 per square foot in May. The house is on a 6.75-acre lot, which includes a private lake, a lighted tennis court and a guest house.\nMarking another outlier on a list dominated by Allie Beth Allman and Compass, Keller Williams agent Kari Schuveiller represented the buyer. The Perry-Miller Streiff Group at Dave Perry-Miller Real Estate had the listing.\n10006 Hollow Way Road, Dallas\nThis home\n, asking $14.9 million, was one of several spec mansions developed by Crescent Estates founder Mehrdad Moayedi on land formerly belonging to the\nCrespi Estate\n, a manor at 5619 Walnut Hill Lane which remains the most expensive listing in Texas. Moayedi bought the Crespi Estate at auction for $36.2 million in 2017 and replatted some of the property\u2019s acreage for a luxury subdivision.\nAlmost 2 acres went to this 11,400-square foot, seven-bedroom, 10-bathroom mansion, which sold in September to Hector Martinez Martinez. Dave Perry-Miller agents represented both sides of the deal. The listing price comes down to $1,300 per square foot.\nFrom January to February, Moayedi had the home listed at $15.9 million. The sale price was not disclosed.\nToday, the original Crespi Estate is asking $64 million.\n3906 Shenandoah Street, Highland Park\nA trust in the name of Randall Kendrick, founder of\nXebec Realty Investments\n, bought the 9,100-square-foot home at 3906 Shenandoah Street from developer Hugh Uhalt in July when it was asking $14 million, or about $1,500 per square foot. Uhalt built the four-bedroom, five-bathroom home on 0.37 acres in 2021.\nThe sale price was not disclosed.\n10335 Lennox Lane, Dallas\nStanding out from the French traditionals that dominate the list, the\nsteel-and-stone contemporary at 10335 Lennox Lane\nwas built by Atrium Fine Homes this year. Rohan Thambrahalli and Melonie Carnegie, husband-and-wife founders of fintech app Growvana, purchased it in July when it was asking $12.3 million, or about $1,000 per square foot.\nIt was also the only home on this list to cut its asking price. The sellers, Dallas physicians Hooman and Tannaz Sedighi, had listed the property in February for $13.7 million.\nThe sale price was not disclosed.\n",

        "content": "An elite lakefront corridor north of Chicago had most of the top luxury residential sales in Chicagoland this year, with some\nNorth Shore homes\nreaching values never before seen in Illinois.\nSix of the seven most expensive single-family home sales this year took place on a three-mile stretch of Sheridan Road between Winnetka and Kenilworth. Two of those homes, both in Winnetka, sold for more than $30 million, marking the most expensive homes sold in Chicagoland history.\nAnd one agent, Jena Radnay of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate, was on one or both sides of all six of those North Shore deals. The preeminent dealmaker for the North Shore\u2019s coveted lakefront properties, Radnay was the sixth-highest selling agent in Cook County in\nThe Real Deal\u2019s 2025 rankings\n, with $213 million in sales across 41 transactions.\nThe concentration of top-tier sales in the North Shore is a change from\nrecent years\n, when neighborhoods like Lincoln Park, the Gold Coast and Streeterville dominated the list. The deals are also getting bigger. In 2024, three deals cleared $10 million, and in 2023 it was four. This year, the top six deals in Cook County all closed for more than $10 million.\nChicago\u2019s luxury market took off in 2025, as strong stock market returns drove wealthy buyers toward real estate, and scarce inventory sharpened competition for trophy properties. In Cook County, 105 sales were over $4 million between October 2024 and October 2025, according to research by\nThe Real Deal.\nThe run of luxury success is likely to continue into 2026. Billionaire Citadel founder Ken Griffin\u2019s last Chicago property \u2014 the top-floor penthouse at the Park Tower \u2014 is under contract with a\n$12.5 million list price\n. And a spec mansion on the lake in Kenilworth is looking to beat the record in that village,\nasking nearly $17 million\n.\nHere are the most expensive home sales in Cook County of 2025, based on\nTRD\u2019s\nresearch.\n609 Sheridan Road, Winnetka | $32.5 million\nJust months after a neighboring mansion set the all-time record for a Chicagoland home sale, this 16,000-square-foot mansion snatched the crown with a\n$32.5 million off-market deal\nin November. Jeff Quicksilver, a co-founder of Walton Street Capital, and his wife Ashley Quicksilver, who owns a local fashion boutique, sold the French provincial-inspired estate.\nThey built the home in 2017 after tearing down the previous home on the 1.6-acre site. The design was led by architecture firm Northworks, with interior design by Kara Mann. The Quicksilvers bought that previous home for $8 million in 2013.\nRadnay represented both the Quicksilvers and the buyer, who has not yet been identified. The deal also included about $2 million in personal property included in the house.\n419 Sheridan Road, Winnetka\n| $31.3 million\nThis 13,894-square-foot lakefront estate held the title of Chicago\u2019s priciest home resale for a few months, after selling for $31.3 million in August. Retired Goldman Sachs partner Muneer Satter and his wife, Kristen Hertel, sold the property. The estate features 223 feet of private beach, a boathouse and an infinity pool.\nThe\nseven-bedroom mansion\n, built in 1928 and designed by architect Ernset Mayo, underwent significant renovations under Satter and Hertel\u2019s ownership. The couple first purchased the property in 2002 and bought an adjacent parcel in 2013. They spent\ntens of millions on renovations\nand additions on the estate.\nRadnay represented both sides of the deal. The buyer was not identified in public records.\n219 Sheridan Road, Kenilworth | $14.5 million\nThis 1907 Colonial Revival mansion traded for\n$14.5 million in October\n, becoming the most expensive home ever sold in Kenilworth. Built by Paul Starrett \u2014 the man who designed the Empire State Building \u2014 the 8,280-square-foot home was sold by designer Yoanna Kulas.\nKulas, who bought the home built in 1906 in 2020 for $4.5 million, renovated and modernized the interior while preserving its historic features. The renovations were led by architect Michael Abraham and luxury designer Mick De Giulio.\nRadnay represented both Kulas and the unidentified buyers in the deal, which closed at nearly 97 percent of its asking price.\n973 Sheridan Road, Winnetka | $12 million\nThis seven-bedroom coastal-style mansion kicked off the summer\u2019s high-end frenzy when it sold for $12 million in June. The\n9,650-square-foot home\nis decked out with amenities including a basketball court and golf simulator. It sits on a bluff with 100 feet of private beach.\nThe sellers were a trust associated with Luke and Margaret Kelly. They built the home in 2020 on the 1.75-acre site that they purchased for $6.19 million in 2017. John Baylor and Cricket King of @properties represented the seller, while Radnay brought the buyer. The home was bought under a land trust that obscured the new owner\u2019s identity.\n765 Sheridan Rd, Winnetka | $11.4 million\nThis\n15,800-square-foot lakefront\nhome sold for $11.4 million in July. The seller, Morris Silverman, bought the land for nearly $6 million in 2003 and finished the massive home in 2005. Silverman initially asked $18 million for the home in 2024, but cut the asking price to just under $12 million in February.\nThe interiors feature heavy detailing, including a Chagall-inspired mosaic ceiling and beveled mahogany floors. Outside, the property has a pool, an outdoor kitchen and 100 feet of private beach.\nRadnay represented the seller, while Annie Flanagan of @properties represented the buyer, who isn\u2019t identified in public records.\n4 E Elm Street, PH23, Chicago | $10.1 million\nThe only Chicago property to sell for more than $10 million in 2025, this\nfull-floor penthouse in the Gold Coast\nsold for $10.1 million in March. Former Fortune Brands CEO Bruce Carbonari and his wife, Kate Carbonari, sold the 5,400-square-foot unit, which they bought as raw space in 2016.\nThe unit features panoramic views and a 12-foot-high glass wall that opens to a balcony. Sharon O\u2019Hara and Carrie McCormick of @properties represented the sellers, while @properties\u2019 Emily Sachs Wong represented the buyers.\nOther condos downtown have failed to crack $10 million this year, as the neighborhood has struggled to regain property values that dipped over the last few years. The closest was a penthouse at the St. Regis Chicago at 363 East Wacker Drive that sold for $9.25 million in October to Siri cofounder Dag Kittlaus.\n381 Sheridan Road, Winnetka | $9.6 million\nThree doors down from the second-priciest home of the year,\nthe mansion at 381 Sheridan Road\nbrought in $9.6 million when it sold in June. The home\u2019s seller was Tom Day, CEO of Reyes Beer Division, who bought it for $7 million in 2022 from Neil Fitzpatrick, co-founder of quantitative trading firm Headlands Technologies.\nThe 8,100-square-foot Neo-Georgian home includes a theater, gym and sports simulator. Radnay represented the sellers, while Grace Flatt of @properties represented the buyers, who are not identified in public records.\n",

        "content": "The billionaire sheen of\n220 Central Park South\nis getting scuffed by a decidedly unglamorous neighbor dispute this holiday season.\nGainsborough Studios, the landmarked 1908 co-op next door at 222 Central Park South, is suing Vornado Realty Trust over damage allegedly caused by years of heavy-duty construction at the ultra-luxury supertall, the New York Post\nreported\n. The co-op is seeking at least $3 million to cover repairs it claims Vornado agreed to pay for but refuses to reimburse.\nThe allegations paint a vivid picture of what happens when a 70-story tower rises beside a 16-story historic building.\nExcavation for 220 Central Park South began in 2014 with blasting through bedrock to create three underground levels about 50 feet below grade, according to the complaint filed in Manhattan Supreme Court. By the end of that year, Gainsborough\u2019s building had shifted downward and eastward, twisting nearly an inch at the top, per the complaint.\nThat movement, the suit claims, triggered a cascade of problems: cracked foundations, broken windows, chipped skylights, air conditioning issues and damage to the historic facade.\nWhile the repairs have since been completed, Gainsborough says it paid the costs itself despite agreements signed in 2008 and 2014 that required Vornado to cover construction-related damage.\nResidents and board members didn\u2019t mince words.\nOne longtime resident told the Post the building was \u201cbasically\u2026molested by the whole thing,\u201d while board president Tod Williams, whose architecture firm occupies the ground floor, said the blasting \u201cfelt like a seismic shift\u201d and forced workers to wear noise-canceling headphones for more than a year.\nVornado disputes responsibility. In court filings, its attorney said any damage was caused by \u201cintervening acts of third parties,\u201d not the developer\u2019s work. Vornado declined to comment to the publication.\nThe stakes are modest by Billionaires\u2019 Row standards. Gainsborough\u2019s $3 million claim is a rounding error compared to the roughly $3.5 billion in sales at 220 Central Park South, which cost about\n$1.5 billion to build\n. The tower is home to nine of the 20 most expensive residential sales in New York City history, including Ken Griffin\u2019s record-setting $238 million purchase and an\n$82.5 million deal this year\n.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The partners filed an application with Miami-Dade County\u2019s Shoreline Development Review Committee, the South Florida Business Journal\nreported\n.\nMiami Beach-based Prosper is led by Jay Roberts. Roberts and Torrealba tapped Revuelta Architecture International to design the tower.\nThe project is slated to have 3,300 square feet of restaurant space, 6,400 square feet of offices and\n12 guest rooms\nfor condo owners. Units will range from 1,000 to 2,700 square feet, spanning one-, two- and three-bedroom floorplans. Four four-bedroom penthouses will span between 2,500 and 3,800 square feet, each with private pools.\nThe tower will also have a pool and an amenity deck.\nNorth Bay Village\nemerged as a hotbed of condo development in recent years. Earlier this month, developer Vivian Dimond\nlanded $67 million in construction financing\nfor Tula Residences, a waterfront condo project that had previously stalled out under developer Pacific &amp; Orient Properties.\nAlso in North Bay Village, Related Group and Macklowe Properties are planning\na Ritz-Carlton-branded complex\nwith two 43-story buildings with 364 condos. And Mikael Hamaoui\u2019s Riviera Horizons is planning a 30-story, 70-unit\nPagani-branded condo tower\n.\nTorrealba, who started MG a decade ago, has a project pipeline of more than $500 million across South Florida. In July, he landed\n$39 million\nin construction financing for a 13-unit Coral Gables townhome development. In April, he\nscored a $105 million construction loan\nfor a planned 10-story, 347-unit apartment building in Hialeah.\nEarlier this year, Prosper\u2019s Roberts partnered with Versluys Group on\na planned $650 million luxury condo tower\nin Brickell. The 60-story, 158-unit project will have 300 feet of waterfront along the Miami River.\u2013\u2013\nKate Hinsche\n",

The year\u2019s priciest sale clocked in at\n$332.1 million\n.\nIn 2024, the\n10 biggest deals\nin the same nine months totaled $595 million. That year there was only one nine-figure deal, and at\n$103 million\n, it was 31 percent less than 2025\u2019s No. 1 deal.\nThis year\u2019s deals trounced 2024 in terms of square footage. In 2025, the top 10 deals came to 3.7 million square feet, of which 2.1 million square feet was in one project. The year prior, transactions tallied roughly 1 million square feet.\nOn a per-square-foot basis, 2024 fared better. The average price of the top 10 retail sales this year was $607, with only one deal over $1,000 per foot.

Lakewood Center | Pacific Retail Capital Partners, Lyon Living and Silverpeak | $332.1 million\nThe biggest retail deal of the year was Macerich\u2019s\n$332.1 million\nsale of Lakewood Center.

The two-story Petersen Building has two tenants, La La Land souvenirs and gifts on the bottom floor and Marshall\u2019s on the second floor, according to Aaron Bettencourt, managing director of transactions for Reza Investment Group, which represented the seller.\nThis is the second year in a row that the buyers and the seller made\nTRD\n\u2019s top retail sales list, though they were in unrelated deals in 2024.\n5.

        "content": "A\nBrentwood\nmansion billing itself as a private sanctuary on about an acre lot turned the heads of a prospective buyer to land the No. 1 spot among last week\u2019s signed contracts.\nThe 11,000-square-foot residence at 1504 North Kenter Avenue hopped into the top spot on the\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n, with a $25.9 million asking price that pencils out to $2,260 per square foot.\nThe weekly roundup, compiled by Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team, counts Los Angeles County homes in the Multiple Listing Service asking $4 million or more.\nAcross the county, 14 properties went into contract last week, adding up to $142.2 million in asking volume, according to the\nEklund Gomes report\n. Compared to the year-ago period, that\u2019s four fewer contracts. Still, the total asking volume last week was up over 20 percent from a year earlier.\nThe priciest deal featured a 2024 new build that was designed by architect Richard Landry\u2019s Los Angeles-based Landry Design Group.

        "content": "A veteran San Francisco developer wants to put new condo supply back on the table near Oracle Park after years of false starts downtown.\nDavid O\u2019Keeffe, working with San Francisco\u2013based Stanton Architecture, has floated plans for a 33-story condominium tower in South Beach, a block away from Oracle Park, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The proposal calls for 260 units at 329 Bryant Street, a half-acre site currently occupied by low-rise commercial buildings.\nPlans submitted to the city show a slender tower rising above two historic structures that would remain in place, alongside three levels of parking, said Stanton Architecture\u2019s Stephen Allen.\nO\u2019Keeffe, a longtime player in the neighborhood, picked up the four parcels that make up the site from Fortress Real Estate Advisors for $7.3 million in October 2024. His past projects nearby include the Hotel Via across from Oracle Park and a 44-unit condo building on King Street, both developed before the city\u2019s residential pipeline largely froze during the pandemic-era downturn.\nTo unlock extra height and density, the project would include 40 affordable units under California\u2019s density bonus law, a now-standard trade-off for developers trying to pencil new housing in San Francisco.\nStanton Architecture said the condos are aimed at the mid-to-upper market rather than the ultra-luxury tier that once dominated new towers near the waterfront. Unit sizes would range from sub-500-square-foot one-bedrooms to three-bedroom homes topping 1,100 square feet, offering a broader mix than many pre-pandemic condo projects.\nNew ground-up residential development in San Francisco has been scarce as developers grappled with falling rents, weak buyer demand and stubbornly high construction costs. In recent months, however, some architects and landowners have\nbegun dusting off plans\n, betting that improving market sentiment could support new starts. Still, more than 20,000 homes have been approved citywide but little has been built, with developers sidelined by high interest rates and construction costs as capital instead chases existing apartment deals, as\nThe Real Deal\nreported\nover the weekend.\nThat makes the timing\u00a0 fluid. A final application is expected next year, with the construction schedule hinging on city approvals and whether San Francisco\u2019s fragile residential recovery continues to firm up. For now, the proposal could stand as another signal that local developers are cautiously reentering the ring.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

BridgeCity Capital provided the financing for the 14-story development.\nThe financing comes at an 80 percent loan-to-cost ratio.

        "content": "Faced with fire damage, frozen permits and a City Hall she says can\u2019t scale, a Pacific Palisades developer has made a radical pitch a year after the destruction: break away from Los Angeles.\nSanta Monica-based developer and reality TV alum Elaine Culotti is pushing for the Pacific Palisades to secede from the City of Los Angeles after losing roughly 20 percent of her real estate portfolio in the January fire, the Santa Monica Daily Press\nreported\n. Culotti argues the city\u2019s disaster response exposed deeper structural failures that threaten property values, rebuilding timelines and insurability across fire-prone hillside neighborhoods.\nIn the days after the blaze, Culotti said state and local officials touted debris-clearing capacity that appeared robust until she realized the figures applied to all of California, not Los Angeles County or the Palisades specifically. As residents struggled through conflicting guidance and opaque timelines, Culotti said it became clear the city lacked the logistical capacity to handle a disaster of that scale.\nCulotti\u2019s, who starred on Discovery\u2019s \u201cUndercover Billionaire,\u201d makes the call after she devised an alternative debris-removal strategy dubbed \u201cDebris on Rail.\u201d It would have moved fire waste from the Palisades, Malibu and Altadena via rail lines to a processing facility in Puente Hills. The plan, she said, was vetted with FEMA, the governor\u2019s\u00a0 emergency services office and the Army Corps of Engineers and even pitched to federal appropriations staff in Washington. California ultimately declined to adopt it.\nCulotti took the rejection as an indicator that the size of Los Angeles\u2019 government has made it unwieldy to respond effectively to crises. She says the breakdown has direct consequences for real estate, from stalled permits and frozen valuations to mounting carrying costs for owners unable to rebuild, rent or sell damaged properties.\n\u201cHow do you value real estate if you can\u2019t sell it, rent it, repair it, or build on it? How do you keep paying mortgages, security, maintenance, brush clearing, insurance with no path forward?\u201d she told the Daily Press. \u201cNo industry can survive like that. And no homeowner should be asked to.\u201d\nHer answer is municipal divorce. Culotti is advocating for the Palisades to become its own city, with local control over infrastructure, emergency response and rebuilding. She is also working to establish a community center to serve as a civic hub, though she claims even that effort has run into resistance from city agencies.\nNo major neighborhood has successfully seceded from an existing large city like Los Angeles in modern times. But nearby examples like West Hollywood, which\nincorporated\nin 1984, and Malibu, which\nfollowed\nin 1991, show how affluent, civically engaged communities have used cityhood to seize control of zoning, development and environmental rules. Those took years to organize, but ultimately reshaped local real estate outcomes for decades.\nThe secession push comes as wildfire risk, insurance pullbacks and rebuilding delays increasingly shape land values across Los Angeles\u2019 hillside markets. That pressure has only intensified as the Los Angeles City Council has moved to\nforcibly clear the last uncleared Palisades fire lots\nnearly a year after the blaze as prolonged cleanup timelines stall rebuilding and prolong uncertainty for owners and lenders alike.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "Trader Joe\u2019s just made a pricey Santa Monica land play, snapping up a former Rite Aid along Wilshire Boulevard as it continues to expand in Southern California and scoop up drugstore boxes left behind by bankrupt chains.\nThe Monrovia, California\u2013based grocer paid $22 million for the 17,800-square-foot property at 1331 Wilshire Boulevard, or about $1,236 per square foot, according to public records cited by the\nLos Angeles Times\n. The site, which sits on roughly 1.4 acres with about 125 surface parking spaces, was sold by a private owner.\nThe deal is another example of the growing reuse of Rite Aid locations, which began to flood the Southern California market after the pharmacy chain filed for its second Chapter 11 bankruptcy in two years in May.\nThat month, Rite Aid put more than 1,200 owned and leased stores\nup for sale nationwide\n, including 59 in Los Angeles County alone, with A&amp;G Real Estate Partners marketing the portfolio. At the time, brokers described the sales process as fast-moving, with grocers and value retailers among the most aggressive bidders.\nTrader Joe\u2019s has been one of the few brick-and-mortar retailers leaning into that churn. The company recently surpassed 600 stores nationwide and has steadily added locations in California, where competition for well-located grocery sites remains fierce despite broader retail softness. In December, Trader Joe\u2019s opened a new store in the Orange County municipality of Costa Mesa, and earlier this year it disclosed plans to\nopen nine additional locations\nacross SoCal, from the San Fernando Valley to San Diego County.\nRecent market trends explain the disconnect.\nSanta Monica retail rents have eased but remain high in prime corridors, with average asking rents slipping from about $5.50 to $4.47 per square foot per month while deals on Montana Avenue, Main Street and Wilshire Boulevard continue to close north of $5 and as high as nearly $10 per foot, according to a CoStar-sourced\nreport\nfrom Illi CRE. At the same time, vacant available retail space has more than doubled to roughly 635,000 square feet since it began rising in mid-2023, punctuating softer overall fundamentals while reinforcing that well-located, grocery-anchored sites still draw aggressive pricing.\nSecond-generation drugstores with parking, visibility and neighborhood-serving zoning that can be quickly converted into smaller-format grocery stores have fit that pattern. Those boxes have become especially valuable as ground-up retail development\nremains constrained\nby high construction costs and entitlement hurdles.\nFor landlords and lenders sitting on empty or soon-to-be-vacant Rite Aid sites, Trader Joe\u2019s move is another sign that the best-located assets will clear, even at premium pricing. For everyone else, the scramble to backfill thousands of former pharmacies is still just getting started.\n\u2014\nJudah Duke\n",

His wife, Ashley Quicksilver, owns Athene, a high-end women\u2019s boutique in\nWinnetka\n. Together, they used a land trust to purchase the Kenilworth property at\n219 Sheridan Road\n, masking their identities until now \u2014 a tactic also employed by the still unknown buyers of their record-setting Winnetka estate.\nThe Kenilworth home sits on roughly a half-acre with 115 feet of Lake Michigan frontage and comes with a lineup of outdoor amenities, including a boathouse, fire pit area, glass-enclosed patio and multiple terraces. Records show the Quicksilvers have already explored zoning relief to add a swimming pool on the bluff\u2019s land and have expressed interest in adding a bathroom to the existing boathouse.\nBuilt in 1914, the three-story mansion was developed by\nPaul Starrett\n, the legendary builder behind the Empire State Building and the Lincoln Memorial. The six-bedroom home has been fully restored, blending preserved architectural details \u2014 original moldings, oak floors and custom wrought-iron railings \u2014 with modern upgrades, including new mechanical systems, windows, a smart home platform and zoned climate control.\nHighlights of the interior work include a primary suite with a custom wardrobe room featuring leather accents, along with a lower level outfitted with a wine cellar, theater, catering kitchen and wellness center complete with sauna, steam room and massage space. The $14.5 million price tag also included roughly $500,000 worth of furniture and personal property, according to records.\nJena Radnay of @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate represented the Quicksilvers in both deals and confirmed to Elite Street their role as the Kenilworth buyers.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about a down-trade,\u201d Radnay told the outlet. \u201cIt was an up-trade.

Critics argue the tower far exceeds local zoning and clashes with the mayor\u2019s newly adopted \u201cFamily Zoning\u201d plan, which seeks to guide growth in historically low-density neighborhoods like the Marina.\nAlign counters that state housing laws trump local rules. By locking in union backing from the San Francisco Building and Construction Trades Council and the NorCal Carpenters Union, the developer can invoke AB 2011\u2019s accelerated approval timeline, potentially forcing the city to sign off within months rather than years. The law was written explicitly to sidestep protracted local fights that have stalled housing production across San Francisco.\nThe Marina proposal is just one pilot piece of a broader bet.\nAlign and Safeway have floated\nsimilar mixed-use redevelopments\nat four major grocery sites citywide, totaling roughly 3,500 apartments, with additional locations under consideration. The push has made Safeway-owned land a new front line in San Francisco\u2019s housing wars.\nStill, uncertainty looms. Align has not disclosed financing details or a construction timeline, and city officials have signaled they plan to scrutinize the project closely, despite the state law\u2019s limits on local discretion.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "One of the Austin area\u2019s\nfastest-growing suburbs\nis trying a lighter touch approach to economic development: speed.\nThe Hutto City Council voted Dec. 18 to fast-track what it calls \u201ceconomically impactful development,\u201d adopting a policy that promises a 10-business-day review period for permits tied to industrial and commercial projects. The resolution takes effect Jan. 1 and applies across all permit types tied to those projects, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nResidential developers won\u2019t see a change. Single-family and multifamily projects will continue to follow Texas\u2019 standard 30-business-day review timeline. Instead the city\u2019s focus will remain on job creation and commercial tax base growth rather than more rooftops.\nThe move arose from a November meeting of the\nHutto Economic Development Corporation\n, whose board unanimously approved a letter urging the City Council to adopt the policy. In that letter, the EDC argued that shaving weeks off permitting timelines would make Hutto more competitive in attracting employers and private capital, accelerate the delivery of job-producing projects and signal a more responsive posture to developers and business operators.\nThe city appears to be positioning speed as a substitute for subsidies. Unlike many of its peers in the Austin metro, Hutto has generally avoided large incentive packages and tax abatements, opting instead for smaller, targeted efforts \u2014 such as backing a local bookstore and coffee shop with a $32,000 sales tax abatement to help with retrofitting a historic home for the enterprise \u2014 and process-driven enticements, according to the publication. Faster permits come with a price tag of zero.\nThat restraint is partly strategic. Hutto, about 30 miles northeast of downtown Austin with a population of roughly 43,000, has been grappling with infrastructure constraints, including water capacity, after years of rapid residential growth. Prioritizing industrial and\ncommercial projects\nallows the city to balance its growth mix without opening the incentive spigot.\nThe policy also arrives as the city looks to reset after a pair of high-profile development setbacks. Houston-based Midway Companies\u2019 contract to redevelop the 250-acre\nCottonwood Tract\ninto a mixed-use destination was terminated earlier this year. Separately, Georgetown-based Headwater Commercial Realty scrapped plans for a 242,000-square-foot industrial project on EDC-owned land.\nCity officials have said interest in replacing both projects remains strong, and the new permitting policy reads like a signal to would-be suitors that Hutto is serious about cutting friction.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Mars is gearing up for a major office expansion in Chicago\u2019s Fulton Market, teeing up what could be one of the neighborhood\u2019s larger recent leases as it absorbs snack giant Kellanova.\nThe McLean, Virginia-based company has tentatively reached an agreement to lease a large block of space at the building at\n400 North Aberdeen Street\n, according to people familiar with the deal. If finalized as expected, the lease would likely exceed 100,000 square feet and further cement Mars\u2019 presence in Chicago following its $36 billion acquisition of Kellanova, CoStar\nreported\n.\nThe 16-story building\u2019s biggest contiguous space availability is roughly 170,000 square feet, according to CoStar data, putting Mars in position to anchor a sizable portion of the building.\nMars recently completed its acquisition of Kellanova, the Chicago-based spinoff from Kellogg that houses brands including Cheez-It, Pringles, Pop-Tarts, Rice Krispies Treats and RxBar. Kellanova had been headquartered in a boutique office building at 412 North Wells Street in River North, while Mars already operates a significantly expanded office and research campus on Goose Island.\nIt\u2019s not yet clear whether the\nFulton Market\nspace would consolidate employees from those locations or serve as an additional hub. Mars has been touring large blocks of downtown Chicago office space, according to people familiar with the search, suggesting a broader rethinking of its post-acquisition space.\nIn a statement to the outlet, a Mars spokesperson declined to confirm the deal, saying the company does not comment on speculation about real estate transactions and is \u201calways evaluating investments and optimizing office space\u201d across its U.S. portfolio. Trammell Crow, the Dallas-based landlord of the building, also declined to comment.\nMars has also eyed space under construction by competing developer Fulton Street Companies at\n919 West Fulton Street\n, which could still be in the running should the Aberdeen Street tower deal fall through.\nThe Aberdeen Street building is one of two\nFulton Market\nproperties branded as Fulton Labs by Trammell Crow, a concept pitched to tenants spanning traditional office, life sciences and research-and-development uses. Tenants already in the building include a research hub backed by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan, Illinois Institute of Technology and chemical products firm Mattiq. Battery startup Pure Lithium recently moved its headquarters there from the Boston area.\nCompleted in 2022, the building was about 51 percent leased before accounting for the Mars deal, according to CoStar.\nThe potential lease would mark a second major Chicago investment by Mars in just a few years. In 2022, the company announced a roughly $40 million expansion of its Goose Island office and research campus, billed as its largest innovation hub globally. That project opened in early 2024.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

That would smash the local record, a nearly $13 million sale on the waterfront two years ago.\nThe modernist home was designed more than a half-century ago by famed architect Norman Jaffe. The 5,100-square-foot, six-bedroom home is on a nearly two-acre property off of Gardiner\u2019s Bay.\nBroughman and his then-partner, British media entrepreneur Waheed Alli, purchased the property from the Osofsky family in 2020 for more than $7.1 million. They renovated the home, built specifically for the Osofskys, for two years after its acquisition, preserving much of the architecture.\nIt\u2019s unclear how much money was spent on renovations, which included relocating the kitchen and installing a bar at the former kitchen location. Broughman primarily used the property for weekends and summers.\nAmenities include a chef\u2019s kitchen, a private gym, a movie theater, a tennis court with pickleball lines and a detached two-car garage. There\u2019s also a heated gunite pool, an outdoor pergola with a kitchen and fireplace and a separate guest wing.\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Nick Brown and Lidia Murphy have the\nlisting\n, which breaks down to $3,529 per square foot.\nThe Shelter Island sale record was nearly broken earlier this year when a deal for the newly built One Pandion Road went into contract with\na $15 million ask\n. The purchase ultimately closed at $12.85 million, however, according to\nBehind the Hedges\n.\nOne Pandion was developed by High Line Properties\u2019 Joshua Greenwald, who bought the land for $3.25 million in 2021. Greenwald completed construction last October and rented the home for $475,000 from Memorial Day through Labor Day.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Bidding opened earlier this month with a $72 million bid. The reserve bid was $70 million, a spokesperson for the real estate auction house said.\nA Miami federal bankruptcy court hearing to finalize the sale is set for Jan. 9.\nThe site at\n340 Biscayne Boulevard\n, home to the 200-key Holiday Inn Port of Miami-Downtown, is owned by two entities managed by Brazilian developer Gilberto Bomeny. His entities paid $65 million for the property in 2015. The 10-story hotel dates to 1950, records show.\nThe owner before Bomeny secured city approvals for a project dubbed\nRegalia on the Bay\n. Designed by Arquitectonica, the 82-story, 950,000-square-foot tower was planned to include 374 condos, 120 hotel rooms, offices and retail, along with 500 parking spaces.\nThe Bomeny entities filed for Chapter 11 protection earlier this year to stave off a\nUCC foreclosure\nby the Cirrus affiliate that alleges the site\u2019s owners defaulted on a $70 million loan. When U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Laurel Isicoff authorized the auction last month, she also approved a $101.5 million credit bid by the Cirrus affiliate, which is the largest creditor.\nJudge Isicoff also authorized closing the Holiday Inn upon execution of a purchase agreement, with the hotel\u2019s franchise license set to end on Jan. 5. Sotheby\u2019s Concierge Auctions will receive a $750,000 fee.\nCirrus appears anxious to close the deal, according to a motion filed this week by the firm\u2019s attorneys. Five days after the auction ended, Bomeny\u2019s entities had not finalized the purchase and sale agreement, the motion states.\n\u201cThe delay disrupts the entire sale process to Cirrus\u2019 detriment,\u201d the motion states. \u201cThe debtors have four business days after the PSA is fully executed to file a motion seeking approval of the sale. Given the intervening holidays, absent immediate execution of the PSA, the motion will not be filed in time to provide Cirrus the court-mandated notice and time to respond.\u201d\nHowever, emails attached to the motion show that the real estate attorney for the Bomeny entities asked for more time due to the death of a close friend whose funeral service was on Monday.\nBomeny was a development partner in the Zaha Hadid\u2013designed\nOne Thousand Museum\ncondo tower in downtown Miami, and\nRegalia Residences\nin Sunny Isles Beach.",

The proposal would generate an estimated $43 million a year for marketing campaigns and financial incentives aimed squarely at landing large conventions and trade shows that fill hotel rooms.\nThe push is being led by\nChoose Chicago\n, which has quietly spent more than a year lining up support from hotel owners. Backers say they\u2019ve secured sign-off from at least 60 percent of affected properties, comfortably clearing the state-required threshold to move forward.\nThe surcharge would apply to hotels with at least 100 rooms within a defined district that includes the central business district, South Loop, McCormick Place and the\nIllinois Medical District\n. Unlike traditional hotel taxes, the money would not flow into the city\u2019s general coffers. Instead, it would be controlled by a new board representing hotel owners, with Choose Chicago administering the program.\nKristen Reynolds, who took over as CEO of Choose Chicago in April, told the outlet that the additional funding is critical if the city wants to compete with peers that routinely offer subsidies to lure major events. Choose Chicago\u2019s current $33 million budget trails rivals by a wide margin. Orlando tops $100 million annually, while Las Vegas approaches $500 million.\nThe plan has the backing of Mayor Brandon Johnson, and supporters hope to clear legislative hurdles by March. Alderman Jason Ervin, who introduced the resolution at the tail end of the council meeting, could tee up a vote as early as January. If approved, a public hearing would follow before a separate ordinance codifies the surcharge.\nThe proposal isn\u2019t without risk. Adding the 1.5 percent assessment would push Chicago\u2019s combined hotel tax rate to about 19 percent, the highest in the country. Proponents argue the added cost will be offset by\nstronger demand\ndriven by better marketing and incentives. Michael Jacobson, president of the Illinois Hotel &amp; Lodging Association, told the publication that more than 200 U.S. markets already use similar districts.\nThere\u2019s also a political angle. By letting the industry self-assess, the plan could make it harder for future administrations to justify raising the city\u2019s own hotel tax. Jacobson framed it as a win for alders citywide, noting hospitality workers from every ward depend on\ndowntown\ntourism.\nEven if approved early next year, the impact won\u2019t be immediate. Revenue collection and distribution lags mean the spending boost could take at least a year to materialize. Still, with Chicago logging more than 55 million visitors last year, boosters say standing still isn\u2019t an option in an increasingly competitive convention landscape.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Bay Area leaders may be cutting red tape, but new jobs data shows the cranes still aren\u2019t coming back.\nConstruction hiring across the Bay Area stayed sluggish over the past year, belying local officials\u2019 pushing for zoning, permitting and environmental reforms to jump-start development, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n, citing an analysis of federal labor data by the Associated General Contractors of America. It\u2019s a clearer signal of how far the region still sits from a full construction rebound despite the mounting political momentum to build.\nFrom September 2024 to September 2025, the San Francisco\u2013San Mateo\u2013Redwood City metro added roughly 1,200 construction jobs, a gain of about 3 percent. That increase lagged many large US metros, while other parts of the Bay Area fared worse. Construction employment barely budged in San Jose and declined outright in Oakland, Fremont and Berkeley.\nNationally, construction employment\ngrew\n, up roughly 33,000 jobs year over year, marking the first year-over-year gain below 100,000 in four years. The national gains were largely concentrated in infrastructure, manufacturing and data-center hubs rather than in coastal housing markets.\nRoughly half of US metro areas added construction jobs over the same period, led by markets like Washington, DC, Charlotte and Boise, where those kinds of projects are driving steady work. The Bay Area\u2019s development slowdown, meanwhile, continues to weigh on employment amid acute demand for housing and commercial space.\nSome of the reforms Bay Area leaders and Sacramento pushed during that period were\nsignificant on paper\n, including strengthened\nBuilder\u2019s Remedy\nenforcement,\nexpanded permitting\nunder SB 35 and other laws aimed at speeding approval for housing when cities fail to meet state mandates.\nBut developers and builders say those changes have yet to translate into enough shovel-ready work to buoy hiring numbers. Contractors, according to the Business Times, say the job numbers mirror reality on the ground.\nHospital projects and public-sector work have provided some stability, including a recently completed $176 million health campus in San Mateo County. But private commercial and market-rate multifamily construction has been scarce. Builders expect San Francisco to lead any rebound, with modest workforce growth potentially picking up in 2026, followed later by Silicon Valley as more projects come off the sidelines.\nThe timing matters. Construction employment is often a lagging indicator, but it\u2019s also one of the sharpest signals that projects have cleared financing hurdles and regulatory reviews. Still, the numbers won\u2019t show the impacts of Los Angeles\u2019 historic Family Zoning Plan passed\nthree weeks ago\n, for example, for some time.\nLabor market experts, including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, however, have flagged that the federal government may be overstating job gains further still \u2014 by\nas much as 60,000 a month\n\u2014 after the October government shutdown paused the reports for months. Fed officials have cut rates this year precisely because labor data suggest hiring has slowed and downside employment\nrisks have risen\n, a dynamic that could temper any construction rebound in 2026.The data suggests that while Bay Area policymakers have made it easier to say yes to development, it may still take years (and lower costs, or better capital markets) before those approvals translate into sustained building and jobs.\n\u2014 Judah Duke\n",

        "content": "A path to disbanding homeowners associations for residents unhappy with their HOAs is part of a proposal ahead of next year\u2019s session of the Florida Legislature.\nRep. Juan Carlos Porras filed House Bill 657, another legislative attempt to address HOA problems and help residents clashing with their leadership. But experts on association law say the proposal would cause more problems than it solves.\nThe proposal also calls for creating a Community Association Court Program to focus solely on disputes arising at condo associations and HOAs, a way for these cases to work their way through the courts faster and alleviate the backlog of such litigation.\nAcross the state, homeowners living in communities governed by associations for years have raised complaints of\nwrongdoing\nagainst board members, and in some cases also against the\nattorneys and management firms working for HOAs\n.\nAllegations have varied, with homeowners often claiming HOAs are withholding records and provide little transparency for assessment increases, as well as problems such as election interference, misappropriation of funds, and bullying and retaliation against those who speak out.\nThe most extreme case unraveled at the\nHammocks HOA\nin West Kendall, where police arrested four former board members and a fifth person on charges they siphoned close to $4 million from association coffers, according to criminal and civil court filings. The Hammocks, which consists of condos, single-family homes, townhomes and apartments on 3,800 acres and is home to about 18,000 residents, is South Florida\u2019s biggest HOA and second-largest in the state after\nThe Villages\n.\nProsecutors in the Hammocks HOA case claimed ex-board members hired contractors that did little to no work at the Hammocks and then diverted the payments to themselves. Two former board members pleaded guilty and are cooperating with investigators, and the rest of those charged have pleaded not guilty and are awaiting trial.\nUnder Porras\u2019 proposed legislation, a resident seeking to dismantle an HOA would start by filing a petition signed by 20 percent of homeowners. The board must then schedule a meeting within 60 days and set the rules for a vote on the termination, which would require approval by two-thirds of homeowners.\nThe HOA would be required to submit its plan of termination to the court and, if approved, to select a termination trustee, either the board or an appointed trustee, to wind down the association\u2019s affairs, including any pending litigation and debts, and sell off or dispose of the HOA\u2019s assets.\nPorras, the majority of whose district consists of the Hammocks, didn\u2019t return a request for comment.\nIn a statement to\nWJXT\nin Jacksonville, he said it\u2019s time for \u201cthe conversation if homeowner associations are really needed.\u201d\n\u201cIn my opinion, they act more as a failed experiment. They\u2019re a quasi-elected pseudo-government that have more power and are entitled to more rights than I think most cities and counties do,\u201d he told the news station.\nBut attorneys who specialize in HOAs said disbanding them won\u2019t be easy, and likely won\u2019t work at all. HOAs own common areas, including pools, tennis courts, lakes, playgrounds and clubhouses, but more important, the roads, gates, landscaping, lighting, sewage and flood control infrastructure such as retention ponds.\nAlthough some assets, such as landscape trucks, could be sold as part of the dissolution plan, infrastructure would be harder to dispose of.\n\u201cThe association has \u2026 obligations to the common areas,\u201d said attorney Carolina Sznajderman Sheir. \u201cYou may be dissolving the actual corporation, but how are you going to split up the assets? Who is going to take responsibility for maintaining the roadways [and other infrastructure]? Who is going to be responsible for operating, maintaining and insuring this?\u201d\nAttorney William Sklar said the bill\u2019s termination clause \u201cwouldn\u2019t work.\u201d\nMost Florida counties and municipalities have laws on their books that require for multi-home developments to include HOAs that will own, maintain and insure the infrastructure, said Sklar, of Carlton Fields. HB 657 essentially would go against these existing laws, which would necessitate a massive overhaul of regulations.\nLocal governments\u2019 mandate for the creation of HOAs for multi-home developments makes sense, he added. Because many of these communities are gated, the roads, stormwater and sewer systems are only used by the residents in an HOA.\n\u201cIf I am Miami-Dade County and you want to create 100 lots with 100 homes, I don\u2019t want everyone in Miami-Dade County to pay for that internal road,\u201d said Sklar. \u201cIt has nothing to do with the rest of [the county], so why should the citizens of Miami-Dade pay for every little community\u2019s roads or access?\u201d\nComplicating matters is that some HOAs consist of townhomes that share roofs. Disbanding an HOA may mean homeowners would have to agree on how to divide the maintenance bill.\n\u201cHow are they going to dissolve and maintain the roof?\u201d said Sheir, of Eisinger Law. \u201cHow do you informally split up the tab?\u201d\nUnder state law, HOAs already have a dissolution process. Every 30 years they have to vote on whether they want the association form of government to continue, said Travis Moore, a lobbyist with the Community Association Institute, a trade organization for managers, attorneys, contractors and other service providers to associations.\nPorras\u2019 \u201cinitial thought was to dissolve all HOAs and make them CDDs [\nCommunity Development Districts\n] or other kinds of quasi-governments,\u201d Moore said. But that \u201cis weird because then the developers get to be a local government except they aren\u2019t elected.\u201d\nSheir took issue with another clause in the bill: Starting July 1, each newly formed HOA has to include a statement in its governing documents that it\u2019s governed by the Florida Condominium Act. It would require existing HOAs to hold a meeting to decide whether to also include this statement in their declarations.\n\u201cHe is basically turning every HOA into a condo, which makes no sense,\u201d she said.\nCondo associations and HOAs are fundamentally different, attorneys said. For one, in a condo association, each unit owner has a percentage ownership share in common areas, and in an HOA, the association owns the common areas.\nAttorneys hailed the bill\u2019s call for a Community Association Court, however.\n\u201cI have personally heard from chief judges of several circuits \u2026 say to me, \u2018We don\u2019t need these covenant cases, mailbox color cases. We need to take them out of the circuit courts.\u2019\u201d Sklar said. \u201cSo this is a good alternative.\u201d\nFor both condo associations and HOAs, the bill removes the requirement for presuit mediation, allowing residents to directly file claims with the Community Association Court. Residents at condo associations still also have the option to file for arbitration through the state administrative process.\nHB 657 isn\u2019t the only upcoming bill aiming to reform associations. SB 906, sponsored by Sen. Ileana Garcia, calls for the creation of a state ombudsman for HOAs, after a similar proposal at this year\u2019s legislative session\nfizzled out\n.\nFlorida\u2019s legislative session starts Jan. 13.\n",

        "content": "A lender is placing a bet on suburban retail, as rooftops keep piling up west of Houston.\nDelray Beach, Florida-based\nForman Capital\nclosed a $37.1 million construction loan for The Oaks of District West, an open-air retail, restaurant and entertainment project planned in Richmond, about 30 miles southwest of downtown Houston. The loan, which closed last week, backs a development led by\nFerguson Family Partners\n, led by Bobby and Corey Ferguson, according to a press release from Forman.\nThe project will be built on roughly 10 acres at 21711 FM 1093, fronting the Westpark Tollway in a fast-growing residential corridor. Construction is slated to start in the first quarter of 2026, with completion expected in the third quarter of 2027, the release shows.\nThe Oaks of District West is designed as a walkable, suburban town center rather than a strip center. Plans call for about 87,244 square feet of rentable space spread across 10 buildings, anchored by a central green that\u2019s meant to function as a community gathering spot. More than 15 tenant spaces are planned.\nThe center is already about 70 percent pre-leased, according to the release, a level of early traction that lenders have increasingly demanded for speculative retail deals. Houston-based\nWhite House Global Properties\nis marketing the property according to the project\u2019s website.\nAccording to Forman, the tenant mix skews experiential and food-and-beverage heavy, with signed leases including from Grazia Italian Kitchen, Luckie\u2019s Burger, Pacific Coast Tacos, a virtual golf bar, Pecan Jack\u2019s Ice Cream and\nPicklr\n, which is an indoor pickleball concept.\nForman Capital\u2019s Scott Mehlman, the firm\u2019s chief investment officer and a partner, said in a statement that the deal hinges on a simple supply and demand imbalance. Richmond and the surrounding Fort Bend County submarkets have posted years of steady homebuilding, but new retail has lagged behind, particularly projects offering newer design and higher-end dining options.\nThe loan was originated by Mehlman, alongside Brett Forman and Ben Jacobson. Bobby Ferguson said both sides worked through multiple issues to close the deal, citing Forman Capital\u2019s flexibility.\nThe development will be part of Parkway Lakes \u2014 a 1,300-acre master-planned community south of Houston\u2019s Cinco Ranch area in Richmond. The Oaks will be adjacent to a Kelsey-Seybold Clinic, Whiskey River country dance hall and a theater opened by Star Cinema Grill.\n",

        "content": "Retail investment in Dallas-Fort Worth is closing the year on a strong note, with an East Texas buyer snapping up one of Plano\u2019s better-known mixed-use centers.\nCTO Realty Growth\nsaid that it sold the Shops at Legacy North for $78 million, or roughly $321 per square foot. The buyer wasn\u2019t named in the release, but Collin County land records show the property was acquired by ACH Legacy North Texas, an entity affiliated with Beaumont-based commercial real estate firm Albanese Cormier Holdings, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The deal closed on Friday.\nThe 243,000-square-foot property at 7300 Dallas Parkway was completed in 2007 as part of the broader Legacy Town Center area. It\u2019s about 85 percent leased and home to 31 tenants, according to the center\u2019s website. Tenants include Capital Grille, Benihana, Mexican Sugar and Mic Drop Comedy. The mix skews heavily toward dining and entertainment.\nShops at Legacy North traces its roots to the original Shops at Legacy, master-developed by The Karahan Companies under\nFehmi Karahan\n. That project became an early model for building an urban-style, walkable district within an office park setting, helping Plano transform the Legacy corridor into one of North Texas\u2019 most durable mixed-use nodes, according to the outlet.\nFor CTO, the timing of the sale was no accident. The Winter Park, Florida-based real estate investment trust bought the property in 2021 and has spent the past two years backfilling space left behind by\nWeWork\n. At the end of the third quarter, the company signed a 30,000-square-foot lease with a co-working operator slated to open by the end of 2026. That followed a 20,000-square-foot deal last year for a members-only social club, according to comments by CEO John Albright on a recent earnings call, according to the outlet.\nThose leases helped stabilize the center and set it up for disposition. CTO said proceeds from the Plano sale will be redeployed into other investments, including its Dec. 15 acquisition of Pompano Citi Centre, a 571,000-square-foot retail property in Florida.\nAfter unloading Shops at Legacy North, CTO\u2019s only remaining Dallas-Fort Worth holding is the\nPlaza at Rockwall\n, which it bought in 2023. Including the Plano deal, the company has sold $85.1 million in real estate this year at a weighted average exit cash cap rate in the mid-5 percent range, the outlet reported.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "pub_date_dt": "2025-12-25T14:00:00",
        "content": "In 2017, Leon Goldenberg filed an eviction case against a tenant who had stopped paying rent.\nI can\u2019t tell you how the case turned out. More than eight years later, it\u2019s still going.\nThe increasing difficulty of collecting rent is one of the things Goldenberg wishes he had foreseen a decade ago. As the owner and manager of more than 2,500 units, many of them rent-stabilized, he would have gotten out before things got this bad.\nGoldenberg has been\nbuying multifamily\nbuildings in New York City since 1983. He jokes that he now\nowns properties\nin every borough, plus Staten Island.\nA sense of humor helps Goldenberg keep his sanity in a city where everything has gone against rent-stabilized landlords for the past seven years.\nBut there\u2019s nothing funny about the plunge in rent collection that began with the pandemic. Even affordable housing nonprofits have seen collections rates drop by\n5 crucial percentage points\n.\n\u201cThat\u2019s because there\u2019s no reason to pay in New York,\u201d Goldenberg said at a recent\npanel discussion\nin Brooklyn. \u201cAnybody who is a tenant and pays in New York should have his head examined.\u201d\nHousing court is so\nslow\nand frequently unjust that the LeFrak Organization, the city\u2019s largest landlord,\nsued\nto get the courts to meet its statutory deadlines. But the lawsuit went nowhere, proving that those deadlines are not real.\n\u201cYou go to court and the judge says, \u2018Seven months out is your next hearing,\u2019\u201d Goldenberg said.\nThe rough stretch for owners of rent-stabilized buildings began with the\nradical rent law\nof 2019. Then came the pandemic, \u201ccancel rent,\u201d eviction moratoriums, inflation, soaring mortgage rates and insurance premiums,\nderegulation rollbacks\nand, last week, the\nCommunity Opportunity to Purchase Act\n.\nZohran Mamdani, other progressives and even President Donald Trump keep talking about affordability, but the apartment that Goldenberg has been trying to take back from a tenant since 2017 is hardly unaffordable. \u201cOn a $1,000 rent, he still owes me $65,000,\u201d the landlord said.\nAdvocates talk about the need for a strong safety net, but the safety net worked for that tenant: When the pandemic hit, the state\u2019s Emergency Rental Assistance Program paid thousands of dollars of his arrears.\nHowever, as with some\nother rent-aid programs\n, tenants could only get free money from ERAP if they stopped paying rent. It was a perverse incentive, fueled by socialists\u2019 \u201c\ncancel rent\n\u201d movement. ERAP ended, but the notion that rent is optional didn\u2019t.\nUnderlying Goldenberg\u2019s comment that tenants would be foolish to pay rent is a simple fact: People have all kinds of ways to\nlive rent-free\nfor years. One is to repeatedly damage your apartment, then tell housing court you\u2019re withholding rent because the unit needs repairs. Yes, this happens.\nYou can also buy time by calling Adult Protective Services and asking for help. The housing court judge will keep adjourning your eviction case until APS decides what to do. This can buy you a few months.\nDidn\u2019t get free legal counsel from the city? Got a cognitive issue that might justify a guardian ad litem to represent you? Need to care for a sick relative? Tell the court! Judges hand out adjournments like Halloween candy, and city officials will help, because the last thing they want is for tenants to end up in a homeless shelter.\nPerhaps tenants\u2019 most common tactic is to apply for a\none-shot deal\nfrom the Human Resources Administration. The judge won\u2019t kick you out if there\u2019s a chance HRA will come up with money to pay your arrears. If it does, the eviction case will be dismissed.\nThen, after a month or two, you can stop paying rent again and apply anew. Rinse and repeat!\nSome tenants get a one-shot every year. It\u2019s become an annual ritual \u2014 like Christmas, except the gifts come from taxpayers.\nIn theory, you have to pay back your one-shot. Reality check: Tenants living paycheck to paycheck often can\u2019t save thousands of dollars for arrears while also paying rent.\nGoldenberg had 36 good years in the landlord business before the tide turned against him in 2019, so he\u2019s hardly headed for the poor house. But he says 14 percent of all rent-stabilized buildings are in pre-foreclosure or foreclosure, and he expects that to double.\nHis average rent is $1,386 per month. After property tax, water and sewer, heat, mortgage and insurance payments, little or nothing is left. Sometimes less than nothing.\nThe Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, he said, \u201chas totally destroyed multifamily, rent-stabilized housing.\u201d But despite the law\u2019s stranglehold on rent, too many tenants still don\u2019t pay. As Goldenberg put it, \u201cWhat for?\u201d\n",

        "content": "The biggest proposed project of 2025 was not an apartment building or office tower. It was a casino.\nSteve Cohen\u2019s plan for a 3.8 million-square-foot gaming facility near Citi Field was the largest new development for which permits were filed with the city\u2019s Department of Buildings this year.\nTwo city jails, a hospital and a warehouse were also among the 10 largest projects proposed in 2025, an analysis of permit applications by\nThe Real Deal\nshows.\nFour of the top developments were residential, though one was a dormitory for college students. After the approval of the property tax break 485x, developers have increasingly favored apartment projects with 99 or fewer units, to avoid construction wage requirements that kick in at 100 units, and steeper rates at 150 units. That may explain why more residential projects didn\u2019t top\nTRD\n\u2019s list.\nOnly one office building made the cut: Vornado Realty Trust and Rudin Management\u2019s highly anticipated 350 Park Avenue. The project is a testament to the continued demand for class A, trophy office towers \u2014\u00a0and the importance of lining up an anchor tenant to get such a project off the ground.\nHere are the largest projects filed with DOB:\n121-09 Roosevelt Avenue, Queens\nThe competition for up to three state casino licenses in New York came to an end this month, with state officials\nselecting\nthree winners: Steve Cohen\u2019s Metropolitan Park, a facility planned near Citi Field; the complex at Bally\u2019s Golf Links at Ferry Point; and Resorts World\u2019s expansion of the Queens Aqueduct.\nOnly Cohen\u2019s $8 billion plan made the list of the largest project filings of 2025 (the other teams haven\u2019t filed applications as of the end of November). The development, which will rise on 50 acres of parking lots next to Citi Field, is expected to include a 1,000-room Hard Rock hotel and a 5,650-person live music venue.\n350 Park Avenue, Manhattan\nThree years ago, Vornado and Rudin announced that they had reached a deal with Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel that would allow the developers to build a massive office tower in Midtown East.\nSince then, the developers have\nrezoned\nthe site and\npurchased\nhundreds of thousands of\u00a0 square feet of air rights from St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and\nSt. Bartholomew\u2019s Church\n. In November of this year, they\nfiled\na permit application for a more than 2 million-square-foot building that will rise 62 stories.\nGriffin agreed in late 2022 to master lease the site, with Citadel and Citadel Securities set to occupy 850,000 square feet of the new tower. As part of the deal, Griffin has until June 2030 to either buy a majority stake in the joint venture developing the property (with Vornado and Rudin respectively taking a 36 and 4 percent interest) or to buy the site outright for $1.4 billion.\n357 Southern Boulevard/\n745 East 141st Street\n, Bronx\nIn October, the city\u2019s Department of Design and Construction filed plans for a new jail at the site of the former Lincoln Hospital and NYPD compound.\nThe facility is expected to span 1.1 million gross square feet, including 1,040 beds, 120 parking spaces and 40,000 square feet of commercial space.\nLast year, the city awarded a\n$2.9 billion design-build contract\nto an entity led by the Sweet Group to build the facility.\n45 West Street and 15 Oak Street, Brooklyn\nTF Cornerstone\nplans\nto build 1,060 residential units across two buildings on this Greenpoint waterfront site. The larger of the two, at 45 West Street, is expected to span 808,000 square feet and include 792 units.\nThe other is expected to have 268 units across 249,000 square feet.\n125 White Street, Manhattan\nThe city\u2019s DDC filed plans for the Manhattan jail in October. DOB filings indicate that the facility, which will be constructed on the site of a current detention center, will span more than 1 million square feet. It is expected to have 1,040 beds, 125 parking spots and 20,000 square feet of commercial space.\nThe city awarded a\n$3.8 billion contract\nto a joint venture led by Tutor Perini to build the facility.\n61-06 Junction Boulevard, Queens\nUnited Construction and Development Group filed plans in August for a two-tower residential project in Corona.\nUpdates filings call for 706 units across the two buildings, which will respectively rise 23 and 29 stories. Together, the projects are expected to span more than 960,000 square feet.\n431 East 66th Street, Manhattan\nA permit application filed for the Kenneth C. Griffin Pavilion at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer in November describes a 730,000-square-foot building on York Avenue between East 66th and East 67th streets. The hospital\u2019s new cancer center will rise more than 480 feet and feature 28 operating rooms and more than 200 patient beds.\nThe cancer center will eventually be connected with the existing hospital by a two-story skybridge.\n376 Schermerhorn Street, Brooklyn\nAlloy Development says its\nplanned\n730-foot tower on Schermerhorn Street, known as One Third Avenue, will be the world\u2019s tallest passive house. The building is expected to span nearly 640,000 square feet and 583 residential units, of which 143 will be affordable.\nThe developers are\nnot planning\nto apply for the property tax break 485x, but will instead make payments in lieu of taxes, or PILOTs.\nThe tower is part of a larger development, dubbed the Alloy Block, which will eventually include more than 1,000 homes, with 200 set aside as permanently affordable.\n2768 Webster Avenue, Bronx\nDeveloper Mark Stagg filed plans for a 545,000-square-foot dormitory for Fordham University students in November. The building is expected to include 510 dorms and is part of a broader development that will also feature 485 units of affordable housing.\nThe Stagg Group and Maddd Equities purchased two lots at 2740 and 2768 Webster Avenue for\n$40 million in April\n.\n12-18 38th Avenue, Long Island City\nSan Francisco-based real estate investment trust Prologis filed plans for a 500,000-square-foot warehouse in Long Island City in April.\nThe proposal came as the Adams administration began\nadvancing\na zoning text amendment that would require developers of last-mile facilities 50,000 square feet or larger to first secure a special permit. At the time, Prologis said the timing was a\ncoincidence\n.\nThe Adams administration did not begin the review process for the text amendment, meaning it will be up to the next administration to pick up on the effort.\n",

        "content": "Oak Row Equities and Vlad Doronin\u2019s OKO Group paid a record\n$520 million\nthis week for a Brickell assemblage they plan to develop with a hotel and branded condos.\nIt marked the biggest development site deal in South Florida and likely the state.\nThe pair purchased the 4.25-acre bayfront assemblage consisting of the 32-story Brickell Bay Office Tower at 1001 Brickell Bay Drive and the adjacent 31-story, 357-unit Yacht Club Apartments at 1111 Brickell Bay Drive in Miami. Mariposa Real Estate, which is tied to the Franklin family\u2019s Miami-based Mariposa Capital, led by Martin Franklin, also partnered on the deal.\nThe seller, Denver-based Aimco, has been unwinding its portfolio for the past year. Led by Wes Powell, Aimco is primarily a multifamily investor that last month announced its\nvoluntary liquidation\namid a slowing apartment market nationwide.\nAimco first listed the Brickell assemblage for\n$650 million\nin March of last year.\nOak Row \u2013\u2013 led by David Weitz and Erik Rutter and with offices in New York and Miami \u2013\u2013 put the site under contract a year ago, at the time only revealing Mariposa as a partner. OKO\u2019s partnering on the deal likely came later.\nIn past ventures, OKO Group has partnered with London-based Cain International on most of its projects, while Oak Row has had various partners for its developments. While Oak Row has primarily focused on apartment projects, OKO has developed condos and hotels. Both target the luxury market. Franklin\u2019s only known South Florida investment is his\n2022 purchase\nof a big minority stake in the Casa Tua hospitality firm.\nThis is the first known partnership between OKO and Oak Row. Here\u2019s a look at each firm\u2019s South Florida projects.\nOKO Group\n830 Brickell\nIn perhaps their most notable project, OKO and Cain completed the 57-story\n830 Brickell\noffice tower in Miami\u2019s Brickell last year.\nThe building, at 830 Brickell Plaza, benefitted from fortuitous timing because it was under construction during the pandemic era influx of out-of-state companies to South Florida. The new-to-market firms sought top tier offices and many leased big blocks of space at 830 Brickell, the newest standalone office tower in Brickell in over a decade.\nTenants include Microsoft; law firms\nKirkland &amp; Ellis\nand\nSidley Austin\n; Corient, formerly called\nCI Financial\n;\nThoma Bravo\n; Marsh Insurance and Santander Bank. OKO and The Bastion Collection, a subsidiary of Jamal Daniel\u2019sHouston-based Crest Investment Company, plan members-only club\nSeia\nwith an Italian restaurant on the 54th and 55th floors of 830 Brickell.\nMissoni Baia\nOKO and Cain developed the 57-story\nMissoni Baia\ncondo tower at 777 Northeast 26th Terrace in Miami\u2019s Edgewater.\nDesigned by Hani Rashid of Asymptote Architecture, the tower with 249 units was the first\u00a0 Missoni-branded residential building in the world at the time of its construction. Since then, the Italian luxury fashion house has branded several projects.\nUna Residences\nThe 47-story Una Residences has 135 condos in Miami\u2019s Brickell.\nOKO also partnered with Cain on the tower, at 175 Southeast 25th Road. It\u2019s designed by Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture.\nThe tower is nearly sold out, and completion is expected next year, an OKO representative said.\nAman Miami Beach\nOKO, in partnership with billionaire Len Blavatnik\u2019s Access Industries, plans the redevelopment of the historic Versailles structure in Miami Beach into an\nAman-branded project\n.\nThis year, construction started on the oceanfront project, at 3425 Collins Avenue, that will consist of a 56-key hotel in the Versailles structure, which is now a shell, and a new 18-story building with\n22 Aman-branded condos\n.\nThe project is sold out, and completion is expected in 2027, according to the OKO spokesperson.\nDoronin owns Aman Group, with its investors including Cain.\nPalm Beach Residences\nOKO and Cain have expanded their South Florida activity to Palm Beach.\nOn the barrier island, the pair plan a five-story, three-building oceanfront condo complex. In October, they scored\napproval\nfrom the Palm Beach Architectural Review Commission to demolish the existing condo buildings on the site, the Ambassador Palm Beach Hotel &amp; Residences, at 2730 South Ocean Boulevard, and Edgewater, at 2720 South Ocean Boulevard.\nDesigned by OMA, the project will include 41 units.\nAt an August meeting in front of the architectural commission, a project representative said the project will be\nbranded by Aman\n, but OKO has denied this will be an Aman-branded development.\nFort Lauderdale\nOKO\u2019s plan for the 34-story, 251-unit One River apartment tower in downtown Fort Lauderdale has stalled, and is the subject of a lawsuit.\nIn a\ncomplaint\nfiled in August, more than 40 investors in the project claimed the developer has failed to advance any \u201cmeaningful construction\u201d and is yet to secure a general contractor, three-plus years after obtaining a\n$97.2 million\nconstruction loan. The investors sued OKO, FPR Investor, the entity in which investors purchased a membership interest, and FPR US 1, the sponsor manager of FPR Investor. Cain is a partner in the project, and wasn\u2019t named as a defendant in the suit.\nThe investors allege FPR has been \u201cnothing more than a vehicle to raise money from investors and enrich defendants,\u201d according to the complaint.\nIn a statement, OKO denied the claims in the suit as \u201cfalse and without merit.\u201d OKO, FPR Investor and FPR US 1 also denied the allegations in a court response to the complaint.\nOak Row\nWynwood Plaza\nThis year, OKO completed the 1 million-square-foot mixed-use Wynwood Plaza project with a 12-story, 266,000-square-foot office building and a 12-story, 509-unit apartment building. The project is at 95 NW 29th Street in Miami\u2019s Wynwood.\nThe project partners are New York-based L&amp;L Holding Company, led by David Levinson and Robert Lapidus; San Francisco-based Shorenstein, led by Brandon Shorenstein; and Claure Group, led by Marcelo Claure. Claure is the former CEO of Sprint and SoftBank Group International.\nClaure Group leased a headquarters office at Wynwood Plaza. Amazon also took\n75,500 square\nfeet at the office building. Law firm Weitz &amp; Luxenberg \u2013\u2013 led by co-founding members Arthur Luxenberg and Perry Weitz, who is David Weitz\u2019s father and an Oak Row investor \u2013\u2013 leased a Wynwood Plaza office. Other tenants haven\u2019t been announced yet.\n2900 Terrace\nIn June, Oak Row scored a\n$210.5 million\nconstruction loan for the 38-story 2900 Terrace luxury apartment tower in Miami\u2019s Edgewater.\nThe 324-unit building is under construction on the northeast corner of Northeast 29th Street and Northeast Fourth Avenue. Alex Karakhanian\u2019s Lndmrk Development is partnering on the project.\nCompletion is expected in late 2027.\n2600 Biscayne\nOak Row landed a\n$181 million\nconstruction loan last year for the 41-story, 399-unit 2600 Biscayne apartment tower, also in Edgewater. It\u2019s under construction at 2600 Biscayne Boulevard.\nMore than half of the 187,000 square feet of commercial space at the tower is pre-leased, with Equinox signing up for\n30,700 square feet\n. Coastal Construction, 2600 Biscayne\u2019s general contractor, pre-leased space at the tower, where it will move its headquarters, and Ferraro Law Firm will move into a 28,000-square-foot office.\nFirst&amp;Fifth\nOak Row scored\napproval\nin January for the First&amp;Fifth apartment tower across the street from Brightline\u2019s MiamiCentral Station in downtown Miami.\nThe Miami Urban Development Board greenlit the project after taking issue with the tower\u2019s design last year. At the time, some board members\ncalled out\nwhat they said was a mismatch between the five-story podium, which had exterior arches, and the rest of the tower, and the incorporation of the historic Salvation Army Citadel building on the site instead of highlighting the building. The Salvation Army Citadel will be preserved.\nThe tower was approved for 45 stories and 526 apartments, though a recent Oak Row news release said the firm is finalizing the design.\nFirst&amp;Fifth will be at 49 Northwest Fifth Street and 50 Northwest Sixth Street.\nVenus\nIn 2022, before Oak Row had escalated to the upper echelons of Miami real estate, it revealed plans for the 26-story, 440-unit\nVenus\napartment tower in North Miami Beach.\nConstruction of the project, at\u00a0 2050 Northeast 164th Street, hasn\u2019t commenced. Oak Row is advancing in the permitting process, according to the company\u2019s news release announcing the Brickell assemblage purchase.\nThe Oasis\nOak Row\u2019s first known investment in Miami real estate came in 2018, when the firm paid\n$14 million\nfor a 1.7-acre development site at 2335 North Miami Avenue in Wynwood.\nAt the time, the real estate industry paid little attention to Rutter and Weitz, apparent novices in real estate investing. Their firm at the time was called Carpe Real Estate Partners, which they later rechristened to Oak Row, an homage to the oak trees that line the entrance to their Wynwood property.\nThe pair developed The Oasis mixed-use adaptive reuse project on the property, where\nSpotify\nleased space for its South Florida headquarters.\n",

        "content": "Trilogy Real Estate Group landed an $82.3 million construction loan for a planned multifamily tower in Miami\u2019s Edgewater.\nChicago-based Trilogy, led by president and CEO Neil Gehani, received the financing from Bank OZK, the South Florida Business Journal\nreported\n. The project, dubbed Edgewater 27, is slated for the 0.6-acre site at 2728 Northeast 2nd Avenue.\nTrilogy is a multifamily development and investment company with a portfolio that spans more than 14 cities. Trilogy\u2019s Gehani is also the founder and owner of the Concours Club in Opa-locka, a members-only car club where entry costs $350,000, according to published reports.\nTrilogy bought the site for\n$12.5 million\nin 2021, records show. Edgewater 27 is set to rise 20 stories, with 247 units and 8,000 square feet of commercial space, the outlet reported. Units will range from studio to three-bedroom apartments, Trilogy\u2019s website shows. The tower\u2019s amenities will include a pool, fitness center, lounge and coworking space. Trilogy tapped Coral Gables-based SB Architects to design the project.\nEdgewater 27 is one in a growing pipeline of projects for Trilogy in the neighborhood. In 2022, the firm dropped\n$30.6 million\non a 1.6-acre site at 2201 Northeast Second Avenue, an Opportunity Zone site, with plans for a 36-story tower. Trilogy is planning another multifamily development, the 369-unit Edgewater 23, for the site.\nIn June, Trilogy acquired Crescent Heights\u2019 Edgewater headquarters for\n$41.9 million\n. They are planning a mixed-use development with condos and apartments on the 2-acre site at 2200 Biscayne Boulevard. The project will rise up to 60 stories with 834 units that will include between 60 and 80 condos.\nEdgewater has been a magnet for development in recent years. In November, Black Salmon, the Boschetti Group and Constellation Group partnered with hospitality mogul Sam Nazarian to launch\nHQ Residences Miami\n, a planned 35-story, 229-unit condo tower.\n\u2013\u2013\nKate Hinsche\n",

        "content": "It may sound like a broken record at this point.\nA look at 2025\u2019s nine priciest deals had Beverly Hills-based Carolwood Estates\u2019 fingerprints all over them. Six of the nine transactions had Drew Fenton\u2019s brokerage involved in representing at least one side. That comes off a\n2024\nwhere Carolwood was involved in half of the year\u2019s 10 priciest deals.\nIn 2025, the brokerage can lay claim to being involved in the year\u2019s record sales of 594 South Mapleton Drive in Holmby Hills and 630 Nimes Road in Bel-Air. Each of the properties fetched $110 million to make for Los Angeles County\u2019s most expensive closings in 2025.\nWhile some have said the year proved to be more challenging in the County\u2019s high end, the following list, compiled by\nThe Real Deal\nResearch, shows what agents were able to still get deals done\u2013with some setting high-water marks while they were at it.\n1. 594 South Mapleton Drive, Holmby Hills | Eric and Wendy Schmidt | $110 million\nIt turns out 2025\u2019s magic number was $110 million.\nThe sale of\nSpelling Manor\nmade for the year\u2019s second trade for that price when it closed in July to tie for the year\u2019s priciest residential sale in Los Angeles County.\nCarolwood Estates double-ended the deal with CEO and co-founder Drew Fenton the listing agent on behalf of a reported Saudi national. Meanwhile, Carolwood\u2019s Linda May represented former Google CEO\nEric Schmidt and his wife Wendy\nin their purchase.\nThe Schmidts have plenty of room to work with in their new residence, with over 56,000 square feet. They won\u2019t have to travel far for their daily needs and entertainment. The Manor comes complete with bowling alleys, beauty salons, rose gardens to wander through, library and a professional screening room.\n2. 630 Nimes Road, Bel-Air | James Packer | $110 million\nAustralian billionaire\nJames Packer\nwas so excited over his purchase of the Le Belvedere residence in Bel-Air that he let slip to a\nhometown media outlet\nnews of the sale before it officially closed.\nThe former Crown Resorts chair snapped up\n630 Nimes Road\nin May to make for a 2025 record in LA County, holding the top spot alone until Spelling Manor traded for the same price a few months later.\nSome of the market\u2019s biggest names had a hand in getting the off-market deal done.\nPacker tapped Carolwood Estates\u2019 Drew Fenton and Westside Estate Agency co-founder Kurt Rappaport to represent himself in the deal.\nThe seller, a limited liability company tied to European Investment Management Services Inc. with headquarters in Los Angeles, was represented by Carolwood\u2019s Stephen Resnick, Jonathan Nash, David Parnes and James Harris.\n3. 28719 Grayfox Street, Malibu | PDPG LLC | $80 million\nWho ever heard of a surf shack selling for\n$80 million\n?\nIn Malibu, that\u2019s just another day and another deal\u2013altough it\u2019s notable that the late July closing marked the city\u2019s priciest for 2025.\nThe off-market trade was done quietly and involved two shell companies. On the buy side was PDPG LLC, which records trace to a Longview, Texas address.\nThe seller was a Wyoming LLC, called Surfwatch, managed by Wendy Schreiber Fiske, according to property and state records. The company is tied to a Santa Barbara address that Schreiber Fiske owns with Orlo James Fiske, chief technology officer of electric energy storage tech company Gravity Power.\nCompass\u2019 Chris Cortazzo represented both sides in the trade of the roughly 1,300-square foot home, sitting on a 1.4-acre lot. A second, vacant lot was also part of the deal.\n4. 10905 Chalon Road, Bel-Air | RoadX LLC | $67.5 million\nHidden from wandering eyes, behind privacy hedges running alongside the street, is the contemporary home once owned by Dara Mir.\nMir is the estranged husband of \u201cShahs of Sunset\u201d star Lilly Ghalichi, who filed for divorce earlier this year.\nThe businessman quietly sold the property at the end of June to a Delaware-registered limited liability company called RoadX.\nThe hillside property sits on a 1.6-acre lot, with the home spanning roughly 30,000 square feet and includes a sports court and subterranean parking.\nColdwell Banker Realty\u2019s Ben Y. Mason and\nJoyce Rey\nwere the listing agents, according to the Multiple Listing Service. The buyer was represented by attorney Nima Stephen Vokshori.\n5. 71 Beverly Park, Beverly Hills Post Office | Paris Hilton and Carter Reum | $63.1 million\nAnother celebrity couple made a move behind the gates of Beverly Park when\nParis Hilton\npaid $63.1 million for a mansion in the upscale community.\nHilton and husband Carter Reum reportedly bought the property from Gu Fang, who is married to Chinese billionaire Xu Hang, whose fortune comes from starting medical device maker Mindray Medical International.\nThe couple didn\u2019t hold the property for very long but appears to have made a tidy return on their investment. They bought it in 2023 for $55 million from actor\nMark Wahlberg and his wife Rhea Durham\n, who had originally sought\n$87.5 million\nfor the over 30,000-square-foot mansion in 2022.\nHilton tapped family to represent her and Reum in the deal: Barron N. Hilton and his wife Tessa Hilton, who were co-founders and co-CEOs of Hilton Hilton up until their departure from the brokerage to Compass in September.\nCompass\u2019 Ginger Glass and Alexandra Glass were the listing agents.\n6. 1028 Ridgedale Drive, Beverly Hills | Stancheck Capital LLC | $60 million\nWhat a year for\nJames Packer\n.\nNot only was the billionaire and son of late Australian media mogul Kerry Packer the buyer in a deal tied for No. 1 in Los Angeles County residential for 2025, but he preceded that trade about a month earlier with his sale of 1028 Ridgedale Drive. The April closing marked Beverly Hills\u2019 priciest residential sale of the year.\nThe property was once a rental for Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck. Before that, comedian couple Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman owned the residence for about two decades before they sold it for $26.6 million in 2015.\nPacker enlisted Westside Estate Agency\u2019s Kurt Rappaport and Carolwood Estates\u2019 Drew Fenton to represent him in the sale. Rappaport also represented the buyer.\nProperty and state records indicate the buyer is a shell company called Stancheck Capital, with a New York address tied to accounting firm Spritzer Kaufman.\n7. 391 North Carolwood Drive, Holmby Hills | David Zander | $57.3 million\nA 1920\u2019s Spanish Villa quietly made its way onto the market for the first time in more than 20 years before being sold in one of the year\u2019s pricier transactions.\nThe sellers were\nBradley Bell\n, executive producer and head writer for CBS soap \u201cThe Bold and the Beautiful,\u201d and his wife Colleen Bell, property records show. Colleen held several roles for \u201cThe Bold and the Beautiful,\u201d including director of special projects, and was later nominated in 2013 by President Obama to serve as ambassador to Hungary.\nThe couple sold the home in May to TV and film producer David Zander, according to property and state records.\nRevel Real Estate\u2019s Ben Bacal was the listing agent, while Carolwood Estates\u2019 Drew Fenton brought the buyer.\n8. 942 North Alpine Drive, Beverly Hills | 942 Alpine Peak | $51.8 million\nNapa Valley in Beverly Hills. That\u2019s what the late architect Howard Backen was going for with\nVilla Oliva\n, which nabbed a buyer to become one of the city\u2019s more expensive 2025 trades.\nThe over 12,000-square-foot estate counts six beds and seven baths, sitting on nearly an acre.\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\u2019s Aaron Kirman and Carolwood Estates\u2019 Linda May held the listing on behalf of a trust tied to Stephen Paul and his wife Nancy Paul. Stephen\u2019s family holds a minority stake in the Pittsburgh Steelers and also founded steel maker Ampco-Pittsburgh.\nThe buyer was a limited liability company called 942 Alpine Peak, which tracks to the NBC Tower at 455 North Cityfront Drive in Chicago, according to property and state records.\nCompass\u2019 Carl Gambino and John Bercsi brought the buyer in what was briefly Beverly Hills\u2019 most expensive trade before 1028 Ridgedale Drive sold later that same month.\n9. 11740 Crescenda Street, Brentwood | Davidson Construction LLC | $44 million\nWhen Milwaukee Brewers minority owner\nRobert Beyer\nsold his Brentwood home, nicknamed Ocho Manos, the purchase price was Brentwood\u2019s highest since a $57 million sale in late 2021 at 13058 Rivers Road.\nBeyer originally\nsought $75 million\nfor the 3.5-acre property and then later reduced the listing price a few times, with the most recent cut in June to $54.9 million.\nThe estate resulted from several parcel transactions and their assemblage\u00a0 before a new home was designed and built over the course of about five years. It was completed in 2005.\nProperty records show the seller was Davidson Construction. A state registration statement ties the company to Westlake Village business Transparent Accounting Solutions Inc. and its owner Evan Ingram.\nThe Beverly Hills Estates\u2019 Jack Harris and Michael Fahimian brought the buyer. Meanwhile, Carolwood Estates\u2019 Drew Fenton and Andrew Beyer, Beyer\u2019s son, were the listing agents.\n",

        "content": "San Francisco\u2019s priciest home sales in 2025 continue the previous year\u2019s trend\nIn 2024, the priciest home sold set a new record for San Francisco and came with a familiar resident. Laurene Powell Jobs, widow of Apple founder Steve Jobs, purchased a Broadway mansion in Pacific Heights for $71 million, more than 50 percent higher than the previous home buy record set in 2021.\nThis year, the highwater mark also sits on Broadway, just about 500 feet west of Jobs\u2019\u00a0 home. There were some departures from the trend, too, as this year\u2019s top deal went for tens of millions of dollars less, and the LLC on the purchasing documents was tied not to one of the Bay Area\u2019s tech titans but a Texas oil magnate.\nMany of the other priciest sales this year also followed 2024\u2019s general trend on the high end, with ultrawealthy homebuyers showing an affinity for the heights \u2014 Pacific Heights and Presidio Heights. Six of the top seven trades happened within 0.2 square miles. And, just as in 2024, a prominent sale along Sea Cliff Avenue helped to break up the high-priced home huddle.\nHere are San Francisco\u2019s most expensive home sales in 2025:\n2930 Broadway \u2013 $42 million\nThis Pacific Heights mansion\nmoved in October for $42 million. The property was sold by the estate of Brooks Walker Jr., a long-time business and civic leader who died last year at 96.\nThe 7,320-square-foot home was built in 1928 by famed San Francisco architect\u00a0 Arthur Brown Jr., who also counts\u00a0 San Francisco City Hall, the War Memorial Opera House and the Veteran Building to his credit.\nThe buyer was listed as HOS Pacific LLC, which is also listed as the owner of a home at 2600 Pacific Ave. The LLC has been tied to Joseph O\u2019Neill, a Texas oil and gas executive, real estate investor, and friend of George W. Bush.\n260 Sea Cliff Avenue \u2013 $30 million\nFrom the time\nthis seaside home sold for $30 million in January\n, this stood as the citywide high-water mark through much of the year, until getting topped by the above sale on Broadway.\nOut of all the high-end home sales in 2025,\u00a0 however, both sides of this transaction featured perhaps the highest profiles, and in its own way told the story of old San Francisco transitioning to new.\nFor four decades, the 8,300-square-foot home was owned by well-known developer Douglas Shorenstein, son of famous real estate executive Walter Shorenstein. Shorenstein bought the three-story mansion for $3 million in the 1980s. For years, actor and comedian Robin Williams lived around the corner.\nThe home was most recently owned by Shorenstein\u2019s daughter and owner of the Curran Theater, Carole Shorenstein Hays.\nSea Cliff House LLC bought the property in January. According to public records, Max Novendstern is listed as the manager of the LLC \u2014 a previously unreported fact. A Max Novendstern is also listed as the head of Worldcoin, a San Francisco-based cryptocurrency company he co-founded with OpenAI founder Sam Altman.\n2440 Pacific Avenue \u2013 $27.5 million\nThis 12,000-square-foot home saw an off-market sale in May. Built in 1906, the eight-bedroom, six bathroom Pacific Heights mansion was the only Pacific Avenue residence to make the list this year. The home includes a wine cellar, staff bedroom and bathroom, and an original carriage house.\nThe estate was sold by Lindsay Bolton, ex-wife of finance executive George Brown Bolton, who helped with Microsoft\u2019s and Oracle\u2019s IPOs in 1986. The buyer was the Aeonian Trust, which is managed by New York-based tax attorney Johsua Milgram at Dechert LLP.\n2990 Broadway \u2013 $26.5 million\nWhether you call it the Gold Coast or Billionaire\u2019s Row, the grand, historic stretch of mansions in Presidio Heights, Pacific Heights and the Sea Cliff neighborhoods are San Francisco\u2019s most desired. Yet, even on Billionaire\u2019s Row there are levels to the opulence, and this three-level home has long stood out as one of the most coveted.\nWhere many Gold Coast mansions were built in the early 20th century, this 10,100-square-foot home was custom built in 1987 for Bay Area power couple George \u201cFritz\u201d Jewett Jr., the heir to a logging fortune, and his wife, Lucy, a prominent supporter of the arts. Known as the last house on Outer Broadway, the home, designed by architect Sandy Walker, has panoramic views of the San Francisco Bay, with the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz and the Marin Headlands all within view.\nThe Jewetts had the house built later in their lives to entertain friends and guests. Names such as Prince Phillip, George H.W. Bush, and Nancy Pelosi have all visited the home.\nThe house was originally listed for $38 million when it went on the market in 2024. In March, CI Investments, a company associated with serial entrepreneur Kevin Rose.\n3701 Washington Street \u2013 $26 million\nBuilt in 1902, this 8,500-square-foot mansion sits two blocks from the Presidio Wall. The property was purchased in 2011 by William Matthes, a former managing partner at New York-based private equity firm Behrman Capital, and his wife, Leigh, an advisory board member for Stanford\u2019s School of Education Challenge Success program. The house, completely remodeled in the early 2000s, notably used as the stage for the San Francisco Decorator Showcase in 2006.\nThe property was purchased by Roxy Bear Trust, which is managed by David Geffon, the former head of games at Youtube.\n2006 Washington Street, Unit #10 \u2013 $24 million\nAmong the collection of single-family mansions, the 5,700-square-foot Pacific Heights property is the only unit in a multifamily building on this year\u2019s list.\nThe penthouse unit on this 11-story building was sold by Christopher Redlich, former CEO of Marine Terminals Company, a shipping and cargo firm. It apparently is also the lone home on the list that was sold at a markdown \u2014 Redlich bought the three-bedroom home for $32 million, and initially listed the unit for $35 million.\nThe unit underwent a major renovation at the hands of renowned architect and interior designer team Andrew Skurman and Suzanne Tucker. Jon Rubenstein, the engineer who helped develop Apple\u2019s iPod and iMac, also lives in the building, and recently listed his unit for $25.5 million.\nIn co-ops, buyers sign a lease to own the exclusive rights to occupy the unit, which creates more opacity around who actually lives in the space. Attorney James Burdette Parker signed the lease. His name has appeared on other\nco-op leases for anonymous buyers.\n2750 Vallejo Street \u2013 $22.5 million\nTroon Pacific renovated and sold this five-story, 7,800-square-foot Pacific Heights home in 2023 for $23.5 million \u2014 one of the top sales of that year.\nThe buyer, 2750 Vallejo Trust, managed by San Francisco wealth manager Tracy Keyser, turned around and sold the property this year for a slight loss. The buyer was Lomax Trust, managed by Lonnie Dorn of San Francisco-based Clear Rock Capital Partners.\nTroon Pacific, the seller in 2023, has made recent headlines. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman bought his Russian Hill mansion from the company in 2020. However, Altman has apparently run into issues with the home, and accused Troon Pacific of selling him a \u201clemon\u201d in a still-open lawsuit.\n",

        "content": "A frenzy of multifamily sales in Chicago boosted the commercial real estate market in the second half of the year.\nMultifamily sales made up eight out of the 10 priciest sales in Cook County this year, data compiled by\nThe Real Deal\nshows. All but one of those multifamily sales took place in the third or fourth quarter of the year.\nStill, two industrial properties traded in high-profile deals, including the priciest commercial sale of 2025.\nThe highest dollar transaction in Cook County this year was High Street Logistics\u2019 sale of a $270 million industrial portfolio in the Northwest suburbs to NorthPoint Development,\nTRD\nfound. It was the only sale that came in over $200 million.\nIn 2024, by comparison, Cook County\u2019s top three sales all\ncame in well over $200 million\n, with\nthe $504 million sale of the Sheraton Grand Riverwalk\nhotel topping the list.\nDespite lackluster sales on the priciest end of the market, Cook County still recorded a solid flow of deals between the $100 million and $200 million range. Multifamily deals dominated the market, as the region\nexperienced rent growth that outpaced most of the U.S\n.\nMuch of that is due to a historically low supply of new multifamily developments hitting the market. Construction has been slowed by high interest rates and construction costs coupled with\nrestrictive city policies\nand\na challenging property tax environment\nin Cook County.\nWhile developers may be struggling to get new projects started in Chicago, the limited supply of new properties started to draw investors during the second half of the year.\nContinuing that momentum, already an early contender exists for top commercial sale of the year for 2026. Apartment Investment and Management Company, better known as Aimco, announced Dec. 15 that\nthe firm is selling its portfolio of seven rental complexes\nacross the Chicago area for $455 million.\nThe sale to LaTerra Capital, based in Marina Del Ray, California, and Respark Residential, based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is set to close in the first quarter of 2026. It is part of Denver-based Aimco\u2019s\nbroader plans to liquidate\nand wind down operations.\nHere are the top commercial deals of 2025, based on\nTRD\nresearch:\nHigh Street Elgin industrial portfolio | $270 million\nNorthPoint Development\u2019s $270 million investment in Elgin in June nabbed the top spot for the priciest commercial sale of the year and was one of the most expensive industrial real estate purchases in the Chicago area in recent memory.\nThe Kansas City-based firm\nbought a portfolio of about a dozen warehouses\nspanning 2.8 million square feet in the northwest Chicago suburb, paying about $96 per square foot, public records show. Massachusetts-based seller High Street Logistics cashed in on an upswing in the region\u2019s industrial market with the sale.\nNorthPoint, founded by former Trammell Crow executive Robert Chagares 23 years ago, bought the portfolio for about $230 million in 2021.\nNorth Water Apartments | $175 million\nAmid a Chicagoland buying spree, FPA Multifamily purchased\nthe North Water Apartments\nfor $175 million in December.\nTrinity Property Consultants, a firm with ties to Greg Fowler\u2019s FPA Multifamily, bought the 398-unit apartment building at 340 East North Water Street from Miami-based developer Crescent Heights. The deal includes only the multifamily portion of the building \u2014 a 400-room Loews hotel occupies the rest of the building.\nCrescent Heights secured a $112 million Freddie Mac loan on the building in 2023 at an interest rate of 5.5 percent, maturing in July 2028, and it was assumable by a buyer. That was likely a selling point for FPA, offering relief from higher interest rates in today\u2019s market.\nWhen the building hit the market earlier in the year, the property was listed as 93 percent occupied, with average rents of $3,574 per unit. Newmark brokers Liz Gagliardi, Chuck Johanns and Susan Lawson represented Crescent Heights on the listing.\nFor FPA, the North Water Apartments acquisition was the latest in a flurry of activity for the firm across the Chicago area.\nThe San Francisco-based company bought a Naperville apartment complex in March for $68 million, a month after it sold\na Downers Grove building to Laramar Group\n. FPA also\npurchased a 500-unit South Loop building\nin March 2024 for $144 million, following that with\na $60 million Oak Park tower\nin July 2024, and\nanother Oak Park acquisition\nin August of that year.\nFulbrix Apartments | $170 million\nMoceri &amp; Roszak sold a Fulton Market apartment development for $170 million in April, snagging a win after the firm\u2019s struggle in the office sector.\nA venture of New York-based Normandy Real Estate\nacquired the 27-story, 375-unit Fulbrix Apartments at 160 North Elizabeth Stree\nt from developer Moceri &amp; Roszak and equity partner Ares Management. The price equated to $453,000 per unit.\nEastdil Secured brokers Bryan Rosenberg and Donald Kelly represented the sellers. The buyers scored a $120 million Fannie Mae loan originated by Greystone\u2019s Eric Rosenstock and Jesse Yodice. It\u2019s a 10-year loan term with seven years of interest-only payments.\nMoceri &amp; Roszak completed the building in 2023. The buyer, Normandy Real Estate, is reportedly connected to the group that purchased McDonald\u2019s global headquarters in Fulton Market in 2020, which was a high-profile vote of confidence in the corridor\u2019s long-term potential.\nLeft Bank at K Station | $151 million\nHouston-based Hines added to its growing Chicago multifamily portfolio by buying\nthe Left Bank at K Station\napartment tower for $151 million in November.\nA venture of New Jersey-based PGIM Real Estate sold the 37-story, 451-unit building at 300 North Canal Street in West Loop to a Hines-affiliated fund, according to Cook County property records. The sale amounted to $335,000 per unit.\nThe deal was brokered by JLL\u2019s Mark Stern, Kevin Girard and Zachary Kaufman.\nPGIM put the tower on the market in June, one of several downtown multifamily listings this year, as strong rent growth and minimal new supply enticed investors back into the market.\nCompleted in 2006 by PGIM and Chicago-based Fifield Companies, Left Bank sits near the confluence of the Chicago River and marks one of the earliest residential components of Fifield\u2019s master-planned K Station community, which also includes the K2, Echelon and Alta towers. PGIM later bought out Fifield\u2019s stake in 2007.\nJLL\u2019s marketing materials touted an opportunity for upgrades, noting that about 17 percent of units have yet to be modernized \u2014 a potential value-add play for Hines, which has been expanding its residential portfolio nationally.\nRents at Left Bank ranged from $2,432 for studios to $4,162 for two-bedrooms when the property hit the market.\nFifteen 98 | $136 million\nAmid a busy year for suburban sales, a New Jersey-based firm joined in on the action in August.\nThe Solomon Organization\nbought the 640-unit Fifteen 98 Naperville,\nat 1598 Fairway Drive, from San Francisco-based FPA Multifamily, DuPage County property records show.\nThe $136 million sale price equated to $212,500 per unit.\nFPA had paid $98.5 million for the 34-acre property in 2017.\nSolomon, based in Summit, New Jersey, controls about 21,000 units across nine states.\nThe firm financed the Naperville buy with a $91 million loan from Berkadia Commercial Mortgage. The property built in 1984\u00a0 \u2014 formerly known as the Addison of Naperville \u2014 includes 39 low-rise buildings with a 6.6 percent vacancy rate. Asking rents average $1,879 a month, or $2.11 per square foot, according to CoStar.\nMilieu | $134 million\nAmli Residential made a purchase in December to make the list of top commercial transactions of 2025.\nThe Chicago-based\nfirm paid more than $134 million for Milieu\n, a 19-story, 275-unit apartment tower at 205 South Peoria Street in the West Loop.\nSeller Pacific Life Insurance developed the tower and completed it in 2019. The company partnered with White Oak Realty Partners and Crayton Advisors on the project. Pacific Life later bought out its partners and financed the property with an $86 million loan in 2021, Cook County records show.\nMilieu includes 215 parking spaces, a rooftop pool and deck and a full slate of amenities. When JLL brought the property to market in July, occupancy stood at 96 percent, with new leases signed at 5 percent rent increases, year-to-date, according to marketing materials.\nThe building is in the West Loop neighborhood which has become one of the city\u2019s most competitive submarkets. Interest in the area is driven by recent office conversions, an uptick in the dining scene and its proximity to Fulton Market.\nOne East Delaware | $130 million\nA California investor scooped up one of the Gold Coast\u2019s marquee apartment towers, closing a nine-figure deal that underscored the strength of Chicago\u2019s rental market and the painful price resets that are still rippling through the city\u2019s investment landscape.\nSan Francisco-based\nFriedkin Property Group paid $130 million for the 26-story, 304-unit One East Delaware\nin November, according to Cook County records. It marks one of downtown\u2019s priciest multifamily trades of the year, yet still a steep markdown from the sellers.\nThe building at 1 East Delaware Place was sold by a venture of Golub &amp; Co. and Alcion Ventures, which bought it for $146 million in 2016 and later poured another $30 million into renovations. JLL\u2019s Mark Stern, Kevin Girard and Zachary Kaufman brokered the deal.\nThe building also offers 37,000-square-feet of retail space that is 87 percent leased.\nThe Golub-Alcion venture refinanced the property in late 2021 with a $113.5 million loan that was scheduled to mature in November 2024. Whether the lenders provided an extension was unclear, but the clock was ticking.\nBuffalo Grove, Elgin and Vernon Hills industrial portfolio | $102 million\nSilverman Group began the year by doubling the size of its Chicagoland commercial property portfolio.\nIn January, the New Jersey-based real estate investment\nfirm spent about $102 million on a 925,000-square-foot collection of low-rise buildings\naimed at light industrial and office tenants in the northern and northwest suburbs of Chicago, public records show. The price was about $110 per square foot.\nThe seller was San Francisco-based Stockbridge Capital Group, which has offloaded a series of Chicago-area industrial, multifamily and office investments in recent years. Stockbridge paid $63.4 million ($69 per square foot) to buy the buildings in 2019, property records show.\nThe properties are in Buffalo Grove, Vernon Hills and Elgin and include 17 buildings that were 92 percent leased at the time of sale. The deal brings Silverman\u2019s Chicago-area portfolio to just under 2 million square feet, according to a news release.\nMike Tenteris, Adam Tyler and Jim Carpenter with Cushman &amp; Wakefield represented Stockbridge in its sale to Silverman.\nAlgonquin Commons | $100 million\nA suburban turnaround led by a California-based retail redevelopment specialist paid off for the seller.\nRed Mountain Group and investment partner F&amp;F Capital sold the Algonquin Commons shopping center\nto Nuveen for $100 million\nin September, four years after buying the site for $33 million. The prior owners, Inland Real Estate, gave it up via a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.\nBut Nuveen didn\u2019t necessarily overpay either. Inland bought the property for $154 million in 2006 before the Great Recession led to several store closings and ultimately Inland\u2019s default.\nThe Red Mountain joint venture spent the last few years on a $30 million plan to bring the once struggling shopping center back to life.\nThe California-based company quickly attracted new tenants, including The Fresh Market, Bob\u2019s Discount Furniture and a Twin Peaks restaurant. Over the past four years, the shopping center has gone from 60 percent to 94 percent occupied, according to Red Mountain. The firm put the property on the market late last year.\nNewmark\u2019s Bill Bauman, Kyle Miller, Keely Polczynski and Conor Lalor represented Red Mountain and F&amp;F in the sale.\nThe Mil\u2019Ton | $100 million\nA longtime Chicago investor eyed opportunities in the suburbs this year.\nTLC Management purchased a Vernon Hills apartment complex for $100 million in August.\nInvestor Stuart Handler\u2019s Chicago-based company\nacquired The Mil\u2019Ton,\na 294-unit, three-building property at 1155 Museum Boulevard, from financial services firm Mesirow, according to property records. The price amounted to $340,100 per unit.\nMesirow bought the complex in 2018 for $87.1 million and listed it in March with CBRE brokers John Jaeger, Justin Puppi, Jason Zyck, Jillian Jaeger and Tricia Carolan.\nThe firm rebranded the property as The Majestic Luxury Apartments after a round of amenity renovations that included the clubhouse, gym, coworking areas, yoga space and pool. The seven-story complex, built in 2004, is 94 percent occupied with asking rents averaging nearly $3,000 a month.\nMesirow is doubling down on multifamily. The firm announced in May it had raised $1.25 billion for a new national apartment fund, a 66 percent increase, with plans to target top-tier markets across the U.S.",

        "content": "The year 2025 began with a wave of wildfires that tore through the region, leaving scars that still haven\u2019t healed as rebuilding crawls forward in the Pacific Palisades and Altadena.\nMayor Karen Bass came under fire for\ntraveling to Africa\nduring the windstorm that preceded January\u2019s deadly Los Angeles wildfires, despite receiving advanced warnings from weather officials. She has also been accused of mishandling the aftermath. It wasn\u2019t until the end of November the\nfirst rebuild\nin the Palisades was ready for occupancy.\nVarious people and entities jumped in to help with fire recovery, including Rick Caruso, the billionaire real estate developer who\nfounded Steadfast L.A.\n(He managed to save his own retail center in the Palisades by hiring private firefighters.)\nMeasure ULA continued to rankle industry pros with agents saying it impacted deals across the board and multifamily\ndevelopers talking about pivoting\naway from new construction in the City of Los Angeles.\n\u201cThe math ain\u2019t mathing,\u201d said LaTerra Development\u2019s Chris Tourtellotte on developing new apartment buildings in the City of Los Angeles, at\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s inaugural\nL.A. roundtable event\nin September.\nLocal and state politicians tried to find ways to amend the so-called \u201cmansion tax,\u201d which since April 2023 has imposed a 4 percent tax on property sales above $5 million and 5.5 percent on transactions totaling more than $10 million. Bass asked the L.A. City Council to\nroll it back\ntemporarily for Palisades victims, which led to a Los Angeles City Council committee\nvoting in November\nto explore that. State politicians sought \u2014 and \u2014 failed to\ncut tax rates\nfor some newly built multifamily and commercial properties.\n\u201cIt\u2019s continuing to be challenging and they really need to fix it because it\u2019s the crux of the issues today when we\u2019re selling anything residential, even commercial, it comes up and it really has probably stopped 50 percent of the deals, maybe even more,\u201d\nAaron Kirman\n, CEO of Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California, said at\nTRD\n\u2019s event.\nVertical construction for the $10 million One Beverly Hills, near the intersection of Santa Monica and Wilshire boulevards, commenced at the end of November, a milestone celebrated by the City of Beverly Hills and the project\u2019s developers. The two-tower mixed-use development includes residences, an Aman Beverly Hill hotel, up to 45 stores and restaurants and 10 acres of botanical gardens and open space. Beverly Hills Mayor Sharona Nazarian told the\nLos Angeles Times\nthe project is \u201can important addition to Beverly Hills.\u201d\nAlso in Beverly Hills, developer Leo Pustilnikov scored a potentially far-reaching victory when a Los Angeles County superior court judge ruled that the city\nviolated state housing law\nby attempting to block his 19-story, 165-unit apartment building with a hotel and restaurant. The ruling forced the city to resume review of the developer\u2019s project and may impact Beverly Hills\u2019 strategy for blocking other builder\u2019s remedy projects, a California legal loophole allowing developers to override local planning when cities fail to adopt a timely and compliant local housing plan.\nDowntown Los Angeles grappled with a slow recovery in 2025 due to pandemic-related issues, immigration raids and subsequent protests, like the \u201cNo Kings\u201d day of action against the Trump administration.\nDozens of people were arrested following a large-scale U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid in the Los Angeles Fashion District on June 6. The raids\ncreated question marks\naround the state\u2019s homebuilding industry, which was already facing labor shortages. Protests resulted in violence, including the destruction of property, attacks on law enforcement and freeway blockades.\nThere was a glimmer of hope for Downtown L.A. when\nTRD\nreported\nin August that there were two serious buyers vying for Oceanwide Plaza and a deal was expected to close by the end of the year. That didn\u2019t happen and the half-built abandoned eyesore\u2019s future remains uncertain.\nOf course the year was not without some celebrity news and interpersonal industry drama that drew reader interest.\nBeyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z took out a\nsecond $57.75 million mortgage\non their Bel Air mansion, bringing the total amount borrowed on the property to around $110.6 million.\n\u201cMillion Dollar Listing Los Angeles\u201d agent Josh Flagg\nsued\nhis former boss, Stephen Kotler, over alleged hacking. \u201cMillion Dollar Listing\u201d star Tracy Tutor\ndeparted\nDouglas Elliman for Compass after turbulence at the former firm. And billionaire developer Donald Bren\ndisavowed his son\n, David Bren, in the wake of lawsuits in which the younger Bren allegedly used his family name to sell fake Beverly Hills club memberships.\n",

        "content": "\u201cThe Comeback\u201d tickled Bay Area readers and\nstorytellers\nthroughout 2025.\nThe trendline has been particularly pronounced in San Francisco, where observers not so long ago wondered whether the city would ever recover from the pandemic.\nThen came the burgeoning artificial intelligence industry to thrust the gold rush town into its latest boom. Employers began\ncalling workers back to the office en masse\n, pulling the city out of\nits extended work-from-home malaise\n. Sleepy neighborhoods such as the Outer Sunset awoke to new interest, and\nbecame one of the city\u2019s most competitive housing submarkets\nthanks to new shops and restaurants, as well as \u201cwhite collar surfers\u201d seeking to enjoy San Francisco\u2019s beachy side.\nTourism even got some shoring up to its\u00a0 precarious footing, as evinced by\nBlackstone\u2019s move on the downtown Four Seasons hotel,\nwhich it bought for a song at $130 million. As one hotel executive said during an industry panel earlier this month, once Blackstone shows interest in hotels, it was\u00a0 a good sign for the market.\nIn this comeback story, first-year Mayor Daniel Lurie has assumed the dual role of protagonist-evangelist. He\nsat down with The Real Deal in June\n, and talked about the importance of getting a handle on public safety as well as \u201cthe perception\u201d of public safety. He also touted his \u201cFamily Zoning Plan\u201d which upzoned a majority of the city for the first time in decades. The vibes, the mayor said, are high.\nOf course, a comeback story requires something to overcome. After shaping the post-pandemic Bay Area narrative, \u201cThe Struggle\u201d still reared its head for readers in 2025.\nThe San Francisco Centre Mall best encapsulated this archetype. Once a trophy asset situated in the center of a great American city, it more recently has sparked wonderment over\nhow low the shopping center\u2019s value could fall.\nAt more than 90 percent vacant, it eventually went back to\nits lenders for $133 million,\na fraction of its one-time $1.2 billion valuation. Whether the mall can have its own comeback story will be a continuing curiosity of 2026.\nThe mall wasn\u2019t the only property to return to its lenders at a loss. According to experts, one-third of distressed borrowers in San Francisco were\nopting for deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure,\nin which they hand their properties back to their lenders to avoid costly foreclosure proceedings. However, developers were jumping in on deals as well. The buzziest buy was perhaps local firm RedCo\u2019s\npurchase of the Wells Fargo Building at 420 Montgomery Street for $55 million\n. It came on a heavy discount for the 12-story office building, a property in which Wells Fargo Bank had invested more than $90 million in renovations over the last decade.\n\u201cMovements of the Wealthy\u201d continues to be another alluring story line. On television, look no further than The Kardashians or the Real Housewives franchise. In real estate, look to Atherton, the Silicon Valley community where $15 million home sales hardly move an eyebrow. However, $51.5 million still means something in the elite enclave\u2013and that\u2019s how\u00a0 much former Seagate Technology CEO Stephen Luczo and his wife, fashion model Agatha Relota Luczo, got for\ntheir Atherton mansion in March\n. The off-market sale might have been Atherton\u2019s highest of 2025, but it was trounced by Green Gables,\na century-old Woodside estate that sold in September for $85 million\n, topping the list of the Bay Area\u2019s most expensive home sales this year.\nClose observations of the rich and famous extended into San Francisco as well. The Shorensteins, one of the city\u2019s best-known real estate families,\nsold their 8,300-square-foot home in the Sea Cliff neighborhood for $30 million\nin January, about 10 times what they paid in 1988. In January, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman\nbought three properties next to his Russian Hill mansion\nfor $14 million according to city records.\nIt\u2019s not just home ownership, either. In June,\nThe Real Deal\nreported that the luxury home rental market has been\n\u201cabsolutely insane\u201d in 2025\n. Leasing agents say the rush for homes at $10,000 to $35,000 per month has been driven by low inventory and more high-income renters returning to the city as more employers have called workers back to the office.\nLast but not least, we have \u201cThe Scandal.\u201d Who doesn\u2019t love reading about a good scandal? Readers particularly enjoyed\nthe scandal of Alexander Beckman\n, the former CEO of the AI company GameOn who allegedly defrauded investors out of $60 million and used the money with his wife to buy two homes in Presidio Heights. Then there was the fall of local Bay Area developer Kenneth Mattson, who in May was\ncuffed by federal agents in a Napa parking lot for allegedly leading\u00a0 a Ponzi scheme\nthat cheated senior citizens and churchgoers out of $46 million.\nYet real estate mogul Michael Shvo\u2019s legal trouble may bring the greatest consequence to Bay Area real estate. In November, Shvo, whose company SHVO rose to prominence in San Francisco after investing $1 billion to buy and revitalize the Transamerica Pyramid, was accused of\nrunning a yearslong Racketeer Influenced Crime Organization (RICO) conspiracy\n. In a lawsuit, Shvo is alleged to have misled \u201cinvestors, condo purchasers, tenants, and business partners into multi-million dollar transactions, the proceeds of which were diverted to enrich Shvo and his associates, and to fund their lavish lifestyles.\u201d The lawsuit was only the latest drama for Shvo in 2025, who has had to fight a barrage of lawsuits, and drew attention for his dramatic exit from a high-profile Miami Beach development.\n",

        "content": "South Florida\u2019s largest retail trades of 2025 were headlined by Simon Property Group\u2019s purchase of Brickell City Centre\u2019s shops and a wave of institutional capital targeting grocery-anchored centers and lifestyle assets from Miami\u2019s urban core to Palm Beach County suburbs.\nThe 10 biggest deals totaled more than $1.2 billion, a significant bump in transaction volume compared to 2024 when the top ten deals totaled\n$556 million\n. Investors were willing to pay high prices per square foot for well-leased retail assets with strong tenant rosters.\u200b\n1. $512M | Brickell City Centre | Simon Property Group\nIndianapolis-based Simon, led by CEO David Simon, claimed the most-expensive retail purchase with a takeover of the 500,000-square-foot retail mall at Brickell City Centre. Simon bought partner Swire Properties\u2019 75 percent stake for $512.6 million. The acquisition, at about $1,367 per square foot, gave Simon control of one of Miami\u2019s highest-profile mixed-use shopping destinations in the heart of Brickell.\n2. $133M | Marketplace at the Outlets | Invesco Real Estate\nComing in second place is Invesco Real Estate\u2019s $133.25 million acquisition of Marketplace at the Outlets, a 303,800-square-foot open-air center in West Palm Beach. The June deal breaks down to $439 per square foot, and the price was roughly $3 million above the sale price three years ago. Atlanta-based Invesco, led by CEO Andrew Schlossberg, assumed a $79 million loan in the transaction. The seller, billionaire Barry Sternlicht\u2019s Starwood Capital Group, paid $130 million for the Whole Foods-anchored shopping center in 2022. \u200b\n3. $131M | Abbey at Aventura | Turnberry, Simon Property Group\nTurnberry and Simon teamed up for this purchase, acquiring Esplanade at Aventura, and renaming the outdoor office and retail center The Abbey at Aventura. The joint venture, which also owns the adjacent Aventura Mall, paid $131 million, or $600 a square foot, for the 219,000-square-foot property. The seller, New York-based Seritage Growth Properties, completed the retail center on the site of a former Sears big box store.\n4. $118M | Uptown Boca | Stockbridge Capital\nStockbridge Capital Group, led by Terry Fancher, picked up the retail component of Uptown Boca, a mixed-use project in Boca Raton, for $118.4 million. Anchored by a Whole Foods, the 194,900-square-foot shopping center traded for $607 per square foot. The seller, a partnership between Giles Capital Group, Rosemurgy Properties, Schmier Property Group and Wheelock Street Capital, developed Uptown Boca, which included a seven-building multifamily complex that the joint venture sold in 2021.\n5. $110M | Atlas Plaza | Pontegadea\nSpanish billionaire Amancio Ortega\u2019s Pontegadea dropped $110 Million for Atlas Plaza in the Miami Design District in the fifth-biggest retail transaction of 2025. Pontegadea paid $5,500 a square foot for a 20,000-square-foot retail building that includes longtime Design District restaurant Michael\u2019s Genuine and a Rolex store. A partnership between David Edelsterin\u2019s Tricap, Aby Rosen\u2019s RFR and Commerz Real AG sold Atlas Plaza for $60 million above its sale price a decade ago, underscoring the Design District\u2019s emergence as a luxury retail destination. The seller paid $50 million in 2015.\n6. $88M | CityPlace Doral | Continental Realty Corporation\nBaltimore-based Continental Realty Corp made its first plunge into the South Florida retail market this year. Continental, led by CEO JM Shapiro, acquired CityPlace Doral, a multi-level 235,100-square-foot open-air center in Doral, for $87.5 million, or $372 a square foot. The seller, PGIM Real Estate, co-developed CityPlace Doral, a development that also included two apartment buildings, with Coconut Grove-based Related Group and Coral Gables-based Shoma Group. The retail component is anchored by a Fresh Market store and CMX CineBistro.\n7. $83M | Polo Club Shops | Publix\nPublix went on a South Florida shopping spree this year, buying up retail centers where it has stores. The Lakeland-based grocery chain paid $83 million for Polo Club Shops in Boca Raton. The sale breaks down to $616 a square foot. Publix acquired the 134,800-square-foot retail plaza for $32 million above the sale price a decade ago. Jamestown paid $50.6 million in 2015.\n8. $73M | Galleria Fort Lauderdale | GFO Investments and partners\nA partnership of GFO Investments, InSite Group, Atlas Hill Real Estate and Prime Finance bought Galleria Fort Lauderdale for $73 million. The 799,900-square-foot mall sits on 31.6 acres in Fort Lauderdale that the joint venture plans to redevelop into nine 30-story towers offering about 3,000 housing apartments, a hotel and room for retail, restaurants and office space. The price amounts to $2.3 million per acre.

        "content": "Austin\u2019s residential market declined this year\n, but the average price of the top 10 public home sales is higher than it was in 2024. Why?\nIt\u2019s not that Austin is a\nK-shaped\nmarket, with luxury rising while the lower tiers sink. Home prices have fallen across all tiers in Austin\nsince 2022\n, according to the\nTexas Real Estate Research Center\n.\nInstead, the trend may be due to\nAustin\u2019s uniquely robust private market\n, which agents say has been losing high-value homes to the Multiple Listing Service this year.\nAustin has always relished secrecy\n. Dallas-Fort Worth has Billy Bob\u2019s, the world\u2019s biggest honky-tonk; Austin has the Cloak Room, a literally underground speakeasy near the Capitol tunnels. While DFW has Reunion Tower, Austin\u2019s most iconic symbols are alley murals, like Jeremiah the Frog near the University of Texas and the \u201ci love you so much\u201d inscription on South Congress.\nAccordingly,\nAustin has perhaps the most thriving off-market real estate scene in Texas\n. That\u2019s why the biggest public sales of 2025, topping out at $17 million, shrink beside the private deals that have occasionally entered the spotlight, like\nEmma Stone\u2019s $23.5 million home in Tarrytown\n, or\nRoss Moody\u2019s Westlake purchase that almost certainly exceeded $20 million\n.\nHowever,\nAustin is now in a buyer\u2019s market\n, and even luxury sellers are feeling the change. Homes that would have normally sold off-market are increasingly going public, trading the tax advantages of privacy for the competitive boost of exposure.\nWho knows?\nAs more homes above $10 million trickle to the MLS\n, a continued downturn might bring bigger sales to next year\u2019s ranking.\nAll prices below are asking prices; final sales prices are undisclosed.\n13330 Shore Vista Drive | $16.9 million\nThe biggest public sale of the year was also the first.\nA Lake Austin estate at 13330 Shore Vista Drive went under contract on New Year\u2019s Eve\nand closed in February after last listing for almost $17 million, or about $2,000 per square foot for the 8,220-square-foot home. The estate of Abilene insurance agent William Kiker, who in 2021 bought the home from Moody International Companies CEO Brett Moody, sold it to an LLC managed by a David J. Miller for an undisclosed price.\nBuilt in 2013 on 3.17 acres, the five-bedroom, seven-bathroom property is west of Austin proper on the Colorado River, near Horseshoe Bay. The listing paragraph offered the rare amenity of access \u201cby air, land or water, as helicopter landings are allowed.\u201d\nKuper Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agent Bridget Ramey had the listing.\n3500 Bunny Run | $13 million\nWith five bedrooms, seven bathrooms and 8,600 square feet, the second-place home is comparable in size and location to the frontrunner. However, the property at 3500 Bunny Run isn\u2019t quite on the river, and the lot is about half the size at 1.64 acres. Its listing price of $13 million comes down to about $1,000 per square foot. Compass Real Estate agents Saira Ukani and Ross Speed marketed the property, which sellers Darren Kocs and Beth Hellerstedt sold in May to Kalan Wagner.\n907 Terrace Mountain Drive | $9.6 million\nMoreland Properties agent Cord Shiflet audaciously marketed the West Lake Hills home at 907 Terrace Mountain Drive with just one full sentence: \u201cDick Clark, architect. John Luce, builder. They say a picture is worth 1,000 words so I\u2019ll just stop here.\u201d With four bedrooms, five bathrooms, a lot under an acre and 4,700 square feet, the value of this home lies in its historically significant design and its location in West Lake Hills, a neighborhood west of the city in the bow of the Colorado River between Highway 360 and Mopac. The listing price amounts to about $1,500 per square foot.\nA trust held by inventor Harold Shockley sold the home to another trust registered to investor and former publisher Sandra Cunningham in February, according to public records.\n1401 North Weston Lane | $9 million\nThis West Lake waterfront home just missed the\nAustin tech boom of 2021 and 2022\n. The sellers, Paul and Jennifer Gregory, listed the house for $13 million in May of 2023 and cut the price several times that year. They took the home off the market until May 2025, when it was listed for $9.4 million. The 5,600-square-foot home finally sold in September with an asking price just under $9 million, about $1,600 per square foot, to a trust connected to Joseph Lum. Eric Moreland of Moreland Properties had the listing.\n5009 Spanish Oaks Club Boulevard | $9 million\nIt helps to be near a golf course\n. The Spanish Oaks neighborhood is a guard-gated community by the Spanish Oaks Golf Club, offering easy access for whoever leads The Perseverance Trust, which bought the property from Norman and Cecilia Davis in April, according to public records.\nThe $9 million listing price for the 10,000-square-foot contemporary comes down to about $890 per square foot.\nThe Davises bought and sold the property at inopportune moments,\nthough some of their neighbors have fared worse\n. The six-bedroom, seven-bathroom home last traded in 2022, the\npeak\nof the\nhoneymoon phase\nbetween Austin and the big tech industry.\nPeyton Tomson of The Agency Austin had the listing.\n5217 South Scout Island Circle | $8.5 million\nBilled by Kuper Sotheby\u2019s agents Joseph Longton and Kirk Lewis as Austin\u2019s \u201cmost spectacular waterfront home under $9 million,\u201d this four-bedroom, five-bathroom property asked about $1,400 per square foot for almost 6,200 square feet on a third of an acre. Seller John Reardon sold the property to an LLC in September, according to public records.\n200 Congress Avenue, Unit 50T | $8.3 million\nThe only condo on the list is also the first deal east of Texas State Highway Loop 1, better known as Mopac. Thomas J. Henry sold this penthouse in the\nAustonian\nto entrepreneur, author and dramatic producer Sir Mallory Factor and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Factor, in May, according to public records. The $8.3 million asking price amounts to about $1,600 per square foot for the 5,000-square-foot condo. Ramey had the listing.\n2701 Slow Turtle Cove | $8 million\nSteven Howse, who may be either the rapper or the creator of Slither.io, sold the 8,000-square-foot, five-bedroom, eight-bathroom Westlake Highlands home to Stewart Hudson in September, according to public records. Howse asked about $1,000 per square foot. Michael Lamendola of The Austin Home Company had the listing.\n2001 Cueva De Oro Cove | $8 million\nVenture capitalist Joe Aragona sold the 7,900-square-foot, five-bedroom, seven-bathroom home at 2001 Cueva de Oro Cove to Vijay and Rachana Iyengar in October, according to public records. The home turned around quickly after listing in September. The asking price equates to about $1,000 per square foot. Shiflet had the listing.\n3500 Ranch Road 620 Road North | $7.9 million\nDubbed \u201cThe Bond House\u201d for its mid-century sleekness, the 5,200-square-foot, four-bedroom, five-bathroom home was designed by renowned Texas architect O\u2019Neil Ford in 1962.\nIt was also the viral listing of \u201cSpy Kids\u201d director Robert Rodriguez\n, who originally listed it for $8.9 million in 2024. It sold when it was asking $7.9 million, or about $1,500 per square foot. The home is on a lot that spans almost 4 acres on Lake Travis.\nThe Ryan Chen and Chia Jung Living Trust purchased the property in March, according to public records.\n",

        "content": "Two attempts to put a lavish resort on the waterfront of a Riverhead hamlet went nowhere. Thanks to the state, there won\u2019t be a third try.\nNew York State finalized a nearly $11 million conservation easement at Broad Cove Preserve, permanently barring construction on land that preservationists long viewed as one of the East End\u2019s most vulnerable large parcels, Newsday\nreported\n. The 100-acre waterfront site in Aquebogue, once floated as the home of a 500-room resort, is officially off the development map.\nThe state Department of Environmental Conservation paid $10.95 million for the easement, which cements protections on the former duck farm overlooking Flanders Bay. The property is owned by Peconic Land Trust, which acquired the site in 2021 while developers were circling, including one proposing a large-scale resort complex.\nThat resort idea wasn\u2019t new: in 2016, a separate developer pitched a 500-room hotel and spa at Broad Cove before abandoning the plan. By the time the land trust moved to buy the property, the owner, Walo LLC, was still entertaining development offers.\nThe trust ultimately\npaid $11.5 million\nusing private donations and short-term credit, betting the state would later step in with permanent protection.\nThe easement, recorded with the deed, prohibits development in perpetuity, even if the land trust eventually sells the property. It also guarantees public access, locking in recreational use at a site spanning roughly 100 acres, including about 8,000 feet of shoreline along Terry Creek and Broad Cove.\nPreservation advocates framed the deal as a close call. Peconic Land Trust officials said development was an \u201cimminent threat\u201d when the group moved to acquire the land, which sits adjacent to Indian Island County Park and has been flagged in the state\u2019s Open Space Conservation Plan since the early 1990s.\n\u201cWhat was once slated for a major waterfront development project has now been preserved and transformed into a beautiful public recreational space in perpetuity,\u201d Riverhead Town Supervisor Tim Hubbard said in a statement.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "South Florida\u2019s top office deal this year was Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega\u2019s $274.4 million purchase of Brickell\u2019s Sabadell Financial Center.\nThe sellers received a higher offer from a buyer who required a loan, but they went with Ortega\u2019s all-cash offer, a source said. Cash deals are often preferred because they take out the uncertainty of closing that comes with financed purchases, experts said.\nDistress was still part of the story for the tri-county office market this year, as high interest rates and remote work trends linger.\nOf the 10 biggest office sales this year, one property traded out of bankruptcy, another out of foreclosure, a third through deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure, and two properties traded for minimal value gains from their previous prices.\nDowntown West Palm Beach, which billionaire Steve Ross is recreating in his own image, is the one submarket that showed immunity to the slowdown. His Related Ross is the biggest office landlord in downtown West Palm, where he has quickly tenanted his top tier buildings at record lease rates partly by tapping his New York connections.\nHere are South Florida\u2019s top office deals for 2025.\nAll-cash fashion\nSpain\u2019s richest person, Amancio Ortega, bought the 30-story Sabadell Financial Center in Brickell for\n$274.4 million\nin cash.\nOrtega\u2019s Pontegadea family office, which invests dividends from Ortega\u2019s retail empire in real estate, bought the 1 million-square-foot tower at 1111 Brickell Avenue in Miami in October. The deal broke down to roughly $274 per square foot.\nTenants include co-working firm Industrious, marketing firm Tibint, Kennedys Law, Law Offices of Wolf &amp; Pravato and commercial real estate services firm Northmarq.\nSellers New York-based KKR and Orlando-based Parkway had paid\n$248.5 million\nfor Sabadell Financial Center in 2018, marking that year\u2019s top office deal. The tower was completed in 2000 as part of a larger mixed-use project that included the adjacent 296-key JW Marriott Miami.\nOrtega\n, best known as the founder of Zara and Bershka, also owns Massimo Dutti, Stradivarius, and Pull and Bear through his Inditex holding company. His Sabadell purchase was part of Ortega\u2019s global real estate shopping spree this year, likely a way for the billionaire to quickly reinvest his hefty Inditex payouts to avoid Spain\u2019s high taxes.\nTrio buys Bank of America Plaza at Las Olas City Centre\nLone Star Funds, through its real estate fund VII, Highline Real Estate Capital and Square2 Capital bought the 23-story Bank of America Plaza at Las Olas City Centre in downtown Fort Lauderdale for\n$221 million\nin February.\nThe 410,600-square-foot building at 401 East Las Olas Boulevard traded for $538 per square foot. Completed in 2003 on a full city block, Bank of America Plaza has averaged 94 percent occupancy over the years.\nDallas-based private equity firm Lone Star Funds is led by CEO Donald Quintin, Miami-based Highline is led by David Moret, and Coconut Grove-based Square2 is led by principals Jay Caplin and Michael Manno.\nSeller Rreef Property Trust, the U.S. subsidiary of German asset manager DWS Group, paid\n$220 million\nfor the building in 2016. This year\u2019s sale was part of\nRreef\u2019s\nyearslong strategy to deweigh its portfolio from offices.\nFirms divesting from offices amid the nationwide leasing and lending slowdown are more likely to part with their South Florida properties, market experts say.\nBecause the tri-county region\u2019s market got a boost during a pandemic-era influx of companies and increases in rents, landlords can sell their South Florida buildings for at least breakeven values or small gains. Elsewhere in the U.S., they would likely sell at a loss, experts have said.\nDWS sold another downtown Fort Lauderdale office property in the same week as the Bank of America Plaza deal.\nChicago firm buys Las Olas City Centre\nDWS sold Las Olas City Centre I &amp; II for\n$208 million\nin February.\nChicago-based Bradford Allen Investment Advisors, led by Jeffrey Bernstein and Laurence Elbaum, bought the 470,800-square-foot complex with an 18-story building at 350 East Las Olas, a 15-story building at 450 East Las Olas, a 1,344-space garage and retail space. The deal broke down to $438 per square foot.\nThe buildings were 76 percent leased at the time of the deal.\nDWS bought Las Olas Centre in 2014 for $204 million, according to records.\nWynwood office gamble goes awry\nNew York-based R&amp;B Realty lost its Wynwood office buildings in bankruptcy court.\nSan Diego-based Cire Equity acquired the\n$89.6 million\ncredit bid in August for the 12-story Gateway at Wynwood, at 2916 North Miami Avenue, and an adjacent single-story bank building, at 2830 North Miami Avenue, from A10 Capital. The price for the 220,900-square-foot property breaks down to $408 a foot.\nCire is led by Joshua Volen and Trevor Smith.\nAfter A10 Capital won a final judgment in its foreclosure case against R&amp;B last year, R&amp;B affiliates filed for\nbankruptcy\n, avoiding foreclosure auction. A10 Capital later won the bankruptcy auction for the properties when no other bids were submitted, though R&amp;B was given a chance to refinance its $112.9 million loan on the building.\nAron Rosenberg\u2019s R&amp;B completed Gateway at Wynwood in 2021, just as the neighborhood gained an image as an office mecca amid the influx of out-of-state companies to South Florida.\nMarket boosters touted Wynwood\u2019s newfound reputation as a magnet for tech firms, with some even rechristening the area \u201cSilicon Valley South.\u201d Yet, Wynwood\u2019s fortunes\nturned\n, and data shows tech firms\ndidn\u2019t account for hefty office leasing\n. In the meantime, landlords got hit with higher interest rates.\nGateway at Wynwood took a financial hit when a cyber attack stole a $3 million-plus payment to the general contractor, R&amp;B said in court filings. Later, its construction loans matured just as aggressive interest rate increases started. It obtained two loans from A10, making partial payments. A10 then sought foreclosure.\nCoconut Grove buildings come full circle\nAzora Private Solutions, a global investment manager that\u2019s a joint venture between Miami-based Exan Capital and Madrid-based Advenir Azora, bought two office buildings in Miami\u2019s Coconut Grove for\n$82 million\n, combined.\nIn September, Azora paid $301 per square foot for the seven-story building at 3225 Aviation Avenue and the four-story building at 3250 Mary Street. Azora is led by Juan Jos\u00e9 Zaragoza and Ignacio Gil-Casares.\nThe deal was a buyback for Exan Capital. In 2020, Exan Capital, which was founded by Zaragoza, sold the properties to Washington, D.C.-based Madison Marquette for a combined\n$47.4 million\n.\nTourmaline buys distressed Coral Gables offices\nTourmaline Capital Partners bought Columbus Center in Coral Gables for\n$76 million\nin March, a year after the complex\u2019s debt woes began.\nBryn Mawr, Pennsylvania-based Tourmaline paid $290 per square foot for the 14-story building and eight-story building on a 2.5-acre site at 1 Alhambra Plaza. The complex spans nearly 262,000 square feet.\nThe previous owner, San Antonio, Texas-based Affinius Capital, defaulted on its $71.6 million loan last year, and it\nentered special servicing\n. Affinius had failed to renew an interest rate cap, or a hedge against increases of interest rates, for the floating-rate loan, according to Morningstar Credit. That constituted a default under the financing agreement with lender V\u00e4rde Partners.\nMinneapolis-based V\u00e4rde filed for foreclosure against Affinius last year, alleging it defaulted on a $68.9 million loan and a total amount due of\n$77.4 million\n, including interest and late fees, according to the complaint.\nChris Neilson, the court-appointed receiver overseeing Columbus Center and its financials in the foreclosure suit, sold the building to Tourmaline, writing in a court filing that the deal \u201crepresents a reasonable and fair market value.\u201d\nTourmaline, led by\nBrandon Huffman\n, bought the property free from liens or other financial obligations.\nRyder\u2019s HQ trades at a discount\nRyder System\u2019s Coral Gables headquarters traded this month for\n$70.4million\n, a 13 percent discount from its price over a decade ago.\nFort Worth, Texas-based Crescent Real Estate, led by John Goff and Conrad Suszynski, bought the 11-story, 205,400-square-foot Ryder Colonnade at 169 Coral Way for $331 a foot. Boston-based AEW Capital Management was the seller.\nThe building\u2019s name was changed to include \u201cRyder,\u201d after Miami-Dade County homegrown logistics giant\nRyder System\nmoved its headquarters there last year. Ryder was based previously in a northwest area of the county for roughly 20 years, and moved to a smaller space at Ryder Colonnade, citing the\nremote work shift\n.\nBoston-based TA Associates Realty, through an affiliate, paid\n$81 million\nfor the office building in 2013, records show. In 2015, AEW Capital took over the entity, meaning it likely purchased the entire ownership stake of the building, state corporate records show.\nHamilton\u2019s struggling suburban offices play\nNashville-based Hamilton Development bought three office buildings in Miami-Dade County\u2019s Flagler Station business campus, purchasing the seller\u2019s\n$64 million\nloan on the properties in May.\nSalt Lake City, Utah-based Bridge Investment Group sold the adjacent properties at 9675, 9725 and 10451 Northwest 117th Avenue in an unincorporated area of the county for $158 per square foot. After acquiring the Wells Fargo loan, Hamilton then took over the buildings through deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure.\nThe deed-in-lieu of foreclosure for the building at 9675 Northwest 117th Avenue was valued at\n$20.8 million\n, for the building at 9725 Northwest 117th Avenue was valued at\n$20.4 million\nand for the one for 10451 Northwest 117th Avenue at $21.1 million.\nBridge Investment paid a combined $85.8 million for the buildings in 2018, records show.\nHamilton was founded in 2023 by former executives at Irvine, California-based Panattoni Development. Hamilton is led by\u00a0 Whitfield and Hayne Hamilton.\nThe deal came amid struggles for South Florida\u2019s suburban offices, even as top tier buildings in prime markets such as downtown West Palm Beach and Miami\u2019s Brickell thrive with new-to-market tenant leases and record rents. Aging office campuses in suburban areas have felt the sting from remote work, making them prime targets for redevelopment.\nThe Flagler Station buildings, completed in 2006, 2007 and 2009, struggled with occupancy at the time of Hamilton\u2019s purchase. Two of the buildings had an occupancy in the 40 percent.\nHamilton plans to replace the properties at 9725 Northwest and 10451 Northwest 117th Avenue with a two-building, 300,000-plus-square-foot industrial facility.\nThe building at 9675 Northwest 117th Avenue will remain, recently scoring a\n42,000-square-foot\nlease by the University of Miami for its health care system\u2019s offices.\nSteve Ross can\u2019t stop his West Palm investing\nBillionaire Steve Ross \u2013\u2013 who has at least 11 properties in downtown West Palm, including purchased, developed, under construction and planned \u2013\u2013 added the One Clearlake building to his portfolio.\nLast month, Ross\u2019 West Palm-based Related Ross paid\n$55.4 million\nfor the 18-story, 221,700-square-foot building at 250 South Australian Avenue and adjacent four-story, 669-space garage. The deal broke down to about $250 per square foot.\nIt was the second time One Clearlake traded this year. Seller Bradford Allen bought it for\n$45 million\n, marking a nearly 26 percent discount from its sale price four years ago.\nThe deal gives Ross 7.6 contiguous acres facing Clear Lake. Completed in 1987, One Clearlake sits on 2.9 acres. Ross also owns the adjacent two-story, 70,100-square-foot\nWPTV studio and office building\nat 1100 Banyan Boulevard, completed in 2000 on 4.7 acres.\nRelated Ross hasn\u2019t shared redevelopment plans. Any potential replacement of the buildings would have to wait because the E.W. Scripps Company, WPTV\u2019s parent, leased back its building for a term of at least two and a half years.\nRoss ripple effect\nToronto-based family office Coco Group, led by Jenny Coco, bought the boutique 100-year-old Echo building at 205 Datura Street in downtown West Palm Beach for\n$45.7 million\nin May.\nBoca Raton-based Morning Calm Management, led by Mukang Cho, sold the four-story, 71,700-square-foot building and attached 10-story, 257-space garage for $637 a square foot. Morning Calm renovated Echo in 2021.\nTenants include Stone Point Capital, Alta Rock Partners, Frost Point Capital, Beacon Ridge Capital Management and Bold Ocean, according to its website. Asking lease rates are $68 a foot, triple net.\nWest Palm Beach emerged as one of South Florida\u2019s top office markets largely due to\nRoss\u2019 hefty investment and development activity\nin the area.\nRoss stepped back from New York-based Related Companies, which he founded over 50 years ago, to start and lead Related Ross last year. His buildings were among the first to reach a record lease rate of over $100 a foot, though asking rates have topped that in more recent years.\nSource(s): TRD analysis of deals reported by TRD, Colliers, Cushman &amp; Wakefield and Commercial Observer.\n",

        "content": "Rents in New York City are\nreaching never-before-seen levels\n\u2014 even for the city\u2019s wealthiest.\nAn apartment at the Benson,\nNaftali Group\u2019s 15-unit luxury condominium\non the Upper East Side, rented for $95,000, or $288 per foot, this week. For a 12-month term, the price per square foot appears to be one of the highest in the city\u2019s history.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s Lauren Muss, John Giannone and Jac Credaroli had the listing. Serhant\u2019s Peter Zaitzeff brought the tenant.\nSpanning almost 4,000 square feet, Unit 14 has five bedrooms, four full bathrooms and a great room with triple exposures overlooking Madison Avenue.\nThe anonymous owner of the unit at the Benson had bought the condo from the sponsor for $14.5 million in 2022. In 2023, they rented the same unit out for $65,000 per month, according to StreetEasy.\nThe Benson, at 1045 Madison Avenue, has amenities including a landscaped rooftop lounge, a cinema and a spa with sauna and steam rooms.\nIt\u2019s difficult to ascertain a true priciest rent per foot given the lack of public records around rentals, but several say it\u2019s one of the highest numbers they\u2019ve seen for a standard 12-month lease.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not the highest, it\u2019s one of the highest ever,\u201d said Miller Samuel CEO Jonathan Miller, an appraiser who releases a monthly report on the city\u2019s rental market.\nThe luxury rental market has outpaced\nManhattan\u2019s overall red-hot market, according to Miller. In November, Manhattan\u2019s median rent rose over 13 percent annually to a record $4,750, while luxury rents \u2014 defined as the top 10 percent of recorded rents in the month \u2014 rose almost 18 percent to a median price of $11,500.\nOne of the most expensive rentals on a per-square-foot basis in recent memory was Unit 57B at 220 Central Park South, which rented for $90,000 per month, or $336 per square foot, in 2023, according to StreetEasy.\nThe most expensive rent recorded on StreetEasy belongs to a set of units at Jeff Greene\u2019s condo conversion at\n100 Vandam Street\nthat went for $150,000, as well as the penthouse at 24 Leonard Street, which Zaitzeff also rented out for $150,000.\nFurnished residences that rent for a month at a time can rent for even more.\nWhile cracking six figures on rentals is still rare, Giannone, one of the listing agents on unit 14, said he\u2019s seeing a new threshold arising for the luxury market.\n\u201cI personally have never seen prices where they\u2019re at,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the high $100s per square foot for a rental starts to become like the norm, it\u2019s completely different from what we\u2019re used to.\u201d\nMuss said that they likely could have gotten even more for the unit, which was initially asking $85,000, but were given a single two-hour window to show it. Still, she said they had multiple bidders.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just no product, and there\u2019s a lot of money out there,\u201d she said.\nZaitzeff said his clients, who were renovating their townhouse and needed a place to stay, were willing to pay above the asking price to secure the deal.\n\u201cIt speaks to the lack of inventory and people willing to pay what it takes to get a deal done,\u201d he said.\n",

        "content": "Another piece of Chicago\u2019s early skyscraper history is receiving landmark status, clearing the way for a major residential conversion in the Loop by Igor Gabal and Envoi Partners.\nThe Chicago City Council approved the designation of the former Central YMCA Headquarters this week at 19 South LaSalle Street, a 132-year-old building designed by William Le Baron Jenney, widely credited as the father of the skyscraper, Urbanize Chicago\nreported\n. The vote formally protects the building\u2019s exterior just as local developer Envoi Partners moves forward with plans to redevelop the property into apartments and ground-floor retail.\nEnvoi acquired the 16-story building in October 2024 through a venture backed by Chicago\u00a0 Gabal that bought the troubled 159,000-square-foot building\u2019s loan note for $4.2 million.\nEnvoi Partners\n, led by Nate Ernst and Cory Faulkner, assumed an ownership stake alongside Gabal in the property, and has since secured permits to demolish the interior as part of a $64 million adaptive reuse project,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported.\nHartshorne Plunkard Architecture is designing the conversion, which will deliver 207 apartments on the upper floors and new retail at street level. Power Construction is slated to begin work in spring 2026.\nCity officials found the building met multiple criteria for landmark status, starting with its historical role as the headquarters of the Central YMCA during the organization\u2019s rapid expansion in Chicago in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Unlike most YMCA facilities of the era, the LaSalle Street property combined association programming with a high-rise commercial office component, packing nearly 40,000 square feet of rentable offices into the building to help offset costs in the central business district, according to the outlet.\nFrom the 1920s through the 1950s, the\nbuilding\nserved as the hub of the YMCA\u2019s educational programming, benefiting from its central location and ample classroom space.\nThe designation also rests on architecture. Completed in 1893 by\nJenney &amp; Mundie\nand expanded in 1913 by successor firm Jenney, Mundie &amp; Jensen, the structure is an early example of a fireproof, steel-frame skyscraper. Its design blends late-19th-century historicism with the emerging Chicago School emphasis on structural expression and restrained ornamentation. According to Urbanize, the west tower\u2019s Romanesque and later Classical Revival treatments contrast sharply with the stripped-down south elevation, reflecting Jenney\u2019s functional philosophy.\nThe building is one of only two remaining Jenney-designed structures in the Loop, alongside the New York Life Building across LaSalle Street. Though altered over time, including changes to storefronts and the removal of its cornice, the property retains much of its original massing, materials and window patterns.\n\u2014 Eric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Jeff Sutton is going for the jugular in his fight against his lender on a struggling Herald Square property.\nThe retail titan and head of Wharton Properties fired back against the German bank Helaba after the lender initiated a\nforeclosure\non his property at 27-29 West 34th Street earlier this year.\nSutton\u2019s lawyers, Darren and Terrence Oved of Oved &amp; Oved, are now seeking sanctions and attorney fees from the lender Landesbank Hessen-Th\u00fcringen, also known as Helaba, claiming the lender\u2019s move to pursue Sutton was a \u201ctransparent, orchestrated attempt to tarnish\u201d his reputation.\nHelaba initially provided a $50 million loan in 2018 for the three-story building.\nBut the lender filed a lawsuit in New York Supreme Court in September, alleging the building owner defaulted and failed to pay over $12 million in real estate taxes to New York City. Sutton was also named as a defendant in the lawsuit because he signed a limited guarantee.\nSince then, a New York State Supreme Court judge appointed a temporary receiver for the property.\nBut Sutton\u2019s lawyers have filed a motion to dismiss and are now leveling allegations against the lender itself. At the crux of Sutton\u2019s new legal filings is his limited personal guarantee, which would only make him liable in instances of fraud or other intentional misrepresentations.\nThe lender claimed Sutton\u2019s unpaid tax bill put him in default. But by Sutton\u2019s account, the property\u2019s value was decimated by Covid. The property\u2019s valuation, along with others on 34th Street, was slashed. Two of the property\u2019s prior tenants Geox and Aldo entered bankruptcy, further cutting into rental revenue.\nSutton\u2019s legal filings also take aim at the City\u2019s Department of Finance for assessing real estate taxes on the property as though it were bringing in $6.6 million in gross rental income. In actuality, he claims, the rent was about 10 percent of the city\u2019s total, at $680,000.\nThe property has not received rents anywhere close to the City\u2019s number over the last six years, according to Sutton\u2019s filings.\nSutton claims he eventually entered into an agreement with the city to reduce the amount of taxes owed by millions of dollars.\nAccording to Sutton, the borrower had an \u201cunbroken record of timely principal and interest payments.\u201d\nBut in April, the lender sent over a notice of default, citing the $12 million unpaid real estate taxes.\nSutton\u2019s filing claims the lender was repeatedly made aware of the outstanding tax liability. That liability was also listed on the Department of Finance\u2019s website for years.\nThe lender initiated an event of default anyway, according to Sutton, despite the fact that the tax issues were still being adjudicated with the city.\nBy September, the German lender initiated a foreclosure and named Sutton as a defendant over a limited personal guarantee he signed.\nSutton\u2019s lawyers at Oved &amp; Oved, who have notably gone up and won against sharp-elbowed lenders such as Maverick Real Estate Partners and\nRialto Capital\n, argue that Sutton\u2019s guarantee only applies if the borrower committed fraud or made intentional misrepresentations. They claim Sutton did neither. And all rents from the property have been turned over to the receiver.\n\u201cOur motion to fully dismiss plaintiff\u2019s baseless claims and for sanctions for its utter frivolousness puts plaintiff on notice that its misguided actions have caused our clients significant harm \u2014 harm we are determined to significantly remedy,\u201d said Terrence and Darren Oved.\nSutton initially acquired the buildings through a joint venture with SL Green in 2006. The $30 million deal included a third adjacent building.\nHelaba\u2019s attorney did not return a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "Manhattan\u2019s luxury market defied some doomsday predictions in 2025 to end with a strong showing.\nEarly in the year, high interest rates, fears over\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies\nand an\nimpending mayoral election\ndominated headlines. Despite reported concerns of a slowdown and deterrants for wealthy buyers, the borough still nabbed its second-biggest period for luxury contracts since 2006, when Olshan Realty began tracking data.\nBuyers inked deals for more than 1,400 homes asking $4 million or more this year, up 11 percent from 2024, according to the brokerage\u2019s annual report. The signed contracts totaled just under $12 billion, up from just $11.2 billion last year.\nOlshan Realty chalked the increase up to sellers finally reckoning with the realities of the market and lowering asking prices. The average asking price dropped 4 percent compared to last year. The report also pointed to a strong year for Wall Street as a bolster to the market.\nFor every one co-op to find a buyer, three condo contracts were signed, which has been the case for more than a decade. Half of the condos sold this year were new development apartments.\nMore than 280 homes asking $10 million or more entered contract \u2014 six more than last year, but significantly less than the 400 trophy deals inked in 2021, the highest year on record.\nPriciest deals inked last week\nThe short week leading up to Christmas was a quieter one. Buyers signed just 13 contracts for Manhattan homes asking $4 million or more, which was on par with the last time Christmas was on a Thursday but lower than the decade average of 17 for the week.\nThe total was also less than the 21 deals inked in the\nprevious period\n.\nThe priciest home to land a signed contract was a penthouse at 65 West 13th Street, with an asking price of $13.5 million. The pending deal includes two separate condos sold by different sellers, which could be combined to total roughly 5,400 square feet. The duo hit the market two years ago, asking just under $17 million.\nUnit 11A, which last traded for $6.4 million in 2011, has three bedrooms, three bathrooms and a terrace. It\u2019s unclear when and for what price Unit 11B last sold. The apartment features two bedrooms, two bathrooms and a wraparound terrace.\nAmenities in the 77-residence building, known as the Greenwich, include doormen, a gym and a children\u2019s playroom.\nNest Seekers\u2019 Tamir Shemesh and Patty Lehan had the listing.\nThe second most expensive property to find a buyer was a sponsor unit at CIM Group\u2019s 235 West 75th Street, known as the Astor. Unit 723, which spans 3,800 square feet, last asked just under $8 million. It has five bedrooms, five bathrooms and a library.\nCIM Group foreclosed on the project in 2021,\ntaking it over\nfrom Ziel Feldman\u2019s HFZ Capital, which had converted the pre-war rental building into condos in 2015. At the time, CIM also took control of three other properties that the now-defunct firm had planned to convert.\nAmenities at the building include 24-hour concierge services and a fitness room. Douglas Elliman\u2019s Kyle Egan, Katherine Gauthier and Will Rivera had the listing.\nOf the 13 properties, nine were condos, two were co-ops and two were townhouses.\nThe homes asked a combined $82 million, which works out to an average price of $6.3 million and a median of $5.6 million. The typical home was on the market for more than three years and had a discount of 7 percent.\n",

        "content": "Illinois homeowners insured by Allstate are bracing for another hit next year, as the state\u2019s second-largest provider moves forward with a round of rate increases.\nAllstate plans to raise homeowners insurance premiums in Illinois by an average of 8.8 percent beginning Feb. 24, 2026, according to a recent filing with the Illinois Department of Insurance. The increase will affect more than 209,000 policyholders statewide and comes on top of the\nNorthbrook\n-based insurer\u2019s increase of around 9 percent nearly a year ago, the Chicago Sun Times\nreported\n.\nUnder the new filing, individual\nincreases\nwill range from 4.9 percent to 10.4 percent, with the \u201ctypical\u201d homeowner seeing an 8.8 percent bump when their policy renews.\nIllinois\nlaw requires insurers to notify regulators of rate changes, but the state has limited authority to block or roll back increases, leaving consumers with little recourse.\n\u201cAllstate is the second-largest U.S. home insurer because we have accurate, competitive prices and are there for customers when they need us,\u201d the\ncompany\nsaid in a statement. \u201cIllinois rates are being driven by the state\u2019s severe weather events and higher repair costs.\u201d\nConsumer advocates aren\u2019t buying it. Abe Scarr, director of the Illinois Public Interest Research Group, called the increase excessive, telling the outlet that Allstate reported $3.7 billion in profit in the third quarter this year. He warned that Allstate\u2019s move could open the door for additional hikes from competitors.\nThe stakes are high for homeowners and the real estate market alike. Most mortgage lenders require insurance, and rising premiums can strain borrowers who are already stretched by higher interest rates, property taxes and maintenance costs. The outlet reported that in some cases, insurance costs can be the difference between a deal penciling out or not.\nAllstate\u2019s filing follows a much steeper move by State Farm, the nation\u2019s largest insurer, which implemented a 27 percent homeowners rate increase in Illinois over the summer, citing rising reconstruction costs after severe weather. That hike drew scrutiny from state officials. In November 2024, Illinois Department of Insurance Director Ann Gillespie demanded ZIP code-level policy data from State Farm, while Attorney General Kwame Raoul filed suit to compel the company to turn it over.\nThe pressure is building because homeowners were already reeling before the latest increases. A Consumer Federation of America study released in April found the typical Illinois homeowner paid about $1,000 more for coverage in 2024 than three years earlier \u2014 a roughly 50 percent jump, the second-highest increase in the country.\nEfforts to give regulators more power have stalled. A bill allowing Illinois to reject excessive rate hikes passed the state Senate last fall but died in the House.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The\nCity of San Jose\nhas given the green light to a mid-rise housing project on the city\u2019s western edge near Cupertino.\nBorello Asset Management has received the go-ahead to build a seven-story, 118-unit residential building on a 0.7-acre lot at 1000 South De Anza Boulevard, the Mercury News\nreported\n. The Morgan Hill-based firm will demolish an existing 2,658-square-foot commercial building to construct the new homes.\nBorello submitted its preliminary development application in June 2023. At the time, San Jose\u2019s housing element was not in compliance with state requirements, leaving an opportunity for the developer to take advantage of the builder\u2019s remedy process.\nUnder\nbuilder\u2019s remedy\n, any policies, ordinances, fees and standards in effect at the time of the application are locked into place. The city was also forced to evaluate the proposal as if it met land-use designation and zoning district requirements due to builder\u2019s remedy, though city project manager Alec Atienza said the project site was in a zoning district that would not allow housing unless it was 100 percent affordable or the applicant used another state law to proceed with development.\nBorello\u2019s plan calls for 44 studios, 42 one-bedroom apartments and 32 two-bedroom units. Of the 118 units, 24 will be available at 80 percent of the area\u2019s median income. In 2025, the area median income for one person in\nSanta Clara County\nis $136,650. Construction could begin early next year and take about 14 months to complete, according to an environmental impact report released earlier this year.\nThe project has faced pushback from neighbors living on nearby Ventana Place.\n\u201cIf the ground sinks or settles due to excessive vibrations or from the activity of lots of heavy equipment and machinery, the integrity of the post-tension slab at Ventana could be compromised, leading to potential catastrophic structural failures,\u201d Becky Bender, president of the Ventana Place Homeowners Association, said. \u201cThe ramifications would not only endanger the lives of Ventana Place residents, but also result in astronomical, multi-million-dollar repair costs that may not even fully restore the structure.\u201d\nErik Schoennauer, a land-use consultant representing the developer, tried to assuage those fears by noting that the environmental report included requirements to limit noise impacts and pointed out that construction vibrations wouldn\u2019t affect the nearby townhome buildings. He also addressed concerns that the seven-story building would stand out among shorter buildings along\nDe Anza Boulevard\n.\n\u201cThe city\u2019s plan is that a street like De Anza will be all seven stories some day,\u201d Schoennauer said. \u201cThat\u2019s the plan adopted by the City Council for decades, so our project, just because it\u2019s one of the earliest ones, is not out of place.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The seller was a joint venture between Metropolitan Life Insurance and New York Common Fund. The deal closed Dec. 17, and while the sale price was not disclosed, Crescent lined up $170.4 million in financing to acquire the property, deed records show.\nThe deal caps a banner year for Crescent, which also picked up the\n21-story Texas Capital Center\n. It bought the Uptown tower at 2000 McKinney Avenue from German investor Union Investment Real Estate in September.\nLed by chairman John Goff, Crescent oversees more than $10 billion in assets, according to the company. It\u2019s best known for The Crescent, the iconic mixed-use complex that anchors Uptown. The firm originally helped develop the project in the mid-1980s, later owned it in the 1990s, re-acquired it in 2009, sold it and then bought it back again in 2021 \u2014 the third time it\u2019s taken control of the trophy asset. The firm\u2019s local portfolio also includes the\nRitz-Carlton Dallas\nand Hotel Crescent Court, along with office properties at 2401 Cedar Springs and 2811 Maple Avenue.\nThe newly acquired building sits directly across the street from the Ritz-Carlton, with Klyde Warren Park just a short walk away, placing it squarely in the center of Uptown\u2019s office, hotel and luxury residential ecosystem. Developed by Trammell Crow Company in 1999 and designed by HOK, the brick building underwent a renovation in 2021.\nOne of the building\u2019s most visible tenants is CBRE, which maintains prominent signage atop the tower. The outlet reported that the brokerage recently completed an extensive overhaul of its roughly 95,000-square-foot, two-floor Dallas office inside the building, adding a steel staircase, coffee bar with a barista, concierge desk and even a hidden speakeasy. The space serves as CBRE\u2019s Dallas office, separate from its global headquarters at PwC Tower on Pearl Street.\nThe transaction is one of a number of\nblockbuster office deals in Uptown\nthis year, including the trade of\nThe Link at Uptown\n, which Atlanta-based Cousins Properties bought from Kaizen Development Partners over the summer.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The deal, disclosed in a bankruptcy court filing, is subject to being boxed out by better offers at the Jan. 8 auction.\nThe price point isn\u2019t locked in for Summit, either.

The auction plan came as a result of a bankruptcy case filed by the Wiener-connected parties in May; the bankrupt parties owe lender Flagstar more than $564 million.\nLawyers for the bankrupt entities blamed financial troubles on high interest rates, inflation in expenses, weak collections and tenant-friendly state legislation; the buildings generated more than $84 million in 2024.\nPinnacle fell behind on maintenance in the affected buildings.

Future development that could hinder the views is unlikely because of the Bonnet House Museum &amp; Gardens, a historic home and gardens, to the northeast of the development site.\nDesigned by Fort Lauderdale-based FSMY Architects, Sage will consist of two-, three- and four-bedroom condos, starting at 2,767 square feet, according to the release. The building will have more than 19,000 square feet of amenities, including Sage Wellness Spa.\nPMG has ramped up its luxury condo development activity in South Florida, and it\u2019s among the developers that have jumped on the branded residences trend. In downtown Miami, PMG and its partners are building the\nWaldorf Astoria-branded\nsupertall with 387 condos and 205 hotel keys.\nIn April, PMG scored a\n$413 million\nconstruction loan for One Twenty Brickell Residences with a 37-story, 266-unit condo tower and a 41-story, 537-unit apartment tower in Miami\u2019s Brickell. The project is under construction at 120 Southwest Eighth Street.\nDespite higher interest rates and a pipeline of towers threatening a potential over-saturation in the market, construction financing for luxury condos has flowed in South Florida.\u00a0Last month, Yamal Yidios\u2019 Ytech secured\n$565 million\nin financing for its 70-story, 195-unit condo tower at 1428 Brickell Avenue in Miami. Also, Edgardo Defortuna\u2019s Fortune International Group and Manuel Grosskopf\u2019s Ch\u00e2teau Group this month boosted an existing construction loan for their St. Regis Residences in Sunny Isles Beach to a total of\n$418.3 million\n. The two-tower project will have 320 condos at 18801 Collins Avenue.\n",

        "content": "A 50-acre island on the edge of San Francisco Bay is headed for a rebirth.\nThe uninhabited Point Buckler Island in the Suisun Bay estuary will be restored to its natural, marshy state after the nonprofit John Muir Land Trust\npurchased the property early this year\nfor $3.8 million, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n.\nPoint Buckler Island\u2019s restoration ends a more than decade-long saga over its future. In 2011, entrepreneur and former America\u2019s Cup sailor John Sweeney bought the island for $150,000 and began developing what he advertised as a luxury club for kiteboarders. While building a lounge and guest quarters, he allegedly illegally rebuilt levees and interrupted the island\u2019s tidal flows, according to regulators. Sweeney denied the allegations and said that he only made repairs to existing levees. \u201cMaybe 100 years ago it was a marsh, but in the last 75 years it was a duck club and dry land,\u201d he said.\nSolano County placed a lien on the property and ordered its auction in January after Sweeney\nlisted it for sale for $75 million\nin 2023. That year, a\nSupreme Court decision\ncreated jurisdictional uncertainty by dictating which waters are federally protected. That prompted a legal battle involving Sweeney that is still ongoing, as he\u2019s asking the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn the decision that he harmed sensitive habitat under the Clean Water Act and is hoping to have the land returned. Sweeney also faces millions of dollars of fines from the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Board and an unmet order to revive the island\u2019s natural flows.\nUltimately, the John Muir Land Trust submitted the nearly $4 million winning bid.\nThe environmental nonprofit\u2019s first move will be clearing the island of human-made debris, largely from the kitesurfing club, including two helicopter pads, a dock, trailers,\nshipping containers\nand fencing.\nOnce the site is cleaned up, the plan is to start restoring the island\u2019s tidal flows. The revival effort is estimated to cost a total of about $3.5 million and take three to five years to complete.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Brazilian developer Gilberto Bomeny wants to put the brakes on Cirrus Real Estate taking over his distressed downtown Miami redevelopment site, in a predicament playing out between Christmas and New Year\u2019s.\nBomeny entities that own the parcel at\n340 Biscayne Boulevard\n, home to a Holiday Inn built in 1950, asked a Miami federal bankruptcy judge last week to throw out Cirrus\u2019\n$77 million\ncredit-bid victory and order a new auction. In a Dec. 25 motion, the entities allege that \u201cconstant changes and irregularities\u201d in the sale process shut out rival bidders.\nBomeny\u2019s request sets up a showdown before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Laurel Isicoff at a hearing set for Wednesday, Dec. 31. Isicoff will either approve Cirrus\u2019 purchase or reopen bidding for the nearly\n1-acre site\n, which has city approvals for an 82-story, 950,000-square-foot tower with 374 condos, 120 hotel rooms, offices and retail, along with 500 parking spaces.\nAttorneys for Bomeny\u2019s entities and New York-based Cirrus, led by Joseph McDonnell, did not respond to requests for comment.\nBomeny\u2019s entities paid $65 million for the 10-story hotel with 200 rooms in 2015. The owner filed for Chapter 11 protection earlier this year to stave off a\nUCC foreclosure\nby a Cirrus affiliate that alleges Bomeny\u2019s entities defaulted on a $70 million loan. When U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Laurel Isicoff authorized the auction last month, she also approved a $101.5 million credit bid by the Cirrus affiliate, which is the largest creditor.\nCirrus won the Dec. 17 auction by submitting the highest offer at $77 million.\nAttorneys for the lender sought a court order five days later to force Bomeny to sign and finalize the purchase and sale agreement. But the Bomeny entities want the judge to disregard the auction results and reschedule the sale, according to Bomeny\u2019s motion.\nThe auction, conducted by Sotheby\u2019s Concierge Auctions, was initially set to begin at 6 p.m. on Dec. 17, the filing states. But two days before the sale, the auctioneer told Bomeny it would start at 4 p.m., the Bomeny entities allege. Then the evening before, Sotheby\u2019s allegedly pushed the time up again to 2 p.m.\nOn auction day, one of Bomeny\u2019s agents tried to log in at 2 p.m. but couldn\u2019t access the platform and was told by an online support chat that bidding would actually start at 6 p.m., even though the sale in fact ran from about 2:30 p.m. to 2:50 p.m., the motion alleges.\nCirrus\nwas the only bidder to participate in the online sale. Bomeny and his lawyers only learned of the repeated time changes because they \u201ccontacted the auctioneer directly and repeatedly,\u201d and that would-be buyers had no centralized way to track the shifting schedule, the motion states.\nAfter the auction closed, Bomeny learned that \u201cseveral\u201d prospective bidders who intended to participate were unable to do so because of the last-minute time change, a lack of communication from Sotheby\u2019s and technical issues that prevented registration or payment of the registration fee, the motion alleges.\nBrokers told Bomeny they represented clients who intended to bid and \u201cstill desire to submit offers privately or through an auction,\u201d according to the motion. At least one of the bidders was going to bid almost double the $77 million amount by Cirrus, the motion alleges.\nIf the judge approves Cirrus as the winner, no other creditors would receive any proceeds from the sale of 340 Biscayne, the motion states. The Bomeny entities are requesting a new auction date for Feb. 9.",

Three years ago, the two\npurchased\nan AMC theater in Santa Monica at 1310 3rd Street Promenade.\nThird Street Promenade has seen better days. Since the pandemic, shops, bars and restaurants have less foot traffic and more empty storefronts. The city council recently approved a proposal to let people buy alcohol from businesses and drink in the open air, but the jury is still out on whether that\u2019ll revive downtown Santa Monica.\nPustilnikov, last year, said he was working with the lender on a\ndefault\ntied to a third property in the area, retail that covers 1241 to 1247 3rd Street Promenade. The lender indicated about $19 million was past due.\nAt the time, Pustilnikov said it was difficult to refinance in that interest rate environment, which hasn\u2019t changed much despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s few rate cuts.\nThe Santa Monica default has come as Pustilnikov has been busy adding new holdings elsewhere. He recently joined with Kaveh Bral and Josh Javaheri and purchased the PacMutual, three interconnected office buildings, for less than $50 million \u2014 a steep discount compared to the $200 million Ivanhoe Cambridge, now La\u202fCaisse, paid a decade ago. That\ndowntown buy\ncame after Pustilnikov\u2019s purchase of the Original Pantry, a shuttered diner once owned by the late Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan.",

        "content": "Central Health is putting its own spin on the\noffice conversion\namid a broader push for public sector entities to own real estate rather than lease.\nThe Travis County-funded hospital district purchased the Northview Business Center, a 260,000-square-foot office building on roughly 25 acres at 9001 North I-35, according to county property records. The Austin Business Journal\nreported\nthat the deal closed Dec. 9, with the seller listed as Chicago-based Northview Owner.\nThe purchase price was not disclosed in public records, but the Travis Central Appraisal District most recently valued the site at $18.6 million for tax purposes. Internal documents signal a much larger financial commitment. Agenda materials prepared for Central Health\u2019s Oct. 22 Budget and Finance Committee meeting show the district proposed issuing $93.5 million in debt to acquire the property.\nDiscussions about the acquisition were held in closed session, but the agenda documents describe the Northview property as a\n\u201cpriority need area\u201d\nand outline plans to transform the office building into adult and pediatric\nclinical offices\n, along with clinical support space. The move is intended to help Central Health transition services out of leased facilities, though the district has not specified which clinics would relocate, according to the publication.\nThe property is not entirely vacant. About 70,000 square feet is currently leased through 2029, according to the same documents. One of the existing tenants appears to be Workforce Solutions Capital Area, based on publicly available listings tied to the address.\nThe acquisition adds to a growing list of public-sector real estate deals reshaping Central Texas, as government entities increasingly opt to buy large office properties amid softer market conditions. Travis County recently approved the use of eminent domain to acquire an\nEast Austin landfill\nit is being sued over, while the city of Austin has been especially active.\nIn recent months, the city has purchased a former motorcycle dealership, paid $87 million for Tokyo Electron\u2019s former\nSoutheast Austin campus\n, spent $107.6 million on the One and Two Barton Skyway office buildings and shelled out $41.1 million for a 143-acre tract in East Austin. It also bought a 207,000-square-foot office building at 3300 North I-35 for $26.2 million.\nCity officials have framed those acquisitions as part of a long-term strategy to control costs by owning space instead of leasing, arguing that leasing can cost roughly twice as much over time.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "In the final days of the Adams administration, officials are dangling an alternative development site in front of the team jettisoned from building housing at the Elizabeth Street Garden.\nFirst Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro gave Pennrose, Riseboro and Habitat for Humanity New York City and Westchester an ultimatum last week: If they want to develop 22 Suffolk Street, they must drop their lawsuit against the city.\nThe city-owned site is being offered in exchange for the development team abandoning its legal fight over the Elizabeth Street Garden. The city tapped the developers in 2017 to build 123 units of senior housing at the garden site, a project known as Haven Green.\nFor years, the city fended off litigation over the site\u2019s future, and after a key legal victory in 2024, the Adams administration moved forward with plans to\nevict\nthe garden. But soon after Mastro joined the administration, City Hall reversed course.\nIn June, the administration\nannounced\nthat it would leave the garden intact and would instead move forward with housing projects on three other sites: 22 Suffolk Street, 156-166 Bowery Street and 100 Gold Street. Projects on those sites, which need to be rezoned, would net thousands of housing units, including hundreds more affordable units than planned for the garden site.\nAfter Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani made clear that he would\nevict\nthe garden once in office, the Adams administration designated the city-owned site as parkland. At the time, Mamani said that undoing the action would prove nearly impossible because it would require buy-in from the state legislature.\nHowever, the development team\nsued\nthe city in November, arguing that the administration couldn\u2019t unilaterally declare the site a city park. Such a land-use change would need to go through the city\u2019s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, or Ulurp, which is required to map land as a city park, according to the lawsuit.\nIn a letter sent to the development team on Friday, Mastro said the city will designate the companies as the developers of 200 affordable housing units at 22 Suffolk Street as long as they drop their lawsuit by Dec. 31.\nIf the team doesn\u2019t abandon its lawsuit, the city will find another development partner, the letter states.\nMessages to representatives and attorneys for the developers were not immediately returned. A City Hall spokesperson could not immediately provide an explanation as to why the development of the Suffolk site was not decided by a public bidding process.\n\u201cWe hope this group of developers accepts our offer, so together, we can deliver on the Adams administration\u2019s promise to provide a win-win solution for the Elizabeth Street Garden \u2013 preserving cherished community green space while also building far more affordable housing than the 123 units originally contemplated at the garden site alone,\u201d Mastro said in a statement.\nOn Monday, the administration also announced that it had reached a licensing agreement with the nonprofit Elizabeth Street Garden to continue operating the park through the next 10 years, with the option of two five-year extensions.\nThe nonprofit has also agreed to pay $100,000 it owes in back rent for the site, in 10 annual installments over the next decade (the first $10,000 payment is due this week).\nIt\u2019s not clear how the development team will proceed. In November, the developers agreed to\npause\ntheir lawsuit as they negotiated with the city over the Suffolk site. In a Dec. 19 letter, the administration authorized the development team to seek financing for the Suffolk site, but Mastro said the lawsuit \u201cmaterially undermines the City\u2019s ability to maintain the confirmations of support and approvals necessary to advance the Suffolk Street project.\u201d\nHe was referring to an agreement reached with Council member Chris Marte to ensure his support of rezoning the Suffolk Street site, as well as the other planned rezonings, in exchange for leaving Elizabeth Street Garden alone.\nMarte was the sole Manhattan Council member to vote against the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity and previously spoke out against the rezoning planned for 100 Gold Street. Mastro said the three substitute projects would be dead on arrival without Marte\u2019s support, though the passage of ballot measures that\nweaken\nthe City Council\u2019s tradition of member deference may have changed the power dynamics for these rezonings.\nThe Adams administration\u2019s reversal on the Elizabeth Street Garden project raised questions about the risk of partnering with the city on projects. It also traded a project that was closer to shovel-ready for three that need to go through the city\u2019s land-use review process and will be the responsibility of the next administration to push forward.\nThe project\u2019s trajectory also complicates Adams\u2019 housing legacy, which included several initiatives aimed at building more housing throughout the city. The decision to drop Haven Green drew sharp criticism from housing groups, elected officials and developers who saw it as a hypocritical acquiescence to wealthy and celebrity interests.\nProponents of the garden saw the deal with Marte as a vindication of their long-standing argument that the city could find other, better sites for housing while leaving the park alone.\n",

The homes that went pending last week totaled $54.4 million in asking dollar volume and averaged 118 days on the market.\nThe previous week\n, buyers signed 19 contracts totaling $305 million in asking dollar volume, led by a pending deal for a waterfront Coconut Grove estate asking $115 million.\nThe report tracks signed contracts for single-family homes and condos included on the Multiple Listing Service asking $4 million or more in Miami-Dade County. It identified 19 new listings, and a total of 1,315 active listings on the market.\nFive of the properties that went pending last week were single-family homes, and three were condos.

It was built that year on a quarter acre, and includes five bedrooms, six bathrooms, one half-bathroom\nLippey and MacLeod first listed it last year for $8.8 million, and Riley Smith and Brian Sehmann with Compass had the listing.\n",

The site, which stretches along Huron Street from Franklin Street to Orleans Street, is currently occupied by a parking lot \u2014 a fading but still familiar sight in one of downtown Chicago\u2019s most built-out neighborhoods, Urbanize Chicago\nreported\n.\nWith caisson and foundation permits already in hand, the final approval allows ZSD, described as a boutique real estate developer on its website, to build the project from top to bottom.\nZSD\n, led by\nZev Salomon\n, bought the parcel for $9 million in April, acquiring it from North Wells Capital, which paid nearly double that price in 2019 and had once pitched a 24-story office building for the site.\nConstruction is expected to kick off imminently, with completion targeted for 2027.\nThe building will occupy nearly the entire site, broken only by a narrow strip of green space along\nNorth Orleans Street\nand a small portion of the western edge carved off into a separate parcel. Urbanize reported that the massing is a clean rectangle, articulated with a mix of facade treatments intended to break down its scale. Plans call for black and dark gray standing-seam siding, random-pattern box rib metal panels and brick cladding at the first two floors, including at the main entry and along the ground-floor residential units.\nStreet-level tenants will be\u00a0 concentrated along Franklin and Huron. Two retail spaces will anchor the corner, while the residential entry sits just west of the storefronts. Inside, residents will access a lobby, management office, package and mail rooms and bike storage.\nThe western end of the ground floor is reserved for 11 duplex units, a design choice that brings a more townhouse-like feel to the block. Those units will feature recessed private terraces facing both the street and the alley, buffered from pedestrians by screening and planters rather than blank walls.\nThe 149 apartments skew toward smaller layouts, reflecting both\nRiver North\ndemand and current financing realities. The mix includes 48 studios and 78 one-bedrooms, alongside 12 two-bedrooms. The duplex inventory adds seven one-bedroom and four two-bedroom units.\nAmenities are stacked at the top of the building, where residents will have access to an indoor lounge, private gathering space, coworking area and fitness center. An outdoor roof deck rounds out the package with lounge seating, fire pits and grilling areas.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Avdoo is looking to capitalize on a rising corner of Lower Manhattan.\nShlomi Avdoo\u2019s firm paid $63 million for a 12,500-square-foot lot on the corner of King and Varick streets in the Hudson Square neighborhood. Valley National Bank financed the purchase with a $40 million loan.\nThe site has over 125,000 square feet of development rights. Avdoo plans to pursue additional floor area through air-rights deals and a transit-related bonus tied to infrastructure improvements.\nThe final shape of the project will depend on the additional development rights Avdoo secures, but the developer said he is targeting high-end residential spanning more than 200,000 square feet.\n\u201cThe neighborhood is changing so quickly, and there\u2019s really no supply,\u201d said Avdoo.\nHudson Square, a newly minted Lower Manhattan neighborhood that sits adjacent to Tribeca, Soho and the West Village, has emerged as an appealing area for developers looking to capitalize on the wealthy buyers\nflocking to downtown\nin recent years.\nAvdoo\u2019s site at 68 King Street falls just outside of the Greenwich Village Historic District, which has limited most residential development on the west side.\n\u201cWhen you look at people who want to live Downtown, who want to live in Soho, want to live in the West Village, they don\u2019t have many options,\u201d Avdoo said. Because of the limited development options in the area, Avdoo said securing the site was \u201cone of the most competitive processes\u201d he\u2019s seen.\nThe site is blocks away from where major corporations like\nGoogle and Disney\nhave set up shop in recent years, one of the biggest factors that has enticed not just developers, but restaurateurs and retailers to look at opening stores in the once-sleepy neighborhood.\nAvdoo\u2019s purchase also comes after nearly one year of sales at\n80 Clarkson\n, the ultra-luxury development from Atlas Capital Group and Zeckendorf Development that is also just a few blocks from 68 King.\nWhile the building has not yet publicly shared sales numbers, the 112-unit development has reportedly been a\nmagnet for wealthy buyers\ntrying to enter the Downtown market. Earlier this month, the building put multiple units into contract for\n$129 million\n, which would far surpass previous sales records Downtown if the deal closes at that price.\nFor Avdoo, the deal is the latest in a string of activity across Manhattan and Brooklyn. In February, the firm paid\n$52 million\nfor five buildings on the Upper East Side, its first project in the neighborhood.\nIt has also launched sales at its 21-unit development at\n110 Boerum Place\nin Cobble Hill and started closings at the\nBergen\n, a 105-unit project at 323 Bergen Street in Boerum Hill.\n",

        "content": "BlockGen founder and CEO Bill Roy sold his condo at Continuum in South Beach for $23.9 million last week, just four years after buying it for half that.\nRoy sold the combined units 2803 and 2804 at 100 South Pointe Drive in Miami Beach to MB Continuum Trust, managed by Patrick Conroy, according to property records. The price amounts to $5,004 per square foot.\nConroy is a managing director and chair of the securities and finance practice at NERA Economic Consulting in New York City. Roy\u2019s Miami-based BlockGen is a fintech startup focused on blockchain products for the mortgage industry. He previously founded the private equity division of JAM Partners, according to published reports.\nRoy bought the Continuum condo for\n$12.1 million\nin 2021, property records show.\nThe 4,800-square-foot unit includes three bedrooms, three bathrooms and one half-bathroom. It is in the Continuum\u2019s 42-story south tower, which Ian Bruce Eichner developed in 2002. He completed the 37-story north tower in 2008. Since then, it has attracted high-profile buyers from across industries. Last year, financier Jim Chanos, who famously shorted Enron, sold his unit for\n$17.8 million\n.\nThe beachfront complex totals 521 units and includes two pools, three tennis courts and an oceanfront restaurant.\nRoy listed his unit for $25.9 million in March and took it off the market in July. It closed off market.\nIt is the latest pricey condo sale in Miami-Dade County in recent months. Earlier this month, Fort Partners sold an oceanfront penthouse at its Seaway at the Surf Club in Surfside for\n$86 million\n, a record price for the county. Shortly after, Fort sold a pair of units to billionaire Pablo Legorreta for\na combined $68.7 million\n.On Fisher Island, Andrew Zaro of the Zaro\u2019s Bakery family in New York\npaid $35.2 million\nfor a penthouse at Palazzo Del Sol this month, making it the private island\u2019s most expensive condo sale this year.",

The records reportedly found dozens of instances in which inspectors flagged crews for allegedly cutting corners, including dumping ash on neighboring parcels, reusing contaminated soil and leaving debris buried on sites cleared for reconstruction.\nEnvironmental Chemical Corporation denied authorizing such practices.\n\u201cAt a high level, ECC does not authorize the placement of wildfire debris or ash on neighboring properties, does not permit the use of contaminated material as fill, and operates under continuous [Army Corps] oversight,\u201d Glenn Sweatt, the Burlingame-based company\u2019s vice president of contracts and compliance, told the Times.\nOverall, FEMA and the Army Corps allocated $60 million to hire personnel to monitor daily cleanup operations and document any health and safety risks observed in the Eaton and Palisades burn zones between February and May.\nOne report cited an April incident in the\nPacific Palisades\nwhere inspectors said workers ordered by an Environmental Chemical Corporation official moved several buckets of fire debris onto an adjacent property after a cleanup truck had already departed. Other reports described crews using ash-contaminated soil to fill holes on fire-damaged properties, which would be a direct violation of state policy prohibiting contaminated material from being reused on site. Inspectors also cited workers for recontaminating cleared lots by walking through them with dirty boot covers, spraying polluted pool water onto neighboring properties and into storm drains and mixing clean and toxic soil with improper excavation equipment.\nThe Army Corps responded to nearly 1,100 public complaints related to the\nfederal fire cleanup\nbetween February and September. More than 20 percent of those were related to quality of work, with some of them aligning with the same issues inspectors pointed out, according to the Army Corps.\nU.S. Rep. Brad Sherman, who represents Los Angeles, wants authorities to investigate further.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to press the Army Corps to look at where the testing indicates there [were] still contaminants and who is the contractor for that, to see whether there are certain contractors that had a high failure rate,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cI want to make sure they\u2019re\u2026 evaluating these contractors vis-\u00e0-vis the next disaster.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Lift Partners is buying back an industrial building in the Peninsula after four years under different ownership.\nThe San Francisco-based firm acquired 100 Utah Avenue in South San Francisco in a sale-leaseback deal for $31.8 million, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nThe seller of the 4.4-acre property was Goodwill San Francisco Bay, which anchors the site and holds a short-term lease there. Lift owned the 120,000-square-foot building from 2018 to 2021 before selling it to\nGoodwill\n.\nLift Partners\u2019 purchase of the property comes after the company closed its fourth discretionary fund, which provided Lift with about $500 million in new capital to deploy for acquisitions such as these. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on hyper-infill opportunities along the West Coast \u2014 Southern California and the Bay Area right now,\u201d Patrick Fisher, a managing partner at Lift, told the Business Times, noting the influx of \u201ca diverse mix of tenants.\u201d\nLift has made a play in the Peninsula in the past. In 2022, the real estate firm paid approximately $10.8 million for a vacant 39,560-square-foot industrial building at\n3575 Haven Avenue in Menlo Park\n. It bought that property using its third discretionary fund, valued at $205 million. The company also owns the 21,906-square-foot 2500 Old Middlefield Way building in Mountain View, which it acquired in 2018.\nThe Peninsula industrial property market has been attracting large investors as logistics space becomes an increasingly hot commodity in the Bay Area. Last month,\nPrologis\n\u2014 the world\u2019s largest industrial real estate company \u2014 spent $314.5 million for an 11-building portfolio in\nCrocker Industrial Park in Brisbane\n, the neighboring city north of South San Francisco. That transaction marked the largest industrial property deal in the Bay Area this year.\nAs of the end of the third quarter, the Peninsula had about 800,000 square feet of active industrial tenant demand, according to CBRE data cited by the Business Journal. Industrial availability was approximately 7 percent and vacancy was about 5.5 percent, which are notably low figures when compared to the rest of the region, per CBRE. At the same time, industrial supply in the Peninsula has continued to shrink.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A champion of\ndowntown Dallas\nis walking away from one of the urban core\u2019s most ambitious redevelopment projects.\nDeveloper Shawn Todd\u2019s firm, Todd Interests is selling its ownership stake in the East Quarter district to partner J.P. Morgan Asset Management, effectively exiting the 20-acre project they launched in 2018. Dallas Morning News got\nconfirmation\nof the deal from Todd, who told the outlet that it is expected to close imminently. Financial terms were not disclosed.\nThe move hands full control of the growing district on the eastern edge of downtown to the global asset manager and marks the end of a partnership that began in 2018. East Quarter was developed by Todd alongside his sons, Philip Todd, the firm\u2019s CEO, and Patrick Todd, a partner at the company.\nOver several years,\nTodd Interests\nassembled more than 30 properties across eight city blocks, stitching together a mix of 1920s and 1930s-era buildings along Cesar Chavez Boulevard, Commerce Street and Jackson Street. The firm repositioned the former industrial and warehouse stock into offices, restaurants and creative space, aiming to bridge downtown\u2019s core with Deep Ellum\u2019s nightlife and residential growth. It also built the 20-story office tower at 300 South Pearl Street.\nThe redevelopment of the East Quarter benefited from the nearby revamp of the Dallas Farmers Market, in which a coalition of investors turned four neglected sheds sitting on 17 underused acres into an open-air pavilion, a food hall, retail and multifamily.\nHow much J.P. Morgan is paying for Todd\u2019s stake remains unclear, but the district is no small asset. Tax records and estimates from Partners Real Estate senior vice president Steve Triolet indicate the district could be worth anywhere from $200 million to more than $300 million, depending on assumptions around income and future development.\nThe buyout comes as J.P. Morgan wraps up its involvement in another high-profile Dallas investment. It acquired a 60 percent stake in\nNorthPark Center\nin 2014 for $362 million. That partnership ended earlier this year, when J.P. Morgan was bought out of its interest in the luxury shopping center.\nThe exit comes after a string of major, capital-intensive downtown projects for Todd Interests. The firm led the roughly $300 million renovation of\nEnergy Plaza\n, rebranding the 49-story, I.M. Pei\u2013designed tower as The Sinclair and converting it into a mix of residential and office space. Todd and partners also spearheaded the $460 million redevelopment of the First National Bank tower, transforming the historic skyscraper into apartments, offices, retail and a luxury hotel.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "What do luggage carts have to do with real estate? Glad you asked.\nIf you can understand politics and economics, you can understand much of what happens in the world. A common sentiment in New York politics is that people should get things for less than they cost, or even free. This explains rent stabilization, at least\nsince 2019\n.\nBut today\u2019s example is the humble airport luggage cart.\nTim Wu, the semi-famous Columbia professor (of law, not economics),\ntweeted\nthat a $6 fee for carts at Kennedy Airport \u201cjust feels extractive\u201d to a family with a lot of luggage.\n\u201cNothing says \u2018welcome to the land of the price gouge\u2019 like the JFK $6 fee for the luggage carts that are free in the rest of the civilized world,\u201d he wrote.\nFirst of all, America is not \u201cthe land of the price gouge.\u201d Lots of things \u2014 gas, gadgets, groceries, blue jeans \u2014 are\ncheaper here\nthan in other developed countries.\nSecond, the $6 fee for luggage carts makes perfect sense. It ensures that people who truly value carts will be able to get them and are the only ones paying for them.\nA basic rule of economics is that the less something costs, the more it will be used. If carts were free or underpriced, more travelers would grab one. That would lead to a shortage, as it has for rent-stabilized apartments.\nA cart shortage would be a problem for people who overpacked or failed to buy luggage with wheels. They would rather pay $6 than struggle to find a cart.\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airports, might respond to a shortage by adding carts. This would result in induced demand, just like widening a highway draws more vehicles to it. You end up with more congestion, be it vehicles on the interstate or luggage carts at baggage claim.\nThe extra carts would also add cost. Lots of \u201cfree\u201d luggage carts would not really be free.\nJay Martin of the New York Apartment Association likes to say, \u201cSomeone has to pay for the housing.\u201d The same is true for luggage carts.\nThe Port Authority, like landlords, is self-funded, not subsidized. If it bought more carts, or paid a vendor to supply \u201cfree\u201d carts, it would pass the cost on to all airport travelers \u2014 even those who don\u2019t use carts \u2014 in the form of ticket fees.\nBesides, a $6 fee for a useful item isn\u2019t \u201cextractive.\u201d What is? Forcing travelers to pay for carts that they don\u2019t use.\nIf the government subsidizes something for a select group of people, that thing should benefit society on the whole. Affordable housing does. Luggage carts, not so much.\n",

        "content": "A Hill Country town has moseyed into a race\ntypically dominated by fast-paced Dallas\n.\nFor the first time all year, a home in Fredericksburg has landed on the top 10 list of the most expensive new residential listings in the state, according to the Houston Association of Realtors.\nRetired banker Don Hanna and philanthropist Gwen Hanna are asking $7.5 million for their 10-acre property 6,200-square-foot home at 371 Achtzehn Road in Fredericksburg, about $1,200 per square foot. Built in 2022, the five-bedroom, six-bathroom home evokes traditional Hill Country architecture, making use of local limestone for most of the home and reclaimed barn wood for the den. The 10-acre property is down the road from Boot Ranch country club and about 6 miles north of downtown Fredericksburg.\nFredericksburg, a town about 80 miles west of Austin, is a\npopular destination spot for family tourism\n, thanks to the region\u2019s quaint architecture, scenic views, thriving\nwine industry\nand country music history. Listing agent Susan Barringer with Austin-based Kuper Sotheby\u2019s International Realty noted the property\u2019s potential as a luxury rental.\nThe most expensive luxury sales this year to date have taken place in\nDallas\n, which usually takes the top spot in HAR\u2019s monthly ranking. The priciest new listing of the month has been in Dallas seven times this year, and\nthe most expensive listing in the state\n\u2014 a 15.7-acre estate in Preston Hollow asking $64 million \u2014 is in Dallas. Houston follows close behind with a $60 million listing. Almost all lower-ranking listings are situated on the perimeter of the Texas Triangle, bound by Interstates 35, 10 and 45.\nWhile Fredericksburg rarely competes with Texas\u2019 big cities in residential luxury, it fields some heavy-hitting contenders in the ranch market. Nearby ranches for sale include the\nJL Bar Ranch, Resort &amp; Spa\n, a 4,600-property which draws between 7,000 and 10,000 guests a year, and the\n3 Creeks Ranch\n, a recreational 886-acre property asking $42.5 million.\nFredericksburg\u2019s Main Street, the town\u2019s primary tourist shopping hub, has attracted significant investment from\nDC Partners\n, which plans to develop a 22-acre mixed-use project by 2027.\n",

He\u2019s ending the year with plans in place for Manhattan\u2019s next big conversion.\nOfer\u2019s Quantum Pacific Group and Nathan Berman\u2019s Metro Loft Management filed plans for a 614-unit office-to-residential conversion at 101 Greenwich Street, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The partners bought the 26-story property from BentallGreenOak in February for\nmore than $100 million\n.\nQuantum Pacific could not be reached for comment by the publication, while Metro Loft did not respond to a request for comment.\nQuantum Pacific and Metro Loft already work together elsewhere. Last November, Ofer partnered with Berman\non an $88 million purchase\nof 767 Third Avenue, representing Ofer\u2019s first investment in U.S. commercial real estate. The purchase closed with a $55 million loan from Bank Hapoalim, charting a course for a conversion.\nThe conversion filing for 101 Greenwich was first reported by\nPincusCo\n.\nBGO acquired the building with Cove Property Group and Multi-Employer Property Trust from Kushner Companies and CIM Group in 2016\nfor $225 million\n. Shortly thereafter, ownership embarked on a $70 million renovation.\nTenants at the 400,000-square-foot building have included Independence Point Advisors, Moment Technology and Pro Shop Holdings, according to\nCompStak\n. A few months ago, BGO\nsued\nflex workspace provider Convene, alleging it owes it $10.6 million after failing to make rent payments since February.\nIt\u2019s been a busy end of 2025 for Berman, one of the most prominent office-to-residential converters in New York City. Last week, Metro Loft and InterVest Capital Partners scored\n$779 million\nin financing for their conversion of 111 Wall Street in the Financial District, part of the largest office-to-residential financing package in city history.\nOther prominent FiDi conversion projects in the works include a Metro Loft development at 25 Water Street, as well as projects at 55 Broad Street and One Wall Street.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A handful of prominent players in South Florida\u2019s real estate world spent 2025 in courtrooms, tangled in legal skirmishes that pitted power brokers, luxury brands and even a presidential legacy project against a cast of scorned investors, ousted owners and activist plaintiffs.\nA developer fended off anonymous smear campaigns. A builder accused investors of a hostile takeover of a project. A disgraced lawyer accused his former employers, a Miami\u00a0 Beach real estate power couple, of turning him into a scapegoat in a public corruption probe. And one of Miami\u2019s most prominent residential brokers and his wife settled a wrongful death lawsuit by the family of a college student that his wife ran over.\nHere are the 10 juiciest South Florida lawsuits reported by\nThe Real Deal\nin 2025:\nTrump library land deal lands in court\nThe most high-profile legal fight over South Florida real estate involved a downtown Miami parking lot adjacent to the Freedom Tower linked to the 45th and 47th U.S. president, Donald Trump.\nLocal historian and activist Dr. Marvin Dunn sued Miami Dade College in November over its board of trustees handing over the 2.6-acre site \u2014 free of charge \u2014 for a potential Trump presidential library within a nearly $1 billion mixed-use project. Dunn accused the college\u2019s trustees of violating Florida\u2019s public records and public meetings laws by quietly approving the September transfer with vague notices and little discussion.\nMiami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Mavel Ruiz issued a temporary injunction and set an August 2026 trial. But this month, the college held a do-over vote at a packed public hearing that was broadly advertised. The board again unanimously backed the transfer to a state board controlled by Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida\u2019s four Cabinet members, all of whom have already committed to transferring the land to the nonprofit foundation raising money for the presidential library project.\nRuiz ruled the second vote cured the violations and lifted the injunction. Her decision allowed the parcel, which reportedly has a market value of $60 million-plus, to move one step closer into Trump-branded history.\nThe Centners\u2019 \u201cfall guy\u201d\nJanuary brought fresh legal trouble for David and Leila Centner, the politically connected private school operators and real estate investors. The Miami Beach couple, who own Centner Academy and have significant commercial real estate holdings in Miami, allegedly let their former lawyer and lobbyist William Riley Jr. \u201ctake the fall\u201d for bribery and money laundering charges that state prosecutors brought against him last year, a pending lawsuit alleges. The criminal charges against him were dropped.\nRiley is suing his former clients for damages over the loss of his reputation, his ability to practice law and the expenses he incurred while fighting the criminal charges since his arrest in 2023.\nRiley was accused of funnelling $245,000 in illegal campaign contributions from a Centner entity to a political committee controlled by then-Miami City Commissioner Alex Diaz de la Portilla, who was also arrested and charged with bribery and money laundering. The affidavit contains excerpts of sworn statements by the Centners distancing themselves from the donations and the entity. The case was dropped after prosecutors determined the contributions were, in fact, legal.\nRiley claims Leila Centner directed him to open the entity\u2019s bank account, use it to buy real estate and fund political action committees. He alleges he followed her \u201cspecific and detailed instructions\u201d on contributions.\u200b His lawsuit accuses the Centners of never making an effort to clear his name.\nDe la Vegas face wrongful death suit\nIn February, One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty president Daniel de la Vega and his wife, Veronica Bilbao de la Vega, were hit with a wrongful death lawsuit over a fatal crash that killed University of Miami student Daniel Bishop near Coral Gables Senior High School.\nBishop\u2019s estate, led by his parents, Susan and Jason Bishop, filed the complaint in Miami-Dade Circuit Court. The Bishops allege Bilbao de la Vega negligently turned her husband\u2019s Cadillac Escalade into a crosswalk and struck their son, who was riding an electric scooter. Bishop\u2019s family also accused Daniel de la Vega of negligent entrustment of the vehicle.\nBilbao de la Vega was charged with failure to use due care, a traffic violation, and a second degree misdemeanor of driving with an expired license, court filings show. She pleaded no contest to the charges, and she received probation in January. A Miami-Dade judge ordered her to pay the maximum fine of $1,000, plus court costs, and serve 500 hours of community service.\nThe family and the couple reached a private settlement, and the civil case was dismissed this month.\nMystery smear campaign targets Michael Stern\nAn unknown Internet hater is out to get Michael Stern. In April, Stern and his JDS Development Group sued a John Doe in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, alleging an anonymous rival orchestrated an online smear campaign accusing Stern of fraud.\nThe operator behind JDSpulse.com and affiliated social media accounts allegedly claimed Stern has a \u201cdocumented criminal history\u201d and that his business is \u201cplagued by unethical practices, financial misconduct, and fraudulent dealings.\u201d Stern flatly denied the allegations, and is suing for unspecified damages in his defamation complaint.\nThough the website has since gone dark, the suit says the posts triggered \u201cunpleasant conversations\u201d with investors and seeks to unmask the perpetrator to recover the damages. The complaint is pending.\nElliman clashes with Eichner\u2019s Continuum\nDouglas Elliman had a hard time breaking up with developer Ian Bruce Eichner\u2019s Continuum Company.\nIn January, the brokerage sued a Continuum affiliate that took over sales for a 32-story, 198-unit condominium Eichner is building in North Bay Village.\nThe lawsuit, filed in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, accused Continuum of poaching agents Ruben Alvarez and Karla De La Torre after the developer fired Elliman as the exclusive brokerage for the planned Continuum Club &amp; Residences.\nContinuum breached its contract with Elliman by hiring Alvarz and De La Torre without Elliman\u2019s consent, triggering a $200,000-per-breach clawback, the lawsuit alleged. The brokerage is seeking $400,000 in damages under a marketing agreement.\nElliman and Continuum reached a private settlement that still needs a judge\u2019s signoff, a recent court filing states.\nJustin \u200bRundle versus Canero Group\nA bitter partnership fallout led investor Justin Rundle, son of Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle, to fire off a legal torpedo against Canero Group principals Jose Canero Sr. and his son Jose Jr., nearly wrecking the growing development firm\u2019s project pipeline.\nRundle sued the Caneros and their firm in Miami-Dade Circuit Court in May, alleging his business partners engaged in a scheme in which they allegedly used project funds to pay their company\u2019s expenses without authorization from Rundle and other investors, while also unnecessarily delaying the projects.\nCanero Group began as a luxury home builder but expanded into multifamily and townhome development in recent years. Rundle began investing in 2023 and brought on other investors to fund six Canero Group projects, the complaint states. He sought damages in excess of $3 million.\nThe Caneros denied any wrongdoing and accused Rundle of violating Florida bar conflict of interest rules involving lawyers getting into business with clients. Rundle reached a settlement with the Caneros in October. He walked back his fraud allegations after an independent third-party accountant found no fraud or misappropriation of funds, according to a Rundle spokesperson.\nPrive Group flips the script\nUsually, investors are the ones lining up to accuse South Florida developers of bait-and-switch tactics. But a January lawsuit by Prive Group and CEO Javier Rabinovich aims to flip the antagonists in that familiar script.\nTheir lawsuit in Miami-Dade Circuit Court seeks $20 million in damages from six Peruvian investors and their firm YVY Project Management, claiming they attempted a hostile takeover of an Aventura condo site and a Fort Lauderdale apartment project after Prive secured zoning approvals.\nPrive, known for an Aventura office condo and the Uptown Biscayne mixed-use project, also slapped lis pendens on the two development sites to block any sale while the dispute plays out.\nHowever, the case was placed on inactive status in April, court records show.\nBrickell condo in legal seige\nFed-up owners of a condo complex at 1060 Brickell voted late last year to oust board president Jacob Kassel, spawning a legal tussle that\u2019s raged since January.\nFollowing a $21 million special assessment and the elimination of electronic voting, unit owner Kimberly Spahr and fellow residents sued in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, alleging the Kassel-led condo association improperly canceled the election on the pretext of too few candidates. The complaint alleges the board wrongly disqualified Spahr over a \u201cmonetary obligation\u201d rather than an unpaid assessment, contrary to state law.\nBacked financially and politically by roughly 180 owners, about a third of the two-tower development\u2019s ownership, the plaintiffs are asking a judge to restore the ballot box \u2014 and strip Kassel of power. The case is pending.\nSupermodel fights Fisher Island bigwigs\nSupermodel Karolina Kurkova and her husband, actor and broker Archie Drury, sued the Fisher Island Club in February, accusing it of illegal strong-arming and intimidation that forced them off one of the country\u2019s richest ZIP codes.\nThe complaint alleges the board has been operating under invalid bylaws. Two directors \u2014 Douglas Elliman chairman David Chene and fellow Elliman board member Mark Zeitchick \u2014 used their positions to steer lucrative work to their brokerage on Fisher Island\u2019s last big development site, the lawsuit claims. Kurkova and Drury, recently expelled from the club, allege the board smeared Drury, leveraged threats and bent governance rules to sideline the couple while positioning Elliman as the lead broker on remaining prime land.\nFisher Island Club dismissed the allegations as the gripes of \u201cdisgruntled former members.\u201d\nThe complaint is pending.\nPalm Beach Shores developers dragged over $4.9M\nThe courtroom battles for the developers of a troubled Palm Beach Shores project keep piling up. In January, investor Daniel Perla sued the team behind a planned three-building, 15-unit condominium complex in Palm Beach Circuit Court.\nPerla alleges developers Marc Shulman, Anthony Shafer and a web of entities stiffed him on $4.9 million in loans that were supposed to help fund the project\u2019s construction. The complaint states Perla extended two high-interest loans \u2014 a $2 million note at 15 percent in 2021 and another $2 million at 10 percent in 2022. The complaint is pending.\nAlden Global accused of a multi-million shortchange\nJoseph Miller, a longtime lieutenant to Alden Global Capital boss Randall Smith, accused his ex-employer in January of stiffing him out of millions of dollars.\nMiller sued Alden\u2019s real estate arm Twenty Lake Holdings and an affiliate of hotel developer Blue Suede Hospitality in Delaware court over what he calls a lowball buyout on a national portfolio of hotels and warehouses.\nMiller alleges he spent more than a decade growing the real estate business, earning a 10 percent stake in Twenty Lake and a 3 percent stake in two Blue Suede hotels in Miami Beach and Charlottesville. After he split with Smith and Alden Global, Miller was offered $3.5 million for his equity and $2 million for his hotel interests, which Miller alleged is \u201cnot remotely credible or appropriate.\u201d\nThe complaint pegs the book value of his Twenty Lake stake at more than $15 million based on an August valuation of 88 properties. Miller also said third-party appraisals could push his entitlement north of $26 million, setting up a high-stakes valuation fight.\n\u200b",

The\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\nfactors in only homes listed in the Multiple Listing Service with an asking price of at least $4 million.\nThe resort-inspired estate at 145 North Mapleton Drive, which is listed by Compass\u2019\nGinger Glass\n, is asking $48 million. That pencils out to $3,127 per square foot.\nThe over 15,000-square-foot property sits on nearly a 1-acre lot and last traded in 2020 for $36.5 million, or $2,378 per square foot. That was when a limited liability company called Maple Living purchased the home, striking a deal on a property that first hit the market for $55 million in 2019, according to property records and listing sites.\nMaple Living is managed by Tri Star Sports &amp; Entertainment, according to records obtained through PropertyShark. The West Hollywood firm represents actors, athletes, artists and other high-net-worth clients and has reportedly been linked to stars such as Britney Spears and Kim Kardashian in the past. Earlier this year, the company acquired Miami business management firm LRW Group for an undisclosed sum.\nThe Mapleton Drive home is big on privacy with the property behind 12-foot-tall gates and a guard house with its own kitchen and bathroom. In all, the home counts seven bedrooms and 14 bathrooms with a chef\u2019s kitchen, bar, pool cabanas and home theater.\nAmong last week\u2019s signed contracts was a Malibu home that claimed the No. 1 spot in the Eklund Gomes report, with a listing price of $7.5 million, or $2,707 per square foot.\nThe 1978-built beach house at 6649 Zumirez Drive, with its own private access to Little Dume, is owned by a trust tied to producers Paul Taublieb and Susan Cooper.\nThe Emmy Award winners paid $740,000 for the home in 1996. The duo is behind the documentary \u201cUnchained: The Untold Story of Freestyle Motocross\u201d and \u201cThe Vow,\u201d a movie starring Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams.\nColdwell Banker Realty\u2019s Susan Monus holds the listing.\nTaublieb and Cooper initially asked just under $8 million for the home in September, before reducing the price to $7.5 million in November.\nThe home sits on an over 1-acre lot and counts three beds and three baths across 2,752 square feet.\nOverall, Los Angeles County saw five residential properties added to the for-sale inventory in the week, according to the\nEklund Gomes report\n. Meanwhile, a dozen homes went into contract, which was good for $66.5 million in asking volume. That\u2019s a spike of well over 200 percent compared to the same time last year.\n",

        "content": "Whether Chicago\u2019s real estate dealmakers got the rebound they wanted in 2025 depends on who you ask.\nLuxury residential brokers would say it was one of the\nbest years of their careers\n, and the city\u2019s\nbiggest brokerage\nwas officially absorbed by an even bigger one from New York.\nYet commercial developers and office landlords are still mostly on the sidelines, with only a\nselect few\ngetting back into the game.\nTrophy office towers are roaring again,\nmegaprojects stirred back to life\nand the Midwest\u2019s multifamily landlords are riding some of the\nstrongest rent growth in the nation\n\u2014 a result of dropoffs in new construction that nonetheless helped stave off lenders.\nStill, plenty of players, tenants and banks were\nrattled by distress\n, and lawsuits containing allegations of foul play and fraud flew back and forth.\nThese were Chicago\u2019s juiciest real estate stories of 2025.\nOffice market shows signs of life\nAfter years of headlines about distress and record vacancies, Chicago\u2019s office sector gained real momentum in 2025 \u2014 though only at the top end.\nThe biggest splash came at\nSalesforce Tower\n, where developers Hines and Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises landed a $610 million refinancing. That deal preceded a string of subleases, including space Salesforce rented to\nNewmark\nand private equity firm Wind Point Partners, showing trophy space still draws demand from top-tier tenants.\nThe Bank of America tower at\n110 North Wacker Drive\nsecured a $700 million refinancing led by landlord Oak Hill Advisors, marking the city\u2019s largest commercial mortgage-backed securities office loan since the pandemic. With Bank of America the largest tenant in the building and the tower offering high-end amenities, lenders showed a level of confidence that has grown rare for Chicago office buildings.\nIn Fulton Market, developers Jeff Shapack, Tim Anderson and their partner Walton Street Capital also defied Chicago\u2019s office market woes with a\n$247 million refinancing for 167 North Green Street\n.\nBut the picture wasn\u2019t uniform. Blackstone extended the\n$1.3 billion loan on Willis Tower\nfor a sixth time, as valuation swings and tenant downsizing kept pressure on the skyscraper.\nPlans for office\nconversions into residential chugged along\n. And trades within the sector that did occur extended the streak of extreme losses in value from previous sale prices.\nNew York-based investors were the big buyers:\n601W Cos. bought the building at 525 West Van Buren Street\nfor just $35 million, Mike Kohan paid just $45 million for the skyscraper at 311 South Wacker Drive to mark an 85 percent discount from its last sale, while Namdar Realty Group and Mason Asset Management are working on a deal to snag the tower at 190 South LaSalle Street at a steep loss for the seller,\nBeacon Capital Partners\n. Plus, the New York-based\nStahl Organization\npartnered with Hines to buy the Boeing Building for just $22 million.\nMeanwhile, Neil Bluhm\u2019s aforementioned\nWalton Street Capital is having a tough time\nselling its Magnificent Mile office tower at 401 North Michigan Avenue after drawing initial interest from seriously capitalized buyers.\nMegadevelopment momentum\nChicago\u2019s major development sites, some long-stalled, made real progress in 2025.\nAt\nLincoln Yards\n, new investors emerged to buy undeveloped land off the clearance rack, including\nJDL and Kayne Anderson\n. They paid\n$84 million\nfor land on the north side of the Chicago River from Bank OZK, which seized the property from a venture of the original developer, Sterling Bay and its partner Lone Star Funds.\nMore recently,\nJohn Novak\nemerged as a buyer for much of the southern Lincoln Yards assemblage. The revived momentum pointed to a more phased, modular approach, replacing the bigger, $6 billion buildout originally pitched by\nSterling Bay\n.\nDespite\nsuffering some setbacks\n, Bally\u2019s pushed ahead on its\n$1.7 billion permanent casino\ncomplex in River West. Construction rose on the riverfront site, and remained on track for opening in late 2026.\nRelated Midwest and CRG bought the long-dormant\nformer U.S. Steel site on the South Side\nin partnership with\nBlue Owl\n, teeing up a multibillion-dollar quantum computing project on the lakefront as the anchor of a larger redevelopment play.\nAnd at The 78 megasite, Related and billionaire\nJoe Mansueto\u2019s Chicago Fire FC\nsecured approval to build a privately funded soccer stadium \u2014 the site\u2019s first real vertical development.\nMeanwhile, stadium plans for the\nWhite Sox\nand\nBears\nremained uncertain. The Sox were left out of stadium planning at The 78, and the Bears floated a\nmove to Indiana\nafter Illinois lawmakers ignored funding requests.\n@properties sale to Compass kicks off new consolidation wave\nChicago\u2019s\nbrokerage landscape shifted\nwhen Compass acquired @properties Christie\u2019s International Real Estate in a $444 million deal that closed early in the year.\nThe move gave Compass a dominant foothold in the city and combined its marketing platform with @properties\u2019 agent base and mortgage and title arms. It also set off a wave of local reactions, as competitors\nrecalibrated, and agents speculated\nabout the merger\u2019s effect on the city\u2019s top firm.\nLocal legacy powerhouse\nBaird &amp; Warner bought\nthe Chicago-focused brokerage Dream Town Real Estate to bolster its scale.\nBut by year-end,\nCompass had agreed to a $1.6 billion all-stock acquisition\nof Anywhere Real Estate, which owns Coldwell Banker and Century 21 among other brokerage brands. If approved, the merger would give\nCompass a sprawling umbrella\nand further consolidate power at the national level, as brokerage industry norms get\nscrutinized and reconsidered\n.\nSouth Side multifamily distress\nWhile rents climbed and inventory stayed tight across Class A apartments, the South Side\u2019s multifamily sector struggled with legal, financial and reputational blows.\nIn South Shore, properties owned by\nWisconsin-based investor Trinity Flood\nwere\nraided by federal immigration agents\nfollowing a wave of tenant complaints and building code issues. The ownership group had already\nfaced foreclosures and lawsuits\ndue to subpar property conditions and loan payment defaults before the stunning law enforcement operation carried out in the middle of the night.\nNearby, legal fights broke out between\nonce-active investors\n. Chikoo Patel, who oversaw a portfolio of dozens of buildings across the South Side, was\nsued by multiple partners\n, including investor Shai Wolkowicki, who claimed Patel improperly siphoned off millions of dollars for his own use. Wolkowicki and Patel also\nfaced a foreclosure lawsuit\nfrom lender Old National Bank. Separately,\nWolkowicki also sued Mitch Goltz\nover claims of mismanagement in their prolific former retail development partnership,\nGW Properties\n.\nBack on the South Side,\nNew York-based Emerald Empire\u2019s apartment portfolio\n, which included over\n$600 million in real estate it purchased in bulk from Pangea Properties\nin 2022, slid into forbearance on a massive Fannie Mae loan.\nAcross Chicagoland,\nThe Real Deal also tracked the nearly $100 million\nthat investors who got blacklisted by Fannie Mae tossed into regional real estate.\nLakefront luxury reaches new peaks\nHigh-end housing\nsurged past previous records\nin 2025, especially along the North Shore and into Wisconsin\u2019s Lake Geneva.\nA\nWinnetka lakefront estate\nowned by Walton Street Capital executive Jeff Quicksilver and his wife Ashley Quicksilver sold for $32.5 million \u2014 the most ever paid for a home in Illinois \u2014 just weeks after another mansion in the same wealthy power town traded for\n$31 million\n.\nThe\nQuicksilvers set another local record\nas they downsized to a\n$14.5 million Kenilworth mansion\n, and a\n$20 million Lake Geneva sale\nalso closed, reinforcing a strong year for waterfront trophy homes. North Shore specialist\nJena Radnay\nclosed both the big Winnetka deals as well as the Kenilworth sale, marking a new peak for her brokerage practice.\nBut it wasn\u2019t all good news for Lake Michigan\u2019s shoreline homeowners. The residents who\nsued the Winnetka government\nfor overhauling rules to make it harder to develop blufftop land along the water\nsuffered a setback in court\n. Yet they\u2019re still fighting to repeal the regulations.\nLake Geneva also saw litigation. The\nhistoric Aloha Lodge\nbecame the\nsubject of a lawsuit\nafter an initial buyer walked away from a $37.5 million contract. But demand overall stayed strong, with multiple bidders vying for move-in-ready estates at about the\n$10 million range\n. Interest rate pressure didn\u2019t seem to reach this end of the market.\nProperty tax troubles plague all of Cook County\nIt\u2019s a perennial theme in Chicago real estate:\nproperty tax chaos\n.\nDelayed bills\nleft buyers in limbo\nand cost\nChicago Public Schools nearly $250,000 a day\nin interest on short-term loans it took on to cover the gap from late property tax revenue. Assessments across the\nSouth and West Sides jumped\n, with some homeowners discovering tax bills that had doubled.\nLate in the year, a federal court ruled the\ncounty\u2019s annual delinquent tax sale system unconstitutional\n, casting uncertainty over how liens would be handled moving forward.\nThe result of it all was\ndeal slowdowns\n, broken underwriting assumptions and increased tension between commercial landlords and homeowners. With no sure fix in place, tax policy remains a key concern heading into 2026.\n",

        "content": "Where Metin Negrin once saw a sales opportunity, he\u2019s instead embracing the office-to-residential conversion trend.\nLexin Capital filed plans to convert 229 West 28th Street in Chelsea from office and retail use to apartments, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n. It\u2019s not immediately clear if the units will be rentals or condos.\nThe conversion plans call for the 12-story, 157,000-square-foot building to expand to a 35-story, 207,000-square-foot residential complex. Most of the space would be residential, though there would also be 3,900 square feet of commercial space; the Department of Buildings application references \u201cgeneral wiring for a nightclub\u201d on the ground floor.\nThe conversion plans were first reported by\nPincusCo\n. In comments to the Observer, Negrin said the project \u201cshows the adaptability of this great property,\u201d mentioning how it started as a printing factory a century ago.\nNegrin\u2019s excitement for the conversion is a departure from a few years ago, when the Lexin owner and president appeared ready to wash his hands of the property.\nLexin bought the property on West 28th Street, dubbed the Caxton Building, in 2014 for\n$81.5 million\nand refinanced it in 2016 with a $73 million loan from Aareal Bank. Lexin put the property up for sale in February 2020, at which time it was 90 percent leased, aiming for a price around\n$138 million\n.\nHe never sold the property, though, and leasing activity collapsed as the pandemic\u2019s impact raged across the office landscape. In 2022, Lexin reached maturity default on the property\u2019s non-performing loan, a $65 million debt an Aareal subsidiary\nput up for sale\nin 2023, when the property was only 58 percent leased.\nMonths later, a buyer emerged for the debt: Lexin itself, putting it in control of the building\u2019s future once more. That future doesn\u2019t appear to include existing office tenants, including health tech company Noom and wedding photographer Edward Dye.\nElsewhere, Lexin put the development site at 75 Nassau Street\nup for sale\nlast summer, seeking a valuation of around $75 million in either an outright sale or stake sale for one of the last 421a-eligible development sites in Manhattan.\nThe site \u2014 zoned for mixed-use residential and commercial and eligible to be developed into a rental or condo building with 253 units \u2014 has yet to be sold.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Columbia Property Trust has been hit with a notice of default tied to San Francisco office buildings six months after the debt matured.\nThe New York-based firm\ndefaulted on a $1.7 billion\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities loan in July and received the notice of default from its lenders on Dec. 17, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The loan was backed by\n650 California Street\nand 201 California Street in the Financial District and five other office buildings across the country.\nThe debt has since grown to $1.9 billion, according to the notice. Lenders could pursue foreclosure if Columbia doesn\u2019t rectify the situation and pay back the money owed.\nThe seven-building portfolio also includes three office buildings in Manhattan, one in Boston and one in New Jersey. Columbia\nsought to sell debt backed by 201 California\nthis summer; as of this fall, lenders were negotiating with Ridge Capital Investors to sell the debt for $75 million, but no deal has materialized.\nColumbia first defaulted on the $1.7 billion loan, originated in late 2021 by a group including\nGoldman Sachs\n, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank, in January 2023, a few months before its scheduled maturity. Columbia negotiated an extension of the loan\u2019s maturity to July 2025, with an additional six-month extension option, according to CMBS data cited by the Business Times. The firm did not exercise the extension option or pay off the loan at its maturity.\nThe seven-building portfolio was appraised at a total of almost $1.3 billion this year, down from nearly $2.3 billion in October 2021. The appraised value of 650 California dropped to $305 million this year from $479 million over the same period. Columbia bought the building in 2014 for $309 million. The 34-story tower was 87 percent occupied as of September 2024, according to the most recent CMBS data available from lenders cited by the Business Times.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",
