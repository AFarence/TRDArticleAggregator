        "content": "Kolter Group bought a condemned waterfront hotel in Miami Beach for $26 million as part of a residential redevelopment play with an adjacent property.\nAn affiliate of Delray Beach-based Kolter, led by Bobby Julien, acquired the 90-year-old Normandy Plaza Hotel at 6979 Collins Avenue, records and real estate database Vizzda show.\nWells Fargo provided a $41 million mortgage that is also secured by the\nCrystal Beach Suites Miami Oceanfront Resort\nat 6985 Collins Avenue. Kolter and Aventura-based BH Group, led by Isaac and Liat Toledano, bought the 84-room Crystal Beach in 2023 for\n$24 million\n.\nVilarino Property Group, managed by Antonio Vilarino in Hollywood, sold the 63-room Normandy Plaza to Kolter. The seller paid $6.7 million for the property in 2007, records show. Built in 1936, the three-story hotel was designed by the late L. Murray Dixon, an architect behind a slew of Art Deco buildings in Miami Beach.\nKolter and BH\u2019s plans to tear down the hotels won approval from the Miami Beach Preservation Board in September. The joint venture is planning a 19-story condominium with 37 units and 86 parking spaces. Miami-based Kobi Karp is the architect.\nThe hotels are not designated historic landmarks, but the properties are in a historic district in the city\u2019s North Beach neighborhood, requiring the preservation board\u2019s review of the redevelopment proposal.\nMiami-Dade County declared Normandy Plaza an unsafe structure and ordered its demolition in 2018, a September letter of intent by the developer states. The building has been vacant since 2013.\nKolter\nand BH listed the Crystal Beach property for sale with a whisper price of\n$110 million\nlast year. However, a source familiar with the redevelopment plan said the joint venture is no longer selling the site. Kolter and BH representatives did not respond to requests for comment.\nKolter and BH also teamed up to develop\nSolana Bay\n, a 10-story waterfront condominium with 52 units in North Miami. Sales for the project launched last year.",

Once complete, the H Mart will span about 100,000 square feet, making it the largest H Mart outpost in the United States.\nH Mart\u2019s Fremont location will operate across two levels and include a food hall and dine-in restaurants as well as its usual grocery offerings, the company and Vestar said, according to the Mercury News. Vestar manages the Pacific Commons Shopping Center where the store will rise. The complex is owned by\nHeitman\n.\n\u201cThe ground floor will feature the grocery store, while the second floor will include a food hall, bar, restaurant and communal spaces,\u201d Carli Richards, a spokesperson for Vestar, told the Mercury News.\nLast month, an East Coast group tied to H Mart CEO Il Yeon Kwon emerged as the\nbuyer of the closed Kohl\u2019s location\n, spending $18.3 million in an all-cash deal for the property, below the building\u2019s assessed value of $26.1 million. Construction on the store is expected to begin by the end of this year.\nBy implementing an \u201cinnovative reuse of a vacant large-format retail space,\u201d H Mart is part of Fremont\u2019s story of companies \u201creimagining vacant commercial properties into destinations that generate jobs, amenities and lasting community value,\u201d Fremont Mayor Raj Salwan said of the development. When complete, it will be the second H Mart store in the East Bay.\nH Mart broke into the Northern California market in 2017 with the opening of a San Jose location. A second San Jose location opened the following year, and a\nSan Francisco H Mart\nstarted welcoming customers in 2021. The company\u2019s first East Bay store is\nin the works in Dublin\n, though its debut has been delayed and an opening date is yet to be determined.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Is this the final cut for the Bel Air speculative mansion known as\nLa Fin\n?\nThe party property at\n1200 Bel Air Road\n, with a nightclub and screening rooms, is back on the market this month with a new price tag of just under $100 million. At roughly 105,000 square feet, the asking price amounts to about $952 per square foot.\nWith the 12-bedroom, 17-bathroom resort-inspired home now out of the nine-figure club, will the new price be just what the property needs to find a buyer?\nSome of the listing agents \u2014 part of a small army from across multiple brokerages \u2014 say yes.\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California CEO and co-founder Aaron Kirman said the thinking behind the new asking price reflects a \u201cmore pragmatic luxury market.\u201d\nThe home\u2019s got its marketing ground covered with some of Los Angeles\u2019 top names tapped to sell the property. Aside from Kirman, that group includes Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\u2019s Tomer Fridman, Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Shauna Walters and Nicole Plaxen, Douglas Elliman\u2019s Jacob Greene and Josh Altman and Compass\u2019 Sally Forster Jones.\nWalters, who made the move to\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\nwith her team co-founder Plaxen late last year, called out market dynamics where discerning buyers are leading conversations with sellers.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had consistent interest around La Fin, and for some time people have been asking the owner to make this move,\u201d Walters said. \u201cIt\u2019s a smart response to today\u2019s buyer mindset.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t the first price cut and the drop does take the mansion below $100 million after testing market appetite first in 2022 with a $139 million ask.\nSince then, the property has seen several reductions, including the most recent in October, when the listing price moved to $108.9 million before exiting the market in December.\nA significant point to consider is the\nMeasure United to House L.A.\ntwo-tier tax, which applies to all real estate deals within the city of Los Angeles starting at $5.3 million. The so-called mansion tax would no doubt apply to a trade of La Fin, triggering the higher 5.5 percent levy on the deal.\nAt the home\u2019s original asking price of $139 million, that equates to $7.6 million. If the home trades at its current listing price, the ULA tax pencils out to $5.5 million.\nThe estate sits on over 2 acres and was built by real estate investor and physician Joseph Englanoff, who paid $5 million for the property in 2014. The home\u2019s highlights are many and include the acceptance of payment in crypto, a six-car vehicle display elevator, spa, wine cellar, cigar lounge, rock climbing wall and massage room.\nEnglanoff\u2019s name is well-known in L.A. real estate as he was also a lender on Nile Niami\u2019s\nThe One\nspec mansion at 944 Airole Way in Bel Air, which at one time sought $295 million. The property was sold at auction in 2022 to\nRichard Saghian\n, founder of fast-fashion company\nFashion Nova\n, for $141 million.\n",

        "content": "After a year of plummeting value and questions about 225 Bush Street\u2019s fate, the downtown San Francisco office tower appears poised to emerge from its pit of distress.\nLenders have\nbegun the process of selling\na $350 million nonperforming loan tied to 225 Bush Street, the San Francisco Business Times reported. The special servicer overseeing the note is reportedly in discussions with JLL about putting the loan on the market, multiple people with knowledge of the matter told the Business Times. A formal listing has yet to emerge.\nBuilding owner Kylli\ndefaulted on the note in November 2024\n, and the 22-story tower\u2019s lenders have floated various options to settle the nonperforming debt, including working out a deal with Kylli, listing the debt for sale and pursuing foreclosure at the site. By putting the debt up for sale, a buyer could either move to foreclose on 225 Bush or arrange a deal with Kylli to take ownership of the 580,972-square-foot building.\nKylli, a subsidiary of Chinese investor Genzon Investment Group, acquired a majority stake in 225 Bush Street, once the headquarters of Standard Oil Corporation, in 2014. At the time, the building\u2019s value was placed at $350 million. In 2019, Kylli bought a minority stake from San Francisco-based Flynn Properties and refinanced the building with the $350 million loan. The building\u2019s appraised value that year was $589 million.\nIn December 2024, after the owner stopped making payments on the loan, the\nbuilding\u2019s appraised value dropped\nto $153 million, or approximately $263 per square foot. Last August, lenders sued to have the building placed into receivership, putting management operations in the hands of a third party rather than Kylli. Douglas Wilson of Douglas Wilson Companies was appointed as receiver that month, and the firm has been working with JLL on leasing at the building since then, according to San Francisco Superior Court documents cited by the Business Times.\nThe property at 225 Bush is hardly the first San Francisco office building to fall into loan default after the pandemic. Last month, Columbia Property Trust\nreceived a notice of default\nafter missing payments on\na $1.7 billion\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities loan backed by\n650 California Street\nand 201 California Street, both in San Francisco\u2019s Financial District, and five other office buildings across the country. In October, lenders\nfiled a lawsuit\nto initiate foreclosure proceedings at 55 Hawthorne Street after CIM Group defaulted on a $61.5 million loan backed by the property.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The Dallas Mavericks are zooming in on the hunt for their next home court between two sites within the city limits, but the final call may still be months away.\nThe NBA franchise is now focused on a downtown Dallas location and the former Valley View Center property, a 110-acre tract at Preston Road and I-635, according to\ncomments\nfrom Mavericks CEO Rick Welts. Speaking to the Dallas Morning News, Welts said the team has been working closely with city officials to advance the two options.\n\u201cWe have identified, with the city, two city of Dallas locations that we are focusing all our time and attention on now, and hoping to bring one of them to success,\u201d\nWelts\ntold the outlet.\nA downtown site could include the land beneath\nDallas City Hall\n, though that option hinges on whether the city ultimately preserves or demolishes the I.M. Pei\u2013designed building. Other downtown parcels have been floated in recent months, including land near the planned convention center overhaul.\nNorth Dallas\u2019 Valley View site, once home to a regional mall, emerged as the other frontrunner. The property\u2019s size makes it attractive for what the team has described as a large-scale mixed-use entertainment district anchored by a new arena.\nThe long-discussed county jail site at 111 Commerce Street has also surfaced as a\ntheoretical option\n, though Dallas County officials have said no formal talks have taken place. The jail sits on 15 acres of riverfront land owned by the county. The property is valued at $109 million, appraisal district records show.\nNo decision is imminent. The Mavericks\u2019 lease at the American Airlines Center runs through 2031, and Welts acknowledged that an earlier goal to announce a site by the end of March has slipped. He now expects a decision closer to July 1, at about the end of the NBA season, according to the publication.\n\u201cRight now, our hope is somewhere around July 1 \u2026 that we are in position to be able to make a decision,\u201d Welts told the outlet, adding that factors beyond the team\u2019s control have pushed the timeline back.\nLast summer, Dallas\nhired\nHillwood Urban Services for $75,000 to help identify and evaluate potential sites for a new NBA arena.\nWelts emphasized that time is tightening, despite the long runway.\n\u201cWe want to open in 2031,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means we\u2019re on the clock.\u201d\nFor a roughly 50-acre mixed-use district with an arena and public spaces, he added, the development timeline is anything but leisurely.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "To conduct its much-maligned crackdown, Immigration and Customs Enforcement needs real estate. One pursuit in the Hudson Valley is being met by swift resistance.\nICE is attempting to buy a warehouse at 29 Elizabeth Drive in Chester, Bloomberg\nreported\n. The owner of the warehouse is an affiliate of billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who didn\u2019t comment to the local press, other than to say he became aware of the situation through a local newspaper.\nLast trading hands at the end of 2021, the warehouse is 60 miles from Manhattan and 15 miles from the airport, relevant when considering ICE\u2019s typical operations under the Trump administration. The property was last valued by Orange County at $25 million.\nThe buyer is one part of the controversy, as recent action in Minneapolis deepened the unpopularity of Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies.\nThe uproar also pertains to ICE\u2019s likely use for the facility, should a purchase go through. A public notice on the Department of Homeland Security website proposes a guard building, improved security fencing and an outdoor recreation area, all of which seem to point to a detention center.\nNot even local members of Trump\u2019s party are on board with the possibility of a detention center in Chester. Orange County executive Steve Neuhaus, a Republican, opposes an ICE conversion of the facility, preferring to see it redeveloped for light manufacturing or film studio space.\nCongressperson Pat Ryan, a Democrat, submitted a petition with more than 10,000 signatures to DHS, opposing ICE\u2019s pursuit of the warehouse, according to\nNews 12\n.\nThe budget for ICE is one of the flashpoints in the latest government funding fight, though it\u2019s unclear if Democrats have the stomach to push back on full funding for the agency. Last time around, Congress approved $45 billion for expanded enforcement and detention operations as ICE pursues \u201cmega-centers\u201d that can hold thousands of detainees.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Eastdil Secured has zeroed in on 601W as a buyer for a distressed, Brookfield-owned office tower on Bunker Hill in downtown Los Angeles.\nThe New York City-based investment company is in talks to purchase the\nmortgage loan\non 333 South Grand Avenue, which encompasses Wells Fargo Center \u2014 North Tower and the retail spot connected to it, for $180 million, knowledgeable sources in the downtown Los Angeles office sector said. The deal has not closed, according to an informed source.\nA $180 million deal for the 54-story, 1.4 million-square-foot office tower at the northern part of L.A.\u2019s Financial District, comes out to about $130 per square foot. That doesn\u2019t account for the three-story retail atrium, which is another 60,000 square feet. Either way, it is nowhere near the debt of $506 million or so that\u2019s in default on the Wells Fargo Center\u2019s North Tower.\nEastdil declined to comment. Neither Brookfield nor 601W responded to requests for comment.\nThe sister Wells Fargo Center \u2014 South tower is not included in the deal; Newmark is\nshopping\nthat one.\nLate last year, there were four Brookfield-related\nofferings\nthat accounted for almost a fifth of Class A office space throughout downtown\u2019s Financial District, including Bunker Hill: EY Plaza, Bank of America Plaza and Wells Fargo Center, the twin tower skyscraper complex.\nThe near-deal on the North Tower could fall through \u2014 a turn that came to pass last year on Carolwood\u2019s $130 million deal to purchase EY Plaza at 725 South Figueroa Street, another office building owned by Brookfield, but in a receiver\u2019s hands. Carolwood\u2019s deal collapsed in due diligence. The note later came back to market and there are\nrumblings of a deal\n.\nThe Well Fargo North Tower is 61 percent leased, and the Halo, the retail property, is only 35 percent leased, according to an earlier marketing memorandum. The distressed debt on the real estate includes a mezzanine loan from Oaktree Capital Management, in which Brookfield owns a controlling interest. Brookfield could own Oaktree entirely if its bid to acquire the remaining interest in Oaktree, which was once headquartered at the North Tower, goes through.\n",

        "content": "The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is facing backlash from veterans over a plan to build up to 800 tiny homes this year on its West Los Angeles campus.\nThe proposal, which\nsurfaced this week\nduring a federal court hearing, calls for the construction of hundreds of 8-by-8-foot sheds to house veterans, the Los Angeles Times reported. Critics, including veterans themselves, argue that the small structures that are often used as quick fixes for homelessness are cramped, inaccessible and unfit for lengthy stays.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s suitable at all,\u201d said Rob Reynolds, an Iraq war veteran who was part of a 2022 federal lawsuit asking for more housing. That effort also called for an end to\nleases of large portions of the 388-acre campus\nto outside interests such as the University of California, Los Angeles, and the Brentwood School.\nThe more than 100 tiny homes already installed near San Vicente Boulevard have already proven problematic, particularly for residents using wheelchairs and walkers. Fire safety and durability have also emerged as concerns.\nIn 2024, U.S. District Court Judge David O. Carter ordered the VA to build more than 2,500 units of temporary and permanent housing on top of an earlier mandate for 1,200 permanent units. In December, an\nappeals court upheld that order\n. Carter questioned in the hearing on Tuesday whether relocating homeless veterans from Skid Row to small sheds on the Westside would meaningfully improve their situation and suggested money might be better spent elsewhere.\nThe tiny home push also risks colliding with a\nseparate directive from President Donald Trump\nin May. The president\nissued an executive order\nestablishing a National Center for Warrior Independence on the West Los Angeles campus, envisioned to include housing for up to 6,000 veterans. VA officials have not clarified whether the sheds are meant to satisfy the court order, advance the Warrior Independence center housing or both.\nThe additional residences would replace a parking lot and grass field next to the existing tiny home village alongside San Vicente Boulevard. The VA has enough funds in its current authorization to complete the temporary housing by the end of 2026, but not enough for the permanent housing portion, Robert Fleck, acting principal general counsel for the VA, told the court.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Arselle and Amoroso spent $22 million in August to acquire Alur, a 51-unit property in Pasadena; in October they dropped $44 million for the 119-unit Sofi Topanga complex in Chatsworth and $23 million for the 48-unit Terraces at La Cienega in West Hollywood.\nWith the Amonte platform, Arselle and Amoroso plan to focus on adding high-quality assets in suburban and infill locations in markets with robust demographics, job growth and barriers to new supply.\nAmoroso owns a portfolio that includes hospitality, medical office and self-storage assets in addition to the nearly 8,000 residential units the company has developed, owned or operated, mostly in the Western United States. Since its founding in 1978, the firm has invested in approximately $550 million of real estate assets.

        "content": "Naperville slammed the brakes on a proposed data center this week, rejecting a project that had become one of the most contentious land use fights the Chicago suburb has seen in years.\nAfter months of organized opposition from nearby residents, the City Council voted 6 to 1 to block Karis Critical\u2019s plan for a data center near Naperville and Warrenville roads. The Daily Herald\nreported\nthat neighbors warned the\nfacility\nwould overwhelm local power infrastructure, generate constant noise and introduce diesel emissions into an area surrounded by housing. Most council members ultimately agreed.\n\u201cAll the neighbors have been exhausted by this process,\u201d said James Butt, a nearby resident and technologist who has consulted for data center operators. \u201cI know that everyone is relieved.\u201d\nThe site sits amid a growing cluster of residential neighborhoods, a key factor in the council\u2019s decision. Several members argued that while data centers are increasingly essential infrastructure, this location was a poor fit \u2014 particularly as Illinois grapples with grid constraints and surging demand from hyperscale users.\nCouncil member Supna Jain cited uncertainty around future electricity availability and cost, noting that neither ComEd\u2019s system nor the city\u2019s municipal utility has unlimited capacity. Approving the project, she said, could crowd out other development along the I-88 corridor or saddle the city with costly upgrades.\nThe developer had already scaled back its ambitions. Naples, Florida-based Karis\nreduced\nthe proposal to a roughly 145,000-square-foot facility and agreed to cap power usage at 36 megawatts under a negotiated development agreement. That translated to about 24 megawatts of information technology load, according to project attorney Russ Whitaker. The revision also cut the number of diesel generators on site from 24 to 16, 12 of them dedicated to backup power.\nFive data centers have already gone up in Aurora, with five more entitled and two new applications filed just before the moratorium took effect. Developers have\nclustered data centers\nin recent years near O\u2019Hare International Airport, especially in Elk Grove Village, and an office tower in downtown Chicago sold last year to a Virginia company planning to convert it into a 33-megawatt data center.\nWhitaker asked the council to delay a vote so that updated air dispersion modeling could be presented, arguing the reduced scope materially changed emissions assumptions. Mayor Scott Wehrli supported tabling the decision, calling it premature for a project pegged as a half-billion-dollar investment. The effort failed. Wehrli and council member Nate Wilson abstained, while council member Josh McBroom cast the lone vote against rejection.\nThe concerns went beyond\nscale\n. Opponents argued the project conflicted with the city\u2019s own master plan, which envisions medium-density residential development on the property. Council member Ian Holzhauer pointed to Naperville\u2019s housing shortage, suggesting the land could ultimately have more public benefit as homes rather than servers.\nKaris said it is reassessing its options. A spokesperson told the publication that the firm had committed to investing hundreds of millions into a \u201cbest-in-class\u201d facility and is now evaluating other sites across the region.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Instead, the partners are moving forward with a $275 million refinancing that includes nearly $40 million of fresh equity and another $25 million earmarked for future leasing costs, capital improvements and other expenses.\nThe prewar, 470,000-square-foot building was about 37 percent vacant as of October, featuring roughly 200,000 square feet of office space to fill. The retail portion is spoken for: Bergdorf Goodman\u2019s men\u2019s store occupies the base. Upstairs, tenants enjoy Central Park views.\nControl of 745 Fifth changed hands last month when\nRithm acquired Paramount Group\n, which bought the building in 2002 for $263 million. Paramount had previously explored conversion options, part of a broader wave of Midtown landlords testing whether obsolete offices could pencil out as housing.\nRithm declined to spell out why the conversion was shelved, but costs loom large. The city comptroller\u2019s office has pegged the conversion of 750 Third Avenue at $663 per square foot. Applied to 745 Fifth, that kind of pricing would push a resi overhaul north of $300 million.\nInstead, ownership is betting that spectacular views and the building\u2019s Fifth Avenue address \u2014 across from the Plaza Hotel and next door to LVMH\u2019s new tower \u2014 will be enough to pull in tenants willing to pay for prime Midtown space.\nIn a statement, Rithm said it sees \u201cstrong demand for high-quality space\u201d and expressed confidence in the long-term fundamentals of New York\u2019s premier office corridors.\nThat optimism isn\u2019t happening in a vacuum. Manhattan leasing hit 42 million square feet in 2025, the busiest year since before the pandemic, according to Colliers; volume was up 25 percent from 2024.\nWhile large swaths of older office inventory remain distressed, trophy assets in elite locations have been telling a different story.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A Miami projects review board greenlit two workforce and affordable apartment projects that will add nearly 730 units to the city.\nThe urban development review board approved The Cornerstone Group and Brookstone Partners\u2019 plan for 354 units in Little Havana, and Atlantic Pacific Companies\u2019 375 rentals in Overtown.\nThe board only has the power to recommend approval, denial or design tweaks, with the ultimate authority resting with the Miami planning director.\nHere\u2019s more about the planned developments:\nCornerstone, Brookstone workforce rentals in Little Havana\nThe Cornerstone Group and Brookstone Partners\u2019 second attempt at project approval succeeded.\nThe firms, based in Hollywood, plan an eight-story building with 354 apartments at workforce rents on a 2.4-acre site at 805 West Flagler Street in Little Havana. The project will have a roughly 5,000-square-foot retail space for a grocer or pharmacy. A rooftop pooldeck is planned, along with two courtyards spanning 8,000 square feet each, one of them with a dog park.\nThe project failed its first shot at\nUDRB in November\n, prompting Corwil Architects to come back with a redesigned building. Revised renderings show curving balconies, among other changes, with board members largely hailing the tweaks as improvements.\nVice Chair Gia Zapattini said the Flagler Street-facing fa\u00e7ade still needs work.\n\u201cThe goal is really for a pedestrian to not experience an almost 400-foot long fa\u00e7ade,\u201d she said.\nAlberto Cordoves of Corwil Architects said breaking up the massing was the goal in the redesign, and architects can further work on it by adding more glazing.\nBoard member Manuel Gustavo Gallardo argued 5,000 square feet is too small for a grocery store or pharmacy, but the developers\u2019 attorney, Melissa Tapanes Llahues, said this will be a mini-market because demand doesn\u2019t support a full grocery store due to recent additions nearby such as the\nBlock 55\nproject.\nThe board\u2019s approval came with conditions to further break up the fa\u00e7ade fronting Flagler Street, study other types of balcony railings, especially for the units on the ground floor and facing the courtyards, and provide more details of the landscaping.\nAtlantic Pacific Companies\u2019 Culmer Place V in Overtown\nAtlantic Pacific Companies scored approval for the second phase of its Culmer Place affordable housing project in Miami\u2019s Overtown, despite some board members\u2019 concerns with the design.\nMiami-based Atlantic Pacific plans the seven-story Culmer Place V project with\n375 apartments\n, including 94 units reserved for \u201cextremely low income\u201d residents and the majority for households earning up to 80 percent of the area median income.\nMiami-Dade\u2019s annual AMI is $87,200, according to the Florida Housing Finance Corporation, though that will be updated in the spring.\nThe development adds to the recently completed 239 affordable units on the site, at 801 Northwest Seventh Avenue. Atlantic Pacific received temporary certificates of occupancy for the first two buildings and the amenity building late last year, said Nicole Wolfe, an attorney for the developer.\nThe firm is leasing the nearly 14-acre site, formerly home to a public housing complex, from Miami-Dade under a 99-year term. Culmer Place is constructed in phases in part to avoid displacement of existing residents. Redevelopments of Miami-Dade public housing generally give renters the right of first refusal for the new apartments.\nCulmer Place V also is designed by Corwil Architects. Board members brought up similar issues with the design of this project as they did with Cornerstone and Brookstone\u2019s Little Havana building.\n\u201cThere\u2019s another 376-foot long building, and I have a hard time seeing the separation. I know you changed the material, but I see a giant 400-foot long concrete block,\u201d Zapattini said. \u201cIt\u2019s very repetitive.\u201d\nIn his presentation, Sergio Rodriguez of Corwil said \u201cspecial attention was given to the design of the fa\u00e7ades \u2026 [adding] vertical and horizontal bands working in conjunction.\u201d\nBoard members brought up issues with the lack of natural lighting in portions of the building and long internal corridors and walkways from the garage, which could pose difficulties for elderly residents.\nThe board approved the project with several conditions for tweaks, including to break up the fa\u00e7ade, add glazing at the end of a hallway adjacent to the garage, including landscaping and benches, add double doors at some of the pedestrian building entrances, create more privacy for some of the ground-floor units and add signage to the site.\nCorwil Architects\u2019 representative said designers are amenable to those changes.\nLive Local Act projects can skip UDRB\nTwo Live Local Act projects on the agenda skipped the board hearing, after the developers and the city attorney\u2019s office determined a review by such a committee isn\u2019t necessary under state law.\nThe Florida Legislature approved the Live Local Act in 2023, tweaking it in subsequent years. It allows developers to bypass public hearings and obtain administrative approvals if they designate 40 percent of units for households earning no more than 120 percent of the AMI.\nCrescent Heights\nplans\n1,307 units\nwith a 50-story tower housing 780 market-rate apartments and a 28-story building with the 527 workforce apartments. The project is proposed for the site at 3180 Biscayne Boulevard, a few blocks north of Crescent\u2019s\nForma\napartment tower completed last year.\nAlso, an entity with ties to Brickell-based Momentum Real Estate Partners wants to develop a 12-story Live Local project with 195 units and nearly 4,000 square feet of ground-floor retail.\n",

        "content": "A heavy equipment firm scored approval for its headquarters on more than 200 acres outside Miami-Dade County\u2019s Urban Development Boundary, including paving over wetlands in a plan to develop a headquarters.\nCounty planning staff members opposed the proposal and recommended commissioners deny the application, which has riled environmentalists decrying the loss of wetlands necessary for flood mitigation.\nMiami-Dade is generally a developer-friendly county where officials for years have accommodated project proposals. But the county has its limits, drawing a\nhard line\nagainst construction outside the urban development boundary. That invisible line was drawn to restrain suburban sprawl onto wetlands, farmland and open land, and toward the Everglades to the west and Biscayne National Park to the east.\nHeavy equipment firm Kelly Tractor wants to move its headquarters outside the boundary, including building over about 160 acres of wetlands near Sweetwater and opening a facility where it would sell, store and repair machinery, WLRN\nreported\n. Kelly Tractor, based in Doral, owns more than 245 acres outside the UDB.\nMiami-Dade commissioners on Thursday voted in favor of the proposal for a text amendment to label the site as \u201cMIA Transportation and Infrastructure Support Area,\u201d imposing several conditions for wetland mitigation and for the project site plan to come back as an administrative site plan application.\nCounty planners\u2019 recommendation for denial says Kelly Tractor failed to show why it can\u2019t expand at its current Doral site and why it needs the UDB expansion, pointing out the county has about 700 acres of land for industrial development within the boundary.\nBesides that, taxpayers would be on the hook for water, sewer and other infrastructure expansions for the project, and Kelly Tractor\u2019s filing showed no mitigation plan for the wetlands, which are considered top tier in the county.\nKelly Tractor, which didn\u2019t respond to the outlet\u2019s request for comment, said the project is necessary for infrastructure projects such as highways and prisons.\nAn attorney for Kelly Tractor said at the meeting the firm has outgrown its current space and the county has no site within the UDB large enough for the firm\u2019s expansion.\nWetlands \u200a\u201care very functional. They\u2019re part of the solution for flooding for [Miami-Dade County],\u201d Laura Reynolds, science director at Hold the Line Coalition, told WLRN. \u201c\u200aSweetwater floods all the time and, these are the things that should be considered when we make these decisions.\u201d\nOver the years, Miami-Dade has taken up other applications for development outside the UDB, many of them proving contentious.\nLennar, the second biggest homebuilder nationwide, is partnering with developer Ed Easton and homebuilding consultant Bill Albers on the proposal for\nCity Park\nwith 7,800 homes and 2.4 million square feet of commercial space, including schools, and public parks outside the UDB. While proponents say this \u201ccity within a city\u201d will be self-contained, opponents argue it would worsen congested traffic headed to employment hubs. The project is expected to come up for a vote later this year.\nDevelopers Stephen Blumenthal and Jose Hevia scored commission approval in 2022 for their\nSouth Dade Logistics &amp; Technology District\non 379 acres outside the UDB. The vote came after five tries in front of commissioners, with the developers agreeing to concessions, including roughly halving the project size. South Dade Logistics was later\nquashed in court\nin 2024.\u00a0\u00a0\u2013\nLidia Dinkova\n",

This first phase of the project will include a proposed 450 apartments on an 8.6-acre stretch between 2101 and 2201 Donley Drive, according to\ncity documents\n. It is less than a mile from the Q2 Stadium, home to Austin FC. The entire mixed-use development also will include land across the street, from 2111 to 2115 Kramer Lane. TDLR filings are preliminary and subject to change.\nTurnbridge proposed 450 multifamily units on the 8.6-acre stretch of Donley Drive and persuaded the city of Austin to\nrezone the area\nfor tall, dense development last year. Currently, four commercial buildings operate on the property. Under the city\u2019s new zoning, the land can accommodate mixed-use residential construction up to 491 feet high, or about 45 stories.\nHowever, the developer\u2019s submitted plan for 2101-2201 Donley Drive describes a wood-framed, six-story multifamily building. The ground floor will include retail elements. The multifamily building will have an adjacent seven-story precast parking garage, according to the filing.\nA Turnbridge associate named in the filing did not immediately respond for comment.\nTurnbridge acquired the acreage, now called the Q2 Assemblage, between 2019 and 2020 for an undisclosed price as the Q2 Stadium was taking shape. The stadium opened in 2021, coinciding with the launch of\nAustin FC\n.\nThe development will be about two miles from The Domain, a residential, office and retail center in Northwest Austin. Companies that\nlease\nor operate at The Domain include\nIndeed\n,\nIKEA\n,\nWeWork\nand\nPayPal\n.Another developer,\nBrandywine Realty Trust\n, plans to build a mixed-use campus at 11501 Burnet Road, across from The Domain, after IBM vacates it next year.\n",

        "content": "Loews Hotels is doubling down on Arlington\u2019s entertainment district, unveiling plans for a third hotel that would replace the aging Sheraton near Globe Life Field with a sprawling, high-end convention property.\nThe New York-based hotelier plans to build the 507-room Americana by Loews Hotels at 1300 Ballpark Way, tearing down the existing 311-room Sheraton Arlington Hotel that dates to the late 1980s, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n. The project will include 39 suites and more than 83,000 square feet of meeting and event space, capped by a 10,000-square-foot event barn.\nThe Sheraton is\nslated for implosion\nin early June, with construction on the new hotel expected to begin later this summer. Loews projects an opening in late 2028 or early 2029. Total investment is expected to exceed $500 million, Loews Hotels President and CEO Alex Tisch told the outlet.\nThe project is designed to capitalize on growing demand for hotel rooms and large-scale meeting space in Arlington, which has increasingly positioned itself as a meetings and events hub \u2014 not just a game-day destination. Tisch said proximity to Dallas, Fort Worth and DFW International Airport has helped lure corporate events, including from Fortune 500 companies.\n\u201cWe bought the Sheraton property thinking that there may be a greater opportunity in the future,\u201d Tisch told the publication, calling the site one of the last major development opportunities in the district.\nThe redevelopment will free up roughly 13 acres. A new parking garage will serve the hotel and surrounding venues, though only about half the land is slated for the hotel and garage. The remaining acreage is unprogrammed for now, though Tisch said the company has zoning and financing flexibility for future development.\nThe city of\nArlington\nis backing the project through a public-private partnership approved by City Council in late 2023. The city is expected to contribute $40 million toward development costs and provide more than $57 million in grants over 25 years if performance benchmarks are met, according to the outlet.\nLoews\nwill front the initial capital.\nAmericana by Loews takes its name from the late, iconic Americana Hotel in Bal Harbour, Florida, a Loews landmark that opened in 1956.\nThe site sits less than a mile from Loews\u2019 recently opened\nArlington Hotel &amp; Convention Center\n, an 888-room property that opened in early 2024 between Globe Life Field and Choctaw Stadium. Loews also opened the $150 million, 300-room Live! by Loews Hotel in 2019.\nWhen complete, Loews\u2019 Arlington campus will total nearly 1,700 rooms and more than 374,000 square feet of meeting space.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A mixed-use project near San Antonio\u2019s River Walk, years in the planning process, is now moving forward.\nMcCombs Enterprises landed a favorable zoning change Tuesday for its 6-acre site at\n326 West Jones Avenue\nand Camden Street, clearing another hurdle for a dense, multi-building development along the northern stretch of the San Antonio River. The San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\nthat the city\u2019s Zoning Commission unanimously approved an infill designation for the property, allowing multiple structures to rise on the site. The item moved through consent without opposition.\nThe San Antonio-based firm, founded by late billionaire Red McCombs, had previously said in 2023 that it was partnering with Denver-based developer Realberry \u2014 formerly known as McWhinney \u2014 on the project. A revised site plan filed with the city envisions eight buildings totaling more than 1 million square feet, marking a significant expansion from earlier concepts.\nWhile individual building heights weren\u2019t specified in the latest filing, the plan sets a maximum height of 15 stories. A December version showed a range of three to 17 stories. The project will have up to 390 apartments, roughly 265,500 square feet of office space, 57,400 square feet of food and beverage and about 58,600 square feet of retail.\nRecords released in 2023 showed an earlier plan called for 325 apartments and just 70,000 square feet of offices, with an estimated development cost of $295 million. The latest iteration points to a much larger project in the River North submarket, which has been steadily filling in with residential, cultural and office projects tied to the Museum Reach extension of the River Walk.\nMcCombs\nbought the property from CPS Energy in 2023 for $29.5 million. The site is expected to leverage a\nmunicipal management district\ncreated by the Texas Legislature that same year, giving the development the ability to levy property taxes and issue bonds to help fund infrastructure and other improvements.\nThe zoning change still needs final approval from the San Antonio City Council at a future meeting.\nThe project adds to a growing downtown San Antonio presence for the McCombs family. The firm is part of the team of developers transforming the 30-story, 240,000-square-foot\nTower Life\noffice tower into affordable apartments at 301 South Saint Mary\u2019s Street.\nIn 2024, the family bought out the ground lease beneath the former Holiday Inn at 318 West Cesar Chavez Boulevard, gaining full control of the 4.5-acre property near Hemisfair. The late Red McCombs helped develop the hotel ahead of Hemisfair \u201968.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A long-simmering family feud over a sprawling New York real estate portfolio has flared up again.\nSteve Jemal filed a new lawsuit this week in Manhattan Supreme Court accusing his brother, Alan Jemal, and their mother Ruth of siphoning money from a network of jointly owned real estate companies, cutting him out of management decisions and using the businesses as \u201cpersonal piggy banks.\u201d\nThe suit targets ten limited liability companies that own properties across the city, from Harlem to Brooklyn and the Bronx. Together, the entities hold a portfolio that has been controlled for years by members of the Jemal family and has been the source of a bitter back-and-forth.\nSteve alleges that Alan and Ruth have essentially seized control of the businesses and refused to provide access to the books, leaving him \u201cblind as to his cash flow,\u201d per the suit. Alan and Ruth allegedly moved money between entities, paid themselves management fees and used company funds to cover personal expenses ranging from luxury car leases to charitable donations and streaming subscriptions, the suit alleges.\nSteve claims his monthly distributions were slashed while the other family members continued to receive larger payments, per the complaint. In addition to monetary damages, Steve is asking the court to appoint a neutral receiver or permanent third-party manager to run the companies.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the family has ended up in court. The brothers previously battled over the same portfolio in a series of lawsuits filed in 2020, which were settled in June 2022. The alleged misconduct has continued, prompting the latest action, per the suit.\nLawyers for Steve and Alan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "Overlooked amid the Trump administration\u2019s steady beat of stunning news \u2014 ICE actions, the Greenland takeover threat, the Venezuela incursion \u2014 is a steady beat of actions targeting criminals.\nUnfortunately, these criminals are being targeted not for arrest and prosecution, but for clemency and pardons. They are all white-collar crooks, some convicted of duping mom-and-pop investors.\nThese crimes often involve real estate schemes, where smooth-talking businessmen (they\u2019re always men, it seems) round up money to invest in properties offering robust returns.\nInstead, they spend the money to support a high-flying lifestyle involving fancy cars, luxury travel, Rolex watches and expensive restaurants. Creating an image of success allows them to raise more money from new and repeat victims before it all unravels.\nIn recent years, another kind of real estate fraud has been popping up. In this scheme, the victims are not unsophisticated investors \u2014 or investors who are just smart enough to think they cannot be fooled.\nInstead, they are lenders and government-sponsored entities such as Fannie and Freddie. This kind of fraud has kept\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s Keith Larsen\nbusy\nfor the past two years.\nMy question is, why is President Donald Trump letting any of these people out of their sentences? And he\u2019s not waiting until the waning days of his term, like he did\nlast time\n.\nTrump seems immune to the normal rules of politics. The fact that one\nserial fraudster\nhe pardoned in 2021 went\nright back to committing crimes\nhasn\u2019t slowed the president\u2019s pardon operation. Nor have\nstories about victims\nof criminals he\u2019s freed.\nIn the\nlatest example\n, Trump erased Brooklyn developer Jacob Deutsch\u2019s\nfive-year prison term\n, fine and related penalties.\nDeutsch and cousin Aron\nran this scheme for years\n, forging documents to inflate property values and then borrowing against them.\nDeutsch forged signatures on leases and filled empty apartments with furniture and clothing so visiting lenders would think they were occupied. He even doctored utility bills and fabricated bank deposits to show rental income.\nTrump let Jacob but not Aron Deutsch off the hook. Recently the president did the same for the Long Island-based leader of a\nmajor fraud\nbut not any of his\naccomplices\n. The Department of Justice said its own prosecutors in the latter case had trumped up the charges, but if that\u2019s true, shouldn\u2019t the president have wiped out all of the resulting convictions?\nTrump haters probably think he\u2019s selling pardons, but that seems illogical given that he\u2019s already found safe ways to amass\nat least $1.4 billion\nduring his presidency.\nSomething else is going on here. At some point it\u2019s going to come out.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nL+M Development Partners and SMJ Development plan 2,035 apartments to replace the current 209 homes at 1754 Fulton Street and 53 Utica Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Part of the site is city-owned, so HPD is involved.\nThe publication didn\u2019t mention City Council member Chi Oss\u00e9, who is poised to negotiate the rezoning. Oss\u00e9\nbelieves in adding supply\n, so chances are this will go through despite any ill will between him and the mayor, who just\nchased him out\nof a congressional race. Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Some years ago, the public advocate began fact-checking its \u201cworst landlords list\u201d before publishing it, to avoid embarrassing mistakes. That practice must have fallen by the wayside, because 35th on its new list is Ariel Belen, who is not a landlord at all \u2014 he\u2019s a\nretired judge\nwho served 18 years on the bench.\nBelen was named a receiver for two troubled Bronx buildings: 214 East 168th Street and 1235 Morris Avenue. It took me three minutes on ACRIS to\ntrace the buildings\nto Isaac Kassirer, who bought buildings at prices later rendered\nunsupportable\nby the 2019 rent law. Sabal Capital owned the debt on those two buildings.\nJoseph Cafiero, No. 4 on the \u201c\u2018worst landlords\u201d list, called me Wednesday to say he, too, is a receiver. Also on the list are\nPeter Fine\nand\nDavid Kramer\n, who have been tapped repeatedly by HPD as reliable operators of affordable housing.\nElsewhere\u2026\nTRD\n\u2019s Lilah Burke looked at Summit Properties\u2019 Tel Aviv Stock Exchange\ndisclosures\nfor more information on its winning bid to buy a 5,141-unit, mostly rent-stabilized portfolio. But one number I\u2019m curious about is how much it will raise from TASE investors, given that it\u2019s already borrowing $338.5 million from Flagstar Bank for the $451.3 million purchase.\nIt appears possible that Summit will close without putting much of its own money into the deal, which always makes a buyer look smart if its plan works out \u2014 and makes the banks and bondholders look foolish if it doesn\u2019t.\nSummit is paying 5.25 percent interest on the Flagstar loan. That\u2019s $17.8 million a year for the first two years. It will have to pay higher interest for the TASE debt. For the sake of argument, let\u2019s say it bonds out the remaining $112.8 million at 8 percent interest \u2014 that\u2019s $9 million a year. It predicts net operating income of $36 million. Subtract $27 million in debt service. Even if its NOI doesn\u2019t account for $6 million a year in planned capital expenditures, it looks like Summit could clear $3 million a year without putting anything down.\nThe Mamdani administration had said Summit was\npaying too much\nto be able to\nmaintain the buildings\nand also pay back its loans. Now it has the blueprint for how Summit intends to do exactly that.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$10.6 million\nfor a 3,700-square-foot condominium unit at 3 Morton Square in the West Village. Glenn Davis, Alex Andrejko, and Shaun Anders with Serhant had\nthe listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$43.7 million\nfor a 16,123-square-foot commercial property at 90 Wooster Street in SoHo. JSRE Acquisitions paid\n$48.5 million\nin 2013.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$11.75 million\nfor a 4,042-square-foot condominium unit at 257 West 17th Street in Chelsea. Kirk Rundhaug, Sean Johnson, and Jordan Christensen at Compass have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 62,705-square-foot, 94-unit residential building at 469 Troy Avenue in Prospect Lefferts Gardens. Leandro Dickson filed the permit on behalf of Yonah Grunhut with the Grun Group.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

But $1 million-plus condo sales fell 5 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2024.\nAcross Miami-Dade County, single-family home sales rose 3 percent year over year in the fourth quarter. A quarter of those sales were all-cash deals. Condo sales were flat, and half of those were all cash, according to Analytics Miami.\nJonathan Miller, a housing expert who authors Douglas Elliman\u2019s quarterly residential reports, said nearly every market Elliman monitors in Florida showed double-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter.\nThe Miami area has benefited from the slide in mortgage rates and the strength of the financial markets, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incrementally improving market from a transaction standpoint,\u201d he said.\nElliman has reduced the number of cities it taps Miller to track, and in Miami-Dade it now only releases reports on the following:\nMiami Beach, barrier islands\nIn Miami Beach and the barrier islands, which include Bal Harbour, Bay Harbor Islands, Fisher Island, Golden Beach, Indian Creek, Key Biscayne, North Bay Village, Sunny Isles Beach and Surfside, residential sales rose 17 percent to 749 closings. The median sale price fell 3 percent to $745,000, according to the Elliman reports.\nThe story changes when looking at condos versus single-family homes. Eighty-five single-family homes traded in the fourth quarter in the barrier island markets, up just one sale more than the same period in 2024. The median price surged, up 22 percent to $3.7 million.\nCondo sales jumped 19 percent to 664 closings, while the median price tumbled, down 10 percent year over year to $587,500.\nLuxury home sales, defined by Elliman as the top 10 percent of market share, were flat at just nine closings. And condo sales in this price segment increased 21 percent to 68 sales.\nMiller said this market is more of a one-off, and not an indicator of a greater pattern.\nCoral Gables\nNinety-nine single-family homes sold in the fourth quarter in Coral Gables, up 22 percent year over year. Condo sales experienced similar gains, rising 37 percent with 63 closings. Marketwide trends in pricing are seen in the Gables too: the median price for a single-family home was flat at about $1.9 million, and it dropped 8 percent to $530,000. Sales rose in the top 10 percent of deals, as did pricing.\n",

        "content": "Another luxury name is trading North Michigan Avenue for the Gold Coast.\nDavid Yurman signed a lease to open a new Chicago store at 933 North Rush Street, replacing its longtime location at 919 North Michigan Avenue, according to people familiar with the deal. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat the move puts the New York-based jeweler squarely in the city\u2019s tightest luxury retail corridor, where\nvacancies are scarce\nand rents have held firm even as the broader retail market recalibrates.\nYurman will take roughly 5,000 square feet currently occupied by Versace. It\u2019s unclear whether the Italian fashion house plans to relocate elsewhere in Chicago. Prada Group, Versace\u2019s parent company, did not respond to a request for comment. The space Yurman is leaving at 919 North Michigan is owned by Nuveen Real Estate, a unit of TIAA.\nThe Rush Street address \u2014 also known as 40\u201348 East Walton Street \u2014 sits at the heart of the Oak, Rush and Walton triangle, long considered Chicago\u2019s most exclusive shopping strip. The building is home to other high-end fashion tenants including Dior and Brunello Cucinelli, underscoring the area\u2019s allure for luxury brands seeking dense clusters of affluent foot traffic.\nThe property is owned by a venture of JMB Realty, the Chicago firm led by billionaire Neil Bluhm. JMB and a CBRE broker representing the landlord did not respond to requests for comment. CBRE brokers Luke Molloy, Danny Jacobson and Stephen Ansani had been marketing the Versace space for lease.\nYurman\u2019s move follows a well-worn path. In recent years, Cartier, Chanel and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels have all exited the\nMagnificent Mile\nfor Oak Street, reflecting a broader repositioning of luxury retail in Chicago.\nWhile the Mag Mile remains the city\u2019s most visible shopping boulevard, it continues to wrestle with elevated vacancies and uneven foot traffic after the pandemic, though those vacancies are on the rebound. Lower rents and the return of major brands like\nAritzia and Uniqlo\n, along with new experiential retail, are fueling the comeback.\nAs of the third quarter,\nvacancy\nalong North Michigan Avenue stood at about 28.7 percent, down from the 2024 bottom of 34 percent, according to brokerage Kirsch Agency, even as leasing momentum has slowly improved. The Kirsch Agency\u2019s study projects that leasing could double by the end of this year, falling below 24 percent retail vacancy.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Zillow\u2019s\nstandoff with the Chicago area multiple listing service\nremains in limbo this month after the MLS warned last year that listings on the public home search website could be interrupted in January.\nMidwest Real Estate Data (MRED), the MLS operator for Chicago and the surrounding area, sent a message to subscribers in December saying that Zillow officials had been telling brokerages they were \u201canticipating disruptions to listings flowing to Zillow via MRED beginning in the first week of January,\u201d and asking the brokerages to sign direct listing feeds.\nBut so far, it appears Zillow hasn\u2019t started enforcing its listing standards in MRED\u2019s coverage area, according to people familiar with the matter, and Zillow\u2019s access to listings in the region appears uninterrupted.\nThe long-brewing stalemate stems from Zillow\u2019s\nupdated listings standards\ndesigned to curb the growth of brokerage-exclusive listings nationwide. The rules also affect MRED\u2019s Private Listing Network, which allows sellers to show listings to agents in the Chicago area market and their clients, but not to the broader public. Agents who put a listing on the private market and then move to public \u2014 a common tactic for testing prices and part of Compass\u2019 three-phased marketing strategy \u2014 would receive a warning, and eventually have those listings blocked from appearing on Zillow.\nEven while Zillow has enforced its listing standards around the country, it has kept the status quo in Chicago, as it has been working with MRED to resolve the impasse, Zillow previously told\nThe Real Deal\n. MRED has\ndug in on defending the private network\nand said that Zillow could face retaliation, including being cut off from the MLS\u2019 listing feed, for enforcing its standards.\nThe standoff also coincides with changes that allow MRED agents to hide details like price history and days on market when they\u2019re displayed on public portals like Zillow, based on a message MRED sent to some subscribers obtained by\nThe Real Deal.\nIn the message from 2025, MRED said it was adding new display permissions for agents when they put a listing into the MLS, which would begin in January. Notably, the MLS added two new fields allowing agents to hide price history and time on market from the public feeds that Zillow and other portals receive their data from.\nThe new options \u201cenable [MRED\u2019s] brokers and their sellers to have more control over their listings and how they are displayed online,\u201d MRED wrote in the email.\nMRED and Zillow did not respond to requests for comment.\nZillow released an analysis late last year\nclaiming MRED\u2019s private network\nreinforces \u201cdigital redlining,\u201d finding that homes in Chicago\u2019s majority-white neighborhoods were more than twice as likely to be listed on the private platform, compared to those in majority non-white areas. The portal giant argued private listings disadvantage buyers and threaten market transparency.MRED fired back,\naccusing Zillow of using fair housing\nconcerns to mask a strategic play to protect its own revenue by ensuring all listings hit its public site. The MLS defended its Private Listing Network as a necessary option for sellers requiring privacy during sensitive life events \u2014 such as divorce or illness \u2014 and pointed to internal data showing private listings sell faster and for a higher percentage of their asking price.",

        "content": "Accessory dwelling units are poised to become the hottest new housing model in Berkeley after a thumbs-up from city officials.\nThe Berkeley City Council\napproved a proposal\nthat would allow property owners to sell structures such as backyard cottages, basement apartments and other ADUs as condominiums, Berkeleyside reported.\nUnder the new ordinance, property owners will be able to get fast-tracked approval to turn their ADUs into condos without having to go through a public hearing or appeals process. Owners also won\u2019t have to pay fees that the city usually charges to convert units from rental apartments to condos. Homeowners will have to submit a map to the city outlining how they would split up their property. The measure also gives tenants in some older rent-controlled\nADUs\na three-month window to make the first offer to buy their units.\nCity leaders hope that offering ADUs for sale will help create more opportunities for homeownership in the notoriously expensive East Bay city. The median price for a single-family home is approximately $1.4 million and nearly no new condos have been built in decades, according to Berkeleyside.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to create more housing inventory that\u2019s available for less than $1 million \u2014 and hopefully substantially less than $1 million,\u201d Council member Brent Blackaby said at a meeting Tuesday night where the Council approved the change.\nBerkeley homeowners have warmed up to ADUs as a source of rental income or space for family members such as older parents, hence the common\n\u201cgranny flat\u201d\nnickname. Since 2018, the city has issued an average of about 100 building permits for ADUs each year.\nThe change makes Berkeley the latest Bay Area city to embrace selling ADUs as condos. Last year, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously passed\nan ordinance allowing the construction\nand sale of the small units on homeowners\u2019 lots.\nFederal lawmakers have taken notice of ADUs\u2019 role in making homeownership more attainable. Last summer, California Rep. Sam Liccardo \u2014 who represents San Jose \u2014 and New York Rep. Andrew Garbarino proposed the bipartisan Supporting Upgraded Property Projects and Lending for Yards\n(SUPPLY) Act\n, which provides government-backed, flexible financing options to help homeowners break ground on ADUs. The legislation also directs the Federal Housing Administration to provide government backing for second mortgages to finance ADU construction and also permits\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac\nto purchase and securitize those loans.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Nuveen Green Capital and Lone Star PACE facilitated the financing. Blom is going to use the funding to make energy efficient updates to the property\u2019s lighting, HVAC, building envelope and hot water system, according to loan documents.\nIn nearby Celina, Irving-based JPI scored $23.5 million in C-PACE funding for the development of Jefferson Ownsby, a 436-unit apartment complex JPI is building at 317 East Ownsby Parkway. Aquarian Holdings and PACE Equity facilitated the financing.\nPrinceton\n, which is about 43 miles northeast of Downtown Dallas, was named the\nfastest-growing city in the country\nin 2025. The Collin County town grew by more than 30 percent from July 2023 to July 2024, bringing its population to just over 37,000 \u2014 more than double what it was at the start of the decade, according to Census estimates.\nCelina is about the same distance from Dallas as Princeton, but due north. Its spot in the North Dallas growth path means it\u2019s been crowned the nation\u2019s fastest-growing city in the past.\nThe growth in Princeton and Celina explains the interest from multifamily developers and investors in providing housing for these markets. It\u2019s a marked difference from the Dallas-Fort Worth multifamily market as a whole, which has been dampened in recent years by tens of thousands of new units coming online at the same time.\nC-PACE has become a\npopular option\nfor developers and investors while institutional lending is still tight. It can be used for up to 25 percent of a project\u2019s capital stack.\n",

She touted her State of the State priorities, including a\nproposal\nto reform environmental review.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to continue working with all of you as an ally, to break down barriers, and create the incentives you need,\u201d she said. \u201cI, like you, am sick and tired of the red tape that makes sure that your projects go through hell and back before they ever get done.\u201d\nHochul, who is running for re-election this year, also nodded to the perennial joke \u2014\u00a0but also fact\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0that gala guests often talk over whoever speaks at the event.\nShe said Karen Keogh, secretary to the governor, warned that she should expect a \u201cfeisty\u201d crowd.\n\u201cMy response was, \u2018If they want me to listen to them when they come to Albany, they better listen to me tonight,\u2019\u201d she said.\nAt the end of her speech, she said the crowd wasn\u2019t as bad as last year and that she would talk about policies with Whelan and REBNY Chair Jed Walentas.\nThe gala, which attracts the biggest names in real estate, can also be a temperature check, a way to gauge the political toxicity of the industry at the moment.\nOther elected officials spotted during cocktail hour \u2014 either by\nTRD\nor fellow guests \u2014 included City Council Speaker Julie Menin, state Attorney General Letitia James, City Comptroller Mark Levine, Council member Kevin Riley, state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, Assembly member Kalman Yeger, Council member Eric Dinowitz, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards and Bronx Borough President Vanessa Gibson.\nNassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, a Republican who plans to challenge Hochul, was also there.\nThe landmarked Waldorf Astoria was reopened last year after a\n$2 billion condo conversion\n. Part of the cocktail hour was in the Basildon Room, which offered any wallflowers a chance to admire the gold and silver leafing on the walls, the restored frescoes on the ceiling and the floral carpet, which is blessedly not original to the room but whose design is inspired by its predecessor.\nEarly in the night Soloviev Group\u2019s Michael Hershman said the mayor\u2019s absence was a \u201cmissed opportunity.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the best interests of the real estate community and the mayor to be able to sit down and talk about what\u2019s best for the city, what\u2019s best for the people of the city,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we do that with kind of an open mind, I think we can find common ground.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Miami-Dade County\u2019s scramble to keep cruise ships fueled up at PortMiami is colliding with\nFisher Island\u2019s\nquest to wipe out the last industrial holdout in one of the country\u2019s priciest ZIP codes, setting up a constitutional showdown over eminent domain and due process.\nFisher Island Club\nand Fisher Island Community Association recently sued Miami-Dade to stop the county from seizing a nearly 10-acre fuel depot that Chicago-based\nHRP Group\nbought last year for $180 million. HRP plans to convert the site into luxury condos.\nThe club is led by CEO Sase \u201cSasha\u201d Gjorsovski, and the community association is led by president Roberto Sosa. HRP, led by CEO Roberto Perez, is not a party in the lawsuit.\nA spokesperson for the Miami-Dade County Attorney\u2019s Office declined comment. An HRP spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\nJames Ferraro, an attorney for the club and the association, said county officials have multiple alternatives for a new home for the fuel depot.\n\u201cIt is an antiquated facility that is not compliant with current standards,\u201d Ferraro said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for it to go.\u201d\nThe complaint, filed Wednesday in Miami federal court, alleges the county\u2019s threatened condemnation is unconstitutional and flouts eminent domain laws because it is driven by \u201cgovernmental convenience\u201d in favor of private cruise lines rather than genuine public necessity. The plaintiffs also accuse the county of skipping over basic planning, a safety analysis and procedural fairness.\nThe property, a fuel farm long operated by\nTransMontaigne Partners\n, sits roughly 700 feet from homes and about 2,000 feet from an elementary school serving more than 160 children on a barrier island with no road access, the lawsuit states.\nThe terminal stores roughly 28.3 million gallons of marine fuel in tanks the plaintiffs allege are not up to date with fire codes and sit in a hurricane flood zone. The county has not produced any analysis that would justify extending the facility\u2019s life with appropriate safeguards for Fisher Island residents and employees, according to the suit.\nAn HRP-led entity closed its purchase of the fuel depot in October and agreed to allow TransMontaigne to continue operating the fuel facility until 2027 when a county lease to store boat fuel at the facility expires.\n\u201cWe have been counting days for that lease to terminate,\u201d Ferraro said. \u201cWe fully expected that facility was going to be phased out.\u201d\nHRP, which specializes in redeveloping contaminated sites, has been positioning the property as the \u201clast remaining\u201d large-scale condominium site on the ultra-luxury island with an expectation the fuel tanks would be decommissioned and the site remediated for high-end residential.\nMiami-Dade and HRP negotiations\nHRP entered a development agreement with the Fisher Island Club and the neighborhood association that would carve out 4 acres of the fuel farm site for community improvements, according to the lawsuit.\nIn exchange, the club and the association pledged to support entitlements, grant memberships to condo buyers worth millions of dollars and help HRP navigate government approvals.\nThe association has veto power over any sale or conveyance of the 4 acres, except in circumstances such as a foreclosure or a scenario where HRP fails in good faith to obtain development approvals, the suit states.\nThe complaint asserts the association has the right to control its portion of the site if there is a partial taking by eminent domain, as well as a contractual veto over lease renewals with the county beyond 24-month terms for a six-year period if entitlement approvals lag.\nDespite those recorded rights, the suit claims, the county cut\nFisher Island\nout of backroom talks with HRP that will determine the future of the property.\nIn October, before HRP closed the deal, county commissioners approved a resolution authorizing administrators to acquire the site \u201cby purchase or eminent domain\u201d and to enter private mediation with HRP to negotiate the terms. Miami-Dade elected officials decided to take the property after heavy pressure from the cruise line industry, the complaint alleges.\nWith mediation deadlines passed and Miami-Dade now able to file an eminent domain petition \u201cat any moment,\u201d the club and the association are asking a judge to force the county back to the drawing board.\nThe two entities argue that the county\u2019s taking of the fuel bunker must be supported by a rigorous analysis and a transparent process, not a last-minute scramble to keep the \u201cCruise Capital of the World\u201d running on business as usual.\nSelf\u2011inflicted crisis\nThe lawsuit paints Miami-Dade\u2019s predicament as an institutional failure years in the making.\nFor more than a decade, county business plans never flagged its 2027 lease expiration on the Fisher Island terminal, even though the site is the primary fuel source for cruise and cargo ships at PortMiami, which local officials say underpins tens of billions of dollars in economic impact, the lawsuit alleges.\nAfter TransMontaigne listed the site in 2024 with an asking price of\n$200 million\n, the firm rejected a county purchase offer. Jimmy Morales, the county\u2019s chief operating officer, publicly acknowledged that Miami-Dade officials did nothing to find alternative sites, the lawsuit claims.\nWhen Miami-Dade officials learned that HRP was close to finalizing its purchase, county staff rushed out a bare-bones Oct. 7 report that identified nine alternative sites but dismissed them without feasibility studies, cost-benefit analysis, environmental review or long-range planning, the suit alleges.\nCommissioners themselves expressed doubts about taking the fuel depot at a public meeting in September.\nCommission Chairman Anthony Rodriguez Jr. questioned why the county was \u201ceven talking about eminent domain to a private parcel in the most expensive ZIP code in the country,\u201d and County Commissioner Danielle Cohen-Higgins questioned why they were being asked to act \u201ca week before the closing\u201d with little notice to property owners, according to the complaint.\nThe Fisher Island groups argue that the county\u2019s \u201ccondemnation first, justification later\u201d approach violates the public-use and \u201creasonable necessity\u201d prongs of Florida\u2019s eminent domain law because the fuel facility primarily benefits private cruise lines.\nThe complaint notes that county documents reference fuel barges from nearby ports like Port Everglades as a viable way to maintain operations without seizing Fisher Island land. TransMontaigne also reportedly offered to put up $200 million toward a modern fuel depot at PortMiami that would occupy roughly 1 percent of the 520-acre port.\nFerraro, the attorney for the club and association, said county taxpayers would end up footing the bill if Miami-Dade is allowed to go through eminent domain, which requires government agencies to pay property owners fair market value.\n\u201cTaxpayers will get totally burned,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is going to cost a lot of money to buy it \u2026 and then the county will need to replace the facility. That requires taking the old one down and building a new one. They are going\u00a0 to be spending maybe $500 million.\u201d",

        "content": "A Blackstone-owned Seattle office tower could be underwater \u2014 literally.\nFrankfurt-based Dekabank alleges in a lawsuit that Blackstone Property Partners\u2019 fund failed to repair and maintain the 23-story Exchange Building in Downtown Seattle, allowing \u201cpersistent water intrusions\u201d through the property windows, requiring a full repair of the building facade.\nDekabank, the lender on the property, alleges Blackstone\u2019s inaction has been \u201cdisastrous\u201d and led to at least $17 million in repairs.\nThe German lender further alleges Blackstone was more concerned with the bottom line than the state of the property. Blackstone put off maintenance that would have prevented the water damage, according to the lawsuit.\nDekabank filed the lawsuit in New York Supreme Court on January 21. Blackstone strongly denies the allegation in a statement.\n\u201cDekabank\u2019s claims are without merit,\u201d said a spokesperson for Blackstone. \u201cWe have been responsibly managing this asset since our acquisition in 2017 and are disappointed with the path Dekabank has chosen to take. We will respond in the ordinary course as part of the legal process.\u201d\nDekabank provided an initial $97.1 million loan to Blackstone for the office tower in Downtown Seattle in 2017. Blackstone hired its affiliate Equity Office Management as the property manager.\nIn 2022, Blackstone refinanced the tower again with Dekabank. As part of the refinancing, Blackstone allegedly entered into a carry guarantee, which ensured it would cover operating expenses associated with the project, the lender claims.\nAccording to the lawsuit, Blackstone would have to satisfy 18 different conditions in order for the carry guarantee to expire, including a certification showing it paid all operating expenses.\nDekabank alleges Blackstone failed to satisfy two of the requirements and the carry guarantee remained in place.\nAs it sought to assess whether Blackstone satisfied the conditions of the carry guarantee, Dekabank claims it performed extensive due diligence on the property. During this time period, the loan matured, according to Dekabank\u2019s lawsuit.\nThe lender hired a consultant to perform a wide-ranging evaluation of the property site, structure, facade and windows.\nDekabank called the consultant\u2019s results \u201cshocking.\u201d The property allegedly suffered substantial damage to its facade. The building required $17.2 million in short-term repairs with an additional $13.1 million required in reserves, according to Dekabank.\nPortions of the fa\u00e7ade were exhibiting \u201cdeficiencies and evidence of deferred maintenance,\u201d according to Dekabank.\nWater was allegedly able to infiltrate the property in several locations. The chief engineer of the property even revealed that he was aware of active leaks on the fourth, fifth, 16th, 18th and 21st floors, according to the lawsuit.\nThe property manager also confirmed there had been water leakage issues through the windows and walls of the property since at least 2018, the lawsuit alleges.\n\u201cBorrower undertook little more than band-aid repairs, which were insufficient to stem the tide of water pouring into the property and causing widespread damage,\u201d Dekabank said in its lawsuit.\n",

Vornado developed the borough\u2019s sole purpose-built film studio alongside joint venture partners Hudson Pacific Properties and Hudson Pacific Properties.\nThe lease encompasses about a third of the facility, which includes 232,000 leaseable square feet, six soundstages, support space and offices. Paramount intends to use the space to film the second season of the Michael C. Hall-starring \u201cDexter: Resurrection,\u201d which streams on Paramount+.\nThe length and asking rent of the lease were not disclosed and the owners of the studio could not immediately be reached for comment by the publication. The average asking rent for Manhattan industrial space in the fourth quarter was $32.17 per square foot, according to JLL.\nBlackstone and Hudson Pacific\njoined\nthe studio project in August 2023. Alongside Vornado, the three companies invested $350 million in the venture, a public-private partnership with the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation.\nPerks provided to the developers included $73.5 million to repair and maintain the pier until 2060, as well as a starting rent of a mere $900,000 per year, which isn\u2019t due to escalate to a $2.8 million peak until the end of a 99-year lease.\nThere\u2019s also a state program providing financial incentives to studios that produce two or more projects and spend at least $100 million in the state.\nVornado owns a 49.9 percent stake in the studio, while Hudson Pacific has a 25.6 percent stake and Blackstone owns the rest.\nNew York has long been a\ndominant player\nin the country\u2019s studio space sector, despite the impenetrability of Manhattan due to high development costs and a lack of available space.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Supply-chain management firm Havi is the anchor tenant, leasing roughly 96,400 square feet.\nHavi\nis a major vendor to McDonald\u2019s, whose\nglobal headquarters\nsits a few blocks away and helped cement Fulton Market\u2019s status as the city\u2019s hottest office submarket.\nSterling Bay launched the project in 2021 with a construction loan just shy of $70 million from Bank OZK. Cook County property records show the loan has been amended several times, most recently last year, pushing its maturity to August. While the pending maturity might add some urgency, no obvious signs of distress exist, making the deal a cleaner test of investor appetite than many recent office trades.\nThe sale comes on the heels of Colorado-based Real Capital Solutions\u2019 $132.5 million purchase of the office tower at\n401 North Michigan Avenue\n, the city\u2019s priciest office deal since 2022, according to the publication.\nPeople familiar with the Morgan Street building said its recent completion in 2022, Fulton Market location and relatively modest deal size could draw a broader buyer pool and stronger pricing than Chicago office sales have seen in years. JLL brokers Jaime Fink, Bruce Miller, Sam DiFrancesca and John Mason are handling the offering.\nThe listing also might provide a clue to Sterling Bay\u2019s shifting strategy. Once the dominant force for Fulton Market\u2019s transformation from meatpacking district to corporate hub \u2014 including McDonald\u2019s headquarters and Google\u2019s Midwest outpost \u2014 the developer has been shedding properties after its Lincoln Yards megaproject stalled. Last year, it sold a neighboring multifamily site at\n350 North Morgan\nStreet for $18 million, and it is no longer involved in Lincoln Yards after separate developers took over the site\u2019s north and south parcels.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Time is ticking for opponents of NYCHA\u2019s West Chelsea redevelopment plans and the clock just ran out on a short-lived legal challenge from a former state senator.\nA judge denied a recent challenge brought by former state Sen. Thomas Duane to block the public housing authority\u2019s project, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The judge declined to grant an injunction that would\u2019ve halted the planned demolition and rebuilding of the Fulton and Elliott-Chelsea Houses.\nIn his ruling, the judge criticized the plaintiffs for their failure to bring the lawsuit sooner, claiming they knew demolition was imminent in late November, but took another month to file the complaint.\nLate last month, Duane\nfiled\nthe lawsuit, claiming NYCHA\u2019s plan for the site was illegal because it involves leasing the properties to Related Companies, ostensibly in violation of a state law dating back to 2010, which requires NYCHA to control the site.\nThe judge said the plaintiffs couldn\u2019t \u201cdemonstrate they are likely\u201d to win the case. An attorney for the plaintiffs said they would appeal.\nNYCHA\u2019s $2 billion plan to demolish and rebuild the pair of properties has run into several roadblocks.\nIn November, a judge\nrefused\nto order two senior citizens residing in the Fulton and Elliott-Chelsea Houses to immediately vacate. Most of the residents are able to stay in place while work is done to build the forthcoming properties, but some are being asked to temporarily relocate and not all are willing, leading to a rash of lawsuits.\nNYCHA and Related\nfiled plans\nfor a 12-story, 217-unit building at 401 West 19th Street over the summer.\nThe development team, also featuring Essence Development, is replacing more than 2,000 public housing units. They will also build retail and commercial space, as well as 3,500 mixed-income apartments, 1,000 of which will be put aside at affordable rates.\nThe Public Authorities Control Board recently approved the redevelopment of the first apartment tower, a project expected to cost $1.2 million per unit. NYCHA is still awaiting federal approval, which an attorney for the housing authority said could happen anytime.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Hundreds of apartments, a sprawling pickleball club and a growing lineup of entertainment tenants are taking shape in north Fort Worth, where developer Steve McKeever says his long-gestating North City project is finally hitting its stride.\nThe mixed-use development will span roughly 148 acres within a larger assemblage McKeever controls and is positioned in a triangle below North Tarrant Parkway, west of I-35W and northeast of US 287. The Dallas Business Journal\nreported\nthat McKeever\u2019s plan is an \u201curban village\u201d that blends apartments, entertainment and retail in an area McKeever argues is long on rooftops and jobs but short on destination experiences.\nMcKeever owns more than 300 acres, split between tracts north and south of U.S. 287. Once fully built out, he estimates total development value will exceed $1.1 billion. His focus, he said, is turning the northern portion into a pedestrian-friendly entertainment hub \u2014 something he believes north\nFort Worth\nlacks, despite its proximity to\nAllianceTexas\n.\nThat nearby master-planned development, spanning 27,000 acres, has generated more than 66,000 jobs and an estimated $130 billion\neconomic impact\nsince 1990, according to the outlet.\nConstruction cranes are already in the air. Miami-based multifamily firm Resia is building a 465-unit apartment complex on 8 acres, while Carrollton-based Cross Developer, in a joint venture with McKeever, is underway on a 233-unit project nearby. The partners plan to break ground this summer on another 354-unit development, with a third apartment phase planned roughly two years later.\nOn the experiential side, McKeever is opening a 16-court pickleball facility dubbed City Pickle USA on Jan. 31. The club is designed as more than a sports stop, featuring a full gym, wellness offerings and a sports bar \u2014 a kind of stay-all-day idea North City is chasing, according to McKeever.\nRetail is already anchoring the broader development. Major tenants include a 100,000-square-foot Andretti Indoor Karting and Games, furniture retailer Living Spaces and used-car vending machine operator Carvana. McKeever said density will be key to attracting the next wave of tenants, which could include a grocery store, a concert or music venue and potentially a\nhotel\n.\nThe project has gone through multiple iterations, including a period when Ikea explored the site before backing away. McKeever also said he lost 14 deals during the pandemic. Operating largely solo, McKeever said patience is part of the strategy.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The suburban Chicago office market closed 2025 in a deeper hole than ever, as vacancy climbed to a fresh record and reinforced fears that the post-pandemic hangover for landlords \u2014 and local tax bases \u2014 is far from over.\nOffice vacancy across the suburbs ended the year at 32.9 percent, up from 32.4 percent in the\nthird quarter\nand 32 percent at the end of\n2024\n, according to new data from JLL first\nreported\nby Crain\u2019s. Vacancies set an all-time high every quarter for five straight years, a stunning reversal from early 2020, when vacancy stood at 22.1 percent.\nThe numbers highlight a widening mismatch between supply and demand in a market built around sprawling corporate campuses that no longer align with how companies use space. Remote and hybrid work have permanently shrunk tenant demand, while much of the suburban inventory consists of aging buildings that companies see as functionally obsolete.\nLandlords and lenders are taking hits as values fall, while municipalities that once relied on office parks as\ndependable revenue engines\nare facing growing uncertainty, according to the outlet.\n\u201cThere is a lot of suburban office space that doesn\u2019t need to be office space in the future, and it\u2019s not going to get absorbed,\u201d JLL Vice Chairman Dan McCarthy said. For vacancy to meaningfully retreat, he said, demand must improve and supply must shrink \u2014 neither of which moved much at the end of last year.\nTenants gave back roughly 371,000 more square feet than they occupied during the fourth quarter, pushing total negative net absorption for 2025 past 720,000 square feet, according to JLL. Verizon trimmed its space in Rolling Meadows by about 20 percent as part of a lease extension, while Aldi exercised an option to terminate a 113,000-square-foot office lease in Naperville.\nSince the start of 2020, suburban tenants have shed about 5.3 million square feet. By comparison, the suburbs lost roughly 3.2 million square feet during the Great Financial Crisis from 2008 to 2013, according to the report.\nLeasing volume\nalso appears to have reset lower. Companies signed about 4 million square feet of suburban leases in 2025, down 14 percent from the prior year and well below the roughly 7 million square feet inked at the market\u2019s 2018 peak.\nStabilization now hinges on how quickly obsolete offices are removed. Nearly 6 million square feet have been taken offline over the past five years, pushing total suburban inventory below 95 million square feet for the first time since 2007. Another 2.2 million square feet is slated for demolition or redevelopment, including office-to-industrial and sports-related conversions.\nEven so, distress is mounting. In October, the owner of the 1.1 million-square-foot\nWestbrook Corporate Center\nin Westchester was hit with a foreclosure lawsuit tied to a $99 million mortgage.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Veroushka Maclean Volkert with One Sotheby\u2019s International Realty and Vilma Datorre with Datorre Realty Group had the listing. Betsy Rauch with VG Luxury Properties Realty brought the buyer.\nReinhart started his National Hockey League career in 2014 with the Buffalo Sabres, and joined the Panthers in 2021. He won back-to-back Stanley Cups with the team in 2024 and 2025, and is one of the league\u2019s top goal-scorers.\nBusquets is considered one of the best defensive midfielders in soccer. He played for FC Barcelona from 2008 until he and teammate\nLionel Messi\njoined\nInter Miami\nin 2023. He retired in December.\nBusquets and his wife, Elena Galera, bought the Seneca Road home for\n$8.7 million\nin 2023. Built that year on 0.3 acres, the 7,100-square-foot home has seven bedrooms, six bathrooms, one half-bathroom and 100 feet of waterfront on Lake Seneca.\nThe home is in the gated community\nSea Ranch Lakes\n, a tiny, private village just outside Fort Lauderdale. The community spans just 0.2 square miles and is almost entirely walled. It has its own police force and mayor, with fewer than 200 homes and a private beach club.\nIts small size and security features have proven popular with professional athletes over the years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very chill. We\u2019ve had NFL players, NBA players, race car drivers, executives,\u201d Volkert told\nThe Real Deal\nin 2023. \u201cPeople are respectful, and it\u2019s private, and they respect their privacy.\u201d\nHomesellers could benefit from the attention star athletes bring to the community. Another Seneca Road home sold for a record $13 million in October, according to records. A waterfront home in the community at 34 Minnetonka Road is on the market asking $20 million. Compass agent Tim Elmes has the listing.",

Shvo did not name the tenant, who he said wished to remain anonymous.\nThe deal for the 44th floor space is a West Coast record, according to Shvo, though the Chronicle could not verify the claim. The\nTransamerica Pyramid\nis reportedly the only building in the city to have leases with rents over $200 per square foot, which has only happened over the past year, local real estate sources told the Chronicle.\nTwo more leases have been completed for upper floors of the building, Shvo confirmed to the Chronicle. Tech-focused global investment firm Coatue and Japanese bank\nMizuho\ngrabbed space in the building. The Coatue, Mizuho and unnamed tenant\u2019s leases total 25,000 square feet, with the largest spanning 15,000 square feet, a Shvo spokesperson told the Chronicle. The rental rates were not disclosed, though tenants on the higher floors pay higher rents, the spokesperson said.\nShvo\u2019s team completed nine deals for more than 200,000 square feet in the building last year with rents between $120 and $300 per square foot, according to the Chronicle. The structure was 85 percent leased as of last month. In 2024, the building\ncompleted $400 million worth of renovations\nto revamp offices and offer new amenities and public-facing spaces.\nTransamerica Pyramid\u2019s new leases come as the office market in the city appears to finally be turning around from post-pandemic struggles. Office space in San Francisco that was vacant or available for lease\ndecreased by nearly 2 million square feet\nin the fourth quarter of last year \u2014 the steepest drop in office availability in four consecutive quarters.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Since 2022, when Petrusan took over as landlord duties from her late father, four tenants have filed civil suits against the landlord and nine have filed for restraining orders, claiming they experienced a pattern of threatening behavior through physical and verbal assaults.\nPetrusan denied any wrongdoing. \u201cWe don\u2019t harass [tenants],\u201d she told the Times. \u201cWe say \u2018hi.\u2019\u201d\nOne tenant, Olga Moreira, claims Petrusan sprayed another tenant with bear mace in 2022 and that the toxic spray got into her eyes, requiring medical attention. Moreira claimed Petrusan\u2019s boyfriend, Jeremy Noor, threatened her with a rifle, according to an application for a restraining order. Moreira also claimed that Noor set fire to her Jeep Cherokee, which Petrusan denied.\n\u201cIf we lit her car on fire, then I would have to do that to the other 20 people in here that don\u2019t pay me. Like with my kids. I can\u2019t give one something if I don\u2019t give the other something,\u201d Petrusan said.\nAnother plaintiff, Adriana Montes de Oca Cervantes, alleges her wrist was fractured when she was attacked by Petrusan\u2019s pit bull in April 2024. That case is still pending. Petrusan denied her dog ever bit Cervantes; the tenant provided medical records to the Times showing she visited California Hospital Medical Center in April 2024 and was diagnosed with an open fracture of her right wrist from a dog bite.\nOther tenants claim in court documents that Petrusan threatened to call\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement\non them, which Petrusan also denies. \u201cI didn\u2019t threaten to call immigration. If I called immigration, all my tenants would leave,\u201d Petrusan, an immigrant from Romania, told the Times.\nAdditional cases against Petrusan allege the landlord failed to maintain sanitary conditions or safe doors and didn\u2019t fix broken plumbing, among other issues. The cases are still open, and Petrusan has reportedly stopped showing up to court appearances, David Albright, a\nLos Angeles Tenants Union\norganizer who works with residents at the building, told the Times. A warrant for Petrusan\u2019s arrest was issued on Nov. 12 after she did not appear for a court date, per records reviewed by the Times.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Lisle officials hit pause on a proposed data center after opposition from residents spilled out of Village Hall, adding another setback to data center development across suburban Chicago.\nThe village\u2019s planning and zoning commission postponed a scheduled public hearing Wednesday night after more than 300 residents packed the building, exceeding capacity limits for the board chambers and an overflow room, Mayor Mary Jo Mullen said. The Daily Herald\nreported\nthat the hearing was set to address a proposal by the developer Cloud Centers to build a 256,000-square-foot, 50-megawatt data center on the long-vacant former Lockformer property at 711 Ogden Avenue.\nThe 18-acre site has been dormant for more than two decades and carries complications, according to the publication. Lockformer\u2019s former manufacturing operations contaminated local drinking water with toxic chemicals, a legacy that still looms large for residents. Mullen called the episode \u201ca really difficult time for Lisle,\u201d adding that the history makes redevelopment of the site especially sensitive.\nCloud Centers\u2019 proposal calls for a large-scale facility that would tap nearby power infrastructure. Project documents note that the ComEd-owned Lisle substation sits within roughly 500 feet of the property, making it one of the few\nsuburban sites\ncapable of supporting a 50-megawatt load \u2014 a key selling point as data center developers scour the region for power-ready land.\nBut proximity cuts both ways. Residents argued the project is too close to homes, pointing to a subdivision across Ogden Avenue and a residential street less than 300 feet from the site. Concerns include diesel backup generators, constant mechanical noise and emissions from cooling systems.\n\u201cI\u2019m not anti-data center, but being less than 300 feet away from homes seems dangerous,\u201d said Lisle resident Vanessa Berry, who has helped organize neighborhood opposition. What started as a lightly attended meeting in December has quickly snowballed. The outlet reported that about 40 residents showed up to a gathering Berry organized last week, and the village said it has received nearly 250 emails about the proposal, most opposing it.\nThe postponement came a day after Naperville\u2019s City Council\nvoted down\nits own proposed\ndata center\n, citing similar fears about power strain, noise and diesel emissions in residential areas. That vote appears to have energized opponents in\nLisle\nand heightened pressure on local officials.\nVillage Manager Jeffrey Cook said the hearing must be rescheduled with at least 15 days\u2019 public notice and that the proposal will not be discussed again until then. A representative for Cloud Centers could not be reached for comment.\nWhile Mullen said it\u2019s too early to take a position, she suggested municipalities may need clearer regional or statewide guidance as data center demand accelerates.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a Lisle issue,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to figure out how to do this safely and reasonably without harming residents.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

With the building\u2019s assessed value tumbling more than 60 percent, the city lost tens of millions of dollars in taxable value. City officials had pegged 60 Spear at a $121.8 million valuation in fiscal year 2023. By fiscal year 2025, the assessment dropped to $41.8 million. As a result, Presidio Bay\u2019s annual property tax bill fell to about $494,000, down about 65 percent from the more than $1.4 million Clarion paid in its final year of ownership.\nOffice properties account for approximately 17 percent of San Francisco\u2019s\nproperty tax\nbase. Under California\u2019s Proposition 13, assessed values can only rise 2 percent annually unless a building changes hands. When properties sell below their assessed value, the reset locks in a lower tax base that may take decades to recover from.\nOther downtown office buildings are selling below their peak-era valuations and prior tax assessments, trading at $200 to $400 per square foot. City officials say general fund property tax revenue fell almost 0.9 percent in the fiscal year ending June 2025 and has grown less than 2 percent in three of the past five years, according to the Business Times. In the past, property tax reliably climbed at or above the 2-percent Prop 13 cap.\nA surge of assessment appeals has only made the growing problem worse. The\nSan Francisco Office of the Assessor-Recorder, which handles the appeals, is working through a backlog of thousands of requests. Before the pandemic, the office would typically receive around 1,400 appeals per year, San Francisco Assessor-Recorder Joaquin Torres told the Business\nTimes. In\nfiscal year 2024, it received 8,000 appeals; the number increased to 9,000 in 2025, which Torres said is an \u201cat least 25-year high.\u201d\nMayor Daniel Lurie, for the time being, is planning to work with building and community stakeholders, as well as the Board of Supervisors, to deliver a budget that \u201cprioritizes core services\u201d including clean and safe streets.\n\u201cWe are not simply going to do everything we were doing a little less well,\u201d Lurie told the Business Times. \u201cTogether as a city, we are going to decide what we want to prioritize and deliver world-class services.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A new $160 million student housing complex is rising near Texas A&amp;M University, an example of how developers are still pushing upscale housing near major campuses, even as enrollment growth begins to level off.\nSt. Louis-based Subtext broke ground on Verve College Station, a 21-story tower at 311 Stasney Street in College Station, about a block and a half from campus. The project will offer 1,193 beds across 392 units, along with more than 37,000 square feet of amenities, positioning it among the largest and most amenity heavy student housing projects in the College Station market, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe building was\nregistered\nin May with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation with an estimated $160 million price tag, though that cost is subject to change. The building will total about 825,000 square feet according to the filing.\nThe development fits squarely into the wave of \u201celevated\u201d student housing\ntransforming\nthe area around Northgate. It joins\nprojects\nlike the $86 million Rev Northgate and Aspire A&amp;M, a 19-story, 873-unit building under construction nearby, as developers chase higher rents from students willing to pay for proximity and luxury.\nVerve will offer floor plans ranging from studios to five-bedroom apartments, with finishes more typical of luxury\nmultifamily\nprojects than traditional student housing. Units are slated to include hardwood-style flooring, quartz countertops, designer lighting and tile, stainless steel appliances and 65-inch wall-mounted TVs, according to the publication. The project also includes 930 parking spaces, a notable amenity in a\ndense campus adjacent\nlocation.\nPlans call for roughly 21,000 square feet of indoor amenity space, including a fitness center, yoga studio, sauna and meditation rooms, game lounge and an indoor-outdoor bar and kitchen. The project will also have a lobby coffee shop and mini-market.\nHoar Construction\u2019s Houston office is serving as general contractor. ESG Architecture &amp; Design of Minneapolis is the architect, with Houston-based Quiddity handling civil engineering. Power Design and Kilgore Multifamily are leading mechanical, electrical and plumbing work, with SK&amp;A Structural Engineers on the structural design.\nThe project is expected to open in summer 2028. Verve will join Subtext\u2019s Ever College Station, a seven-story student housing project at 401 Stasney Street now under construction and slated for completion in 2027.\nTexas A&amp;M hit a record enrollment of 72,289 students in fall of last year, up nearly 20 percent since 2016, according to the outlet. But after years of rapid growth, the university has said it will pause undergraduate enrollment expansion for several years, giving infrastructure and staffing time to catch up \u2014 even as developers continue to bet on high-end beds close to campus.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

An LLC tied to Greek businessman and Libra Group founder\nGeorge Logothetis\npaid $28 million for a 5,400-square-foot pad with six bedrooms, five full bathrooms and two half bathrooms. The deal works out to about $5,300 per square foot.\nLogothetis recently sold the former Rockefeller townhouse\nat 13 East 94th Street \u2014 which appears on a mortgage related to the most recent purchase \u2014 for $15.5 million.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe top commercial real estate transaction was with SL Green Realty Corp., whose acquisition of the Park Avenue Tower at\n65 East 55th Street\nin the Plaza District for $730 million hit records. The seller was Blackstone, which had bought the building in 2014 for $750 million. The Class-A office property stands 36 stories tall and measures nearly 622,000 square feet. SL Green financed the deal with a new $480 million CMBS loan.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nIn the West Village, a condo at\n150 Charles Street\nchanged hands for $16.3 million. The buyer was\nMoon Shadow New York LLC\n. The seller,\nCharles 14B LLC\n, had purchased the unit in 2016 for $14.5 million, or about $4,300 per square foot. The 3,400-square-foot pad has four bedrooms, four and a half baths and direct elevator access. The unit has been on and off the market since 2024, when its initial asking price was about $19.8 million. Douglas Elliman\u2019s\nRaphael De Niro\nand\nJames Flowers\nhad the listing.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nAn LLC tied to a Texas-based ophthalmologist,\nDr. Maurice Syrquin\n, shed a combined condo at the Trump Tower at\n721 Fifth Avenue\nin Midtown for $8.2 million. The LLC had acquired three units in 2021 for $6.2 million, then sold one of the units in 2023 for just under $2 million. The new owner of the combined pad is\nWTMNYC LLC.\nThe unit spans 2,600 square feet and has three bedrooms and three and a half bathrooms.\nRana Williams\nwith Keller Williams represented the seller. The transaction works out to about $3,200 per square foot.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nInvestor\nMo Kofman\nand his wife, interior designer\nHilary Koyfman,\nsold a co-op at\n200 Hicks Street\nin Brooklyn Heights for $7.5 million, or $2,500 per square foot.

        "content": "In November, New York City agent Mike Fabbri was fed up with an expensive, deal-stalling problem.\nOver the past 18 months, six of his pending transactions had been held up thanks to open permits for past renovation work filed with the Department of Buildings.\nHome renovations typically require permits \u2014 and once the work is done, those permits must be formally closed out. But when that step gets missed, the open permit can resurface late in the sales process, often in a title report, and bring a deal to a standstill as neither side wants to absorb the liability. Closing the permit could mean hiring architects, electricians and inspectors and filing fresh paperwork with the DOB, which can cost thousands of dollars.\nFabbri had run into this issue this many times that he\u2019d decided to add an agent who specializes in closing these permits to his team.\n\u201cOne deal I did this summer, we had to agree to put a certain amount in escrow for them to close,\u201d Fabbri said. \u201cThe permit is still not closed out, so money is just sitting there.\u201d\nFabbri wasn\u2019t sure why this had become more common in the last year, but he had a few theories, namely that Covid-era slowdowns and construction halts had disrupted the process. Some sellers may have filed permits for work that ultimately didn\u2019t get done due to a law passed in the spring of 2020\nbanning non-essential construction\n.\nBut that explanation didn\u2019t account for every situation he\u2019d encountered. Some of the permits dated back to previous owners, not the sellers he was representing.\nIssues with open permits have \u201cdefinitely picked up, but they\u2019ve always been out there,\u201d said Shaun Pappas, a real estate attorney with Starr Associates. \u201cAs a sellers\u2019 lawyer, I usually push back on it, and [the hurdle] goes away. But buyers have been more adamant about it recently.\u201d\nThere are no easy solutions to dealing with open permits, Pappas said, especially because they often require convincing plumbers, electricians or other professionals to sign off on work they didn\u2019t complete themselves. But \u201cit\u2019s rare that this becomes an issue that we can\u2019t work around.\u201d\nHe added that for buyers and sellers, it usually means one side has to absorb a risk, one that lenders and title companies also have to adjust to.\n\u201cOne of my clients bought a house and didn\u2019t realize the electrical work permit wasn\u2019t closed and had to open up a wall to fix an electrical socket,\u201d said Compass\u2019 Tali Berzak, who added that the process cost the buyer about $25,000\nBerzak said that one reason the problem might be coming up more often is because lenders are more scrupulous in their evaluations of prospective borrowers.\nAdam Maiser, who Fabbri added to his team, pointed to the DOB\u2019s\ntransition to its new records platform\n, DOB Now, a process that began in 2016 and has since mostly concluded.\nPermit records have been publicly available online since the early 2000s, first through the DOB\u2019s legacy system and later through DOB Now. But the transition wasn\u2019t immediate: permits were migrated in batches, leaving gaps where some records didn\u2019t immediately appear in the new system. As a result, title companies may have checked one database but not the other, missing open permits during an earlier sale, only for them to surface years later when the property was back on the market.\nThere doesn\u2019t appear to be a short answer for why some agents might be running into open permits more often, and it\u2019s likely a combination of Covid-era disruptions, tougher lender scrutiny and long-buried paperwork.\nHave you seen this hold up deals?

        "content": "The Real Estate Board of New York\u2019s annual gala felt like 2016 again.\nIndustry leaders and politicos gathered at the Waldorf Astoria New York on Thursday for the trade group\u2019s annual event, which this year harkened back to a bygone era of real estate hobnobbing.\nDubbed the Liar\u2019s Ball, the 130th edition of the gala carried a nostalgic flair reminiscent of its pre-Covid iterations, resembling what one\nThe Real Deal\nreporter described as an \u201cexpensive prom.\u201d (Compass agent Jason Haber actually did have his high school prom in the same room, according to a post on his Instagram account.)\nThe palatial ballroom, chandelier-adorned rooms and a packed cocktail hour recalled a grander time, before the event took on a more casual air during its years at the Glasshouse.\nThough the gala appeared more formal than in recent years, it wasn\u2019t a total return to the decorum of circa 2016, when the dress code was black-tie. (This year, it was black-tie optional, though most guests wore cocktail attire.)\nAlso unlike 2016, the Mayor of New York City was not in attendance. That wasn\u2019t a surprise, considering newly-inaugurated Zohran Mamdani spent last year\u2019s gala\nprotesting with tenant groups\noutside the venue.\nHowever, in his stead, the mayor sent his housing czar, Leila Bozorg, and Department of Buildings Commissioner Ahmed Tigani, signaling his administration might be more open to working with the industry despite some\ncontroversial moves\nduring Mamdani\u2019s first week in office, including instituting \u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings.\nCourtesy of Johnny Wolf Studio and Jill Lotenberg for REBNYtook the stage following REBNY President Jim Whelan. Other political bigwigs in attendance included City Council Speaker Julie Menin, New York State Attorney General Letitia James and City Comptroller Mark Levine.\nFrom the industry side, REBNY chairman and Two Trees Management principal Jed Walentas was at the event, along with the Soloviev Group\u2019s Michael Hershman and eponymous brokerage founder Ryan Serhant.\nWhile the event was certainly different from its last showing, one thing remained the same \u2014 by the time the clock hit double digits, gala goers had already cleared out.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nEarlier this week, President Donald Trump signed an executive order limiting institutional investors\u2019 purchases of single-family homes. But in New York, investors are already spending less money, and those who are purchasing are paying\nmore than the median home price\n. Will restrictions on investors make a dent in New York\u2019s market? Send thoughts to\nsheridan.wall@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nThe biggest snowstorm in New York City history \u2014 or at least, the largest since the mid-1800s \u2014 was in January 2016, according to data from the\nNational Weather Service\n. Roughly 28 inches of snow fell in Central Park over a three-day period, surpassing a snowstorm 10 years prior, which yielded just under 27 inches of snow.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014\nGov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency across all of New York state ahead of a snowstorm expected to sweep across the East Coast this weekend, according to\nCBS New York.\nThe storm is projected to bring 6 to 12 inches of snow to New York City and its suburbs between Sunday and Monday.\n\u2014 New York City nurses agreed to return to negotiations with area hospitals on Thursday, following appeals from Hochul and Mamdani, the\nNew York Times\nreported. Roughly 15,000 health care workers, represented by nurses unions, have been on strike since Jan. 12, over concerns about safety, understaffing and compensation.\n\u2014 Nine alleged gang leaders were indicted in Suffolk County, Long Island on Thursday, with the charges ranging from shootings to illegally owned weapons to sex trafficking, according to\nNewsday\n.

        "content": "A state Supreme Court judge on Friday dismissed bribery and other charges against Marcal Group\u2019s Mark Caller, throwing out one of five indictments accusing former Department of Buildings\u2019 Commissioner Eric Ulrich of using position in exchange for various perks.\nJudge Daniel Conviser granted a motion to dismiss the indictment against\nCaller\nand Ulrich, but declined to dismiss the remaining four cases against Ulrich and other defendants.\nThe\n2023 indictment\naccused Caller of selling Ulrich a discounted apartment at his company\u2019s\u00a0 133 Beach 116th Street, in exchange for help on a zoning change Marcal Group needed and expediting inspections at one of his buildings.\nThe judge cites three key reasons for dismissing the Caller case.\nOne is that the grand jury wasn\u2019t presented with an \u201caccurate picture\u201d of Ulrich and Caller\u2019s relationship, the decision states. Ulrich provided lawful assistance to Caller for a number of years, starting when Ulrich was a City Council member. If the grand jury knew this, the decision argues, it would have had to \u201cdraw the implausible conclusion that, after getting benefits from Ulrich for multiple years, Caller then decided to bribe Ulrich to get the same benefits.\u201d\nSecondly, the decision argues that it isn\u2019t clear that Ulrich received a better deal on the apartment than what Caller offered others. And finally, the indictment alleged that bribery took place between December 17, 2021, and March 18, 2022, even though conversations between Caller and Ulrich about the apartment didn\u2019t begin until March 19, 2022, the decision states.\nThe reasons echo arguments made by Caller\u2019s attorney Ben Brafman, who filed a motion to dismiss the indictment\nlast year\n. At the time, Brafman argued that Ulrich had \u201cbeen legally helping Caller for years on his projects without any benefit, payment or remuneration.\u201d\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office said prosecutors \u201crespect\u201d the decision and \u201cwill proceed with the four remaining indictments.\u201d\nUlrich was hit with five\nindictments\nin 2023, accusing him of accepting more than $150,000 in bribes, which took the form of a painting by an apprentice of Salvador Dal\u00ed, Mets season tickets, a custom suit and cash for gambling.\u00a0The remaining cases include bribery, conspiracy and offering a false instrument charges.\nMayor Eric Adams tapped Ulrich, formerly one of the few Republican City Council members, as his DOB commissioner in May 2022. Ulrich resigned six months later after investigators questioned him as part of a probe into illegal gambling. Ulrich has pleaded not guilty to the charge.\n",

Its tenants include\nRetro Fitness\n, Keke\u2019s Breakfast Caf\u00e9, CJ\u2019s Sports Bar &amp; Grill and Good Vets.\nCompleted in 1981, the center spans 70,400 square feet on a 6.3-acre site, according to property records.\nPebb, led by Ian Weiner, bought the shopping center in 2003, then called Delray Commons, and sold it in 2015, the release says. After Topvalco bought it in 2018, Pebb partnered with the firm on Delray Landing in 2021, paying $10.5 million for its stake.\nPebb and Topvalco\u2019s renovations of the retail center included a new fa\u00e7ade and roof, and revamps of the parking, lighting, signage and landscaping.\nPebb, a family-owned firm, is partnering with the Toledano family\u2019s Aventura-based BH Group on\nThe Eclipse\nproject, the redevelopment of the site at 6600 North Military Trail in Boca Raton, formerly known as Office Depot\u2019s headquarters. Pebb and BH are renovating two of the office buildings and, in partnership with the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related Group, are replacing the third office building with a 500-unit apartment project.\nIn other projects, Pebb is partnering with BH and Related on a planned\n33-story\nLive Local Act tower with 521 units along Fort Lauderdale\u2019s waterfront.\nRosner has joined the grocery-anchored retail investment spree playing out in South Florida. In November, two entities tied to Rosner and Carlyle Management partnered with another buyer on the\n$60.5 million\npurchase of a Coral Springs shopping center anchored by Aldi, Hobby Lobby and Petco.\nIn September, San Francisco-based Stockbridge Capital Group dropped\n$118.4 million\nfor the Whole Foods Market-anchored shopping center within the Uptown Boca mixed-use development.\u00a0In Plantation, Core Investment Properties Fund and Miami Beach-based investor James Resnick bought the Publix-anchored Jacaranda Plaza for\n$53 million\n.

The individual price of the property is not known.\nWhile other buildings in the portfolio housed entertainment companies like DreamWorks, the Walt Disney Company and Sony, Pinnacle II has had a rough past few years. Warner Brothers was the only occupant in the building until 2022 when it vacated the site ahead of its lease expiration late that year. Since then, the building has largely been gathering dust, and its net cash flow has been negative since 2023, per Morningstar data cited by CO.\nA new undisclosed tenant is planning to move into Pinnacle II this summer, though the deal is only for approximately 25 percent of the building\u2019s available space.\nSoundstage and creative office owners\nin Greater Los Angeles have been hurting since the 2023 actor and writer strikes that ground film and TV production to a halt. At the same time, productions have fled Los Angeles for cheaper filming locations, though state officials are hopeful for a comeback after beefing up its Film &amp; Television Tax Credit Program incentives to $750 million last year. Earlier this month, Hackman Capital Partners defaulted on $1.1 billion in debt tied to\nRadford Studio Center\n, one of the city\u2019s oldest lots, located a few miles west of Pinnacle II in Studio City.

        "content": "Homeowners on Winnetka\u2019s wealthiest stretch of lakefront properties have had mixed results getting approval for construction after the village tightened development regulations along the bluffs of Lake Michigan.\nDocuments obtained by\nThe Real Deal\nshed more light on the contentious divide between lakefront homeowners and city officials that has spurred a lawsuit seeking to overturn the new rules.\nOf at least 11 permit applications made to the village of Winnetka since February 2024 for work along the so-called steep slope zone, four have been approved. Two homeowners withdrew their applications, and five are still in the review process, in one case more than a year after it was submitted. The village granted one exception to the rules for a new house, but the construction plans have since changed.\nThe village passed the regulations in early 2024 in an effort to protect the bluffs of Lake Michigan from damage and instability because of construction. The rules were largely seen as a reaction to billionaire Justin Ishbia\u2019s sprawling $77 million construction project, where he leveled the bluffs across multiple lakefront lots.\nEven as some plans have been approved, the process has been cumbersome even for minor work, said\nJena Radnay\n, a broker with @properties who sells lakefront homes in Winnetka and has clients who have worked with the bluff regulation.\n\u201cThey are torturing lakefront owners,\u201d Radnay said. \u201cThey are making it as hard as possible to do an improvement.\u201d\nPeter Friedman, Winnetka\u2019s village attorney, said the ordinance has clear requirements, it\u2019s been working well and construction has been continuing under the new law.\n\u201cVillage staff is committed to working with property owners to ensure a smooth and fair process,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cThe village is always open to resident suggestions about how, if necessary, to make the process even more responsive.\u201d\nAfter a court dismissed their initial complaint in October, a group of homeowners\nfiled a new lawsuit\nclaiming the rules were designed to block any construction on the bluffs. The village countered by pointing to exceptions it has granted as proof that the rules are flexible, and arguing plaintiffs can\u2019t claim damages without first exhausting their options.\n\u201cIn order to determine what\u2019s allowed and what\u2019s not allowed, property owners have the opportunity to apply for relief, such as variations and exceptions,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cThe Village Board deliberately included those in the ordinance to provide some flexibility.\u201d\nBut Radnay said the cost involved in applying for permits and seeking exceptions makes it too burdensome for homeowners to attempt. Applicants need to pay architects and engineers to prepare plans before paying application fees, which can reach six figures for major projects.\n\u201cYou could be investing $300,000, $400,000 on a whim, knowing that the chances of getting approved are slim to none,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculously oppressive in terms of why sellers would even want to spend their money.\u201d\nHomeowners and contractors who had submitted plans for bluff construction didn\u2019t return requests for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nHere\u2019s more about the applications that have worked and those that haven\u2019t.\nMixed Results for Plaintiffs\nMichael Rauchman, the owner of 645 Sheridan Road, is the only person who applied for a permit in the restricted area that\u2019s still a party to the lawsuit.\nHe applied to build a new residence for $4 million in February 2024. Review comments from the village directed Rauchman to provide more information about plans to replace a gazebo and install a sewer pipe in the steep slope zone, but it was ultimately approved in October 2024 after four rounds of revisions, documents show.\nRauchman remains a plaintiff in the lawsuit, and the homeowners\u2019 complaint claims his property lost 6,300 square feet of developable land, leading to a $3 million value reduction.\nMandy Day, formerly the owner of 381 Sheridan, applied for repairs to a retaining wall. The lawsuit alleges the village requested more information for the application several times, and rejected her proposal because a proposed walkway repair added a third of an inch to the existing structure.\nDocuments provided by the village show Day applied for a permit for a retaining wall and indicate the application was withdrawn by the homeowner. In its reply to the homeowners\u2019 lawsuit, the village said the denial of Day\u2019s permit was because it didn\u2019t comply with the village code and she did not try to appeal the decisions.\nThe village used Day\u2019s sale to attack the core premise of the homeowners\u2019 lawsuit, that the regulations have destroyed property values. The filing notes that Day purchased the home for $7 million in 2022 and sold it for\n$9.6 million in May 2025\n, a profit of over 36 percent achieved after the regulations were in effect.\nThe other former plaintiff who applied for work in the steep slope zone,\nVijay Kotte\n, got approval to build a $10 million house on his property in 2025, and later withdrew as a plaintiff.\nProjects face long reviews\nWhether or not they were approved, projects in the regulated area have undergone months of review over multiple rounds of application, the documents show.\nAt 1215 Whitebridge Hill Road, owner Yong Park has been working for more than a year to get approval for an extensive engineering overhaul of the property\u2019s fragile cliffside, expected to cost $1 million. The plans include a mechanical tram to transport residents down the bluff, a new boat house, retaining walls, and a private pier extending into Lake Michigan.\nIn review comments, city officials regularly flagged design issues that conflicted with the bluff protection ordinance. The city rejected a proposed design for a retaining wall that had a flat top, on the grounds that it effectively extended the home\u2019s backyard, a violation of the ordinance.\nThe city also blocked a plan to replace a stone terrace on the property with a new terrace, noting that it extended four feet beyond the original footprint.\nFriedman said the village is \u201ccommitted to working with property owners who have projects to review and respond expeditiously to permit requests and submittals.\u201d\nOther proposals received similar comments as homeowners sought approval to build along the lakefront bluffs. Frequently, applications were rejected for adding and backfilling walls that extended the table land of the properties into the bluff zone.\n\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be four meetings to discuss a new pool if it\u2019s in the exact same place,\u201d Radnay said. \u201cThat is a waste of time.\u201d\nVillage granted variation\nThe village granted one variation to the bluff rules but the homeowner scrapped the plan when the adjacent property came up for sale. The village board approved a measure in 2024 allowing the owner of 473 Sheridan Road to build a new home in the same spot as the existing home, about 30 feet from the lake, closer than the 50-foot setback required under the bluff protection ordinance.\nBut the owner, an LLC managed by Robert Delaney, later purchased the adjacent property at 499 Sheridan Road for $5.3 million. After getting approval to combine the two properties, which allowed for an existing deck and gazebo that were outside the required setback area to remain, the owner is no longer seeking an exception for the new house.\nStill, Radnay said that the initial exception was limited and would have constrained what the owner wanted to build.\n\u201cThat is why he had to buy the house in front, so then at that point he could actually build what he wanted,\u201d she said.\n",

        "content": "Texas farm supplier and philanthropist Chaz Neely is auctioning a Central Texas luxury estate \u2014 and hoping to get almost double the price he paid for it a few months ago.\nIn February, Sotheby\u2019s Concierge Auctions will start accepting bids for the home at 8536 Armstrong Road outside of Belton, a town on I-35 about halfway between Austin and Waco, according to a Concierge press release.\nThe 13-acre property includes a stretch of Salado Creek, which the 7,000-square-foot home overlooks. The two-story home has six bedrooms, seven bathrooms, seven fireplaces and an elevator. Designed in a French Provincial style, the home includes coffered ceilings and a shallow dome in copper above the foyer, according to the listing.\nBidding starts on Feb. 13 and ends on Feb. 28 with a live auction at The Biltmore Miami-Coral Gables in Florida. Concierge expects beds to start at about $2 million, according to marketing materials. The company hopes to drive bids up to $6 million, the asking price set by the seller with Kuper Sotheby\u2019s International Realty agent Debbie Stevenson, who has the listing.\nThe previous sellers, H. Barton and Jean Jones, had listed the home for $3.8 million in March, according to Redfin. Once the Jones family hired Stevenson and decided to pursue an auction sale, Concierge opened bids at $2.1 million in June. Neely bought the property at auction in July for just under $3.2 million, according to public records. The final sale set a record for Bell County, Stevenson claimed.\nThe Jones family built the home in 2001, according to county records and Concierge Auctions.\nSince acquiring it last year, Neely has thoroughly updated the home, Stevenson said.\n\u201cWe submitted it for the ModaMiami, which is the premier East Coast global auction platform for Sotheby\u2019s \u2014 they do the really high-end cars at the same time \u2014 and the home was accepted,\u201d Stevenson said.\nRecent high-profile auctions in the state have ended with winning bids well below asking prices. A\nSouthlake mansion\nfetched a $14.2 million final bid last September after listing for $27.5 million, and a\ncastle in Fort Worth\nsold at auction for $6.7 million in December after asking $11.8 million on the market.\nNeely owns San Antonio Steel Company, the country\u2019s largest wholesale supplier of agricultural fencing. A prominent donor, he and his wife Patricia support the\nTexas Public Policy Foundation\n, a conservative think tank based in Austin, and endowed a faculty chair position at\nTexas A&amp;M University\n.\nThe Neelys\u2019 home at 11 Inverness Boulevard in San Antonio is also on the market, asking $7 million with Alison Neely Stone of Engel &amp; Volkers San Antonio.\n",

        "content": "Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts is expanding deeper into the gaming and resort business through a new branding deal with the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, bringing four Choctaw Casino &amp; Resorts properties into its global hotel portfolio.\nThe agreement folds Choctaw Casino &amp; Resort in Durant, Oklahoma \u2014 the tribe\u2019s flagship destination that is 90 miles north of Downtown Dallas\u00a0 \u2014 along with three other Oklahoma casino resorts in\nHochatown\n, Pocola and Grant into Wyndham\u2019s Trademark Collection, according to a company news release. The Choctaw Nation will retain full ownership and management of all four properties, using Wyndham primarily for its distribution and loyalty program rather than as an operator, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nCollectively, the four resorts total nearly 2,000 rooms and will roll out across\nWyndham\u2019s\nbooking channels in the coming weeks. According to the outlet they will also be accessible to members of Wyndham Business, the company\u2019s free-to-join travel program aimed at\ncorporate travelers\nand small businesses.\nThe agreement is part of Wyndham\u2019s strategy of growing through affiliations rather than ground-up development or acquisitions, according to the release. As the world\u2019s largest hotel franchising company by number of properties, Wyndham has increasingly leaned on its Trademark Collection to attract independent and regionally strong hotels looking for branding, marketing and loyalty reach without giving up control.\nWyndham President and CEO\nGeoff Ballotti\nsaid in a statement that the affiliation checks travelers\u2019 boxes in a number of ways, creating distinct experiences.\nThe Choctaw Nation framed the deal as a way to broaden its audience, while keeping its identity intact. Chief Gary Batton said the partnership elevates the guest experience by pairing Choctaw hospitality, culture and entertainment with Wyndham\u2019s global recognition and loyalty ecosystem.\nThe move also highlights the continued evolution of tribal gaming real estate, as casino operators increasingly look beyond gaming floors to destination-style resorts that compete for leisure travelers on a national scale.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "As per annual tradition, the biggest names in New York\u2019s real estate industry gathered on Thursday night to celebrate their own and talk business. Our\nprimer\ndives into the specifics that emerged from the event, but here are a few brief takeaways from the annual gala.\n1. Mamdani skipped, but his team showed up\nMayor Zohran Mamdani was the headliner who never arrived. REBNY invited the mayor to its annual gala at the Waldorf Astoria New York, but he declined, continuing a chilly relationship with the trade group he once picketed as an Assemblymember.\nStill, the absence wasn\u2019t total. Deputy Mayor for Housing and Planning Leila Bozorg and Buildings Commissioner Ahmed Tigani both attended, signaling that City Hall isn\u2019t boycotting the industry outright, even if the mayor himself isn\u2019t ready to clink glasses. REBNY President Jim Whelan framed their presence as a bridge, saying the group looked forward to hosting Mamdani in the future.\n2. Hochul leaned hard into her role as real estate\u2019s Albany ally\nGovernor Kathy Hochul once again took the stage, using the gala to reinforce her pitch as a pro-development partner.\nShe pledged to keep working with the industry to \u201cbreak down barriers\u201d to construction with environmental review reform front and center in her State of the State agenda. She further complained about red tape that sends projects \u201cthrough hell and back.\u201d\nWith a reelection campaign underway, the message was clear: Albany, at least for now, wants builders on its side.\n3. The gala doubled as a political temperature check\nThe guest list underscored the event\u2019s role as a barometer for real estate\u2019s standing at City Hall and beyond.\nElected officials spotted included Attorney General Letitia James, Comptroller Mark Levine, Council Speaker Julie Menin and a long roster of city and state lawmakers. Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, a Republican challenger to Hochul, also made the rounds.\nThe mix suggested the industry remains politically relevant, even as it navigates a more skeptical city administration.\n4. Symbolism mattered as much as speeches\nHeld at the landmarked Waldorf Astoria, fresh off a $2 billion condo conversion, the setting was a reminder of what the industry can pull off. But Mamdani\u2019s empty seat loomed large.\nThe Soloviev Group\u2019s Michael Hershman called it a \u201cmissed opportunity,\u201d reflecting a broader hope that dialogue, not distance, will shape the next chapter between New York\u2019s developers and its new mayor.\nHere are the other headlinesthat popped in New York City real estate news this week.\nGerman investor asking $400M for FiDi\u2019s 140 Broadway\nUnion Investment is selling 140 Broadway, a 1.2 million-square-foot office tower in the Financial District, for an asking price approaching $400 million.\nThe 51-story skyscraper is 73 percent leased. Brown Brothers Harriman is the anchor tenant, occupying roughly 190,000 square feet; Union Investment spent $160 million on building improvements over the last decade.\nCharles Cohen\u2019s 750 Lex auctioned off, returns to lender\nThe office tower at 750 Lexington Avenue went to auction but was returned to the lender after receiving no bids against a minimum price above $161 million.\nThe property\u2019s valuation plummeted from $300 million in 2015 to a recent appraisal of $41 million as financial troubles, including the exit or renegotiation of major tenants like Zara and WeWork, caused occupancy to drop, leading to foreclosure.\nLily Allen, David Harbour find buyer for Carroll Gardens townhouse after breakup\nFormer celebrity couple Lily Allen and David Harbour found a buyer for their brownstone at 381 Union Street in Carroll Gardens, which was listed after Allen released an album detailing the destruction of their relationship.\nThe townhouse\u2019s last asking price was $7.3 million, a drop from the initial nearly $8 million listing price in October. Allen and Harbour bought the late-19th-century brownstone, which includes five bedrooms, three bathrooms, a finished basement gym and a private backyard with a sauna and cold plunge, for $3.4 million in 2021.\nSummit\u2019s deal with Pinnacle, by the numbers\nLast week, Summit Properties won its battle to purchase a portfolio of thousands of New York apartments from Pinnacle Group. Pinnacle put the collection of mostly rent-stabilized units into bankruptcy and held an auction for a buyer. Mayor Zohran Mamdani and groups of tenants tried unsuccessfully to stop the sale.\nCourt documents and disclosures Summit made on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange detailed the numbers behind the deal.\nNew York developers are going small\nResi reporter Jake Indursky dug into the new development market in Manhattan, which is shifting from large-scale towers to smaller, \u201cboutique\u201d buildings (under 40 units), which accounted for 32 percent of units brought to market in the last three years. That\u2019s up from 14 percent previously.\nThe shift is driven by developers facing a lack of available land and risk-averse capital, making smaller projects more financially viable, quicker to sell out and less prone to the protracted carrying costs of high-unit developments.\nBuyers, meanwhile, are increasingly willing to spend top-tier prices on boutique projects, embracing perks like greater privacy and customization over the high-rise views and lavish amenities of larger buildings.\n",

        "content": "I have a proposition for the real estate industry and our fearless leaders. Here\u2019s the situation:\nMayor Zohran Mamdani is looking to spend more money, not less, but the city is projected to finish its fiscal year June 30 some\n$2.2 billion in the red\n. Next year\u2019s gap is $10.4 billion.\nIn Albany, revenue has been strong enough for Gov. Kathy Hochul to start funding a massive child care program without new taxes, but she needs more to ramp it up and pay for other priorities, such as housing.\nWhere will they find the cash?\nOne place could be gambling revenues that for decades have been used to prop up the dying sports of harness and thoroughbred racing.\nSuch a change would face resistance from at least two major real estate figures: SL Green\u2019s\nMarc Holliday\nand GFP Real Estate\u2019s\nJeff Gural\n.\nHolliday, a\nracehorse owner\n, has\nchaired\nthe New York Racing Association\u2019s board of directors for four years. Gural owns three harness racing tracks.\n\u201cThe biggest fear that our industry has is that the states are going to stop subsidizing, using slot machines to subsidize the sport,\u201d Gural acknowledged in an\nop-ed\nwritten by industry critic Noah Shachtman. \u201cWithout that, there is no sport.\u201d\nFolks like these have political pull; the writer noted that Holliday threw a fundraiser for Hochul at the Saratoga Race Course. But it\u2019s hard to square their business careers with the use of tax revenue to prop up horse racing.\nGural and Holliday are proud capitalists, as is most everybody in real estate \u2014 which is one reason many industry people\ntried to prevent\nthe election of the Democratic socialist Mamdani.\nYes, horse racing sustains thousands of jobs and still draws fans to its biggest events. But subsidizing child care \u2014 or any number of things, such as repairing aging buildings \u2014 would also create jobs and make people happy. They would probably deliver more bang for the buck, too.\nSome investors are profiting from horseracing subsidies, but grandstands are\nroutinely empty\n. The public has moved on.\nLots of once-thriving industries have\nwithered\nas people\u2019s interests have changed. We don\u2019t subsidize bowling alleys for the sake of nostalgia and job preservation. Why horse racing? Its workers are often poorly paid and badly treated and its athletes are frequently\ninjured\nor\nkilled\n.\nShachtman makes a strong case for letting the industry fend for itself, as we have done for so many others. Dog racing, once active in 18 states, is down to just one, West Virginia. No governments stepped in to save Blockbuster Video, the Yellow Pages or television repair shops.\nReal estate makes money, powers the economy and improves Americans\u2019 lives by\nredeveloping outdated venues\ninto useful ones. Gural and Holliday are doing that right now with the\nFlatiron Building\nand\n750 Third Avenue\n, respectively.\nIf subsidies for horse racing ceased, tracks that failed to survive on their own would be repurposed by developers. Lots of people would profit from the work and the casino revenue being diverted to racing would go somewhere more important.\nI hear there\u2019s a housing shortage.\n",

        "content": "For years, data centers were the quiet asset class \u2014 windowless boxes built on the periphery, generating substantial tax revenue with minimal traffic and zero school-age children to burden local districts. Approving them was often a rubber stamp for municipalities.\nBut this week, the \u201ccloud\u201d crashed into the reality of the suburban \u201ccrowd\u201d in Chicago\u2019s western suburbs, signaling that the era of easy approvals is officially over.\nThe flashpoint occurred in\nNaperville\n, where the City Council effectively killed a proposal by Karis Critical to build a campus on the city\u2019s northwest side. Despite the promise of tax dollars, a resident revolt over noise, power lines and property values forced the council\u2019s hand. A few miles away in\nLisle\n, the friction was identical, as a public hearing for another data center proposed by Cloud Centers LLC had to be postponed simply because the venue couldn\u2019t hold the number of residents who showed up to voice their concerns.\nThis resistance marks a critical shift for developers. The conversation has moved to the grid. A\nChicago Tribune editorial\nthis month raised sharp questions about how the massive electricity thirst of AI data centers impacts ComEd bills for regular ratepayers. This has handed opposition groups a powerful new talking point, moving the argument from \u201cnot in my backyard\u201d to \u201cnot on my grid.\u201d Developers are no longer just explaining setbacks and screening walls; they are being asked to justify their impact on the regional power supply.\nThe stakes for navigating this new landscape are astronomical. While Naperville and Lisle tap the brakes, the\ncapital floodgates remain open\nnearby. In late 2025, news broke of Amazon\u2019s massive plan for data center campuses in northwest Indiana, including a\nconfirmed site in Hobart\n, with total investment potentially topping $15 billion. Further north in Grayslake,\nT5 Data Centers has been aggressively assembling land\n, spending over $60 million to expand its footprint, and it\u2019s already required significant power from utility ComEd. Although even that project faced scrutiny regarding its proximity to residential neighborhoods.\nThe events in Naperville and Lisle mirror a suburban Chicago trend that began bubbling up late last year, when\nAurora implemented a moratorium on data center developments\nto draft updates to its rules and general suburban pushback began slowing the boom.\nFor developers, the entitlement process for the big tech industrial complex now resembles the battleground of high-rise projects downtown. The remote cornfield sites are gone, and today\u2019s development parcels neighbor subdivisions. To win approval in 2026, data center operators cannot rely solely on the economic argument. They will need to master the art of community relations, clearly articulating the tradeoffs and addressing fears about resources and noise well before the public hearing.\n",

        "content": "The Real Deal\nwrote about two deals this week that tell different but somewhat similar stories about Los Angeles\u2019 office world:\none\ndowntown and\nanother\nin Silicon Beach.\nThe latter, a creative office building in Venice, occupied by technology giant Google and designed by the late Frank Gehry, traded for $39.6 million, or about $500 per square foot. The other, an office tower on Bunker Hill, owned by Brookfield, which has defaulted on more than $500 million of debt tied to the property, could trade for $180 million, or about $130 a square foot, if and when a deal that\u2019s currently in the works closes.\nThere is an obvious difference between downtown and Silicon Beach, not to mention Google and Brookfield. Those are chief among various reasons that one traded for $500 per square foot and the other isn\u2019t close to the $200-per-square foot-mark.\nDowntown L.A.\u2019s office market continues to have serious problems \u2014 deep enough to raise questions about its future as a commercial hub. It\u2019s been bumping along the bottom for enough time to render a bargain price being bandied about for a Class A tower on Bunker HIll is no surprise.\nThe $500-per-square-foot for the iconic Binoculars Building does give pause, however, as a reminder that Southern California is still working out its new normal. Industry players estimate the property probably would have traded for $1,000 per square foot before the pandemic, and its current price reveals a reset through the lens of (pun intended) one of the best-known creative office spaces in once desirable areas such as Silicon Beach.\nBack in downtown, commercial giant Brookfield, mostly via lenders or receivers, still has other office tower\nofferings\nthroughout downtown\u2019s Financial District that accounts for about a fifth of Class A office space. Keep an eye on that lineup as it sells off in deals that could set a firm bottom for the market.\nMeanwhile, here\u2019s a recap of key details on the recent trade in Silicon Beach and pending deal on Bunker Hill.\nSilicon Beach trade: The Luzzatto Company purchased the three-story, 79,000-square-foot property at 340 Main Street, where a pair of 45-foot-tall binoculars stands, from a W.P. Carey spin-off. Luzzatto received a $24 million loan. The city transfer tax, which includes a special tax via Measure ULA, amounted to more than $2 million.\nDowntown deal talk: 601W is in talks to purchase the mortgage loan on 333 South Grand Avenue, which encompasses Wells Fargo Center \u2014 North Tower and the retail spot connected to it, owned by Brookfield, for $180 million, knowledgeable sources said. The deal has not closed, according to an informed source. It appears to be lender-facilitated, and the buyer could then do a deed in lieu of foreclosure.\nSome studio solace\nHudson Pacific Properties, Vornado Realty Trust and Blackstone \u2014 AKA the joint venture partners behind just-opened Sunset Pier 94 Studios \u2014 recently announced a paramount\ntenant\n\u2026 literally. Paramount Television Studios leased 70,000 square feet to film the second season of\nDexter: Resurrection.\nThat\u2019s 30 percent of the 232,000 square feet of leasable stages, production support space and offices. A strong start for the new space, and relative boom compared with Blackstone and Hudson Pacific Properties\u2019 Sunset Glenoaks, which is only 8 percent leased, and was\ndeconsolidated\nby Victor Coleman\u2019s Los Angeles-based real estate investment trust.\nSeparately, an $87 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan secured by an office building in Burbank and owned by Blackstone and Worthe Real Estate Group moved to special servicing for imminent monetary default, Bisnow\nreported\n, citing Morningstar data. Its sole tenant, Warner Bros., vacated and it has sat empty since.\nFly away\nThe $45 million debt on a Marriott-branded hotel, a half a mile away from LAX\u2019s entrance, moved to special servicing for imminent monetary default, according to Morningstar. The hotel, at 5933 West Century Boulevard, appears to be owned by Seaview Investors, which lists the real estate as part of its portfolio online. Seaview\u2019s chief executive Robert Alter is the named loan sponsor, per Morningstar. Servicer commentary via Morningstar only indicates that the special servicer, Rialto Capital Advisors, is reaching out to the borrower. Seaview did not respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "Last week,\nRick Caruso\nsaid \u201cno\u201d to a political run. This week, the why became a bit clearer.\nAs the developer shook hands and spoke to a crowd sitting by an empty residential lot on La Fiesta Avenue in Altadena on Thursday, he uttered the word \u201cprivate\u201d four times in less than three-and-a-half minutes \u2014 as in \u201cprivate sector\u201d and \u201cprivate individuals.\u201d\nThe purpose of the gathering on the residential street was to watch a 950-square-foot, factory-built home by\nSamara\n\u2014 the modular home outfit started by Airbnb founder Joe Gebbia \u2014 being dropped by crane and installed onto the lot to replace the property burned down by last year\u2019s Eaton Fire.\n\u201cA little over a year ago, it was clear to me that we had to have private enterprise, private individuals, jump into action and help the city, the county and the state, so Steadfast was formed,\u201d Caruso told the crowd.\nThe Caruso-founded non-profit is steered by a consortium of executives hailing from real estate, technology, finance and other industries to help expedite wildfire rebuilding.\nSteadfast and Samara teamed to start a program, giving modular homes to qualified homeowners who lost their homes from the fires. After Friday\u2019s installation, eight other families are in line for Samara-built homes.\n\u201cThis is what the private sector can do,\u201d Caruso said, motioning to the work Steadfast and Samara are doing.\nWhen the developer confirmed last week that he would not run for an elected office, part of his consideration was where \u201cI can make the greatest impact.\u201d His comments this week, and the tangible result of a family standing before what will be their new home in a matter of weeks, help fill in the picture.\nMismanaged funds\nSpeaking of local government, news broke Friday that Alexander Soofer was arrested by federal prosecutors. The Westwood resident is being charged with taking $23 million in public funds earmarked for homelessness programs.\nSoofer is the CEO of Abundant Blessings, a nonprofit that holds contracts with the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, an agency jointly funded by the county and city to coordinate social services and housing.\nThe federal criminal complaint alleges Soofer funneled some of the money toward a $7 million Westwood home, a $125,000 Range Rover, private school for his kids and other personal luxuries.\nLos Angeles Councilwoman Monica Rodriguez slammed LAHSA on Friday, asserting the agency \u201chas repeatedly failed to provide the basic oversight or accountability required for public resources.\u201d She called the charges against Soofer \u201cyet another example of the enormous resources that have been wasted while people remain unhoused and without help.\u201d\nGetting real on pricing\nYou might have missed the most recent\nprice cut\nfor the spec mansion called \u201cLa Fin\u201d in Bel-Air\u2014and you\u2019d be forgiven if you had. It was the fifth cut since 2022 when 1200 Bel Air Road went on the market for $139 million.\nThe latest asking price is just under $100 million, which Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California founder and CEO Aaron Kirman said represented a more \u201cpragmatic luxury market.\u201d\nIn other words, sellers are coming to terms with what buyers are willing to pay.\nThat opens the door to the question of whether the market sees a repeat of last year\u2019s trend of mansions closing below their original ask.\nIf the roughly 105,000-square-foot mega mansion\u2019s price cut and the thinking behind it from several of its listing agents (there\u2019s a team of seven hailing from four brokerages) is any indication, that would seem to be the case.\nCarolwood\u2019s latest play\nIn business, growth is a balancing act.\nIt\u2019s weighed against the need to generate more revenue to pay for additional talent or other resources, with factors that can\u2019t always be quantified, such as brand equity.\nCarolwood Estates\nseems to be striking the balance.\nAs the brokerage continues to grow its share of the local market, it\u2019s still found ways to expand its customer base geographically without losing its Beverly Hills boutique branding as seen with this past week\u2019s announcement of a partnership with Knight Frank.\nThe deal with the London real estate firm opens the buyer and seller pool for Carolwood. It now has the ability to market overseas to buyers looking for West Coast trophy properties or show existing clients a growing reach.\n",

When residents of Lurin\u2019s\nMadison, Alabama property the Sutton\nstarted to feel the effects of their landlord\u2019s collapse \u2014 these folks had been without water for more than a week after Lurin stopped paying utilities bills \u2014 NBC\u2019s Huntsville affiliate WAFF picked up the story.\nReporter Nick Balenger has been on the \u201cSutton Saga\u201d beat, depicting substandard living conditions at the Sutton and detailing tenants\u2019 efforts to get them fixed. In trying to get answers on their behalf, he found the same thing I did: a company refusing to publicly answer for the harm it\u2019s causing.\nBalenger reached out to chat about my reporting and asked me to contribute to a\nsegment\non the situation. We talked Tuesday, and Balenger wove our interview into a piece that includes his on-the-ground reporting from the properties. I explained that Lurin\u2019s breakdown is an example of multifamily syndicators going sideways when interest rates rose but that this story is unique for the accusations of fraud coming from lenders and former employees.\nAL.com\nand Huntsville\u2019s CBS affiliate\nWHNT\nhave also been covering the situation in Madison County. In the last week, local water provider Madison Utilities closed Lurin\u2019s account after it accumulated\n$30,000 in unpaid bills\n. The city of Madison declared the Sutton a public nuisance, which requires tenants to leave the property. The city has been working to help displaced residents, including partnering with local homelessness nonprofit ShowerUp Huntsville to provide shower and laundry services.\nLurin hit with five more foreclosures\nMeanwhile, Lurin Capital\u2019s legal challenges from lenders keep coming. In the latest spate of lawsuits,\nFannie Mac accused Lurin\nof defaulting on $59.4 million tied to five Pensacola, Florida, properties. Lurin borrowed nearly $60 million in January 2024 and stopped making payments in October 2025, Fannie Mae claims.\nThe lender also accuses Lurin of neglecting the properties and allowing liens to pile up against them.\nThe government-sponsored lender\u00a0 is asking the court to foreclose on the properties and demand payment of the unpaid principal on the loans, interest and attorneys\u2019 fees.\nThe suits mark the second state in which Fannie Mae has sued Lurin. It claimed in a Nov. 6 Texas District Court filing that the firm\ndefaulted on a $77.2 million loan\ntied to Latitude 2976, a 734-unit Houston apartment complex at 201 and 301 Wilcrest Drive.\nMegatel\u2019s foray into cryptocurrency\nWhat do Kanye West, Barron Trump and Dallas-based homebuilder Megatel have in common? They\u2019ve all launched crypto tokens. Megatel co-founders Zach and Aaron Ipour announced the launch of\nMegPrime\nafter receiving a \u201cno-action\u201d letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company is marketing the token as a payment and rewards tool, rather than an investment. Using MegPrime on average purchases will allow token users to earn rebates, discounted gift cards and points redeemable for housing-related benefits.\nMaves narrow down site search\nDallas\u2019 NBA team dreams of playing in a new arena by 2031, meaning it has five years to develop its new home. The Mavs are planning to ditch American Airlines Center in Victory Plaza but appear to be making good on the promise to stay in the city. CEO Rick Welts told the Dallas Morning News that the team has been working with city officials and\nnarrowed down the search to two locations\n: North Dallas\u2019 Valley View site, once home to a regional mall, or Downtown Dallas. A downtown site could involve the land under City Hall, but that option of course hinges on whether the city ultimately preserves or demolishes the I.M. Pei\u2013designed building.\n",

        "content": "Gary Barnett is bulking up again in Midtown.\nThe Extell founder is in contract to buy a prime development site at 405-415 Park Avenue, along with a chunk of air rights from nearby Central Synagogue, according to people familiar with the deal. Barnett is also in negotiations to acquire an adjacent office building at 110 East 55th Street, potentially stitching together what could become one of the most significant new assemblages in Midtown.\nThe Park Avenue sites are controlled by two ownership groups that have been quietly marketing the properties for either a sale or recapitalization. A joint venture between GDS Development and Swedish investor Corem Property Group AB owns\n407\u2013417 Park Avenue\n. Deutsche Bank\u2019s asset management arm and MRP Realty bought\n405 Park Avenue\nin 2016 (it\u2019s unclear if Deutsche Bank or DWS, which was spun out from the bank in 2018, is the current partner). Meanwhile, the Parkoff Organization owns 110 East 55th Street.\nThe sale price was not disclosed, but sellers were seeking north of $500 million. The Park Avenue site, which sits between East 54th and East 55th streets, can support roughly 527,000 square feet of development as-of-right, or as much as 700,000 square feet of rentable office space with additional air rights, according to marketing materials. That does not include the East 55th Street property.\nThe assemblage is steps from JPMorgan Chase\u2019s new 2.5 million-square-foot global headquarters at 270 Park Avenue and near Citadel and Vornado Realty Trust\u2019s planned tower at 350 Park Avenue.\nA Newmark team led by Adam Spies, Marcella Fasulo and Adam Doneger negotiated the assemblage sale. CBRE\u2019s Steve Siegel and a Fried Frank team advised on the air rights deal.\nSpokespeople for Extell, GDS, Corem, MRP Realty, DWS and Parkoff Organization did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Deutsche Bank declined to comment.\nIf the deal closes, it would mark another major Midtown bet for Barnett, who has spent years amassing land and air rights along Park Avenue and in the Plaza District. While the ultimate use of the site is not known, the location and scale suggest a high-end office or mixed-use tower aimed at tenants willing to pay a premium to be near the city\u2019s newest trophy developments.\nExtell is also developing a 29-story office and retail tower at\n570 Fifth Avenue\n, between West 46th and 47th Streets. Extell filed plans for\n655 Madison Avenue\nthat include commercial and office space as part of a taller mixed-use tower, though the primary focus is residential.",

        "content": "Commercial real estate distress in Texas is shifting, as more\nhospitality properties\nhit the foreclosure auction block.\nThe latest major Texas hotel to face foreclosure is Le Meridien Dallas, a boutique hotel in Far North Dallas near the Dallas Galleria mall. The property, at 13402 Noel Road, is owned by NB Holdings, which is run by Aly Nadir Badruddin. The owner allegedly defaulted on the $42.8 million loan tied to the property, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service. Morgan Stanley provided the mortgage in 2019, records show.\nBadruddin\u2019s firm\nbought the property in 2015\n. The 11-story, 258-key hotel was built in 2002 and renovated in 2009 when it became a Le Meridien property.\nThe hotel\u2019s ownership entity filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April 2022. At the time, it had less than 100 creditors, between $50 million and $100 million in assets and between $50 million and $100 million in liabilities.The firm completed the bankruptcy process in March 2024, court filings show.\nThe hotel made headlines in 2016 after\n46-year-old Brian Sample\nwas found killed in a 10th-floor room at Le Meridien Dallas.\nThere\u2019s one other hotel in the Metroplex with the Le Meridien flag,\nLe Meridien Fort Worth Downtown\n, at 811 Commerce Street. Blueprint Hospitality converted a former parking garage into the 188-key hotel.\nThe Stoneleigh\n, at 2927 Maple Avenue in Uptown Dallas, is dropping the Le Meridien brand with the debut of a multimillion-dollar renovation set to be completed this spring. The property, which is owned by Brookfield, will transition to Marriott\u2019s Autograph Collection.\nApartment complexes and office properties have dominated the foreclosure auction block across the Texas Triangle in the last few years. But distress has been shifting to include more hospitality properties. In January, nearly $170 million in loans tied to hotels were flagged for foreclosure in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin, according to Roddy\u2019s Foreclosure Listing Service.\n",

        "content": "The Miami City Commission voted down a proposal to allow affordable housing development on land zoned for religious institutions and other civic uses.\nCommissioner Ralph Rosado called it a \u201cwasted opportunity in what is arguably the least affordable city in the United States of America,\u201d at the Thursday meeting, the Miami Herald\nreported\n.\nRosado proposed the citywide zoning change and was its sole \u201cyes\u201d vote. The city had identified more than 660 properties spanning 1,800 acres that would have been opened up to affordable housing development under the proposed zoning change.\nThe proposal was inspired by a Florida Senate bill passed in 2025 that gives local governments the choice to allow housing development on land owned by religious institutions so long as 10 percent of the units meet affordability requirements. Rosado\u2019s proposal would have required 50 percent of the units built on Miami sites be affordable.\nThis failed effort is part of a growing \u201cYes in God\u2019s backyard\u201d or YIGBY movement to counter NIMBYism by building on church-owned land.\nReligious groups own millions of acres across the U.S., and with church membership and attendance in a decades-long decline, much of it is underutilized. Properties can also prove to be a financial burden. Many orders of nuns have\nturned to selling convents\nas they seek to shore up funds to care for their aging sisters.\nReal estate has seized on the opportunity to snag prime, historic properties. Hoteliers Alex and Sue Glasscock bought a 140-acre estate in Tuxedo Park, New York, from the Sisters Servants of Mary Immaculate for $11 million in 2023. They opened the east coast outpost of their wellness retreat the Ranch Malibu in the 40,000-square-foot mansion that once housed the sisters.\nWhile church land is eaten up across the U.S., it\u2019s a growing phenomenon in South Florida. Tal Levinson and Eric Malinasky are\nplanning a 500-unit residential development\non a former church site in Fort Lauderdale. Billionaire Steve Ross is planning a luxury condominium in West Palm Beach on the waterfront site of\nTemple Israel\n, which will be relocating within the city.\nIn voting down the YIGBY proposal this week, Miami commissioners cited concerns it would incite an open season for historic church properties.\n\u201cI\u2019m not typically this firm on \u2018no,\u2019 but this is a \u2018no\u2019 in every respect for me,\u201d Commissioner Christine King said. \u201cIt is a solid, firm, I\u2019m not crossing the line, I am not bending, modifying. These churches, historic churches \u2014 all they have is their land.\u201d\nKing\u2019s district had the largest share of properties zoned as religious or civic in use in the city, according to the outlet. Her district had 247 of the more than 660 parcels that were identified.\nThis could be \u201cdisastrous for our churches, particularly our historic churches,\u201d she said. \u201cThey do not have the expertise to negotiate deals such as this.\u201d\n\u2013\u2013\nKate Hinsche",

        "content": "The race for office space in San Francisco has put a\u00a0 lead foot on the pedal, and there are few, if any, signs of a slowdown.\nThroughout the year, headlines, analysts\u2019 data, and claims from brokers implied that 2025 was already San Francisco\u2019s get-right year. Then, numbers reported earlier this week from real estate analytics firm Co-Star indicated that leasing in the fourth quarter trumped the rest and kicked into yet another gear. Between October and December, San Francisco\u2019s office market \u2014 for which Co-Star combines San Francisco and San Mateo counties \u2014 notched 2 million square feet of net absorption according to the reports.\nIn San Francisco proper, this momentum helped bring the city\u2019s office vacancy rate down from 34.4 to 32.8 percent, according to CBRE, which also reported that nearly 90 percent of that absorption in the fourth quarter absorption \u2014 and throughout 2025 for that matter \u2014 happened through Class A leases. Yet, CBRE\u2019s report warned, don\u2019t expect the appetite for Class A buildings to eventually energize interest in Class B. Instead, the firm predicts that as high-quality offices get eaten up, it will give way to new construction of ever newer, nicer offices.\nArtificial intelligence has driven the hype, but the burgeoning industry isn\u2019t alone in its search for space. CBRE says companies are actively on the prowl for about 8 million square feet of office, and companies beyond the AI sector account for more than half of the current demand.\nBy all indications, the first quarter of 2026 is off to a similarly fast start. On Friday, Transamerica Pyramid operator SHVO\nannounced that it inked three leases for a total of 25,000 square feet in its own Class A trophy office building.\nSHVO CEO Michael Shvo said one of the leases went for more than $300 per square foot, which for 4,000 square feet works out at $1.2 million per year. Shvo claimed this is not only a San Francisco record, but a West Coast record, and the second highest price-per-square-foot lease in the country. The Real Deal could not independently verify this claim.\nThe leases come on the heels of a busy December, during which SHVO signed on nine tenants for 220,000 square feet. The building, one of San Francisco\u2019s most emblematic, now sits at 85 percent occupied, according to a SHVO spokesperson.\nA tale of two Beaux Arts buildings\nAfter Bay Area-based Kylli defaulted on a $350 million loan in November 2024, the fate of the 22-story office tower at 225 Bush Street that the company used as collateral has sat stuck.\nNow it has begun to wiggle free. Earlier this week, the loan\u2019s special servicer, K-Star Asset Management LLC, is reportedly in discussion with JLL\nabout putting the loan on the market\n. If the debt does indeed go up for sale, the buyer could foreclose on the property or work out a deal with Kylli to take over the building.\nLike many older office buildings in San Francisco \u2014 this one, designed by George W. Kelham for John D. Rockefeller in the 1920s \u2014 225 Bush St.\u2019s fortunes have fallen dramatically since the pandemic. The building went from fully occupied in 2020 to more than 60 percent vacant as of September 2025, according to Morningstar Credit.\nOnly a few blocks away at 685 Market St., Brookfield Office Properties\nhas put up the 10-story Monadnock Building for sale\n. This 1907 Beaux-Arts structure, with nearly 200,000 square feet of office space is 75 percent leased. The anchor tenant, tech platform company Notion Labs Inc, occupies about half the building and has 10 years left on its lease. Brookfield bought the property for $80 million in 2013, and followed it up with a renovation. JLL is brokering the sale, and has not listed a price.\nSan Francisco has operated as a feast or famine market. While leasing is up, few trophy spaces have traded hands and older office properties have cratered in value. One private equity executive told The Real Deal earlier this month that money has been tight for office purchases in the city. Yet, the well-leased Monadnock Building brings something slightly different to the table \u2013 a historic structure with an anchor tenant and\u00a0 some space to lease.\n",

        "content": "A 700-unit Upper East Side apartment tower has taken a steep valuation hit, highlighting the growing financial strain on rent-regulated housing in New York.\nYorkshire Towers, a 21-story white-brick rental building at 305 East 86th Street owned by Meyer Chetrit and Stellar Management, lost about 30 percent of its value over the past four years, according to an appraisal cited by\nCrain\u2019s\n. Morningstar Credit Analytics pegged the combined value of Yorkshire Towers and a smaller nearby property at $678 million, down from $954 million in 2022.\nThe drop comes despite strong demand for market-rate units in the building, which features an indoor pool, 24-hour doorman service and proximity to the Second Avenue Q train. Market rents in the property averaged roughly $5,000 a month in 2022 and now reach nearly $16,000 for top-end apartments, according to StreetEasy.\nThe problem is the other half of the rent roll. About 300 of Yorkshire Towers\u2019 apartments are rent regulated, limiting income growth as operating costs climb. Rents set by the city\u2019s Rent Guidelines Board have lagged increases in insurance, labor and repairs, while the 2019 Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act sharply curtailed owners\u2019 ability to raise rents after vacancies.\nChetrit and Stellar bought Yorkshire Towers and neighboring Lexington Towers about 12 years ago with plans to boost revenue by combining regulated units with market-rate apartments to create larger, higher-rent homes, Fitch Ratings reported. By 2022, only 57 of 311 targeted apartments had been renovated before the 2019 law undercut the strategy.\nFinancial stress followed. In 2024, after the owners failed to make a required reserve fund contribution, the property\u2019s $540 million mortgage was transferred to special servicing. The complex carries roughly $714 million in total debt. Lenders later agreed to\nextend the loan\nto at least 2030.\nChetrit\u2019s attorney, Leo Jacobs, disputed the framing of the valuation drop, telling Crain\u2019s the decline reflects higher interest rates rather than a fundamental cut in value. Stellar did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe situation at Yorkshire Towers mirrors a broader trend. Appraisers and brokers say buildings with heavy concentrations of regulated units are routinely seeing double-digit valuation declines.\nCity officials have also acknowledged the risk: in a recent\nbankruptcy case\ninvolving Pinnacle Group\u2019s rent-stabilized portfolio, the city warned that low rents could make buildings economically unsustainable, leading to deferred maintenance and potential disrepair.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

To see the top multifamily sales in Palmdale in 2025 click\nhere\n.\nChaparral Apartments is a 296-unit property, spanning 18.21 acres with 16 two-story garden-style buildings. At 213,664 square feet, Chaparral Apartments is one of the largest multifamily assets in Palmdale. The property has 72 studios, 164 one-bedroom apartments and 60 two-bedroom pads.\nThe $71 million price for 38441 5th Street West was warranted due to the \u201cquality and location of the asset,\u201d Steven Goldstein of Northmarq\u2019s Los Angeles Multifamily Investment Sales said. He brokered the deal along with Northmarq\u2019s Jeff Benson and Sam Neumark. In addition, Goldstein said, the property is \u201cwell-managed, which allowed the property to command rents higher than the comparable properties while also limiting the initial CapEx needed.\u201d\nAmenities include two swimming pools, three tennis courts, a fitness center, a business center, two laundry facilities, a movie theater and a resident lounge. The property offers parking for 488 vehicles.\nLiberty Equities chose to sell the asset in order to \u201crepatriate the capital to different asset types and move the money back closer to their headquarters in Florida,\u201d Goldstein said.\n",

The total was slightly higher than the\nprevious period\n, which saw 21 luxury homes enter contract.\nUnit No. 11 North will span 3,200 square feet and have five bedrooms and four bathrooms. Plans for the apartment also include 11-foot ceilings and partial views of Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\nThe developers tapped a team with Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, led by Cathy Franklin, to head sales at the project, which is expected to be completed in the fall of 2027. The team began marketing units off of floor plans on Jan. 15 and has so far scored signed contracts for four of the 22 condos. All four of the buyers appear to be local.\nThe building\u2019s planned amenities include doormen, a fitness center, squash court, plunge pool and billiards room.\nThe developers nabbed a\n$195 million loan\nfrom Deutsche Bank and JVP Management in August 2024 to finance the construction of the project \u2014 a $95 million assemblage that the firms put together between 2019 and early 2024.\nThe second most expensive home to land an inked deal was Suite 1 at 240 Riverside Boulevard, with an asking price of $14.4 million.

It also features two terraces, a library and views of the Hudson River.\nThe unit, which last traded for $15.5 million in 2016, hit the market in November 2023 asking $18 million.

        "content": "Oleg Cassini\u2019s former Gramercy Park townhouse has sold for the second time in three years.\nThe late fashion designer\u2019s former home at 135 East 19th Street sold for $7.4 million, according to public records. The home previously traded in a 2022 auction for\n$5 million\n.\nAt one point, the home had been valued near $15 million, close to what the seller initially tried to flip the house for after one year after buying it. The seller lopped off the price by the millions until turning the listing over to Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eleonora Srugo in July, asking $8 million.\nFour months later, the home was in contract. Serhant\u2019s Ryan Serhant brought the buyer, according to StreetEasy.\nThe most recent sales process was markedly less painful than the previous sale, which came after Cassini\u2019s grandson\nsued in an effort to force a sale of the home\nas part of a larger battle over his grandfather\u2019s $55 million estate.\nThe sale comes in the same month that another former Cassini property has also found a buyer amid legal turmoil. Owned by Nestor Cassini\u2019s sister, Peggy Nestor, the 18,000-square-foot home at 15 East 63rd has been tied up in\nbankruptcy proceedings\nfor years as the sisters have\nstymied efforts\nto sell the home, according to court filings.\nBut the trustee overseeing the sale of the home as part of the bankruptcy reported finding a buyer willing to pay\n$34.5 million\nand is seeking court approval to move ahead with the sales process using that offer as a stalking horse bid.\nCassini, who rose to prominence styling celebrities like Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, had secretly married Marianne Nestor Cassini, who many had thought was his business partner until after his death in 2006. In 2018, Nestor Cassini was jailed for six months for failing to comply with court orders in regards to how to distribute her late husband\u2019s estate, of which Cassini\u2019s four grandchildren maintained they were entitled to half.\nThe buyer, who is concealed by a limited liability company, is getting a fixer-upper, which may explain why the home has still sold so far below its previously assessed value.\nBuilt in 17th-century Amsterdam, the home has been taken apart and moved twice: first in 1845 from Europe to the Upper West Side, and then again in 1910, to its current location, where it was reimagined into its Gothic Revival style for sugar magnate Joseph B. Thomas.\nCassini used the home as a party house, hosting salons and some of his A-list clients and romantic interests, like Marilyn Monroe and Grace Kelly, Srugo told the New York Post.\n\u201cSomeone should restore it to its glory,\u201d she said.\nSpanning almost 7,000 square feet and four stories, the home has six bedrooms and five full bathrooms. The first floor, which has a Flemish stone floor at the entrance, features a large living room with a barrel-vaulted ceiling, paneled walls, a stone fireplace and adjacent glass solarium with a stone fountain inside. Every floor has stained-glass windows.\n",

        "content": "The latest bid to give developers a break on Los Angeles\u2019 big, bad\n\u201cmansion tax\u201d\ncomes from a Democratic Socialist, with the progressive president of the Los Angeles City Council seconding the motion.\nFourth District Los Angeles City Councilmember Nithya Raman\u2019s motion to create exemptions to the two-tiered real property tax called\nMeasure United to House L.A.\n\u2014 and commonly known as ULA \u2014 is set to go before the council on Jan. 27. Eighth District colleague Marqueece Harris-Dawson, who serves as president of the 15-seat council, has signed on to support the effort.\nRaman is proposing a ballot measure for June 2 that would create a permanent 15-year carveout for new or \u201csubstantial rehabilitation\u201d of multifamily, commercial and mixed-use projects. The clock on each exemption would start at the time the certificate of occupancy is issued.\nCurrently, ULA applies a 4 percent tax on transactions starting at $5.3 million and it bumps up to 5.5 percent on deals of $10.6 million or more.\nVoters approved Measure ULA in 2022 as a levy aimed at generating revenue to fund housing production and homelessness programs. The real estate industry has argued that the tax, which went into effect in 2023, has chilled financing for new construction and the flow of deals overall.\nRaman has been a supporter of ULA since its inception, and she is casting the proposed care-out as a bid to preserve the tax in the face of steady attempts to roll it back amid a reduced pace of multifamily development that is compounding the local housing crunch. The limited pipeline is increasingly seen as linked to ULA tamping down lending.\n\u201cTo be honest about the conditions that we\u2019re operating in, multifamily and mixed-use housing production has\nslowed\nin the city of L.A.,\u201d she said during Friday\u2019s council meeting. \u201cLenders are pulling back from the market entirely, and there\u2019s multiple efforts to undo ULA entirely, to take it away from us completely.\u201d\nThe specifics around how each asset class is defined in the exemptions are broad. Any property with four or more units would be considered multifamily, while commercial is anything not used for residential.\nRaman\u2019s motion would also address concerns raised by Pacific Palisades owners whose properties were damaged in the\nPalisades Fire\n. It would allow those impacted by a natural disaster to be exempt from paying the ULA tax with proof of \u201chardship.\u201d If this portion of the amendment was passed, it would be made retroactive to January 2025 for Palisades Fire victims.\nRaman\u2019s proposal is significantly broader than an idea floated by Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass in\nOctober\nwhen she called on the council to pass an ordinance that would allow for a one-time ULA exemption over a three-year period for owners of homes, condominiums and other residential properties hit by the Palisades Fire.\nTo date, Measure ULA has generated over $1 billion since it went into effect, according to data from the Los Angeles Housing Department as of the end of last year.\nThe largest share of that revenue \u2014 about 60 percent, or $441.5 million \u2014 came from sales of single-family homes above the $5.3 million floor.\nThat\u2019s across 864 transactions, netting an average of nearly $511,000 per deal.\nThe area that\u2019s generating the largest amount of that single-family revenue is District 11, Los Angeles\u2019 Westside. That includes neighborhoods such as Brentwood, Pacific Palisades and Venice.\nCommercial, which does not include multifamily or mixed-use projects, accounts for the next largest bucket of ULA revenue at $354 million or about 24 percent of the overall pie.\nThis is a developing story.",

        "content": "California homebuyers\ncan\u2019t be duped by property listing photos thanks to a new state law.\nAssembly Bill 723, which took effect Jan. 1,\nrequires\nreal estate agents and brokers to disclose when listing images have been digitally altered and to provide the original, unedited photos to shoppers for side-by-side comparison, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the legislation into law in October.\nThe rule applies broadly, covering images in online listings, brochures and other promotional materials. It also reaches beyond brokerages to photography firms and Multiple Listing Services, which feed listings to portals like\nZillow\nand Redfin. Under the law, the disclosure statement is necessary for \u201calterations that add, remove or change elements in the image, such as interior fixtures, furniture, appliances, flooring, walls, paint color, hardscape, landscape, facade, floor plans and exterior features on or visible from the property such as streetlights, utility poles, views through windows and neighboring properties.\u201d\nBill author Rep. Gail Pellerin, who represents Santa Cruz, drafted the legislation after her former chief of staff drove an hour to a home she was looking to buy only to find that the kitchen featured in the listing photo did not exist, bearing just a range hood and no cabinets, countertops or appliances. The law is one of several ways state legislators are working to regulate the rapidly\ngrowing use of artificial intelligence\n, and follows a similar law passed in Wisconsin in December set to take effect next year.\n\u201cAI has made the barrier to entry very low,\u201d Jeff Klein, managing director of Open Homes Photography, told the Chronicle of the growing practice of \u201cvirtual staging.\u201d The issue lies with generative AI\u2019s tendency to \u201challucinate\u201d images such as views from a room that doesn\u2019t exist.\nThe law does not \u201cestablish a set penalty or fine for failure to disclose,\u201d Pellerin told the Chronicle. \u201cHowever, it would fall on the [California] Department of Real Estate to address any violation per their disciplinary process.\u201d\nThe\nstate\u2019s Department of Real Estate\ncould step in with penalties of its choosing. \u201cDepending on the egregiousness, we could take corrective action, ranging from revoking a license to a slap on the wrist,\u201d Stephen Lerner, the department\u2019s assistant commissioner for legal affairs, said.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Affiliates of Ante, the family office of Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo, are busy making real estate trades across three states.\nAnte spent more than $69 million over the past few months acquiring 186 apartments, according to public records first\nreported\nby CoStar. The buying spree spans Wisconsin, Brooklyn and most recently Chicago, adding another layer to the star\u2019s expanding investments.\nThe latest deal was on Chicago\u2019s North Side. An Ante affiliate paid just over $21 million for\nHarmony Apartments\n, a four-story, 56-unit building at 4513 North Clark Street in Uptown. The property was completed in 2024 by a group of local investors and closed Jan. 7, backed by an $11 million loan from Old National Bank, property records show.\nThe Uptown apartment complex was part of a family feud by its builders in 2024. Chicago builder Michael J. Lerner of MCZ Development and his wife, Jamie Lerner,\nsued their son\n, Michael N. Lerner, accusing him of preparing to sell the property and keep all proceeds for himself, despite previously agreeing to share 50 percent with a trust controlled by his mother.\nEssex Realty Group brokered the sale, with Jordan Gottlieb and Rick Ofman handling the transaction. Essex announced the deal earlier this month, though Antetokounmpo\u2019s involvement was not publicly known at the time. The building\u2019s ground-floor retail space is slated for the Black Ensemble Theater, part of a broader push to establish a new arts and cultural hub in the neighborhood.\nThe Chicago purchase is about 85 miles south of the Bucks\u2019 home arena and just north of the city\u2019s Greektown, a geographic overlap for a player nicknamed \u201cThe Greek Freak.\u201d\nIn November, the\nfamily office\npaid nearly $25.2 million for two neighboring buildings in Prospect Lefferts Gardens in Brooklyn. The properties, known collectively as\nThe Lawrence\nat 111 Clarkson Street and 520 Parkside Avenue, were completed in 2018 and 2019 and total 50 units. The deal immediately fueled speculation that Antetokounmpo could be Knicks-bound, amid chatter that the two-time NBA most valuable player will soon be traded.\nWisconsin has seen similar action. In October, Ante paid $11.75 million for The Atwater, a 39-unit building in Shorewood, completed in 2023 and developed by Pat Connaughton, a former Bucks teammate. A month later, the family office spent another $11.6 million for The Emerson, a 41-unit building in Madison completed in 2021, according to the outlet.\nThe Antetokounmpo family, which includes Giannis\u2019 brother and Bucks teammate Thanasis, has also invested in the Milwaukee Brewers, Nashville SC and online candy retailer Candy Funhouse.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Nahla Capital is suing the seller of the iconic Raleigh property in Miami Beach over a deal involving the use of Peter Marino\u2019s designs.\nNahla Raleigh LLC filed a complaint in New York against BSD Raleigh Trustee LLC last week. In October, BSD Raleigh, a trustee of the Raleigh Land Trust, sold the 3-acre oceanfront assemblage at 1775, 1757 and 1751 Collins Avenue to Nahla\nfor $270 million\n.\nKevin Neuner, Shvo\u2019s CFO, signed the deed on behalf of the seller.\nShvo, the company led by developer Michael Shvo, declined to comment, citing the fact that it is not a party to the lawsuit. It\u2019s unclear who controls the seller LLC following the sale of the property.\nNew York-based Nahla, led by Genghis Hadi, alleged that it\u2019s entitled to receive $10 million that\u2019s in escrow because of the seller\u2019s \u201cfailure to carry through on its promise that buyer would be able to use certain designs by Peter Marino and Peter Marino Architect,\u201d according to the complaint.\nMarino and his firm are not named as defendants. The company did not respond to a request for comment. Hadi of Nahla also did not respond to requests for comment.\nMichael Shvo and his partners planned to redevelop the Raleigh, South Seas and Richmond hotels into a luxury condo and hotel project with a private club, but Shvo failed to hold onto the property. Shvo and his partners, Deutsche Finance America and a consortium of German pension funds,\npaid $243 million\nfor the Raleigh assemblage in 2019 and planned a $1 billion redevelopment.\nA spokesperson for Revetas, the London-based fund manager that was tapped to reposition Deutsche Finance America\u2019s investments, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nShvo and his partners tapped Marino, a New York-based architect known for his leather-clad biker style and his designs of high-end retail stores, to design the Raleigh alongside Kobi Karp of Miami-based Kobi Karp Architecture and Interior Design. Shvo also inked an agreement with Rosewood Hotels &amp; Resorts to brand the planned 17-story, 44-unit condo tower and manage the 60-key hotel.\nShvo had started work on the project by the time it sold in mid-October.\nThe seller \u201crepeatedly emphasized\u201d its partnership with Marino and Marino Architect during negotiations with Nahla, and the LLC agreed to deposit $10 million into escrow, pending an agreement to assign a license for the designs to the buyer, according to the suit. If the LLC failed to obtain consent from Marino within 45 days, the buyer would be entitled to receive the funds in escrow, according to the complaint.\n\u201cSeller further agreed that the Marino consent would \u2018substantially\u2019 be in the form of a certificate and consent attached to the purchase agreement, subject to any \u2018reasonable modifications\u2019 requested by Marino and Marino Architect,\u201d the lawsuit states.\nThat agreement was extended when the seller allegedly failed to make an introduction to Nahla. That introduction was made Dec. 11, with Hadi, Shvo and Marino present.\nBut on Jan. 8, Marino\u2019s attorneys told Nahla that Marino and his firm would only agree to allow Nahla to use its designs if they agreed to the following: that Marino\u2019s firm was not the architect of record, that Marino\u2019s firms make no representation that the designs comply with local laws or regulations, that the buyer use those designs at its own risk, and that the buyer must exclude Marino\u2019s name and the name of his firm, among other requirements.\nNahla responded that it could not agree to the conditions because \u201cthey were materially more restrictive\u201d than what Nahla signed up for in the purchase and sale agreement.\nTwo days before the extended deadline expired, the seller LLC demanded the escrow agent return the $10 million payment, calling Marino\u2019s conditions \u201creasonable.\u201d\nShvo\u2019s sale of the Raleigh development largely marked an exit from Miami Beach for Shvo, who also, along with his partners, planned three office projects in the city.\nLast year, he and his partners sold their\nAlton Road office development site\nvia a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure to Infinity Collective for $28.3 million last year. Shvo also planned to develop a clock tower building on Lincoln Road, but his firm did not end up purchasing the property.\nAnother Shvo affiliate still owns an office development site on Washington Avenue in Miami Beach.\n",

He played a central role in Adams\u2019s 2021 mayoral campaign and served as chief of staff during the mayor\u2019s first year in office before decamping for the private sector.\nAfter leaving City Hall in January 2023, Carone launched Oaktree Solutions, a consulting and lobbying firm that quickly attracted clients across multiple industries. In May 2024, federal prosecutors issued grand jury subpoenas to several of those clients after obtaining the firm\u2019s bank records, according to people with knowledge of the inquiry. The subpoenaed clients spanned a range of businesses, including real estate.\nLater in 2024, investigators appeared to focus more closely on real estate partnerships and other business ventures tied to Carone, one person familiar with the matter told the Times.\nIn a statement, Carone denied wrongdoing, attributing the investigation to political animus and\nresentment over his success. The FBI and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Eastern District of New York declined to comment.\nThe probe also brushes up against Carone\u2019s former law firm, Abrams Fensterman, which has\nbeen linked in civil litigation to sprawling insurance fraud schemes alleged by Geico. Neither Carone nor the firm has been charged with wrongdoing, and both have said they were victims of fraud, not participants.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Celebrity agent Santiago Arana is testing a $65 million price tag for his speculative Brentwood mansion that\u2019s being billed as a wellness retreat.\nThe nine-bedroom, 14-bathroom residence at 401 North Tigertail Road pencils out to $3,250 per square foot on the four-year construction project.\nArana, who is a principal at\nThe Agency\n, also develops high-end homes and partnered with David Herskowitz on the Tigertail listing. The property was purchased in 2021 for $6.9 million before construction began. Arana and Herskowitz enlisted designer Tiffany Harris on the project, which includes a whole wing dedicated to health and wellness with a cold plunge, 100-foot pool, infrared sauna, salon, pilates studio and weightlifting room.\nDubbed Villa Serenique, the 20,000-square-foot home sits behind gates and has parking for more than 10 cars, a theater, bar, wine cellar, soccer field, pickleball court and gardens.\nShould the residence sell at anything close to ask, it would be subject to the upper tier of the\nMeasure United to House L.A. tax\n. The two-tier tax applies a 5.5 percent assessment on trades of $10.6 million or more. Properties starting at $5.3 million are taxed 4 percent.\nThe Tigertail home is in line with many of the properties sold or bought by Arana\u2019s A-list clientele.\nThe cast member of the canceled \u201cBuying Beverly Hills\u201d reality TV show on Netflix was at one time marketing the former property of\nJennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck\nat 2571 Wallingford Drive in Beverly Crest. He\u2019s also worked with LeBron James, Lady Gaga and Larry David.\nArana is upbeat on the high-end market, which he said has been fueled by a number of recent closings near or above the $40 million mark.\n\u201cThat tells me that consumer confidence is back and I\u2019m confident that we are going to have a great 2026,\u201d Arana said.\nThe final day of last year ended with the $35 million closing of 1309 Davies Drive in Beverly Hills. The home, which traded for over $3,804 per square foot, was once owned by singer Ricky Martin and in later years Oscar winner Michael Caine.\nBrentwood\n, where Arana\u2019s latest listing is located, saw its fair share of high-end trades in the latter half of 2025.\nIn October, a property known as\nMelhill Estate\ntraded off market in Brentwood for $53 million. That came on the heels of financier and Milwaukee Brewers minority owner Robert Beyer and his wife selling their Brentwood estate named Ocho Manos at\n11740 Crescenda Street\nfor $44 million.",

        "content": "Eleven years after buying The Streets at Woodfield shopping center, a retail arm of New York-based private equity giant Blackstone took a bruising loss on the suburban plaza.\nBlackstone\u2019s affiliate, Perform Properties, sold The Streets at Woodfield for $69 million to Hartford, Connecticut-based Hutensky Capital Partners last week, after buying it for $168.5 million in early 2015, public records show. The sale of the center at 601 North Martingale Road in Schaumburg comes out to a massive 59 percent discount off Blackstone\u2019s purchase price.\nThe price equates to about $100 per square foot.\nBlackstone took out a $89 million mortgage against the 693,000-square-foot property from Deutsche Bank at the time of the purchase, but later paid it off in full in early 2020, according to public records.\nAbout a year and a half after paying off the Deutsche Bank loan, Blackstone put The Streets at Woodfield on the market, according to prior reporting on the shopping center.\nThe retail plaza suffered from the closure of anchor tenant Carson Pirie Scott. The department store was founded in Chicago and was once prominent throughout the U.S., but closed all its stores after its parent company, The Bon-Ton Stores, filed for bankruptcy in 2018.\nThe 143,000-square-foot Carson\u2019s space at The Streets at Woodfield was ultimately filled by a Restoration Hardware outlet, but at a lower rent, prior reporting indicated.\nThe latest sale is part of a broader shakeup in the retail sector, which has faced upheaval since the growth of online shopping.\nAs of late 2025, retail leasing was down 17 percent, year-over-year, across metro Chicago, according to Matthews Real Estate Services.\nSeveral enclosed suburban shopping malls in the Chicago area\nare in the process of redevelopment plans\nafter facing severe financial distress. That includes a mall owned by another New York-based investor, Feil Organization.\nAfter narrowly avoiding foreclosure, Feil announced an infusion of\n$8 million for renovations\nto the North Riverside Park Mall last February. In the early months of the pandemic, Feil allegedly nearly defaulted on a $75 million note for the property, but secured an extension on its maturity date.\nSmaller scale open-air shopping plazas like The Streets at Woodfield have been faring somewhat better. Some may have been buoyed by\nthe strength of Chicago\u2019s suburban multifamily market\n.\nLate last year, Charlotte-based Barings bought\na 149,200-square-foot Jewel Osco-anchored shopping center in Naperville\nfor $54 million from Buffalo Grove-based Shorewood Development. Shorewood had bought that shopping center, at 1201-1316 South Naper Boulevard, in 2021 for $25.5 million and renovated it, though it\u2019s unclear how much Shorewood invested in the renovations.\nStill, the loss of Carson\u2019s may have been the beginning of the end for Blackstone\u2019s investment in The Streets at Woodfield.\nRepresentatives of Blackstone and Hutensky Capital Partners did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

        "content": "The town of\nPacifica\nis divided \u2014 literally \u2014 over Airbnb and other short-term rentals.\nThe Bay Area community south of San Francisco implemented strict new\nregulations for short-term rentals\nlast year that have already\ndriven away\nmany permitted\nAirbnbs\n, Vrbo properties and other similar vacation rentals, but the rules only applied to inland Pacifica east of Pacific Coast Highway, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\nNow, neighborhoods along the coast are in a holding pattern as the California Coastal Commission mulls approval of the ordinance. The state agency has jurisdiction over the area, leaving neighborhoods like Sharp Park and Pedro Point as short-term rental hotspots in the town.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve basically converted this entire street\u2026 into a row of unregulated hotels,\u201d one local resident told the Chronicle, calling out multiple\nshort-term rentals\nnear her home on Beach Boulevard, including a three-bedroom house owned by a vacation rental company next door. Another Pacifica resident said \u201cit\u2019s like living next to a dive bar and a Holiday Inn.\u201d\nThe California Coastal Commission will consider the matter at its meeting next week. If the agency makes a decision, it will conclude a saga that has dragged on for years as short-term rentals in California face various municipal and state regulations depending on location. Coastal Commission staff have recommended approving the ordinance in a memo last week, despite calling the \u201cstringent\u201d rules that would be \u201csome of the most severe in the coastal zone at this point.\u201d A final vote on the matter is expected by early April, though it could be postponed by up to a year.\nThe strict rules require hosts to prove that a unit is their primary residence and caps unhosted rentals at 60 nights per year, lower than San Francisco\u2019s 90-night cap and San Jose\u2019s 180-night limit. Before the ordinance took effect following city council approval last July, Pacifica had 147 permitted short-term rentals, below the citywide cap of 150. Once the regulations were implemented, nearly half of those permit holders did not renew their credentials, including approximately 23 on the coast and 50 inland, according to a city memo cited by the Chronicle.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Billionaire Michael Dell\u2019s BDT &amp; MSD Partners provided an additional $55 million loan to OKO Group and Cain International for their planned Palm Beach condos.\nThe loan will fund the predevelopment phase of the three-building project planned for 2720 and 2730 South Ocean Boulevard in Palm Beach, a spokesperson confirmed. OKO and Cain bought the 4.9-acre site of the former Ambassador and Edgewater hotels for\n$146.6 million\nin 2022, with a $105 million mortgage from Dell\u2019s MSD Capital.\nDell is the founder and chairman of Dell Technologies. He has an estimated net worth of $132.6 billion. BDT &amp; MSD is led by co-CEOs Byron Trott and Gregg Lemkau. The firm owns the nearby\nBoca Raton Resort\nand a minority stake in the\nAuberge Resorts Collection\n.\nLondon-based Cain is a partnership between Todd Boehly\u2019s Greenwich, Connecticut-based Eldridge Industries and Jonathan Goldstein. OKO is the Miami-based firm led by billionaire Vlad Doronin, who also owns the Aman hospitality empire.\nAfter months of back-and-forth with Palm Beach\u2019s notoriously challenging Architectural Review Commission, OKO and Cain\nreceived approval\nto move forward with their condo development and demolish the former hotels in October. The project is slated to span three five-story buildings totalling 41 units. The developers tapped OMA, the architecture firm led by Pritzker Prize winner Rem Koolhaas, to design the project. Interiors will be by Studio Sofield.\nA representative for the project said it would be Aman-branded at an August meeting, but spokespeople for OKO and Cain have since said the condos will not sport Doronin\u2019s prestige brand.\nPricing has not been released for the project, but sources say unit prices per square foot could top $5,000. That would make it one of the most expensive development projects in Palm Beach County.\nOKO and Cain\u2019s Palm Beach condos will be the first new construction condominium on the island in years. The site is part of a strip of aging condos at the South End of the island, where sources say residents are fielding buyout offers from developers.\u00a0Across the water in West Palm Beach, a similar redevelopment of the waterfront is already underway, with\nthousands of units\nin development along Flagler Drive.",

        "content": "A federal judge dismissed a discrimination and retaliation lawsuit filed by a former\nNational Association of Realtors\nemployee, delivering a legal win for the Chicago and Washington, D.C.-based trade group as it continues to work through years of controversy.\nRoshani Sheth, who worked for NAR\u2019s Realtors Information Group subsidiary for five years ending in 2019, failed to provide \u201cplausible\u201d evidence supporting her claims of gender and national-origin discrimination, U.S. District Judge Georgia Alexakis wrote in a Jan. 13 ruling,\naccording\nto Crain\u2019s.\nAlexakis dismissed three of Sheth\u2019s claims with prejudice, meaning they cannot be refiled. The judge declined to rule on a fourth claim alleging breach of contract, saying it belongs in state court and could not stand on its own after the dismissal of the federal claims.\nSheth filed her lawsuit in September 2024, alleging\nNAR\nretaliated against her after she raised sexual harassment concerns in 2019. Among other claims, she said the organization refused to provide job references after her termination and condoned anonymous text messages from former colleagues that urged her to kill herself.\nThe court found those allegations legally insufficient. On the reference issue, Alexakis wrote that Sheth failed to show NAR\u2019s lack of response to prospective employers was a \u201cdeliberate act of retaliation,\u201d rather than a breakdown in office procedures. On the texts, the judge rejected Sheth\u2019s attempt to link the anonymous messages to\nNAR officials\n, writing that the court \u201cdoes not share Sheth\u2019s belief\u201d that the association had any agency in the conduct.\nAlexakis also pointed to a settlement agreement Sheth signed when she was fired in 2019, which released NAR from claims related to its actions at the time. That agreement, the judge wrote, undercut Sheth\u2019s attempt to frame later events as retaliation tied to her termination.\nSheth\u2019s complaint painted a picture of a toxic workplace, including allegations that a senior executive denied her a promotion after she complained about an outside partner\u2019s alleged sexual advances, and that another leader repeatedly referred to her as an immigrant despite her being born in the Chicago area. Several of the executives named in the suit have since left or retired from NAR.\nThe trade group welcomed the ruling and said it is pleased with the decision in a statement to the outlet, declining further comment. Sheth\u2019s attorney did not respond to requests for comment made by Crain\u2019s.\nThe case landed amid a turbulent period for NAR, which has faced leadership shakeups, sexual harassment allegations, scrutiny over spending, and most significantly, a 2023 jury verdict finding it conspired to keep real estate commissions artificially high. The association has been in turnaround mode under CEO Nykia Wright, who joined after Sheth\u2019s tenure.\nWith the lawsuit\u2019s dismissal,\nNAR\nbecomes the latest Chicago-based real estate institution to put retaliation claims behind it, following the Appraisal Institute\u2019s settlement last year with its former CEO.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "More cash and construction are flowing into Hillwood\u2019s AllianceTexas in Fort Worth, this time with a massive warehouse expansion.\nThe Dallas-based developer is planning an estimated $140 million expansion of an existing shell warehouse building called Alliance Center North 4 at 15301 North Beach Street, according to a plan filed Friday with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. The plan outlines a scope of work that includes a new addition of about 371,160 square feet to the west side of the building, though TDLR filings are preliminary and subject to change.\nThe planned improvements include 55,000-square-feet on two floors, with additional office space \u2014 both open and private \u2014 as well as break rooms and conference space. The addition amounts to more than half the size of the existing warehouse. Built in 2023, Alliance Center North 4\u2019s main area consists of 614,640 square feet, according to the Denton Central Appraisal District, and was appraised at almost $48 million last year.\nConstruction is expected to begin in mid-March and finish before December, the filing shows. GSR Andrade Architects are the design firm for the project.\nA spokesperson for AllianceTexas said Hillwood declined to provide comment on the project.\nThe building is part of\nHillwood\u2019s AllianceTexas\n, a 27,000-acre master-planned development in north Fort Worth. Private developers have invested more than $14 billion in its office, retail and industrial space in the 35 years since the development began, and the development has generated more than 66,000 jobs and an estimated $130 billion economic impact since 1990, according to the Dallas Business Journal.\nThe development\u2019s\nlogistical mix\nof air, rail and highway access continues to find takers for its properties.\nLast year, Wistron InfoComm USA \u2014 a subsidiary of a Taiwanese manufacturing powerhouse partnering with Nvidia to assemble\nnext-generation supercomputers\n\u2014 snapped up two properties in the development. Winstron bought a 324,600-square-foot building at 15200 Heritage Parkway from Trammell Crow Company, which will serve as its primary site with a $580 million investment. It also bought the 767,000-square-foot Westport 14 at 14601 Mobility Way, from Hillwood, where it will spend another $181 million, as previously reported by\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThe complex is also attracting satellite developments looking to cash in on providing nearby housing and entertainment options to AllianceTexas\u2019 workforce. Steve McKeever\u2019s\nNorth City\n, a long-awaited $1 billion mixed-use development spanning over 148 acres in north Fort Worth, is aiming to become an \u201curban village\u201d and a pedestrian-friendly entertainment hub near AllianceTexas. McKeever broke ground recently on two of three planned apartment complexes.\n",

        "content": "The City Council doesn\u2019t have the votes to overturn former Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 veto of the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act, or COPA.\nDemocratic Council members met on Monday to discuss the bill, which Adams vetoed on his final day in office. At the time, the mayor indicated that the bill \u201cunjustifiably\u201d restricted the pool of potential buyers of certain buildings and created \u201csignificant operational and administrative challenges\u201d for city agencies.\nDuring a Democratic conference on Monday, it became clear that not enough members favor overriding the veto. A member who attended the conference told\nThe Real Deal\nthat constitutional issues raised by the city\u2019s Law Department caused some supporters to drop off.\nThe Council needs a supermajority, or 34 votes, to override Adams\u2019 veto and had 30 days to do so.\u00a0Unless the Council drums up more votes before Thursday, the bill will not be put to the floor.\nCOPA would have given city-approved nonprofits, as well as joint ventures between nonprofits and for-profit companies, the first opportunity to purchase certain multifamily buildings that are distressed or have a soon-to-expire affordability requirement. Those approved entities would have also had the chance to match competing bids.\nThe Council\napproved\nCOPA in December with 30 votes. Council member Julie Menin, now speaker, was one of eight members who abstained from the vote\nBefore its passage, the measure was amended to reduce the pool of eligible buildings and shorten the period of time that nonprofits and eligible joint ventures can exclusively vie for properties.\nStill, the changes were not enough to win over industry critics. The measure was vehemently opposed by landlord groups, arguing that it would scare away would-be buyers and slow down sales. After the mayor vetoed the bill, Ann Korchak, board president of Small Property Owners of New York, or SPONY, said the \u201cmisguided law should never have come this close to seeing the light of day.\u201d\nBefore leaving office, Adams also vetoed three bills that set new rules for the kind of housing the city finances. The Council is declining to revive at least one of those measures, which would have set minimum thresholds for the percentage of two- and three-room apartments in city-funded projects. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear where the other bills stood.\nWhen he was running for mayor, Zohran Mamdani said he would help the City Council\napprove\nCOPA. The City Council could still move forward with another version of the bill. Some critics have suggested launching a pilot program to test out the policy.\n",

The seller was an LLC managed by\nFelipe MacLean\n, founder and CEO of Miami-based hospitality developer Yntegra Group, and the buyer was\nAlexandra Balogh.\nThe more than 9,400-square-foot lakefront mansion has seven bedrooms and sits on a 1-acre lot. It has a pool, media room and built-in grill. The seller purchased the property in 2019 for $6.2 million, and it went back up for sale in February.

        "content": "Competition for homes in Chicago\u2019s hottest neighborhoods\ntook off in January\nafter a sleepy December, kicking off an early spring frenzy for limited inventory.\nNeighborhoods like Lakeview, Lincoln Park and Wicker Park are seeing massive demand and bidding wars for premium properties in the first month of the year, according to real estate agents who work in the areas. Conventional wisdom says March and April are Chicago\u2019s busiest months of the year, but the surge has moved earlier this year, as pent-up demand, low inventory and dropping mortgage rates fuel a\nhot seller\u2019s market\n.\n\u201cJanuary is the new April,\u201d said Matt Laricy, managing broker at Americorp and one of\nChicago\u2019s top agents\nin 2025. \u201cBoomer mentality thinks April is the hottest month. [Now,] January and February are the two hottest months in Chicago.\u201d\nTo prove the point, Laricy said he had a listing for a two-bedroom unit in Lakeview at $899,000. The winning offer on the property was $972,000 \u2014 about 8 percent over its asking price.\nIt\u2019s the same story with most well-priced units in the North Side, Laricy said, where receiving 15 offers on a listing is common, and buyers can expect to pay $50,000 to $75,000 over the asking price.\nOwen Duffy, a Fulton Grace agent who specializes in new construction, said his listings went from a couple of people at open houses in December to 20 or more groups coming through in the first weekend of January.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like someone flips a switch, and the first of January comes, and it just goes,\u201d he said.\nTim Sheahan\n, a Compass agent who also specializes in new developments, said he sold out three separate new developments \u2014 with 26 units in total \u2014 in recent days, with most of the contracts coming in January. One 12-unit project in Lincoln Park drew more than 150 people for tours, he said.\n\u201cThis has been absolutely one of the top two or three [Januaries] that I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Sheahan said.\nLess inventory, more buyers\nThe primary driver of the competition is a persistent\nlack of inventory\nin the North Side neighborhoods. Homeowners clinging to 3 percent mortgage rates are staying put, and new construction is hard to come by, Sheahan said. Mortgage rates are about a point lower than they were a year ago, he said, giving people more buying power.\nMeanwhile, new buyers are competing with people who didn\u2019t lock down a property in the fall and are willing to pay a premium, Laricy said.\n\u201cBacklog buyers are buyers who\u2019ve been looking since September, October, and they\u2019ve been waiting for one to come up,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen one pops up, they get nervous and they overpay for it.\u201d\nThe high-stakes environment means buyers need to act fast to lock down homes that go under contract in a matter of days, brokers said. For properties listed this month in Lakeview, Lincoln Park, Bucktown, Wicker Park and nearby neighborhoods, dozens went under contract within a week of being listed, listing services show.\n\u201cEvery property is going to sell in 24 to 48 hours or less. And you get to see them for five minutes, so get used to that,\u201d Laricy said.\nDuffy said he\u2019s had buyers look at units in his developments, then spend a week or two looking at what else is on the market. \u201cWhen they\u2019ve come back, then their units are gone,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not ready to jump on something almost right away, it\u2019s tough. You will lose it.\u201d\nAgents said they don\u2019t expect the level of demand in the North Side neighborhoods to slow down over the spring. With few people moving out of homes with low-interest mortgages, Sheahan said new developments are the main source of new inventory.\n\u201cA lot of the inventory that\u2019s out there is inventory we\u2019ve created by building,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s tough to find building sites, projects take a while, so that \u2026 inventory is a little bit limited. The level of demand is going to remain strong.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A venture of Minneapolis-based Northmarq and Chicago-based developer Bond Companies sold the Kildeer Village Square shopping center for $51 million last week amid a turbulent period in the region\u2019s retail property market.\nHouston-based Fidelis Realty Partners bought the 198,900-square-foot square foot property at 20393 North Rand Road in north suburban Kildeer from Northmarq and Bond in a deal that came out to $256 per square foot, according to public records.\nBond, led by founder and CEO Rob Bond, developed both the Kildeer Village Square Shopping Center and the nearby Kildeer Marketplace. The developer was a minority owner of the Village Square shopping center at time of Fidelis\u2019 purchase, he said. It\u2019s unclear when Northmarq became the majority owner of the shopping center.\nThe Marketplace property, anchored by a Whole Foods Market, was completed in 2012 and the Village Square shopping center, which includes a Nordstrom Rack and a Sierra Trading Post among other tenants, was completed in 2017, according to prior reports.\nBond put both properties on the market in 2019 and said at the time he was open to selling them together, separately or holding onto them.\nThe Marketplace shopping center hasn\u2019t sold.\nThe developer took out a $47.9 million mortgage from Citibank against the Village Square shopping center in 2019, though the total amount the company spent on developing the property is unclear.\nThe buyer, Fidelis, also bought another nearby shopping center, The Shops at Kildeer, for $31 million in the fall of 2025, records show. The seller was a joint venture of New York-based DRA Advisors and Northbrook-based retail investor Pine Tree which had paid $32.8 million for the shopping center in 2018.\nThe transactions come at a time when retail investors are struggling to determine the appropriate value for shopping centers in Chicago and the surrounding area.\nThe rise of online shopping has played a role in decreased vacancy at such shopping centers and led to the redevelopment of\nseveral Chicago area malls\n.\nBlackstone\u2019s affiliate, Perform Properties,\nsold The Streets at Woodfield in Schaumburg\nfor $69 million to Hartford, Connecticut-based Hutensky Capital Partners last week, after buying it for $168.5 million in early 2015. The sale came out to a whopping 59 percent discount or about $100 per square foot. The plaza had struggled since anchor tenant Carson Pirie Scott went out of business and its space was filled by Restoration Hardware Outlet at a lower rent.\nBut the region\u2019s\nstrong multifamily market\nis also boosting retail demand and resulting in decent returns for some sellers.\nIn late 2025, Charlotte-based Barings bought a\n149,200-square-foot Jewel Osco-anchored shopping center\nin Naperville for $54 million from Buffalo Grove-based Shorewood Development. Shorewood had bought that shopping center, at 1201-1316 South Naper Boulevard, in 2021 for $25.5 million and renovated it, though it\u2019s unclear how much Shorewood invested in the renovations.\nEarlier in 2025, Chicago-area investors\nEdward Hassan and Adam Firsel\nsold their Burr Ridge Village Center retail property for $55 million last year, likely a significant return on their 2019 investment of $15 million in the previously distressed suburban Chicago retail property. Their exact return on investment couldn\u2019t be determined, however, as they spent on improving the property, including at least $7 million with a leasing campaign to refill the property.\n",

        "content": "Chicago-based real estate firm R2 picked up a high-vacancy loft property just west of Fulton Market, eyeing a conversion of the building into flexible, small-bay industrial space.\nLast month, R2 paid just over $3 million for the three-story, roughly 49,000-square-foot building at 2130 to 2140 West Fulton Street, according to Cook County property records. CoStar\nreported\nthat the firm rebranded the building as Fulton Lofts and plans to lease it to a mix of creative and light industrial tenants, from furniture studios and art galleries to coffee roasters and podcast operations.\nThe acquisition fits squarely within R2\u2019s growing push into what it calls \u201curban flex\u201d properties \u2014\nolder industrial buildings retooled\nto support a wide range of uses at rents below those commanded by Class A office space. R2 partner Zack Cupkovic told the outlet that the firm wants \u201cto provide urban flex properties with the level of management and service that you\u2019d expect in an office building.\u201d\nThe seller was\nSagard Real Estate\n, formerly known as EverWest Real Estate Investors, which paid $5.1 million for the property in 2017, according to CoStar data and county records. Sagard was represented by a Marcus &amp; Millichap team led by John Abuja and Kyle Hynes, along with Philip Kates, Adam Sklaver and Steven Weinstock. Sagard did not respond to a request for comment from CoStar.\nR2 bought the property out of an auction, financing the deal with a nearly $2.3 million loan from T2 Capital Management. The building is about half vacant and sits near breweries, galleries and other creative users clustered along the western edge of the Kinzie Industrial Corridor.\nR2 recently bet on the\nSalt Shed concert venue\nand a flex conversion on Goose Island that provide examples of what R2 wants to bring to the building, according to the publication.\nThe site\u2019s location \u2014 just north of the\nUnited Center\n\u2014 adds longer-term upside as well. The owners of the Bulls and Blackhawks have floated plans for a $7 billion mixed-use development around the arena, which could further boost demand for nearby workspace.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The vacancy rate for the Bay Area\u2019s 43.3 million square feet of biotech space was 30.2 percent in the fourth quarter, down from a third-quarter vacancy rate of 32.8 percent.\nIt\u2019s part of an ongoing upswing in the regional life sciences market, as the Bay Area led the nation in terms of leasing activity and demand for space in the third quarter, per CBRE. Overall, 14.4 million square feet of life sciences space has been added in the Bay Area since 2020.\nTenants are taking advantage of the glut of space. Earlier this month, University of California, San Francisco Health\nsigned a lease\nfor 280,000 square feet at Kilroy Realty Corporation\u2019s Oyster Point development. UCSF Health plans to move its pharmacy and clinical laboratory groups from their hospital campuses to the new space and open its facilities there in 2029. In San Francisco, biotech firm Nudge\ndoubled\nits footprint to 62,000 square feet in Mission Bay earlier this month, the San Francisco Business Times reported.\nNew developments continue to hit the market, including IQHQ\u2019s delivery of The Shop, its fully pre-leased 226,000-square-foot lab and office space at its Elco Yards site in Redwood City.\nStill, developers have largely\nhalted advancement\nof planned projects while the market continues its apparent recovery. Only two large endeavors converting offices for biotech use remain in the pipeline, according to CBRE. Hesitation could be linked to the Trump administration\u2019s\nslashing of federal funds\nused in the life sciences sphere.\nIQHQ itself looked to\nhit pause\non its $1.3 billion development in South San Francisco as part of its larger planned Spur district, seeking a 10-year extension to transform the 857,000-square-foot site at 800 Dubuque Avenue.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A New York-based real estate investment trust shed a massive downtown Houston office tower at a fraction of its prior value, selling the 1 million-square-foot headquarters building of engineering contractor KBR to Namdar Realty Group.\nNet Lease Office Properties, an externally managed REIT advised by affiliates of\nW.P. Carey\n, sold the building at 601 Jefferson Street for $66 million on Jan. 15, according to a Jan. 20 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. JLL Capital Markets confirmed the deal Monday in a news release, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n. The price equates to roughly $62 per square foot, a steep discount for a 40-story, trophy tower in the city\u2019s central business district.\nHarris County records and industry reports identified\nNamdar Realty Group\nand Mason Asset Management, both based in Great Neck, New York, as the purchasers. The deal also included the adjacent parking garage at 701 Jefferson Street, according to JLL.\nKBR anchors the building, occupying close to 900,000 square feet, or nearly 90 percent of the tower, which is 92 percent leased overall, according to JLL. The 2.94-acre property includes two basement levels in addition to its 40 above-ground floors.\nJLL\u2019s Capital Markets Investment Sales and Advisory team represented the seller, led by managing director Kevin McConn and senior managing director Jeff Hollinden. McConn said in a statement that the building generated \u201ctremendous interest\u201d from private capital sources due to its immediate yield, including several investors new to the Houston market.\nHarris Central Appraisal District records peg the property\u2019s appraised value at $120.4 million as of Jan. 1, underscoring the valuation reset facing downtown office buildings even when backed by long-term corporate tenants.\nThe sale marks a dramatic markdown from the building\u2019s last major trade. A W.P. Carey subsidiary bought the tower, then known as KBR Tower, in 2012 for $174.6 million, meaning the January sale amounts to a 62 percent drop in value.\nW.P. Carey spun off 59 office properties, including the one at 601 Jefferson Street, into Net Lease Office Properties in 2023, as it reduced its exposure to the struggling office sector.\nThe\nNamdar\nacquisition adds another large-format downtown office to its\nportfolio\n.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Without the funds, the firm will have to sell off properties at an estimated 5.5 percent cap rate, meaning investors would lose between 60 percent and 75 percent of their equity, according to\nThe Promote\n.\nWhen S2 secured a lifeline via the REIT, some industry voices found it innovative, like LinkedIn account CRE Analyst, who\nwrote\n, \u201cIf this is what happened, S2 just showed other syndicators how to survive until \u201925.\u201d\nS2 did, indeed, survive until \u201825.

S2\nraised $343 million\nfor its second value-add fund over the summer and acquired industrial operator Fort Capital\u2019s 11 million-square-foot portfolio in August.

Plus, the firm was still left to execute its value-add promise.\nThe same month that S2 closed its second value-add fund, the firm lost a property to foreclosure. It allegedly\ndefaulted on a $36 million mortgage\nfrom CBRE for the 290-unit Preslee Apartments, at 2504 Ivy Brook Court in Arlington.\nEverett launched S2 Capital in 2012.

        "content": "The momentum slowed in Palm Beach County\u2019s luxury market last week, but buyers are still signing pricey contracts as the busy season persists.\nBuyers signed 21 contracts between Jan. 19 and Jan. 25 for luxury properties in Palm Beach County, according to\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s\nEklund-Gomes\nteam. The homes that went pending last week total $132.5 million in asking dollar volume and averaged 93 days on the market. The previous week, buyers\nsigned 40 contracts totaling $324.7 million\n.\nThe report tracks signed contracts for single-family homes and condos asking $3 million or more in the Beaches MLS. It identified 93 new listings, and 1,265 active listings on the market.\nOf the properties that went pending last week, 15 were single-family homes, and six were condos. The average asking price for the condos was $7.9 million, or $2,457 per square foot. They spent an average of 120 days on the market.\nThe average asking price for the single-family homes was $5.7 million, or $1,238 per square foot, and they spent an average of 65 days on the market.\nThe most expensive listing to go into contract last week was unit 1801 at\nthe Bristol\n, at 1100 South Flagler Drive, asking $23.5 million. Records show the seller is Raymond Golden, a former executive with defunct investment bank Salomon Brothers and the CBRE-owned developer Trammell Crow Company. Golden bought the unit with his wife, Linda, in 2018 for $10.4 million, a West Palm Beach price record at the time.\nThe unit spans 5,700 square feet, four bedrooms, four bathrooms and one half-bathroom.\nThey listed the unit for $25.5 million, or $4,474 per square foot, in April, according to Zillow. Samantha Curry with Douglas Elliman has the listing.\nThe next most expensive listing to find a buyer was the compound at 256 and 262 Cordova Road in West Palm Beach\u2019s El Cid neighborhood, asking $12.6 million.\nRecords show the seller is Rebekah Alfond, the founder of Marie Birdie, a golf apparel brand for children and teens. She bought the homes for $8.4 million in a pair of deals in 2021 and 2024. The properties total 0.4 acres with one 1,400-square-foot house and a two-bedroom guest house at 262 Cordova Road and a 3,500-square-foot, five-bedroom house at 256 Cordova Road. The estate also has two pools.\nIt hit the market asking $12.6 million in November, Zillow shows. Simon Isaacs with Simon Isaacs Real Estate had the listing.",

Now, he\u2019s partnering with a major management firm to scale up Public Hotels.\nSchrager joined forces with Highgate to operate his Public brand, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. The partners aim to acquire hotels or small hotel companies, develop properties and convert Highgate assets to the Public banner.\nHighgate, which owns or manages more than 400 properties across the world, won\u2019t be taking an ownership stake in Public. It will be involved in acquisitions and management contracts, though.\nThe hotelier is also dropping his usual pursuit of high-profile restaurant options for his properties, instead opting for fast-casual and takeout food to save on costs.\nDespite launching 15 years ago, Public has only a single hotel in operation, a property at 215 Chrystie Street in Manhattan. Public is talking with Danny Meyer to run a food and beverage service at the location, which was recently refinanced with a $310 million loan.\nThe hotel has been the site of a dispute between Schrager and Whole Foods Market. In July, Whole Foods sued the hotel, claiming the crowd for the trendy rooftop bar blocks overnight deliveries to its East Houston Street location by restricting access to its driveway and loading docks.\nAn entity tied to the hotel\nresponded\nby filing a summons against Whole Foods, seeking to stop its delivery trucks from parking \u201cin front or in the vicinity\u201d of the property.\nSchrager and Steve Witkoff opened the 28-story building in 2017, but were forced to close it after the onset of the pandemic. The hotel reopened in the summer of 2021, but by the next year, the developers had defaulted on their $189 million senior mortgage and faced a UCC foreclosure on their equity in the property, which the refinancing took care of.\nA second hotel is expected to open in West Hollywood in the spring, but that\u2019s still a far cry from the 15 locations Schrager expected to have up and running within seven years of the company\u2019s launch in 2011.\nSchrager rose to fame as a pioneer in the boutique hotel space and was a co-founder of Studio 54. He also helped develop Marriott\u2019s Edition lifestyle hotel brand, a partnership that ended in 2022.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "John Beyer, a preservationist, architect and last surviving co-founder of the firm Beyer Blinder Belle, died last Tuesday at his Manhattan home, the New York Times\nreported\n. He was 92.\nA representative from his eponymous firm confirmed his death. No cause of death was given.\nBeyer, Richard Blinder and John Belle founded the company in 1968 after breaking off from shopping mall pioneer Victor Gruen. The firm staked out a reputation for preserving New York City\u2019s history and adapting old properties into more contemporary uses.\nBorn on Feb. 13, 1933 in Hackensack, New Jersey, Beyer grew up in Teaneck. His father was a jeweler. Beyer studied at Denison University, receiving his degree in art in 1954 before pursuing a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree in architecture at Harvard University, setting him on the course to define a generation of New York City buildings.\nHis firm\u2019s most notable work may have been the restoration of Grand Central Terminal, which it transformed from grungy to glamorous in 1998, cleaning layers of soot, adding a grand staircase and removing a billboard that obscured natural light.\nOther significant renovations included the Met Breuer building, the main New York Public Library property, the Frick Collection and the flagship Henri Bendel store, rebuilt into a Fifth Avenue rowhouse. The firm also operated in Washington, D.C.\nAfter 9/11, Beyer Blinder Belle was commissioned to develop site plans at the World Trade Center, which Beyer took the lead on. The design was deemed underwhelming and the firm was replaced by Studio Daniel Libeskind, but many of the guiding principles pitched by Beyer Blinder Belle ultimately remained.\nThe firm remained one of the city\u2019s\nactive developers\nin recent years and Beyer was a part of that, even after the passing of his co-founders; Blinder died in 2006, while Belle\ndied in 2016\n. The demise of Innovation QNS presented an opportunity for Beyer Blinder Belle, listed as the\narchitect\nof a 560-unit, 498,000-square-foot mixed-use building filed at 35-18 Steinway Street by BedRock and L+M.\nBeyer\u2019s passing comes less than two weeks after the death of his wife. He is survived by two children from his first marriage, three from his second marriage and nine grandchildren.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The suburban Chicago Lyons Township High School District 204 is one step closer to hiring a real estate broker to help sell a chunk of land it owns in Willow Springs, reviving a process that stalled years ago amid public backlash and concerns about backroom dealing.\nAt a board meeting last week, district officials signaled tentative support for MoHall Commercial and Urban Development, the lowest bidder among three firms vying for the assignment, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. The broker would be tasked with valuing the property, marketing it broadly and identifying potential buyers, according to meeting discussions.\nThe district has been in possession of the roughly 70-acre\nundeveloped property\nfor many decades, having acquired it in anticipation of the possible need for an additional campus. According to the district\u2019s website, that need was determined unnecessary years ago due to enrollment projections. The district\u2019s Board of Education wants any profit from a sale to make investments in updating\ncampus facilities\n.\nThe district stopped short of approving a contract, citing unanswered reference checks. Chicago-based MoHall submitted three references as required under the bid request, but only one responded, with the others remaining silent despite repeated follow-ups. Superintendent Brian Waterman told the board he would push the firm to secure additional responses or provide new references before any agreement is finalized. The board expects to make a decision in February.\nMoHall\u2019s proposal came in at $45,000, with no set timeline. CBRE submitted a $90,000 bid tied to a six-month engagement, while Oak Terrace-based\nNAI Hiffman\nproposed a yearlong assignment for $120,000, the publication reported. Board members acknowledged the cost gap, but emphasized that credibility and process would outweigh price alone.\nTransparency has been a recurring theme. Roughly three years ago, the district faced intense opposition after residents learned of quiet talks about a potential sale to an industrial buyer. That episode derailed negotiations and left the land in limbo, according to the outlet. The district rejected two bids from industrial buyers at the time, the highest a $55 million bid from Chicago-based\nBridge Industrial\n, the community newspaper Riverside-Brookfield Landmark\nreported\nat the time. Board members said they intend to work closely with the Willow Springs community and keep discussions in the open this time.\nBoard member Kari Dillon said at the meeting that the selected broker should go beyond passive marketing, listing the property on a multiple listing service and proactively reaching buyers who may not be aware of the site. Vice President Jill Beda Daniels added that the broker will be expected to analyze market conditions and pricing trends, even if that means advising the district to wait.\nStill, the district is feeling financial pressure.

The planned RH complex, plotted as a retail, food, wine, art and design \u201cexperience,\u201d would take up two buildings in Broadway Plaza, including 1401 Mount Diablo Boulevard.\nThe RH Gallery resembles the RH dining complex at Stanford Mall in Palo Alto, which opened in 2024, according to the Mercury News. RH is leasing the closed Neiman Marcus site in Walnut Creek from\nMacerich\n, which owns Broadway Plaza.\nIn total, the new RH complex is expected to encompass 50,000 square feet across two buildings at the former department store, Shelly Dress, general manager of Broadway Plaza, told the Mercury News.\nMacerich planned the forthcoming RH Gallery in downtown Walnut Creek as \u201can inspiring integration of food, wine, art and design with an immersive retail experience,\u201d Douglas Healey, a Macerich senior executive vice president for leasing, said in December 2024 when Macerich first revealed its plans. He called it \u201canother great example of transformational leasing and the repurposing of a vacant anchor store within our portfolio.\u201d The complex is expected to include Mediterranean-style buildings with a \u201cglass atrium garden restaurant surrounded by fireplaces, fountains and an outdoor wine experience.\u201d\nDowntown Walnut Creek\u2019s Neiman Marcus store closed in 2021 after the luxury retail store chain filed for bankruptcy the year prior and has been empty for the past five years since then. The company has since been purchased by Saks Global, which itself filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy\nearlier this month\n. Saks Global\nopted to sell\nthe land beneath the Neiman Marcus store across the Bay in San Francisco\u2019s Union Square earlier this month and\ndid the same in Beverly Hills\nlast month in apparent efforts to stop financial bleeding.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Lily Allen and David Harbour\u2019s\nbreakup townhouse\ntopped the most expensive contracts signed in Brooklyn last week.\nThe deal for the Carroll Gardens home asking $7.3 million was the priciest of 20 contracts \u2014 eight condos, one co-op and 11 houses \u2014 signed from Jan. 20 to Jan. 25\u00a0 for a total contract volume of $69 million, according to Compass\u2019 weekly report of contracts for homes asking at least $2 million.\nLast\nweek\n, Brooklyn\u2019s luxury market saw 10 deals signed for a total contract volume of $33 million.\nAllen and Harbour bought the home for $3.4 million in 2021 and listed it for $8 million on Oct. 26, 2025, two days after Allen released \u201cWest End Girl,\u201d an album detailing the dissolution of her relationship with Harbour. The pair dropped the price to $7.3 million at the start of this year.\nCompass\u2019 Carl Gambino had the listing and Compass\u2019 Todd Lewin brought the buyer.\nThe late 19th-century brownstone spans 22 feet wide and has five bedrooms, three full bathrooms, three fireplaces and a gym in the finished basement. The full-floor primary suite has a fireplace and dual walk-in closets, while the garden level has another guest suite.\nThe private backyard has a sauna and cold plunge.\nThe second priciest contract signed last week was for a Carroll Gardens townhouse at 16 2nd Street asking $5.5 million.\nThe home spent just 14 days on the market, a seeming testament to over two decades of tweaks and renovations that seller, architect James Biber, had undertaken since 2002.\nBiber and his late wife Carin Goldberg, known for designing Madonna\u2019s debut album cover, gut renovated the house, which Biber described as \u201ckind of a wreck\u201d in an interview with\nRobb Report\nabout the work.\nLater, they converted the top floor to an open-plan living space and updated the facade and landscaping of the front and rear gardens. Two more rounds of refreshes took place in 2020 and 2025. \u201cIt is now as nearly perfect as it can be,\u201d Biber said.\nThe work kept intact much of the home\u2019s 1875 character, including pine hardwood floors, window moldings, plaster work and a central staircase, while air rights mean the future owner can expand even further on Biber\u2019s work.\nCorcoran\u2019s Dana Power and Falcon Griffith had the listing.\nThe homes put into contract last week had a median asking price of $3.3 million, spent an average of 181 days on the market and had an average discount of 3 percent.\n",

        "content": "Boxer Oscar De La Hoya defaulted on a $27 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan connected to an office building in downtown Los Angeles that his company owns and occupies. De La Hoya owes about $23 million and faces foreclosure on the property, according to the notice of default and election to sell dated late last year.\nThe Real Deal\npreviously\nreported\nthat the debt landed in special serving after missing a July maturity date. The latest servicer commentary, via Morningstar Credit, notes that the borrower is seeking a loan modification and extension of the maturity date \u2014 and the lender will continue discussions but has called a lawyer.\nThe 12-story, roughly 150,000-square-foot property at 626 Wilshire Boulevard, located in the Financial District, was only 60 percent occupied, according to servicer commentary, as of last summer.\nDowntown offices\n, which have become the poster-child for post-pandemic distress,\u00a0 had a 34.4 percent vacancy rate, as of the fourth quarter last year, per a CBRE report.\nDe La Hoya\u2019s Golden Boy Promotions \u2014 so called for the former boxer, who was nicknamed \u201cThe Golden Boy of Boxing\u201d after he won an Olympic gold medal \u2014 occupies 7 percent of the space, or around 10,500 square feet, and is the second largest tenant in the building. De La Hoya founded the company and is its chief executive and chair.\nDe La Hoya and the\nlate\nBarker Pacific Group founder, Michael Barker, are the named loan sponsors, per Morningstar. The debt originated more than a decade ago, and the value of the property has plummeted since. In 2015, the mid-rise office building on the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Hope Street was worth $40 million \u2014 its 2025 appraisal put its value at $19 million.\nThe Los Angeles Times, in 2004,\nreported\nDe La Hoya\u2019s Golden Boy purchased a controlling interest in the property for $16 million from Barker Pacific Group, which kept a minority share; Christopher Rising of Rising Realty Partners also purchased a minority share. The property was more than 80 percent leased then.\nBarker Pacific Group still appears to hold ownership, though Rising\u2019s involvement is unclear. The borrower and owner entity, via recent business records, is connected to De La Hoya and Barker Pacific Group (one document signed by Barker himself and another by managing principal Mark Handin). De La Hoya signed the 2015 loan documents.\nGolden Boy Promotions representatives, Handin and Rising did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",

The entity, CG Miami River, allegedly failed to make the payment last month as required by a settlement agreement, the Jan. 13 complaint states.\nKarp, his lawyer Alex Barthet and the Chetrits did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe Karp-designed project was recently rebranded as\nFlow on the Miami River\nafter Neumann\u2019s Miami-based real estate firm, called\nFlow\n, partnered with Canada Global and Yakir Gabay\u2019s Yellowstone Trust to acquire a majority stake in the project in August from New York-based Chetrit Group.\nNeumann and partners provided a $525 million recapitalization.\nMeanwhile, CG Miami River modified a\n$310 million\nconstruction loan with Madison Realty Capital, increasing the mortgage by $9.5 million, records show.\nKarp withdrew a lien placed on the property in August so the Chetrits could close on the refinancing, under the terms of a settlement agreement to pay nearly $1 million in owed architecture fees, the lawsuit states.\nKarp\u2019s lawsuit alleges CG Miami River paid $300,000 when the loan closed but failed to pay the balance by a Dec. 9 deadline. The Chetrits signed as guarantors, per the complaint.\nKarp\u2019s lawsuit is the latest legal wrinkle around a\nMiami River site\nthat Chetrit has been trying to redevelop for more than a decade. The 4-million-square-foot project could eventually include up to 1,900 apartments and condos, 39,000 square feet of retail, office space, a 17-slip marina and 770 parking spaces.\nThe first phase, a 54-story tower with 632 apartments at 275 Southwest Sixth Street, is nearly completed. The project includes at least two other residential high-rises. Flow is managing the first tower and will lead development of the rest of the project as managing member of the majority ownership. The Chetrits retained a minority interest.",

Of the 456 units, 46 would be designated for rent at below-market rates, allowing developer Trammell Crow to take advantage of density bonus incentives allowing a taller structure with more units than zoning rules would typically allow.

Amenities planned for the residential complex north of\nSanta Monica Airport\ninclude a fitness center, lounge spaces, outdoor courtyards and roof decks.\nThe project is being designed by AC Martin. Renderings for the project indicate some residences would have recessed balconies and roof decks integrated into residences on the upper levels.\nUnder the City of Santa Monica\u2019s housing element, officials must plan for 8,874 new housing units by 2029; of those, 69 percent must be at various affordable income levels. To meet that goal, the city has been approving developers\u2019 affordable housing plans or looking to sell land to willing builders who vow to construct affordable units. Last year, the city sought developers to build affordable housing on three city-owned properties as the city works to comply with California\u2019s Surplus Land Act.\nIn September, the city\nadvanced an eight-story residential project\nat 1907-1933 Wilshire Boulevard set to contain 260 units, including 26 set aside for affordable housing.

        "content": "Unsheathe your\nauction\npaddles \u2014 a bidding tourney will decide the next owner of a siegeworthy estate near Houston.\nNathan Milner, a video game streamer known on YouTube as Unspeakable, is auctioning his realm in\nMagnolia\n, a suburb north of Houston. On almost 11 acres, the 7,200-square-foot home at 9011 Breckenridge Drive features five bedrooms, eight bathrooms, an outdoor kitchen and a game room, all guarded by a moat, according to marketing materials.\nAmenities include a basketball court and a workshop that can accommodate six vehicles. The property has an agricultural use exemption, a property tax advantage that also permits the owner to keep livestock on the land, Montgomery County records show.\nJLA Realty agent Jasmin Lye has the property listed for $3.5 million, amounting to about $500 per square foot. The property first listed in September for $3.8 million; the seller lowered the price in November, according to Zillow.\nSotheby\u2019s\nConcierge Auctions\nis handling the auction process. The company expects bids to start between $1 million and $2 million, according to marketing materials.\nConcierge will hold a preview event at the site on Feb. 1. Bidding opens on Feb. 12 and closes on Feb. 25.\nMilner\u2019s channel has over 19 million subscribers on YouTube. In one of his most-watched videos, published in August, Milner turns the property into a water park. The water slides have since been removed.\nHe purchased the property in 2020 through his company, Unspeakable Media LLC, for an undisclosed price, according to public records.\nAn auction resulted in Houston\u2019s most expensive sale of December. A home at 3102 Noble Lakes Lane that was previously owned by Nick Van Exel and once appeared on MTV\u2019s \u201cCribs\u201d\nasked $9.9 million before it went to auction\n. The winning bid hasn\u2019t been disclosed.\nConcierge is also handling the auction of manufacturing mogul\nChaz Neely\u2019s waterfront estate in Belton\n. Unlike Milner\u2019s property, the 13-acre Belton estate will undergo a live auction.\n",

        "content": "A proposed Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center outside Dallas is starting to look less hypothetical and more like a very real industrial real estate move with possible civic consequences.\nThe Washington Post first reported in December that ICE was planning a roughly 1-million-square-foot detention center in Hutchins \u2014 a small town in Dallas County southeast of Dallas \u2014 capable of holding up to 9,500 people, more than 10 times the capacity of the nearest ICE facility in Prairieland. The plan immediately rattled the city of fewer than 8,000 residents, whose mayor said publicly he did not want the project and noted only one warehouse in town is large enough to fit the bill, D Magazine\nreported\n.\nUntil now, neither\nICE\nnor any media outlet had identified a specific site or owner. But local clergy groups and community leaders say the location is an open secret.\nOn Friday, members of the Clergy League for Emergency Action and Response gathered in Dallas to protest the proposed center, saying ICE officials had privately confirmed the location to some members. The\nfacility\n, they said, is a 1-million-square-foot warehouse at 950 North I-45, next to the Hutchins State Jail, the outlet reported. A Majestic Realty listing for the address shows a building of just over 1 million square feet, aligning with earlier descriptions. The Dallas Central Appraisal District values the property at $80.1 million.\nPublic records list the owner as PS Hutchins Phase Two, a Delaware entity registered through an agent. Calls to the property listing went to the voicemail of a\nMajestic Realty\nsenior vice president. A document from the project\u2019s builder shows the warehouse was originally designed for Amazon, echoing Mayor Mario Vasquez\u2019s description of the only viable site in town.\nClergy members said ICE already conducted a site visit and\npurchased the building\nrather than leasing it, though the agency has not confirmed a transaction or even acknowledged a specific address. A title commitment dated last week for the property was shared with reporters, adding fuel to the speculation.\nThe real estate implications extend beyond the building itself. Bond documents from Hutchins show the property is among the city\u2019s top 10 taxpayers, accounting for about 3.8 percent of its tax base and generating roughly $1.8 million a year, according to the outlet. If ICE owns the facility, that revenue could disappear, complicating the city\u2019s ability to service debt. Infrastructure is another concern. Local leaders warn Hutchins lacks the water and sewer capacity to support what would effectively double its population overnight.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A hefty tax bill is coming due for Jeff Winick as his fall from the perch of his brokerage firm continues.\nA bankruptcy judge ordered the Winick Realty Group founder to pay approximately $9 million to the Internal Revenue Service for income tax he failed to pay between 2012 and 2016, Bisnow\nreported\n. The judge declared Winick\u2019s tax filings for those years an \u201coutright fabrication,\u201d though he was credited for paying $2 million in taxes from 2014 to 2020.\nThe bankruptcy judge\u2019s decision was reported first by\nBloomberg Law\n.\nThe ruling was years in the making. The IRS sued Winick in 2020, shortly after he filed for bankruptcy claiming $10 million in liabilities against only $500,000 in assets. The IRS alleged Winick was living it up and fraudulently transferring assets while ducking his income tax responsibilities.\nIn his defense, Winick pointed towards a gambling addiction, which cost him more than $12 million in the years prior to his bankruptcy. He also claimed he planned to pay his taxes with big business or gambling gains that failed to materialize.\nThe judge balked at his argument, pointing to years where Winick managed to gamble, pay taxes and still have the money for international trips, exorbitant rentals and family shopping sprees.\nWinick also allegedly transferred business and property shares to his daughter for no consideration, which the IRS alleged was likely a method to dodge taxes.\nWinick ultimately was\nforced to sell\na stake in his brokerage several years ago. Steven Baker, now chief executive officer, teamed up with colleagues Louis Eisinger and Lee Block to\npurchase a majority stake\nin the company in 2021.\nThe insiders scored a 63 percent stake after being selected as stalking horse bidders, a controversial proceeding due to the alleged involvement of Winick\u2019s daughter in the bid.\nLast year, Winick Realty Group\nrebranded\nas RTL, a name designed to reflect a focus on the retail industry. Winick remains an active dealmaker and has been listed as an exclusive agent on many of the brokerage\u2019s listings, continuing with RTL as an associate broker.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A 10-acre-plus waterfront resort and marina in the Florida Keys that once hosted actor Paul Newman and gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson is listed for sale for $45 million,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nSugarloaf Lodge &amp; Marina, near mile marker 17, consists of 31 hotel rooms and commercial space. The site at 17001 Overseas Highway comes with development rights to rebuild 24 hotel keys lost in Hurricane Wilma in 2005, according to listing broker Lisa Swanson.\nSwanson, of The Agency Florida Keys, is listing the property with Jamie Bederak, of The Agency Miami.\nThe asking price amounts to $1.45 million per hotel key.\nSugarloaf Lodge was built in the late 1950s by the Pennsylvania strip mining company that dredged and developed much of Sugarloaf Key. Additions were built in the 1960s. In 1973, husband-and-wife Lloyd and Miriam Good bought the property and moved to Sugarloaf Key to run the resort with their four children.\nThe property is now owned by entity Miriam BG, led by John Good and Caren Ward, children of the late Lloyd and Miriam Good. The entity also is led by Jessica Duncan Wex and Katchen Elizabeth Duncan, John Good\u2019s nieces.\nSugarloaf spans nearly 10.6 acres and includes a 12,700-square-foot hotel and a 5,300-square-foot restaurant leased to South of the Seven, plus a tiki bar and events venue. It includes office space, some of it leased to kayak and boat rental firms and a solar energy company, and it also has an apartment, marinas, a pool and tennis courts, according to Swanson and John Good.\nThe owners have preserved much of the property\u2019s original look, including Mid-Century Modern decor in the hotel rooms.\nThe property can be entirely redeveloped, though it would mean bigger setbacks from the bay, especially for the restaurant that now juts into the water atop stilts, due to changes in construction regulations. The development potential for 24 hotel keys is legally vested with the property.\nMonroe County caps heights to 38 feet, with officials considering legislation to increase this to 42 feet for residential uses.\nGood, who grew up on the property and hosted the 5 p.m. daily dolphins shows, recalled some of its history.\nDolly, a \u201cvery smart\u201d dolphin that escaped the U.S. Navy was a common visitor when the Good family arrived at Sugarloaf Lodge. The Goods removed any nets keeping her within the bay, and Dolly eventually swam away, as she wasn\u2019t too keen on doing the shows, Good said.\nJacques Cousteau had studied Dolly for her intelligence and featured her in one of his books. Sugar, the other bottlenose dolphin there, enjoyed performing, sticking around until her death in 1997, Good said.\nNewman was fun to talk with, Good said, and imparted some insight on his alma mater Kenyon College, where Good was headed at the time. Thompson \u201cwas kind of part of our family for a couple of years,\u201d Good said. A pig prank involving Thomson and Lloyd Good made it into Thomspon\u2019s \u201cSongs of the Doomed.\u201d\n\u201cCrazy times,\u201d John Good said. \u201cIt was the \u201970s and \u201980s \u2026 a lot of characters.\u201d\nThe Florida Keys are quieter than bustling Miami to the north, though the Keys also attracted some investment during South Florida\u2019s commercial and residential real estate boom of recent years.\nIn Islamorada, Barstool Sports owner Dave Portnoy bought the 1.7-acre waterfront mansion at 76180 Overseas Highway for\n$27.8 million\nin October.\nAlso in Islamorada, Frisbie Group sold the Islands of Islamorada resort consisting of 22 villas and an eight-key hotel for\n$72 million\nin 2024. Buyer Wills Companies launched\nsales\nof the villas last year.\nIn 2023, The Ardid family\u2019s Brickell-based Key International paid more than\n$37.6 million\nfor the 100-key Perry Hotel at 7001 Shrimp Road in Key West, and Miami-based Integra Investments paid about $29.7 million for the adjacent 288-slip, 35-acre Perry Marina at 7005 Shrimp Road.\n",

        "content": "Perot Jain is officially moving into Dallas\u2019 most rarefied office address \u2014 at Harlan Crow\u2019s Old Parkland campus.\nThe venture capital firm co-founded by Ross Perot Jr. and Anurag Jain opened a 4,200-square-foot office in Providence Hall, part of the newly built Old Parkland East campus, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The move places the firm inside the latest expansion of the historic\nOld Parkland\ncomplex, a\nJeffersonian-style enclave\nthat has become home to some of North Texas\u2019 wealthiest family offices, law firms, private equity shops and foundations.\nPerot Jain will consolidate its five-person team in the new space, while maintaining space at\nHillwood\nand the Perot Companies\u2019 Turtle Creek headquarters. The office marks a step forward for the firm, which launched in 2014 and has quietly built a portfolio of roughly 70 companies across logistics, mobility, industrial, defense and sports.\nThe deal comes as Crow Holdings continues to fill out Old Parkland East, a three-building expansion that added about 285,000 square feet to the campus, according to the publication. Bill Brokaw of Hillwood Urban represented Perot Jain in lease talks, while HPI Real Estate Services\u2019 Ben Cuzen handled the deal for Old Parkland.\nPerot Jain partner Aaron Pierce told the outlet that the draw was less about square footage than proximity. Old Parkland\u2019s tight-knit tenant roster has long functioned as an informal deal marketplace, where chance hallway conversations often lead to co-investments. Pierce previously worked on campus before joining Perot Jain and said the collaborative culture remains a differentiator.\nJain sold a majority stake in Access Healthcare to New Mountain Capital in January 2025 in a deal Bloomberg reported to be valued at $2 billion. That firm was later rolled into Smarter Technologies in a reported $6 billion combination, freeing Jain to focus more heavily on venture investing and his family office, which will also operate out of the\nOld Parkland\nspace.\nPerot Jain\u2019s focus is often on early-stage companies generating less than $1 million to a few million dollars in revenue. Its bets range from AI and cyber-defense firm Rilian to Casimir, a startup working on next-generation power technology, along with a stake in the Texas Super Kings cricket team, according to the Business Journal.\nThe move also highlights Old Parkland\u2019s continued appeal as Dallas\u2019 unofficial capital of private capital. While many office landlords are still fighting vacancies, the campus has leaned into exclusivity, curated tenancy and expansion.\nPierce, who also chairs nonprofit Venture Dallas, told the outlet that he sees the firm\u2019s new home as aligned with a broader regional push. Dallas-Fort Worth companies attracted more than $2 billion in venture funding across 222 deals in 2025, up sharply from the prior year, according to PitchBook-NVCA data.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Jeff Sutton is planting a flag in Miami\u2019s Design District by teaming up with Pebb Enterprises and Lane Capital Partners to acquire a fully leased mixed-use building for $72.5 million.\nThe joint venture, including Sutton\u2019s New York-based Wharton Properties, acquired the seven-story\nDesign 41\nat 112 Northeast 41st Street in Miami\u2019s high-end shopping district, according to a news release. Boca Raton-based Pebb Enterprises is led by Todd Rosenberg and New York-based Lane Capital is led by Alan Leavitt.\nTony Arellano and Devlin Marinoff with Dwntwn Realty Advisors brokered the transaction, representing the buyer and the seller,\nDesign District Development Partners\n, an entity managed by Benjamin Norton in Sarasota.\nThe previous sale price is not listed in records, but Design District Development Partners obtained a $24.3 million construction loan in 2016. Design 41 was completed two years later, records show.\nThe developer secured a\n$30 million\nbridge loan in 2018 that was increased by $11 million three years later, according to mortgage documents. It obtained a separate $4.3 million loan in 2024.\nSutton and his partners were looking initially to recapitalize the building but pivoted to buying it outright, Arellano said.The loans came due during the sale process, he added.\n\u201cWe had cascading loan maturities and challenging dynamics with the lenders,\u201d Arellano said. \u201cBut we got the deal done.\u201d\nThe building\u2019s office tenants include architecture firm Foster + Partners and the Miami office for David Edelstein\u2019s New York-based\nTriCap\n. Retail tenants on the ground floor, such as perfume shop Bond No. 9 NY and bedding store H\u00e4stens, are paying monthly rents of $1,526 a square foot, the release states. Dwntwn handles leasing.\nThe Design District is among the top retail destinations, and among the most expensive, in the U.S. Rents in the neighborhood skyrocketed by more than 200 percent, during a five year period ending in 2024, to an average of $500 per square foot, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield.\nLast month, Craig Robins\u2019 Dacra, L Catterton Real Estate and Brookfield added\n$100 million\nto a $250 million loan secured by six retail properties in the Design District.",

        "content": "Developer and Brea native Dwight Manley has closed his purchase of a business park in Brea, clearing the way for the Orange County city\u2019s first\nCostco\nlocation.\nHines\noffloaded\nthe Beckman Coulter Campus at 200 South Kraemer Street in Brea for $140 million, the Orange County Business Journal reported. Hines previously acquired the five-building office and industrial complex in 2018 for $115 million. The property totals 576,234 square feet across nearly 34 acres.\nLast month, Brea city leaders agreed to a 50-year sales tax rebate with Dwight Manley if he executes a lease with Costco as officials\nhoped\nto bring the big-box store to the city, the Los Angeles Times reported. The Brea City Council voted to give Manley a year to bring Costco to Brea once his acquisition of the 34-acre property was complete.\nUnder the agreement, Manley will receive a 100 percent rebate of the sales tax revenue generated by a future Costco location in the first two years. Over the course of the 50-year deal, the city would collect 42.5 percent of the sales tax. The deal works out to approximately $50 million in sales tax for the city and $83.5 million reimbursed to Manley. \u201cThis is the skinniest developer deal I\u2019ve ever heard of,\u201d Manley told the city council of the agreement at the time.\n\u201cCostco does not enter into agreements with cities,\u201d Manley said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the property owner. They\u2019ve had property owners do this in many instances where cities participated because they wanted a Costco.\u201d\nWhile Manley was negotiating with Hines, other bidders were interested in purchasing the site for other purposes, including an Amazon warehouse or high-density housing.\nCostco is in the process of growing its presence in Orange County.\nLast year, the wholesaler\nacquired two sites\nin Mission Viejo and Lake Forest in two separate deals to build new Costco locations. In Mission Viejo, Costco bought a former\nBed Bath &amp; Beyond\nat 25732 El Paseo for $14.4 million with plans to tear down the building and build a new fueling station with 40 pumps spanning more than 17,000 square feet next to I-405. In\nLake Forest\n\u2019s Foothill Ranch neighborhood, Costco picked up the defunct Regal Cinema at Foothill Ranch Towne Center for $12.5 million and is looking to replace it with a 160,811-square-foot store.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Eli Karp is suing the lender and appraiser of his foreclosed Hello Lenox apartment building, alleging they intentionally overvalued the Brooklyn property.\nKarp is accusing a Greystone affiliate and real estate valuation firm BBG of engineering a \u201cloan-to-own\u201d scheme that he says cost him his flagship property, per a lawsuit filed Monday in New York State Supreme Court. Karp alleges that Greystone, led by founder and CEO Stephen Rosenberg, conspired with BBG to dramatically inflate the value of his newly-built apartment complex at 271 Lenox Road in East Flatbush.\nThe inflated valuation, the suit claims, was used to lure Karp into a $34.5 million bridge loan that ultimately set the stage for a foreclosure. According to the complaint, BBG appraisers valued the 55-unit property at $46.2 million in 2019, an appraisal Greystone allegedly commissioned and paid for. Relying on that figure, Karp personally guaranteed the loan, which was intended to refinance construction debt and buy him time to sell the building, the suit alleges.\nAs the loan\u2019s maturity approached, Karp couldn\u2019t refinance the debt and defaulted, the suit says. Adding fuel to the allegations, BBG issued a second appraisal in 2024 valuing the same property at $29.6 million, a $16.6 million drop from the 2019 figure. Karp claims in the suit that the swing can\u2019t be explained by market conditions alone and instead proves the earlier appraisal was fraudulently inflated.\nThe property was ultimately sold at a foreclosure auction for $10 million to the Greystone affiliate. Karp is now on the hook for a $15 million personal guarantee.\n\u201cAll of this stems from a fraudulent appraisal and a loan that never should have been entered into,\u201d Karp\u2019s attorney Muriel Raggi said.\nKarp is seeking at least $16.6 million in damages tied to the alleged appraisal inflation, along with $122 million against Greystone and Rosenberg, alleging they cost him other opportunities by locking him into an exclusive loan letter of intent on other properties in his portfolio.\nRepresentatives for Greystone did not immediately respond to a request for comment. BBG declined to comment, saying they had not yet seen the suit.\nOnce a rising Brooklyn developer known for his sleek, \u201cHello\u201d-branded luxury rentals, Karp saw his empire unravel after his projects fell into distress. He has blamed Madison Realty Capital for buying his debt and piling on default interest (a charge the firm disputes) as foreclosures and bankruptcies swept through his portfolio.\n",

        "content": "\u201cNews\u201d is something important that happens. It can also be something that doesn\u2019t.\nIf Mayor Zohran Mamdani does not attempt to get the City Council to override Eric Adams\u2019 veto of the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act, that would be news.\nI say this because Mamdani has been a big proponent of COPA and its equivalent bill in Albany, TOPA (Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act). The bills, heavily opposed by the real estate industry, would\nstall sales\nof multifamily buildings for months to give tenants and nonprofits a better chance to buy them.\nAt this writing, Mamdani is just a few votes away from getting it enacted by the City Council. COPA passed with 30 votes and needs 34 to override the veto. (\nEleven\nof the Council\u2019s 51 members took office after the initial vote.)\nIn theory, it should not be hard for a popular new mayor coming off a resounding election victory \u2014 and a successful handling of his first blizzard \u2014 to flip a few votes in the 51-member Council.\nBut Mamdani has a lot of reasons not to even try on COPA.\nFor one thing, he doesn\u2019t want to big-foot new Council Speaker Julie Menin in the first month of their tenures. He just\npatched up their relationship\nand is going to need her for the next four years. Menin abstained from December\u2019s COPA vote and doesn\u2019t seem at all motivated to marshal votes to override the veto.\nSecond, Mamdani\u2019s base, including the Democratic Socialists of America, does not seem to be pushing for him to override the veto \u2014 even though COPA has been a DSA dream for some time.\nDSA often advocates for ideological bills, but has enough sense not to demand that its handful of elected members fall on their swords in an effort to pass them.\nThird, there\u2019s a racial and religious dynamic of which Mamdani must be very mindful: City Council member Darlene Mealy rounded up opposition to COPA by arguing it would be unfair to\nBlack and Jewish landlords\n. That\u2019s in large part why it fell short of a 34-vote \u201cveto-proof\u201d majority.\nMamdani\u2019s issues with conservative Jews have been well documented and he has been criticized for not naming any Black deputy mayors. \u201cIt has become a problem,\u201d a New York Times headline\ndeclared\n.\nHis failure to appoint a single Black deputy mayor came despite his desire to shore up support in heavily Black areas, where he got only 29 percent of the Democratic primary vote last June. This would not be a good time for him to anger Black and Jewish landlords, who are already furious about his call for a four-year freeze on stabilized rents and his pending\n\u201crental ripoff\u201d hearings\n.\nFourth, if he tries to override the veto and fails, that would show political weakness, especially after he tried and failed to stop Menin from becoming speaker. The optics of a second defeat in two months would be bad, and it would make it harder for him to win other battles.\nFor those reasons, it looks like my colleague Kathryn Brenzel\u2019s\nstory\nMonday was spot on: COPA is DOA.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nI misunderstood a sentence in a\nTRD story\nto mean that Summit Properties is raising money on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange for its purchase of the Pinnacle portfolio. That is not the case, according to a Summit spokesperson. The TASE disclosures it filed about the Pinnacle deal were to provide transparency for potential investors in an unrelated Summit investment.\nI was\ntrying to estimate\nSummit\u2019s potential return on investment for the Pinnacle acquisition. To do that, one would divide its annual profit by the $112.8 million it is contributing to the $451.3 million purchase. My rough calculation comes to 11 percent. Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Many apartment leases in Germany require tenants to open their windows several times a day, \u201ceven \u2014 or especially \u2014 in winter,\u201d the Washington Post\nreported\nin a story about the practice, called l\u00fcften. \u201cGerman courts have ruled that, absent specific landlord guidance, a tenant is required to open windows twice a day, morning and evening, for 10 minutes each.\u201d Via TikTok, the practice has spread to America, where it\u2019s called \u201chouse burping.\u201d\nElsewhere\u2026\nQueens Borough President Donovan Richards, perhaps the most pro-housing elected official in the city, told\nGothamist\nthat if a City Council member asks him to sustain the Council\u2019s rejection of new housing, \u201cthere has to be a scientific reason why either you\u2019re going to kill the project or have a substantial reduction in the unit counts.\u201d\nRichards and the other borough presidents have\nbecome relevant\nin land-use approvals again by virtue of a\nCity Charter revision\npassed by voters in November.\nRichards knows that when NIMBYs oppose a project or rezoning, their rationale is less scientific than emotional (fear of change) or financial (keeping housing scarce increases their homes\u2019 value).\nThey do often present a scientific reason, but not based on any data, such as \u201cthe sewer system cannot handle it\u201d or \u201cthe streets will be gridlocked.\u201d Which makes it pseudo-science. Richards has undoubtedly noticed that ordinary citizens suddenly become infrastructure experts when faced with the prospect of new neighbors.\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$24.3 million\nfor a 4,997-square-foot, sponsor-sale condominium unit at 20 East 76th Street on the Upper East Side.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$8 million\nfor a 17-unit apartment building at 44 Perry Street in the West Village.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$10 million\nfor a pre-war co-op at 820 Park Avenue in Lenox Hill. Daniella G. Schlisser, Justin J. Pak and Gigi Ozdemir with Brown Harris Stevens have the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building permit filed was for a proposed 43,127-square-foot, 79-unit residential building at 9528 147th Place in Jamaica. Leandro Dickson filed the permit on behalf of Herman Jacob.\n\u2014\nMatthew Elo",

The unit went on the market in September for just under $4 million.\nBy the Numbers:\nThese were the most expensive neighborhoods in Brooklyn in 2025\nBrooklyn\u2019s residential market grew in 2025, thanks to a record-smashing deal in Gravesend and strong appetite for homes in\ntree-lined, brownstone-heavy\nneighborhoods close to Manhattan.\nCobble Hill led the charge, as it did in 2024, with the highest average home sale price last year, according to a\nTRD\nData analysis of deeds filed with the city last year. However, Cobble Hill\u2019s average of about $2.9 million was about 5 percent lower than its average of $3.1 million the year before.\nNeighborhoods closer to Manhattan dominated the top 100 home sales in Brooklyn last year. For instance, the second-priciest deal was for a Brooklyn Heights townhouse at\n35 Remsen Street\nthat went for more than $18.4 million.\nHere is where Brooklyn\u2019s top home sales were located last year.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

Before that, she held various other city jobs and worked as chief of staff and director of budget and legislation for Council member Margaret Chin.\nShe also brings experience that doesn\u2019t often appear on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 otherwise dominated by public service: Kitasei is an author of speculative fiction. Her forthcoming novel, \u201cEnvoy,\u201d is described as a sci-fi mystery thriller about five astronauts who become the target of an unknown killer.\nDCAS, among other responsibilities, manages the city\u2019s roughly 400 leases at private properties, spanning 22 million square feet, alongside the city\u2019s own 15 million square feet. The little-known agency was recently dragged into the limelight after investigators seized the phones of Adams\u2019 administration officials as they were returning from vacation together in late 2024.\nThose officials included\nJesse Hamilton\n, then the deputy commissioner of real estate at the DCAS. The incident heightened scrutiny around some of the deals Hamilton worked on or\npromoted\n, including a warehouse in the Bronx the city ultimately decided against buying. \u00a0 Hamilton was indicted in August on a conspiracy charge related to allegedly working with Ingrid Lewis-Martin, a former top aide to the mayor, to speed up certain developers\u2019 projects and steer city contracts to preferred players. He\nresigned\nin August.\nKitasei is stepping into the role after J. Carolina Chavez, who has served as acting commissioner since Commissioner Louis Molina resigned last month.\n",

        "content": "PMG and Lndmrk Development are launching a Frida Kahlo-branded short-term rental-friendly condominium in Miami\u2019s Wynwood, their latest partnership in the neighborhood.\nThe likeness of the famed Mexican communist will decorate one of the luxury project\u2019s facades, renderings show. The developers are planning the 244-unit Frida Kahlo Wynwood Residences for the 1-acre site at 119 Northwest 29th Street, which they bought for\n$20 million\nin 2023, according to property records.\nThey tapped Uruguayan-Canadian architect Carlos Ott, Cube 3, and Cotofana Designs to design the complex, according to a news release. It will span two buildings, with an eight-story north tower and a 14-story south tower, a spokesperson confirmed. Units will range from studios to three-bedrooms and come fully furnished.\nThe condo\u2019s amenities will include a rooftop pool, a fitness center, spa facilities and a lobby lounge, the release shows. Prices for the units start at $500,000 and range up to $1.6 million, the spokesperson confirmed. PMG will lead sales in-house for the project.\nThe developers are also partnering with Baker Health, a New York-based concierge medicine service, to open its first Florida location on the ground floor of the project. Residents will receive a free membership to the service for one year, the release shows.\nThe late Frida Kahlo is one of the most famous women artists in the world, and her paintings are among the most valuable. Her 1940 painting \u201cEl sue\u00f1o (La cama)\u201d sold for a record $55 million at Sotheby\u2019s in November, making it the most expensive piece ever sold at auction by a woman artist. The record for men is held by Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cSalvator Mundi,\u201d which sold for $450.3 million in 2017.\nWhile the November auction sale was notable for its price, it was also remarkable as Kahlo\u2019s paintings are rarely available for purchase.\nHer husband, Diego Rivera, bequeathed the couple\u2019s works to the people of Mexico, and the Bank of Mexico owns and manages their trust and estate.\nThat her name and likeness can be licensed for condo branding purposes is the result of her niece Isolda Pineda Kahlo\u2019s 2004 partnership with ItalBank president Carlos Dorado. The pair created the Frida Kahlo Corporation and trademarked the artist\u2019s name, face and signature.\nSince Pineda Kahlo\u2019s death in 2007, the corporation has come into conflict with her daughter, who sued in 2019 over the creation of a Frida Kahlo Barbie.\nThe branding agreement between the Frida Kahlo Corporation, PMG and Lndmrk is an example of one of South Florida\u2019s busiest new development categories: branded residences.\nThousands of units are planned or in development across the region bearing familiar logos from\nfashion houses\n,\nhospitality empires\n,\nhypercar makers\n,\nrestaurant groups\nand\nmagazines\n. Developers see brands as a way to signal expectations of prestige and hospitality service to buyers, and a way to differentiate projects in a crowded marketplace.\nThat said, industry leaders have also advised caution on brand selection.\n\u201cNot all brands are created equal,\u201d Cervera Real Estate\u2019s Alicia Cervera Lamadrid said at\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\n2024 Miami Forum\n.\nPMG and Lndmrk opted out of branding for their other Wynwood condo project. Miami-based PMG, led by Ryan Shear, Dan Kaplan and Kevin Maloney, and Alex Karakhanian\u2019s Miami-based Lndmrk launched sales for the 233-unit short-term rental-friendly\nTwenty Sixth &amp; 2nd Wynwood Residences\nin April, with prices for studios starting at $500,000.\n",

        "content": "Real estate remained upbeat on a\nproposed ballot measure\nto amend the so-called\nmansion tax\neven as the Los Angeles City Council told one of its most prominent members to slow her rollback.\nA fiery debate ensued during Tuesday\u2019s Los Angeles City Council meeting over the fast-tracking of a proposed 15-year carveout of the Measure United to House L.A. tax for new multifamily, commercial and mixed-use developments, in addition to an exemption for property owners impacted by a natural disaster.\nCurrently, ULA applies a 4 percent property transfer tax on all real estate deals \u2013 commercial or single-family \u2013 starting at $5.3 million. The tax bumps up to 5.5 percent on deals of $10.6 million or more.\nThe request to draft a ballot measure for June was made Friday by progressive councilwoman Nithya Raman, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America who became a leader of the progressive wing of the council in part for her role as an early a proponent of Measure ULA\u2019s stated mission of\nfunding homelessness and affordable housing programs\n.\nRaman said the amendments would fix the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of the two-tier tax, noting that ULA \u201cwas sold to voters as a mansion tax\u201d but also applies to other segments of\u00a0 real estate and has cast a pall over dealmaking and development of apartments and commercial projects.\nShe told her colleagues on the 15-seat council that it has essentially placed \u201ca transfer tax on all properties over $5 million, including apartments and we have to be honest about what has happened as a result.\u201d\nThe biggest takeaway of Raman\u2019s proposal would be a permanent, 15-year carveout seen as an incentive for new construction of multifamily properties of at least four units. It would also apply to commercial projects, defined as anything that doesn\u2019t have residential. It\u2019s the first major proposal aimed at addressing Measure ULA\u2019s effect on the multifamily and commercial segments.\nSean Burton, CEO and chief investment officer of Cityview, hailed Raman\u2019s motion as a \u201chuge move forward\u201d and the result of several months of negotiations between government officials, the business community, real estate interests and non-profits looking at ways of fixing the tax.\nSome of Raman\u2019s peers lashed out at the lack of public debate over the proposal.\nThat included 7th District representative Monica Rodriguez, who took Raman to task for the \u201cfalse narrative\u201d used to prompt ULA during a citywide campaign in 2022, accusing her colleague of selling the tax to voters without any studies.\n\u201cWe knew that these were the implications \u2026 when we were having these conversations around ULA and we\u2019ve been calling it out for, oh, well over a year, but it was convenient to ignore it when the money was being doled out to different initiatives that people wanted to support,\u201d Rodriguez told Raman during Tuesday\u2019s meeting.\nRaman\u2019s colleagues on Tuesday kicked her proposal for a ballot measure on the proposed carveouts to the Housing and Homelessness Committee rather than holding a vote of the full council.\nMore recent attempts to amend ULA have largely been spurred by Palisades\nFire-impacted property owners\n. Those concerns are also addressed in Raman\u2019s proposal with a one-time, three-year exemption in cases of natural disasters that would be retroactive to January of last year.\nMeanwhile, there are language changes as it relates to existing affordable housing exemptions.\nBaby steps\nEven with what\u2019s on the table, real estate says there could be more.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really good step in the right direction,\u201d Cityview\u2019s Burton said of the proposed changes. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly not going as far as many in the city would like and many real estate interests would like.\u201d\nStill, the CEO said a full repeal of the tax isn\u2019t practical and Raman\u2019s proposal will \u201ckickstart the building of housing again.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen construction fall off a cliff for any sort of market rate housing or affordable housing,\u201d Burton said of the market since the tax went into effect. \u201cL.A.\u2019s been redlined by the investment community because of ULA. It makes investing in L.A. non-economic. I think the mayor realizes that and the councilwoman realizes that. I give her credit for having the guts to push this.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad policy to begin with,\u201d Mike Leipart, co-founder and managing principal of real estate sales and advisory firm Redeavor, said of ULA. \u201cBut, setting that aside, [the proposal\u2019s] better than nothing. Treating multifamily and commercial with the same thresholds was absurd from the start. Better than nothing, not near enough, is what I would say.\u201d\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California founder and CEO Aaron Kirman agreed.\n\u201cAny policy that encourages development and acknowledges the economic realities facing builders and property owners is a positive step,\u201d Kirman said.\nThe luxury residential agent hailed the natural disaster exemptions but noted \u201cthere is still work to be done to ensure ULA does not continue to discourage investment at a time when Los Angeles needs housing and economic momentum.\u201d\nMott Smith, an adjunct professor of real estate at the University of Southern California Price School and chair of the Council of Infill Builders, offered a blunt assessment of what ULA is and has been for the market.\n\u201cThe only word I know for this is clusterfuck,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s really kind of a mess.\u201d\nFrom Smith\u2019s view, the tax is \u201cfailing on all fronts\u201d except for the fact that it is indeed raising money, albeit at a lower rate than what was first estimated to taxpayers.\n\u201cWhat it is not doing effectively is funding affordable housing and this is because ULA is a ballot box version 1.0 that became law and the people that wrote it wrote it with a high degree of specificity and rigidity about how the money gets spent,\u201d he said.\n\u201cRushed\u201d process\nOpposition to the proposed amendments say the changes give in to real estate interests and stymie a revenue source that is upholding its promise to voters.\nThe Measure United to House coalition \u2014 a group of nonprofits, labor unions, affordable housing builders, homeless service providers and other supporters of the tax \u2014 said ULA revenue has been pumped into 795 affordable homes and provided rental or other assistance to 10,000 people in the city.\nThe coalition\u2019s director Joe Donlin called the proposed amendments \u201crushed\u201d and sided with the councilmembers who said it lacks any formal public discussion.\n\u201cThis is really a conversation about something that\u2019s really working for the city,\u201d Donlin said.\nCritics of the tax say otherwise and point to the $1 billion-metric that is touted by supporters. Since April 2023, when the tax went into effect, it has generated a little over $1 billion. The text of the measure that went before voters estimated the tax would generate anywhere from $600 million to $1.1 billion annually.\nDonlin also disputed any claims that the real estate market has been hindered by ULA.\n\u201cThe real estate market in L.A., just like real estate markets all around the country, have been deeply impacted by big, macroeconomic factors like high interest rates and inflating insurance premiums and higher construction costs,\u201d Donlin said. \u201cAnd, yet, we also have seen at each stage of the development process there are signs that L.A.\u2019s real estate market is trending in an upward direction.\u201d\n",

        "content": "In what is shaping into a recent Chicagoland trend, a proposed $2 billion data center in\nBarrington Hills\nis officially dead, the latest sign that suburban Chicago\u2019s once-red-hot data center pipeline is running into organized resistance.\nVillage officials announced that Chicago-based Brennan Investment Group withdrew its proposal for a massive data center campus planned south of Penny Road and west of Pond Gate Drive. The Daily Herald\nreported\nthat the developer canceled a scheduled public presentation before the village\u2019s plan commission slated for Feb. 2 after what officials described as negative early feedback.\n\u201cAt this time, the village considers this matter closed and does not anticipate any further discussion,\u201d a village spokesperson said in a Facebook post announcing the withdrawal. The special meeting was canceled.\nDetails on the project were limited, but the scale alone set off alarm bells in the rural enclave known for its large estates and conservation-focused zoning. Opposition quickly mobilized, according to the outlet. A Change.org\npetition\nurging officials to reject the development had collected more than 1,300 signatures as of Tuesday, citing concerns about air pollution, water quality and long-term tax impacts.\n\u201cWe cannot allow this proposal to compromise the very essence of what makes Barrington Hills a special place,\u201d the petition stated.\nBrennan, which has been active in data centers, is the developer of similar projects in\nElk Grove Village\nand Rolling Meadows, according to public records. The firm did not publicly comment on its decision to pull the Barrington Hills proposal.\nThe retreat highlights how quickly the political calculus around data centers has shifted. For years, the facilities were the quiet darlings of municipal finance, with massive capital investment, limited traffic and steady property tax revenue. Approvals were\noften routine\n, as previously chronicled in\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThat era appears to be ending, at least in parts of suburban Chicago.\nJust last week, Lisle officials\npaused a proposed data center\nafter residents packed Village Hall with objections. In Naperville, the City Council rejected Karis Critical\u2019s data center proposal in a 6-1 vote following months of neighborhood opposition. Aurora, meanwhile, enacted a 180-day\nmoratorium\nin September to revisit its data center regulations, signaling broader unease with the facilities.\nThe local backlash comes even as the regional data center boom continues to\nsurge\n. In northwest Indiana, Amazon is planning multiple data center campuses with total investment that could exceed $15 billion, including a confirmed site in Hobart. Farther north, T5 Data Centers has spent more than $60 million assembling land in\nGrayslake\n, a project that has already required significant power commitments from ComEd and drawn scrutiny over its proximity to homes.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The Latin School of Chicago is heading for the exits on four historic\nNear North Side\nhomes it scooped up just four years ago, preparing to sell the properties at an estimated $2 million loss.\nThe private school is marketing four buildings on the 1500 block of North Dearborn Street that it bought in spring 2022 for just over $10 million,\naccording\nto Crain\u2019s. The combined asking price for all four is about $8.1 million, with two already listed and two more expected to hit the market shortly.\nLatin acquired the homes in three deals as part of a long-term vision to expand and improve facilities for its lower school, serving students from junior kindergarten through fourth grade. But plans changed. In a letter sent to the school community in November and shared with the publication, board leaders said a subsequent multimillion-dollar upgrade to the existing lower school building eliminated the need for the Dearborn properties.\nThe letter also cited the disruption that a major construction project would cause, noting that redevelopment of the four buildings would likely require years of relocation for students and staff. The school declined to comment on the decision to sell at a loss.\nTwo of the properties, redstone buildings at 1511 and 1515 North Dearborn dating to 1890, were listed this week at $1.6 million apiece. The interiors were already gutted when Latin bought them and remain shells, according to\nCompass agent Jeff Lowe\n, who is marketing the pair. Latin is hoping to sell them together, potentially to a developer eyeing condos or to a buyer interested in restoring them as single-family homes.\nThe other two buildings, greystones at 1505 and 1507 Dearborn\nbuilt in the 1880s\n, contain a combined 15 apartments and are expected to list soon for just under $4.9 million, combined. Lowe and Interra Realty\u2019s\nJoe Smazal\nwill handle that listing, according to the publication. Those buildings are being sold as going concerns, with leased units and a mix of historic and modern finishes.\nAt the time of the purchase, then\u2013head of school Randall Dunn said Latin had no specific plan, but wanted to secure rare real estate opportunities in a dense neighborhood. Three years later, the school\u2019s own\nstudent newspaper reported\nthat concrete plans for the properties had yet to materialize, while the school was spending roughly $290,000 a year on taxes and maintenance.\nThe sale comes amid leadership turnover, with two heads of school departing since the acquisitions.\nLatin will still be a dominant presence on the block. Including the four buildings now for sale, the school owns eight of the 10 properties on the east side of Dearborn between North Avenue and Burton Place, anchored by an 18,000-square-foot mansion it bought in 2017 for $12 million.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Jasinski is leading the Jasinski Home Team at Baird &amp; Warner\u2019s La Grange office.\nIn a press release, the firm said Jasinski\u2019s return was an example of its\nappeal as a local powerhouse\nversus a field of nationally consolidated competitors.\nWhen Jasinski left Baird &amp; Warner in 2021, he said he thought of it as \u201cyour grandfather\u2019s real estate company.\u201d Its purchase of\ntech-focused Dream Town\nin 2025 made him interested in coming back, he said.\nWhen he returned in December, he said he was surprised at how much the firm had embraced technology. The company\nreleased an AI chatbot\nfor its agents in December.\n\u201cThey actually have systems that are functioning and working together, and are actively working on new ones,\u201d Jasinski said. \u201cIt was truly like night and day.\u201d\nJasinski spent the last five years at Berkshire Hathaway Home Services Chicago, and was a Baird &amp; Warner agent for nine years before that.\nJasinski\u2019s team closed $26.5 million in sales across 70 transactions in 2024, according to Real Trends. He has two more agents on his team and said he\u2019s interested in expanding.\nBaird &amp; Warner also recently picked up a Highland Park team from Compass, citing the addition as another example of the firm\u2019s ability to attract talent from the most competitive national firms.\nThe Gerber Diaz Group, led by Louis Diaz and Joe Tyler Gerber, moved to Baird &amp; Warner\u2019s Highland Park office in late 2025. Gerber closed more than $25 million in sales volume in 2024, Baird &amp; Warner said.\nBaird &amp; Warner said in a press release the brokerage\u2019s independence and local origin was a major influence in their decision to jump from Compass.\nCompass adds team with multifamily focus\nMeanwhile,\nCompass\nis attracting heavy hitters by pitching its own technology platform and reach. In early January, the brokerage brought on Charlie Cohen and Alex Morsch to create the Cohen Morsch team.\nThe five-agent team had combined annual sales of $57.5 million, Compass said in a press release. The group will focus on brokering multifamily and investment properties.\nCohen was most recently director of sales at Cross Street. In a press release announcing the move, Cohen said Compass\u2019 platform and tools will \u201celevate how we serve clients.\u201d\nMorsch was most recently a senior broker at Cross Street, Compass said. Morsch represented the buyer on a three-lot development site in Lincoln Park that sold for $5.7 million last year, the release said.\nCompass\nfinalized its acquisition of Anywhere Real Estate\nthis month, with the megamerger bringing some of Chicago\u2019s top brokerages under Compass\u2019 umbrella.\nJameson Sotheby\u2019s gains Baird &amp; Warner agent\nJameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\nis also expanding its roster. The firm brought on Joanne DeSanctis Kirk to its Chicago City Hub office this month.\nDeSanctis Kirk, who was previously at Baird &amp; Warner, said she wasn\u2019t expecting to make a move. But after conversations with Jameson Sotheby\u2019s representatives, she felt it was a good fit and gave her support as a solo agent. She said the firm\u2019s coordinated support between marketing and transactions has been a benefit.\n\u201cI had good support previously, but it was bifurcated,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this is kind of a one stop shop.\u201d\nAs a solo agent, DeSanctis Kirk averages about $10 million to $15 million in sales a year, she said. She closed about $13.8 million in sales across 17 transactions between October 2024 and October 2025, according to data compiled by\nThe Real Deal.\nHer sales are spread across Chicago but focused in the North Side, she said.\nColdwell Banker brings on North Shore manager\nAt Coldwell Banker Realty, Natasha O\u2019Connor was appointed branch vice president of the brokerage\u2019s North Shore offices in Glenbrook and Lake Forest, Chicago Agent reported this month.\nO\u2019Connor was formerly a managing broker at @properties until 2023, according to her LinkedIn.

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s multifamily construction drought isn\u2019t expected to improve any time soon, a report from Marcus and Millichap predicts.\nBy analyzing planned and ongoing multifamily developments, the brokerage predicts that this year Chicago is on track to see the smallest number of new apartments completed since 2012.\nLess than 4,000 new units will be completed this year, according to the report.\nThe pipeline issue has been brewing for a few years. Chicago\u2019s inventory of multifamily units grew at the fourth-slowest pace among major U.S. markets for the past three years, the brokerage found.\nPart of that is due to higher interest rates and escalating construction costs. But it\u2019s supercharged in Chicago specifically due to restrictive zoning,\ninfluence of aldermanic privilege over new developments\n,\nupheaval in the property tax system\nand investors\u2019 and lenders\u2019 fears of the city\u2019s progressive policies. Among them are right of first refusal ordinances that are\ncurrently being tested\nin\nseveral neighborhoods.\nThe tight supply is good news for current multifamily building owners and sellers, but means competition is high among buyers, and developers will face less equity investment and lending.\nAs low supply has driven up rents in recent years, Marcus &amp; Millichap predicts that trend will slow this year due to a slowdown in hiring that typically brings new professionals to the city.\nAcross the metro area, the 20 to 34-year-old renter population has been shrinking, according to the report.\nThe brokerage predicts that investment activity will continue to pick up along the North Lakefront-Rogers Park corridor in 2026.\nMeanwhile, developers seem to be favoring the outer suburbs. Lake County-Kenosha is slated to receive the most new units in 2026, the report found.\nAn Interra Realty report from last year found that\nmultifamily building sales in the Chicago suburbs were up 40 percent, year-over-year\n, in the third quarter, and a few outer-ring counties stood out in the competitive field.\nWill County\u2019s largest deal last year was the sale of the\nLincoln Station Apartments.\nAfter a decade-long construction quest and an ensuing legal dispute, rescue capital lender 7 Acre Investments gave developer Richard Gammonley the green light to sell his newly built complex in New Lenox. Miami-based JSB Capital bought the 220-unit property from Gammonley and 7 Acre for $65 million.",

Building 12 at 1070 Maryland Street spans approximately 200,000 square feet and was once home to shipbuilding operations during World War II. The firm\u2019s move into 70,000 square feet makes it one of the largest venture capital tenants in San Francisco history by footprint, according to the Chronicle.\nGeneral Catalyst is moving from a roughly 12,000-square-foot office at 75 Hawthorne Street in\nSouth of Market\n.\nBuilding 12 has already\nattracted\nretail tenants such as Breadbelly and Standard Deviant Brewing and is the first part of Brookfield\u2019s plans for Pier 70, the San Francisco Business Times reported. New York-based Brookfield has been approved to turn the Pier 70 property into as many as 2,150 homes and nearly 1.8 million square feet of commercial space.\nBrookfield initially planned to deliver the first phase of Pier 70, including hundreds of homes and almost half a million square feet of offices, between 2022 and 2024, though the pandemic slowed down those efforts. So far, Brookfield has delivered new site infrastructure and renovated Building 12, both of which were completed before construction stalled. The 28-acre waterfront redevelopment is a public-private partnership between Brookfield and the Port of San Francisco and was valued at $3.5 billion in 2020.\nGeneral Catalyst manages $43 billion in assets and has backed\nAirbnb\n, Instacart and\nAnthropic\n\u2014 all companies with San Francisco headquarters. It won\u2019t be the only venture capital firm at Pier 70, as Monograph Capital inked a lease there in 2024.

        "content": "Seguin is officially putting public backing behind one of its largest commercial retail projects to date.\nThe Seguin City Council authorized City Manager Steve Parker last week to move forward with an economic development agreement with NewQuest for a 543-acre tract at the northwest corner of I-10 and Highway 46, within the Austin-San Antonio corridor. The San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\nthat the deal advances plans for Seguin Town Center, a master-planned project that could ultimately deliver more than 600,000 square feet of retail and anchor the city\u2019s fast-growing north side.\nNewQuest\n, a Houston-based retail and mixed-use developer, spent years assembling and entitling large sites across Texas. In Seguin, the firm is positioning Town Center as a regional draw rather than a neighborhood strip center, city officials told the outlet.\nThe agreement approved by council is tied to a Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone created last year that covers the\nNewQuest site\n. Under the structure, a portion of the new tax revenue generated by development can be reinvested back into the project area. Guadalupe County has agreed to participate in the TIRZ, while\nSeguin\nis capturing part of the increment, allowing additional revenue from the site to flow into the city\u2019s general fund.\nCity leaders emphasized that the incentives are fully performance-based. No upfront payments are required, and if NewQuest fails to build, the city pays nothing.\nTo qualify for incentives, the developer must meet minimum thresholds, including at least $75 million in capital investment, construction of at least 200,000 square feet of retail and a lease from a nationally branded anchor tenant of at least 60,000 square feet, according to meeting documents. If those benchmarks are hit, NewQuest could receive up to $23.5 million in incentive value over a 20-year term, capped at roughly 10 percent of the project\u2019s anticipated value and limited to retail components.\nEconomic Development Director Alora Wachholz, who took the role in November, said the agreement signals alignment between the city and the developer and moves the project closer to construction.\nNewQuest is preparing to begin infrastructure and drainage work required before vertical construction can start. Groundbreaking for the first phase of retail is expected before mid-2026, with additional tenant announcements anticipated throughout the year.\nThe timing reflects\nSeguin\u2019s growth trajectory\n. The city\u2019s population has climbed from about 27,550 in 2015 to nearly 39,000 currently and is projected to top 50,000 by 2030, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Irvine Company\n\u2019s plans to turn the\nOak Creek Golf Club\ninto a master-planned community are coming into focus.\nThe Newport Beach-based development firm\nunveiled\nplans to add a 50-acre nature park to its proposed redevelopment of the Oak Creek Golf Club in Irvine, the Orange County Business Journal reported.\nThe broader redevelopment plan for the golf course, dubbed Oak Park Village, would cover approximately 216 acres at the northeastern end of the Irvine Spectrum District.\nThe area has been approved for 5,000 homes, and Irvine Company originally planned to build 3,100 residential units in a mix of apartments and single-family homes, an elementary school and parks as well as make improvements to transportation and infrastructure in the area.\nWith the new planned nature park, the number of residential units is expected to decrease as the green space would abut the Southern California Edison easement along Jeffrey Road between Walnut Avenue and Irvine Center Drive. Any possible changes to housing plans have not been revealed.\nIrvine Company officials are seeking the city\u2019s approval for the park by this summer, with work expected to begin early next year.\nCity politicians\nview the proposed Oak Park Village as beneficial in helping the municipality in meeting its state-mandated housing goals, which include\nplanning\nfor 23,610 new units by 2029.\nOn Jan. 15, the Committee to Protect All Irvine Open Space filed paperwork for a citizen initiative to reaffirm Initiative 88-1, a measure approved by voters in 1988 that requires citywide voter approval before residential development can occur on land designated as permanent open space.\nRolf Parkes, the vice chair of the committee which also includes two former Irvine mayors, said that part of the 216-acre Oak Park Village project consists of areas that the city has long deemed \u201copen space.\u201d Parkes is in favor of the nature park but is opposed to building homes and apartments that would bring increased traffic and congestion to the area, he told the Business Journal.\nThe committee hopes to collect signatures from more than 19,000 registered voters in Irvine to\nput the issue before voters\non the November ballot. Irvine Company cannot develop other open space areas outside the Oak Creek Golf Club because the firm transferred ownership of the land to the city, a spokesperson told the Business Journal.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

In Texas, some have bet on Fredericksburg, the seat of deer hunting, wine tasting and hobby farming country.\nNot many likely would bet on Houston.\nTexas\u2019 most populous, sprawling city isn\u2019t a getaway resort town. But according to agent Tommy Kanarellis, who recently returned to Houston after several years working in Aspen, an opportunity awaits to satisfy the mounting demand for luxury living in the Bayou City.\nThe Ritz-Carlton Residences of Houston\n, one of\nseveral branded condo projects underway\nin the city, hired Kanarellis as associate sales director, according to a press release from\nRedeavor Group\n, which is managing sales for the development.\nKanarellis was the\ntop-ranked condo sales agent\nin Houston in 2021, when he worked for the Houston office of Compass Real Estate.\nHe left Compass in 2022\n, worked a brief stint at Douglas Elliman, and returned to Compass in 2023. After working in both cities, helping Houstonians find second homes in Aspen, Kanarellis devoted his energies to Colorado starting in 2023, according to his personal website.\nWhile general housing abounds in the Houston area, luxury homes are in short supply, according to local agents. Luxury sells faster in Houston compared to other Texas metros, and\nit occupies a remarkably tight quarter\nof the sprawling city.\nNot much exists outside of River Oaks and Memorial Villages\n.\nThe Ritz-Carlton Residences of Houston isn\u2019t the only branded condo project taking shape in Houston. With buyers from the aerospace, medicine and energy industries in the mix, Houston developers are racing to refine the city\u2019s luxury living options.\nAuberge-branded and St. Regis-branded projects\nare also in the works, and\nanother Ritz-Carlton project is rising in the Woodlands\n.\nElsewhere in Houston, Ryan Fassett is joining Houston-based commercial real estate firm Oxford Partners as senior vice president, according to a press release. Fassett has focused on office and industrial tenant representation during his 15-year career, including posts at UGL Equis, Moody Rambin and Lee &amp; Associates.\nMeanwhile, Dallas-based architecture and engineering firm Premier, a privately owned subsidiary of\nMonty Bennett\n\u2019s Ashford, promoted Johannes Michalsky to CEO on Jan. 1, according to a press release. Michalsky has spent 12 years at Premier, including a year as COO since 2024.\nAshford focuses primarily on hospitality, but Premier also operates in the student housing and general multifamily sectors.\n",

HHM paid\n$42.3 million\nfor the 10-story hotel in 2015, records show.\nThe hotel is near Miami International Airport and the $1 billion Miami\nFreedom Park\n, a massive mixed-use project anchored by a nearly completed soccer stadium that is the future home of Inter Miami CF, the city\u2019s Major League Soccer franchise.\nMiami Freedom Park is being developed by billionaire Miami businessman Jorge Mas, retired international soccer star David Beckham and Los Angeles-based Ares Management.

        "content": "One penthouse is left for sale at Houston\u2019s forthcoming\nSt. Regis condo project\n, and the listing price blows the city\u2019s other\ncondo sales\nout of the water.\nThe 4,670-square-foot unit is listed for $14.5 million or $3,100 per square foot. It\u2019s one of 90 condos at the 37-story tower planned for 102 Asbury Street at the doorstep of Houston\u2019s exclusive River Oaks neighborhood. The property\u2019s 40,000 square feet of amenities will include a 20th-floor cognac bar, pool deck with cabanas, spa, and to protect the property from Texas\u2019 notoriously finicky electrical grid, a full-building generator back-up.\nDouglas Elliman said the listing boasts the highest price per square foot in the history of Houston condo sales.\nHouston Association of Realtors data backs up the grandiose claim. The top 10 most expensive high-rise sales recorded in Houston range in asking price from $4.9 million to $7.5 million, putting prices per square foot at between $421 and $1,290.\nA unit at The Huntingdon, at 2121 Kirby Drive, tops the list, according to HAR. The 7,265-square-foot condo was listed for $7.5 million, or just over $1,000 per square foot, when it traded in June 2024.\nDeveloper Satya\u2019s St. Regis project, which is expected to start construction in the first quarter, is part of a\nbranded condo craze\ntaking over Houston. In addition to the St. Regis, other planned projects include a\nRitz-Carlton rising in the Woodlands\n, another\nRitz-Carlton planned for the Galleria\nand Auberge condos coming to Upper Kirby.\nThe Real Deal\npartnered with BSH to\nhost a panel on the trend\nin December at the BSH Experience &amp; Design Center.\nTexas luxury buyers have long favored ranches over vertical living, and, as a result, the state\u2019s\nmarket for luxury condos\nis still largely untapped. That\u2019s partly because it\u2019s hard to get condo projects financed in the Lone Star State. Texas is one of about a dozen states that does not allow developers to use deposits from condo presales on construction. In states without those restrictions, deposits can finance up to 30 percent of construction costs, said DC Partners\u2019 Roberto Contreras IV.\nThe structural challenges mean not much condo inventory exists in Texas metros, but the Houston projects in the pipeline have already started proving the city\u2019s demand for luxury vertical living.\nIn addition to the price record set at the St. Regis,\nRandall Davis Company\u2019s London House\nopened last year in River Oaks with all but two units presold. Up in the Woodlands, Howard Hughes had to temporarily suspend sales for its Ritz-Carlton project because demand was so high. When construction started, 69 percent of the project\u2019s 111 units were presold.\n",

The complaint against the development entity, TCH 500 Alton, was filed in Miami-Dade Circuit Court in August.\nThe trust led by Newman, a former portfolio manager at Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Management, paid $17.3 million for a penthouse in 2024, about a month after the 48-story Five Park was\ncompleted\n.\nHe tried to reserve a guest apartment and allegedly was told there\u2019s no such amenity at the tower and that the developers were listing the apartments for sale, the lawsuit claims. Newman is an author and a former portfolio manager of Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Management who focused on sovereign debt.\nCoconut Grove-based Terra, led by David Martin, and Miami-based GFO Investments, Galbut\u2019s family office, developed the\ncondo\nat 500 Alton Road in South Beach with 227 units.\nAs a prospective buyer, Newman was shown marketing materials including a fact sheet promising the guest suites, a mockup identifying nine guest suites on the fifth floor, and a condo declaration saying guest units are available to condo owners and tenants and the relatives, guests and invitees of condo owners, the lawsuit alleges.\nThe developers\u2019 joint venture declined to comment on the allegation.\nIn a court response to the complaint, the joint venture denied wrongdoing and said the short term guest suites aren\u2019t available yet but will be made available for any unit owner\u2019s use.\nFive Park is among the crop of recently completed South Florida condos that became a magnet for well-heeled buyers during the tri-county region\u2019s boom in recent years. In April, Daniel Krizek, a biotech fund manager at Citadel\u2019s Surveyor Capital, paid\n$19.5 million\nfor a Five Park penthouse.\nA limited liability company linked to waste management mogul Patrick Dovigi\u2019s Toronto-based GFL Environmental also bought a penthouse, paying\n$17.5 million\n.\n",

        "content": "A dispute between an investor and a special servicer continues to play out in court.\nInvestor 400 Capital sued Rialto Capital Advisors late last year, accusing the special servicer of improperly keeping a loan in special servicing. Now, Rialto has changed track, but 400 Capital says it doesn\u2019t go far enough.\nIt\u2019s a rare look into a fight between a commercial-backed mortgage securities investor and the nation\u2019s largest special servicer by volume. As of June, Rialto was the named special servicer on more than 5,000 loans with a total unpaid principal of more than $94 billion, according to Morningstar.\nAt the center of the court dispute is a $130 million loan \u2014 one connected to a Herald Square hotel and retail location. The loan landed in special servicing with Rialto in October. The borrower said it hasn\u2019t been able to get a refinancing loan to pay off its original debt before a January due date because of upcoming lease expirations.\nRialto ultimately struck a two-year deal with the borrower. The rub: the servicer calls it a forbearance agreement, but 400 Capital believes it to be a loan modification.\nThat difference in semantics matters to the investor. A loan modification would launch the loan out of special servicing. A forbearance agreement keeps it with Rialto. Staying in special servicing means certain fees for the borrower, as well as default interest, which the investor says benefits Rialto\u2019s but not certificateholders\u2019 interests.\n400 Capital\nfiled the suit in New York\njust before Christmas, seeking emergency action. The company hoped the court would stop Rialto from executing an agreement wherein it would collect millions in default interest before investors got paid out.\nBut Rialto changed the terms of that agreement and then executed it before the court could look into the matter.\nNow 400 Capital has withdrawn its motion for immediate relief, but isn\u2019t abandoning the suit entirely.\nThe investor says Rialto got caught with its hand in the cookie jar, which led to the last-minute change. Rialto has now agreed to get paid on the back end of the loan instead of up front. But the new agreement still keeps the loan in special servicing, meaning a 25 basis point fee paid to Rialto and default interest that piles up to be paid to Rialto once the loan is closed. That adds up to more for the borrower to pay and more for it to borrow.\n\u201cThe refinancing gap is only growing as a result of this agreement,\u201d said Quinn Barton, head of CMBS and CRE at 400 Capital. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing here is making it even more difficult for the borrower to repay the loan.\u201d\nRacking up interests and fees on a performing loan, 400 Capital says, hurts investors by making it less likely the loan will be paid off.\nAnd the loan is indeed performing, the investor argues. Net operating income is more than double its debt service payments, the property is fully leased and has about $6 million in annual excess cash flow.\n\u201cIt would be common for a loan to get a 30-day, 60-day, 90-day forbearance. Even up to a year might be common in our industry,\u201d said Catie McKee of 400 Capital. \u201cBut in this case it just seems very obvious that they have found this loophole where if they call it a forbearance they can keep it in special servicing and keep this whole fee scheme going.\u201d\nRialto, through its investment affiliate Rialto Capital Management, is the country\u2019s largest buyer of CMBS B-piece notes. Those notes give the investor the ability to select the special servicer on the loan, including selecting its own affiliate.\nRialto, for its part, says it\u2019s better for everyone to keep this loan in special servicing. That allows investors to foreclose on the property faster and streamline other remedies in the event of another default. It also allows for easier administration of the full cash sweep the borrower agreed to.\nAnd the default interest that\u2019s accruing incentivizes the borrower to pay off the loan as soon as possible.\n\u201cRialto won\u2019t get paid a dollar of default interest unless everybody else gets paid in full,\u201d Greg Cross, an attorney at Venable who is representing Rialto in the suit, said in a statement. \u201cAnd to the extent they get paid it will come from the borrower, just like any other fee in this transaction.\u201d\nThe 25 basis point fee that Rialto gets paid as an active special servicer would typically be paid by the trust, but in this case Rialto negotiated for it to be paid by the borrower.\nIn court, Rialto is seeking to have the case dismissed, arguing that 400 Capital doesn\u2019t have standing to pursue it. The investor is contractually obligated to bring complaints to its trustee before initiating a lawsuit and 400 Capital did not do that, Cross said in a memo to the court.\n",

The 423,000-square-foot office building would be condensed into 336,000 square feet thanks to design work by Rawlings Architects.\nFeatures of the conversion would include a basement fitness studio, a restaurant and a doctor\u2019s office on the first floor, as well as co-working space, bike storage and a pool on the seventh floor.\nBroad Street\u2019s vice president of operations and construction Ryan Bird filed the permits for the project, which was first reported by\nPincusCo\n.\nOffice tenants at the building include cannabis startup LeafLink and co-working company Regus. One tenant that probably won\u2019t need much convincing to relocate? Broad Street itself, which has its headquarters there.\nBroad Street bought the building in 2014 for $175 million. In December 2017, ownership\nsecured a $102 million mortgage\non the property, courtesy of AIG Investments.\nThe mortgage was issued about a month after Invesco purchased a 95 percent stake in the building from Broad Street for\n$235 million\n. Broad Street retained a 5 percent stake in the tower and continued to manage the property.\nIn 2021, PCCP\nissued \u200b\u200ba $150 million loan\nto refinance the building, shortly after a $9 million capital improvement project that included upgrades to the hallways, restrooms and lobby.\nManhattan\u2019s Financial District, long the money capital of the city, has become a mecca for conversions since the pandemic. Just this month, Samuel Fisch of Blue Fin Equities moved to\nconvert\nthe 28-story building at 40 Fulton Street, planning to build 169 units after acquiring control of the property via a 2022 $88.9 million ground lease with Fulton &amp; Pearl, an affiliate of prominent investor David Werner.\nIn the first eight months of 2025, more than 4 million square feet of office space in the borough was converted to residential use, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield, exceeding the totals for each of the preceding two full years.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "When Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Management makes an investment, it usually means a company, or in certain cases, a country, is in really bad shape.\nThe $76 billion hedge fund is best known for its distressed investments in Argentina\u2019s bonds, resulting in a 15-year legal battle and leading the country to default on its debt. It waged war against Procter &amp; Gamble in the early 2000s over their attempt to takeover the German shampoo company Wella. It took control of the Italian soccer club AC Milan after the previous owner defaulted on its debt.\nBut the firm\u2019s most recent buy may not be such a bad thing for the downtrodden office market.\nElliott and Mukang Cho\u2019s Morning Calm Management recently closed on the acquisition of an obscure REIT in a deal valued at $1.1 billion.\nThe company, City Office, is an oddity. It\u2019s headquartered in Vancouver and has employees there, but has no properties in Canada. Instead, it bought humdrum office buildings in the Sun Belt. It controlled 4.2 million square feet of office space, commanding a modest $34.89 in gross rent per square foot. Its stock price has been underwhelming, reaching a high of $21 in 2022. In the end, shareholders received just $7 per share, a 26 percent premium from its last day of trading.\nBut Elliott\u2019s move to acquire City Office (surely a winner of the most creative office company name contest) may be an early tell in the post-Covid real estate landscape: investors are circling again, a sign the market may finally be scraping the bottom.\nIndustry insiders have long predicted that big-money investors like Elliott would acquire troubled public real estate companies and take them private, betting on a mismatch between office landlords\u2019 stock prices and the underlying value of their assets in a market that had sharply discounted the sector.\nRecently, there have been a few notable deals. Rithm Capital bought Paramount Group, a troubled office landlord in NYC and San Francisco, led by a CEO who fancied lavish expenditures and lunches at Le Bernardin, in a $1.6 billion deal.\nOthers appear to be lining up. Franklin Street, a Massachusetts-based office REIT with 4.8 million square feet of office space in the Mountain West and the Sunbelt, is seeking suitors as its stock price fell beneath $1. Phoenix-based Orion Properties, which owns 8 million square feet of office, is exploring a sale after stopping a takeover attempt by Kawa Capital.\nResuscitating REITs is not for the faint of heart. The maneuvers take time, burn capital and leave little room for error.\n\u201cA potential buyer has to make the determination that, even with the share premium he will likely need to pay, the juice is worth the squeeze,\u201d said Mukang Cho, whose firm purchased CIty Office REIT with Elliott Management. \u201cMy sense is many buyers might see value [in taking REITs private], but are hesitant \u2013 somewhat understandably \u2013 to then take the next step,\u201d he said.\nStill, the opportunity is tempting. Let\u2019s look at Rithm\u2019s acquisition of Paramount.\nAccording to Rithm, Paramount\u2019s stock was trading at 40 percent discount to its book value. Furthermore, the $1.6 billion deal was a fraction of the $6.6 billion that Paramount valued its real estate at. By that math, Paramount sold for a song.\nRithm believes its acquisition could result in an impressive 20x internal rate of return.\nParamount\u2019s office towers may not be the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of NYC office stock, but they are 85 percent leased and commanding $90 per square foot. That\u2019s not exactly distressed pricing.\n\u201cThe overall entry point on the underlying assets at what we think are very, very attractive values,\u201d said Rithm CEO Michael Nierenberg in a call with analysts explaining the move.\nThe firm\u2019s executives also pointed to NYC\u2019s office market resurgence.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no new construction, 10 percent of the inventory is coming offline with the conversions. And the return to work phenomenon is back now 4 to 5 days a week,\u201d said another Rithm exec on the call.\nOf course, not all office market recoveries are experiencing the same upswing as NYC. The nationwide vacancy rate remains around 20 percent. Finding a deep-pocketed investor like Elliott or Rithm willing to write the checks required to pull off these deals remains difficult, and there are only a handful of office REITs trading.\nBut the job of the office landlord has vastly\nevolved\n. In NYC, if you bought in the core business district, made sure the lobbies and bathrooms were clean, you could land tenants. Many of these landlords weren\u2019t operators, they were investors who saw office as their investment vehicle. That\u2019s changed. Tenants are picky and seek out buildings with critical amenities like podcasting rooms or signature scents. Or maybe driving range simulators for those junior analysts who need to work on their short game.\nFor investors that can buy at a low enough basis, and put in the money to upgrade buildings, and hold on long enough to catch the market\u2019s resurgence, there\u2019s at least a chance of an outsized return.\n",

        "content": "A New York-based distressed mall buyer is expanding its Chicago office holdings, taking control of a Loop office building through a deed in lieu of foreclosure after scooping up its debt at a steep discount.\nA venture of\nKohan Retail Investment Group\nlate last week took title to the 28-story building at 33 West Monroe Street, wresting the property from an affiliate of New York-based AmTrust RE. Crain\u2019s\nreported\nthat Kohan CEO Mike Kohan confirmed the move, which followed the firm\u2019s purchase of a $60 million loan backed by the building last fall.\nThe 900,000-square-foot building, at the southeast corner of Monroe and Dearborn streets, is the latest prominent downtown office property to change hands via distress. Rather than slug it out in court, AmTrust\nhanded over the keys\n, a route increasingly favored by owners and lenders looking to avoid long foreclosure battles, according to the publication.\nKohan\ntook its first step toward ownership in November, when it bought the mortgage from a venture of Des Moines-based Principal Life Insurance. AmTrust had secured the debt in a 2011 refinancing, according to Cook County records. While Kohan declined to disclose what it paid for the loan, the outlet noted that the brokerage Transwestern reported in October that it was under contract for about $25 million.\nGreat Neck, New York-based Kohan, best known as a buyer of troubled malls and shopping centers, isn\u2019t an obvious office landlord. But Kohan told the outlet that the company plans to use its low cost to lure tenants with aggressive rents.\n\u201cWe are looking for tenants that didn\u2019t have the opportunity to be part of [the building at 33 West Monroe] to come forward,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will make a deal.\u201d\nThe building is about 44 percent leased, according to CoStar, well below the downtown average of roughly 72 percent. Built in 1981, it was once the headquarters of Arthur Andersen before the accounting firm\u2019s collapse in the early 2000s.\nThe Monroe Street acquisition follows Kohan\u2019s bargain buy last year of the 65-story tower at 311 South Wacker Drive for $45 million, a sliver of the $302 million that building fetched in 2014.\nFor AmTrust, the handoff adds to a rough stretch in Chicago. The firm has already lost the building at\n30 North LaSalle Street\nto foreclosure and is battling a foreclosure lawsuit tied to its $260 million Illinois Center mortgage. It has also flirted with surrendering the building at 135 South LaSalle Street before pivoting to an office-to-apartment plan under the city\u2019s LaSalle Street Reimagined program.\nWith high interest rates, sagging values and loans coming due, more Loop owners are facing similar choices. Just last month, Chicago-based Nuveen took control of the building at 321 North Clark Street to resolve a troubled loan.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "What began as a corruption case about favors for developers is veering into darker territory for Ingrid Lewis-Martin, once Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 closest political ally.\nCourt filings from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg allege Lewis-Martin accepted diamond earrings and other perks from developers while pressuring the Department of Buildings to push through hotel and nightlife projects, The City\nreported\n, even as senior DOB officials warned of unresolved safety issues.\nThe filings suggest her interventions may have overridden concerns about fire egress and occupancy at a Lower East Side hotel and a rooftop bar project.\nThe documents were filed Tuesday as prosecutors responded to motions by Lewis-Martin\u2019s lawyers seeking to dismiss the case. They add fresh allegations to two existing indictments that accuse Lewis-Martin of bribery and money laundering, alleging she abused her position as the mayor\u2019s chief advisor to make regulatory problems disappear for politically connected developers.\nAmong the latest claims, prosecutors say Lewis-Martin accepted a pair of two-carat diamond earrings worth about $3,000 from\ndevelopers Raizada \u201cPinky\u201d Vaid and Mayank Dwivedi\nat the start of the Adams administration. In return, she allegedly leaned on city agencies to fast-track approvals for projects including the Hotel Rivington and a rooftop bar called the Glass Ceiling.\nPotentially more explosive for City Hall and the real estate industry is the allegation that DOB officials internally raised red flags about safety. A top buildings official warned that the hotel renovation Lewis-Martin was pushing forward lacked critical information about occupancy load and whether the building had adequate fire egress, according to the filings.\nDespite those concerns, Lewis-Martin repeatedly pressed then-acting DOB Commissioner Kazimir Vilenchik to move the project along.\nEmails cited by prosecutors show DOB staff expressing unease that Lewis-Martin was trying to \u201ccircumvent the process.\u201d In one instance, after Lewis-Martin texted that a project needed to be moved forward, a new plan examiner was assigned within an hour. Permits soon followed.\nLewis-Martin resigned in December 2024, days before her\nfirst indictment was unsealed\n.\nProsecutors accused her of\nsteering $100,000\nfrom the same developers into a joint account she shared with her son, funds later used to buy a Porsche. Other alleged benefits include cash, free catering at Gracie Mansion events and a speaking role on the TV series \u201cGodfather of Harlem,\u201d tied to a separate scheme involving pressure on DOT over a contested bike lane.\nHer attorney, Arthur Aidala, dismissed Bragg\u2019s latest filing as overreach, calling it a \u201cdesperate\u201d response.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The pandemic-era slowdown in productions and 2023 actors\u2019 and writers\u2019 strikes, along with the increasing costs of production in Los Angeles, have driven away productions. Shoot days fell 16 percent last year compared to 2024, according to a forthcoming FilmLA report for 2025 cited by the Times.\nThe declining figures are a fall from grace from just a few years ago. In 2021, independent studio owner Hackman Capital Partners and Square Mile Capital Management bought Radford Studio Center in Studio City for nearly $1.9 billion. The owners defaulted on their $1.1 billion mortgage earlier this month, and lender Goldman Sachs is\nexpected to seize control\nof the studio lot.\nSome studio owners are hopeful that the state\u2019s expanded film tax credits, which grew last year to $750 million from $330 million, will be helpful in stimulating production growth and creating some \u201cgreen shoots\u201d for the industry, as Wainwright said. \u201cI would like to think that 2024 and 2025 are kind of the bottom and that we\u2019re going to be pulling ourselves up,\u201d he told the Times.\nIn the meantime, studio developers like East End have been improvising by\nlooking to adaptive reuse\nas a way of increasing studio space without initiating new construction projects. East End\u2019s new downtown campus is partially built at a former cold-storage facility, and Amazon turned buildings in downtown Culver City into its Culver Studios facility.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A national data center land developer is making a big first move into the Chicago region, scooping up hundreds of acres of farmland in Grundy County for a power-hungry campus that would rank among the largest in the Midwest.\nAn affiliate of Denver-based Tract acquired a 343-acre site off I-80 in Morris, Illinois, paying about $51.5 million to an affiliate of Clarius Partners, according to public records. Bisnow\nreported\nthat the property sits roughly 50 miles from Midway Airport and about 65 miles southwest of downtown Chicago, firmly in exurban territory but close enough to tap the region\u2019s fiber and power backbone.\nTract\nplans to develop the land into the Morris Technology Park, a 2.9 million-square-foot data center campus designed to support up to 1 gigawatt of power load. Initial energization is targeted for June 2028, with the full load ramping up by 2032, the company said in a press release.\nThe project has been several years in the making and required close coordination with the city of Morris, Commonwealth Edison and the Illinois Economic Development Corporation, according to Tract President Graham Williams. The work includes a transmission security agreement with ComEd, a critical step for any hyperscale-scale development, according to the statement.\nTract\u2019s business model is to buy raw land, lock down zoning and entitlements and then build out heavy infrastructure \u2014 power, fiber, roads, water and sewer \u2014 before selling sites to hyperscalers or other data center developers. The company typically spends between $100 million and $150 million per site to get land ready, Mayor Chris Brown told local station WCSJ last year, often courting tenants like Amazon, Google and Microsoft.\nCity officials approved the infrastructure plan last year, with most local leaders confident the grid could handle the demand. Supporters have pointed to improvements in data center efficiency and relatively low traffic impacts. Still, the project hasn\u2019t been without controversy. Morris Alderman Alex Clubb voted against it, raising concerns about water usage and the potential need for a new water facility that the city might have to help fund.\nBrown later said the city is in \u201cgood shape\u201d on water and is considering construction of a larger facility to support long-term growth.\nThe deal marks Tract\u2019s first Chicago-area play, adding the region to a national portfolio that includes more than 25 gigawatts of planned capacity across 25,000 acres in markets like\nArizona\n,\nTexas\n, Virginia and Iowa. Tract estimates the Morris campus would generate more than 1,000 construction jobs and about 350 permanent positions \u2014 a sizable boost for a city of roughly 14,600 people.\nThe Morris announcement outside of Chicagoland comes as suburban Chicago debates how much\ndata center development\nit wants.\nBarrington Hills Village officials announced on Monday that Brennan Investment Group withdrew its proposed $2 billion data center campus in Barrington Hills following \u201cnegative early feedback\u201d from village officials and organized community opposition, canceling a Feb. 2 public hearing.\nLast week, Naperville officials killed a far smaller 145,000-square-foot proposal from Karis Critical, citing concerns over power availability and long-term economic tradeoffs, and Lisle officials paused a proposed data center after residents packed Village Hall with objections.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Silva &amp; Associates is aiming to break ground this summer on a three-story, 42,400-square-foot office building at the intersection of Beltway 8 and U.S. Highway 288, pending city permits,\naccording\nto the Houston Business Journal. The building, dubbed \u201cLawplex,\u201d would rise on a 1.9-acre parcel the firm bought in February 2024 between a Holiday Inn Express &amp; Suites and Bombshells Restaurant &amp; Bar.\nJ.D. Silva launched just five years ago with two lawyers and two other employees. Today, it employs about 60 people, including 11 attorneys, said Ernest Rojas, the firm\u2019s director of corporate services.\nThe law firm initially planned to develop the building with Houston-based Z-Co, but that partnership fell apart. J.D. Silva is now working with Powers Brown Architecture, another Houston firm, and is currently soliciting bids for a general contractor, the outlet reported.\nDesign-wise, Lawplex is meant to stand out in\nPearland\n. Plans call for glass walls, staggered floor plates with the largest floor on top, a rooftop patio and a centrally located staircase that lights up at night. That modern look required some back-and-forth with city officials, Rojas told the publication, because it departs sharply from the area\u2019s more conventional suburban architecture.\nConstruction is expected to take 12 to 14 months. Once complete, J.D. Silva plans to occupy roughly 30,000 square feet of the building, leasing out the first floor to office or retail tenants.\nThe firm currently leases about 10,000 square feet in a building at 9307 Broadway Street that already bears its name, and has added smaller outposts in Angleton in Brazoria County and McAllen in the Rio Grande Valley as its caseload has expanded, according to the publication.\nThe future site puts the firm directly across Highway 288 from a nearly 100-acre tract that has repeatedly teased a massive mixed-use future. Houston-based\nNewQuest\nabandoned a $350 million development\nplanned\nthere in 2023, the second time a developer has walked away from the property.\n\u201cThe 288 corridor is getting denser, better demographics and more rooftops,\u201d\nPearland\nEconomic Development Corporation President Matt Buchanan told the Business Journal last year.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The facility at 619 West 14th Street is owned by Elevate Research Properties, a subsidiary of Taconic Partners.\nThe asking rent and length of lease were not disclosed; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai signed a lease two years ago for 10,000 square feet, when the asking rent was $100 per square foot.\nThat\u2019s slightly below today\u2019s rates. In the third quarter, the average asking rent for life sciences space across New York City was $105.40 per square foot, according to CBRE.\nIn a statement, the president of Jackson noted the importance of being in \u201cclose proximity to leading academic medical centers, industry partners and patients.\u201d\nJackson recently acquired the New York Stem Cell Foundation. Prior to the lease execution, which took place in late October, the space was leased to the NYSCF.\nTaconic purchased the 10-story office building at the site \u2014 formerly known as The Movie Lab Building because of Warner Bros. Pictures\u2019 occupancy \u2014 for $112 million in 2012. Five years later, Silverstein Properties\nbought a majority stake\n, valuing the property at more than $180 million, while Taconic retained a 10 percent interest.\nThe partners invested $20 million to revamp the building, aiming to bring in research and pharmaceutical tenants. The property represented Silverstein\u2019s first life sciences project.\nIn 2020, Silverstein and Taconic refinanced the property with $205 million from Affinius Capital, then known as Square Mile Capital.\nBut in 2023, Silverstein tapped Eastdil Secured\u2019s Gary Phillips and Will Silverman to\nmarket its interest\nin the Hudson Research Center. A buyer had the opportunity to either recapitalize and join up with Taconic or purchase the property outright in a fee simple sale.\nA few weeks ago, Affiinius acquired the stake from Silverstein, valuing the property at $191.7 million, according to\nPincusCo\n.

It brings his total spend on the 3.7-acre assemblage to $58.3 million.\nJonathan Potsma with Coldwell Banker Realty represented the buyer and seller.\nFlancbaum is the head of New Jersey-based custom homebuilder Colts Neck Associates, which has developed homes in Marlboro, Colts Neck, North Howell, Brick, Manalapan, Millstone and Toms River, all in New Jersey. Susan Rizzuto is the daughter of Leandro P. Rizzuto, the late billionaire co-founder of hair products maker Conair. He was worth $3.5 billion when he died in 2017, according to Forbes.\nShe is a trustee of her father\u2019s namesake foundation along with her siblings, Leandro Rizzuto Jr., Denis Rizzuto and Babe Rizzuto. In 2024, Leandro Rizzuto Jr. bought a home in Boca Raton\u2019s Royal Palm Yacht &amp; Country Club for\n$18.5 million\n.

In 2021, they sold a Boca Raton mansion for\n$22 million\n.\nTarrant is the widow of early healthcare tech mogul Richard Tarrant. He sold his firm, IDX Systems, to GE Healthcare for $1.2 billion in 2005, according to published reports. The couple bought the Hillsboro Mile mansion for $3 million in 1998, property records show. The 11,000-square-foot house includes eight bedrooms, eight bathrooms, five half-bathrooms, 200 feet of oceanfront and 200 feet of Intracoastal Waterway frontage with a dock, the listing shows.\nDeborah Tarrant downsized to a home in Royal Palm Yacht &amp; Country Club for $8.4 million in November, records show.The sale marks the latest uber-expensive home sale in Hillsboro Beach, a sleepy stretch of coast just north of Pompano Beach. Earlier this month, car dealer Craig Zinn bought a waterfront mansion in the area for\n$27 million\n. In August, former Advanta CEO Dennis Alter sold his oceanfront mansion for\n$27.1 million\n.",

        "content": "Chicagoland\u2019s most expensive home listing took a $2.5 million price cut this week, more than a year after it first hit the market.\nThe 15,000-square-foot mansion at 595 Circle Lane in Lake Forest, on the grounds of a historic estate, had its price cut to $25 million on Tuesday. The six-bedroom, nine bathroom estate was listed at\n$27.5 million in September 2024\n, and has been on and off the market a few times at the same price.\nEven with the 9 percent price cut, the home remains the priciest active listing in the Chicago metro area, surpassing an $18.5 million Gold Coast mansion on Dearborn Street. The asking price would make it easily the most expensive home ever sold in Lake Forest.\nThe Italianate-style mansion sits on a 5.3-acre lot with 570 feet of Lake Michigan frontage and includes a boathouse, swimming pool and spa. The property also has a garage complex with space for 22 cars.\nThe home is owned by Terry Rozdolsky, according to property records. Rozdolsky founded Lake Forest-based Harbortown Industries, a wholesale supplier of picture frames for retailers like Walmart and Target.\nRozdolsky purchased the site in 2010 for $4.5 million, property records show. He built the current mansion in 2019 after tearing down the existing home. Rozdolsky paid about $171,000 in property taxes in 2025, county records show.\nAnn Lyon, the @properties agent representing the seller, did not respond to a request for comment.\nOne of the estate\u2019s unique features is a grand staircase descending the bluff to the lake, a remnant of the Villa Turicum estate that once occupied the site.\nThe 269-acre Villa Turicum estate was established in the early 20th century by Harold McCormick\u00a0 \u2014 son of International Harvester founder Cyrus McCormick \u2014 and Edith Rockefeller McCormick, the daughter of John D. Rockefeller. The opulent 44-room home, designed by architect Charles Platt, fell into disrepair after Rockefeller McCormick\u2019s death in 1932, and it was eventually demolished, with the land split up into 161 separate lots.\nThe latest price cut comes after North Shore homes reached unprecedented price levels in 2025. Two homes in Winnetka each\nsold for more than $30 million last fall\n, marking the most expensive home resales in Illinois history.\nLake Forest has seen some eight-figure deals recently, as well. An 11,800-square-foot mansion sold for $11 million in October. The home was sold by the\nestate of Posy Krehbiel\n, a Lake Forest socialite and philanthropist and the ex-wife of John Krehbiel Jr., the co-chairman of electronics company Molex.\nIn 2022, the\nwidow of filmmaker John Hughes\nsold a Lake Forest home for nearly $13 million.\nIn Chicago, other luxury homes cut prices this month, as the downtown market continues to adjust after a long downturn. A duplex condo at 950 North Michigan Avenue was relisted on Monday at $5.5 million after previously asking $6 million. The 9,000-square-foot home hit the market in September and is being marketed by Ryan Preuett and Tim Salm of Jameson Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.\nAt the St. Regis Chicago at 363 East Wacker Drive, a 4,700-square-foot unit, also listed by Preuett, took a $450,000 price cut in early January. The owner is now asking $6 million for the condo.\n",

        "content": "A judge rejected\na bid by SL Green and RXR\nto stop a UCC sale tied to Worldwide Plaza, clearing the way for Extell to move ahead with a foreclosure auction.\nJudge Andrea Masley denied the landlords\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction that would have blocked a UCC foreclosure sale of the mezzanine loan secured by the 49-story office tower at 825 Eighth Avenue, according to a decision issued on Tuesday in state Supreme Court.\nThe dispute pits three of New York\u2019s biggest real estate players against one another: SL Green\u2019s Marc Holliday, RXR\u2019s Scott Rechler and Extell\u2019s Gary Barnett. SL Green and RXR are the current owners of Worldwide Plaza. Extell, meanwhile, quietly acquired the senior mezzanine debt on the 1.8 million-square-foot office complex this fall.\n\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed in the most recent ruling, however, we still own and control the asset and we believe we will ultimately reach a resolution with the mezz lender which meets all parties\u2019 objectives,\u201d an SL Green spokesperson said.\nThe ruling came after the landlords sued to block the sale, arguing it was a \u201csham\u201d designed to wrest control of the Midtown property without a fair, competitive process. The firms claimed the proposed auction was structured to chill bidding and steer the asset to Barnett.\nExtell\npushed back hard\nagainst the allegations, calling RXR and SL Green\u2019s lawsuit meritless and accusing the two developers of trying to derail a sale they have known about for months. Barnett\u2019s camp argued in a legal filing that the mezzanine lender is within its rights to foreclose after a default and that the auction was properly noticed and structured.\nThe judge ultimately sided with Barnett, emphasizing in her ruling that contracts must generally be enforced, especially when negotiated by \u201csophisticated, counseled businesspeople,\u201d even if market conditions have changed since the deal was struck.\nGoldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank provided $190 million of senior mezzanine debt in 2017 that was later transferred to Korea-based Shinhan Financial Group, which sold it to Extell.\nWorldwide Plaza has been a prime example of the office market\u2019s continued distress. Control of the mezzanine debt would give the winning bidder significant leverage over the property\u2019s future.\nThe property is backed\nby $940 million in senior CMBS debt\nthat\nwent to special servicing\nin September 2024 after law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore vacated 617,000 square feet, leaving Worldwide Plaza about 40 percent vacant. The landlords defaulted on both senior and mezzanine debt in July, per public filings.\nExtell is the only qualified bidder lined up for the auction, but Masley said that does not render the sale commercially unreasonable.\n\u201cOur position on Worldwide Plaza has long been clear \u2014 while we moved the asset into our Alternative Strategy Portfolio over two years ago given that we attribute little to no value to the asset, we have a plan to revitalize the building and the capital to execute it,\u201d the SL Green spokesperson said.\nAn Extell representative declined to comment. RXR did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "Anthony Donato is fast becoming the\nbaron of Bannockburn\nthrough purchases of troubled real estate.\nThe resident of the wealthy suburban Chicago enclave in the North Shore paid $20 million this week to buy the 114-acre former Trinity International University campus, he confirmed to\nThe Real Deal\n. It marks a significant discount from a previous deal\nTexas real estate titan Ross Perot Jr. eyed\nfor the property before backing away.\nDonato and his wife Anna\u2019s nonprofit foundation acquired the sprawling North Shore site featuring 26 buildings just months after another of his ventures snapped up the nearby Bannockburn Lakes office park for $17 million. The office park\u2019s price amounted to a painful haircut for the sellers, Chicago-based\ncommercial real estate heavy hitters Walton Street Capital and Glenstar\n, after they spent $43 million between 2015 and last year buying and upgrading the property.\nPerot Jr.\u2019s Dallas-based firm, Hillwood, had considered buying the Trinity property for years, with plans to pay about $35 million for most of the land and embark upon commercial redevelopment that could have brought industrial, office, lab or other corporate uses to the campus.\nAccording to a person familiar with the deal, Hillwood was interested in redeveloping the land for Takeda Pharmaceuticals, which has a large office space in an adjacent Bannockburn property. But Hillwood walked away after sensing community resistance to the plan, and\nTakeda this month opted to expand a separate lease\nit has in a Libertyville corporate campus by about 80,000 square feet.\nAfter shuttering its residential and in-person education operations in Bannockburn in recent years, Trinity was still in a rush to find a buyer. The school had a $16 million bridge loan against the property it took out in late 2024 from Connecticut-based lender JGB Management.\nThe Donatos leveraged their home field advantage to secure the site in a sprint, closing the deal in just seven weeks. They financed the purchase with a bank loan, they said, but declined to name the lender or the loan amount. Hillwood declined to comment.\nUnlike Hillwood\u2019s commercial ambitions, the Donatos pitch a vision that might be more well-received by village residents: a massive youth and amateur sports complex. The centerpiece will be a 300,000-square-foot to 400,000-square-foot indoor arena they are planning to build to replace the campus\u2019 Meyer Sports Complex. It will feature multiple basketball courts, volleyball and indoor soccer facilities, and perhaps an ice arena for hockey and other skating-based competition. The property already includes full-size outdoor football, baseball and softball fields the Donatos intend to use as part of their programming. They said they expect the addition to cost another $40 million to $50 million and think they could break ground within 18 months, while preparing to gain village approval for the project.\nThey also want to bring other entertainment concepts to the property, such as golf simulators and perhaps mini-golf, arcades, escape rooms and more, and see opportunities to host summer camps and corporate retreats that could make use of the property\u2019s commercial kitchen and cafeteria that can feed 1,000 people per meal.\nThey\u2019re toying with the idea of building a higher-end hotel on the property, as well, and capitalizing on the property\u2019s proximity to multiple major highways by adding retail uses, such as restaurants and shops that would be fueled by traffic from families and athletes attending sporting events.\n\u201cWe could truly hold a tournament here every weekend,\u201d Anna Donato said. Their oldest of three children, an 11-year-old daughter, has also given them a list with dozens of ideas for the property, they said. They hope to have sports leagues running at the property as soon as this spring.\nThe Donatos previously expressed interest in buying at least a portion of the Trinity campus for their vision, but were unable to make a deal while Hillwood was still in the mix. The couple purchased the Bannockburn Lakes office complex in July with plans to turn some of that five-building campus spanning 530,000 square feet of interior space into an athletics-focused complex. Now, one of the Bannockburn Lakes buildings will be converted into self-storage or temperature-controlled storage uses. The Donatos are also trying to lease up much of the vacant office space at the property, hiring JLL last year to market it to potential tenants.\n\u201cThere\u2019s endless things you could put here,\u201d Anthony Donato said of the Trinity property. \u201cAll the sports-oriented stuff, I call that the anchor that drives its own version of traffic, where you\u2019re going to have thousands of kids come every weekend.\u201d\nHe found success in the solar power development field while also gaining some experience with multifamily and retail real estate. The Bannockburn Lakes and Trinity deals are his largest office and development plays, however.\nThe couple\u2019s plan coincidentally could have some synergy with the\nChicago Red Stars\n. The professional women\u2019s soccer team earlier this month announced plans to build a $30 million-plus training performance center on an adjacent Bannockburn parcel, creating a de facto sports district in the suburb. The Donatos weren\u2019t aware the Red Stars were keen on the area when they put out their offer for Trinity.\nTrinity International confirmed the sale to a \u201cprivate real estate investment entity\u201d in a statement, but declined to comment on the religious school\u2019s financial situation. Trinity controlled the property for over 60 years, but faced declining enrollment in suburban Chicago, and last year announced it was merging with Trinity Western University in British Columbia, Canada. Its shutdown of most of the campus \u2014 with several buildings that have stayed open, including its library and chapel \u2014 was originally planned in 2023.\nFor Donato, the deal cements a rapid accumulation of more than 150 acres of prime North Shore land at bargain-basement pricing. By targeting property that institutional capital has either fled or failed to unlock, he\u2019s betting as a local operator, he can navigate the zoning and political dynamics that scared off out-of-towners.\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with the village to get permission to do everything,\u201d Anthony Donato said. \u201cBig goals to hit the ground running as fast as we can.\u201d\n",

The unpaid debt for the three office buildings totals $442.1 million, according to filings cited by the Mercury News. The original loan Deutsche Bank provided to Starwood totaled $364.5 million, per Alameda County real estate records.\nStarwood bought the office buildings in 2019 for a total of $494 million. At the time, the purchase was seen as a vote of confidence in the Oakland office market. The Covid-19 pandemic that broke out the following year sent\noffice values\nin San Francisco and across the Bay Area spiraling, leading to bargain-basement sales and foreclosures in the region.\nWhen Starwood bought the buildings, the\noffice vacancy rate in downtown Oakland\nwas approximately 7.5 percent, according to a Colliers report cited by the Mercury News. Today, nearly six years after the outbreak of the pandemic, the vacancy rate has not gotten close to recovering. In the fourth quarter of last year, the office vacancy rate in downtown Oakland was 28.5 percent, according to Colliers.\nThe 2101 Webster building rises 20 stories and spans 473,000 square feet. The 1901 Harrison structure is 17 stories tall with 285,000 square feet, and 2100 Franklin is 10 stories with 217,000 square feet. The three office buildings total 975,000 square feet, according to the Mercury News. Because the properties are on separate parcels, the Deutsche Bank affiliate could offload the buildings in individual transactions should it choose to sell them.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A Silicon Valley\nquantum computing\ncompany will move its headquarters to Boca Raton, bolstering Palm Beach County boosters\u2019 drive to turn the area into a hub for tech firms.\nD-Wave Quantum, now based in Palo Alto, California, will open its headquarters and a research and development facility by year\u2019s end at the Boca Raton Innovation Campus, according to news releases from the tenant and landlords. D-Wave leased about 25,000 square feet, according to a CP Group spokesperson.\nFounded in 1999 and taken public in 2022, D-Wave provides dual-platform quantum computing. Alan Baratz is CEO.\nD-Wave signed a $20 million agreement with Florida Atlantic University for the school to purchase an Advantage2 annealing quantum computer, and to have it installed at its Boca Raton campus. After the deal was announced Tuesday, D-Wave\u2019s stock rose 1.6 percent, Investor\u2019s Business Daily\nreported\n.\nAlso on Tuesday, D-Wave announced a collaboration with Davidson Technologies and defense tech firm Anduril Industries to develop quantum applications for U.S. air and missile defense.\nBoca Raton-based CP Group and New York-based DRA Advisors own the 1.7 million-square-foot Boca Raton Innovation Campus, or\nBRiC\n, at 5000 T-Rex Avenue. The campus was developed in the 1960s by IBM for its research and development.\nDRA, led by David Luski, paid\n$320.2 million\nfor a stake in BRiC in 2021. CP Group is led by Angelo Bianco and Chris Eachus.\nThe firms recently completed a $100 million capital improvement of the campus.\nD-Wave\u2019s move from Silicon Valley to Boca Raton boosts the narrative that South Florida has a growing tech industry supporting real estate leasing. The excitement picked up at the onset of the pandemic when Silicon Valley firms rushed to the tri-county region, which had reopened for business and hosted the 2020 bitcoin conference. At the time, much of the industry excitement was over Miami\u2019s Wynwood, which was a magnet for the techies.\nAs a whole, data showed the influx of tech companies\ndidn\u2019t translate\nto hefty office leasing in South Florida. And over the past three years, some of the South Florida firms moved back to Silicon Valley, especially since the area is considered the biggest ecosystem for AI, the latest fad in tech.\nBut over the past year, there\u2019s been a renewed push to grow the tech industry but in a different South Florida area: Palm Beach County, and especially the city of West Palm Beach. The drive is\nled by billionaire Steve Ross\nand other executives at Related Ross, the West Palm-based real estate firm Ross founded in 2024.\nAt Related Ross\u2019 23-story 10 City Place building, under construction in downtown West Palm, Fortune 500 cloud computing firm ServiceNow pre-leased\n211,900 square feet\n. It marked last year\u2019s\ntop\nSouth Florida office lease.\u00a0Vanderbilt University is expected to start construction soon for its\n$520 million\nWest Palm campus that will offer business and tech graduate programs. Ross and other real estate heavyweights played a pivotal role in helping bring the Nashville-based university to West Palm, with Ross committing $50 million in April, hosting fundraisers and advocating publicly for the campus.\n",

The\nEklund Weekly Luxury Report Los Angeles\n, compiled by the team\u2019s Marcy Roth, counts Los Angeles County homes listed in the Multiple Listing Service for $4 million or more.\nThe estate is currently asking $12.9 million, or $1,381 per square foot.\nBuilt in 1913, the\nhome\nwas designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument, with its ties to Los Angeles Times owners Norman Chandler and Dorothy Buffum Chandler. The Chandlers, who bought the property in 1950, referred to the home as \u201cLos Tiempos,\u201d or The Times in Spanish.\nIts other name as the \u201cWestern White House\u201d comes from the parade of presidents \u2014 including Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon \u2014 along with diplomats and other high-profile individuals welcomed as guests at the estate. The Los Angeles Music Center, which includes the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, in Downtown Los Angeles was built with the help of fundraisers held at the Hancock Park residence.\nChristie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\u2019s Shahryar Bastani and Beverly and Company\u2019s Shiva Rafizadeh hold the listing.\nCurrent sellers, Nigerian furniture manufacturer Robert Oshodin and his wife Mimie Oshodin, acquired the property for $9.5 million in 2014 to, according to property records. About two years later they\nmarketed the home for $50 million\nfollowing several renovations.\nFit for entertaining, the Beaux Arts-style home has six bedrooms, eight bathrooms, music room, guest house and wine cellar. It sits on nearly 1 acre.\nLast week\u2019s second-largest home to go into contract, based on asking price, was 1150 Stone Canyon Road in Bel-Air.\nThe property, which sits above the Hotel Bel-Air, is priced at just under $8 million, or $1,525 per square foot. With an over 3-acre lot, it\u2019s being marketed for its development possibility.\nThe lot currently holds an over 5,000-square-foot home with six beds and six baths.\nCompass\u2019 Sally Forster Jones holds the listing.\nRecords show the property owner is a trust tied to the artist Vivian Angelini.\nOverall, Los Angeles County was mostly quiet last week when it came to dealmaking with a dozen homes entering into contract, equating to a little over $75 million in asking volume, according to the Eklund Gomes\nreport\n. That\u2019s off about 75 percent from the year-ago total volume.\n",

The new offices will be in the southern annex on a block that once was home to the headquarters of the Los Angeles Times and known as Times-Mirror Square.\nGSA\u2019s space spans a number of floors in Onni Group\u2019s 145 South Spring Street, and the largest federal defender office in the U.S. will move into the space in the first quarter of 2027.\nThe GSA liked the property \u201cdue to its proximity to courthouses, landlord\u2019s ability to fund and perform tenant improvements, and overall competitive economics on the lease,\u201d JLL\u2019s Peter Hajimihalis said. Lease details weren\u2019t immediately available.\nHajimihalis and JLL colleagues James Malone, Dana Vargas and Howard Traul represented Onni in the deal along with Onni Group\u2019s in-house leasing team of Neal Linthicum and Malcolm Kluth. Timothy Pavek at Carpenter/Robbins Commercial Real Estate worked on behalf of GSA.\nFederal Public Defenders Central District of California will be relocating from 321 East 2nd Street in the Little Tokyo part of DTLA.\nDeveloper Onni Group, headquartered in Vancouver, acquired the 10-story, 243,749-square-foot 145 South Spring Street in September 2016 for $105 million, per property records. The structure is a historical part of the Times-Mirror Square four-building office complex. The building was integral to the LA Times\u2019 operations for 70 years until the company relocated in 2018.\nThe publication has a small fraction of the staff and revenue it commanded at its heights. It sold off Times-Mirror Square under prior ownership and now is located in El Segundo at a building in the portfolio of current owner Patrick Soon-Shiong.\nOnni has been investing in Downtown L.A. in recent years,\nerecting Olympic + Hill\nrental tower with 685 units and 45,000 square feet of amenity space at 230 West Olympic Boulevard.\nIts other DTLA office assets include two buildings in South Park: the 12-story, 159,561-square-foot 315 West 9th Street and the five-story, 69,700-square-foot 1212 South Flower Street.

The company has grown rapidly since going public in June 2020: It now has 32,000 agents, almost triple its agent base of 12,000 that it\nreported\nat the end of 2023.

The team completed over $163 million in volume that year with an average home price of $702,000.\nKeller Williams has recognized Paige Martin as a top five individual agent in the franchise. She also chairs the Houston Association of Realtors MLS Committee.\nBob Martin cited Real Brokerage\u2019s focus on technology as a draw for the Houston Properties Team, according to the press release.\nNeither Paige Martin nor Real Brokerage immediately responded to a request for comment.\nThe team\u2019s move takes place as established companies weigh the benefits of branding and resources against independence. While the Compass/Anywhere merger consolidated\nsome of the top brands in Texas\nunder one company, others have doubled down on local management.\nKeller Williams recently lost the Jorgenson Group, a Central Texas team that opted to go independent earlier this month.

Business First reported. The company will occupy 9,480 square feet at 811 West 7th Street once it moves operations from its office in\nVenice\nat 215 Rose Avenue. The firm\u2019s headquarters are in Oakland and opted to\nrebrand\nfrom Guayak\u00ed last May to Yerba Madre, or \u201cMother Herb,\u201d to reflect \u201ca deepened commitment to people and planet, and the ancestral roots of yerba mate,\u201d the company said.\nThe Fine Arts Building was built in 1926 and spans 115,902 square feet across 13 stories. The structure was designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1974.\nYerba Madre\u2019s \u201cdecision to relocate from Venice to Downtown Los Angeles reflects the area\u2019s strengthening market fundamentals and the growing appeal of occupying creative space in a truly distinctive environment,\u201d said NAI Capital Commercial\u2019s Gibran Begum, who represented Fine Arts Building landlord Manchester Capital Management in the lease transaction.\nRecent office sales in Downtown Los Angeles indicate the market might have a long way to go before reaching pre-pandemic levels.\nNew York-based investment company 601W has emerged as a buyer for a distressed office tower on Bunker Hill in downtown Los Angeles. The Brookfield-owned Wells Fargo Center\u2019s North Tower, rising 54 stories and spanning 1.4 million square feet, is reportedly set to trade hands for $180 million,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported. That price works out to about $130 per square foot. Last month, another distressed\nBrookfield\n-owned downtown office tower, the\nBank of America Plaza\n, hit the market. The 57-story tower was last appraised at $212.5 million, or about $150 per square foot, in 2024 \u2014 a stark contrast from its $605 million value a decade ago.\nOther office deals that signal a possible positive trend in the downtown market seem to be few and far between.\nLast month, L.A. Metro bought the 106,004-square-foot office building at 500 South Santa Fe Avenue in the Arts District from SteelWave for $45 million. The $450 per-square-foot sales price dwarfs the downtown office average of $240 per square foot and the $342 per square foot average across Greater Los Angeles.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The portal is designed to cut down on the time it takes for developers to begin construction on\nstate-owned surplus property\n, according to the California Department of General Services.\n\u201cBy modernizing how we engage with developers, California is unlocking new opportunities for job creation and economic growth,\u201d Ana Lasso, director of the Department of General Services, said. \u201cThis portal ensures that state land is put to its best use while supporting diverse and emerging developers across the state.\u201d\nThrough the portal, developers can submit proposals to the Department of General Services, which the agency then evaluates according to the state\u2019s goals for the sites, which \u201cinclude successful implementation of the plan, financial return to the state and local regional impact,\u201d a department spokesperson told the Bee. Once a plan is approved, the developer would be responsible for building what they proposed if they\u2019re chosen.\nThe administration of\nGov. Gavin Newsom\nhas been working to turn government properties into affordable housing or other commercial properties. When Newsom first took office in 2019, one of his first announcements was a proposal to address California\u2019s need for more affordable housing by converting state property\nto residences\n. Last year, Newsom said his administration had 32 projects in \u201cvarious phases of development\u201d that would eventually result in nearly 4,300 housing units.\nLast November, state officials announced six new projects across California where more than 800 new homes will be built on state land. The new portal lets developers peruse the state\u2019s commercial opportunities.\nAs of Monday, 19 state properties were listed for possible commercial development, according to the Bee. Of the 19, 15 are available for proposal and one is already under agreement. Under the new program, developers will deal with simpler submission requirements and the Department of General Services can review proposals on a rolling basis, permitting projects to advance more quickly.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A year after succumbing to a massive loss on the sale of a marquee Chicago River office building, Sterling Bay is looking to offload a parking garage across the street as a potential apartment development site.\nThe Chicago-based developer hired JLL to market the five-story parking structure at 530 West Chicago Avenue, pitching the site as an apartment development opportunity amid intensifying interest along the river, according to a marketing brochure. JLL broker Dan Reynolds is representing the seller, CoStar\nreported\n.\nThe garage sits just north of the Loop and spans about 30,725 square feet. JLL is advertising the site as suitable for a mid-rise or high-rise apartment project with as many as 400 units, depending on how much density a buyer can unlock through zoning and negotiations with neighboring owners.\nSterling Bay\nbought the garage in August 2018 for $15.5 million, Cook County records show. The decision to sell comes almost exactly a year after the firm unloaded the hulking office building at\n600 West Chicago Avenue\nfor about $88.7 million \u2014 a steep discount from the roughly $510 million it paid in early 2018 for the 1.6 million-square-foot\nformer Montgomery Ward warehouse\n, according to CoStar and public records.\nThe garage sale price will likely hinge on development rights. Under an existing reciprocal easement agreement with the adjacent garage at 811 North Larrabee Street \u2014 now owned by Arizona-based 3Edgewood after its purchase of the 600 West Chicago building \u2014 a buyer could build a 67-unit apartment building as-of-right. JLL\u2019s marketing materials note that changes to that agreement could allow a 175-unit tower under current zoning, while further negotiations could clear the way for a building with up to 400 apartments.\nAny project at 530 West Chicago Avenue would land in a rapidly transforming pocket of River North. Bally\u2019s casino is rising just across the river, while Onni Group is planning thousands of apartments nearby on and around a former Greyhound bus facility at the south end of Goose Island.\nThe listing also highlights the continued reshaping of Sterling Bay\u2019s portfolio after losing control of the\nLincoln Yards\nmegadevelopment and putting other properties in Fulton Market and near Lincoln Yards on the block.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Nearly two years after the condo board at a Chicago high-rise terminated an agreement to sell their building to deconversion specialists Strategic Properties of North America, the firm came back with another offer \u2014 and was met with a resounding no.\nAfter buying dozens of condos in the 310-unit building in the Loop, SPNA offered $95 million to purchase all of the remaining units in a bulk sale in 2022. The Lakewood, New Jersey-based company, led by Saul Kupperwasser and Yitzy Klor, has made a name for itself in the high-stakes business of converting condo buildings into rental apartments.\nUnit owners at 200 North Dearborn Street initially agreed to the bulk sale to SPNA, but the firm failed to secure the financing necessary to close the deal, and condo owners were left in limbo for over two years. While the sale was pending, they were barred from selling their units individually, according to their agreement.\nThe condo board voted to terminate the contract in May 2024.\nWhen news of the second offer spread this week, the condo building\u2019s Facebook page lit up with condo owners criticizing SPNA.\n\u201cThis is absolutely ridiculous. We cannot seriously go through this again,\u201d one member of the Facebook page wrote.\nThe deal was swiftly shot down.\nThe 200 North Dearborn condo board voted 4-0 to reject the offer, condo president Jonathan Taylor confirmed to\nThe Real Deal\n, though he declined to disclose the amount offered.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t as good as the offer that we were under contract for last time,\u201d he said.\nAccording to the condo board\u2019s bylaws, the board was tasked with evaluating the likelihood that fellow condo owners would support the offer in a building-wide vote. If the board was confident that the offer could get some traction, regardless of board members\u2019 individual opinions on the potential deal, they would agree to pay attorneys to draft a contract to present to all the condo owners for a vote, Taylor said. But after evaluating the terms of the offer, the board agreed it was likely to fail.\n\u201cWhat is wrong with them?\u201d another commenter on the Facebook page said, referring to SPNA. \u201cIf there are people who want to sell their units, do it when they get a good price \u2026. Leave the rest of us out of this slimy deconversion deal.\u201d\nKupperwasser and Klor did not respond to requests for comment.\nSPNA has successfully converted condo buildings in Chicago to rentals in the past. The cyclical business thrives when the condo market is oversupplied, and rent is on the rise.\nYet, since 2020, SPNA has fumbled three Chicago conversion deals, including the two offers to buy all the remaining units at 200 North Dearborn Street.\nThe third failed deal was\na $190 million offer\nto buy a River North condo building called Ontario Place. Initially, the building\u2019s condo board also agreed to the bulk sale. But after SPNA failed repeatedly over three years to secure the funding necessary to close the purchase, the board backed out of the deal. At the time, one condo owner called the waiting game, \u201chell for the past three years.\u201d\nAfter SPNA\u2019s first offer to buy all the units at 200 North Dearborn, tension escalated between condo owners who wanted to sell to SPNA and those who wanted to cut ties with the company, resulting in\na contentious condo board election\nin late 2023.\nIt also spurred\na lawsuit from\nTaylor, who alleged that SPNA had committed consumer fraud by making an offer it couldn\u2019t support. The case is currently pending in Illinois appeals court.\nSPNA\u2019s failed condo deconversions aren\u2019t the only setbacks the firm is facing.\nAttorneys for Chicago-based Byline Bank this month\nfiled a foreclosure complaint against SPNA\nfor a promissory note that has allegedly been in default since August.\nByline alleges that the bank issued a $496,000 note to Kupperwasser and Klor in 2017, but in August they stopped making payments. Byline alleges the duo currently owe $340,000 on the loan.\nAround the same time that the pair took out the promissory note, they also secured a $397,000 mortgage from Byline on their one-story, 5,400-square-foot Illinois office property at 5009 Oakton Street in Skokie.\nByline is now requesting that a judge order a judicial sale of the building to pay back the note.\nSPNA also recently sold a converted apartment building in Chicago at a loss, while listing another for sale.\nLaramar Group bought SPNA\u2019s Wave Lakeview apartments for $57 million last month. SPNA last refinanced the property for $62 million in 2019, public records show. SPNA had converted the nearly 60-year-old building from condos to apartments in 2017 and took out a $46 million loan from Ladder Capital to help fund the deconversion, according to public records.\nIt\u2019s unclear how much total capital SPNA put into the deconversion of the 30-story, 207-unit Wave Lakeview at 420 West Belmont Avenue, or if the company paid down the principal on its latest $62 million note from MF1 before selling the property.\nIn October, the company\nalso listed the K Square Apartments\nin Lincoln Park. SPNA converted the 22-story, 268-unit property from condos to rentals in 2018, and listed the building for sale in 2023 with CBRE, before eventually taking it off the market. It is now listed with Berkadia brokers Nick Harris, Pete Evans and Richard Evans.",

        "content": "A federal civil rights investigation launched by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development into whether Texas state officials steered federal disaster relief grants to whiter, wealthier areas is now over.\nHUD\nclosed the case\ninvestigating the Texas General Land Office\u2019s practices in its distribution of disaster funding, according to a press release Wednesday from HUD. According to the agency, HUD\u2019s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity found that the Texas GLO did not engage in racial discrimination when making grant awards.\nThe move is the latest in a tug-of-war on policy spanning across three presidential terms to the present day. Former President Joe Biden\nreinstated a fair housing rule\nthat was scrapped by the Trump administration during his first term.\n\u201cThe Biden administration politicized enforcement of federal civil rights law and deprived rural communities of essential disaster mitigation funds,\u201d HUD Secretary\nScott Turner\nsaid in a statement. Turner was a Plano, Texas-based pastor prior to his confirmation in February for the HUD secretary chair.\nThe findings contradict the initial 2022 probe, which found that Texas didn\u2019t allocate any of the $1 billion in federal funds it received to protect communities from future disasters to any of the high-risk neighborhoods in Houston that experience regular flooding, as previously reported in\nThe Real Deal,\nwith the agency going on to state that excluding Black and Hispanic communities was discriminatory.\nThe focus on Houston began with Hurricane Harvey recovery efforts in 2017 and several costly storms in the following years that inundated the city. No other state adopted Texas\u2019 method of distributing the funds, according to the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity under the prior administration. Without Texas\u2019 discriminatory criteria, nearly four times as many Black residents and more than twice as many Hispanic residents would have benefited from the grants, according to the agency.\nThe state denied claims of discrimination and appealed HUD\u2019s findings, arguing that the Texas General Land Office administered the federal grant program based on HUD approval. The state pointed out that its plan was approved two years ago and even called HUD\u2019s objections \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201d\nTurner agreed, publishing an op-ed in the magazine National Review Jan. 19, outlining a new rule proposed by the agency to drop use of \u201cdisparate-impact theory\u201d in fair housing cases. According to a Library of Congress definition published in 2025,\ndisparate-impact\ndiscrimination is identified \u201cwhen a seemingly neutral policy or action causes a disproportionate and unjustified negative harm to a group, regardless of intent.\u201d\nHUD\u2019s statement reiterated that in the Texas GLO case, the state agency effectively used a race-neutral competition standard for disaster mitigation projects.\n",

        "content": "It\u2019s not the\nworst landlords\nlist. It\u2019s the\nworst\nlandlords list.\nWhat makes this annual hit piece by Public Advocate Jumaane Williams so bad? To begin with, not everyone on the list is a landlord.\nSome of them are\nreceivers\n\u2014 people appointed by a judge to rescue violation-ridden buildings. People like Joe Cafiero.\nThis is supposed to be a list of villains, but Cafiero is anything but. He arrives at a property with a pile of money from the lender, which is trying to protect its collateral, gets to know the residents and spends what it takes to fix what\u2019s broken.\n\u201cI walk every building,\u201d he said. \u201cTenants know my name. They have my cell number. They love me. We\u2019re doing what the owner didn\u2019t do. We\u2019re making it habitable again.\u201d\nWhen Cafiero is handed control of a building, it might have six or eight violations per unit. Violations are the basis of the public advocate\u2019s notorious list. But instead of shaming the owner who did not fix the problems, Williams\u2019 list blames people trying to do exactly that.\nThe list deemed Cafiero the landlord of\n19 distressed buildings\n. A random check of one, 1202 Spofford Avenue in the Bronx, showed it actually belonged to Isaac Kassirer, who famously assembled a huge rent-stabilized portfolio only to see the 2019 rent reform\ndestroy his business plan\n.\nThe building\u2019s $14.7 million mortgage included two other buildings, both assigned to Cafiero by a judge. The\nthree Kassirer properties\ntotal 106 units and 961 HPD violations, which Williams\u2019 list laid at the feet of Cafiero. Rather than using ACRIS, the city\u2019s property records database, the public advocate linked to\nJustFix.org\n, which partners with\ntenant organizing groups\n.\nDistress rising\nAs various factors pushed apartment buildings into\nfinancial straits\n, business skyrocketed for Cafiero, who has been at his firm, Cremac,\nsince 1994\n.\n\u201cWe take over two to four buildings a week,\u201d he said. \u201cLast year it was one every month, or every other month.\u201d\nAs a result, his ranking on the worst list of landlords shot up. No good deed goes unpunished.\n\u201cI was [No.] 24 last year; I\u2019m up to 4,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s only because the volume of foreclosures has increased.\u201d\nThat, and the fact that the public advocate does not bother to differentiate between landlords and receivers.\nSometimes, as in the case of distinguished former judge\nAriel Belen\n, No. 34 on the list, clicking through to the associated properties shows he is a receiver, not the owner. Williams apparently did not even do that rudimentary check.\nThe public advocate\u2019s staff goes through the motions of informing people in advance that they will make the list, but does not appear to listen to feedback.\n\u201cThey sent us a letter about two months ago,\u201d Cafiero said. \u201cI replied, told them we don\u2019t own [the buildings], that we\u2019re under receiver orders, but I guess it went ignored.\u201d\nProtests ignored\nCafiero said he even called the public advocate several times before the \u201cworst landlords\u201d list was released. But it generates more publicity than anything else the powerless office does, so each public advocate picks it up from the previous one. Before Jumaane Williams, there was Letitia James and the list\u2019s creator, Bill de Blasio.\n\u201cI\u2019m a New Yorker, I get it,\u201d Cafiero, a St. John\u2019s graduate, said of Williams. \u201cHe\u2019s grandstanding.\u201d\nWhen the list was released, media outlets started calling Cafiero, but no real estate publications did. They know better.\nThe Real Deal\nstopped covering the list years ago because it unfairly included owners who had just purchased troubled buildings and were in the process of fixing them up.\nNow it is increasingly roping in receivers because rent-stabilized buildings have been hit by a perfect storm:\nthe Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, which virtually banned deregulation and severely limited rent increases for improvements;\noperating expenses\noutpacing rent increases\nby the Rent Guidelines Board;\nrising interest rates starting in March 2022; and\na\ndecline in rent collection\ntriggered by the pandemic.\nThe \u201cworst landlords\u201d list is supposed to shame owners who squeeze profits from their buildings by not spending enough on maintenance. But it does not differentiate between them and owners who try hard to maintain properties, even if they lose money in the process.\nBecause of the rent laws, regulations and the dysfunction of housing court, the ownership costs of fully rent-stabilized buildings often exceed their revenue. Even mission-driven nonprofits that don\u2019t have to pay property tax are struggling at some properties.\n\u201cI\u2019ve literally lost $1.5 million for the honor of being a \u2018worst landlord,\u2019\u201d one member of the list said. \u201cIf I had to have the indignity of being on the list, I\u2019d at least want to make a buck.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Gabriel Barbier-Mueller\u2019s Harwood International sold off another office building, amid a wave of\nsales\nand\nforeclosures\nat the firm\u2019s signature Uptown district.\nHarwood offloaded Harwood No. 3 to San Francisco-based private equity firm TPG on Dec. 1, deed records show. It\u2019s the fifth property\nHarwood sold to TPG\nin the last six months.\nHarwood No. 3, at 2727 North Harwood Street, was built in 1999. It\u2019s anchored by law firm Jones Day, which occupies 133,000 square feet of the 210,000-square-foot office building. Jones Day was supposed to anchor the upcoming Harwood No. 15, with plans to move into a\n73,000-square-foot block\n, but\npulled out of the project\nlate last year.\nAfter tapping Newmark to\nhunt for a recapitalization partner\n, Harwood sold four buildings to TPG last fall: Harwood No. 2, at 2728 North Harwood Street; Harwood No. 6 (also known as Saint Ann Court), at 2501 North Harwood Street; Harwood No. 7 (also known as Frost Tower), at 2950 North Harwood Street; and Harwood No. 10, at 2850 North Harwood Street.\nThe sales to TPG coincide with a spate of foreclosures in the district that resulted in Harwood losing two office buildings.\nHarwood handed back the keys to\nHarwood No. 4\nin April and lost\nHarwood No. 1\nin November. San Francisco-based Spear Street Capital took back Harwood No. 4, at 2828 North Harwood Street, in a $73 million credit bid.\nFirst United Bank seized\nHarwood\u2019s first development, at 2651 North Harwood Street, with a $27 million credit bid. Bill Cawley\u2019s\nCawley Partners bought the property\non Dec. 30.\nHarwood\nnearly lost Harwood No.6\nto foreclosure in January, but saved the building, known as Saint Ann Court, with a recapitalization deal.\nThe financial unraveling of Harwood is at odds with the health of the office market in Uptown. Though Dallas-Fort Worth continues to struggle with\nhigh vacancy rates\n, Uptown has been a reliable outlier. With a high concentration of trophy office properties, the sought-after submarket accounts for nearly half of the region\u2019s office pipeline. Consequently, it also boasts the highest rents of any submarket in Dallas-Fort Worth, with an overall average gross rent of $62.21 per square foot, according to a recent report from Partners Real Estate.\n",

In 2016, his team ranked first in\nThe Real Deal\n\u2019s annual broker rankings after closing over\n$720 million\nin sell-side deals. The team claims over $5.2 billion in sales since its inception, CEO Bess Freedman wrote in an announcement about the move.\nThe team works on both resale and new development projects. Past projects have included 108 Leonard, 111 Murray and 150 Charles. Recent noteworthy deals have included resales in those buildings, including a penthouse at\n111 Murray\nsold for $28 million in July and a condo at 150 Charles that sold for roughly $16 million this month.\nDe Niro\u2019s team also has the listing on another penthouse at 111 Murray asking over $33 million.\nHe also worked with his father, actor Robert De Niro, on expanding the family\u2019s real estate holdings. The younger De Niro was a partner and helped open the boutique Greenwich Hotel in Tribeca in 2008, and has been a part of the expansion of the upscale restaurant Nobu. Last year, the De Niros opened their\n775,000-square-foot production studio\nin Queens.\nDe Niro said in a statement he felt \u201cit was time to take my business in a new and different direction\u201d after 20 years at Elliman.\n\u201cWe are proud of the agent Raphael became with Elliman and wish him nothing but the best in his next endeavor,\u201d a spokesperson for Elliman said in a statement.\nDe Niro is the latest in a long line of big-name Elliman agents who have left the firm.\nEarlier this month,\nLindsay Barton Barrett\n, one of the top brokers in Brooklyn, brought her four-person team to Compass. Top-producing teammates\nNoble Black\nand\nGlenn Davis\nparted ways with Elliman and each other last fall when Black left for Corcoran and Davis headed to Serhant.\nThe moves come as Elliman shuffles senior staff as well. The brokerage parted ways this month with its\nhead of residential leasing\n, Hal Gavzie, and last month, it laid off\nfour senior employees\n, including two members of its new development marketing arm.\nThe high-profile agents from Elliman have largely landed at Compass and Corcoran, but De Niro will be joining a fellow Elliman veteran at BHS. New York City agent\nJessica Cohen\nleft the firm in April after roughly 20 years for BHS.\n",

El-Ad also assumed a $4.5 million mortgage with a 2028 maturity date.\nEl-Ad\npaid more than double the sale price from three years ago. The seller, an entity managed by Luis Navas in Fort Lauderdale, paid $7.7 million in 2023, records show. Last year, North Bay Village city officials approved a transfer of development rights from the 7922 East Drive lot to the other two lots. El-Ad has not disclosed plans for the three lots.\nIn May, El-Ad bought a 1-acre vacant parcel at 7913 West Drive for\n$20 million\nfrom Aventura-based S2 Development. In 2023, North Bay Village approved S2 Development\u2019s plan for Marina View tower, a 22-story tower with 94 residential units as condos or apartments.\nEl-Ad, a division of New York-based Elad Group, has built 12,222 apartments and condo units in the Southeast, including 4,370 in Florida, according to the firm\u2019s website.\nIn Davie, El-Ad is planning a\n$1 billion\nmixed-use project. The 2.8 million-square-foot District in Davie will entail 1,256 apartments in five towers ranging from 20 stories to 24 stories, as well as 36,000 square feet of retail and restaurants, and 2,650 parking spaces.\nNorth Bay Village is a hotbed for high-rise development.\nAlirio Torrealba\u2019s Coral Gables-based MG Developer and Miami-based Prosper Group filed plans last month for a 30-story tower with 147 condo units at 1681 and\n1725 North Bay Causeway\n. The joint venture paid\n$30.9 million\nfor the 1-acre site last year.\nCoconut Grove-based Related Group and New York-based Macklowe Properties are planning a two-tower condo project with 364 units at 8000 East Drive and 7946 East Drive that could be branded as\nRitz-Carlton\n.",

        "content": "JEMB Realty is forging ahead with its revival of a Midtown shopping corridor, convincing TJ Maxx to sign its first new lease in Manhattan in a decade.\nThe big-box retailer agreed to lease 40,000 square feet at Herald Towers in Herald Square, the New York Post\nreported\n. The store will occupy two floors of the property at 50 West 34th Street and is expected to open by the end of the year, representing the retailer\u2019s eighth Manhattan location.\nThe asking rent on the 10-year lease was a blended $4 million, according to the\nCommercial Observer\n. In the fourth quarter, the average ground-floor retail asking rent on West 34th Street was $405 per square foot, according to CBRE.\nJEMB\u2019s Jacob Jerome told the Observer that the deal reinforces \u201cthe corridor\u2019s role as one of the most important shopping districts in the country.\u201d\nRipco Real Estate\u2019s Richard Skulnik represented the tenant, while JEMB was represented in-house.\nThe lease brings occupancy at Herald Towers to 95 percent. Other tenants at the 110,000-square-foot property include Old Navy, MooMoo and IT Italian Trattoria.\nOld Navy, Gap Inc.\u2019s largest brand, agreed last spring to create a\n55,000-square-foot flagship\non the first and second floors of Herald Towers, the largest retail lease of the year in Manhattan at the time. The asking rent on the 15-year lease was not disclosed at the time.\nHerald Square has been slow to recover compared to other Manhattan retail corridors like SoHo and prime Fifth Avenue. The area along 34th Street between Fifth and Seventh avenues sported 21 ground-floor retail vacancies during the first quarter of last year, according to CBRE, the second-most among the 16 districts tracked by the brokerage.\nHerald Towers was once the McAlpin Hotel, but was rebranded after JEMB purchased the property in 1999 for $150 million. The property also includes 690 apartments, where a studio is asking $3,500 per month.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Long-stalled plans for nearly 1,000 residential units plus hotel rooms and commercial space near a West Palm Beach transit hub are back in motion.\nAttorneys for the developers behind the $1 billion Transit Village project are in discussions to settle the lawsuit against Palm Beach County over the sale price of the 6.6-acre county-owned site, avoiding a February trial, the Palm Beach Post\nreported\n.\nCourt filings point to Palm Beach County Administrator Joseph Abruzzo, appointed last year to the job, for helping thaw the stalemate over the sale. The opposing sides \u201cbegan working together in good faith to try to amicably resolve this matter,\u201d the developers\u2019 attorneys wrote in filings.\nThe Toledano family\u2019s Aventura-based BH Group, the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Coconut Grove-based Related Group and Michael Masanoff plan the 1.3 million-square-foot Transit Village at 150 Clearwater Drive in downtown West Palm. The project would rise atop a major city bus station and next to a transit hub for Tri-Rail and Amtrak trains and Greyhound buses.\nTransit Village had been in the works for 15 years when Masanoff won a city solicitation to redevelop the property. After stalling for years, it finally\npicked up momentum\nin 2021 when Related, BH and Sagi invested in the project.\nIn 2022, West Palm\napproved\nthe development with three 25-story buildings with 986 residential units, a fourth 25-story building with 108 hotel keys, and 180,000 square feet of offices. The project will include micro-units, workforce housing units, retail and an elevated podium.\nBut then Transit Village hit another hurdle when the developers\nsued\nthe county in 2024 over jacking up the site\u2019s price to $35.5 million, nearly 10 times more than the $3.6 million agreed on in 2012.\nIn court filings, the county said it wanted nearly $3 million in Federal Transit Administration grants repaid. But the county said the FTA wanted it repaid based on current property market values that put the amount owed for the grants at $35.5 million. Transit Village has argued the FTA never asked for the money back and the county contract never included a requirement to pay back the federal agency.\nReasons for previous delays prior to BH, Related and Sagi\u2019s investment are unclear. A source previously told\nThe Real Deal\nit had to do with numerous amendments to agreements with government agencies due to plan changes.\nAttorneys for the developers and a county spokesperson declined to comment to the outlet.\nA settlement would require approval at a public county meeting.\n\u2013\u2013\nLidia Dinkova\n",

The asking price was later reduced to $7.8 million before being taken off the market in October, according to listing sites.\nMostame said after a relatively quiet 2025, he\u2019s seeing signs of \u201cactivity picking up\u201d and expects the property to trade before the summer now that buyers are back from their holiday travels.\nThe big jump in pricing from when the home last sold to London interior designer Julia Dempster is due to the extensive renovation it underwent. Dempster sought to retain the 1920s Spanish influence with the home\u2019s original arched doorways, stained glass windows and hand-painted ceilings, according to Mostame.\nIt sits on nearly a third of an acre and has six bedrooms and seven bathrooms across 5,906 square feet.\nThe residence was made a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1999, not only for its Spanish Colonial Revival architecture, but its high-profile ownership lineage. That most recently came with Barker\u2019s purchase of the property in 1969. However, it was also once owned by former\nLos Angeles Times\nPublisher Harrison Gray Otis and later Charles Toberman, who is credited with building out Hollywood via developments such as the Hollywood Bowl, Grauman\u2019s Chinese Theatre, El Capitan Theatre and the Roosevelt Hotel among other landmarks.\nToberman is also the developer of the\nOutpost Estates\nneighborhood, an exclusive community of less than 500 homes known for its Spanish and Mediterranean designs. It\u2019s bordered by Mulholland Drive and Runyon Canyon.\n",

The decision puts OYO on the hook for legal fees in the dispute, which could fall in the six-figure range when determined next week.\nThe judge pulled no punches in finding OYO in contempt for firing the property\u2019s manager and dozens of unionized employees, despite\nan order\nnot to do so.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know what more you could do to be in contempt. I really don\u2019t,\u201d New York state Supreme Court Judge Andrea Masley said. \u201cThis is contempt if I ever saw it.\u201d\nThe judge also admonished OYO for not adhering to a contract that dictated how the company and Highgate would go their separate ways.\nOYO did not respond to a request for comment about the contempt finding or the dispute with Highgate.\nIn early August, OYO allegedly blindsided the property manager Highgate with a notice canceling its contract, according to a lawsuit filed by Highgate. The cancellation attempt came four years ahead of schedule and included the citation of issues related to an entirely different property Highgate operates.\nThe 10-year management agreement entitled Highgate to a 3.25 percent cut of the 208-key hotel\u2019s gross revenue. OYO is supposed to provide working capital to the property, which Highgate described as \u201cwell-performing.\u201d\nOYO disagreed with Highgate\u2019s characterization of performance in the termination notice. The hotel owner said it plans to welcome a new property manager, though at the moment, that property manager appears to be OYO.\nTerminating Highgate\u2019s contract could be a way for OYO to cut expenses and boost earnings before an expected initial public offering.\nOYO,\nbacked by SoftBank\n, bought Motel 6 from Blackstone for $525 million and is preparing an IPO that could value the company at $8 billion.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Alexandria is expected to\nput its 88 Bluxome Street site in San Francisco on the market\nin the first half of the year. The company has also begun marketing sites near Stanford University in Palo Alto for housing and is expected to sell the land within the next year.\nAlexandria saw almost $1.9 billion in write-downs last year, marking a nearly tenfold increase from 2024. With heightened surplus supply across the Bay Area, many developers are shying away from building new life sciences projects after the pre-pandemic biotech boom. Vacancy is approximately 24 percent, according to Savills data cited by the Business Times.\nLeasing in the life sciences market is picking up steam and some demand remains, according to the Business Times. Alexandria executives believe\nrecovery is coming\n, but it isn\u2019t moving fast enough to absorb excess supply. Rather than bet on life sciences, buyers for surplus land are instead looking to acquire property at lower prices and plan for housing instead.\nAn increasing portion of Alexandria\u2019s land and aging properties are now being positioned for housing upon sale, Peter Moglia, Alexandria\u2019s CEO and CIO, said. Much of Alexandria\u2019s recent write-downs were linked to land, a direct result of oversupply in the Bay Area and other parts of the country, Marc Binda, Alexandria\u2019s CFO noted.\nSome Alexandria-owned land is being primed for housing without even selling. Last month, Strada Investment Group unveiled a\nproposal to demolish\nfour office buildings on Alexandria-owned land in Palo Alto to make way for 145 residential units.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",
