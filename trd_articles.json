        "content": "K5 Equities added two Stamford apartment complexes to its portfolio in a $57.2 million deal.\nThe White Plains-based private equity real estate firm acquired Daycroft Apartments and Hamilton Gardens from Brooklyn\u2019s Hamilton Daycroft LLC, according to\nWestfair Communications\n. The firm paid $33.2 million for Daycroft and $24 million for Hamilton Gardens, both of which were appraised last year below the sale prices.\nThe deal for the combined properties breaks down to $304,000 per unit.\nThe seller behind the shell company is Ahron Rudich, principal of Empire Realty USA, according to the\nHartford Business Journal\n. Rudich faced pressure from residents to improve conditions at another Connecticut community he allegedly neglected, according to\nCT Insider\nreporting from last year.\nDaycroft, at 44-150 Blachley Road, spans eight buildings with 108 units across 104,000 square feet. Hamilton Gardens, at 333 Hamilton Avenue, includes four buildings with 80 units and 77,000 square feet. The properties were appraised at $23.7 million and $18.4 million, respectively, last year.\n\nK5 is led by Steve Kessner and his son Michael. The elder Kessner, a Bronx native, bought his first building in Manhattan in 1980 and amassed a 48-building portfolio he sold for $225 million in 2007. The firm has acquired nearly $400 million worth of commercial real estate assets in the New York metro, with a focus on value-add and repositioning strategies. The Stamford acquisitions fit that model, though K5 has not yet disclosed any plans for upgrades or redevelopment.\nThe deal adds 188 units to the firm\u2019s holdings and marks a continued push into suburban multifamily properties within its geographic footprint.\nRents have been soaring in Stamford and vacancy rates have remained below the national average. At the halfway point of the year, rents had increased for eight consecutive months in the city, according to\nCoStar\n.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Tao Group Hospitality and Vlad Doronin\u2019s OKO Group have dissolved their hospitality joint venture that planned a restaurant and private club at the 830 Brickell office tower in Miami,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nIn December, Miami-based OKO announced its\nMiami Members Hospitality joint venture\nwith Tao, stating the partnership\u2019s first venue would be a Mediterranean restaurant and club with a members-only lounge expected to open this year on the top two floors of the 830 Brickell office tower. In a news release at the time, Doronin said OKO and Tao \u201cwill craft an elevated experience that resonates with the district\u2019s dynamic spirit and sets a new standard for the city and beyond.\u201d\nAt some point after the announcement, the joint venture was dissolved, sources told\nTRD\n. OKO still plans to open a restaurant and lounge at 830 Brickell\u2019s top two floors, another source said.\nTao Group confirmed that the firm and OKO \u201cagreed to mutually part ways.\u201d OKO declined to comment.\nMiami-based OKO and London-based Cain International completed the 55-story\n830 Brickell\nlast fall at 830 Brickell Plaza in Miami, after a roughly two-year\ncompletion delay\n. It\u2019s the first new standalone office tower in the\nBrickell Financial District\nin over a decade.\n\nThe fully leased tower was under construction during the pandemic-induced influx of out-of-state companies to South Florida, leading to a preleasing bonanza at 830 Brickell. Tenants include wealth manager\nCorient\n, private equity firm\nThoma Bravo\n, law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis, Brazilian bank\nBanco Master\n, and Ken Griffin\u2019s\nCitadel and Citadel Securities\n.\nOver the past two years, new-to-market companies slowed their South Florida expansions, with some pulling the plug on planned offices. Financial services firm\nRothschild &amp; Co\n, which had leased 5,000 square feet at 830 Brickell in 2023, opted out of opening a Miami office. Law firm\nWinston &amp; Strawn,\nwhich also had preleased at 830 Brickell, opened an office at Southeast Financial Center in downtown Miami instead, citing the 830 Brickell construction delays.\nElsewhere in Miami, OKO and Cain are developing the 47-story, 135-unit Una Residences condo tower at 175 Southeast 25th Road in Brickell, and completed the 57-story, 249-unit Missoni Baia condo tower in Edgewater.\nTao Group, led by Noah Tepperberg and Jason Strauss, has a portfolio of restaurants, nightlife and daylife venues around the world. In South Florida, Tao has the Hakkasan Miami restaurant at Fontainebleau Miami Beach and, in partnership with Groot Hospitality, opened Casadonna restaurant in Miami\u2019s Edgewater. Tao is a subsidiary of Nicosia, Cyprus-based Mohari Hospitality.\nLast summer, OKO and Cain scored a\n$565 million\npermanent loan from Tyko Capital for 830 Brickell.\n",

        "content": "Lennar and its partners dusted off a three-year-old proposal for a megaproject on a 960-acre land tract outside of Miami-Dade County\u2019s Urban Development Boundary.\nMiami-based homebuilding giant Lennar and South Florida\u2019s Easton real estate family want to develop City Park with 7,800 for-sale and for-rent homes; 1.4 million square feet of commercial space; and 249 acres of open space, according to a pre-application they submitted to the county late last month. The site is between Southwest 136th and Southwest 152nd streets, and between Southwest 162nd and Krome avenues, near the Country Walk neighborhood in unincorporated Miami-Dade.\nDallas, Texas-based homebuilder Bill Albers also is partnering on the project, according to Ed Easton, the Easton family\u2019s patriarch and founder of Miami-based\nEaston Group\n.\nThe site consists of 11 lots primarily owned by Lennar, the Eastons, the Dallas investor and the Cheng family, according to records and Easton. Freight rail company CSX Transportation owns two lots. John C. Cheng Escartin is managing partner and international consultant for Panamanian tax, assurance and professional services firm HLB International, according to records. It has not been decided whether the Chengs will partner on the project or sell their properties to the developers, Easton said.\nA\nUDB\nexpansion is one of the most controversial proposals a developer can file in Miami-Dade, often drawing opposition from environmentalists and others seeking to stop suburban sprawl. Opponents often decry UDB expansions as development encroachment onto wetlands, open land that could be needed for preservation of Everglades National Park and Biscayne National Park, and farmland needed to meet the demand for produce.\nUDB\nexpansions require a super-majority vote by county commissioners, and often also face a mayor\u2019s veto and lawsuits.\nLennar and the Eastons first proposed City Park in 2022 and backed out of pursuing the project at the time.\n\n\u201cWe decided in the middle of it that it was not a good time to do it,\u201d Easton said, \u201cbecause we thought the housing market wasn\u2019t as much in need of something like this as it is today.\u201d\nSince then, South Florida\u2019s housing demand has grown, necessitating projects such as the City Park UDB expansion, Easton said, adding that Miami-Dade also struggles with a lack of developable land. Also, he said the City Park land has no environmental significance.\n\u201cSensible development on non-environmentally sensitive land like this one makes sense,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a need for more land for sensible development in Miami. This particular parcel does not have any environmental sensitivities.\u201d\nThe 2022 City Park concept book attached to the recent application depicts a somewhat self-supporting mixed-use development with its own schools, offices, retail and entertainment venues such as a lagoon or water park. The project would include the Village Core district with restaurants and entertainment, as well as a 10-acre farm.\nThe residences will include single-family homes, townhomes and apartments, according to the application. The project will include below-market rate homes, Easton said.\nThe developers are in the very first inning of the approval process, which could take until late next year or early 2027 to reach a final vote by commissioners, he said.\nThe last major proposal for UDB expansion was Coral Rock and Aligned Real Estate\u2019s South Dade Logistics &amp; Technology District on 379 acres. The developers won commission approval after five public hearings and survived Mayor Daniella Levine Cava\u2019s veto in 2022, but lost in court when a judge determined last year the county had\nmissed an approval deadline\n.\nLast month, a group of landowners, through their Herkoz and Alflo Sunset affiliates, proposed a\n64.8-acre UDB expansion\nfor a project with 1,200 single-family homes and apartments, and up to 90,000 square feet of retail. The site is on the northwest corner of Southwest 137th Avenue and Southwest 248th Street.\n",

The project is in the Logistics Campus, which is Dermody\u2019s redevelopment of the former Allstate headquarters at 3075 Sanders Road.\nDermody bought the 232-acre site for $232 million\nin 2022\n, with plans to build one of the largest urban logistics developments in the U.S. The 10-building, 3.2 million-square-foot complex will amount to a $500 million project, but finding tenants is taking some time.\nThe Pepsi facility is being built at the far southern end of the campus in the second phase of the development. The five-building first phase is mostly\nvacant\n. Four of those five buildings comprise 700,000 square feet up for lease.\nDental equipment manufacturer HuFriedyGroup leased one of the buildings, spanning 326,300 square feet, in March, though a target date for moving in has not been determined.\n\nThat lease followed an earlier agreement with California-based Upside Foods, which planned to build but then\npostponed\na 187,000-square-foot cultivated-meat facility at the campus, choosing to focus on its California operations instead.\nThe vacancy rate in greater Chicago\u2019s industrial market crept up 6.3 percent year-over-year in the second quarter, and construction was down 24 percent, according to Avison Young. The Pepsi warehouse is the only industrial project in development in Cook County, and its lease begins in February.\nOffice-to-industrial redevelopment, especially for data centers, is becoming a trend in the Chicago suburbs. Karis Critical, for example, is planning a\ntwo-building data-center complex\non the site of the former Alcatel\u2011Lucent office site in Naperville.\nAnd Compass Datacenters is redeveloping the 2.4 million-square-foot former Sears headquarters in Hoffman Estates into a data-center complex.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Two successive plant-based grocery stores preceded XMarket, going back to 2021.\nTrader Joe\u2019s has not confirmed any plans for an Uptown store, telling Block Club the chain is always on the lookout for\npotential locations\nand has been eyeing Chicago, specifically, for new opportunities.\n\nThe chain has six stores in Chicago, ranging from Roscoe Village to Hyde Park, and a dozen or so more in the suburbs.\nThe application for a liquor license suggests more than a passing interest in the Uptown location, and a Trader Joe\u2019s could provide a boost to the area\u2019s retail scene beyond the 6,500-square-foot space, providing an amenity for residents and stirring commerce on Montrose Avenue.\nIndeed, residents of various neighborhoods on the\nFar North Side\nhave publicly pined for a Trader Joe\u2019s, which appeared set for a store in nearby Andersonville before the deal fell through two years ago.\nResidents and business interests in West Ridge tried to sell Trader Joe\u2019s on a location on Western Avenue, a pitch that came in the early days of the pandemic. Trader Joe\u2019s passed on the location, which eventually landed Starbucks as an anchor for a new development.Trader Joe\u2019s is known for its eponymous private-label foods, as well as quirky marketing and relatively\nlow prices\n, given its foodie sensibilities. It operates coast-to-coast, with locations in 42 states.\n",

City staff approved the change because the east side is not the primary facade of the building.\n\nThe measure approving the concept passed the Historic Design and Review Commission without objection, but the panel did set some conditions for Innjoy to address going forward. The developer was encouraged to salvage any brick that is removed during renovations and keep it on-site as a resource for future repairs.\nInnjoy partner Adrian Ramirez previously told the outlet that the residential conversion proved to be the developer\u2019s most compelling option on a conversion.\nInnjoy bought the building in 2020 and considered remaking it into a hotel before settling on a residential plan.\nInnjoy is no stranger to the hotel business. It bought the State National Bank Building in downtown Houston in 2020 and converted it to a Moxy hotel, part of the Marriott stable of brands. That deal set off speculation that the developer would turn the Nix Building into a hotel, but plans submitted to the San Antonio Historic Design and Review Commission indicate it has stuck with the plan for apartments.\nNo timeline has been set for construction.\n",

        "content": "New York City\u2019s broker fee ban is\nwreaking havoc\non rental data.\nThe number of new rental listings uploaded to local listing services has dropped dramatically since the law, known as the FARE Act,\ntook effect\nin mid-June. The provision prohibits landlords from charging tenants fees for agents they hired and imposes fines up to $2,000 per violation.\nBetween June 11 and July 31, brokers added just 1,400 rental listings to the Residential Listing Service, Brooklyn MLS and similar agent-facing platforms, compared to 5,300 listings submitted during the same period last year, according to data from UrbanDigs. The total marked a 74 percent decline in new listings year-over-year.\n\u201cThis sharp decline suggests landlords are using other listing sources as they adjust to the new FARE Act requirements,\u201d UrbanDigs\u2019 co-founder John Walkup wrote in a statement.\nThe \u201ccollapse\u201d in rental listings on the RLS comes after a July report from StreetEasy found rental inventory on its platform had held steady in the month after the law\u2019s passage, excluding a temporary drop in listings immediately after the law took effect.\nThe day after the FARE Act\u2019s implementation, more than 1,000 listings\ndisappeared from StreetEasy\n. The company chalked the sudden dip up to those represented by rental agents who did not have an updated compensation agreement in place before the law\u2019s implementation.\n\u201cThe outflow of listings has since stabilized and followed usual seasonal trends associated with summertime leasing activity,\u201d the report states.\n\nHowever, the platform logged an 8 percent decline in rental inventory across the five boroughs last month compared to July 2024, according to its data dashboard. Manhattan notched the largest drop, with inventory falling more than 11 percent.\n\u201cThe FARE Act curbs brokers\u2019 ability to market nonexclusive listings, leading to a noticeable drop in inventory across platforms,\u201d REBNY\u2019s senior vice president of residential brokerage wrote in a statement. \u201cWith vacancy rates at historic lows, this reduced visibility makes an already competitive market even harder to navigate for everyday New Yorkers.\u201d\nThe Real Estate Board of New York requires its members to submit rental listings to the RLS if they have an exclusive agreement with the landlord.\nUnlike consumer-facing platforms such as StreetEasy and Zillow, the RLS limits who can upload their listings directly to the service, as it is designed to encourage co-broking between agents. The platform does not allow landlords or property managers who are not licensed brokers to submit their units.\nREBNY and others in the industry cautioned that the law could drive rental inventory down, as the provision assumes that brokers have exclusive agreements with landlords, making the landlords responsible for their compensation. Before the law, brokers were able to market listings to tenants without an exclusive agreement with the landlord and collect fees from tenants directly.\nA federal judge has\nrejected multiple bids\nfrom REBNY to halt the FARE Act\u2019s implementation while a lawsuit it filed against the City Council makes its way through the courts. REBNY has alleged that the provision violates the First Amendment.\nSome agents have said the law\u2019s implementation has created chaos. Market analytics firms reported inflated rents in the immediate aftermath of the law, and uncertainty over how to properly comply with the rules.\n\u201cBoy, is it confusing,\u201d said Donna Olshan of Olshan Realty. She added that finding accurate data on the rental market was already a tall order, but the fallout from the new law could likely make it worse. \u201cI don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to keep the data now.\u201d\n",

Only floors two through seven of the 24-story building will consist of office space.\nThe conversion is expected to start in 2026.\nSavanna bought the site for\n$28 million\nin 2014. About seven years later, the developer finally nabbed $264 million in construction financing, a major coup at the time given the lack of office demand during Covid. PIMCO provided the senior debt, and CarVal Investors added the mezzanine loan, according to the\nCommercial Observer\n.\n\nSavanna bet corporate tenants would trickle into Downtown Brooklyn. But since the tower\u2019s completion in 2023, it has remained vacant.\nSavanna defaulted on its senior loan and Joshua Zamir\u2019s Capstone swooped in to purchase the debt from PIMCO and BH3 Management pitched in equity,\nThe Promote\nreported. Capstone initiated a non-judicial\nforeclosure\n. An auction date was set for June.

Last year, it offloaded\n360 Lexington Avenue\nfor $65 million; it purchased the 270,000-square-foot office and retail property in 2019 for $180 million. Savanna also faced foreclosure last year at\n521 Fifth Avenue,\na 39-story, 460,000-square-foot office tower.\nNow, the firm is down another office building, and the property won\u2019t be solely office space for long.\n\u201c141 Willoughby Street presents a truly unique blank slate upon which to reimagine a newly developed institutional-grade asset,\u201d said Adam Falk of BH3 Management.\n",

The three-story property at\n230 West 11th Street\ntraded between two LLCs that hide the identities of the true parties in the transaction. The 25-foot-wide Italianate townhouse dates to 1860 and has three wood-burning fireplaces and a terrace. It has been fully gutted,\naccording to a Douglas Elliman listing\n.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nThe priciest commercial transaction recorded in the Big Apple was for $86 million in Downtown Brooklyn. A\nSavanna\naffiliate transferred all of its interest in an office building at\n141 Willoughby Street,\nalong with a neighboring parcel at\n383 Gold Street,\nto\nCapstone Equities\n, which had initiated a\nforeclosure action against the property\nin June\n.\nThe Class A office building stands 24 stories tall; Savanna completed construction on the property in 2022.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Carlos Saavedra\nand\nNicole Eckstrom\u2019s Eckstrom\nparted with a newly renovated, move-in-ready brownstone at\n51 Tompkins Place\nin Cobble Hill for $11.5 million \u2014 more than 134 percent more than its last trade price just two years ago. The buyer was an LLC. Brooklyn-based Eckstrom paid $4.9 million for the single-family home in 2023. The three-story property was built in 1899 and went on the market in April for $11.9 million. Saavedra and\nJorge Murillo\nwith Park Property Advisors listed the townhouse, and Douglas Elliman\u2019s\nLindsay Barton Barrett\nbrought the buyer.\n\n\ud83d\udcca Residential:\nAlso in Cobble Hill, a townhouse at\n219 Kane Street\nwith an attached garage was snapped up for $9.3 million. The sellers were\nChristopher and Kimberly Browne\n, and the buyers were\nHelga Locascio\nand\nMarco Locascio,\nvia a trust, and his wife\nEmily O\u2019Brien.\nThe home had been on and off the market for about a year, when it was first listed for sale in June 2024 for $11 million, according to\nRealtor.com.\nThe Brownes had owned the property since 2019, when they purchased it for $6.5 million. The Locascios recently sold a\nbrownstone in Park Slope for $6.5 million\n.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nIn Sunnyside, a two-story, more than 35,000-square-foot warehouse traded hands for $12 million. The seller of the property at\n41-39 39th Street\nwas a company linked to\nJoshua L. Goldman\nthat had owned the property for decades. The buyers were White Plains, New York-based\nOakland Trading Corp.\nand\n4141 Group LLC.\nThe deal works out to roughly $340 per square foot.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nA company tied to\nGregory Spatz\npicked up a four-story mixed-use property at\n385 Greenwich Street\nin Tribeca from an affiliate of\nRandal Gindi\nand\nZachary Gindi\nfor $8.5 million via a bankruptcy auction that was held in March. The property had been tied to the Gindi family since at least the 1970s, but the LLC that sold the building filed for bankruptcy protection in March, citing a $18.5 million unpaid mortgage on the Greenwich property and another on Nassau Street.\nIf you like this digest, you can get it even earlier \u2014 every evening \u2014 by subscribing to TRD Data,\nhere\n.",

Three are dominant players: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. Instead of promoting competition among them, the government does the opposite.\nWhen a homebuyer applies for a mortgage that will be sold to or backstopped by Fannie and Freddie \u2014 and we\u2019re talking\n70 percent of mortgages\n\u2014 the two government-sponsored entities require that the buyer\u2019s credit history be obtained from all three major credit bureaus.\nBecause of this \u201ctri-merge\u201d policy, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion do not have to compete for that business. The result is higher prices that inflate closing costs for buyers.\nThe Mortgage Bankers Association has\nlong called for reforms\n, lamenting in a June blog that \u201cgovernment mandates for a tri-merge report have insulated providers from competitive pressures, allowing them to raise prices with little regard for quality, performance, or innovation.\u201d\nThe Biden administration heeded that call in 2022, proposing two alternatives to tri-merge. One was \u201c\nbi-merge\n\u201d \u2014 requiring a credit score from two of the three major credit bureaus. The other was using the FICO 10T and VantageScore 4.0 models. Again, two sources.\nThe proposal was never implemented because Joe Biden lost the election a year before its scheduled start date, which the Federal Housing Finance Agency postponed four days before Biden left office. Industry opposition was a factor. As\nsix large mortgage players\nlater told the Trump administration\u2019s FHFA director,\nBill Pulte\n, the plan created \u201csignificant uncertainty, complexity, and multitude of unanswered questions.\u201d\nLast month, Pulte allowed Fannie and Freddie to use VantageScore 4.0 by itself, which will help responsible renters become homeowners because VantageScore takes rent and utility payments into account.\nPulte\nalso ditched the bi-merge plan, leaving tri-merge as the other choice.\nThe Mortgage Bankers Association cheered that news, but wants to replace tri-merge with a\nsingle-score option\n: Equifax, Experian\nor\nTransUnion. Using all three was once necessary because their reports varied widely, but their information is far more consistent now, the MBA says. Single-score is working well for auto loans and home equity loans, according to the group.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWoody Pascal, who authored the\ncriteria\nby which a substantially rehabilitated building may be removed from rent stabilization, was\nhired four months ago\nby the New York Apartment Association, which represents rent-stabilized owners.\nThe criteria \u2014 as interpreted by the Division of Homes and Community Renewal \u2014 have turned out to be very difficult to meet, trapping\nsome buildings\nin rent stabilization.\n\nBut the NYAA clearly did not blame Pascal. It considers the regulations to be a product of the agency, not of Pascal in particular.\nSend your thoughts on sub rehab and demolition to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The G train, which fully opened in 1937, was the last complete subway line built in New York City. It was originally called the IND Crosstown Line. No subway stations have been built in Brooklyn since 1948, when the A train was extended from Broadway Junction to Euclid Avenue. The\nInterborough Express\n, if built as planned, would end both of those droughts.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 A former NYPD lawyer filed a corruption suit against the department and Mayor Eric Adams, alleging she was fired after recommending disciplinary action against the highest-ranking uniformed officer, former Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey, according to\nGothamist\n. The plaintiff, Amy Litwin, investigated Maddrey following allegations by civilians that he intervened to halt the arrest of a retired officer who threatened teenagers.\n\u2014 Three years into Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s five-year housing plan, the state says it has \u201cbuilt or preserved\u201d 65,000 of the 100,000 promised affordable homes, according to\nCity &amp; State\n.\u00a0 However, according to the official housing plan dashboard, only 47,000 homes are done or in the works. The state attributes this discrepancy to a delay in data collection. New York City has the bulk of the units \u2014 19,000, including 8,000 in Brooklyn.\n\u2014 There\u2019s no official enforcement or oversight of ballot petitions, Gothamist\nreported\n. The outlet looked into fraudulent signatures found on Adams\u2019 petitions and concluded that no city official reviews the signatures. Enforcement is typically done by rival campaigns.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$5.5 million\nfor a 3,650-square-foot townhouse at 683 Leonard Street in Greenpoint. The Yuval Vidal Team at Compass had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$12 million\nfor a 35,349-square-foot warehouse at 31-39 39th Street in Sunnyside.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$15 million\nfor a 4,032-square-foot condominium unit at 36 Bleecker Street in Noho. Tony Sargent at Compass has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for an 870,124-square-foot, 22- and 28-story project with 630 total units at 61-06 Junction Boulevard in Rego Park. Lu Ning Architecture filed the permit on behalf of Jiashu Xu of Grand Construction and Development.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

Michael Shabani, who runs Los Angeles-based investment firm Crown Equity, was involved in the deal.

        "content": "In an otherwise dismal suburban office market, the O\u2019Hare area is gaining.\nThe submarket boasted the highest average asking rent in Chicago\u2019s suburbs last quarter, with rents up 5.5 percent year-over-year, according to Transwestern. The submarket\u2019s average rent climbed to $33.07 per-square-foot, outpacing the average suburban Chicago office rent of $27.12 per square foot.\nNo other suburban Chicago submarkets tracked by Transwestern saw rents increase by more than 1.5 percent year-over-year, and rents fell by more than 5 percent in two submarkets.\nEven with O\u2019Hare\u2019s slight advantage, the overall region is in worse shape than it was pre-pandemic.\nIn 2019, the suburban office market\u2019s direct vacancy rate hovered around 15 percent and now sits at 20 percent. The overall vacancy rate, which includes space being marketed, is at 26 percent.\n\nDemand had softened in the suburban markets before the pandemic, but the steep decline in office demand since then accelerated the trend.\nNow, class A offices, landlords with significant tenant-improvement dollars to offer or properties with close proximity to the airport appear to be attracting the few tenants that are looking for space.\nSignificant transactions in the second quarter included a 79,800-square-foot lease signed by the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund for the entire building at 800 Commerce Drive in Oak Brook. The lease did little to improve overall market conditions, however, as the firm is relocating from a 60,000 square-foot space at 2211 York Road, also in Oak Brook.\nJust down the road, Ashley Capital bought an 183,400-square-foot office building at 2001 York Road for $10 million, under $55 per square foot, from Varde Partners. Though the sale was rare for the slow market, it marked a significant decline in value for the property.\nThe building last sold in 2013 for $34 million, or $185 per square foot.",

The company will occupy about 31,000 square feet at the property.\nCome fall, Tubi\u2019s 140 Bay Area-based employees will move to the Kilroy building from its similarly sized headquarters across three floors at 315 Montgomery Street in the Financial District. Tubi has been based in those offices since 2017.\n\u201cWe had one primary requirement: a single floor,\u201d Natasha Valani, chief people officer at Tubi, told\nThe San Francisco Standard\nof the new lease. \u201cWhen you bring talented people together in one space, you increase the velocity of collaboration and connection.\u201d\n\nThe company simultaneously announced the launch of its Tubi Builders Program, an 18-month bootcamp \u201cdesigned to develop the next generation of product and engineering leaders.\u201d The program\u2019s inaugural run with a 20-person cohort will coincide with the opening of its new headquarters.\nThe 337,000-square-foot 201 3rd Street building welcomed other new tenants onto its floors earlier this year. In March, data analytics company\nAmplitude\nrecommitted to its nearly 60,000-square-foot lease until 2029. Last quarter, legal artificial intelligence startup Harvey signed a lease for 92,000 square feet at the building.\nThose companies fill a void left by Capital One, which departed the 120,000 square feet it occupied in the building at the end of last year. That loss dragged down the building\u2019s occupancy from 68.2 percent in the third quarter of last year to 25.5 percent by the end of the year, according to the Business Times. As of the second quarter this year, the 12-story building was 52.9 percent leased, per Kilroy.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The lending arm of the Rok family is accusing Miami-based developer Marlon Gomez of delaying the court sale of an Aventura site by allegedly filing frivolous bankruptcy petitions.\nAn affiliate of Aventura-based Rok Lending, led by CEO Bryan Morjain, is seeking to immediately reschedule an Aug. 4 foreclosure auction. It was canceled due to Gomez\u2019s entity that owns the 1.6-acre property at\n21291 Northeast 28th Avenue\nfiling for bankruptcy protection, court records show.\nIn February, Rok Lending\u2019s affiliate won a final judgment of $19.9 million against Gomez\u2019s entity, which allegedly defaulted on a\n$15 million\nloan issued in 2023.\nIn an emailed statement, Gomez said his entity and Rok Lending have worked out a resolution. \u201cWe have reached agreement with Rok on a deal that works for both of us,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cWe have our refinancing in process, look forward to paying off our loan and restarting an excellent project.\u201d\nRepresentatives and attorneys for Rok Lending did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nGomez\u2019s entity filed two Chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions in the past four months in order to stall the court sale of the property, where Gomez is planning a 142,000-square-foot medical office building, according to filings by Rok Lending\u2019s affiliate in Miami-Dade Circuit Court and Miami federal bankruptcy court.\nThe Aventura development site was first scheduled to be sold at an auction on April 22. But Gomez\u2019s entity filed for Chapter 11 protection the day before, which stayed the foreclosure proceedings, court records show. On May 20, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Mark dismissed the petition and restricted Gomez\u2019s entity from refiling for Chapter 11 protection for a period of 180 days, according to filings in bankruptcy court.\nHowever, Gomez\u2019s entity filed a second Chapter 11 petition \u201cjust minutes before the rescheduled [Aug. 4] foreclosure sale,\u201d a Rok Lending motion states. The petition lists assets between $10 million and $50 million and liabilities in the same amounts. Rok Lending alleges that the second bankruptcy petition is void due to the 180-day prohibition.\n\u201cTo be clear, the damage to [Rok Lending\u2019s] interests require emergent relief,\u201d the motion states. \u201cThis property is underwater and every day that [Rok Lending\u2019s] realization on its collateral is delayed results in immediate and irreparable damage.\u201d\nThe Aventura site is not the only property tied to Gomez that is facing foreclosure. A court-appointed receiver is listing a distressed 1.8-acre Miami River development site for\n$18.1 million\nthat is owned by a Gomez-managed entity. Karson &amp; Co and The Porosoff Group, the brokerages marketing the Miami River property, have set an Aug. 20 deadline to receive offers.The site is subject to a pending foreclosure lawsuit filed in March by a lender alleging Gomez\u2019s entity defaulted on a\n$10 million loan\n.",

        "content": "Gary Mkrtichyan said his construction company Opus Builders receives two to three calls per day from prospective wildfire rebuilding clients.\nHe\u2019s got about a dozen\nAltadena homeowners\nhe\u2019s working with but thinks that could easily grow to 20 within the next couple of months. That\u2019s in addition to a mixed-use project with apartments above ground-floor commercial near Palisades Village in Pacific Palisades.\nAs more homeowners make the decision to stay and\nrebuild\n, nailing down a consensus on cost is a bit like herding cats. In other words, a painful exercise with seemingly no point.\nThe construction inflation is real, according to Mkrtichyan who said some of the quotes he hears are coming in wildly beyond reality for his company.\nAn example? The conversation around pricing that\u2019s $700 and above per square foot to rebuild. Mkrtichyan can\u2019t see it.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not one client that I\u2019m charging $700 a square foot,\u201d he said. \u201cI built three homes in the Palisades prior to the fires below that number. Now, OK, I understand there\u2019s been some appreciation. There\u2019s a labor shortage, especially with ICE [raids], but I know this is not the reason for these numbers people are talking about.\u201d\nThe exception would be maybe adding a basement level, he said.\nMkrtichyan said there\u2019s no client for which Opus Builders is currently charging more than $550 to $600 per square foot at the moment. The company bills itself as a one-stop-shop general contractor specializing in upscale custom homes and commercial projects, which could explain what some might call a low quote.\nOpus has the capacity to handle architecture, design and construction internally, while working with a roster of subcontractors and acting as a project manager on planning, permitting and sourcing of finishes. All of that being overseen by a single touchpoint can in some ways help keep costs in line.\nThe builder walks into what\u2019s become a heated discussion among some. It\u2019s one some might say began in February when The Agency\u2019s Ben Belack posted an\nInstagram video\non rebuilding.\nBelack broke down the challenges developers face in buying burned Palisades lots based on a construction cost of $600 per square foot. When factoring in the cost of the Measure United to House L.A. tax, in addition to commission, escrow, title and other fees, the end result is a loss.\nMeasure ULA, which was a 2022 ballot measure marketed as the Mansion Tax, applies a 4 percent levy on deals starting at $5.3 million. It creeps up to 5.5 percent on deals of $10.6 million or more. It\u2019s relevant in the Palisades rebuilding conversation because the community is part of the city of Los Angeles. Eaton Fire properties, if resold, are not subject to the tax because Altadena and Pasadena are not part of the city of Los Angeles.\n\u201cThe lesson here is that prohibitive measures like the Mansion Tax continue to discourage builders from building in Los Angeles and, before you vilify the homebuilders, we really need them right now to replace all the homes and communities the fire just took from us,\u201d Belack says in his video. \u201cThe land is for sale because these specific families are unable to rebuild, so unless we allow builders to make a few bucks, which is usually around 20 percent of their investment, Los Angeles remains in a housing crisis.\u201d\n\nMounting headaches\nBelack\u2019s post, as of Thursday, had garnered nearly 29,000 likes and almost 3,000 comments from people launching discussions on land values, zoning, affordable housing in the state, taxes and the subject of costs to rebuild. Central to Belack\u2019s post wasn\u2019t to set off a squeal over who was charging what, but to point out\nMeasure ULA\n\u2019s impediment to rebuilding.\nEven still, it cracked open a discussion around cost that has been eating away at residents since the Jan. 7 fires.\nResults of a\nsurvey\ndone between March 6 and April 11 show\nPalisades\nresidents estimating $800 per square foot for construction, which was culled from 307 respondents. That\u2019s an average based on a range swinging from $400 to over $1,200 a foot.\nThe Urban Land Institute sponsored the survey that was administered by Real Estate Consulting, with endorsements from the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and USC Lusk Center for Real Estate.\nThe Eaton fire data in that same survey draws from a smaller pool of 37 respondents that estimated an average of $580 per square foot in construction costs. The mean was based on a range of $400 to $800 per square foot.\nFor most wildfire victims, budgets are not unlimited. In fact, those on the ground almost universally call out the funding shortfall for rebuilds as a major pain point.\nOpus\u2019 Mkrtichyan is no different, pointing out most in Altadena that he\u2019s working with don\u2019t have sufficient funds to cover rebuilding. Some, he said, applied for relief through the U.S. Small Business Administration in a bid to offset some of the difference. THE SBA offers disaster loans up to $500,000 for the repair or replacement of a primary residence and up to $100,000 for personal property loss. Other clients of Opus Builders paid out of pocket to make up the difference, but those are typically residents that were already doing a remodel and had funds available.\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s probably 60-40 between people who have just enough to rebuild and then 40 [percent] are probably ones that don\u2019t have enough or had a lapse in coverage and those people are the ones that are either going towards the SBA or they\u2019re stuck, and they have to sell or figure out some sort of funding,\u201d Mkrtichyan said.\nOnce homeowners push past questions of funding, it\u2019s now navigating\npermitting\n.\nSo far, Opus Builders has six Altadena projects submitted to the county. They\u2019re part of the 1,454 applications received as of Thursday for the unincorporated areas impacted by the Eaton fire, according to Los Angeles County. That\u2019s a jump of over 100 applications since Monday. So far, 172 building permits have been issued.\n\u201cI think they\u2019re overwhelmed,\u201d Mkrtichyan said of the system. \u201cIt\u2019s too much workload and there is a void between submitting and getting a response.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Nathan Berman\u2019s Metro Loft sealed the deal on its recapitalization of one of its most prominent conversions.\nMetro Loft secured a five-year, $280 million mortgage to refinance its debt at 180 Water Street in the Financial District, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The Deutsche Bank loan carries a 6.4 percent fixed interest rate, according to Moody\u2019s.\nTo avoid a looming $365 million debt maturity, Metro Loft also brought in additional investors. Sentuy Realty and 60 Guilders bought the property\u2019s mezzanine loan for $80 million and invested an additional $40 million in the building.\nMetro Loft is still an owner of the property, though Berman didn\u2019t disclose what his stake in the building was at this point. In May, it was reported that 60 Guilders and Sentry would\nacquire a combined 50 percent interest\nin the property.\nIn April, the special servicer of a $265 million securitized loan filed a pre-foreclosure action against Metro Loft, which came after a November KBRA report revealing Metro Loft was nearing default on its mortgage.\n\nAfter the pre-foreclosure action was filed, a representative of the developer said it would be \u201cbringing in a new partner to pay off the debt.\u201d The pre-foreclosure case was expected to be dropped when the recap was finalized, though it\u2019s unclear if that\u2019s happened yet; Metro Loft did not immediately respond to a request for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nBerman\npaid $450 million\nin 2017 to buy Vanbarton Group out of the rental property. That was three years after Metro Loft purchased a minority stake in the property and two years after the partners launched a $100 million conversion.\nThe 573-unit, 460,000-square-foot conversion opened in 2017. Occupancy is at 98 percent. Amenities include a 1,200-square-foot courtyard and an indoor pool.\nApartments are leasing for an average of $5,000, according to Moody\u2019s, and the building generated $17 million in net operating income last year. The property was valued at $378 million in an appraisal two months ago.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Starlife Group launched an EB-5 investor program that will help fund construction of a planned luxury Hollywood rental development.\nAventura-based Starlife, led by CEO Gevorg Shahbazyan, is seeking EB-5 investors for 21 Hollywood, a 14-story, 200-unit building that will include about 10,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space at 2100 North Federal Highway. A Starlife affiliate paid $6.5 million for the 1.5-acre development site in 2023.\nShahbazyan said his fund is seeking 25 investors who can invest a minimum of $800,000 each, for a total of $20 million. The federal visa program provides permanent U.S. residency to foreigners and their immediate family members who invest in businesses, including real estate developments, that create at least 10 full-time American jobs.\n\u201cAssume that the construction loan today is averaging about 8 to 10.5 percent interest,\u201d Shahbazyan said. \u201cEB-5 offers much lower interest rates, of 5 to 7 percent, or sometimes lower. It\u2019s a great tool for the investors to become U.S. residents. The only downside is it\u2019s a bit slow.\u201d\nHe expects investors from Asia and Latin America, where EB-5 is most popular. (The Trump administration is working on a\ngold card program\nthat will provide citizenship to foreigners who pay about $5 million.)\nStarlife\u2019s construction affiliate is building the Hollywood project, and work began earlier this year, records show. It\u2019s expected to be completed by early 2027. Kobi Karp designed the project.\n\nThe developer secured site plan approval in late 2023. Units will range from 489-square-foot studios to 1,250-square-foot, three-bedroom apartments. Shahbazyan said apartments made the most sense for the site after completing a market analysis.\n\u201cWe believe the rental market is the strongest, highest and best use for this area, especially luxury because there\u2019s not a lot,\u201d he said.\nStarlife has multifamily, mixed-use, hotel and single-family and townhouse developments, mostly in Broward County. Hollywood 21 marks its first in\nHollywood\nand its first EB-5-funded project, Shahbazyan said.\nEarlier this year, developer Louis Birdman and his partners\nadvanced plans\nto build 618 apartments in Hollywood, as part of a mixed-use development on a city-owned brownfield property just west of I-95.\nCalta Group, led by brothers Gaetano and Ignazio Caltagirone, are building a pair of apartment projects in Hollywood totaling 251 rentals. In February, they secured a\n$53.7 million construction loan\nfor Caltopia Hollywood at 2750 Van Buren Street and Caltopia Hollywood II at 2217-2239 Jackson Street.\n",

Plans call for construction to start in September and be completed in the summer of 2026.\nFoundry Commercial keeps its Texas office in the Oak Lawn district of Dallas, about a mile from Old Parkland, where Harlan Crow\u2019s operation keeps its headquarters, surrounded by various family offices and other investment firms on the campus. The developer has been busy in the DFW market and elsewhere in recent years, plying a specialty of office-to-industrial conversions. It now has five properties in DFW, including a project that is underway on several buildings in Plano. It has another five conversions under its belt in various markets around the U.S.\n\nThe latest deal indicates that Foundry Commercial sees continued potential as office markets are ailing in many suburban markets. The strategy is based on what the developer expects to be \u201cstrong demand from logistics and manufacturing users who want to be closer to labor, rooftops, and major transportation corridors,\u201d partner and general manager Jim Traynor told the outlet.\nSupporting the strategy in Irving is limits on industrial zoning amid strong demand for Class A industrial space, which the developer can address with new construction.\nThe developer has retained Holt Lunsford Commercial\u2019s Andrew Gilbert and Keaton Bryce \u2014 the duo behind the recent $43.5 million sale of the Dallas Morning News\u2019 620,000-square-foot printing facility in Plano \u2014 to handle leasing on the latest project in Irving.\n",

        "content": "Local firm Sightwell is pitching an $18 million development on the site of a former lumber yard in the downtown of suburban village East Dundee.\nThe proposed Heritage Station development would center around a performing arts center and feature a mix of retail, apartments and townhomes, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. The village purchased the property at 110 Railroad Street, previously the site of Doederlein Lumber, in 2023. The primary stipulation placed on the property by the village board of trustees was that any development include a performing arts center.\nSightwell was the sole developer to submit plans to the village\u2019s request for proposal. The firm pitched an 8,000-square-foot performing arts center consisting of a 4,000-square-foot stage and 2,000-square-foot lobby, flexible seating and classrooms. A second floor would include six apartments and 10 suites of lodging.\nAnother residential component would face Hill Street, adding nine to 12 townhomes with alley garages and front stoops.\nThe performing arts center was proposed as a lease-to-own structure in order to attract nonprofit or other civic organizations to take the helm. Andy Burns, co-founder of Sightwell, said the concept is designed to promote walkability, and decisions on businesses to go in the retail component will complement existing downtown commerce.\n\nOf the three design options proposed, one featuring a clock tower appealed most to the trustees.\nStillwell asked the village to sell the company the site for $10 and contribute $2.5 million in Tax Increment Financing. Another $10 million would come from private investors and $5.5 million from the organization that ends up leasing the performing arts center.\nQuestions remain about the development going forward. Located a little more than a block from the Fox River and located in a flood plain, trustees raised concerns about how that might potentially affect neighboring properties. Sightwell promised to assess those concerns in the engineering process.\nA decision to move forward will come in the coming months after a development agreement is drafted with the village for board approval, potentially lending to construction starting at the end of next year, with a target completion in summer 2028.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The unnamed group bought the debt on the building, which was\nin foreclosure\n, for $42.5 million. The building last sold in 2013 for $95.8 million.\nIt\u2019s MacMahon\u2019s latest buy in a year-long streak of purchases in the Union Square area.\nLast August, an investor group tied to MacMahon bought the four-story building at 225 Post Street from the parent company of former tenant Burberry to the tune of $17.4 million, according to the\nSan Francisco Business Times\n. The following month, a MacMahon affiliate bought 11 retail properties across five buildings in Hayes Valley for $10.9 million.\n\u201cMy partners and I are long-term investors, and we believe San Francisco in the long-term is a great market for investing in real estate,\u201d MacMahon told\nThe Real Deal\nat the time of the Hayes Valley buys. \u201cWe have made a number of investments in retail in the past so we are very comfortable with the asset class.\u201d\n\nMacMahon made both of those purchases through a different partnership group and not his Moran Capital company, where he\u2019s a principal.\nUnion Square is shaping up to be an attractive area for out-of-town investors looking to grab commercial properties at bargain-basement prices.\nIan Jacobs\n, an heir of the Reichmann real estate dynasty, has been on a buying spree in the neighborhood in recent months.\nIt started in April when Jacobs purchased an Art Deco building at 200-216 Powell Street for $7.4 million, according to the\nBusiness Times\n.

All of that is is taking shape just a few miles from the quantum computing campus the State of Illinois plans to sponsor at the former South Works steel mill along the Lake Michigan\nPlans call for the additions of housing and retail to what is now open green space on the Chicago State campus.\nA request for proposals calls for would-be developers to offer plans for financing, design and timelines.The school expects four phases of development, with the eventual possibility of additional apartments, ranging from studios to \u201cfamily-sized units\u201d to achieve a \u201ccollege town experience.\u201d\n\nChicago State has an annual enrollment of about 2,000 and is the lone four-year institution serving a predominantly Black student body in Illinois. It is largely a commuter school, serving locals who do not live on campus, and generates about $1.6 billion in economic activity, according to a recent state study, which found that about 20 percent of the money is spent outside its immediate area.\nThe redevelopment plan aims to capture more of the economic activity within the South Side neighborhood.\n\u201cUniversity Village 95 is more than a real estate project. It\u2019s a commitment to equitable development through real estate investment,\u201d said Andrea Zopp, chair of the CSU board of trustees, who previously served as deputy mayor and chief neighborhood development officer under Rahm Emanuel\u2019s mayorship.\nThe materials the school distributed by the plan did not spell out much in the way of specifics on what would be considered \u201cequitable development\u201d or how the plan would conform to the broadly stated goal.\n",

        "content": "Developer Michael Shvo has engaged in a high-stakes arbitration dispute with Bayerische Versorgungskammer, the German pension fund that has backed many of his high-profile U.S. projects.\nShvo has filed a claim through the private Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, alleging he is owed more than $85 million in fees, including $27 million in payments tied to specific properties and $21 million in carried interest from the Transamerica Pyramid project in San Francisco,\nBisnow reported\n.\nBVK said in a statement it is \u201cnot unusual to seek a separation, possibly prematurely, depending on the performance of an investment, the overall market or the existing interest of third parties.\u201d\nShvo declined to comment, according to Bisnow.\nThe legal clash comes amid mounting concerns in Germany over BVK\u2019s exposure to Shvo\u2019s ventures, which have faced delays and financial troubles. Shvo\u2019s projects \u2014 often funded by German pensioner money \u2014 include the Raleigh Hotel in Miami, Mandarin Oriental Residences in Beverly Hills and 711 Fifth Avenue in New York. BVK has invested more than $712 million in Shvo-related deals via a fund managed by Deutsche Finance America, though the pension fund emphasizes it has no direct contractual relationship with Shvo.\nThe arbitration dispute was sparked in part by leadership upheaval. Rainer Komenda, BVK\u2019s longtime real estate head, and Jason Lucas, who oversaw BVK\u2019s U.S. investments at Deutsche Finance, have both exited their roles. The Bavarian State Parliament has questioned BVK after German tabloid Abendzeitung reported on potential pension fund losses tied to Shvo\u2019s struggling developments. BVK has since launched an internal review.\n\nBVK maintains that its investments are managed prudently and that any potential losses will not impact pension benefits. In 2024, BVK achieved a 3.4 percent net return, which it says exceeds its actuarial requirements.\nSome of Shvo\u2019s projects have stalled or defaulted.\nIn Miami, redevelopment of the historic Raleigh Hotel has dragged on for years, and the property is now subject to a $275 million bid from\nNahla Capital\n, which Shvo can match to retain control. In Beverly Hills, he\ndefaulted\non $200 million in loans just four months after completing the Mandarin Oriental Residences, selling most of the units in bulk to Centurion Real Estate Partners.\nShvo recently achieved a legal victory in a\nhigh-profile dispute\nwith members-only Core Club, a tenant in the Transamerica Pyramid. Earlier this week, a New York judge ordered Core Club to pay him nearly $1 million. The club took out a $750,000 loan from Shvo in 2022, but defaulted by failing to pay up when its location on Manhattan\u2019s Fifth Avenue opened the next year.\nCore is appealing the decision and continues to accuse Shvo of misconduct.\n\u2014Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "Two New Yorkers are facing prison after allegedly swiping a Kew Gardens Hills home from a dying widow \u2014 the first prosecution under the state\u2019s new deed-theft law.\nOn Thursday, New York Attorney General Letitia announced the indictment of Deepa Roy, 68, of Manhattan, and Victor Quimis, 39, of Queens, for falsifying property records to take the longtime home of Renuka Bherwani, who was in hospice care. Quimis was arrested earlier this week; Roy remains at large, according to\nCrain\u2019s\n.\nProsecutors say the pair forged Bherwani\u2019s signature in October to transfer the home to themselves for nothing, then repeated the trick in December to move it into a Quimis-controlled shell company. That helped the pair allegedly set up a $552,500 mortgage, which they allegedly used to clear the property\u2019s debts and pocket roughly $312,000.\nRoy allegedly earned at least $15,000 for her part in the scheme.\nBherwani\u2019s family discovered the theft only when city mail congratulating Quimis on his \u201cnew\u201d ownership arrived at the house. The widow, who bought the home with her husband in 1986, had been battling dementia since 2020 and granted power of attorney to her son and daughter-in-law. Prosecutors allege Roy insinuated herself into the home after her husband\u2019s death in 2022, posing as a friend and even asking to move in \u2014 a request the family denied.\n\nJames said deed theft has become rampant in gentrifying neighborhoods where homeowners are \u201ccash-poor and equity-rich,\u201d with scammers targeting seniors and those in financial distress. The attorney general\u2019s office is also probing a Harlem case where a brownstone worth millions was allegedly stolen, leaving its owner homeless.\nThe 2023 law \u2014 drafted by James and Brooklyn state Sen. Zellnor Myrie \u2014 extended the statute of limitations on cases and gave the AG authority to prosecute directly, rather than relying on local district attorneys. A companion measure passed also gave the attorney general and local prosecutors the power to\nhalt court proceedings\nwhere the possession of a property is in dispute.\nBoth Roy and Quimis face charges including grand larceny and residential mortgage fraud, carrying potential sentences of eight to 25 years.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A manufactured homes firm and PGIM Real Estate bought a mobile home community with 377 homesites near Greenacres for $28.1 million.\nOrem, Utah-based Havenpark Communities and Newark, New Jersey-based PGIM bought the Tavares Cove Mobile Home Park at 2315 Espana Real in unincorporated Palm Beach County, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The property consists of the Tavares Cove I complex and the Tavares Cove II complex.\nLawrence M. Abramson and Sarajane Abramson Marell, as trustees of the Ruth C. Abramson Trust sold Tavares Cove I, according to records. Lawrence M. Abramson and Sarajane Abramson Marell in their individual capacity sold Tavares Cove II.\nThe land spans\u00a0 54.1 acresthat includes a 2,400-square-foot clubhouse completed in 1970 and a 688-square-foot clubhouse completed in 1974, Vizzda records show.\nAcross South Florida, developers have scooped up\nmobile home communities\n, with plans to redevelop them. Generally, residents own their mobile home and rent the lot it sits on.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that Havenpark will redevelop Tavares Cove because the firm is a manager of manufactured home communities. The firm, led by CEO Robbie Pratt, installed more than 4,000 affordable manufactured homes since 2019, according to its website.\nPGIM is the asset management arm of financial services firm Prudential Financial\nElsewhere in South Florida, Seville General Partners wants to redevelop the Seville Mobile Home Park at 426 Northeast Fifth Street and 515 North Federal Highway in Hallandale Beach with a\n750-unit multifamily project\nwith\u00a0 25,200 square feet of retail and 44,200 square feet of offices.\nIn December, Cade Capital paid\n$26.5 million\nfor the Sunnyside Motel &amp; Trailer Park at 6020 Southwest Eighth Street in West Miami, as well as an adjacent auto shop. At the time, Cade had no immediate redevelopment plans.\nIn El Portal, Adam Neumann\u2019s Flow and Israeli firm Canada Global plan\n2,380-plus apartments\nwith commercial space and a school on the former\ntrailer park\nsite at 8500 Biscayne Boulevard.\n",

        "content": "Mack Real Estate Development, the development subsidiary of Mack Real Estate Group, has received the go-ahead from the Los Angeles City Council for a 51-story residential high-rise in Downtown Los Angeles.\nThe proposed tower at 1105-1123 South Olive Street will rise 603 feet and feature 536 studio to three-bedroom apartments above 4,178 square feet of ground-floor commercial space,\nUrbanize Los Angeles reported\n. A four-level podium and six subterranean parking levels will hold 581 cars. The design by Arcadis includes rooftop and podium-level amenity decks.\nThe project replaces a surface parking lot. Construction will take more than 30 months, although a start date is not set.\nAlong with project entitlements, the council approved a nearly $11.5 million public benefits package in exchange for a floor area rights transfer from the Los Angeles Convention Center. While officials initially proposed directing some of those funds to the convention center itself, revised conditions now allocate the funds toward affordable housing.\nThe high-rise is one part of Mack\u2019s broader redevelopment vision for the Downtown L.A. market. A second proposed tower \u2014 a 60-story building with more than 700 units \u2014 is planned just east across Olive Street.\n\nThose developments are the final phases of a large-scale plan Mack Real Estate launched a decade ago with AECOM. Completed elements include the 362-unit Wren apartments on Pico Boulevard, the 38-story Aven tower on Grand Avenue and a pocket park. Additionally, a 16-story hotel has already been approved for a nearby site at 12th Street and Olive.\nTogether, the projects mark a transformation of the South Park neighborhood in Downtown L.A., as high-density mixed-use towers replace surface parking lots and industrial buildings.\nNew York-based Mack was founded in 2013 after William Mack liquidated his family\u2019s holdings in Apollo Real Estate Advisers, according to the company website. It has three divisions focused on development and ownership, lending and property management. The company is run by CEO Richard Mack.\n\u2014Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "Harris County commissioners rejected a proposal Thursday from Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo for a \u201cpenny\u201d property tax increase by neglecting to take a vote before a noon deadline to send the tax question to voters in November.\nSeeking to fill a coming budget gap from expiring American Rescue Plan Act federal dollars the county used to fund child care programs, Hidalgo claimed the hike of $10 per $100,000 of valuation would add $24 per year to the average homeowner\u2019s property tax bill, the Texas Scorecard\nreported\n.\nThe proposal was expected to generate about $60 million a year in property tax revenue for the county, proponents said. Projected revenues were not published in the Harris County Commissioners Court\u2019s meeting agenda. Even though Hidalgo pitched her plan as a \u201cpenny\u201d increase, no specific numbers were put forth.\nDemocrat commissioners Lesley Briones, Rodney Ellis and Adrian Garcia withheld support for Hidalgo\u2019s proposal along with Republican Commissioner Tom Ramsey. As no one seconded Hidalgo\u2019s proposal for a vote, it died.\n\nEllis proposed his own plan, which would\u2019ve increased the county tax rate by 2.8 cents per $100 valuation, and Judge Hidalgo seconded the measure, but it failed in a 3-2 vote.\nThe failed motions came after a contentious morning where Hidalgo held signs with her staff and encouraged children in the audience, who were purportedly recipients of child care paid for from the ARPA funds, to take part in demonstrations for the property tax hike. The judge and fellow commissioners also accused one another of lying to the public.\nResident resentment to additional taxes is growing, the outlet said. After last year\u2019s disastrous spring and summer storms, the May derecho and Hurricane Beryl in July, Commissioners passed a disaster-rate tax hike \u2014 allowed by the state of Texas to bypass the typical 3.5 percent threshold that would require voter-approval. That raised the county\u2019s overall tax rate from $0.35007 to $0.38529 per $100 valuation.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The sellers, financier Harsh Padia and his wife, interior designer Purvi Padia, sold the apartment for roughly double what they paid for it nine years earlier.\nPlans for the 9,500-square-foot penthouse at 140 Jane Street include floor-to-ceiling windows, a wraparound terrace and three balconies. The building, which quietly launched sales last summer, is slated for completion in early 2027. All but one of its units have already entered contract.\nThe inked contract \u201creinforces what everyone\u2019s saying about Downtown Manhattan,\u201d said Nikki Field of Sotheby\u2019s International, who\u2019s representing the buyer in the deal. \u201cIt\u2019s the new billionaires\u2019 coast.\u201d\n\nField declined to share the identity of the buyer but said her client agreed to purchase the property from a Zoom presentation. She added that the city\u2019s new development market hasn\u2019t seen a building so close to sellout this far in advance of completion since Extell Development\u2019s One57, signaling high demand for quality projects in the face of rapidly declining new development inventory.\nA Corcoran Sunshine team, led by Tara King-Brown, is heading sales at the project. Both King-Brown and Field declined to share the sale price.\nNews of the contract first surfaced in an Instagram post on Compass\u2019 Leonard Steinberg\u2019s account pushing back against industry outcry against private exclusive listings, including criticisms that marketing homes through this channel prevents sellers from nabbing top-tier prices.\n\u201cThe Downtown luxury markets are significantly healthier than the numbers being reported.\u00a0 Especially in brand new buildings,\u201d Steinberg wrote in the comment. \u201cThose spewing a narrative that private exclusives depress all pricing are obviously very wrong.\u201d\nJake Indursky contributed reporting.\n",

Cejas\u2019 420 Lincoln Rd Development LLC is requesting to rezone the 1.6-acre site at that address, to replace the 15,340-square-foot commercial building at 1600 Washington Avenue with a planned 15-story, 210-unit multifamily development, the outlet reported.\nThe apartments will span nearly 217,000 square feet, including 7,000 square feet of retail, a pool deck, 36 studio units, 144 one-bedroom units and 30 two-bedroom units. Units will range in size from 560 square feet to 1,100 square feet. The design team includes Mexico-based architect Enrique Norten of Ten Arquitectos and Miami-based Beilinson Gomez Architects.\nLocal attorney Neisen Kadsin is representing the project, and told the outlet the new zoning would increase the floor-area ratio and up the allowable height to 150 feet.\n\n\u201cEveryone in the city has identified this as a need, not luxury condos but market-rate residential,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cIt\u2019s a realistic project that could be developed in a relatively short period of time for a much-needed market-rate rental product that will be affordable for many of the people who work there.\u201d\nThe rezoning requires two votes of approval from the City Commission and for the Historic Preservation Board to review the site plan.\nRecords show Cejas bought the majority of the\nLincoln Road\nblock for $14.5 million in 1997. Cejas, a longtime Democratic fundraiser, was ambassador to Belgium from 1998 to 2001, according to published reports. In 2020, he sold his waterfront Star Island mansion for\n$20.1 million\n.

        "content": "A historic Oak Park home reoriented onsite and redesigned by Frank Lloyd Wright is back on the market for the first time in 24 years.\nThe Hills-DeCaro House was built in 1883 as a Victorian and purchased in 1900 by Wright\u2019s client, Nathan Moore, as a gift for his daughter. Wright updated the six-bedroom, 6,350-square-foot home in his Prairie style, turning the home 90 degrees in the process, as reported in\nCrain\u2019s\n. The asking price for the 313 Forest Avenue home is just shy of $2.3 million. Wright also added two verandas on the first floor and updated the home\u2019s siding to stucco with dark wood trim.\nThe home has a long history of renovations and other unique details: a fire in 1976 caused during a restoration project burned most of the first floor, according to the Frank Lloyd Wright Trust. Also on the one-third acre property stands a ticket booth from the 1893 World\u2019s Columbian Exposition, held 20 miles away in Jackson Park. It was first used by the Hills family as a children\u2019s playhouse.\n\nThe previous owners restored the home from the fire and updated its utilities, and the windows are recreations of the original glass style. The kitchen was also expanded to modern preferences from what had been a small galley kitchen, opening up smaller rooms to pair it with a breakfast room. The basement was also updated for entertainment. The current owners also added a walled, private patio in the backyard.\nBoth the living room fireplace and the primary bedroom fireplace feature narrow, horizontal Roman bricks, and built-in bookcases are featured throughout. The sunroom on the first floor was previously an open-air porch, but now has windows with views of other Wright homes in the area, such as the original home Moore commissioned Wright to design in 1895 in the Tudor style.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The debt, from University Place Asset Management and Axonic Capital, amounts to nearly $3 million per unit.\nThe developer, One Turtle Creek LLC, is a joint venture between Swiss wealth advisory firm SVAG and USA Infrastructure Investments.\nThe deal refinanced the previous construction loan and provided the needed capital required to complete the 18-story project.\nThe units are expected to be priced from $3 million to $20 million, spanning 2,000 to 6,380 square feet. Its amenities will include views of the Dallas skyline, a private garden, infinity pool, dog park, pet spa and library.\n\nThe building will be managed by Rosewood Hotels &amp; Resorts. It\u2019s within walking distance from the five-star hotel Rosewood Mansion on Turtle Creek, where Rosewood Hotels &amp; Resorts was founded. The hospitality company is now headquartered in Hong Kong.\nThe units are expected to attract locals as well as buyers from all over the world, said Eric Sitman, managing director of Axonic Capital. Chicago-based Lucien Lagrange Studio is the architectural firm working on the project, and Compass is handling sales.\nThe project is anticipated to be completed in about a year.\nThe Dallas luxury condo market is less developed than in cities like New York and Miami, but it\u2019s\ngradually maturing\n. Other developments underway include the Knox Hotel and Residences, which will be managed by Auberge Resorts Collection. The developer is a venture of Michael Dell\u2019s MSD Partners and Dallas-based Trammell Crow Company. It\u2019s expected to have 48 condos and 150 hotel rooms. Raising Cane\u2019s founder Todd Graves last year\nbought a penthouse\nin the building, which had been listed at $25 million.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Thousands of housing units, missed deadlines and another boost for federal housing tax credits.\nThese describe some of the major housing-related headlines of the week. Thrilling, right?\nThe first refers to the\nMidtown South rezoning\n, which could pave the way for roughly 9,500 new housing units over the next decade. This week, City Council carved out some midblock properties in the Garment District and reduced residential density allowed in the southeast portion of the rezoning in a nod to the manufacturers still operating in the neighborhood. The changes reduced housing projections by 140-ish units.\nThe fact that the Garment District carveout only affects portions of the midblocks is key.\nTo exempt all midblock areas on West 36th and 40th streets between Seventh and Eighth avenues would have eliminated a lot more housing opportunities. By my count, at least 458 units of projected housing across six properties would have been shaved off the production numbers estimated by City Planning if residential was removed from all the midblocks in that area (the City Council subcommittee meeting on Wednesday made it sound like that was the change).\nThe language for the modifications was released Thursday night, which cleared things up a bit, but not before I printed out maps of Midtown South and highlighted the properties on the midblocks where housing would be lost, like a crazy person.\nAnyway, some have questioned the wisdom of the carveout, even if it is more surgical than what had previously been proposed.\n\u201cThis area has long since ceased to include any meaningful manufacturing activity, let alone garment factories or assembly,\u201d Herrick\u2019s Mitch Korbey tells me. \u201cThe Planning Commission saw this and appropriately called for a rezoning \u2014 we should trust and abide by the thoughtful and careful planning work done by the experts.\u00a0 Maintaining manufacturing zoning where no manufacturing jobs or activity exists is not sound planning \u2014 it simply will keep vacant or under-utilized buildings that could have a new and vibrant life as apartments and affordable housing.\u201d\nCouncil members said the changes were made to preserve the area\u2019s unique ecosystem of businesses and ensure \u201cnew housing and new business growth can thrive side-by-side.\u201d\nAlso this week, the state held a meeting about the megadevelopment Pacific Park that \u2014\u00a0by the state\u2019s own deadlines \u2014\u00a0should have involved discussions about a newly approved development team for the project. Alas, the meeting was largely about why the meeting was\nnot\nabout the newly approved developers.\nEmpire State Development previously said that a new development team would be approved and the development rights for six of the Pacific Park sites transferred by August 1. That didn\u2019t happen, according to state officials, because the proposed development team \u2014\u00a0Cirrus and LCOR \u2014\u00a0also submitted an application to take over another property known as Site 5. The officials said they need more time to review both takeover bids. They hope to finish this up sometime in September. Maybe. For a full rundown, check out my\nstory\n.\nAt the federal level, housing groups this week celebrated the Federal Housing Finance Agency\u2019s decision to raise the amount that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can invest in low-income housing tax credits. Each can now invest $2 billion, up from the $1 billion cap set last year.\n\nThe change comes after the \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d reconciliation bill expanded the tax credits. Per the National Housing Conference\u2019s David Dworkin, the increase is an important complement to the credit expansion, because it will help \u201censure that the market will absorb the additional credits without diminishing their value.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: What questions do you have for the mayoral candidates that haven\u2019t been addressed in their various public events and interviews? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The number of listings submitted to local listing services between June 11 (when the FARE Act went into effect) and July 31 has dropped 74 percent year-over-year,\nTRD\n\u2019s\nSheridan Wall reports\n.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 The DOJ has subpoenaed New York Attorney General Letitia James, the\nNew York Times\nreports. The investigation concerns two separate cases from James\u2019 office: the suit in which President Trump and his organization were found liable for fraud, and a case regarding the National Rifle Association\u2019s tax fraud. This follows the FBI\u2019s probe into the AG\u2019s real estate dealings.\n\u2014 Andrew Cuomo presented his affordability plan during a press conference on Thursday, comparing his agenda with Zohran Mamdani\u2019s, which he called irresponsible and unrealistic,\namNY\nreports. Cuomo outlined his plans for transportation, groceries, wages and taxes. This is the second briefing of its kind, following Monday\u2019s discussion of crime and public safety.\n\u2014 Mayor Eric Adams opened a new campaign office in Mill Basin. One problem: the building has a full vacate order still in place, according to\nthe City\n. In 2023, the parapet of the building collapsed, leading the Department of Buildings to issue the vacancy order that\u2019s still in effect. Though the wall has been repaired, the building will need to be reinspected before the campaign office can open. \u2014\nQuinn Waller\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$22 million\nfor a condominium unit at 520 Park Avenue. The Lenox Hill condo is a new-construction unit and 4,700 square feet.\nPeter Ashe\u2019s\nAsher Alcobi and Meirav Gavrielov have the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$13.3 million\nfor a development site at\u00a0 20-35 130th Street. Manhattan developer\nTurnbridge Equities\npurchased the 103,000-square-foot Queens lot.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $2.9 million for a condo unit at 2505 Broadway. The Upper West Side condo is 1,300 square feet.\nThe Agency\nhas the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for a proposed 95,238-square-foot, six-story, mixed-use building at 444 Carroll Street in Brooklyn. Architect Kao Hwa Lee is the applicant of record.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

That cuts a stark contrast to the April debacle when a representative from\nHagerty Consulting\nspoke to residents, but was unable to answer questions around what the Chicago outfit had done in relation to infrastructure, public health and community outreach.\nHagerty\u2019s Chicago headquarters has been a point of contention for some, who think a local will do what\u2019s best for locals. Maybe the AECOM reps at Thursday\u2019s meeting heard that and meant to take a shot when Matt Talley, senior vice president and client account manager at AECOM, told residents, \u201cOur U.S. business is based here in Los Angeles, and I\u2019ll just repeat that. We\u2019re based in Los Angeles and so we\u2019re part of the community.\u201d\nPowerPoint to PowerPoint, AECOM outlined more than 15 meetings with city divisions such as the Department of Water and Power and the Los Angeles Police Department; over 10 community meetings; and outlined its plans for infrastructure restoration, future fire protection and logistics and traffic management. The Hagerty presentation talked up a \u201cstructured approach\u201d to rebuilding, \u201cresilience as an emerging recovery focus\u201d and \u201crecovery support functions.\u201d\nOn fire rebuild fees, Measure ULA\nPermit fees\nand taxes continue to make their way into rebuild discussions. Final decisions are hard to come by.\nCouncil member Traci Park, whose district includes the Palisades, revealed a lengthy document during Thursday\u2019s Palisades community meeting, called the \u201cPacific Palisades Vision.\u201d\nPark described the \u201cvision document\u201d as the culmination of months of conversations with residents at town halls, community meetings and other events.\nAmong her thoughts was an acknowledgement of the need to waive fees for property owners and renters. Park\u2019s stance on this is not new. Her motion passed earlier this year by the city\u2019s Ad Hoc Committee for L.A. Recovery needs to move through the Budget and Finance Committee next before consideration by the full Los Angeles City Council. Currently, the city has stopped collecting permit fees, but that is not permanent.\nThe idea could face a potentially uphill battle.\n\u201cThere is about a $90 million impact to the general fund to waive those fees,\u201d Park told residents during Thursday\u2019s meeting. \u201cThere will be discussion amongst my [city council] colleagues about whether we can do it. Can we afford to do it? Should we do it?\u201d\nPark made clear her opinion that permit fees should be done away with regardless of whether someone is building the same exact footprint or not.\nPark also acknowledged in her vision document what she called the \u201cdetrimental effects\u201d of the\nMeasure United to House L.A.\n2022 ballot measure, a property tax which applies to all real estate transactions in the city starting at $5.3 million. Those in real estate say it\u2019s done nothing but chill deals and development. In the Palisades it could prove another hurdle in the recovery.\nPark said she\u2019s working with L.A. Mayor Karen Bass and state lawmakers on a possible solution.\nNew attitudes on modular, prefab housing\nIt\u2019s not as though a raft of wildfire victims are enlisting modular or pre-fab housing manufacturers to get them back on their lots and inside\nfaster\nand cheaper. However, it\u2019s worth noting there\u2019s a growing contingent going that route.\nAbout 28 percent of those surveyed in late spring and early summer by Park\u2019s office in the Palisades said they\u2019re considering modular or prefab construction.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re hearing constantly are identical stories: People seeking us out because they\u2019re underinsured and they\u2019re looking for alternative ways to build aside from timber,\u201d said Mary O\u2019Brien, Hapi Homes\u2019 CEO and co-founder.\nHapi Homes has 30 rebuild clients in Altadena and Pasadena. RSG 3-D is counting between 40 and 50 homeowners who have architects and intend to use the company\u2019s panelized materials. Hapi Homes and RSG 3-D are what\u2019s known as\nmakers of panelized housing\nthat come in kits assembled on site at a resident\u2019s lot.\nWarring construction quotes\nAsk anyone how much it\u2019s going to cost to rebuild a home burned in the Palisades or Eaton fires and you\u2019ll get a different answer. That quote\u2019s also likely to change next month and the month after that.\nStill,\nOpus Builders\u2019 Gary Mkrtichyan\ncan\u2019t make some of the math on rebuilds that he\u2019s hearing pencil out. While Opus Builders \u2014 a construction company with its own in-house architecture and design services \u2014 charges $550 to $600 per square foot, Mkrtichyan hears all about some firms charging $700, $750 and beyond.\nPalisades residents estimated their construction costs averaging $800 per square foot in an Urban Land Institute-sponsored survey in the spring, while Altadena\u2019s mean was $580 per square foot.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not one client that I\u2019m charging $700 a square foot,\u201d Mkrtichyan said. \u201cI built three homes in the Palisades prior to the fires below that number. Now, OK, I understand there\u2019s been some appreciation. There\u2019s a labor shortage, especially with ICE [raids], but I know this is not the reason for these numbers people are talking about.\u201d\nBrad Pitt heads to Hollywood Hills\nBrad Pitt\n\u2019s moving, and so is The Killers guitarist Dave Keuning.\nThe \u201cF1 The Movie\u201d star earlier this week paid $12 million for a Hollywood Hills home sold by Keuning and his wife and interior designer Emilie Keuning.\nThat was a nice, double-ended deal for Carolwood Estates.\nThe Beverly Hills brokerage\u2019s David Parnes, Sam Collins and James Harris represented the Keunings. Meanwhile, Carolwood\u2019s Marci Kays and Jonathan Mogharrabi represented Pitt.\nMalibu\u2019s $80M trade\nAnyone have more details on the $80 million sale of\n28719 Grayfox Street\nin Malibu?\nThe multiparcel deal traded off market last month, per the deed, but it has limited liability companies on both sides of the transaction.\nAlso unclear is if the buyer and seller were represented by any agents in the deal, which is so far the priciest trade on record in Malibu this year.\nThe property consists of a 1.4-acre lot with a 1,300-square-foot residence, while the other lot is empty.\n",

        "content": "A Tom Ford, Moncler and Balenciaga-leased property on Rodeo Drive\nsold\nfor more than $400 million.\nRonan McNamee\u2019s ECA Capital Limited was the seller. The company purchased the 28,000-square-foot property at 338 North Rodeo Drive for $81.5 million in 2007 \u2014 and McNamee refinanced the property at $160 million six years ago. The identity of the buyer wasn\u2019t immediately known.\nThe deal is believed to be the second-highest sale ever in Beverly Hills, after Nicholas and Christian Candy\u2019s $500 million purchase of what was once a Robinson\u2019s-May department store in 2007. The 338 North Rodeo Drive sale could be a one-property record for the famed street, and the building may have fetched the lavish price because of its development potential.\nOther pricey retail sales along the iconic street include LVMH\u2019s $245 million purchase of a 22,300-square-foot, two-story double lot at 468 North Rodeo Drive; hotelier Efrem Harkham\u2019s $200 million sale of the 43,000-square-foot lot that held a boutique hotel plus three retail stores at 360 North Rodeo Drive; and Crown Equity\u2019s Michael Shabani\u2019s purchase of two storefronts spanning 11,600 square feet at 457-459 North Rodeo Drive for $112 million.\nCaruso for small businesses\nBillionaire Rick Caruso\u2019s nonprofit\nannounced\na $1 million donation from Banc of California\u2019s Wildfire Relief &amp; Recovery Fund for small businesses.\nThe small business initiative aims to support retailers, restaurants and other businesses in Altadena, Malibu and the Pacific Palisades impacted by the wildfires earlier this year via direct grants of up to $50,000.\n\u201cThese small businesses were about much more than commercial or economic activity. They were local hallmarks that gave neighborhoods their soul and fostered a sense of community,\u201d Caruso said. \u201cWe cannot abandon them. This is about ensuring they have the tools, resources and support they need to come back.\u201d\nThe businessman and once mayoral candidate\u2019s Pacific Palisades mall survived the fires thanks to private firefighters, but is closed because of the devastation surrounding it.\n\u201cThese businesses aren\u2019t faceless storefronts. They are the fabric of the community,\u201d Caruso said. \u201cThey are made up of people: owners, employees and loyal customers. They deserve an advocate to help address the challenges they\u2019re facing through no fault of their own. Through this initiative, they\u2019ll have one.\u201d\nMore losses at Hudson Pacific Properties\nHudson Pacific Properties has fallen on hard times.\nThe company\nreported\nan $83 million loss for the second quarter compared to a $47 million loss a year earlier.\nRevenues decreased to $190 million from $218 million a year ago because of declining office occupancies and discounted asset sales \u2014 that includes a San Francisco office building the company sold earlier this summer for $28 million, about half the $56.5 million Hudson Pacific purchased it for a decade ago.\nThe real estate investment trust\u2019s office revenues fell to $156 million in the three months ending June 30, compared to $176 million during the same period last year. Production studio revenues fared worse too, dropping to $34 million from $42 million year-over-year.\nHudson Pacific chair and CEO Victor Coleman, whose total compensation was valued at about $25 million last year despite ballooning losses, hinted at offloading more properties in the future and commended leasing during the company\u2019s earnings call.\n\nHudson Pacific executed 558,000 square feet in leases in the second quarter, a small increase from a year earlier. Second-quarter leases included a six-year, 77,000-square-foot renewal with a cybersecurity company in Foster City; a nine-year, 41,000-square-foot renewal with a digital sports company in Los Angeles; and a six-year, 32,000-square-foot new lease with a bio-tech company in Palo Alto.\nOffice-to-resi in Westood\nDouglas Emmett\nplans\nto turn an office tower it purchased for $131 million from Tishman Speyer through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure into apartments.\nThe 17-story, 247,000-square-foot office building at 10900 Wilshire Boulevard, coupled with a residential building Douglas Emmett plans to construct on the same lot, is set to become a 320-apartment complex in Westwood. The real estate investment trust\u2019s CEO, Jordan Kaplan, said he expects the conversion to enhance the property\u2019s value during its second-quarter earnings call. Still, the conversion will occur over an undisclosed number of years as offices are vacated on a floor-by-floor basis \u2014 and anticipated costs have increased.\n\u201cIncluding the costs to acquire the property, convert the existing office tower and construct the new building, we expect this plan to increase the total project costs to approximately $200 million to $250 million,\u201d the company said in an earnings release.\nBefore the planned conversion, the company expected the cost to be $150 million to $200 million, and that would include the acquisition, construction of the apartment building and upgrades to the existing tower.\nA loyal law firm\nLaw firm Behar Gibbs Savage Paulson\nrenewed\nits about 36,000-square-foot lease across two floors at One World Trade Center in Long Beach.\nBehar Gibbs Savage Paulson has occupied the top two floors of the 27-story, approximately 575,000-square-foot building for the last 35 years. The building\u2019s asking rents are between $2.95 to $3.15 per square foot per month.\nSince 2023, Los Angeles office absorption has been increasingly dominated by law firms and financial companies. The two years before, technology and entertainment companies led the way.\nFisher Phillips inked a new lease for about 36,000 square feet at 515 South Flower Street in Downtown Los Angeles \u2014 and an almost 14,000-square-foot lease at 21600 Oxnard Street in Woodland Hills last week. Paul Hastings, Hill, Farrer &amp; Burrill, Hanson Bridgett and Mayer Brown have renewed or signed new leases Downtown in recent years, too.\nArts District\u2019s all-in-one\nThe Los Angeles City Council\ngave\nthe green light for Danish architect Bjarke Ingels\u2019 mixed-use high-rise development in the Arts District.\nThe project at 670 Mesquit Street, which has been in the works for almost a decade, is set to hold four interconnected towers, the tallest of which would be 34 stories. The developer, Vella Group, plans to build 676,000 square feet of office space; 894 residential units; a 271-room hotel; a charter elementary school; and commercial spaces for retail, restaurant and art galleries.\nThe mixed-use campus will replace the Rancho Cold Storage facility owned for years by the Gallo family. Construction is expected to take place either over a single five-year period or in separate phases over nine years. A completion date has not yet been announced but total cost is estimated at $1.4 billion.\nIt was initially proposed as an office-heavy development but has shifted to mostly housing.\n",

        "content": "When U.S. Rep. Danny Davis announced he was not running for re-election, he became the third Congress person representing Illinois to do so this year. And because two U.S. Representatives are running to fill retiring U.S. Senator Dick Durbin\u2019s seat, a fourth position may end up vacant as well.\nThe Congressional shake up comes at a time when real estate players have a lot on the line. While rent growth in Chicago is\nbrewing a hot multifamily market,\nsluggish construction starts indicate that developers and lenders aren\u2019t as active as they could be. At the same time, Chicago\u2019s office market is stuck in a rut, reporting a record high 27 percent vacancy rate in the second quarter of this year. And the suburban office market\nisn\u2019t faring much better.\nAs a result, the industry is keeping a close watch on any potential political changes on the horizon.\nReal estate scion Jason Friedman\nposted the first fundraising numbers in the race to replace Davis and is coming away as an early favorite of the industry.\nProminent donors include Waterton CEO David Schwartz, Private Investment billionaire Craig Duchossois, CRG CEO Shawn Clark among others.\nDavis\u2019 district is of significant interest to real estate because it includes much of the Loop and Fulton Market.\n\nFriedman, son of prolific River North developer Albert Friedman, appears to be downplaying his ties to the business while campaigning. A press release characterized his $1 million fundraising haul as a collection of donations from \u201ccommunity leaders and grassroots supporters.\u201d And his website refers to his Chicagoan grandfather and great grandfather, but skips over his father, whose company he served as president of from 2005 until 2023.\nIn a Q&amp;A with\nThe Real Deal\n, however,\nFriedman embraced his industry experience\n.\nThe race ahead of the March 17 primaries will be where the real action plays out because the district is considered safely Democratic.\nAt least eight other challengers have recently joined the race, including state Rep. La Shawn Ford, who Davis endorsed last week. When the newer candidates report their fundraising totals next quarter,\u00a0 the results will likely reveal more nuances about other coalitions forming.\nMeanwhile, at the city level, it\u2019s politics as usual.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s administration\nclosed two investigations\nby the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development into the city of Chicago\u2019s zoning practices, a move that will likely end recent efforts to reform the informal practice of \u201caldermanic prerogative.\u201d\nLocal housing advocates had hoped the federal investigations would lead to reforming or ending aldermen\u2019s control over zoning in their respective wards. The investigations stemmed from a 2018 lawsuit that alleged such control led to racial segregation and dampened affordable housing development in wealthy, predominately white neighborhoods.\nThe city had already entered a voluntary agreement to negotiate a resolution after federal housing authorities found merit in the claims. Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s administration was reportedly near an agreement at the end of last year, but negotiations tapered off after Trump took office.",

        "content": "South San Francisco might stand as a shining beacon on a hill \u2014 or rather, several hills \u2014 for multifamily construction in the Bay Area.\nThe Peninsula city is\nbucking a trend\nof lagging apartment starts in the region with three large-scale residential projects underway. The latest proof of confidence from a lender came last month when Trammell Crow Residential secured a $183 million construction loan for its 480-unit Alexan Icon project at 1587 and 1588 San Mateo Avenue.\nTwo other large apartment developments have also broken ground in South San Francisco. Syres Properties is developing 400 units at 410 Noor Avenue while Essex Property Trust is building nearly 550 units at 7 South Linden Avenue.\n\u201cIt\u2019s significant that South San Francisco has three large multifamily developments underway,\u201d Nell Selander, economic and community development director for the city of South San Francisco, told the\nSan Francisco Business Times\n.\nNationwide and across the Bay Area, construction starts for apartment projects are at their slowest pace in 15 years, Jesse Gundersheim, senior director of market analytics at CoStar, told the Business Times.\nFarther south in Sunnyvale, a 147-unit apartment complex sold for nearly $70 million, pointing to possible increased demand for already-existing housing in Peninsula cities south of San Francisco.\nThe 5-acre\nCitra\napartment complex sale marked a more than $40 million profit from its 2014 price of $27 million. The property sold to San Francisco-based Prime Finance for $68.5 million, or about $466,000 per unit, higher than the five-year average multifamily property price in Santa Clara County of about $458,000 for such developments.\nSan Francisco rents bounce back post-pandemic\nFive years on from the pandemic, rents in San Francisco have nearly recovered all losses.\nMedian rental prices for two-bedroom apartments in San Francisco have surpassed levels from before the pandemic\u2019s outbreak, according to a new report from\nZumper\n. Last month, two-bedrooms in the city climbed to a monthly median listing price of $4,780, marking the highest point since August 2019. Median rents for one-bedrooms are close to reaching the same threshold at $3,400 per month, just under the $3,500 rate pre-pandemic.\nAn influx of new tech workers, likely driven by the proliferation of artificial intelligence company offices in the city, played a key part in the recent increase, according to Zumper spokesperson Crystal Chen. That sentiment is shared by AvalonBay Communities COO Sean Breslin, who\ntold investors\nin May that\nreturn-to-office mandates\nimproved public safety and AI-driven job growth has increased housing demand \u2014 and as a result, rents.\nSan Mateo skyline poised for transformation\nSan Mateo could soon claim a\nnew tallest tower\nin the city.\nMike Field of Mecah Ventures has filed formal permits to build a 14-story building at 1 East 4th Avenue in downtown San Mateo. The tower is projected to stand at 202 feet tall, edging out an office complex across the street at 400 South El Camino Real, also 14 stories tall but 165 feet high.\nPlans call for 174,700 square feet of housing and 119,760 square feet of commercial space with subterranean parking for 171 cars and 283 bicycles. The building would boast ground-floor retail, housing on the lower 10 floors, and offices on the top four floors with access to a rooftop balcony.\n\nOf the 236 rental units planned, 36 would be deed-restricted as affordable housing. Residents would have on-site amenities like a private lounge, spa, fitness center and a golf simulator.\nIf approved, the structure wouldn\u2019t be the tallest building in San Mateo County. That title belongs to the 317-foot-tall Genesis North Tower in South San Francisco, though N17\u2019s proposed 458-foot-tall building as part of its Willow Park mixed-use development in Menlo Park could beat it out.\nNvidia plants flag at Mission Rock\nMission Rock is set to receive another major tenant: the world\u2019s most valuable company.\nNvidia is reportedly\nin talks\nto lease 45,000 square feet in the eight-story office building at the site in Mission Bay, joining Coinbase and the Golden State Warriors at the tower.\nAs the company\u2019s value balloons past $4 trillion, the Santa Clara-based chipmaker has been growing its footprint in the Bay Area. This year alone, it\ndropped $123 million\nfor a 10-building office campus across the street from its Santa Clara headquarters and additionally\nbought a 500,000-square-foot\n, four-building office complex in the South Bay city.\nThe move has been in the works for some time, as the company was reportedly looking for a 30,000-square-foot sales office in San Francisco in May, according to the\nSan Francisco Chronicle\n.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang is doubling down on San Francisco, home to artificial intelligence giants OpenAI and Anthropic,\nsaying\nthe city is \u201cthriving again\u2026 all because of AI.\u201d\nThe AI sector is expected to gobble up 21 million square feet of offices and attract as many as 60,000 new employees to San Francisco over the next five years, according to a report from\nCBRE\n.\nSaratoga winery to become cemetery\nSavannah-Chanelle Vineyards in Santa Clara County is headed for a spooky redevelopment.\nLongtime owners Michael and Kellie Ballard sold the 57.9-acre winery outside Saratoga to the Saratoga Cemetery District for $20 million.\nThe cemetery manager has been preparing to expand in the area. In April, the district\nbought\na house next to Madronia Cemetery for $4.5 million. But the district has had its eye on the Savannah-Chanelle land for some time.\n\u201cThis is the one we\u2019ve always wanted,\u201d Steve Albright, general manager of Madronia Cemetery, told the\nSan Francisco Business Journal\nof the vineyard purchase. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on this one for about a year.\u201d\nThe\nSaratoga\nCemetery District will spend the next 20 years paying off debt to secure the property as it prepares to turn the nearly 60-acre plot into another cemetery. The winery won\u2019t be going anywhere for a while, though; the Cemetery District is leasing the property to Savannah-Chanelle, which will continue to operate for at least the next 10 years before the cemetery takes over and redevelops the land.\n",

        "content": "North of Dallas, a controversial master-planned community called EPIC City is in the works \u2014 a vision led by Imran Chaudhary to create a multigenerational Muslim neighborhood anchored by a mosque.\nTexas Bureau Chief Jess Hardin took a\ndeep dive into EPIC City\nfor the\nAugust issue\nof\nThe Real Deal\nmagazine.\nThe 400-acre project, named after the East Plano Islamic Center, aims to address housing affordability and cultural cohesion, but it\u2019s drawn fierce backlash from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and right-wing influencers who\u2019ve baselessly claimed the community would impose Sharia law.\nDespite the political firestorm and investigations by multiple state agencies, EPIC City\u2019s backers have pressed on, selling $40 million worth of shares to fund the development. While religious communities like Ave Maria in Florida and Veritatis Splendor in East Texas have developed with less scrutiny, EPIC City has become a flashpoint in the debate over who gets to build faith-based communities in America.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice closed its investigation into the community in June, and the developers plan to submit formal proposals to county officials by year\u2019s end.\nTRD\nTexas Reporter Isaiah Mitchell\u2019s magazine piece this month dug into the explosive growth in the country\u2019s fastest-growing town, Princeton, through the\nstory of one entrepreneur\nwho\u2019s making a mark there.\n\nFormer Dallas Mavericks player-turned-country singer Ray Johnston stumbled into a goldmine when he bought 138 acres outside of Princeton just before the town started blowing up. But he also did a ton of work on the ground. Johnston navigated local resistance by personally securing 26 easements from wary neighbors, smoothing the path for sewer lines and a profitable land sale to homebuilders like Lennar. His charm offensive \u2014 which included gift baskets and guitar pick-shaped business cards \u2014 paid off, turning a passive investment into a hands-on win as Princeton grappled with infrastructure lags and development pressure.\nHere\u2019s what else happened in Texas real estate this week:\nFresh off a $343 million capital raise, Dallas-based multifamily syndicator S2 Capital is expanding into industrial real estate with the\nacquisition of Fort Capital\nand its 11 million-square-foot portfolio. The move, driven by e-commerce demand and transportation costs, adds a new vertical led by Chris Roach and Parker McCormack, as S2 continues navigating market volatility better than many of its syndicator peers.\nOne Riverway, an office building in Houston\u2019s Galleria area, is still hemorrhaging tenants despite a recent recap deal to avoid foreclosure. Law firm Wright Close &amp; Barger is\nthe latest to exit\n, taking 41,000 square feet at TC Energy Center downtown and adding to One Riverway\u2019s vacancy woes after another major law firm departed last year.\nAn $8.75 million\nmansion in Southlake\ncracked Texas\u2019 most-expensive home listings, standing out in a ranking typically dominated by Dallas and Houston estates. The 8,000-square-foot property sits on 3.7 gated acres with a sports court, pool, barn and six-car garage. The seller is Grapevine businessman Monty Patterson, and broker Michael Hershenberg of Hershenberg Group has the listing.\nTexas cities are scrambling to\nblunt the impact of Senate Bill 840\n, which takes effect Sept. 1 and allows by-right residential development in nonresidential zones. In Arlington, planners are proposing rules \u2014 including six-story minimums, mandatory balconies and electrical vehicle charging \u2014 that critics say are designed to block the very kind of infill housing the law aimed to encourage. Other cities like Plano, Frisco and Irving are reportedly plotting similar workarounds.\n",

It\u2019s been seven years since Miami-Dade County commissioners approved a massive rezoning that paved the way for the project.\nThe project, which was supposed to be completed in 2022, hasn\u2019t gotten off the ground.\nFrancisco Alvarado\nlooks at why and what\u2019s next for the development in our latest issue.\nThe mall is facing legal challenges, and the developer says it needs the county to lift its ban on Triple Five securing subsidies that would help pay for road construction. The latter could be addressed by the county commission next month.\nThe project is pretty ambitious \u2014 Triple Five Group, led by cousins Paul and Don Ghermezian, plans to transform 175 acres sandwiched between two major highways in Miami-Dade into a water park, 3-D cinema multiplex, 2,000 hotel rooms and (I saved the best part for last) a 16-story indoor ski slope. It would be larger than the Ghermezians\u2019 Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, which is the biggest mall in the U.S.\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like the Ghermezians are too concerned. Miami-Dade filed a lawsuit against the developer earlier this year, and Triple Five agreed to pay a $5 million penalty in four installments beginning next year. As part of the settlement, Triple Five now has until 2045 to complete the project \u2014 so 20 years from now.\nPaul Ghermezian confirmed the company\u2019s long-term strategy in an\ninterview\nwith\nThe Real Deal\nearlier this year.\nPlus, there\u2019s the issue of\u2026 who else would build it?\nShlomo Chopp with Case Equity Partners said it\u2019s either them, or Disney.\n\u201cDisney already has Orlando,\u201d Chopp said.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat would you like to see in the 2045 version of American Dream Miami?

Five of those properties are in Broward and Palm Beach counties, three are in Kissimmee, one is in Tampa and another is in Charleston.

The drop in contracts mirrored a similar slump in South Florida, with Miami-Dade County logging just 12 pending deals.\nThe drop could mean luxury buyers are just out on summer vacation or it could be the first inkling of a glacial third quarter \u2014 typically the residential market\u2019s slowest period.\nBut the number of signed contracts could also be undercounted, as the total may not include homes marketed as private exclusives or deals inked off-market at new development properties such as 80 Clarkson.\nThe jury\u2019s still out on how the rest of August will fare, but contract activity in Manhattan was off to a strong start ahead of the month. In July, the number of pending deals for condos, co-ops and one- to three-family homes asking $4 million or more rose to 91, up more than 12 percent compared to the same month last year, according to Miller Samuel\u2019s monthly report.\nThe uptick in signed contracts will likely translate to closed deals in the third quarter, but luxury activity outpaced new listings hitting the market during the month. Without enough inventory for buyers to scoop up, a deal slowdown could be on the horizon.\nNew listings for homes asking $4 million or more fell 13 percent last month, dropping from 129 to 112.\nThe Upper East Side notched the largest number of recorded transactions in July, with 193 deals, according to data from Streeteasy. The deals came after an active June in the neighborhood\u2019s luxury market, which saw 36 contracts inked, up 16 percent from the same month last year.\nNot so fast\u2026\n\nResidential brokerages closed out the second quarter earnings season with mixed results.\nThree of the sector\u2019s largest firms found different footing as macroeconomic conditions, including persistently high mortgage rates and uncertainty sparked by tariffs, slowed the housing market.\nCompass\nfinished the period\nin the black, reporting more than $39 million in net income \u2014 a 90 percent year-over-year increase compared to the same quarter last year, according to its earnings report. The company also logged record quarterly revenue at more than $2 billion, a 21 percent annual uptick.\nWhile Compass posted gains, Anywhere Real Estate\nheld the line\n. The parent company of brands such as Corcoran, Coldwell Banker and Sotheby\u2019s International reported a net income of $27 million, just $3 million less than it earned in the same period in 2024. Its revenue was $1.7 billion, up 1 percent from the second quarter last year.\nBut Douglas Elliman\u2019s earnings\ntook a turn\nfor the worst. The firm posted a $23 million loss \u2014 $21 million more than it lost in the second quarter last year \u2014 and reversed months of revenue gains, bringing in $270 million compared to $285 million in 2024. The period was a departure from the upward trajectory Elliman started on in the first quarter.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe priciest sale to land in the city register this week was a three-bedroom resale at Extell Development and Aabar Investment\u2019s 157 West 57th Street. Unit 66B at the Billionaires\u2019 Row tower, known as One57, traded for $24 million \u2014 $2 million below its asking price when it hit the market in April. The 4,200-square-foot condo sold for $19 million in 2021.\nMichael Balanevsky and Artur Fruman of Accent Holdings had the listing.\n",

        "content": "For rent-stabilized buildings whose finances have collapsed, owners might have only one way out: deregulation through demolition or substantial rehabilitation.\nOwners are increasingly asking about this, according to a\nLinkedIn post\nby real estate lawyer Sherwin Belkin.\nHis message could be an attempt to drum up business, but Belkin says he is \u201cabsolutely getting many more inquiries.\u201d There is every reason to believe him.\nNot only is distress among rent-stabilized buildings rising (because\ninterest rates\nand\noperating costs\nhave risen, rent increases have\nlagged\nand\nhousing court is broken\n), but their outlook became even more dismal with the mayoral primary victory by Assembly member\nZohran Mamdani\n, who promises\nto freeze their rents\nfor four years.\nThe distress is concentrated in fully or largely rent-stabilized buildings. When Mamdani talks about landlords\u2019 profits rising 12 percent, he omits that this is driven by properties that have lucrative market-rate units mixed in. Purely rent-stabilized buildings are\ndoing much worse\n, in some cases declaring bankruptcy or facing\nforeclosure\n.\nAn uptick in inquiries about sub rehab and demolition, however, does not necessarily mean more projects are happening. Among the requirements: Buildings must be in bad physical condition and mostly vacant before the rehab begins (which is an incentive to not maintain a building).\nBuyouts backfire\nGetting approval from the state\u2019s Division of Homes and Community Renewal is difficult because the agency sees preserving affordable housing as part of its mission. Also, the legislature got rid of a policy that presumed buildings qualify if vacancy is at least 80 percent.\nThat change took effect Jan. 1, 2024, but even projects that began before that date are held to extraordinary scrutiny by HCR.\nTake 117 North Fourth Street in Williamsburg, which an entity called Creas Inc bought for $9.75 million in 2023 from an LLC linked to\nJeff Sutton\n\u2019s Wharton Properties, property records show. (Traded identified the buyer as the\nCras family\n.)\nJudging from the price and the building\u2019s history, the buyer assumed the 2022 sub-rehab application would be approved. The building was entirely vacant and the applicant had submitted photos of its poor condition before replacing more than the minimum 75 percent of its major systems.\n\nBut in January 2024, HCR denied the application, saying the rehab did not meet its\ncriteria\n. Remarkably, one reason given for the denial was that the three tenants who vacated had accepted buyouts ranging from $150,000 to $175,000.\nThese amounts, the agency claimed, proved that the apartments were valuable and not in bad shape \u2014 an absurd claim. The payouts were six figures because the building\u2019s value would triple if it could escape rent regulation, which required vacancy. If occupied, the units were worth little.\nThe agency also argued that the \u201cbefore\u201d photos were not dated and the locations of the captured images were not well documented, making it unclear that the four-story building was substandard or seriously deteriorated just before the renovation.\nState law says nothing about buyouts disqualifying a property. HCR\u2019s criteria don\u2019t even mention them. \u201cHaving bought a tenant out is not probative or even relevant to the physical condition of the building,\u201d said Belkin, who followed the case but was not involved in it.\nThe owner asked HCR to review its initial ruling, but the agency upheld it, as did\nstate Supreme Court Justice Gina Abadi\non July 1. Whether an appeal will succeed is anyone\u2019s guess.\nNo tenants had objected to the deregulation of 117 North Fourth Street. Rather, HCR decided on its own to rebut the presumption that the building\u2019s 100 percent vacancy did not make it eligible.\nBuyer in a bind\nThe court\u2019s\nruling\nthat the building shall remain rent-stabilized leaves Creas in a horrendous position. The buyer borrowed $6.1 million from Valley National Bank for the deal, but the most it could collect in rent \u2014 perhaps $150,000 a year \u2014 would only pay about half of the debt service. Operating expenses and property taxes would add to the red ink.\nCreas\u2019 $3.65 million down payment looks like a total loss. Valley National might lose even more. Whether it forecloses on the building or sells the loan, it can expect pennies on the dollar. The only winners here appear to be Sutton, whose firm paid $2.8 million for the unmortgaged building in July 2020, four months into the pandemic, and Andrzej Trojanowski, the seller in that deal.\nThis is a cautionary tale, but taking a shot at a sub rehab still makes sense if the alternative is watching a building\u2019s value decline until it becomes impossible to refinance or simply worthless.\nLandlords\u2019 strategy of asking the state legislature to amend the 2019\nHousing Stability and Tenant Protection Act\nhas not worked, outside of getting a modest rent increase for individual apartment improvements.\nThe upshot: If a sub rehab or demolition is a building\u2019s only way out of a\nfinancial death spiral\n, cutting corners on the application could be fatal. Better to hire an expert. Preferably someone who will date the photos.\n",

The firm\u2019s development arm focuses on industrial property in Texas, primarily in Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston, and the investment arm of the firm has industrial assets around the country.\nThe platform follows development firm Eider Creek Capital, a venture Doherty launched in 2020. Prior to these enterprises, Doherty spent 22 years at Crow Holdings, where he helped lead the company\u2019s investment team and grow its industrial and self-storage platforms. Doherty leads investment strategy, governance and capital formation at Eider Creek.\nHafner also comes from Crow Holdings, where he spent 12 years overseeing development, acquisitions and asset management. Between 2017 and 2018, Hafner was a partner at Panattoni Development Company. He oversees development and asset management.\n\nBaird has 30 years of cumulative experience at Cushman &amp; Wakefield, HFF and, most recently, CBRE, where he served as vice chair. At Eider Creek, Baird oversees portfolio planning, valuations and institutional capital.\nHere\u2019s what else is shaking in Texas real estate.\nCommercial real estate broker Cynthia Cowen joined Florida-based Foundry Commercial as senior vice president of the firm\u2019s Mission Property Group, a division that exclusively focuses on religious, educational and other mission-driven nonprofits. Cowen spent 15 years on a Cousins Properties team that was acquired by Cushman &amp; Wakefield, where she continued to work for over seven years. She left Cushman in May.\u00a0Commercial broker Mac Morse was awarded SIOR office designation from the Society of Industrial and Office Realtors recently, a formal recognition of a broker\u2019s experience, education and ethical reputation. Morse was previously recognized as a\n\u201cpower broker\u201d by D CEO from 2021 to 2023. Morse, a Metroplex native, has spent the entirety of his career at Citadel Partners. He\u2019s been a partner at the company since October.\n",

The house at 1680 North Doheny Drive had an original listing price of $43 million in January 2024,\nThe Real Deal\nreported.\nAn LLC connected to Australian developer Caydon Property Group developed the mansion, based on property records.\nPerched on a hillside with sweeping views of the Sunset Strip, the home is a modern architectural glass house designed by Vantage Design Group. Its technology-focused features include retractable glass walls, drought-tolerant landscaping, two elevators and climate-controlled wine rooms. The residence also features an eco-friendly solar system, eight bathrooms, five bedrooms and a media room with an LED wall and bar.\n\nGuo, who co-founded Scale AI in 2016 before launching her own platform, Passes, in 2022, has a net worth of $1.3 billion, according to Forbes. Her stake in Scale AI, which she retained after leaving the company in 2018 due to differences of opinion with co-founder Alexandr Wang, is now worth a fortune following the company\u2019s recent valuation surge. Meanwhile, Passes has raised $50 million in two years from investors.\nBarron and Tessa Hilton represented Guo in the deal, while Compass agents Ginger Glass and Craig Lotzof held the listing.\nThis is Guo\u2019s third known real estate purchase. In 2021, she bought a $6.7 million condominium in a Zaha Hadid-designed Miami tower. The 4,727-square-foot residence features four bedrooms, 5.5 bathrooms, a movie theater, rooftop helipad and beach views. In 2024, she picked up a modern farmhouse in L.A. for $4.2 million.

The couple recently decided not to move and remain in New York where they regularly work, listing agent Eric Moreland of Moreland Properties told the Wall Street Journal.\nThe original asking price was $26.5 million but recently got cut\u00a0 to $23.5 million. The final purchase has not been publicly disclosed.\nIf the $23.5 million ask held it will be among the priciest residential deals in the city limits sold recently, according to Realtor.com data. The next closest price in Austin currently on the market is $19.5 million.\nThe Tarrytown listing sits on 1.24 acres along a live oak-shaded street, and the redesign features work by architecture firm Cuppett Kilpatrick. In addition to the main five-bedroom house and two-bedroom guest house, there are several living spaces with various uses, such as an outdoor kitchen, office, dining room, solarium, large kitchen, breakfast bar and more, according to Moreland\u2019s listing.\n\nLeaded glass windows, marble fireplace, brick and herringbone oak floors and arched doorways are just some of the home\u2019s features. There is also a paneled library, playroom and a screening room with a bar.\nRenovations were still under construction when the home was originally listed, but work was reportedly due to be finished by the end of summer. County records log over $11 million in improvements in the years since the couple purchased the home, including $3.5 million this year alone. The home\u2019s taxable value was most recently appraised at $7.3 million.\nThe New York City apartment that serves as Stone and McCary\u2019s primary residence is understood to be worth about $12 million, according to Realtor.com.\nStone has a track record of profitable real estate flips. In 2022, she sold her Malibu blufftop home for $4.425 million after buying it for $3.25 million in 2018. In 2023, she sold another Los Angeles property for $4.3 million \u2014 nearly double what she paid in 2019.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Distress is growing in New York\u2019s rent-stablized housing stock.\nOne school of thought says that distress is the result of bad actors \u2014 speculative buyers, aggressive lenders \u2014 and elevated interest rates.\nBut some data has begun to run counter to that narrative. It\u2019s not just risk-seeking buyers that are getting hit, according to a recent report from nonprofit lender Community Preservation Corp.\nEven affordable housing projects that borrowed money at fixed interest rates are seeing signs of distress. Many of those are owned by not-for-profit landlords who have regulatory agreements with the city. In CPC\u2019s portfolio, which is 100 percent rent-stabilized, foreclosures, delinquencies and financial trouble have all grown in recent years.\nThe number of foreclosures has increased eightfold since 2022, while the delinquency rate has more than doubled. Nearly 30 percent of buildings don\u2019t make enough in operating income to fully service their debt.\nThe numbers hint that distress in the rent-stabilized housing stock, brought on by high interest rates, rising expenses and tenant-friendly statewide laws, will not be contained. With a rent freeze as a central promise of Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani\u2019s campaign for mayor, players like CPC are concerned that the most affordable units with the lowest-income tenants will feel the squeeze first.\n\u201cYou think, \u2018Well, if we put stuff in the hands of not-for-profits with long-term fixed-rate debt, everything will be okay,\u2019\u201d said Robert Riggs, senior vice president and New York regional director at CPC. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nCPC\u2019s portfolio avoids many of the issues that trap other rent-stabilized buildings into a distress loop. The buildings carry fixed-rate debt, so they\u2019re not affected by rising interest rates, and very little of it \u2014 about $60,000 per unit.\nBut those homes are more susceptible to rising expenses because they have less room to grow their rents. A 2 percent increase on $1,000 doesn\u2019t go as far as the same increase on $2,000.\nThe foreclosures and delinquencies for CPC\u2019s portfolio are still fairly low compared to what\u2019s happening elsewhere in the industry. But they are trending in the wrong direction. Foreclosures have increased from 2 in 2023 to 16 at the end of last year, while delinquencies have risen from about 3 percent to 8 percent in that same time.\nCPC also surveys its borrowers about their finances. Of respondents, 28 percent did not have the operating income to fully cover their debt.\nFor the five years ending last December, expenses per unit increased by 22 percent. Some of that was driven by property insurance costs, which increased 52 percent in that time.\n\u201cThe most pain, in terms of the building and the viability of the asset, is going to be inflicted upon the most affordable buildings,\u201d Riggs said.\n",

        "content": "New York developers are moving fast to embrace an unlikely source for badly needed housing: hotels that until recently housed migrants.\nMore than a dozen former shelters are being eyed for residential conversions, potentially delivering thousands of apartments, the Wall Street Journal\nreported\n. At least 1,100 units are already in the works, including the 318-unit Baisley Pond Park Residences in Queens, converted from a Hilton near JFK, and a 535-unit affordable housing project at the Stewart Hotel in Midtown.\nStudent housing, market-rate rentals and affordable units are all on the table as developers seize on what they say is a rare, time-sensitive opening.\nThe pipeline is driven partly by the city\u2019s winding down of its hotel shelter program. At its peak in early 2024, the city was housing more than 54,000 migrants in 160 hotels, spending $8 billion since 2022 to meet its right-to-shelter obligations. With arrivals slowing and all but four emergency shelters closed, only the 1,331-room Row NYC is still in use among the hotels.\nMany of the shuttered hotels aren\u2019t likely to reopen for lodging; Vijay Dandapani, president of the Hotel Association of New York City, estimated 40 percent at most would come back, citing pandemic-era wear and tear, costly renovations and the stigma of shelter use.\nConverting hotels to apartments is generally faster and cheaper than ground-up construction, thanks to existing bathrooms and natural light in each room. Still, zoning and building code hurdles loom large, and the city\u2019s past efforts under the 2021 Housing Our Neighbors With Dignity Act have struggled to gain traction.\n\nDevelopers say the economics can work if the building layout cooperates \u2014 combining three hotel rooms into one apartment is common \u2014 and if purchase prices stay well below the cost of reopening.\nBeyond adding units in a city with a record-low 1.4 percent vacancy rate, the conversions could pump new life into lagging commercial districts. Advocates say the projects could also embed social services into the housing.\nWhether the momentum sticks may hinge on political will. Housing shortages are dominating the mayoral race and developers are betting the city will keep looking at conversions as a quick, if partial, fix.\nThe mood in the sector is summed up by Slate Property Group\u2019s David Schwartz: \u201cThe opportunity is right now.\u201d\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The filing outlines plans for an 80-unit complex offering assisted living and memory care. The property is owned by the Perusina Family Trust, founded by the late Danford Perusina.\nThe conversion would involve only limited exterior changes and interior renovations to accommodate the new use. No specific timeline was disclosed.\nIndustry experts say the move reflects broader shifts in the Bay Area\u2019s lodging sector rather than issues with the Aloft brand, according to the Mercury News.\nAlan Reay, principal executive with consultancy Atlas Hospitality Group, noted that many hotel owners are reevaluating their assets as the Bay Area hotel market faces increasing challenges. In some cases, he said, converting properties to specialized uses like senior care could yield higher returns than continuing as a hotel.\n\n\u201cThis conversion plan is more of a reflection of the current hotel market rather than problems with the [Aloft] brand,\u201d Reay said.\nOther notable hotels in the regional market have completed conversions, including the southern tower of the two-building Signia by Hilton in San Jose. That 264-room building was acquired by Throckmorton Partners and transformed into a 700-bed student housing complex for San Jose State University, which opened in August 2024.\nIf approved, the Aloft conversion would add to a growing list of adaptive reuse projects, signaling a shift in how owners are reimagining hospitality assets amid evolving market conditions.\nShashi Group manages several other Silicon Valley properties, including the Shashi Hotel in Mountain View, the Aloft Sunnyvale and The Nest Palo Alto.\n\u2014Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "A lender has taken control of a four-story building at 244 Jackson Street in San Francisco following a foreclosure auction on July 31.\nThe lender named JPMBB 2014-C22 Jackson Street LLC, listed in state records with an address at Starwood Capital Group\u2019s Miami office, now owns the 29,700-square-foot property, built in 1913, which currently stands vacant but previously housed office and retail tenants, the\nSan Francisco Business Times reported\n.\nThe building\u2019s prior owner, Roth Jackson LLC \u2014 controlled by father-and-son\npartnership Moris and David Herscowitz \u2014 acquired the property in 2018 for $33 million, or about $1,100 per square foot. At the time, it was backed by a $13.6 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan originated by Barclays in 2014. That loan went into default after maturing in June 2024.\nFollowing an attempted sale that fell through earlier this year, the lender stepped in at auction with a credit bid of just under $10 million, substantially below the outstanding debt and associated costs, which totaled more than $16 million.\n\nThe lender\u2019s acquisition does not necessarily reflect the property\u2019s market value, as credit bids benefit from existing debt compared to an actual purchase offer. The building\u2019s most recent appraisal in August 2024 valued it at $13.3 million, according to the Business Times.\nSince the default, Colliers has served as the court-appointed receiver, effectively managing the property on behalf of the lender. It is expected that the building will soon list for sale.\nThe Jackson Square market, known for its luxury retail stores, has seen a resurgence lately with interest from both investors and tenants. The neighborhood, located near the iconic Transamerica Pyramid, has recently attracted the artificial intelligence giant OpenAI (which acquired former Apple designer Jony Ive\u2019s\nstartup\n), furniture company Branch and luxury brands such as Ralph Lauren and Paul Smith, along with Michelin-starred chef Peter Hemsley. The building at 244 Jackson is located between Jackson Square and the city\u2019s Financial District, according to the Business Times.\n\u2014Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "A health care construction boom has hit the Bay Area, caused by California\u2019s looming 2030 seismic safety deadline and a changing care delivery model that favors smaller, more specialized facilities alongside major hospital upgrades.\nData from the California Department of Health Care Access and Information shows total construction costs for health care projects in the nine-county region reached $2.67 billion in October 2024, the\nSan Francisco Business Times reported\n. That figure is short of the $4.2 billion peak in 2017, but it\u2019s the highest since the pandemic.\nSutter Health\u2019s $422 million, five-story neuroscience complex at 3555 Cesar Chavez Street sits inside its Mission Bernal campus and looms as one of the region\u2019s largest active projects. Breaking ground in June and slated to open in 2028, the facility will consolidate key neurology services, including the Ray Dolby Brain Health Center and Forbes Norris MDA/ALS Research and Treatment Center, and serve as a regional neurosurgery and stroke hub.\nOther major undertakings include Sutter\u2019s planned $1 billion, 1.3-million-square-foot Emeryville hospital; UCSF Health\u2019s $3.8 billion, 900,000-square-foot Helen Diller Hospital at Parnassus; Kaiser Permanente\u2019s 303-bed San Jose Medical Center; and UCSF Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital Oakland\u2019s $300 million seismic rebuild.\n\nAlongside these megaprojects are smaller sites. Sutter\u2019s 11,000-square-foot Livermore care center, opened in June and designed by HED with construction by Skanska USA, offers pediatric and adult exam corridors, imaging and lab services. It\u2019s part of a rollout of 14 similar centers over two years, leveraging standardized designs to speed delivery and reduce costs.\nInterior patient-focused upgrades are also evident at Stanford Medicine Children\u2019s Health\u2019s Bass Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Diseases. Its newly opened outpatient clinic and infusion center now has 14 exam rooms and 15 private infusion bays, accommodating 25,000 annual visits, including 7,000 infusions for children with cancer and other blood disorders.\nWhether large or small, those projects are racing against the seismic compliance clock while aiming to improve patient access and outcomes. As Christina Oh, Sutter\u2019s Greater San Francisco president, put it: Success hinges on \u201cseeing more patients faster\u201d while maintaining clinical excellence and cutting-edge research.\n\u2014Joel Russell\n",

        "content": "The plan to turn the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center into a revitalized mixed-use campus took a big hit last week.\nEmpire State Development and local officials in Queens announced a deal last week to cut the number of housing units proposed for the long-vacant site, the Queens Daily Eagle\nreported\n. Negotiations between the two sides stemmed from opposition about the density of the state\u2019s project.\nOriginally slated for\nmore than 2,800 homes\n, the compromise cuts roughly 850 units from the proposal. A majority of the units in the development were earmarked for ownership, while hundreds were rentals. The reduction leaves slightly more than 2,000 units in the plan.\nFive of the planned eight-story buildings were also axed from the proposal. The agreement will lead to a 27 percent decrease in overall unit square footage and a 15 percent reduction in units allocated for individuals with mental illnesses.\n\u201cWe believe these adjustments demonstrate our commitment to create a project that responds to comments expressed by yourselves and community members and that provides housing which will enable young adults to stay in their neighborhoods with their family support system, allow seniors to age in place, and create new homeownership opportunities,\u201d said ESD chief executive officer Hope Knight.\n\nIt\u2019s not immediately clear how other parts of the original proposal \u2014 retail space, an early childhood center, an older-adult facility and a school \u2014 will be affected by the downsized scale of the project.\nGov. Kathy Hocul initially unveiled plans for the redevelopment at the end of 2023, a sprawling 58-acre project to replace vacant land, buildings and parking lots.\nCreedmoor dates back to 1912, when it opened as a satellite facility of Brooklyn State Hospital. It started as a psychiatric \u201cfarm colony\u201d where patients took part in daily work as part of a therapy regimen.\nThe full campus spans 125 acres. Most of its buildings \u2014 19 out of 25 \u2014 are vacant. Various state-led agencies are expected to continue providing services to patients on the remaining 67 acres at Creedmoor.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Manhattan\u2019s luxury market rebounded last week following a lull in inked deals.\nBuyers signed 22 contracts for homes in the borough asking $4 million or more between Aug. 4 and Aug. 10, up from just nine in the\nprevious period\n, according to Olshan Realty\u2019s weekly report.\nLeading the charge was a penthouse at Aurora Capital Associates\u2019 140 Jane Street, which last asked close to\n$88 million\n. The condo, which Nikkie Field of Sotheby\u2019s International told\nThe Real Deal\nsold to an unknown buyer from a Zoom presentation, will span 9,500 square feet and include six bedrooms, seven bathrooms and a wraparound terrace overlooking the Hudson River.\nIf Unit PH8 closes at that price, it would set a new record for a Downtown Manhattan condo sale, surpassing a\n$60 million deal for a unit at 150 Charles\n, a\n$73 million deal for a townhouse\non West 11th Street and Jeff Bezos\u2019 purchase of a penthouse and two other apartments for\n$80 million\n.\nField brought the buyer, while the developer was represented by a Corcoran Sunshine team led by Tara King-Brown.\nAurora Capital has sold all but one of the 15 units at the building, which is scheduled to be completed in 2027. The condos snagged contracts at an average asking price of\u00a0 $5,600 per square foot. Amenities in the 11-story building include a doorman, port-cochere, lap pool and parking garage.\n\nThe second most expensive home to land a signed contract was an Upper East Side townhouse, with an asking price just under $45 million. The home at 10 East 67th Street, built in 1881, once belonged to financier and art collector Jules Bache in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nThe seven-story mansion last traded in 2006 for $29 million when investment banker Gerhard Andlinger and his wife Jeanne sold it to a buyer whose identity is shielded by an anonymous LLC. The 13,000-square-foot property was renovated 15 years ago.\nIt has seven bedrooms and 13 bathrooms and has an elevator, rooftop glass atrium and seven fireplaces.\nSerhant\u2019s Ryan Serhant and Melissa Post had the listing.\nOf the 22 properties, 16 were condos, two were co-ops and four were townhouses.\nThe homes\u2019 combined asking price was $283 million, for an average price of $12.9 million and a median of $5.9 million. The typical home spent more than 640 days on the market and was discounted 5 percent from the original listing price.\n",

Business First\nreported. The Santa Fe Avenue offices were the former headquarters of Lucky Brand, known for its jeans and other clothing and accessories. DTLA Law Group\u2019s new home is set to open Sept. 1.\nThe new offices will more than double its current footprint from 25,000 square feet to a renovated 52,000-square-foot space. Employees will be able to enjoy open workspaces and private rooms in the new offices and take advantage of building amenities like a cafe, lounges and conference rooms.\nAs part of the expansion, DTLA Law Group plans to add new attorneys and expand its litigation footprint, according to the company, which is making the move in the wake of ICE raids that roiled through the immigrant-rich city.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about expanding our mission and making sure that working people, immigrants, families and everyday Angelenos have access to the same level of legal firepower as the most powerful institutions in this city,\u201d Farid Yaghoubtil, founder of DTLA Law Group, said in a\nstatement\n.\n\nLaw firms are among the so-called traditional companies that have grown their foothold in the Greater Los Angeles office market in recent years. Between 2021 and 2023, tech and entertainment companies were ahead of the pack in grabbing office space, but since then, law firms have been some of the biggest players in office absorption, according to\nAvison Young\n.\nLast month, Atlanta-based labor and employment law firm\nFisher Phillips\nsigned a new lease for 35,744 square feet at 515 South Flower Street in Downtown Los Angeles as well as a new 13,624-square-foot lease at 21600 Oxnard Street in Woodland Hills. Fisher Phillips will join fellow law firm Paul Hastings when it opens its new offices at the 52-story City National Plaza tower in downtown Los Angeles.\nLast week, law firm\nBehar Gibbs Savage Paulson\nrenewed its 35,754-square-foot lease on two floors at One World Trade Center in Long Beach. Asking rent in the building ranges from $2.95 to $3.15 per square foot per month.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Concord Summit Capital\u2019s Robert Horton and George Smith Partners\u2019 Justin Piasecki arranged the financing.\nThe development, located in the southern end of the largely residential Echo Park District adjacent to Downtown L.A., totals about 86,500 square feet and includes studios, one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments. The apartments are deed-restricted at 80 percent, meaning households can only earn up to 80 percent of the median income; in Los Angeles County that would be $84,500 for a single person, $96,950 for two, $109,050 for three and so on,\naccording to\nthe Department of Regional Planning\u2019s income limits.\n\nThe 189-apartment development at 1540 West Court Street benefits from Mayor Karen Bass\u2019 Executive Directive 1 (ED1), which aims to streamline the approval process for affordable housing.\nThe basketball players turned developers have two other Echo Park\nprojects\n: one at 1230 West Sunset Boulevard and the other at 333 Douglas Street. The latter is set to be 33 apartments, spanning about 22,000 square feet \u2014 and the former, 87 apartments and around 42,000 square feet but is not yet under construction. Visionary Developments has a mixed-use project in Silver Lake that is under planning review, too.\nLos Angeles\u2019 multifamily market ended the first quarter of the year with a 95.4 percent occupancy rate,\naccording to\na CBRE report; the average rent per apartment was $2,822.\n",

        "content": "An office building attached to San Francisco\u2019s famed Golden Gate Theatre is on the market.\nThe property at 25 Taylor Street, once home to a WeWork location, is for sale after going into receivership last year, the\nSan Francisco Business Times\nreported. WeWork\u2019s lease once spanned 42,565 square feet of the 50,000-square-foot building, where it remained for nearly a decade.\nThe\nColliers\nlisting doesn\u2019t share a price or owner for the property. The building was valued at $28.1 million in 2014, but a 2023 appraisal placed its value at $9.5 million, according to data from commercial real estate data platform Trepp cited by\nMarketWatch\n.\nWeWork closed its location there in 2021, leaving Baltimore-based landlord War Horse Cities with a nearly totally vacant building in the aftermath of the pandemic. Soon thereafter, in May 2021, War Horse Cities sued WeWork for more than $11 million for breach of lease and breach of guaranty. The lawsuit was dismissed in March 2023, according to the\nBusiness Times\n.\nAn $18.5 million loan tied to the office building went into default in 2021. Private equity investor and JSP Ventures founder Scott Plank secured the funding at the time. The loan was transferred into special servicing in February 2023 with an outstanding balance of $16.9 million. An unnamed receiver was appointed at the end of 2023, according to the Business Times.\n\nThe attached Golden Gate Theatre is owned by ATG Entertainment and is not for sale. The property was built in 1922, with WeWork making extensive upgrades to the site after moving in in 2013. The offices are eligible for federal and state historic rehabilitation tax credits, which offers a combined benefit of up to 40 percent on qualified rehabilitation expenses.\nWeWork\nfiled for bankruptcy in November 2023. The 25 Taylor property was one of seven leases in San Francisco it planned to abandon as part of its bankruptcy proceedings. The others include 430 California Street, 1455 Market Street, 222 Kearny Street, 180 Geary Street and 800 Market Street. All of those locations are no longer operational.\nThe Mid-Market area has struggled post-pandemic as several notable office tenants like X, Spotify, Uber and Reddit fled for other spaces amid low foot traffic and deteriorating neighborhood conditions, according to the Business Times.\nSouth of the city in Silicon Valley, Amazon has partnered with WeWork to house its employees in offices subleased out by the co-working company,\nfilling offices in Santa Clara\nand Mountain View.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

One demands records tied to the Trump Organization case, in which James convinced a judge that Trump inflated property values by billions to secure favorable financing. The verdict and penalty have been appealed.\nJames\u2019 lawyer called the investigation \u201cthe most blatant and desperate example of this administration carrying out the president\u2019s political retribution campaign.\u201d The White House declined to comment on whether or not it is directing the probes against James.\nThe other covers her 2020 suit against the NRA, which ousted then-CEO Wayne LaPierre and curtailed the group\u2019s political influence.\n\nAlongside the subpoenas, Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed Ed Martin \u2014 a Trump ally and former interim U.S. attorney \u2014 as special prosecutor to lead the separate real estate probe. That investigation is examining whether James falsified records for homes she owns in Brooklyn and Virginia, worth under $2 million combined, to obtain better loan terms.\nThe\nallegations\nclosely mirror, albeit on a far smaller scale, the valuation misrepresentation claims she leveled at Trump. FBI director Kash Patel confirmed the existence of the property inquiry earlier this year.\nMartin is also investigating Sen. Adam Schiff\u2019s property dealings, suggesting a coordinated push to use federal legal tools against Trump\u2019s political opponents. Whether the real estate allegations against James have merit or are purely political, they threaten to pull the state\u2019s top law enforcement official into a drawn-out fight over the very valuation practices she\u2019s spent years policing.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "The penthouse at Regalia, a luxury condo tower in Sunny Isles Beach, finally secured a buyer, topping luxury residential sales activity last week across Miami-Dade County.\nBuyers signed nine contracts between Aug. 4 and Aug. 10, according to the latest\nEklund-Gomes\nreport, which tracks listings of homes and condos asking $4 million and up in\nMiami-Dade\nthat are included in the Multiple Listing Service. The properties spent about 111 days on the market, on average.\nThirty-one luxury listings were added to the market, for a total of 1,156 listings.\nThe\nprevious week\n, buyers signed contracts for 12 properties in Miami-Dade, asking a combined $96.2 million.\nThe asking dollar volume for the seven single-family homes and two condos under contract last week totals $109.7 million, according to the report, which is authored by the Douglas Elliman team led by Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes.\nThe single-family homes that entered into contract last week had an average asking price of $10.6 million and spent an average of 126 days on the market. They totaled $73.9 million in asking dollar volume.\n\nAt the top of the pending single-family home sales inked last week is the contract signed for the waterfront home at 100 Golden Beach Drive in\nGolden Beach\n, asking $18.5 million with Alan Eskenazi of Miles Goldstein Real Estate. Property records show Johnny Grobman and Noemi Geller own the 7,755-square-foot, six-bedroom and five-and-a-half-bathroom house. It sits on 0.6 acres overlooking the Intracoastal Waterway. The house was built in 2004 and expanded in 2016.\nGrobman is in federal prison. In 2022, he was sentenced to 220 months, or more than 18 years, for his role in a baby formula fraud scheme. A jury found him and others guilty in 2020 of conspiring to commit wire fraud; wire fraud; money laundering; conspiring to obtain pre-retail medical products worth $5,000 or more by fraud or deception, theft of pre-retail medical products; and smuggling goods from the United States, according to the Department of Justice. He\u2019s on the hook for $142 million in restitution.\nThe condos that secured buyers last week had an average asking price of $17.9 million and spent 60 days on the market, on average. They totaled $35.8 million in asking dollar volume, or an average of $3,308 per square foot.\nPenthouse 43 at\nRegalia\n, at 19575 Collins Avenue in Sunny Isles Beach, led the report. The 10,755-square-foot, six-bedroom and six-and-a-half-bathroom condo is on the market with Danny Hertzberg of the Jills Zeder Group at Coldwell Banker for $19.9 million. The two-story penthouse includes a rooftop pool, 500-bottle wine cellar and its own movie theater. The\ndevelopers\nlost the unit when it was sold via auction for $20.5 million in 2022. At one point, it was on the market for $33.9 million.\nLast week in New York, buyers signed contracts for 22 homes, according to the latest\nOlshan\nreport. Their combined asking price was $283.6 million, and the typical home spent 649 days on the market.\n",

        "content": "The former Torstenson Glass facility near Wrigley Field could soon be redeveloped into a five-story, 92-unit apartment building.\nPrivate equity real estate firm North Park Ventures and Chicago-based developer SNS Realty Group are requesting a zoning change to redevelop the vacant facility with 92 apartments, with 14 of them affordable, and 25 parking spaces, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nNo timeline was provided for zoning approval or the project\u2019s estimated completion date.\nFounded in 1889, Torstenson Glass moved out of the building, at 3233-47 North Sheffield Avenue, to Morton Grove in December, according to the company\u2019s website. CBRE broker Tom Svoboda is marketing the property.\nRental demand and rent growth are rising in Chicago and the suburbs as higher interest rates and construction costs put a damper on development, especially in the popular North Side of Chicago Lakeview area.\n\nOther residential redevelopment proposals are making headway in the area, including\nMavrek Development\u2019s\nfive-story, 46-unit project at 925 West Belmont Avenue that was initially proposed as an 11-story, 210 unit complex before plans were scaled back due to financial complications.\nTwo theater sites on the North Side are slated for residential redevelopment. Local firm Jab Real Estate has plans to convert the former Lakeview home of the Blue Man Group \u2014\nBriar Street Theatre\n, at 749 West Briar Place \u2014 to a mixed-use complex that includes 66 residential units. The same firm is proposing the redevelopment of the former Stage 773 theater, at 1215-1227 West Belmont Avenue to 40 residential units. Those two theater redevelopment projects come as performing arts organizations have continued to struggle to regain audiences since the onset of the pandemic.\nThe slowdown in deliveries has also brought investor interest to Chicago and the midwest. Major sales this year include the 292-unit Cobbler Square building in Old Town, which sold for $87 million, and the 191-unit Elevate Lincoln Park building, which sold for $114 million.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The latest deal for the three-bedroom, three-bathroom unit works out to roughly $6,300 per square foot.\nThe deal marks another profitable flip at the luxury hotel-condo conversion, though it\u2019s a far cry from its priciest sale \u2014 a\n$135 million penthouse\nDoronin bought for himself last summer.\nJust weeks later, the building snagged its\nfirst resale\n, when a 23rd-floor unit closed for $64 million, or more than $10,000 per square foot. Doronin\u2019s OKO Group initially sold the four-bedroom apartment for $51 million, or roughly $8,000 per square foot, earlier that year.\nThe seller of the 16th-floor unit, whose identity is shielded by an anonymous LLC called NYPC Crown, bought it for roughly $3 million less than the asking price listed in the offering plan.\n\nThe buyer\u2019s identity is also hidden by an LLC known as Boldt Castle, named after a castle in upstate Alexandria Bay that was commissioned in the early 20th century by George Boldt, the owner of the famed Waldorf Astoria Hotel. The deed was signed by Marcella Marcal Dos Santos.\nAn attorney for the seller did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe Billionaires\u2019 Row development crossed the sellout finish line in January, when the last of 22 units atop the landmarked Crown Building closed for\n$66 million\n. Sales at the building launched quietly in 2018 with buyers at the building including a Swiss money manager and Hong Kong-based private equity executive Terence Chan.\nDoronin, through a partnership with developer Michael Shvo, purchased the office portion of the building for $475 million in 2015. Shvo was no longer a part of the project by 2017, though he kept a small stake.\n",

Financing will come from the city\u2019s Department of Housing Preservation and Development and a $55 million state award for infrastructure work.\n\u201cThis stretch of the Bronx waterfront has led many lives, but will soon be home to over 900 families,\u201d Adams said in a statement.\nThe announcement comes as the Adams administration touts more than 426,000 homes created, preserved or planned since 2022. The mayor also pushed through the first citywide rezoning in six decades, known as \u201cCity of Yes for Housing Opportunity,\u201d which City Hall said will yield 80,000 new homes over 15 years alongside $5 billion in infrastructure upgrades.\nFordham Landing South is part of a larger neighborhood-building push that includes rezonings around Bronx Metro-North stations, Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn and areas in Midtown South, Jamaica and Long Island City. The administration is also advancing its \u201cCity of Yes for Families\u201d strategy to promote housing near schools, transit, parks and grocery stores, as well as boosting homeownership tools and tenant protections.\n\nDynamic Star co-founder and CEO Gary Segal called the Bronx project \u201cthe long-held dream of transforming this neglected stretch of Bronx waterfront into a vibrant, accessible community\u2026 What was once deserted will soon be a destination \u2014 a place where families can live, work and thrive for generations to come.\u201d\nThe timeline for the project is unclear; at one point, the goal appeared to be to break ground in the first quarter and deliver by 2027.\nThere are also questions about a\nseparate phase\nof the larger Fordham Landing project.\u00a0 Fordham Landing North is expected to include more than 1.8 million square feet of residential space, 744,000 square feet of office space and 143,000 square feet of retail space.\nAt the start of the year, however, a joint venture of Blackstone and Rialto Capital filed a pre-foreclosure action against the developers of the site.\nA representative from Dynamic Star did not immediately respond to a request for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\n",

Willis, property records show. Willis owns El Dorado Hills, California-based American Recovery Services, one of the largest auto repossession firms and debt collectors in the country.\nThe nine-bedroom, 15-bathroom home returned to the market last year for $39 million, which means it sold for 30 percent off the asking price. But Willis fared well \u2014 he paid just $12.5 million\nfor the mansion in 2021\n.

Spadaro of Realty 100 Associates represented the seller, according to Redfin.\n\nDietrich said the estate is \u201cone of the most amenity rich properties in all of\nFort Lauderdale\n.\u201d It has three-phase mega-yacht power, which is comparable to a commercial marina, according to Dietrich. The home also includes a resort-style pool, a wellness wing with a gym, spa and solarium, staff quarters and a seven-car garage.\nAndretti won 42 races before he retired in the early- to mid-2000s and owns Andretti Autosport, an IndyCar-winning team. His son, Marco Andretti, is an IndyCar Series driver.\nA few big-ticket deals have closed recently in Fort Lauderdale, which is often overshadowed by competing markets in Palm Beach and Miami Beach. In April, developer Louis Paolino Jr. sold the house at 2626 Delmar Place in Fort Lauderdale to an LLC managed by Paul D. DeAngelo\nfor $27.8 million\n.\nIn September, financier\nDonald Sussman\nsold his waterfront mansion in Fort Lauderdale for $70 million. The sale holds the price record for home sales in the coastal city. Sussman sold the 20,000-square-foot, 10-bedroom, 15-and-a-half bathroom estate at 5 Harborage Isle to a Delaware LLC named after the 2.7-acre property. It has 1,035 feet of water frontage.\n",

He counted about the same amount of volume in off-market transactions during that same period.\n\u27a4 Compass continues to bolster its offices, with the most recent additions padding its Orange County roster.\nThat includes bringing over Diane Kutinsky and Chrissy Reilly from Seven Gables to the brokerage\u2019s Huntington Beach office.\nThe duo notched more than $49 million in sales volume over the past 12 months and come to Compass with more than 25 years of combined experience.\n\nThey specialize in Huntington Beach\u2019s Seacliff, Seacliff on the Greens and Edward Hill Estates communities, though the two have sold homes from Santa Monica to San Clemente.\n\u27a4 Elsewhere in Orange County, Compass brought the Robinett Team to its Dana Point office.\nDoug, Soosan and Serena Robinett joined Compass after a 25-year run with First Team. The Robinetts have sold $15.6 million in sales volume year to date and focus their business on south OC\u2019s residential market.\n\u27a4 Andy Hairabedien is now with Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California, bringing to the brokerage his specialty in the San Gabriel and San Fernando valleys.\nHairabedien, who comes from a family of developers and previously ran his own brokerage, counts his wife Lillian as part of his team, along with Sophia Kelley and Nareg Khatchadourian.\n\u27a4 In Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\u2019s Beverly Hills office, the brokerage added Mary Hollis.\nHollis works in luxury residential real estate, in addition to new construction. She focuses on Beverly Hills and the greater Los Angeles area.\n\u27a4 Nourmand &amp; Associates nabbed Realtor Nita Bakhda to focus on the Beverly Hills market. Before entering real estate, Bakhda was involved in residential leasing.\nThe brokerage also added agent Sami Housman, who specializes in Hancock Park, Brookside, West Hollywood, Windsor Square, Hollywood Hills, Los Feliz and Mid City.\nHousman, who was previously with Carolwood Estates, has a background in the entertainment industry, where she was a manager and producer.\n",

That could prompt the need for a federal waiver for him to serve on the housing authority or prompt a requirement that he wait one year after leaving office \u2014 known as the \u201crevolving door provision\u201d from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nSenior mayoral adviser Jason Lee said Johnson is determined to appoint Burnett to CEO of the agency.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the regulation applies in this instance. Former Alderman Terry Peterson also moved from city council straight to CHA under former Mayor Richard Daley. It is unclear if and when a federal waiver would be granted.\n\nThe agency has gone more than nine months without a permanent CEO, and the board has dealt with several other top executives leaving the authority in recent months.\nIf Burnett lands the $310,000-a-year job, he has pledged to create replacement housing and jobs, promises he has made to residents of Cabrini-Green, the demolished CHA complex where Burnett grew up.\nHe said as CEO he would prioritize a review of CHA employees and contractors, find a \u201cgood chief of staff,\u201d fill the job of\nchief legal counsel\nand move forward with CHA\u2019s 30-year-old Plan for Transformation.\nCHA has faced significant management problems, including high turnover among executives, with over\n$868,000 in severance payouts\nto departing leaders amid ongoing leadership instability. The agency has struggled with outdated technology leading to\n$10 million in uncollected rent\n. Meanwhile, the agency is embroiled in legal disputes, including a\n$24 million verdict\nrelated to lead poisoning, which has compounded its operational challenges.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

In May, Hines bought another apartment complex in Santana Row, the 108-unit\nLevare\n, for $73.9 million.\nFederal Realty CEO Don Wood shared on the company\u2019s Aug. 6 earnings call that the firm plans to sell the Misora apartments across the street from the Levare.\nHe noted that assets such as the Misora and Levare are essential in broader shopping centers and mixed-use communities such as Santana Row without integrating them into the core retail amenity base.\n\u201cThese are all high-quality assets that we\u2019ve built over the last 25 years that are ripe for monetization without disrupting the productivity or the valuation of the core mixed-use environments we\u2019ve created,\u201d Wood said, per the Business Journal.\n\nMisora was built in 2014 and totals roughly 222,000 square feet, according to Yardi Matrix data cited by the Business Journal. The property boasts\namenities\nlike a lap pool, lounging pool, spa, fireplace lounge, rooftop deck and outdoor barbecue and dining facilities. If Misora sells for a similar price-per-unit as Levare, the overall price tag would be more than $145 million.\nHousing continues to be a priority at Santana Row for Federal Realty. Last month, the owner and developer announced\nplans for a 258-unit apartment complex\nat 358 Hatton Street, currently a surface parking lot for shops, restaurants, offices and homes in Santana Row. It would be the first new housing development at Santana Row in a decade.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on this residential project for a very long time,\u201d Patrick McMahon, Federal Realty\u2019s senior vice president of development, told\nThe Mercury News\n, noting that groundbreaking on the project is imminent.

The ownership entity has an address in the Lubbock suburb Wolfforth.\nSterling Bay planned to build a 13-story office building called The Assembly, a $100 million endeavor designed by Dallas\u2019 HKS.

A vacant office building that was once home to animation studio Reel FX still sits at the location.\nA website for The Assembly shows office space, ground floor retail and amenities including \u201cwellness\u201d initiatives.\n\nThe sale is the latest offloading of real estate by Sterling Bay, which is facing significant challenges following delays on its planned Lincoln Yards megadevelopment in Chicago.\nThe firm listed a 1.56-acre parcel that\u2019s entitled for a 355-unit residential project at 2033 North Kingsbury Street last month, and it has sold several other properties in Chicago. In March, it handed over control of a significant portion of the 53-acres that were slated for Lincoln Yards to lender\nBank OZK via deed-in-lieu of foreclosure\n. The deal, which gave Bank OZK 28 acres, settled Sterling Bay\u2019s $126 million mortgage. The loan\u2019s maturity had been extended several times, and the lender had written it down to $88 million by the end of last year.\nSterling Bay also recently sold a 47-story apartment tower in Chicago\u2019s Loop to\nCedar Street\n.

        "content": "Like any good socialist, Zohran Mamdani is familiar with the Marxist phrase, \u201cFrom each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.\u201d\nMamdani says he was making\n$47,000 a year\nwhen he moved into his rent-stabilized apartment, which he found on StreetEasy. Maybe he needed a low-rent unit then. But now he makes\n$142,000\n, his wife also works, and his parents are wealthy.\nClearly, Mamdani is getting more than he needs. Karl Marx would not approve.\nNow\nalong comes Andrew Cuomo\n, calling on his rival mayoral candidate to give up the $2,300-a-month one-bedroom in Astoria.\nCuomo also pitched \u201c\nmeans testing\n\u201d to screen out high-earning tenants from rent-stabilized housing: To initially lease a unit, a tenant\u2019s monthly income could not be more than 3.33 times the monthly rent. That is, the rent would have to be at least 30 percent of the tenant\u2019s income.\nThat might sound appealing to critics of rent regulation and even to progressives. Why should more than 1 in 5 rent-stabilized units go to households making six figures?\nHowever, allowing only low-income people to lease these apartments is a bad idea, although not for the reasons that most people think.\nRent stabilization is a fundamentally flawed housing system. It is literally designed to\nperpetuate the housing emergency\n.\nTo give it a veneer of legitimacy by means testing is like painting over mold. It might look better initially, but doesn\u2019t fix the problem. Indeed, mold only gets worse under new paint.\n\u201cThe problem with rent control is that it addresses a problem rooted in regulations with more regulations,\u201d wrote\nMichael Hendrix\nof the Manhattan Institute. \u201cRent regulations \u2018solve\u2019 America\u2019s affordability crisis for a few people, for a short time, at great cost to everyone else.\u201d\nThe fact that many well-off New Yorkers enjoy artificially low rents \u2014 some while keeping beach houses or country homes \u2014 is a potent argument to junk the whole system.\nBut there are better reasons to end it altogether. Rent regulation merely creates winners and losers, reducing vacancy at 1 million apartments to nearly zero. It promotes the deterioration of housing, makes tenants enemies rather than customers of landlords, hinders new construction and stands in the way of a fair and functional housing market.\n\nIf that sounds too philosophical, consider the practical arguments against means testing.\nOwners of rent-stabilized housing are under the government\u2019s thumb in so many ways. Means-testing deprives them of the right to rent to a tenant of their choice, and adds yet another layer of bureaucracy. The last thing owners need is another hoop to jump through.\nAlso, it\u2019s usually easier to operate a mixed-income building than one where everyone is barely getting by.\nNew York actually had a crude form of means testing until June 15, 2019: A landlord could evict tenants from rent-stabilized units by proving that they made more than $225,000 two years in a row.\nThat was difficult and it rarely happened. Then the 2019 rent reform removed the incentives to vacate a unit. So even if means testing were restored, most landlords would gain nothing by enforcing an income limit.\nAn asset limit would be even harder to police, as assets are private and easily hidden.\nIn theory, the state could monitor tenants\u2019 income by looking at their tax returns. If the Division of Homes and Community Renewal provided the tax department with a complete list of rent-stabilized units, the tax office could flag tenants who exceeded an income threshold.\nBut then what? Who would evict these tenants? Landlords are not going to endure a two-year slog through housing court and pay thousands in legal fees to replace rich tenants with poor ones who pay exactly the same rent.\nTraditional affordable housing programs only screen incomes before the initial lease-signing. They don\u2019t kick out tenants who get a raise or a better job. That would be highly disruptive, and a disincentive for people to advance their careers.\nIf Mamdani left his apartment, it would not guarantee his landlord would rent it to a needier tenant. And forcing unsubsidized landlords to do that is unworkable and possibly unconstitutional.\nI don\u2019t blame Cuomo for raising this subject, even though he was dishonest to say that Mamdani\u2019s rental forces a mother and her children to live in a shelter. He is trying to win an election, and his attack has brought attention to a dysfunctional system. Besides, all is fair in love and politics.\nBut means testing would be a bureaucratic nightmare, and would give a patina of acceptability to an unacceptable system. Perhaps that\u2019s why Cuomo never proposed it during his 11 years as governor.\n",

        "content": "Andrew Cuomo thinks rent-stabilized apartments should be reserved for tenants who spend at least a third of their income on rent.\nOn Monday, Cuomo released details on \u201cZohran\u2019s Law,\u201d a proposal inspired by the fact that Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani lives in a rent-stabilized apartment.\nHere\u2019s the gist: Once a rent stabilized apartment becomes vacant, a landlord could only rent to someone who would spend at least 30 percent of their income on rent.\nMamdani pays $2,300 a month, and makes $142,000 as a state Assembly member (meaning he spends well below that 30 percent threshold). In a press release, Cuomo said the law is needed to ensure stabilized apartments are going to New Yorkers in need and to \u201cstop the Zohran Mamdanis of the world from gaming the system and boxing out lower income New Yorkers.\u201d Cuomo\u2019s law wouldn\u2019t kick Mamdani out of his apartment, though. He\u2019d have to leave of his own accord before those rules would kick in.\nBefore I get into the particulars of the proposal, it is important to note that the mayor does not have the authority to make this kind of change, and a law limiting access to rent-stabilized apartments would be a hard sell to state lawmakers.\nCuomo framed the proposal as a complement to the elimination of high-income decontrol in 2019. That was another form of rooting out tenants from stabilized housing if they made too much.\nPrior to June 2019, one of the ways that stabilized units could be deregulated was if the rent exceeded a certain threshold and the existing tenant\u2019s gross income was $200,000 or more for two consecutive years. Cuomo\u2019s proposal \u201cbuilds on the important 2019 reform\u2026 by keeping these units in the system while making sure they are reserved for households that actually need affordable housing.\u201d\nI asked his spokesperson why this latest form of means testing wasn\u2019t paired with that change in 2019, when Cuomo was governor and had more sway over state law, but I didn\u2019t hear back.\nHigh-income decontrol was used less frequently by landlords than the other avenues.\nA 2020 Rent Guidelines Board report\nfound that 160 stabilized units had been deregulated in 2019 (before the rent law passed) through high-income decontrol. Nearly 8,000 were deregulated through another practice eliminated in 2019, high-rent vacancy decontrol, during that same period.\nAs with high-income decontrol, Cuomo\u2019s new version of means testing would be enforced by the state\u2019s already overextended housing regulator. There\u2019s also a question of whether adding these new rules will further slow down how quickly tenants can move in (the city recently\nmade changes\nto its housing lottery to cut back on the bureaucratic hurdles delaying tenant access to affordable apartments).\nIf the goal of \u201cZohran\u2019s Law\u201d is to reshape the rent-stabilization system into an affordable housing program where housing is set aside for New Yorkers earning a certain amount, it is treading in the opposite direction of the city\u2019s other housing programs.\nUnder the city\u2019s Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program, for instance, rents are considered \u201caffordable\u201d because they are generally set so that tenants do not pay more than 30 percent of their income on rent. That\u2019s not always the case, and there is, of course, a whole debate around what is truly affordable housing, but that is a guiding principle for what is considered affordable.\n\nSomeone who pays more than 30 percent of their income on rent is considered rent-burdened, and requiring tenants to either be on the verge of that or beyond it in order to access stabilized housing arguably diminishes whatever \u201cstabilizing\u201d quality the housing provides.\nTenants\u2019 groups unsurprisingly criticized Cuomo\u2019s proposal. TenantBloc\u2019s Cea Weaver called means testing rent stabilization \u201ca backdoor plan to gut it, ensuring that the people who keep our city running \u2013 teachers, grocery clerks, delivery workers, nurses \u2013 get pushed out.\u201d Landlord groups also weren\u2019t too hot on the idea either. Leaders of the New York Apartment Association posted on social media that the proposal doesn\u2019t address what they see as the main issue: That rents are kept well below the costs of operating these properties.\n\u201cNY city and state government has used rent stabilized housing as its affordable housing program for decades,\u201d NYAA\u2019s Jay Martin posted on X. \u201cIt\u2019s sucked it dry pretending to care about the quality of the housing for renters by attacking the owners for not conjuring revenue out of thin air.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: What actions, within the mayor\u2019s actual power, would you like to see the next mayor take in connection with rent-stabilized housing? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The building that houses the Morrin Centre, an English-language library in Quebec City, was constructed in the early 1800s as one of the city\u2019s first prisons,\naccording to the centre\u2019s website\n.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 NYCHA will provide rental assistance to the nearly 5,500 low-income households who are set to lose aid after the federal government decided not to renew the Emergency Housing Voucher program, which is set to run out of funds five years ahead of schedule, according to\nGothamist\n. In order to fund this assistance, the housing agency will stop issuing new Section 8 vouchers to the thousands on the waiting list.\n\u2014 The Adams administration will close New York City\u2019s last hotel dedicated to housing homeless migrants, the Row NYC,\nGothamist\nreports. The hotel complex was the first of many to be converted during 2022\u2019s surge of asylum seekers. It joins the list of 64 other migrant shelters that have been shut down since last June.\n\u2014\u00a0Zohran Mamdani launched a \u201cFive Boroughs Against Trump\u201d tour on Monday, framing himself as the strongest opponent to the president while attacking rival Andrew Cuomo over alleged ties to Trump,\namNY\nreports. Touting endorsements by Ruth Messinger, Keith Powers and Harvey Epstein, it\u2019s the latest development in Mamdani\u2019s attempt to center the race around opposition to Trump and his agenda. \u2014\nQuinn Waller\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was for a condominium unit for\n$28 million\nat 730 Fifth Avenue. The Midtown condo is 4,500 square feet and last sold in 2023 as a new-construction unit for $24.3 million.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$54.5 million\nfor a commercial unit at 85 Jay Street. The rental Dumbo units are a part of the 728-unit, 21-story Front &amp; York condo.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was for a penthouse at 255 East 77th Street for $24 million. The Upper East Side condo is 5,500 square feet and listed by\nCompass\u2019\nAlexa Lambert, Alison Black and Shelton Smith.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for a proposed 26,232-square-foot, six-story, mixed-use building at 6420 Bay Parkway in Brooklyn.

The 4-million-square-foot project could eventually include up to 1,900 apartments and condos, 39,000 square feet of retail, office space, a 17-slip marina and 770 parking spaces. Madison Realty Capital provided the developer with a\n$310 million construction loan\nin 2021.\nThe first phase is almost done. Chetrit is nearing completion on the 54-story, 632-unit luxury apartment tower on the site at 275 Southwest Sixth Street. At least two additional towers are planned on the remaining land. In 2022, Chetrit\nrevealed plans\ntapping David Grutman\u2019s Groot Hospitality to handle the food and beverage programming in the first tower.\nFlow will manage the apartment tower and lead development of the rest of the project as managing member of the majority ownership, according to a press release.\nThe final version of the deal is based on a $525 million market capitalization of the project, which is now called Flow on the Miami River, according to the release.\nNeumann, who co-founded WeWork, has been expanding his Flow empire in South Florida and abroad \u2014 including in\nSaudi Arabia\n.\n\nFlow is developing a three-tower apartment, office and retail project in Aventura; an apartment and commercial complex in El Portal; a 466-unit\nFlow-branded condo tower\nat Miami Worldcenter; and the completed Flow Miami and Flow Fort Lauderdale apartment buildings.\nFlow is partnering with Canada Global on more than 9 million square feet of mixed-use projects, including about 5,000 apartments, according to the release. Flow purchased 30 percent of Canada Global, an Israeli real estate investment company led by Assaf Tuchmair and Barak Rosen, for about $27 million, according to\nCalcalist\n.\nThe Chetrit family has had the Miami River project in the works for\nmore than a decade\n. The Miami City Commission\napproved\na major site rezoning and the project\u2019s development agreement in 2015.\nLate last year, Chetrit\npartnered\nwith Montreal-based Lotus International on Chetrit\u2019s long-awaited Miami Beach hotel project, the redevelopment of the Collins Park Hotel at 2000 Park Avenue. Chetrit also secured an $88 million refinancing for the loan backing the property.\nThe Chetrit family\u2019s empire includes the Chetrit Group and the Chetrit Organization, both of which have been tied up in litigation as of late. In New York, Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 administration is alleging the Chetrit Group, led by Meyer and Joseph Chetrit, allowed a Times Square property once dubbed the city\u2019s \u201cdirtiest\u201d hotel to deteriorate after defaulting on a $233 million loan.\n",

        "content": "Another amenity-rich development has entered the Houston multifamily pipeline.\nDefine Living, a fitness-focused multifamily developer based in Houston, bought a 10.4-acre parcel from Wolff Companies last week with plans for a 388-unit project called Define Living: Park Row.\nThe four-story apartment complex will have one- and two-bedroom units, with amenities including a gym, infrared sauna, cold plunge, bicycle spa and \u201ca personal wellbeing coach for every resident.\u201d Developer Henry Richardson said he chose the site for its proximity to Terry Hershey Park and access to the Bayou Greenways, a city project that\u2019s expected to link Houston\u2019s major parks with trails.\nConstruction on the apartments will begin this year. Richardson\u2019s construction company, Blazer Building, expects to finish the apartment clubhouse by the end of next year, with the residential buildings coming later.\nRichardson, a yoga studio owner and former athlete, has developed about two dozen properties in Houston; however, this is only the second Define Living concept. The first opened at 1888 Brittmoore last year, and all 260 units were leased in 10 months, Richardson said.\n\nThis development has 4.4 acres more than the first, so it will give the company \u201cthe ability to build a little more expensive with our amenities,\u201d Richardson said.\nCarolyn Wolff Dorros of Wolff Companies, said Richardson snapped up the penultimate parcel available for development in the Energy Corridor, a business district in West Houston home to several major energy companies. The last undeveloped parcel is a 15.2-acre tract south of Richardson\u2019s purchase. So far, it\u2019s attracted the attention of entertainment and hospitality concepts, Dorros said.\nCheaper land in the exurbs is driving many multifamily developers outward, Dorros said.\n\u201cSome of the multifamily market has almost leapfrogged us,\u201d Dorros said. \u201cApartment developers are getting quite aggressive in terms of going further out, especially if there\u2019s good school districts.\u201d\nRelatively slower multifamily construction has helped the Houston market avoid rent declines that hit other Texas metros last year, especially Austin. However,\nHouston apartments below Class A have been losing occupants\nfor the past year.\n",

        "content": "San Antonio is one of the fastest-growing large cities in the nation, with rapid single-family and commercial development, but government entities and ranches are the largest landowners in the region, the San Antonio Express-News\nreported\n.\nSan Antonio, known as Military City USA, has Air Force and Army installations that now comprise Joint Base San Antonio (Randolph Air Force Base, Fort Sam Houston, Lackland Air Force Base and Camp Bullis). Other federal holdings such as those owned by the U.S. Postal Service, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of the Interior, National Park Service, and the Army Corps of Engineers make the federal government the largest landowner in the San Antonio metropolitan area, which includes Atascosa, Bandera, Bexar, Comal, Guadalupe, Kendall, Medina and Wilson counties.\nThe State of Texas is next in terms of property ownership in the region, and it\u2019s easy to see why, when considering the number of state parks and natural areas dotting the region. The Texas General Land Office holdings include the Alamo (four other historic San Antonio missions fall under the National Park Service). Other landowning state agencies in the region include the Department of Criminal Justice, Department of Transportation, Texas Historical Commission, Permanent School Fund, Veterans Land Board and National Guard Armory Board, plus state healthcare facilities such as the San Antonio State Hospital.\nThe city of San Antonio is the next largest landowner, with dozens of city parks, golf courses, nature trails, bicycle paths and city infrastructure facilities and government buildings. San Antonio International Airport and Stinson-Mission Municipal Airport are owned by the city, as are the Alamodome and Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center.\n\nOther top landowners include ranchland and other large swaths of rural Texas that have been held by families for generations. The George Robinson-owned 74Ranch is a 27,000-acre area managed for hunting game animals. The Peeler family\u2019s Peeler Ranch comprises 21,000 acres of cattle ranching for wagyu and akaushi breeds. The E.L. Ranch, owned by Steven and Lee Stockseth, spans more than 10,900 acres and operates as a cattle operation and also offers whitetail deer hunting. The next five-biggest land owners in the region hold 8,000 to 10,000 acres each.\nWhile many of these ranches have been intact over many decades, prices and competition for land in the region have spiked since the pandemic as people left cities while investors sought to park capital in large properties in partnership with farmers and ranchers.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The developer also needs a zoning change to build between two and five stories.\nAmerican Ventures is also negotiating an economic development agreement with the city for tax abatements, but the details haven\u2019t been disclosed.\nThe buildout would take place across three phases, wrapping up in 2031. Documents estimate the project could eventually generate $66.1 million in sales and property taxes for Hays County and $145 million in property, sales and hotel taxes for the city.\n\nThe location for the project would be yet another development filling in land within the rapidly growing Austin-San Antonio corridor. A tourist destination for river recreation, San Marcos is home to Texas State University and is located about 30 miles south of Austin and about 50 miles north of Downtown San Antonio. Industrial builders, data centers, entertainment districts and major Amazon warehouses have found homes in San Marcos in recent years.\nAmerican Ventures\u2019 previous developments include The Draper, at 217 Garland Avenue in the Dallas suburb Garland. That 155-unit project was funded with a 2.96 percent interest rate HUD loan with a term of 40 years, according to the firm\u2019s website.\nIt also gained local approval a year ago for a\n350,000-square-foot retail center\non 60 acres in the Austin suburb Elgin.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The deal for 477,101 square feet of offices works out to about $252 per square foot. CBRE Investment Management acquired the property in 2016 for $256 million, or about $537 per square foot, per CO.\nPasadena Towers consists of two Class A office buildings at 55 South Lake Avenue and 800 East Colorado Boulevard linked by a courtyard. The property features tenant amenities including a 3,000-square-foot fitness center, a 2,000-square foot conference room and a seven-level parking garage. Asking rent is about $4.35 per square foot per month, according to\nCBRE\n.\nThe deal marks the largest-ever investment by Seal Beach-based Harbor Associates and is one of the largest office investments by square footage in Greater Los Angeles so far this year, according to CO. In the first half of the year, the L.A. metro area closed $1.4 billion in office sales; in the same period last year, L.A. registered just $287 million in office sales.\n\nAlso valued at far less, last month, the nine-story Pasadena Office Tower at 150 South Robles Avenue was reappraised at $23 million, marking a 59 percent decrease from its appraisal on the property a decade ago,\nThe Real Deal\npreviously reported.\nOccupancy at the Pasadena Office Tower dropped from 93 percent in 2015 to 69 percent last year. The five largest leases, making up nearly 40 percent of the building, are set to expire at the end of 2027, including arrangements with the City of Pasadena and the California Department of Rehabilitation.\nOffice vacancy across Greater Los Angeles ticked up marginally to 24.4 percent last quarter, up from 24.1 percent in the\nsame period\nlast year, according to\nColliers\n.

Hilton Union Square is the city\u2019s largest hotel with 1,921 rooms, while the Parc 55, a Hilton property, is among the top five with 1,024 rooms, according to the\nSan Francisco Business Times\n.\nHilton Union Square at 333 O\u2019Farrell Street and Parc 55 at 55 Cyril Magnin Street, both in the Union Square neighborhood, were previously owned by Park Hotels &amp; Resorts, an affiliate of Hilton Worldwide Holdings. Park\ndefaulted on its $725 million mortgage\non the properties in 2023.\nA previous court order set a deadline of July 29 for the sale but no deal materialized. On Aug. 6, a judge approved a request to extend a court-appointed receiver\u2019s ability to sell the properties until Oct. 29, marking the fourth time the sale deadline has been extended.\nThe receiver, Michelle Russo of Hotel Asset Value Enhancement, has been looking to sell the two properties for nearly two years on behalf of Wilmington Trust, a trustee for special servicer Wells Fargo. An attorney for Russo declined to comment on the identity of the buyer to the Chronicle but said a motion to approve the sale will be filed \u201csoon.\u201d\n\nSeveral\nhotels across the Bay Area\nhave suffered financial setbacks in the years since the pandemic\u2019s outbreak. Many properties in the East Bay and South Bay, as well as San Francisco itself, have fallen into loan defaults and foreclosure proceedings over the past year.\nHotel sales\nin general in California declined 7.4 percent in the first half of the year from the same period the year prior, according to Atlas Hospitality Group. In the Bay Area, the largest hotel sales in Alameda County and Santa Clara County in the first six months of the year were foreclosure sales.\nLast month, the 500-room\nOakland Marriott City Center\n, a 500-room hotel was taken back by lender Invesco in a foreclosure proceeding that valued the building at $70.2 million.

The 660,000-square-foot development would include 70,000 square feet of commercial space \u2014 including two basement retail spaces \u2014 and 114,000 square feet for a community facility on the first floor.\nThere would also be 297 parking spaces in the cellar and another 235 on the first floor. Residential amenities include a pool on the second floor.\nXu did not respond to the outlet\u2019s request for comment.\n\nUnited bought the site from Steve Roth\u2019s Vornado Realty Trust in 2023 for $71.1 million, a 16 percent discount on the $85 million the real estate investment trust initially sought for the property. Shortly after the acquisition, the developer\nreleased renderings\nfor a three-building mixed-use complex at the site, planning for 706 units at the time.\nXu\u2019s firm is best known for developing the 67-story, 802-unit\nSkyline Tower in Long Island City\n, the tallest completed building in the borough (set to be surpassed by BLDG Management\u2019s The Orchard in the coming years). More than 90 percent of the units at the property, completed in 2022, have sold.\nUnited began offering complimentary Porsches to prospective buyers to move the building\u2019s unsold penthouse units.\nOther prominent projects for Corona-based United include The Cube at 24-01 43rd Avenue in Long Island City and Whitestone Manor at 137-08 31st Road in Flushing.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The listing comes with a $40 million price tag, or $1,176 per square foot.\nThe condo occupies the base of Park Avenue Place, a 45-story, 76-unit condo tower Rosen co-developed in 2006 with Davis, designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox. Between Park and Madison avenues, the space still bears the high-end buildout that made the Core Club a see-and-be-seen address for financiers, designers and power brokers when it opened in 2005.\nDesigned by Stonely Pelsinski Architects Neukomm, the interiors boast a screening room, restaurant, full commercial kitchen, library, spa, fitness center, outdoor terrace, and a network of lounges and meeting rooms, all of which appear to be included in the sale. Annual common charges run $158,000 and property taxes are around $862,000 this year.\nThe Plaza District asset could be a turnkey option for another private club or hospitality operator, a segment starved for premium space in Midtown.\n\u201cTrophy deals of this caliber will transact,\u201d broker Brandon Charnas told CO, noting the scarcity of large-scale food and beverage venues in the area; Charnas is not involved in the property\u2019s marketing.\n\nRudder Property Group\u2019s Michael Rudder and Justin Harris are teaming with BKREA\u2019s Bob Knakal, Ryan Candel and Tom Brady on the listing.\nRosen seeded Core Club\u2019s launch, and early members included Stephen Schwarzman, Kenneth Cole, Sir Norman Foster and Roger Waters. But the pandemic upended operations: in 2021 the club and Sweetgreen, a tenant in another condo in the building, stopped paying rent, leading to a\nforeclosure action\non a $25 million mortgage.\nRFR ultimately refinanced with Signature Bank and settled the case in early 2022. Core Club relocated to 711 Fifth Avenue, reopening in 2023 before promptly sparring in court with landlord Michael Shvo.\nLast week, a judge ruled that the owners of Core Club\nowe Shvo nearly $1 million\n, a decision the club vowed to appeal.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Siblings Sean and Nicole Mirmelli suffered a significant setback in their legal battle to kill a 99-year ground lease tied to one of two parcels underneath the Kimpton Surfcomber Hotel in Miami Beach.\nLast week, Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Thomas Rebull dismissed four of the five counts in the Mirmellis\u2019 May lawsuit against hotel owner Chisholm Properties South Beach, led by\nRobert Balzebre\n. The dismissed counts included breach of contract, commercial eviction and slander of title.\nRebull essentially denied the\nMirmellis\n\u2019 request to cancel the ground lease, as well as appoint a receiver to take over management of the parcel at 1731 Collins Avenue that makes up half of the Surfcomber assemblage. Chisholm and the Mirmellis, through a trust, each own 50 percent of the 1731 Collins Avenue land.\nWhen Chisholm bought the three-story hotel for $1.4 million in 2004, the firm separately assumed the ground lease at 1731 Collins Avenue that allowed for construction of the 186-key\nArt Deco\nbuilding completed in 1948, records show. The deal also included the second parcel at 1717 Collins Avenue, which Chisholm owns outright.\nIn an emailed statement, Mirmelli attorney Joseph Pardo said his clients will seek a rehearing \u201cand will appeal if necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe there was an ongoing breach because the lease restrictions are covenants that run with the land,\u201d Pardo said.\nAbbey Kaplan, a lawyer representing Chisholm, said the Mirmellis\u2019 lawsuit was \u201ca frivolous and misguided attempt to unwind a long-standing lease.\u201d\nIn their lawsuit, the Mirmellis alleged that Chisholm breached the ground lease by altering the building\u2019s condition that did not conform to the 99-year agreement. Chisholm also was allegedly hit with liens on the property and obtained an unauthorized $20.5 million loan in 2014 that was secured by the building and the two parcels.\nThe Mirmellis, whose cousin\nAndrew Mirmelli\nis a prolific Miami Beach real estate investor, accused Chisholm of including an estoppel letter with a purported forgery of Nicole Mirmelli\u2019s signature with the mortgage documents. In an affidavit, she denied signing the letter, which verified the current status of the ground lease.\nChisholm\u2019s lawyer disputed the allegation. \u201cOur client received the fully executed Estoppel Certificate directly from the Mirmellis,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cAnd a notary testified under oath that he personally witnessed the signing. Any alleged misdeed was attributable to the Mirmellis.\u201d\nRebull ruled that the Mirmellis\u2019 claims about the liens and the 2014 mortgage were barred by a statute of limitations. The judge also determined that the Mirmellis lacked standing to enforce the ground lease without Chisholm\u2019s consent.",

On top of that, the estimated 500,000 square feet of new retail space expected to come online in the Chicago area will mostly be suburban developments, making Chicago-proper retail vacancies scarcer.\nNewCity can expect no shortage of customers to its tenant businesses, as two apartment high rises are\nplanned\nin the area, including a\n500-unit apartment tower\nat Clybourn Place and a 400-unit tower at 1565 N.

And the fifth is subject to an older 421a agreement under which an owner could raise rents by 47 percent before hitting their legal rent limits.\n\u201cWith no exposure to income-restriction and minimal impact from Rent Guidelines Board limitations, the portfolio benefits from robust, market-driven rent growth across all assets,\u201d read an offering memo from Newmark, where a team led by Adam Spies and Marcella Fasulo is overseeing the sales process.\nThe offering comes as investors anxiously eye New York\u2019s mayoral election in November. Assembly member Mamdani won a decisive victory in the Democratic party primary in June, in part by promising to freeze rents on the city\u2019s roughly 1 million rent-stabilized apartments. This comes amid increased rent-stabilized distress, with that housing stock seeing foreclosures and delinquencies rise precipitously, most of which is attributed to the 2019 law that essentially blocked substantial rent increases.\n\nRepresentatives for UDR, MetLife and Newmark did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The REIT, led by CEO Tom Toomey, is eyeing a price of $450-500 million for the 710-unit portfolio \u2014 either through an outright sale or a recapitalization.\nThe buildings are 775, 795, 805 and 808 Columbus Avenue, as well as 801 Amsterdam Avenue.\nUDR teamed up with MetLife in 2012 to buy the portfolio from Laurence Gluck\u2019s Stellar Management and the Chetrit Group for\n$635 million\n.\nIt\u2019s not clear why the portfolio\u2019s value has declined, but this wouldn\u2019t be UDR\u2019s first loss in recent memory. In January, the company sold an apartment building at 395 Leonard Street in Brooklyn for $127.5 million, a slight discount to the $130.4 million the company had paid six years earlier.\n\u201cThe approximately 5 percent decline in value for Leonard Pointe in the six years UDR owned the property compares to a 15-20 percent decline for Green Street\u2019s New York Metro commercial property price index, suggesting Brooklyn property values have held up better than other sub-markets in NYC,\u201d the REIT said in an announcement at the time.\n",

Pritzker also expressed an openness to a separate state program that allows companies to reap the benefits of expanded state sales tax revenue that a project generates.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to evaluate what the costs are for the people of Illinois to do this, the benefits that come from attracting businesses as a result of providing that ability to use those tax dollars,\u201d he said.\nThe comments came ahead of the legislature\u2019s fall veto session.

        "content": "An East Austin hotel that has been closed for 50 years is set for redevelopment by the business partners behind the restaurants Paperboy and Loudmouth Pizza.\nRobert Brown and Ryan Harms of Daybreak Hospitality bought the site of the former Deluxe Hotel, established in the 1940s and shuttered in 1975, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n. They bought the hotel at 1101 Navasota Street and the adjacent lot at 1105 Navasota Street from Jo Baylor. The location is near their restaurants.\nThe buyers envision a hotel with some condominium units. The old hotel will be torn down to make way for a five-story structure. Daybreak Hospitality is still seeking capital and development partners for the project.\nQuestions remain about the timeline and further details of the project, including the number of hotel keys and condos. An architecture firm offices in the location, and it would be at least two years before the building could be demolished.\n\nClayton Korte is working on the conceptual planning and branding of the development. Kempt Studio, the firm that designed Daybreak Hospitality\u2019s restaurants, will also design the hotel. The buyers tapped Lucky Find Hospitality to guide the hotel operations, and it is working with Civilitude to secure engineering and other permits.\nThe seller said it was important to her that the legacy of the hotel be carried into its next iteration. Located in historically Black\nEast Austin\n, the hotel served many touring musicians, such as the Bobby Blue Bland, B.B. King, Etta James, Hank Ballard &amp; the Midnighters, the Five Royales, Little Willie Jones and Big Mama Thornton, according to city documents.\nBrown and Harms have seen prior success in their\nEast Austin\nlocations. Paperboy began as a food truck in the area, and as a brick and mortar sees lines out the door at the consistently busy brunch spot. They opened a\nsecond location\nof Paperboy on South Lamar Boulevard this year.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "In recent weeks, it appeared the cards were firmly stacked against Bally\u2019s and its pursuit of a casino in the Bronx. But Mayor Eric Adams had an ace up his sleeve and the City Council is prepared to watch how the rest of the game unfolds.\nThe casino plan at Ferry Point Park in Throggs Neck received a second shot at success after the City Council didn\u2019t attempt to override the mayor\u2019s\ncritical veto\nof the body\u2019s previous rejection of the pitch, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. A 10-day clock for the council to act lapsed without action on Monday.\nThe surprise move comes after the council\u2019s initial 29-9 vote\nagainst the Bally\u2019s proposal\n, most of the legislative body in lockstep with local councilmember Kristy Marmorato.\nThat July 14 vote centered on a zoning approval Bally\u2019s needed to for its $4 billion proposal, since an applicable portion of the site is on city-owned land. The zoning changes include demapping the site as city parkland and granting a designation to allow a mixed-use development.\nBut in a video interview Wednesday with\nThe Real Deal\u2019s\nPublisher Amir Korangy on July 30, Adams confirmed that he would veto the City Council\u2019s vote. The City Council needed a two-thirds vote to override the mayor\u2019s veto, a bar higher than the initial vote.\n\nBally\u2019s has not commented on the latest development, but Marmarato in a statement last week expressed deep disappointment and promised to keep \u201cfighting this proposal at every stage.\u201d\nThis is only the fifth time since 1989 that the mayor has vetoed council rejections of land-use applications. Of the four previous instances, only once \u2014 in 1992 \u2014 did the council fail to override the veto.\nZoning changes need to be approved before the end of next month, the deadline for a six-member Community Advisory Committee to vote on the proposal. That vote will determine which casino proposals head to the state Gaming Facility Location Board, which ultimately decides the applications to receive the three downstate casino licenses up for grabs from the state.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to expend public capital, time and energy on a thing where the council won\u2019t have the final say,\u201d a council official told the outlet.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The neighborhood is known for its Mid-Century Modern designs carved into the Santa Monica Mountains above Sunset Boulevard.\nDavid Parnes and James Harris, who helm Carolwood Estate\u2019s Bond Street Partners team, hold the listing.\nBraunstein originally placed the property on the market last September for $25.9 million, after purchasing it for $3.4 million in 2017 and then building anew, according to property records.\nIf the closing price is anything above $5.3 million, the deal triggers the Measure United to House Los Angeles (ULA) tax. The tiered assessment levies a 4 percent tax on all real estate transactions starting at $5.3 million and 5.5 percent for those $10.6 million or more. The fee, which is billed as a mansion tax, applies only to deals within the city of Los Angeles.\n\nThe Tigertail Road property sits on a little over an acre with the home spanning more than 14,000 square feet. It has six beds and 10 baths with views of the Getty Center running the length of the 200-foot-long lot.\nOther highlights include a herringbone-design motor court, living room anchored with a stone fireplace and olive tree, primary suite with its own wraparound terrace, wellness center, elevator and infinity pool.\nSitting in the No. 2 spot among last week\u2019s signed contracts is 708 North Rexford Drive in Beverly Hills, which is listed for $16.9 million.\nCarolwood\u2019s Brett Lawyer holds the listing.\nProperty records show the seller is Fox Television Stations CEO Jack Abernethy and his wife Rosemary Abernethy, who bought the home in 2019 for $10.4 million.\nThe couple placed the six-bed, 10-bath home on the market in March for $19.9 million.\nIt\u2019s nearly 7,000 square feet in the Beverly Hills\nFlats neighborhood\nwith a separate wing for staff, pool, guest house, gardens and privacy hedges out front.\nAcross Los Angeles County, 27 homes went into contract last week, which was good for $191.2 million in asking dollar volume, according to the Eklund Gomes report.

The buyer, so far not publicly identified, has been working on the deals with Los Angeles-based real estate firm Weston James Group.\nThe investor honed in on La Costa beachfront lots with 40-foot frontages at minimum for future development. Architects are already working on drawing up plans, according to\nThe New York Post\n. The lots weren\u2019t publicly listed for sale, and those who sold reportedly weren\u2019t interested in rebuilding homes, seawalls and onsite wastewater treatment systems, leading them to get rid of the properties off the market.\nThe unnamed buyer is purportedly willing to deal with the issues of\nrebuilding\nin hopes that new construction will attract wealthy buyers.\n\u201cHe started building a team on his end of expediters, architects and kind of figured out what the best size lots and frontage would be to build on to eventually resell,\u201d Weston Littlefield of Weston James Group told\nRealtor.com\n. \u201cI\u2019d say probably about 50 percent had sentimental value to their properties just based on memories, or their parents passed it down to them. But a lot of them, ultimately, just didn\u2019t want to go through the rebuilding process because of how long they knew it was going to take to really come back.\u201d\n\nOf nearly 350 homeowners in the Palisades and Eaton fire zones, nearly 80 percent in the Palisades burn zone, including Malibu,\nplanned to rebuild\ntheir homes, but 70 percent in the area said they may not return if rebuilding took three years or longer, according to a May\nsurvey\nby Project Recovery. In the Palisades burn zone, residents\u2019 biggest concern was the \u201clack of leadership\u201d from city and county officials to complete recovery and rebuilding.\nMeanwhile, in Altadena, anonymous buyers \u2014 likely including some developers \u2014 are similarly\nsnapping up burned lots\n, with many purchases being made through trusts and limited liability companies.\nIn the seven months since the blazes ripped through the Pacific Palisades and environs, Los Angeles County has issued 16 rebuilding permits in the area, according to the county\u2019s\npermitting progress dashboard\n.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The broker on the bankrupt, half-built Oceanside Plaza in the middle of Downtown Los Angeles says the property has drawn two viable bidders in coming months,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nThat\u2019s down from a list of 17 interested parties last year, when a\nmanaged bid process commenced\nto sell Oceanwide Holdings\u2019 1101 South Flower Street project, according to Colliers\u2019 Mark Tarczynski, whose team is marketing the property along with Hilco Real Estate.\nTHe list narrowed as most of the would-be buyers \u201cat the end of the day they couldn\u2019t scare up the money,\u201d Tarczynski said. \u201cSo now we\u2019re like, \u2018Hey, you want to talk, show us the money!\u2019\u201d\nThe price of admission includes $450 million to acquire the fully entitled site \u2014 which already has $1.2 billion spent on construction \u2014 and roughly $1 billion to complete it.\n\u201cWe get a lot of interest, and it\u2019s just finding a billion and a half dollars to complete the project is proving difficult,\u201d the broker added.\nNow however there are two serious \u201ccompeting bidders,\u201d he said. They are both real estate development companies, one from the U.S. and one from abroad, Tarczynski said, declining to provide any more details.\nThe broker said he anticipates closing the deal by the end of the year, though he\npreviously said\nhe was \u201choping it will happen before the close of Q2.\u201d\n\nConstruction on the 1.5-million-square-foot, graffiti-ridden project, which spans nearly a full city block across from the Los Angeles Convention Center and the Crypto.com arena, began in 2015 and progressed to two half-built towers in fits and starts before landing in bankruptcy due to financial issues, and claims of\nunpaid work\n. Everything has been on hold at the site since January 2019, according to the offering memorandum, with the project\nfacing foreclosure\nin 2023 and filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy the following year..\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you why the project lost its funding,\u201d Tarczynski said. \u201cIt\u2019s because China took a different approach to managing its money, its currency, and midstream in the construction, they shut the window on currency exchange, the one with the dollar. So it became increasingly hard to pull money out of China.\u201d\nOceanwide owes about $400 million to creditors, according to court filings, including $180 million to EB-5 visa investors, $175 million to contractors led by Lendlease and $18 million to pay off county taxes,\nTRD\npreviously reported.\nThe fully entitled mixed-use project in Downtown Los Angeles includes a 49-story Park Hyatt hotel with 32 residential condominium levels, multifamily and retail components across three mixed-use towers, plus a fourth, three-level retail building, according to the offering memorandum. The complex was designed by CallisonRTKL, now operating as Arcadis.\nAll in, the project will have 504 residential units, 183 hotel rooms, roughly 160,000 square feet of retail space, 1,412 parking spaces and 57,522-square-foot prominent electronic display.\n\u201cYou have a project that\u2019s already $1.2 billion built and it\u2019s apartments and condos and hotel and retail and you\u2019re getting it for a huge bargain \u2014 picking it up for $450 million,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd your entitlements are rock solid in place, ready to go.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s compound in a tree-lined neighborhood in Palo Alto isn\u2019t sitting right with some neighbors.\nFor nearly 15 years, the Meta CEO has spent more than $110 million to buy at least 11 houses next to each other on Edgewood Drive and Hamilton Avenue in Palo Alto\u2019s Crescent Park neighborhood,\nThe New York Times\nreported. At times, the Facebook founder has paid as much as $14.5 million per property.\nFive of those parcels became a compound with a main house for him, his wife Priscilla Chan and his daughters, complete with guest homes, gardens, a pickleball court and a pool. The others are largely vacant, with one home used for entertainment and outdoor parties and the other operating for years as an unpermitted private school.\nUnderneath it all is 7,000 square feet of basement space that neighbors refer to as bunkers. Over the past eight years, constant construction has clogged the streets and plagued neighbors with noise. The neighbors also reportedly deal with cameras from Zuckerberg\u2019s property pointing at their homes as well as security guards patrolling the neighborhood.\n\u201cNo neighborhood wants to be occupied,\u201d Michael Kieschnick, whose home on Hamilton Avenue is bound on three sides by property owned by Zuckerberg, told the Times. \u201cBut that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019ve done. They\u2019ve occupied our neighborhood.\u201d Zuckerberg has offered to buy Kieschnick\u2019s home for over 30 years, but the homeowner has refused.\n\nThe city of Palo Alto has reportedly not stepped in to block Zuckerberg\u2019s expansion, purportedly going so far as to let the tech titan skirt local regulations and even get police to block off street parking.\n\u201cBillionaires everywhere are used to just making their own rules \u2014 Zuckerberg and Chan are not unique, except that they\u2019re our neighbors,\u201d Kieschnick said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a mystery why the city has been so feckless.\u201d\nIn addition to his Palo Alto compound, Zuckerberg also owns 2,300 acres on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, where he is building a compound with two mansions, tree houses connected by rope bridges and an underground shelter, as well as another compound on Lake Tahoe. This year, he dropped $23 million in cash for a 15,000-square-foot mansion in Washington, D.C.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Shoma Group proposes a 201-unit Live Local Act apartment project in Coral Gables, marking the first known development in the city under the state\u2019s affordable and workforce housing law.\nCoral Gables-based Shoma wants to build the 16-story Ponce 8 on a 0.8-acre site at 3808-3850 Southwest Eighth Street, near the Douglas Entrance office campus, according to the developer\u2019s news release. Designed by PPKS Architects, Ponce 8 will include 18,000 square feet of commercial space.\nShoma is led by married couple Masoud and Stephanie Shojaee.\nStephanie Shojaee\njoined \u201cReal Housewives of Miami\u201d as a\ncast member\nlate last year.\nShoma has the two-lot property under contract for an undisclosed price.\nThe sellers are Jilk Investments and ABC Development, both led by Jorge Gonzalez; and S17TPA Corporation, led by Adolfo, Alain and Amanda Bonvecchio, according to property and state corporate records.\nAt Ponce 8, 40 percent of units, or about 81, will be designated for households earning no more than 120 percent of the area median income, according to Shoma. That\u2019s in line with the\nLive Local Act\u2019s\nrequirement.\nThe state law, approved in 2023 and tweaked in the subsequent two years, allows bigger projects than permitted by a site\u2019s zoning as long as the buildings include apartments at workforce and affordable rents. At a minimum, 40 percent of the units have to be for households earning no more than 120 percent of the AMI for at least 30 years.\n\nThe Live Local Act is giving Ponce 8 more density and bigger floor area ratio (FAR), a measurement of a project\u2019s size. Shoma also is using Coral Gables\u2019 Mediterranean Bonus, a zoning designation that allows for two additional stories to 16 levels and also grants a bigger FAR.\nThe city\u2019s Mediterranean Bonus is for projects with designs that align with and invoke\nCoral Gables\n\u2019 traditional Mediterranean Revival architectural style, according to the city. Coral Gables was planned and developed by the late George Merrick.\nConstruction of Ponce 8 is expected to start in the second quarter of next year, according to Shoma. Completion is expected in the second quarter of 2028.\nShoma\u2019s\nother planned projects include the 24-story, 333-unit\nShoma Bay\ncondo tower with a Publix and an additional 15,600 square feet of retail in North Bay Village. This month, the firm scored a\n$30 million\npredevelopment loan, used to pay off existing financing on the site at 1872 79th Street Causeway.\nIn March, Shoma scrapped plans to redevelop a closed auto dealership at 3650 Bird Road in Miami, selling the site to 13th Floor Investments, LeFrak Organization and the P\u00e9rez family\u2019s Related Group for\n$35 million\n. Shoma had paid $34 million in 2022 for the site, which is approved for a pair of 40-story high-rises with 748 apartments and 20,000 square feet of retail.\nAcross South Florida, developers are seizing on the Live Local Act to supersize buildable capacity on sites. In May, Raanan Katz\u2019s RK Centers listed for sale the 8.1-acre former Sears at 3655 Southwest 22nd Street in Miami for more than\n$100 million\n, after getting a 1,050-unit Live Local Act project approved for the site.\nSpanish developer Pablo Castro and his local partner Laura Tauber, of Bay Harbor Islands-based Taubco, plan a\n4,032-unit\nLive Local Act project with seven 35-story towers at\u00a0 8395 Northwest 27th Avenue in West Little River. It\u2019s the biggest known planned Live Local Act project in South Florida.\n",

The price for the home, at 1908 North Halsted Street, works out to $478 per square foot.\nThe five-bedroom home was built in 1883 and features red brick siding and stone window lintels. The interior has been remodeled, and there is a roof-top deck and an alley-side garage.\nThe home was listed May 6 and went under contract May 14 for $5,000 above the asking price. Ryan Gossett and Omar Gonzalez of Compass represented the seller, Colin Marshall, and the Isbaras were represented by Souk Supantavong of Coldwell Banker.\n\nIsbara, who started her job a year ago, is an exhibited artist and was previously provost of Otis College of Art and Design in California.\nRecent sales and listings of Lincoln Park single-family homes have ranged in the single digit millions, most notably a 7,800-square-foot mansion on a\ndouble lot\nthat listed in June for $7.2 million, more than 30 percent above its 2022 sales price.

Residents, block associations, tenant groups, and small businesses will determine priorities through a participatory budgeting process.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard from many members of the community, who support our objective but wanted assurances that it would be administered fairly and in a way that truly allowed all of the West Side community\u2019s voice to be heard,\u201d the developers said in a statement\n\nMichael Phillips, president of the fund and of Jamestown, a real estate firm, said the influx could \u201csignificantly expand our impact\u201d and promised a focus on Hell\u2019s Kitchen.\nThe $1.5 million annual commitment and the cut of casino profits hinge on SL Green landing one of three state licenses to open its gaming and entertainment complex at 1515 Broadway.\nPublic hearings for the SL Green bid and a competing proposal from Silverstein Properties are set for Aug. 13 and Aug. 27, respectively. A six-member community advisory committee is expected to vote on advancing the proposals by the end of September.\nThe Manhattan Plaza pledge drew skepticism, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n, especially after news that the complex\u2019s tenant association president had been offered \u2014 and says she declined \u2014 a $20,000-a-month consulting contract from Roc Nation.\nThe reversal marks one of the first significant concessions from any casino bidder since the advisory process began.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Kylli is in danger of losing a 22-story office tower in San Francisco\u2019s Financial District.\nLenders for the building at 225 Bush Street have filed a lawsuit against the Burlingame-based company to place the office tower into receivership, the\nSan Francisco Business Times\nreported.\nKylli, the U.S. branch of Chinese investor Genzon, defaulted on a $350 million loan backed by the property last November. Its future hung in the balance as lenders mulled their next move. In March, lender\nDeutsche Bank looked to sell\nthe distressed building.\nThe building\u2019s lenders are looking to pursue judicial foreclosure, according to the Business Times. In doing so, they would be able to recoup all of the $350 million in debt backed by 225 Bush. Kylli has owned a majority stake in the building since 2014.\nIt\u2019s not the only option they\u2019re open to, however. The lawsuit mentions the possibility of lenders pursuing a nonjudicial foreclosure where they would receive only what the building might sell for at a future sale to repay the $350 million loan.\n\nThe lenders have asked the court to appoint Douglas Wilson Companies as 225 Bush\u2019s receiver. The San Diego-based firm was appointed earlier this year as receiver for Parkmerced, the largest apartment complex in San Francisco.\nHow much the 225 Bush building, constructed for Standard Oil in the early 20th century, would fetch in a purchase remains to be seen. Its appraised value fell to $153 million in December 2024, a\nnearly 75 percent drop\nfrom the $589 million it was appraised at in 2019, according to CMBS data cited by the Business Times.\nOccupancy at the office tower fell to 43 percent at the end of last year, as did revenues, tumbling from $40.3 million when the building was fully occupied in 2019 to $21.3 million last year, according to the Business Times. If it goes up for sale, the 580,000-square-foot building would be one of the largest office properties to hit the market in San Francisco post-pandemic.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Dallas City Council is set to decide what kind of investment and development could be built in a West Oak Cliff neighborhood, in a case dividing residents on how to shape the future of the community.\nThe rezoning case affects 35.25 acres centered on the intersection of Hampton Road and Clarendon Drive. It would allow mixed-use and small multifamily buildings and encourage pedestrian-friendly development, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. City officials have viewed the area as ripe for rezoning for such developments since 2019, and it\u2019s part of the city\u2019s broader efforts to encourage density and walkability in development.\nThe vote also comes as Texas Senate Bill 840, which takes effect Sept. 1, will require Texas cities to\nallow\nresidential development in nonresidential zones.\nWest, whose district includes the area, pitched the zoning change as protection for single-family homes and small businesses from large developments.\n\nThe rezoning could encourage development of vacant lots. A quarter of lots in the rezoning area are vacant, West said.\nThe rezoning would limit building heights to 50 feet and allow for only small-scale multifamily projects. Drive\u2013thrus would not be not allowed, and developments would be required to build out landscaping buffer zones and sidewalks. City Council\neliminated parking minimums\nfor smaller scale projects in May.\nThe zoning change comes with concerns about displacement and gentrification of the area\u2019s predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods. A petition opposing the rezoning circulated earlier this year, posted online by the Automotive Association of Oak Cliff. It garnered more than 1,000 signatures. The petition claimed the zoning changes could eventually spike property costs and drive out residents.\nFour of six neighborhood associations in West Oak Cliff signed letters of support for the rezoning, however, and the other two have not yet taken a stance on the matter.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Charles Cohen\u2019s Midtown East office building is continuing its valuation freefall.\nThe 31-story office building at 750 Lexington Avenue was recently valued at just $41 million \u2014 less than 14 percent of its $300 million valuation a decade ago, according to Morningstar Credit. It\u2019s the latest blow to the property after a lender won a judgement in a foreclosure case on the building last month. Cohen, a billionaire, personally guaranteed a $130 million loan on the property in 2015.\n750 Lex was constructed in 1988, at the corner of Lexington Avenue and East 59th Street, and is also called 1 International Plaza. Cohen Brothers Realty owned the building for decades and kept offices there.\nBut things started to go south during the pandemic as occupancy began to slip. Both its retail tenant, fashion brand Zara, and office tenants vacated the space in 2022. Cohen fell behind on payments.\nThen in 2023, beleaguered coworking company WeWork stopped paying rent. The building, which was once fully leased, fell to 69 percent occupancy. Net operating income was a quarter of what it was when the loan originated.\nWhen WeWork declared bankruptcy, Cohen negotiated a lease amendment that shortened the term and tied rent to the revenue from the office, according to Morningstar. But the next month, the building\u2019s valuation dropped to $50 million.\n\nAs of March, expenses have overtaken revenue at the office. Net operating income, which does not include debt service, is in the red at -$744,915, according to Morningstar.\nSpecial servicer LNR Partners filed a foreclosure case against the property last summer and won summary judgement last month. Cohen failed to pay taxes on the property, provide financial statements, and certify that his net worth and liquidity have not fallen, LNR said in its complaint. The servicer is pursuing foreclosure at the same time as it tries to work out the loan with the borrower, according to information provided by Morningstar.\nNeither LNR Partners nor an attorney for Cohen in the foreclosure case immediately responded to a request for comment.\nElsewhere, Cohen has been waging war with Fortress Capital. After the lender sued Cohen last year for defaulting on a $534 million portfolio that he had guaranteed, the firm won a $187 million judgement in February.\nCohen\u2019s personal net worth has sunk 57 percent since 2023, according to Forbes. It is now estimated at $1.6 billion.\n",

        "content": "And then there were eight. Again.\nThe Bally\u2019s Bronx casino proposal is back in the game just one month after City Council killed it.\nThe Council rejected the zoning changes Bally\u2019s needed to move forward with its $4 billion casino complex in the Bronx, but Mayor Eric Adams\nvetoed\nthe decision.\nThough Council leadership criticized the mayor\u2019s move, underscoring a broader battle brewing over the future of member deference, the body did not decide to take up the issue. The Council ran out the clock on its opportunity to override the veto, so the proposal will move forward with the seven other casino contenders.\nMeanwhile, SL Green Realty backtracked on its pledge to provide tenants of the apartment complex Manhattan Plaza with $22.5 million over the next 15 years, along with .5 percent of its Times Square casino\u2019s annual profits,\nCrain\u2019s reports\n. Instead, if SL Green ultimately receives one of the three state casino licenses up for grabs, it will provide that money to the West Side Community Fund, a charity whose donors include Related Companies, Jamestown, Brookfield Properties as well as other real estate firms and major corporations.\nThe original arrangement was unusual, but added to the list of big promises casino teams are making in hopes of building goodwill and gaining an edge over the competition. Manhattan Plaza is home to mostly performing artists \u2014\u00a0who could potentially counter the opposition SL Green is facing from the Broadway League. But some residents were skeptical and reportedly wanted to ensure that the money would be administered fairly and would benefit the community beyond their building.\nThe casino competition has dragged on for years and is expected to conclude by the end of the year. In our\nlatest issue of the magazine\n, I detailed some of the other twists and turns of the competition and how some teams may walk away with some wins even if they lose out on a casino license.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWith tariffs now in effect, what construction materials are being hit the hardest/how are developers and construction companies coping?\nSend a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Big is the name of the largest oyster found in a New York waterway in possibly 100 years,\naccording to the New York Times\n. At last weigh-in, Big was 2.63 pounds. That\u2019s down from the 2.8 pounds it weighed last year, when the Hudson River Park Trust\u2019s River Project last plucked Big from the Hudson River. Big\u2019s shell is home to 41 ribbed mussels and more than four dozen barnacles. The drop in weight may be related to the death of a former shell resident, another oyster.\n\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 Local residents and community groups in the upstate Finger Lakes region are demanding action from state officials after a cryptomining company has continued to operate a gas-fired power plant three years after being denied an air permit, according to\nGothamist\n. The company, Greenridge Generation, filed an appeal to the denial, allowing it to continue operating while the case made its way through the courts. Now that the case is back in front of a judge, local community members and groups say they will file a motion requesting evidentiary hearings to wrap up by year\u2019s end.\n\u2014 Zohran Mamdani is leading in mayoral polls against opponent Andrew Cuomo by 19 percent, per a new poll,\nCity &amp; State\nreports. The same poll showed that Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s lead against potential Republican opponent Rep. Elise Stefanik has shrunk 6 percentage points since June. Hochul is now ahead by 14 percentage points.\n\u2014 Local politicians are bracing for federal overreach in NYC after Trump deployed the National Guard in Washington, D.C., and put the city\u2019s police under federal control, according to\nThe City\n. \u201cWith Donald Trump, you can get any level of reaction on any given day, and he believes that he has some special privilege to interfere and meddle with the functions of New York City,\u201d Council member Keith Powers told the outlet. \u201cHe did it on congestion pricing and transportation, and certainly he\u2019ll do it again in the future when it comes to deploying the National Guard.\u201d\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$17.6 million\nfor a new-construction unit at 217 West 57th Street.

        "content": "One reader who has been following the\nsaga\nof model Aubrey Hill\u2019s subletter in\nThe Real Deal\nis the judge in his eviction case, Adam R. Meyers.\nThe judge observed that subletter Tasheem Jenkins was \u201cless focused and animated\u201d at his July 14 court appearance than at previous hearings, perhaps because \u201cof being the object of a media campaign seemingly designed to cause him embarrassment.\u201d\nTRD\u2019s \u201cmedia campaign\u201d aimed not to humiliate Jenkins but to depict how hard it can be for landlords to regain control of an apartment, even from someone with no authorization to live there, no resources, and a self-reported history of incarceration and substance abuse.\nThe articles showed Jenkins to be savvy enough to have lived rent-free in Apartment D of 367 Wadsworth Avenue since late 2023, despite the best efforts of the landlord\u2019s legal team to oust him.\nJenkins accomplished this with no lawyer, no legal training and no lease \u2014 just his own instincts and a set of keys from Hill, a fashion model and longtime family friend who left the country early last year after ignoring a signed agreement to repay her rent arrears.\nHill\u2019s subletter was by no means a savant. When evaluated by a medical professional sent by the Adams administration, Jenkins was unable to calculate how many quarters are in $2.75, even with assistance, and struggled to name the president of the United States, although he correctly guessed \u201cTrump.\u201d\nBut Jenkins was smart enough to hold onto Apartment D when Hill, the first high-fashion model from West Virginia, received an eviction notice and moved to Europe.\nMany rulings in the eviction case went against him, primarily because he showed no capacity to pay the tens of thousands of dollars in arrears, let alone the $1,675 rent going forward. Yet he cogently defended his rights in court and adroitly pivoted to new legal strategies every time eviction seemed imminent.\n\nJenkins showed the court his sublet agreement with Hill, who had hidden it from her landlord. He sought a\none-shot deal\nfrom the city to pay Hill\u2019s arrears, but could not get one without a lease. He applied for a\nCityFHEPS rental voucher\n. He claimed succession rights, saying he had lived with Hill for four years, but was denied. He had knee surgery and got a case number from Adult Protective Services, which later dropped him. He appealed court rulings. Each effort bought him more time.\nA default judgment was issued as far back as February 2024. At least once, a city marshal was days away from removing him from Apartment D.\nHis latest \u2014 and possibly final \u2014 potential savior was the Adams administration\u2019s Department of Social Services, which sought to have a guardian appointed to help Jenkins fight eviction. DSS wanted the owner of 367 Wadsworth Avenue, rather than a city-funded homeless shelter, to house him.\nIt was DSS that arranged for the medical evaluation, which took place in the contested apartment.\nBut now, Jenkins might have no cards left to play. Judge Meyers, a former advocate for tenants, declined last month to appoint a guardian, noting that Jenkins had been \u201ca capable and creative self-advocate\u201d and had quit drugs and alcohol last year.\nWith a flourish of legalese, the judge essentially paraphrased economist Herb Stein\u2019s famous saying, \u201cIf something cannot go on forever, it will stop.\u201d\n\u201cPetitioner was awarded judgment of possession against Jenkins almost a year ago, and its ability to realize this relief cannot be delayed indefinitely,\u201d the judge wrote.\nHe paused the eviction through Aug. 29, giving Jenkins time \u201cto vacate the premises with dignity.\u201d\n",

It was most recently reduced to just under $20 million in May.\nCompass\u2019 Josh Flagg and Douglas Elliman\u2019s Josh Altman represented the Dubrows. Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s Christina Pope and Forward Luxury Estates\u2019 Gary Reavis represented the buyer, who sources say is from overseas.\nThe Dubrows bought the property in 2023 for a reported $16 million from a trust tied to the late filmmaker Martha De Laurentiis. De Laurentiis had lived in the home with her late husband and film producer Dino De Laurentiis.\n\nThe nearly 9,000-square-foot mansion has five bedrooms and nine bathrooms, perched high above Beverly Hills. Designed in the French Normandy-style, the home sits on an over 6-acre lot with a tennis court, multiple outdoor dining and entertainment areas, pool, spa and terrace, according to the listing.\nWhile luxury real estate is trading within the county, several high-profile closings have missed the mark when it comes to getting close to the original ask.\nActor\nJim Carrey\nhad been trying to sell his Brentwood home since 2023 and finally closed on a buyer for it last week.

        "content": "Chicago investor Chikoo Patel and his partner Shai Wolkowicki are sinking deeper into multifamily distress for deals across Illinois, public records show.\nAfter Patel took heat from tenants this spring for allegedly deplorable conditions in South Shore apartment units managed by his Chicago-based firm CKO Real Estate, investors and lenders are pursuing him and Wolkowicki for nearly $20 million total in various court cases.\nThe claims range from failing to pay off large mortgages, to bilking investment partners out of more than $1 million through a Southwest Side townhomes deal, court records show. The allegations show that even as\nPatel and Wolkowicki were working to gain an interest\nin more distressed Chicago multifamily properties at attractive prices, they were also losing their grip due to a series of mistakes on investments they already owned.\nAn attorney for Patel declined to comment, and Wolkowicki \u2014 who recently split amicably from his previous firm GW Properties that involved a partnership with developer Mitch Goltz \u2014 didn\u2019t return requests for comment.\nBrothers Nishant and Vishal Tulsian are putting Patel\u2019s property management practices under the microscope in the Southwest Side case, which stems from financial trouble the trio encountered after purchasing a 24-unit townhouse property in 2020 for $1.8 million. The property is mostly rented to federally subsidized tenants at 4500 West 45th Street just north of Midway International Airport.\nThe siblings claim in a lawsuit filed in Texas court last month that Patel \u201cfraudulently induced them to invest in the W. 45th St. venture; embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars from W. 45th St. LLC, including by paying himself hundreds of thousands of dollars in unauthorized or excessive reimbursements in breach of their Operating Agreement; willfully neglected the W. 45th St. property and the W. 45th St. LLC business, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages including lost revenue and fees for years of unpaid utility bills; covered up his neglect and embezzlement with numerous lies; and exposed W. 45th St. LLC to significant potential liability to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\u201d\nTheir lawsuit shows HUD removed Patel\u2019s firm as manager of the property in June and replaced it with Gilead Management. The suit also claims Patel never paid his $175,000 capital contribution to the LLC to stake his claim in the property, while the brothers, who lacked low-income housing investment experience, put up all the money to buy the property and relied on Patel\u2019s expertise.\n\nSo far, the biggest debt Patel and Wolkowicki are late paying is owed to Old National Bank, which claims they\u2019re late paying off nearly $16 million for a mortgage on a 220-unit property in Springfield, the Illinois capital downstate from their homebase in Chicago. The property, known as Pine Ridge Apartments, at 1833 Seven Pines Road, was purchased by Patel and Wolkowicki for a little more than $16 million, or $73,000 per unit, in 2023. But Old National last month began pursuing foreclosure and collection of a guarantee that Wolkowicki and Patel signed to secure the loan.\nThe Old National loan wasn\u2019t scheduled to mature until 2026, but the borrowers defaulted on making monthly payments starting in April, the suit said.\nFurthermore, a company called Cucumber Capital claims Patel\u2019s CKO was set to borrow more than $110,000 by pledging future business revenues as repayment, including from the Springfield property, but defaulted on the agreement, according to a lawsuit filed in Connecticut.\nLegal trouble is ramping up for Patel and Wolkowicki about a year after they were helping Milwaukee-based landlord F Street Investments raise cash to buy $35 million worth of South Side multifamily properties that were in various stages of financial distress. However, public records show that buildings within the portfolios they were targeting haven\u2019t yet changed hands. Meanwhile, a lender has initiated foreclosure actions for a handful of them that are owned by Chicago-based Catalyst Realty. F Street executives didn\u2019t answer questions about the status of the transactions they had planned and instead referred inquiries to Wolkowicki.\nChicago-based lender\nRenovo Financial\nearlier this month also sued Patel for allegedly failing to fulfill a guarantee tied to the 13-unit apartment building at 7655 South Coles Avenue in Chicago.\nPatel still owes Renovo nearly $54,000 in connection with a loan he took out on the building in partnership with Wolkowicki\u2019s firm Salina Investment Partners, the suit claims. Patel and Wolkwocki\u2019s ventures borrowed $833,000 from Renovo for the property in 2023, but the lender is still seeking payment from Patel even after Wolkowicki appears to have recapitalized the property earlier this year through Salina and an investment partner by getting a new, larger loan from Pan American Bank &amp; Trust.\nPatel has yet to respond in court to the allegations in court. He settled a lawsuit earlier this summer over a nearly $100,000 claim that Broad Shoulders Flats LLC made against him for allegedly mismanaging funds derived from CKO\u2019s operation of a 12-unit building at 1513-17 West Diversey Parkway in Chicago that the LLC owns.\n",

However, fitness centers and entertainment retail have been quick to fill space in Texas, contributing significantly to the state\u2019s low vacancy rates.\nThe vacancy rate halfway through the year was lower than the 20-year historic average in Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio, according to Partners Real Estate. Houston had the highest vacancy at 5.5 percent.\nIn DFW, where the retail vacancy rate is 4.8 percent, compared to a historic average of 6.4 percent, Crunch Fitness, EoS Fitness and the Picklr had leased 115,000 square feet halfway through this year. Crunch has also leased almost 44,000 square feet in Austin and over 54,000 square feet in San Antonio.\n\nOther fitness and play concepts include pickleball club Dill Dinkers, which leased 24,000 square feet in San Antonio; NRG Trampoline, which leased almost 47,000 square feet in San Antonio; Jumping World, which leased over 31,000 square feet in Houston; and Sky Zone, which leased 40,000 in Houston.\nMeanwhile,\ngrocery-anchored shopping centers\nare burgeoning to accommodate Texas\u2019 population growth, dominating retail development.\nGrocery store closures in Texas reflect local competition as much as national pressure, said Steve Triolet, senior vice president of research at Partners.

        "content": "A developer planned to complete a 141-unit apartment building in Miami\u2019s Wynwood Norte neighborhood last year.\nThe project was first revealed in the fall of 2022. Yet, instead of starting construction, Evolve Companies listed the six-lot assemblage for sale this spring, asking $14 million.\nAcross South Florida, developers who planned\nmultifamily\nbuildings in recent years are now quietly putting the sites up for sale, according to online listings and experts.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a secret that the market cycle for new construction multifamily is ending,\u201d said broker Tony Arellano. \u201cInterest rates are higher, development costs are higher, concessions [to apartment tenants] are higher.\u201d\nThe uptick in listings comes as the tri-county region\u2019s market turned. Multifamily boomed in the three years after the pandemic started, fueled by an influx of out-of-staters that created\nunprecedented demand\nand\nrecord rent\ngrowth. Developers seized on the bonanza by quickly completing new projects. But in the past two years, inflation and elevated interest rates have made construction more expensive, and the development flurry created a\nsupply overhang\n, lowering rents. The Trump administration\u2019s tariff and\nimmigration policies\nthrew more uncertainty into the market.\nFor many developers, the risks are too high and returns too low to build apartments, experts said.\n\u201cAll the big developers and players tell us [that] if it wasn\u2019t shovels in the ground by a couple of months ago or last year, they are not going vertical,\u201d said broker Sebastian Faerman.\nBut, he cautioned, not everyone is selling multifamily sites because they are priced out of construction. Some are \u201cland guys,\u201d whose business model is to purchase, entitle and flip properties. Others are\nLive Local Act\ninvestors who are using the state law to supersize development entitlements and now want to flip the sites for a profit. The two-year-old state law allows for bigger projects as long as 40 percent of units in the new buildings are below-market rentals.\nIt isn\u2019t clear how many sellers marketing multifamily development sites are feeling the sting from higher construction costs and interest rates. Developers interviewed for this story cited various reasons for listing their properties, vehemently denying it\u2019s because of costs or expected lower returns.\n\u201cDevelopers can\u2019t tell you, \u2018We are hurting \u2026 we need to get a buyer.\u2019\u201d said broker Miguel Pinto.\n\u201cSome of these guys bought at the top of the market. They were overleveraged, and they thought everything was going to keep being peachy, that the rents would be peachy, that with Trump being in power, interest rates would have dropped,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of that has happened.\u201d\nThe pain is widespread, and a crop of developers are in a bind, said Pinto, of Apex Capital Realty. They own land that is not producing income and is costing them in property tax bills, and is financed with loans with looming maturities, he added.\nEven those not listing their sites on the market, will consider an offer. \u201cIf it\u2019s not publicly for sale, it\u2019s still for sale,\u201d Pinto said. \u201cEveryone is a net seller right now. All it takes is one call to their office.\u201d\nToo much in Wynwood\nClara Homes\u2019 147-unit planned apartment tower in\nWynwood\nisn\u2019t going exactly as intended.\nFor more than a year, the Miami-based firm worked on the\nproposal\n, paying $7.7 million for the nearly half-acre site, scoring approval from a city design review board and publicizing the 22-story Clara Wynwood project.\nLast month, Clara Homes listed the site for $10.9 million.\n\u201cPre-Covid, there were two vertical buildings in Wynwood. Post-Covid, there were 36,\u201d Arellano, who is marketing the site, said. \u201cSo we have provided a tremendous supply of market-rate rentals.\u201d\nA record 18,600 apartments were completed last year in South Florida, outpacing 15,000 net new leases signed, CoStar Group data shows. That followed 15,300 units completed in 2023; 11,200 in 2022, and 10,700 in 2021.\nThe hefty completions were mostly of high-end market-rate rentals in urban cores, including Wynwood, according to CoStar\u2019s Juan Arias, director of market analytics for South Florida.\nAs a result, rents are no longer rising. The average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Wynwood is $3,049 this month, down 2 percent from last month, and down 7 percent from last year, according to\nZumper\n. A two-bedroom is $4,500, flat compared to last month, and a 2 percent drop from last year. A three-bedroom is $5,722, down 1 percent from last month, and flat, year-over-year, Zumper data shows.\nJames Curnin, founder of Clara Homes, conceded Wynwood has high inventory. But he said that\u2019s not why he listed the Clara Wynwood site. If the firm builds the project, the supply will be absorbed by the time the tower is completed, he said.\n\u201cI just want to move to bigger and better things,\u201d said Curnin, who also cited issues with a protracted site plan approval process.\nEvolve Companies, based in Greensboro and Wilmington, North Carolina, paid roughly $18.8 million in two deals for a pair of multifamily development sites in Miami\u2019s\nWynwood Norte\narea in 2022, marking the firm\u2019s South Florida debut. It hired architect Kobi Karp and submitted proposals for a pair of buildings along Northwest Fifth Avenue. In March, Evolve scored approval for the first\neight-story, 141-unit building\n.\nA month later, Evolve listed the roughly 1-acre site on the market for $14 million, as well as the 0.7-acre property for its second project, a planned\n11-story building with 105 units\n, for $12 million.\nEvolve\u2019s forte is garden-style apartment complexes in states elsewhere in the Southeast, brokers marketing the site said.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t really have boots on the ground in Miami, and they are more based in North Carolina. We have solidified for them a great [joint venture] partner\u201d for the 141-unit project, said George Belesis, of Dwntwn, who is marketing the sites.\nThe firm may pursue the 105-unit project or may turn it into a Live Local Act project, added Dwntwn\u2019s Wilson Alers, who is also marketing the properties.\nEvolve, led by Mike Winstead Jr. and Joe McKinney, didn\u2019t return requests for comment.\nCurnin\u2019s Clara Wynwood site also could secure a partner through marketing, or he may lease the one-story, 11,400-square-foot building. The Austin Burke menswear retailer that had occupied the property for decades closed this year.\nDwntwn\u2019s Devlin Marinoff, who also is marketing Curnin\u2019s site, noted that the market is currently in a multifamily absorption cycle. \u201cIt\u2019s the ordinary lifecycle of real estate,\u201d he said.\nOut with the \u201cless tested\u201d\nDuring the multifamily boom, developers homed in on\nsouth Miami-Dade County\n, an area with an ample supply of discounted buildable land. They filed a flurry of project proposals.\nNow, many of their sites have popped up for sale.\nDevelopers with projects in urban cores who expanded to south Miami-Dade are getting stretched too thin with pending plans and are more likely to let go of their south county sites, said Faerman, of FA Commercial.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s in [Miami\u2019s] Edgewater or Wynwood, they are still going to go vertical,\u201d he said. But in \u201cless tested\u201d south Miami-Dade, \u201cthere\u2019s less [comparables] to look at to see what is actually achievable\u201d for rents.\nK2 Capital Group, led by Mariano Karner and Esteban Koffsmon, paid $4 million last year for a 2.6-acre site in\nGoulds\n. The firm proposed an\neight-story, 206-unit apartment project\nin May. The land, which allows up to 12 stories and 320 units, is now on the market, with an asking price of about $6.3 million, according to Faerman, the listing broker.\n\u201cIf someone wants to pay a premium, I would consider selling,\u201d Koffsmon said, adding the listing is more of a market \u201ctest\u201d and a potential path to finding a partner for K2 Capital\u2019s growing development pipeline.\nElsewhere in Miami-Dade, some multifamily developers have dealt with higher costs and less demand by\nswitching their apartment projects to condos\n.\nThe problem? Not every multifamily site works for condos, Pinto said. Those who couldn\u2019t do a condo conversion are now looking for an equity infusion to help start their projects, and finding slim pickings.\n\u201cWhen you have rates so high, you can put risk-free money in bonds or the money market at 5 [percent] or 6 percent. So why would you take a risk with a developer,\u201d Pinto said. \u201cOne thing is you buying the property with investors, another is getting money from investors to start building right now. For multifamily, it\u2019s very, very hard.\u201d\nTide coming in?\nThe uptick in listings of development sites is a sign the market\u2019s picking up \u2014 not that it\u2019s slowing, said broker Chris Lentz.\nEconomic tailwinds are in store: Banks are reentering capital markets, loan spreads are narrowing and construction costs are decreasing, he said. The fear of tariffs has been abated because the \u201cimpact to costs was not as significant as anticipated,\u201d and interest rates fell slightly, with bigger cuts expected, Lentz added. He cited Chicago-based financial services firm CME Group\u2019s prediction of a 94 percent probability of a 25 basis point rate cut at the Fed\u2019s meeting next month.\n\u201cIf anything, we are actually starting to see higher transaction velocity, and that may be why people may want to test the market again,\u201d said Lentz of Cushman &amp; Wakefield.\nThis month, Swire Properties sold a nearly 1-acre development site proposed for 350 condos and 180 hotel keys to Dubai-based hospitality firm Kerzner International for\n$45 million\n.\n\u201cWe are seeing renewed activity with more capitalizations of developments and more acquisitions of sites,\u201d Lentz said.\nSites like Swire\u2019s are exceptions, Pinto countered. It\u2019s \u201cthe guys that bought B and C sites\u201d that are trying to sell now, he said.\nHe also expects an interest rate reprieve, which could come when Jerome Powell\u2019s term as the Fed\u2019s chair ends next spring. Until then, it won\u2019t be easy for overleveraged developers that are priced out of construction.\n\u201cThey bought [land], thought they would build it, [and] the world turned on them,\u201d Pinto said. \u201cThings will shake out, and that\u2019s when we will know who had a backup plan and the financial wherewithal.\u2026 As the old saying goes, \u2018When the tide goes out, we see who is swimming naked.\u2019\u201d\n",

        "content": "The 21-story Wedbush Center in Downtown Los Angeles was recently appraised at $60.5 million compared with a $197.5 million value at loan issuance, according to Morningstar Credit.\nThat\u2019s a 69 percent decline in around seven years.\nThe Class A building\u2013which faces the stretch of the 110 Freeway that cuts through the city\u2019s center\u2013is worth less than half the $128 million commercial mortgage-backed securities debt balance connected to the Cerberus Capital Management-owned building. The private equity firm\npurchased\nthe 475,000-square-foot office building at 1000 Wilshire Boulevard for $196 million from Lincoln Property Company in 2018.\nCerberus Capital Management did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe debt\nlanded\nin special servicing after Cerberus Capital Management missed its March maturity amid plummeting occupancy, an issue for a lot of Downtown office towers. Occupancy at the Wedbush Center dropped to 67 percent at the end of last year compared to 87 percent at loan underwriting.\n\nA special servicer is reviewing resolution alternatives, according to Morningstar. But things could soon get worse as the building\u2019s name tenant, its largest, plans to vacate once its lease expires at the end of the year. Wedbush Securities is\nditching\n100,000 square feet Downtown for a smaller space in Pasadena, ending a more than 20-year residency at the building under multiple owners.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal, a very big decision for the firm,\u201d chief executive and president Gary Wedbush said then. \u201cThe pandemic and COVID created a different kind of office for us. There are places like Pasadena that seem to have recovered more fully from the pandemic than Downtown Los Angeles has. That was a part of the decision-making.\u201d\nDowntown Los Angeles currently has an office vacancy rate of nearly 33 percent. Tenants are fleeing to places such as\nCentury City\n, where they can entice workers back to their desks with offices that have ample amenities and where homelessness is less of a concern.\nPasadena, meanwhile, also has seen some distress in its office sector. A nine-story office tower in the San Gabriel Valley city saw its value\nslashed\nin half after a recent appraisal and a two-building complex recently\nsold\nat a deep discount.\n",

The deal works out to about $1,969 per square foot, aligning with values prevalent in Palo Alto and other high-demand office markets before the pandemic\u2019s outbreak five years ago.\nInspire Real Estate Holdings sold the property. The Florida-based company bought it from Hewlett-Packard in 2003 for an undisclosed price.\nThe four-story building spans approximately 38,000 square feet, according to the\nSilicon Valley Business Journal\n. The property is near Stanford University and the Palo Alto\nCaltrain\nstation. Ground-floor retail tenants including Salt &amp; Straw, Nola, Citibank and the Shade Store.\nOther office buildings in downtown Palo Alto that fetched similar prices per square foot before the pandemic include 192 Lytton Avenue for $23.1 million, or $2,551 a square foot; 530 Lytton Avenue for $117.5 million, or $2,156 a square foot; 150 Forest Avenue for $26 million, or $2,153 a square foot; and 385 Sherman Avenue for $138 million, or $2,030 a square foot.\n\nElsewhere in Palo Alto, office property sales have run the gamut from bargain-basement prices to nearly reaching pre-pandemic values, amid the market\u2019s rocky recovery.\nLast year, Hudson Pacific Properties sold a 182,700-square-foot office campus at\n4001-4009 Miranda Avenue\nto an undisclosed buyer for $23 million, or about $126 per square foot. In 2023, Greenbrae-based Douglas Living Trust bought a 30,000-square-foot office building at\n2555 Park Boulevard\nin south Palo Alto from Kenson Ventures for $58 million, or about $2,000 per square foot.\nIn 2023, after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, First Citizens Bank &amp; Trust bought $167 billion in assets and $119 billion in deposits from the failed institution. It\u2019s now a division of First Citizens BancShares, which also owns First Citizens Bank.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Five of the condominium\u2019s 16 units are still on the market, including another penthouse asking just under $3 million.\nSerhant\u2019s Raquel Lomonico represented the sponsor in the deal, according to the deal sheet. Alison Glestein, a member of Lomonico\u2019s five-person team, brought the buyer.\nLomonico said she stepped away from the project after finding a buyer for the penthouse and six other condos at the building. Another team from Serhant and one at Compass are heading sales of the project\u2019s remaining units.\n\nEast Williamsburg, like neighboring Williamsburg and Greenpoint, is historically known for its rental and townhouse stock rather than new development condos.\nBut the neighborhood has been buoyed by a slate of condo projects along the heavily trafficked L subway line. Before 392 Graham Avenue and the Umbrella Factory at 710 Metropolitan Avenue notched record-setting deals, a condo at the Milk Factory at 850 Metropolitan Avenue pushed\npricing to new heights\nwhen it sold for $1,667 a foot.\nDeal prices in East Williamsburg have been on the rise, with the median sale price hitting just under $1.5 million in June, up 19 percent year-over-year, according to data from Redfin.\nStill, the neighborhood is less expensive than Williamsburg and Greenpoint, where waterfront new development condos such as Miki Naftali\u2019s Williamsburg Wharf and Quadrum Global\u2019s the Huron have redefined their condo markets. In Williamsburg, Two Trees Management\u2019s One Domino Square scored the\nmost expensive deal\non a price per square foot basis when a penthouse traded for more than $3,000 a foot.\n",

        "content": "As downtown Los Angeles continues a lengthy post-pandemic office market recovery, the plummeting of values so far could prove beneficial in addressing another looming issue: The\ncity\u2019s housing crisis\n.\nCase in point: The redevelopment of the L.A. Care tower downtown into high-end housing,\nThe Los Angeles Times\nreported.\nDeveloper Garrett Lee of\nJamison Properties\nis preparing to begin the transformation of the nearly 610,000-square-foot building at 1055 West 7th Street into 691 luxury residences, a plan,\nfirst floated in 2023\n. Current tenants include the Central Civil West courthouse of Los Angeles Superior Court and the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.\nAs it stands, Downtown L.A. has 54 office buildings that are at immediate risk of losing value, with a potential $70 billion possibly disappearing over the next 10 years, according to a new\nreport\nfrom BAE Urban Economics and cited by the Times. That worst-case scenario would create a loss of $353 million in property tax receipts and other related revenue streams for the public sector.\n\u201cDeclining assessed values are likely to translate into significant losses in General Fund revenue\u201d for the city, the report said. Housing conversions such as the L.A. Care tower project might be a silver bullet to increase buildings\u2019 values and occupancy rates, according to the report.\n\nIf developers converted 10 large office buildings into housing, it would boost their combined assessed property value by $12 billion over a decade, the report said. That would add $46 million in tax revenue and more than 3,800 residential units to the housing supply.\nApartment occupancy in Downtown L.A. has been slightly higher than pre-pandemic levels at\nabout 90 percent\n. The city center has also seen a spike in housing construction in recent years, with 22 percent of new housing built in the city over the past decade rising in downtown, according to the Times.\nTurning unused offices into housing is on city officials\u2019 list of priorities, Rachel Freeman, the city\u2019s deputy mayor of business and economic development, told the Times.\n\u201cWe have a deep need for more housing at all levels of affordability,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cAdaptive reuse has the potential to be a tool to help achieve our goals towards housing production and also the revitalization of our core urban centers.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Real estate firm Ponte Equities is cashing in on a piece of 70 Vestry Street.\nThe family-run firm sold unit 10W for $18.5 million to another owner in the building, in what one broker who has sold in the building called a \u201csuper off-market\u201d deal.\nThe sale is the first at 70 Vestry for Ponte, which sold the site that became the luxury condo to Related in 2014 for $115 million. As part of the deal, Ponte was allowed to buy\n15 of the 46 units that Related developed\nat the site for a steep discount.\nThe two firms have partnered on a number of projects in the area, where the Ponte family accumulated a small real estate empire of parking garages, warehouses and auto shops in the 1960s.\nPonte was given a sweet deal on the units, paying almost $37 million, or an average of $2.45 million per unit. The original offering plan priced the units at over $142 million combined, or roughly $9.5 million per unit.\nUnit 10W was priced at $12.5 million on the original offering plan. The unit has not been publicly listed, but spans 2,600 square feet and has three bedrooms and three full bathrooms, according to the offering plan.\nA member of the family declined to comment on the sale of the unit.\nThe anonymous buyer already owns the northern unit on the 10th floor, which they bought for $27 million in 2018. The buyer plans to combine the units, according to a source familiar with the deal.\n\nAn attorney for the buyer did not respond to a request for comment.\nPonte has been renting out a number of the units, according to StreetEasy.\nIn January, Unit 7B rented for $62,000 per month. Last fall, Unit 6F rented for $38,000 and Unit 6E rented for $48,000 per month.\nArran Patel, Clayton Orrigo and Stephen Ferrara of Compass\u2019 Hudson Advisory Team have been the listing agents for the rental units.\nAlthough it\u2019s difficult to peg a price change to the unit given the original bulk sale, other resales in the highly sought-after building have generally snagged premiums.\nOn average, units in the building have sold for 22 percent more than their original sale price, according to an analysis by Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group provided to\nThe Real Deal\n.\nThis year, a fifth-floor unit closed for $8.6 million, 25 percent above its original sale price, and a fourth-floor unit closed for $9.6, 16 percent above its original sale price.\n",

A sale price wasn\u2019t disclosed, but sources told\nThe Real Deal\nit changed hands for $70 million, or $108 per square foot.\nThe ground lease with Sol Goldman Investments still has 60 years left on it. The balance on the leasehold\u2019s loan, last known to be\nrefinanced in 2019\n, is $182 million.\nCBRE\u2019s Doug Middleton and Jack Stillwagon negotiated the leasehold interest sale.\nA source close to the transaction noted that RXR viewed the asset in the \u201cfilm\u201d category, not up to the standard of the \u201cdigital\u201d assets the company prizes.\nRepresentatives for both Lincoln Property and Cross Ocean referenced the importance of the asset\u2019s strong cash flow in teaming up for the first time to acquire the 650,000-square-foot property, according to\nGlobe St\n.\n\nRXR\nacquired the building\nin 2014 for slightly under $195 million, its first purchase in Downtown Brooklyn, and one of the largest office deals in borough history. The firm quickly got going on a $74 million renovation and upgrade to the property, which was converted to an office in 2012 after about a decade as a data center.\nThe building is fully leased, largely to the New York City Human Resources Administration and the New York City Housing Authority. There\u2019s 20,000 square feet of retail space on the ground floor; wholesale retailer Boxed signed a lease for 15,000 square feet in 2022 at an asking rent of $50 per square foot, according to the\nCommercial Observer\n.\nThe leasehold interest sale marks just the fourth office investment for Cross Ocean, which has approximately $10 billion in assets under management. It is, however, the asset manager\u2019s sixth investment in the New York metro area in the last year.\nLincoln Property has also made a half-dozen investments in the area in the last year or so.

The sellers listed the home last spring for slightly under $6 million.\nDubbed \u201cWestland,\u201d the property last traded hands a decade ago for $4.3 million. The seller could not be reached for comment by the outlet, while the buyer\u2019s information was not disclosed.\nThe sale of the 6,400-square-foot home breaks down to $828 per square foot. The property includes six bedrooms and seven bathrooms.\nThe home was built before the Civil War for Sen. Robert F. Stockton, a naval commodore who was a descendant of a Declaration of Independence signee. The property spans one-and-a-half acres; the Colonial-style home had its facade restored two decades ago to resemble the property\u2019s Cleveland era. Features include 12-foot ceilings and oversized windows.\n\nCleveland shacked up at the Princeton abode at the conclusion of his second presidential term, living there for the last decade of his life. The property is a National Historic Landmark and has a spot on the National Register of Historic Places.\nMaura Mills of Callaway Henderson Sotheby\u2019s International \u2013 Princeton had the\nlisting\n. Queenston Realty\u2019s Carina Krall procured the buyer, who was \u201cattracted to the home\u2019s majestic appearance and feel, its history, its location in a diverse and exciting community, its condition, and its warmth for everyday living,\u201d according to Mills.\nIt\u2019s exceedingly rare for a presidential home to remain a private residence long-term, as they are often repurposed for civic use. Incidentally, another president\u2019s former home in Princeton, a Tudor Revival built for Woodrow Wilson, is being marketed for $6.5 million.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

Gambino declined to comment.\nRecords through Propertyshark show the home last traded in 2006 from singer-songwriter Ricky Martin to Michael S. Smith and his wife Iris Smith. Ownership has since been shuttled from trusts to most recently a shell company called 1309 Davies LLC, which has a Broomfield, Colo. address tied to Blue Spruce Capital Corp.\nPrevious ownership of the home tells quite the history. Among the list of those who once called the property home are Martin and Oscar winner Michael Caine, whose credits include \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d and \u201cThe Cider House Rules\u201d among other titles. The family of actress and singer Doris Day also at one time owned the property.\nWhomever moves in will be rubbing shoulders with equally as high profile a group in the area\u2019s neighbors.\nAbout a 10-minute walk away is the\nPritzker Estate\nat\n1261 Angelo Drive\n. The home is currently listed for $175 million but asked as much as $195 million in October. It\u2019s being sold by Hyatt Hotels heir Anthony Pritzker and his ex-wife and philanthropist Jeanne Pritzker.\n\nLess than three miles away in Bel-Air is 875 Nimes Road, which is known as Chartwell Estate. The mansion, which was used in the opening credits of \u201cThe Beverly Hillbillies\u201d TV show, was purchased by News Corp chair and Fox Corp. CEO\nLachlan Murdoch\n, who paid $150 million for it in 2019. It was the priciest deal in the state\u2019s history at the time.\nThe Davies Drive home spans a little over 9,200 square feet and has six beds and 12 baths.\nThe gated estate\u2019s motor court has room for more than 20 cars, with the over two-acre lot holding a main residence, guest house, tennis court, children\u2019s playground, security house, orchard, herb and rose gardens.\nAmong the main home\u2019s highlights are a theater with a snack room, along with a primary suite that touts its own terrace and massage room.\n",

The Crown Heights building will span seven stories and include unit sizes ranging between one- and two-bedrooms.\nPrices at the development start at just under $600,000 for a one-bedroom condo with a small terrace on the first floor. The priciest apartment is a two-bedroom unit featuring two terraces on the top floor, with an asking price of roughly $1.6 million.\nDetails about the project are surfacing after a years-long battle with community groups over a series of proposed developments at the site of the former Spice Factory.\nIn 2017, developer Bruch Eichner and his partner, Lincoln Equities,\nsought to rezone\nthe parcel and build two 39-story towers, a plan that was rejected by the City Planning Commission over concerns that the structures would cast shadows over the garden. Eichner revised the plan to include a building height of only 14 stories, but the commission once again rejected it.\n\nSpice Factory owner Zev Golombeck, who had initially agreed to sell to Eichner\u2019s Continuum Companies and Lincoln Equities if they scored the rezoning approval, filed his own plans to build a six-story, 239-unit project in 2022, but instead\nsold the site\nto Isaac Hager and Daryl Hagler for $43 million.\nSchwartz\u2019s YS Developers then purchased the site from Hager and Hagler last May for\n$64 million\n, backed by a $42 million loan from G4 Capital Partners. The investment firm also provided $75 million in construction financing.\nUnder Eichner\u2019s initial plans, the development would have added a significant number of union-built, affordable rental apartments, in addition to the market-rate units, to the neighborhood. Instead, under Schwartz\u2019s plans, the project will yield market-rate condos asking more than $1,200 per square foot.\nLast November, Eichner\nreached an agreement\nwith City Council member Crystal Hudson to move forward with a project at the neighboring 962-964 Franklin Avenue. Plans for the site include 355 apartments, 106 of which will be income-restricted.\n",

At the top of the list is Los Angeles County with 846 tracts eligible for Opportunity Zone 2.0 tax incentives, while Orange County has 138.\nThe Bay Area is also rife with Opportunity Zone tracts. This includes 105 in Alameda County, 88 in Santa Clara County, 84 in San Francisco County, 71 in Contra Costa County, 34 in San Mateo County, 22 in Solano County, 13 in Sonoma County, and 12 in Marin County.\nThe previous version of the Opportunity Zone program exceeded expectations when it came to apartment openings and units under construction in designated opportunity zones.\n\nAbout 68,000 more units have opened in the Opportunity Zones than the pace that developers were completing before the tax break went into effect, according to\nCoStar\n. The estimated value of those units is estimated to be more than $18 billion.\nNationwide, apartments in Opportunity Zones make up a larger percentage of all the new units that open each year. In 2017, unit openings in Opportunity Zones accounted for 12 percent of all U.S. units, according to CoStar data. The following year \u2014 the first that the tax breaks became available \u2014 it increased to 14 percent in 2018. It climbed to 15 percent in both 2019 and 2020 and rose to 18 percent in 2021. Today, 23 percent of apartments now under construction will open in Opportunity Zones, according to CoStar.\nZones in the city of Los Angeles benefitted the most. Before the tax breaks, Opportunity Zones in L.A. had 1,245 new units, per CoStar. Last year, developers opened 3,432 apartments in these zones, while another 7,441 units are under construction.\nThe Opportunity Zone 2.0 program will officially open for investment on Jan. 1, 2027.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Haussmann Development is moving ahead with plans for a major residential project in Jamaica, Queens, taking over a stalled KD Sagamore Capital site and upping the unit count.\nJosef Goodman\u2019s firm, through a limited liability company, filed plans with the city Department of Buildings for a 14-story, 207,000-square-foot building at 159-31 90th Avenue, PincusCo\nreported\n. The GF55 Partners-designed project will hold between 205 and 259 apartments \u2014 the precise number varies across project filings \u2014 along with a church sanctuary seating 400, offices for the First Reformed Dutch Church of Jamaica and an on-site apartment for its pastor.\nThe site has a complicated recent history. In 2019, KD Sagamore signed a 99-year ground lease with the church valued at $8.8 million, following court approval. KD Sagamore then filed plans for a 136-unit building, but never broke ground.\nWhile a lease transfer hasn\u2019t been publicly recorded, Haussmann states in its filing that it controls the property through its LLC. The firm similarly took over KD Sagamore\u2019s Arris Grand development in Clinton Hill a few months back; in March, Haussmann scored a $49.5 million loan to refinance the nine-story, mixed-use complex with 113 apartments, the Commercial Observer\nreported\n.\nThe latest filing for the 90th Avenue project calls for apartments on floors two through 14, as well as amenities like a lounge, recreation room and outdoor space on the second floor. The cellar will hold church meeting rooms, management offices, bike storage for 108 bicycles and building systems. No retail is planned for the 24,000-square-foot parcel.\n\nOn its\nwebsite\n, the developer refers to the project as \u201cThe Tabernacle.\u201d Though the address differs slightly from project filings, the development is billed as a 205-unit, 11-story, all-affordable housing project that will also include social services for residents.\nHaussmann did not immediately respond to a request for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nJamaica has been a prime Queens neighborhood for development, ranking fourth in the borough for major projects. In the past two years, it logged 1.9 million square feet of commercial and multifamily construction.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The property now consists of three vacant lots, as well as a pair of two-story apartment buildings with 16 units, combined, completed in 1945 and 1954.\nShani Heskiel of Beachfront Realty represented the seller, and Bobby Berrido of Fausto Commercial represented the buyer.\nConstruction of The Aurelian is expected to start early next year, the release says.\n\nEmpira\n\u2013\u2013 led by Rafael Aregger, Branko Kuzmanovi\u0107 and Michael Marrero \u2013\u2013 has largely focused on private equity and debt investment in residential real estate in German-speaking parts of Europe. It invests on behalf of German pension funds, insurance firms and banks.\nIt\u2019s been ramping up its Miami-Dade development pipeline since first entering the market in 2022 with the\n$9 million\npurchase of a half-acre development site in The Roads neighborhood of Miami. Empira is developing the eight-story, 85-unit Enso multifamily project on the site at 3025 and 3051 Southwest Third Avenue.\nLast year, Empira, which is based in Zug, Switzerland, opened its\nU.S. headquarters\nin downtown Miami.\nIn May, Empira scored a\n$111.3 million\nconstruction loan for the 26-story, 310-unit Perrin apartment tower at 244 Southwest Ninth Street in Miami\u2019s Brickell. The firm had paid\n$21.5 million\nfor the 1-acre development site in 2023.\nRecords show construction of the Perrin started in June.\nA few residential projects are on tap in\nCoral Gables\n.\nShoma Group, led by married couple Masoud and Stephanie Shojaee, plans the 16-story, 201-unit\nPonce 8\napartment building, marking the first Live Local Act project in the city. The state law, approved in 2023 and tweaked in the subsequent two years, allows bigger projects than a site\u2019s zoning permits as long as developers designate at least 40 percent of the units for households earning no more than 120 percent of the area median income.\nIn June, Edgardo Defortuna\u2019s Fortune International Group paid\n$37.5 million\nfor the 4.8-acre Coral Gables redevelopment site at 6100 Caballero Boulevard. Fortune plans a $150 million branded condominium project with 251 units.\n",

It had been in the works for more than a decade before Ohtani signed on to an endorsement deal in 2023.\nHayes and Matsumoto claim they were pushed out of the deal after Ohtani and Balelo were brought in.\nBalelo allegedly sought assurances from developer Kevin J. Hayes Sr. and real estate broker Tomoko Matsumoto before demanding their business partner, Las Vegas-based Kingsbarn Realty Capital, remove Hayes and Matsumoto from the deal. The suit claims that Ohtani and Balelo interfered with the contractual rights of Hayes and Matsumoto while they were planning and developing the real estate project.\n\n\u201cThis case is about abuse of power,\u201d the suit says, according to USA Today. \u201c[Ohtani and Balelo] used threats and baseless legal claims to force a business partner to betray its contractual obligations and strip [Hayes and Matsumoto] of the very project they conceived and built. [Ohtani and Balelo] must be held accountable for their actions, not shielded by fame or behind-the-scenes agents acting with impunity.\u201d\nIn response, Kingsbarn Realty called the allegations against Ohtani and Balelo \u201ccompletely frivolous and without merit\u201d in a statement.\n\u201cKingsbarn takes full responsibility for its actions regarding Kevin Hayes and for removing Tomoko Matsumoto as the project\u2019s broker,\u201d the firm said. \u201cThe Mauna Kea project is world-class, and we look forward to welcoming our final group.\u201d\nLast year, Ohtani declared he would be the first resident on the property.

Harris County alone accounts for 526 of those \u2014 more than five times the number it received in the original Opportunity Zone rollout in 2017.\nTexas is projected to have nearly 2,500 eligible census tracts, second only to California, which has about 2,750.

The project is intended to emulate some of uppercrust America\u2019s favorite shopping destinations, including Palm Beach\u2019s Worth Avenue and Greenwich, Connecticut\u2019s Greenwich Avenue, according to the developer\u2019s website.\nThe Village of Wellington\u2019s Planning, Zoning and Adjustment Board\npreviously greenlit the zoning changes\nat a May meeting.\n\nThe developer, Bellissimo\u2019s Wellington Lifestyle Partners (WLP), is a partnership between Wellington Equestrian Partners and Nexus Luxury Collection. Backers include Justin Timberlake, Tiger Woods, and billionaire\nJoe Lewis\u2019\nTavistock Group.\nBellissimo and his partners own a sprawling portfolio in Wellington, including the private Wanderers Club and Wellington International, the showgrounds that host the village\u2019s Winter Equestrian Festival.\nBellissimo\nwon a controversial approval\nfor the Wellington last year, which involved transferring 96 acres out of the village\u2019s 9,000-acre Equestrian Preserve as well as a threat to shutter the showgrounds. The Wellington is slated to include 253 homes, an 18-hole golf course and to be completed in 2028, according to the developer\u2019s website. Bellissimo will also expand and update Wellington International, as part of the agreement with the village.\nWLP still needs to receive final approval for the Marketplace. It will also contend with a similar mixed-use development from Steve Ross\u2019 Related Ross, which reached an agreement in January to buy a 70-acre site known as K-Park from the village for $47 million, the\nPalm Beach Post\nreported. It is planning a restaurant and retail district with a 180-key hotel and 500 residential units, akin to its West Palm Beach mixed-use development CityPlace.",

        "content": "Playboy will take its ongoing makeover from Los Angeles to Miami Beach, as the iconic, yet diminished brand is moving its headquarters to Robert Rivani\u2019s office building.\nPLBY Group, the\nLos Angeles\n-based publicly traded company that owns Playboy magazine, its website and its trademarks, is moving its 300-employee operation into a 20,000-square-foot penthouse office suite at the Rivani, a seven-story mixed-use building at 1691 Washington Avenue that is currently undergoing a $100 million renovation, a press release states.\nPlayboy signed a 10-year lease with a corporate guarantee, a spokesperson for\nRivani\nsaid.\u00a0 Tony Jones with Cushman Wakefield represented Playboy, and Jeremy Hakala with Newmark represented the landlord. The new star tenant is expected to move in next year when the renovations are completed, the spokesperson said.\nRivani, founder of Miami-based Black Lion, bought a ground lease as well as the building, formerly known as The Lincoln, for\n$62.5 million\nlast year. The land underneath is owned by the city of Miami Beach. Black Lion recently changed its name to Rivani, the release states.\n\nAs part of the move to\nMiami Beach\n, Playboy is also planning a content studio for its online creator network and a new members-only Playboy Club in Miami Beach \u201cwith a leading hospitality company,\u201d\u00a0 the release states. Playboy did not comment on the name of its members-only club partner. The facility would feature a restaurant and a members-only space inspired by the Playboy Mansion, the former Los Angeles home of the brand\u2019s late founder and longtime editor-in-chief Hugh Hefner, who died in 2017.\nSince before Hefner\u2019s death, Playboy has been in decline, a reflection of the overall decimation of the print magazine industry. PLBY Group ceased production of the monthly men\u2019s lifestyle magazine, while the company has struggled to keep up with online competition from other adult content companies and streaming platforms such as OnlyFans. In February, Playboy published an annual edition of the magazine.\nA majority of Playboy\u2019s revenue is derived from brand licensing. In the second quarter, PLBY Group reported $28.1 million in total revenue, largely due to a 105 percent increase in licensing revenue, an earnings report states.\nIn recent months, Rivani has sold portions of its restaurant portfolio. In May, the firm sold a space at the SLS Lux Brickell leased to Gekk\u00f5, a Japanese steakhouse owned by musician Bad Bunny and Miami Beach-based hospitality mogul David Grutman, and a space at Dua Miami Hotel leased to Mexican restaurant RosaNegra Miami. The combined sale price was\n$38.2 million\n.\nIn January, Rivani sold a commercial building in Miami Beach\u2019s South of Fifth neighborhood for\n$28.2 million\n. That property is leased to seafood restaurant Catch.",

Gavin Newsom\u2019s signing of two bills limiting the California Environmental Quality Act last month will make it easier for developers to build high-density housing in communities like Los Gatos, the Mercury New\nreported\n.\nAssembly Bill 130 exempts housing-rich infill developments smaller than 20 acres or builder\u2019s remedy projects under 5 acres from CEQA analysis, while Senate Bill 131 protects any rezoning required by a municipality\u2019s Housing Element from CEQA analysis.\nUnder Los Gatos\u2019 Housing Element, certified by the California Department of Housing and Community Development in July of last year, the South Bay town must build about 2,000 new housing units by the beginning of 2032.\nThe town is\nprocessing\n11 builder\u2019s remedy applications, with projects like the Capri Fruitstand, the proposed housing redevelopment of an Ace Hardware location, and the Oswalt Building positioned to receive CEQA exemptions as a result of the new laws.\nThe Walnut Orchard project on the north end of town, for example, is a builder\u2019s remedy project that would be expedited under the new laws. The proposed development would create 138 townhomes including 28 affordable housing units.\n\n\u201cInstead of spending six months, it\u2019ll take me four months to create my application,\u201d Erik Hayden, manager of the real estate equity fund Urban Catalyst behind the project, told the outlet. Previously, it would\u2019ve taken six months for the city to process the application and then a year for the CEQA process, he said.\nThe legislation will also save developers money, as they have to foot the bill for CEQA analysis. Hayden said developers can fork over as much as $1 million for the process to create an environmental impact report.\nAbout 75 percent of Los Gatos has a low vulnerability to pollution sources like ozone, particulate matter, toxic release, hazardous waste, groundwater threats and solid waste sites, the outlet said. No neighborhoods in the town are ill-equipped to respond to disasters, and there\u2019s no anticipation that housing development would constrain the provision of public services like water, sewer and storm drains.\n\u201cLos Gatos almost uniformly had the lowest possible scores according to the CalEnviroScreen metric for 2021, meaning the town has more positive environmental factors,\u201d the\nHousing Element\nstated.\nThe town is\non the hook\nfor 1,993 new housing units by the end of 2031.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The ruling included paying the judgement with interest as well as the attorney fees for Massa, a local dentist and owner of Massa Properties, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n.\nMassa accused Herrero of negligence and breach of contract over a 2022 office building deal in Lufkin that Herrero brokered for Massa. Attorneys said the transaction was handled in a \u201cdeceptive\u201d manner.\nA Bexar County judge found that Herrero failed to disclose that he also represented the seller in the deal and falsified a lease renewal document that compelled Massa to pay $3.34 million for the building.\nThe Texas Facilities Commission, a state agency that is responsible for managing and maintaining state facilities, holds the lease on the 10,000 square foot space in Lufkin.\n\nThis is the latest lawsuit against Herrero in his business dealings, and the second ruling this summer resulting in a default judgement for him to pay.\nVantage Bank won a $1 million judgement for an unpaid loan balance tied to a Grand Prairie office acquisition in June.\nThree CommonWealth Coffeehouse properties went up for auction at the beginning of the year as a result of a default on a $448,000 loan taken out through the First National Bank of Sonora in 2023. The properties are all in San Antonio: a shop at 118 Davis Court, a residence at 122 Davis Court, and a multifamily property called the Cottages on Grayson, at 930 East Grayson Street.\nThe CommonWealth Coffee ownership entity has additional loans totaling more than $1.75 million. The Texas Real Estate Commission\u2019s database shows no active or inactive broker or sales agent license under Herrero\u2019s name.\nThe auctions have not stopped the coffee shop\u2019s expansion in San Antonio. The company still operates a two story location at 203 East Jones Avenue just off Broadway in the former location of Rosella\u2019s, as well as locations in Alamo Heights, Hemisfair and\nWeston\n, and the company plans to open a location in Stone Oak this summer.\u00a0\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Taic\u2019s entity owns\nZ Ocean Hotel\n, which consists of the common areas, a ground-floor cafe, a parking deck and 22 units at the 88-key condo-hotel at 1437 Collins Avenue. The remaining units, of which 51 are managed by Sonesta Hotels, are owned by individuals and entities not affiliated with Taic, records show.\nFive days after Taic filed,\nWells Fargo\n, as trustee for a commercial mortgage-backed securities trust, filed a foreclosure complaint against Taic\u2019s entity, alleging it defaulted on a $12.2 million mortgage issued in 2019. Taic\u2019s entity allegedly failed to maintain adequate insurance coverage, failed to pay property taxes on time, failed to make monthly payments since April and other alleged breaches of the mortgage, the Wells Fargo complaint states. The bank is seeking a court-appointed receiver to take over management of Taic\u2019s entity.\nDavid Geller, the lawyer for Taic\u2019s entity, and Merrick Gross, the attorney for Wells Fargo, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn its complaint, Taic\u2019s entity accused Wells Fargo of violating federal law against deceptive and unfair trade practices by allegedly engaging in a predatory lending scheme designed to block Z Ocean Hotel\u2019s owner from being in compliance with the loan terms.\nWells Fargo did so with the \u201cultimate goal of foreclosing and taking [Z Ocean Hotel,]\u201d according to the complaint.\u00a0 Specifically, Wells Fargo played hardball when Taic\u2019s entity had trouble securing insurance for\nZ Ocean Hotel\n, the lawsuit alleges. The bank allegedly refused to provide a waiver when Taic\u2019s entity was unable to secure a new policy for the hotel due to \u201cextremely difficult and unreasonable market forces.\u201d\nWells Fargo allegedly obtained an insurance policy for Z Ocean Hotel, paying for it by withdrawing more than $800,000 from the Taic entity\u2019s mortgage escrow account, the lawsuit alleges. When Taic\u2019s entity sought proof of the insurance policy\u2019s cost, the loan servicer allegedly refused. Wells Fargo subsequently placed back $1 million into the escrow account in July with no explanation, Taic\u2019s entity alleges.\nMeanwhile, Taic\u2019s entity is fending off another foreclosure complaint. In July, Z-Hotel Holdings sued Taic\u2019s entity, alleging that it defaulted on a $4.9 million mortgage. That lender claims that it holds first position over the Wells Fargo loan, the Z-Hotel Holdings complaint states.\nIn 2020, after a seven-year legal fight, Taic won a $8.2 million judgment against the developers of Z Ocean Hotel who sold him their ownership interest in Z Ocean Hotel. Two years later, the sellers lost an appeal.\nTaic\nalleged that the developers \u2014 Gene Grabarnick, Pauline Grabarnick, Garett Grabarnick and Ronald Molko \u2013 misrepresented the financial viability of the condo-hotel project when he bought a majority interest in Z Ocean Hotel in 2008.",

        "content": "A family saga is one step closer to a finale. Mark Harounian notched a win in his legal battle with the sister who sued him a decade ago.\nMehrnaz Homapour claimed her brother duped her into signing agreements that let him enrich himself off family real estate companies. But a state judge Monday said she failed to demonstrate fraud, deciding several claims in her brother\u2019s favor.\nThe case, which is headed to trial, provides a look into how disputes arise in families where money is plentiful and agreements are informal.\nMark Harounian is the son of Jacob Harounian, the Iranian investor who made money in the Persian rug business before turning to Manhattan real estate. Mark\u2019s sisters are minority members in family LLCs that Mark manages.\nHomapour claimed her brother took funds from the companies to support his own investments, as well as allegedly pay for an \u201coutrageously lavish\u201d lifestyle of luxury cars, famous art and \u201cjewelry and rent-free apartments for his mistresses.\u201d\nAnd when her brother asked her to sign documents related to the family business, he told her there was nothing new in the paperwork, Homapour claimed. Instead, those agreements allowed Harounian to compensate himself for his work as manager.\nHomapour argued this was fraud. But a judge said that claim doesn\u2019t hold up when Homapour admits she didn\u2019t read or inquire about what she was signing.\n\n\u201cThis is putting to bed the scandalous and unsupported claims of fraud and clearing Mark Harounian\u2019s good name,\u201d said Todd Soloway, an attorney for Harounian.\nThe judge similarly dismissed other efforts by Homapour to get a quick decision to set up a trust for the assets and get her brother removed as a member of the LLCs.\nThe case will now be sent to trial, where the parties will argue over whether Harounian\u2019s compensation from the companies was reasonable.\nAttorneys for Homapour said they were pleased the court is bringing those claims about the compensation to trial and also ordered Harounian to give a full accounting of company finances.\n\u201cThis decision is another significantly positive step towards our client ultimately recovering the tens of millions of dollars Mark wrongfully took from the family companies,\u201d Homapour\u2019s attorneys, Terrence Oved, Darren Oved and Glen Lenihan at Oved &amp; Oved LLP, said in a statement.\nThe case is just one battle in the family\u2019s civil war. Patriarch Jacob Harounian has sued Mark for similar claims in a case that is still ongoing. A company Mark manages won its own case against Jacob in 2023, claiming that he wired himself $5 million from a company account.\n",

        "content": "Overall, there were 253 deals, totaling about $475 million, recorded in New York City on Wednesday, Aug. 13.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Residential:\nCentral Park Tower at\n217 West 57th Street\nin Midtown notched the highest residential sale in New York.\nMatthew Kaulig\n, owner of the NASCAR team Kaulig Racing, and his wife\nLisa Kaulig\ndropped about $17.6 million \u2014 about $5,200 per square foot \u2014\u00a0on a sponsor unit at the Billionaires\u2019 Row tower, which was developed by\nGary Barnett\u2019s Extell Development Company\n. The 3,400-square-foot, three-bedroom unit first hit the market in August of 2022, with an asking price of $22.6 million, but its most recent asking price was $18.9 million. Extell Marketing Group and Corcoran\u2019s\nKane Manera, Janet Wang, Gabriele Tonini\nand\nTim Rizzo\nhad the listing.\n\ud83c\udfc6 Commercial:\nNew York\u2019s top commercial real estate transaction was in Glendale. The Shops at Atlas Park, an open-air shopping center at\n80-00 Cooper Avenue\n, traded for $72 million. The buyer was\nBen Ashkenazy\u2019s Askenazy Acquisition Corp.\n, and the seller was California-based\nMacerich.\nThe property, which is 97 percent leased, spans 370,000 square feet. The deal works out to about $195 per square foot. Macerich had owned the mall since 2011, when the firm purchased it via a foreclosure auction for $54 million.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nIn Bay Ridge, the\nGindi family\u2019s\nsale of the former Century 21 flagship store in Bay Ridge for $47.5 million hit records. The buyer was a joint venture between Baltimore-based\nMCB Real Estate\nand Istanbul-based\nOsiris Ventures.\nThe 14-parcel property spans 95,000 square feet. The deal works out to about $500 per square foot. The buyers plan to redevelop the site into a grocery-anchored shopping center. JLL\u2019s\nEthan Stanton, Jeffrey Julien\nand\nBrendan Maddigan\narranged the deal.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nA company managed by\nKim Soonbin\noffloaded a 36-unit apartment complex at\n331 Keap Street\nin East Williamsburg. The buyer, an LLC tied to\nJanusz Sendowski\n, paid just over $9 million for the nearly 22,000-square-foot, six-story building. The seller bought the property about six years ago for $15.5 million. The latest deal marks a nearly 42 percent loss.\n\ud83d\udcca Residential: Michael and Kelly Kong\npaid $9.8 million for a townhouse at\n37 West 74th Street\non the Upper West Side. The seller,\nKensington Investments Limited\n, had owned the building for decades.

The buyers were\nBrian Davis\n, a financial executive, and\nCayla O\u2019Connell Davis\n, a fashion entrepreneur, who paid just under $9 million for the pad. The Apples purchased the unit in 2013 for about $7.8 million, then listed it for sale in January for $9.5 million. Sotheby\u2019s International Realty\u2019s\nAmanda Cannon Goldworm, Megan Duryea Scott, Merrill Curtis\nand\nGeoff McKernan\nrepresented the sellers.\nBy the Numbers:\nMiami ranks No. 1 for super-rich second homeowners \u2014 but New York boasts most ultra-wealthy homeowners\nMiami is the No. 1 spot \u2014 on the planet \u2014 for the super-rich to purchase second homes, according to a report from Altrata, a data provider for the wealth industry.\nMore than 13,200 ultra-high-net-worth people, or those with a net worth of more than $30 million, have second properties in Miami. That\u2019s about three-fourths of Miami\u2019s ultra-high-net-worth population \u2014 the greatest share of the top 20 cities.\nThe city with the most super-wealthy homeowners is New York, which has more than 33,200 owners in that category.

        "content": "New York has a long, drawn-out process for foreclosing on homes.\nThat is by design: Homeowners are given time because the loss of their primary residence can be catastrophic and is often avoidable. Residential foreclosures shouldn\u2019t be rushed.\nIn contrast, non-judicial UCC foreclosures are fast \u2014 60 days, and notices are limited. The process is intended for commercial properties, whose owners are sophisticated enough to deal with it.\nUnfortunately, it also applies to co-op shares owned by regular people.\nLet\u2019s say Mrs. Smith suffers from dementia, forgets to pay her monthly maintenance charges for a while and stops reading her mail. The co-op board can foreclose on her shares and sell the unit at an auction on the courthouse steps.\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for clueless owners to show up and ask the auctioneer what\u2019s going on, only to be told their home is being sold by the board \u2014 even though its market value far exceeds the unpaid dues. Some real estate professionals are regulars at these auctions, looking to buy co-op units for a fraction of their market value, as my colleague Keith Larsen has\nwritten\n.\nSometimes the buyer is the co-op board itself, hoping to recoup the arrears (and then some) by buying and reselling the unit.\nWe have even heard of situations where the winning bidder is rejected by the co-op board, forcing another auction to be held. The board keeps rejecting winners until it becomes the sole bidder. It\u2019s unclear how often this happens, but it\u2019s said to be common at some buildings. Even one instance is too many.\nProblems with UCC foreclosures on co-ops do not appear to be on politicians\u2019 radar. An ideal system would balance the interests of co-op boards, delinquent shareholders and buyers.\nA protracted, bureaucratic process would be unfair to boards trying to collect maintenance fees, but neither should people lose their homes in 60 days because they owe a modest amount of money and didn\u2019t realize what was happening.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat reform would you suggest for dealing with unpaid co-op dues? Should a guardian be appointed for the homeowner, allowing for a home equity loan or traditional sale that would pay the arrears and put any excess in the seller\u2019s pocket? Or could a cure be worse than the problem?\nSend your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Labyrinth, a company focused on streamlining permitting, came up with a \u201c\nred tape index\n\u201d to measure how efficiently states and localities process building permits, zoning changes and related approvals.\n\nNot coincidentally, the worst performers were the states with the most expensive housing markets.\nMassachusetts was 45th, followed by Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, California and the absolute worst, Hawaii.\nTennessee claimed the best score, followed by Florida, Texas, Indiana and Arizona.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 A developer of Pacific Park wasn\u2019t fined by New York state for missing key deadlines because the firm threatened to sue, according to\nGothamist\n. Greenland USA would have faced more than $1.75 million in monthly penalties after failing to complete 876 units of affordable housing by the\nMay 31 deadline\n. Greenland cited \u201cunavoidable delays.\u201d The decks over the rail yard that were supposed to support the new housing have\nyet to be built\n.\n\u2014 The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated five Garment District buildings as historical landmarks ahead of Thursday\u2019s vote on the Midtown South rezoning,\namNY\nreported. If the City Council signs off on the designation, any future changes to the exterior or structure of the buildings would need to be approved by the LPC.\n\u2014 City officials published a new master plan for New York\u2019s greenways,\nGothamist\nreported. The plan aims to connect more of the city\u2019s existing greenways and includes 40 miles of new paths.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$9.8 million\nfor a 6,576-square-foot townhouse at 37 West 74th Street on the Upper West Side. Roberta Golubock of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial sale recorded was for five properties in Bay Ridge by ASG Equities to MCB Real Estate and Osiris Ventures for $43.6 million.\nThe Real Deal\nreported the deal Aug. 5.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$25 million\nfor a 4,089-square-foot condominium unit in The Cortland at 555 West 22nd Street in Chelsea. Shaun Osher of Core NYC has\nthe listing\n.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for a proposed 391,830-square-foot, 387-unit residential building at 23-07 43 Avenue in Long Island City. Handel Architects filed the permit on behalf of William Xu of Grand Construction and Development.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "Su-Mei Yen couldn\u2019t dig herself out of distress at her big South Loop hotel development in time to avoid her lender\u2019s wrath, according to a recent lawsuit.\nSan Francisco-based lender ACORE Capital filed a $187 million foreclosure complaint against the owners of 1100 South Michigan and 1101 South Wabash Avenues, including the Yen family\u2019s firm, Hinsdale-based SB Yen, which also employs the longtime Chicago hotelier\u2019s relatives Bert and Cassie.\nThe lender\u2019s foreclosure lawsuit threatens to strip the landlords of their control of the lodging property, which includes the 172-room Best Western Hotel on Michigan Avenue they renovated in recent years as well as the Homewood Suites by Hilton on Wabash Avenue, which consists of 196 hotel rooms, and a separate 85-room extended stay suites section plus ground-floor retail they built in 2018.\nThe Yens poured at least $3.7 million into extending the loan\u2019s maturity date, which originally was set to come due in 2022, when the aftermath of the pandemic was still weighing heavily on the travel and lodging industries.\nMeanwhile, investors hailing from China say they collectively raised more than $18 million for real estate projects backed by SB Yen, including the South Loop developments, but Yen and her children allegedly mismanaged the money. The funds were raised through the federal EB-5 program that allows foreigners to obtain U.S. visas in exchange for investments in real estate projects, but some of the investors say they never gained permanent residency due to SB Yen\u2019s financial missteps. Their lawsuit against Yen expanded in recent months from three plaintiffs who had put $1.5 million into SB Yen to now more than three dozen who each contributed at least $550,000.\nThe funds were meant to go into renovating the Best Western Grant Park Hotel at 1100 South Michigan and developing the newer, neighboring 30-story mixed-use tower at 1101 South Wabash.\nThey claim a conflict of interest arose due to Cassie Yen controlling the EB-5 lender vehicle while her mother Su-Mei Yen controlled the borrower entities. The investors allege the Yens \u201centered into an agreement to misappropriate funds from the company, to intentionally allow the loan to default, and to intentionally conceal the loan\u2019s status\u201d from the investors, their lawsuit said.\nSu-Mei Yen and an attorney for SB Yen didn\u2019t return requests for comment. An attorney for Lotus declined to comment, and representatives of ACORE didn\u2019t return requests for comment on how the EB-5 investors\u2019 lawsuit may impact the foreclosure proceedings.\n\nEven though the investors and ACORE are seeking a total of over $202 million from the Yens \u2014 who have owned and operated Chicago hotels for decades \u2014 their Gold Coast and Evanston properties have so far wiggled out of precarious financial situations in the post-pandemic era.\nAfter a brush with a previous lender in 2022, their 97-year-old Whitehall Hotel on the Gold Coast, at 105 East Delaware Place, is carrying a $50 million loan that so far remains intact, but is set to mature later this year, according to public records. Su-Mei Yen has owned the Whitehall since 1992. Her 259-room Evanston property, at 1501 Sherman Avenue, earlier this year also had its mortgage expanded by 30 percent to a total principal amount of $13 million, public records show.\nYen also got a New York judge to dismiss her as an individual from a lawsuit filed by a debt restructuring firm, Lotus Capital, that negotiated a loan extension on the ACORE deal for the South Loop properties. Her firm SB Yen in March settled with Lotus, though the terms weren\u2019t disclosed, after the brokerage claimed it wasn\u2019t paid its $700,000 fee for its services for the hotel firm.\nBut ACORE is now alleging that after it granted forbearance to SB Yen for its loan three times, in 2020, 2021 and and again in 2024 ahead of its September 2024 maturity date, the borrower has violated its agreements with the lender by failing to deposit hotel revenue in recent months.\nThe lender claims the account that SB Yen is supposed to fund with the South Loop hotel revenues is \u201csignificantly short,\u201d including by about $2 million during peak summer months.\n\u201cMoreover, borrower has admitted to [ACORE] that, instead of remitting revenues to the clearing account, these amounts have been used to repay cash fundings from borrower\u2019s affiliates,\u201d the lender said in its suit.\nThe complaint also alleges SB Yen agreed to pay a forbearance fee of $600,000 in June 2024 but never coughed up the money, constituting yet another event of default.\nDue to interest and fees, the unpaid balance on the debt has swelled to over $187 million despite being originated for just $146 million in 2019, with over $60,000 being added to the loan each day it remains in default, the lawsuit said.",

That amounts to $436,590 per unit. Newmark brokers Elizabeth Gagliardi, Chuck Johanns and Susan Lawson are marketing the 49-story building, called the Streeter.\nThe asking price wasn\u2019t disclosed. STRS Ohio\u2019s portfolio encompasses a range of\nproperties\n, including retail and multifamily.\nRents are rising among downtown Chicago apartment buildings, up 6.25 percent year-over-year in the first quarter, according to Integra Realty Resources. Inflationary pressures in construction costs and high interest rates have dampened apartment starts downtown, contributing to a 30-year low on apartment deliveries and increased demand for space in the older units.\nLocal developer Golub partnered with AEW Capital Partners and BlackRock Realty Advisors in 2006 to build the Streeter. The building is 99 percent occupied and rent averages $3,749 per month, about $3.96 per square foot, according to CoStar.\n\nNearby listings include Miami-based Crescent Heights\u2019 398-unit North Water Apartments, at 340 East North Water Street in Streeterville, which hit the market in April. Crescent Heights\npurchased\nthe multifamily component of the building in June 2023 for $173 million ($435,000 per unit), a bargain compared to its $240 million trade in 2016. That property was listed as 93 percent occupied with similar average rents of $3,574 per unit or $3.93 per square foot, according to marketing materials.\nThe Chicago suburbs especially are attracting multifamily investors, with transactions jumping\n65 percent year-over-year\nin March, according to Interra Realty.\nMajor transactions this year include\nMoceri &amp; Roszak\u2019s sale\nof the 375-unit Fulbrix Apartments in Fulton Market for $170 million, or $453,333 per unit, marking the city\u2019s largest apartment sale in nearly two years.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Renovation is underway for an aging Oak Cliff apartment complex that was at the center of a bribery case.\nNew York-based Fairstead purchased the 168-unit Royal Crest Apartments at 3558 Wilhurt Avenue. Fairstead secured a $33 million renovation loan from Capital One, according to county records, amounting to almost $198,000 per unit. Fairstead stated that total rehabilitation costs will be about $24 million, or $142,857 per unit.\nThe seller is AmeriSouth Realty Group, owned by Ruel Hamilton, a local developer\nrecently acquitted of bribery\nin a retrial. Hamilton was previously convicted of bribing a Dallas City Council member between 2013 and 2015 to gain support for a renovation of Royal Crest.\nThe Section 8 subsidized housing development was built in 1969 and hasn\u2019t undergone a substantial renovation in five decades, according to Fairstead. The renovations will include energy efficiency features, a computer lab, a children\u2019s play area and an improved laundry facility. The renovated community center will also offer career training, financial literacy courses and after-school programming for K-12 students.\n\nFairstead\u2019s portfolio spans 28 states and includes over a thousand units in Texas, but this project is the company\u2019s first Texas rehabilitation, according to a news release. Renovation began this month and is expected to wrap up in fall of 2026.\nMore development is expected\nin West Oak Cliff\nafter the Dallas City Council voted on Wednesday to rezone 35 acres for residential and mixed-use development. Proponents said rezoning will encourage development of vacant lots, but opponents said rezoning could price out current residents.\nAnother affordable housing development is planned for a\nWest Oak Cliff church site\n. Generation Partners is demolishing the former Templo de Alabanza church at 4710 West Illinois Avenue to make way for a 22-unit development that will offer services similar to Fairstead\u2019s at Royal Crest, including financial literacy programs and free tax preparation.\nOther recent trades in Oak Cliff include 1235 Hartsdale Drive, a 94-unit multifamily property purchased by syndicators Cody Gustafson and Robert Slattery last month.\n",

There is already space for four simultaneous productions, SGS Studios co-founder David Glasser told the outlet.\n\u201cIt will be something that hasn\u2019t been done in Texas before,\u201d Glasser said. Glasser is also the CEO of 101 Studios.\n\nTwo buildings spanning 450,000 square feet have already been built, and some scenes for Sheridan\u2019s show \u201cLandman\u201d were filmed there. Hillwood\u2019s conversion of the two buildings to studio space was estimated to cost $65 million, or $144 per square foot.\nThe Texas incentives are expected to boost the local film industry in an effort to compete with Los Angeles and Georgia. SGS Studios and 101 Studios are reportedly working with a local community college to train students for film jobs.\nIn recent years film studios have been announced elsewhere in Texas, including\nHill Country Studios\nin San Marcos, a 209-acre project announced in 2023 and led by Cory McLoud and Netflix studios veteran Kevin Bar. Los Angeles-based Creative Tank\u2019s Super Studios in Mansfield is slated to include 400,000 square feet of sound stages as well as hotel, retail and residential components.\nBastrop 552\n, a 456-acre, $50 million studio is proposed by developer Alton Butler. And the $100 million\nWyldwood Studios\nis also planned for Bastrop by actor Zachary Levi.\nMeanwhile, Los Angeles is losing ground in the industry. On-location filming in Los Angeles fell 22 percent in the first quarter year-over-year, with soundstage occupancy dropping to 63 percent, according to FilmLA.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The property sold for $1 million in 1984, $375,000 in 1977 and $235,000 in 1971.\nThe three-story manse, built in 1927, sits in a 2.2-acre lot and spans 7,245 square feet with four bedrooms and four full bathrooms. The home also features a four-car garage and views of the Pacific Ocean and Pebble Beach Golf Links.\nOther big-ticket transactions in the county this year include a Carmel Highlands estate that\nsold\nin June for $14.8 million, a property in Carmel that sold for $15.5 million that same month and another Carmel estate in April that traded hands for $17.5 million.\n\nThe median listing home price in Pebble Beach as of June was $3.5 million, representing an 8 percent drop year-over-year, according to the Business Journal. The median sale price was $2.8 million with homes spending about 10 weeks on the market.\nPebble Beach ranks above the exclusive Carmel-by-the-Sea enclave where the median listing price is $3 million.

Across the county, listings averaged about $1.3 million in June; by contrast, the median listing price in Santa Clara County, the capital of Silicon Valley, was $1.5 million in June. Sales there closed at a median price of $1.7 million.\nElsewhere in Pebble Beach, other high-end properties are on the market including a four-bedroom for $13.3 million, a five-bedroom for $15 million and an eight-bedroom estate for $29 million, per the Business Journal.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "The Manhattan rental market is hotter than ever. Again.\nThe median rent for a brokered Manhattan apartment reached $4,700 in July, a 9.3 percent change from a year earlier, according to the newest report from Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel. It\u2019s a new record for the borough, the fifth in the last six months.\nThe record prices come amid a mayoral race that has been notably focused on housing affordability. Frontrunners Zohran Mamdani and Andrew Cuomo blast each other not only on their housing plans but also on their\npersonal living situations\n, no reprieve from high rents is expected to turn voters\u2019 attentions elsewhere.\n\u201cEven if rents stop their ascent, there certainly won\u2019t be a quick pivot to affordability,\u201d said Jonathan Miller, author of the report.\nThe record prices began in February, unusual timing for the city where rents peak in summer. But mortgage rates have put pressure on the sales market, prompting some would-be buyers to wait it out in the rental market, Miller said. Interest rate cuts, which Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called for this week, could relieve some of that pressure.\nBut elevated demand is also carrying the market to record highs. At Fetner Properties, which advertises luxury high-rise buildings, leadership estimates they\u2019ve raised rents an average of 5 or 6 percent across the portfolio in the past year while also updating amenity packages.\n\n\u201cThe rents are spectacular,\u201d said Hal Fetner, president and CEO. \u201cThere\u2019s just not a lot of new supply coming into the market and then there\u2019s an insatiable demand of professionals who are continuing to look for units.\u201d\nManhattan, Brooklyn and Northwest Queens all saw record highs in the share of apartments subject to bidding wars, 29 percent in Manhattan, 36 percent in Brooklyn, and 27 percent in Queens.\nIn Manhattan, the rise in prices is primarily driven by studios and one-bedrooms, Miller said. The vacancy rate in the borough was 2.45 percent. Apartments were on the market for an average of 28 days, down from 32 last July.\nThe FARE Act, which went into effect in June, is also likely to be pushing up rents, at least slightly. The law prohibits brokers from charging fees to tenants who didn\u2019t hire them. If landlords pay for brokers themselves, they\u2019re likely to try to recoup that cost through higher prices.\nMedian rent in Brooklyn rose to the second-highest on record, at $3,850 for a brokered apartment. That was a 7 percent change from last July. Listing inventory fell 7 percent year over year.\nIn Northwest Queens, which includes Astoria, Long Island City, Sunnyside and Woodside, median rent was $3,750, a nearly 9 percent increase year-over-year.\n",

But developers must meet four conditions addressing accessibility, lighting, building materials and environmental concerns in order to move forward.\nCommissioners instructed the development team, composed of applicant Rusnak/Pasadena and architect Goree Whitfield, to revise the Colorado Boulevard frontage to ensure people of all abilities can enter the plaza via the same path, thereby eliminating a separate accessible route.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a much more elegant solution where you don\u2019t actually separate people with different abilities,\u201d Commissioner Srinivas Rao said, per Pasadena Now.\nCity zoning rules restricting upward-facing lighting also require the developer to create a glare-reducing lighting plan for the sides and rear of the building. \u201cThe zoning code does have requirements for shielding and downlight,\u201d Pasadena Principal Planner Kevin Johnson pointed out.\n\nIn addition, the team will have to lighten the color of the brick used on large wall areas to prevent a uniform monolithic exterior and to create contrast with the aluminum composite panels on the building. Officials said the current plan for dark brick might be an eyesore to pedestrians and took away from the visual warmth common in Pasadena.\nThe team will also have to adhere to the tweaked plans for the ground of the plaza. The applicant proposed using\u00a0 artificial turf \u201cpods\u201d beneath the public art installation in place of previously proposed \u201cturf block\u201d plantings due to maintenance issues under parked cars.\nPlanning Commission Chair Julianna Delgado wants the team to steer clear of synthetic turf entirely, citing its fossil fuel origins, heat-island effects and water-use implications. The commission is requiring a sustainability review of the proposed material and comparison with greener alternatives in order to advance.\nThe historic Swanson &amp; Peterson Furniture Factory building on the new site is not eligible for historic designation, according to city staff. While the owner plans to keep the structure, any major alterations would trigger additional design review by the city.\nNow that the dealership design has been approved, the project will have to secure building permits and a plan check, whereby officials verify compliance with both interdepartmental and commission-imposed conditions.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "New York State decided not to collect millions in fines from Greenland USA for blowing past affordable housing deadlines at the long-delayed Atlantic Yards redevelopment after the developer threatened to sue if the state tried.\nThe Chinese firm was supposed to deliver nearly 900 affordable units by the end of May under a 2014 settlement, or face $1.75 million in monthly penalties \u2014 $2,000 per incomplete unit. But 11 years later, Greenland hasn\u2019t even broken ground on the railyard platform where many of those apartments were planned, Gothamist\nreported\n.\nInstead, Empire State Development officials told a local task force earlier this month that the fines \u2014 earmarked for a city affordable housing trust fund \u2014 won\u2019t accrue and won\u2019t be collected. The fund could have topped $5.25 million by now.\nGreenland, which defaulted on a $350 million investor loan in 2023, has cited \u201cunavoidable delays,\u201d including lack of subsidies and slow MTA approvals, as reasons for missing deadlines. ESD says it disputes those claims but acknowledged the company\u2019s warning that any attempt to collect penalties would trigger litigation and stall the project further.\nFirst pitched in 2003, Atlantic Yards \u2014 rebranded Pacific Park \u2014 was supposed to deliver 2,250 affordable apartments alongside market-rate housing, offices and the Barclays Center. To date, 1,374 affordable units have been built and the railyard platform remains a vacant promise.\n\nThe state expects to approve a transfer of development rights next month to a joint venture involving Cirrus Real Estate Partners,\nLCOR\nand Greenland. The revised plan folds in nearby retail parcels, including a shuttered Modell\u2019s and a P.C. Richard &amp; Son; Greenland will retain partial control despite failing to meet its obligations.\nThe no-fines move has enraged some community leaders, who say the state is bailing out a developer that seized land through eminent domain and then failed to deliver.\nAssemblymember Jo Ann Simon called Greenland\u2019s lawsuit threat \u201coutrageous,\u201d adding, \u201cIf you consider defaulting on your debt as an unavoidable delay, that\u2019s an argument, but it\u2019s a stretch to hang it on ESD.\u201d\nOthers, including former city housing official and consultant Jordan Barowitz, said the threat is an unsurprising developer tactic and that piling on fines could make a financially shaky project even less likely to get built.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",
