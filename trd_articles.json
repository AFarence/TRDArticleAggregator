        "content": "Xin Capital has nabbed a $51 million loan to acquire a fully-leased retail and office assemblage in Times Square.\nWhite Oak Real Estate Capital provided the senior secured loan for the purchase of Times Square West, a 144,500-square-foot property at 303 West 42nd Street and 300 West 43rd Street. The complex includes 17,500 square feet of ground-floor retail and 127,000 square feet of recently renovated office space.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in an extremely strong market, Times Square still being one of the most prominent retail corridors in the country,\u201d said Eric Tanjeloff, Managing Principal at White Oak Real Estate Capital.\nThe financing will bridge Xin Capital through a rent-free buildout period for its newly signed master tenant in the office portion, which will upgrade the space into a yet-to-be-announced global food and beverage entertainment experience. Tanjeloff predicts that when the plans for the space become public, it \u201cwill garner some attention because it is so different\u201d from what currently exists in the city.\nThat lease will bring the property to 100 percent occupancy. \u201cWe think that creates significant value for the owner and obviously support for our loan,\u201d said Tanjeloff.\nCurrent retail tenants include Chick-fil-A, Smashburger, 7-Eleven, Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and Little Italy Pizza, predominantly under long-term leases signed during the pandemic at below-market rent, according to Tanjeloff. Those leases have about 15 years remaining, providing what he called a \u201cstable foundation\u201d for the property\u2019s cash flow.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased with WOREC\u2019s execution on this financing which allowed us to take\nadvantage of what we believe is a once in a lifetime opportunity to buy undervalued assets in\nManhattan,\u201d said Jerry Tang, Founder of Xin Capital, in a statement.\nThe project is an example of how Manhattan\u2019s\nvacant office space\ncan be creatively\nreimagined\nfor more viable uses, Tanjeloff said, citing a past $21.5 million White Oak financing of a conversion to self-storage in Tribeca, hotel conversions and other non-office uses.\nThe deal comes on the heels of White Oaks\u2019 recent $42.2 million senior secured loan to Related Companies for the Village at Tuxedo Reserve and a $27.2 million senior secured loan to 1784 Holdings for a self-storage project in Garden Grove, California.\n",

        "content": "A student housing syndicator is at risk of losing two Chicago buildings, while battling a lender that\u2019s closing in on a separate portfolio of similar properties across the U.S.\nVersity Investments, led by Brian Nelson, has been delinquent on loan payments for The Buckingham and the Tailor Lofts in Chicago for the past two months, according to loan servicer notes compiled by commercial mortgage-backed securities tracker Morningstar Credit.\nVersity bought The Buckingham, a 1920s-era high-rise near Roosevelt University, in 2018 for $73.3 million. The firm funded the purchase with a $45.3 million loan originated by Wells Fargo.\nThe 440-unit tower first ran into trouble in late 2020 when Wells hit Versity with a foreclosure lawsuit, alleging the loan was in default. But within a year, the lender worked out a forbearance agreement with Versity instead of taking back the keys.\nSoon after, Versity hired Newmark to market the property at 59 East Van Buren Street in hopes of cutting its losses. However, the building didn\u2019t sell and Versity failed to make mortgage payments toward the loan in both July and August of this year, according to notes from the PNC Bank-owned loan servicer Midland that were compiled by Morningstar.\nThe payments stopped coming in shortly after Versity settled a contract dispute with a private security company that ended with Versity forking over about $40,000, public records show.\n\nAt the same time, Versity fell behind on payments toward a $38 million loan backed by the Tailor Lofts near The University of Illinois at Chicago. Versity bought the 135-unit student apartment building at 315 South Peoria Street in 2019 for $60 million.\nRepresentatives of Versity did not respond to requests for comment.\nThere\u2019s still time for Versity to forge another comeback, because the loans for the Buckingham and the Tailor Lofts don\u2019t mature until 2028 and 2029, respectively. But they\u2019re not the only properties giving the California-based investment company trouble.\nA year before Versity hashed out a settlement with the private security company at The Buckingham, it was slapped with a much bigger lawsuit. A venture of Knighthead Capital Management\u2019s real estate lending arm is suing Versity in a New York court for breach of contract and fraud, among other claims.\nThe filing claims that the Knighthead venture issued loans to Versity to purchase eight student housing complexes across the U.S. but Versity failed to pay off four of them. The four properties with loans in default are located in Alabama, Texas, Oklahoma and Florida.\nMuch of the filing is redacted but a separate attorney who is pursuing a mass arbitration claim against Versity on behalf of investors claims Knighthead\u2019s litigation unearthed $56 million in misappropriated proceeds from syndicators.\nNelson\u2019s brother and former business partner is also in hot water for similar reasons. The brothers founded Nelson Brothers Real Estate in 2007 but soon went their separate ways. Brian Nelson\u2019s brother\u2019s firm, Nelson Partners, was the subject of a 2021 New York Times report alleging it ripped off investors and failed to properly maintain its properties.",

        "content": "The only completed building at the long-stalled Lincoln Yards megadevelopment is up for sale, underscoring the site\u2019s fractured future as a cast of players steps in with residential plans.\nSterling Bay, along with partners Harrison Street and J.P. Morgan Asset Management, has tapped Eastdil Secured and Savills to market the 284,000-square-foot building at 1229 West Concord Place, CoStar\nreported\n. The eight-story Gensler-designed property was delivered more than two years ago with high-end lab and office space, but it\u2019s entirely vacant.\nThe lender that funded the building, Bank OZK, confirmed to\nThe Real Deal\nthat a loan on the building has a balance of $64.7 million and is in good standing with no write downs. That loan reaches maturity next month.\nThe move marks another twist in the saga of\nLincoln Yards\n, the $6 billion vision Sterling Bay unveiled more than six years ago for 50-plus acres along the North Branch of the Chicago River. The city signed off on zoning that would allow 14.5 million square feet of development and towers topping 500 feet, but little has materialized beyond 1229 West Concord Place. The pandemic, spiking construction and borrowing costs, and heavy infrastructure obligations left the project stalled.\n\nNow, the land is effectively being\nsplit\n. JDL Development and Florida-based Kayne Anderson have agreed to acquire the northern 31 acres from Bank OZK, which seized the site from Sterling Bay\u2019s partner Lone Star Funds. JDL and Kayne are rebranding their portion as Foundry Park, with plans for as many as 3,000 homes spanning single-family, condos and rentals. Meanwhile, the southern portion\u2019s future is murkier, with the Concord building hitting the market and Sterling Bay separately shopping land nearby, including a Kingsbury Street parcel entitled for a\n355-unit\napartment project.\nBrokers are pitching the Concord property as a discount buy relative to replacement cost, with a mix of lab infrastructure and \u201chospitality-caliber\u201d amenities such as a fitness center, outdoor terrace, and riverfront patio. While designed for life sciences, they argue it could easily serve as high-end office space at a time when brand-new inventory is scarce.\nWhether that sales pitch resonates remains to be seen. The building today overlooks empty land, though nearby restaurants, bars and retail are expected once JDL\u2019s residential buildout begins. For now, it stands as a glassy reminder of Sterling Bay\u2019s stalled ambitions \u2014 and a test of whether buyers see value in a trophy building without a neighborhood around it.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "San Antonio\u2019s East Side is set for another injection of density, with a $91 million affordable housing project on deck.\nThe Annex Group and local housing authority Opportunity Home plan to build a 279-unit complex dubbed Central at Commerce at 1231 East Commerce Street, less than a block east of St. Paul Square and downtown, and within walking distance of the Amtrak Station and the Alamodome. Construction is slated to kick off in February, with completion by the end of 2027, the San Antonio Business Journal\nreported\n. The development cost works out to $326,000 per unit.\nThe project will offer one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments with about half of units reserved for tenants earning 70 percent or less of the area median income; 24 percent will be reserved for tenants earning 60 percent AMI; 15 percent will be reserved for tenants earning 30 percent AMI; and 11 percent will be reserved for those earning 50 percent or less of the AMI.\nTo finance the deal, Opportunity Home is pursuing low-income housing tax credits from the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs, with a decision expected in December. The developers are seeking $41 million in tax credits spread over a decade.\n\nOpportunity Home\u2019s board has already authorized the agency to negotiate a memorandum of understanding to become a general partner in the venture, though final terms are still pending. On the city\u2019s side, council has approved $6 million in gap funding from the 2022 affordable housing bond and is expected to sign off on a resolution of no objection for the tax credit application, a procedural step that keeps the financing moving.\nThe project comes as Opportunity Home is\nexpanding\nthrough multiple partnerships. Just north of the proposed East Commerce site, it recently teamed with\nLynd Living\non The Josephine, which is now in lease-up. Central at Commerce would add hundreds more affordable units in a submarket where\nrising land\nand construction costs have strained developers\u2019 ability to deliver income-restricted housing.\nFor the East Side, the plan underscores how long-discussed development momentum is finally materializing, with city-backed affordable housing playing a central role. If the tax credits land as expected, Central at Commerce could become one of the largest affordable multifamily projects in the area in years.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "pub_date_dt": "2025-08-19T09:35:00",
        "content": "The math around the Midtown South rezoning is confusing.\nSpecifically, the adjustments that the City Council made ahead of approving the rezoning underscore just how slippery the housing projections that accompany major zoning changes can be. Were 141 potential housing units lost? Closer to 500? Or 1,000?\nAs part of the environmental review process, the Department of City Planning identifies development sites that are likely to be redeveloped if zoning changes are made, based on a number of factors. That doesn\u2019t mean the agency has received confirmation from the owners of these sites that they will actually take advantage of the rezoning.\nBy the same token, some sites where the owners are keen to redevelop aren\u2019t necessarily included in those projections.\nConsider Expansion Group\u2019s 554-568 Eighth Avenue, a 21-story, vacant office building that was being marketed as a potentially ideal office-to-residential conversion, thanks to the rezoning. The property was part of an area the City Council excluded from a new residential district mapped in the northwest quadrant of the rezoning.\nPer City Council: The rezoning would pave the way for 9,535 housing units. That\u2019s 141 fewer units than the previously projected 9,676 units.\nCity Planning came up with slightly different numbers: In a technical memo detailing the City Council\u2019s modifications to the rezoning, the agency indicated that 193 apartments would be lost as a result of the Council\u2019s changes.\nIt is not clear why these calculations are different.\nThe Council\u2019s carveout in the northwest quadrant did not include any of the 61 \u201cprojected development sites\u201d City Planning predicted would take advantage of the rezoning. It did, however, include one \u201cpotential\u201d site at 240 West 37th Street, where City Planning initially estimated 293 apartments could be built.\nYet, City Planning pegged the projected loss of apartments, due to the City Council\u2019s change in this quadrant, at 76 units.\nPotential sites are considered less likely to be developed in the 10 years following the rezoning (for a number of reasons, such as odd lot shape, tons of commercial tenants or because the lot has already been built out significantly).\nThe unit projections of the seven potential sites were not included in the initial housing estimates released by the city, so it would be weird to say 293 housing units were lost in this area. A City Planning spokesperson said the the 76 units referred to apartments that would have been converted from office space, in addition to the projected sites.\nAnother 117 projected housing units were shaved off the 9,676 units previously estimated because the City Council reduced the maximum residential floor area ratio from 18 to 15 in the southeast quadrant of the rezoning area. I actually checked the four sites affected by this (based on previous unit estimates and lot sizes), and got the same result.\n\nBut that, again, is just on the sites City Planning previously identified as likely candidates for redevelopment.\nBarbara Blair, president of the Garment District Alliance, believes these estimates lowball the potential housing lost thanks to the City Council\u2019s modifications. She told\nTRD\nfellow Quinn Waller that she believes the number to be closer to 1,000 units of housing that will not be built across the nearly 40 properties carved out by the City Council (that, of course, assumes those owners would opt to take advantage of the rezoning or sell their properties to someone who would).\nWe\u2019ll never know exactly how many properties within the carveout areas would have flipped to residential, if ultimately given the chance.\nWe will, however, be able to see how many of the 9,535 apartments in the neighborhood ultimately get built over the next decade. Keep an eye out for more coverage from us on the rezoning.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat real estate-related books are you reading? Send recommendations to kathryn@therealdeal.com\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nPenn Yan, a village in New York near Keuka Lake, is home to the world\u2019s largest pancake griddle, which is 28 feet in diameter. The griddle is on display on Main Street, and was used in 1987 to make a record-breaking buckwheat pancake.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 New York lawmakers are launching an investigation into the state\u2019s property insurance market as premiums surge, fueled by climate-driven risks, according to the\nTimes Union\n. They say insurers are posting record profits while homeowners face skyrocketing costs, threatening affordability and access to housing.\n\u2014 City councilmembers are pressing Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 administration to enforce a nearly two-year-old law requiring inspections of vacant apartments after neighbors report hazards like leaks, rats and open windows,\nGothamist\nreports. Despite the law passing in December 2023, city agencies have yet to implement the 311 complaint system that would trigger inspections, frustrating tenants and elected officials. \u2014\nQuinn Waller\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$12.4 million\nfor a condominium unit at 201 East 74th Street. The Lenox Hill condo is a new construction, 3,800-square-foot unit.\nDouglas Elliman\nhas the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$1.1 billion\nfor 590 Madison Avenue. RXR\u2019s Scott Rechler bought the office building from the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio pension fund in what is the most expensive NYC office sale since 2022 when the Google parent company purchased 550 Washington Street,\nper reports\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $15 million for a penthouse unit at 515 West 23rd Street. The Chelsea condo is 3,600 square feet and listed by\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\n.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for a proposed 72,065-square-foot, 11-story residential building with 69 dwelling units. Daniel Bernstein of Kutnicki Bernstein Architects is the applicant of record.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

        "content": "Asking dollar volume for signed contracts in Palm Beach County surged last week, rallying to a late summer high.\nBuyers signed 18 contracts between Aug. 11 and Aug. 17 for luxury properties in Palm Beach County, according to a market report from\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s\nEklund-Gomes\nteam. The homes that went pending last week totaled $117.8 million in asking volume and averaged 111 days on the market. That\u2019s up from\n$71.5 million\nin asking volume for 10 homes the previous week.\nThe team\u2019s report tracks signed contracts for single-family homes and condos asking $3 million or more in the Beaches MLS. It identified 47 new listings, and a total of 1,004 active listings on the market.\nSixteen single-family homes and two condos found buyers last week. The condos that went pending are asking an average of $4.3 million, or $1,613 per square foot, and spent an average of 73 days on the market.\n\nThe single-family homes totaled $109.3 million in asking volume and averaged 150 days on the market. The average asking price works out to $6.8 million.\nThe priciest home to find a buyer is the 9,000-square-foot waterfront mansion at 311 East Key Palm Road in Boca Raton, asking $17.8 million. Records show the seller of the\nRoyal Palm Yacht &amp; Country Club\nhome is Derek Ettinger. Records show he bought the home for $12 million in 2021. It was built in 2015 on 0.5-acres and includes six bedrooms, eight bathrooms, two half-bathrooms, a pool and a dock, according to property records.\nEttinger listed it for $17.8 million in February, Zillow shows. David Roberts with Royal Palm Properties has the listing.\nThe next most expensive home to go pending is the 7,700-square-foot waterfront home at 989 Marble Way in\nBoca Raton\n, asking $14.5 million. Records show the sellers are Lawrence and Ivy Freedman, who bought the home for $11.9 million last year. The house was built last year on 0.3 acres, according to property records. It has five bedrooms, five bathrooms, two half-bathrooms, a pool, a dock and 119 feet of waterfront, records and the listing show.\nThe couple listed it for $17.9 million last year, and dropped the price four times, according to Redfin. Nicholas Gonzalez and Matthew Moser with Serhant have the listing.",

        "content": "The math around the Midtown South rezoning is confusing.\nSpecifically, the adjustments that the City Council made ahead of approving the rezoning underscore just how slippery the housing projections that accompany major zoning changes can be. Were 141 potential housing units lost? Closer to 500? Or 1,000?\nAs part of the environmental review process, the Department of City Planning identifies development sites that are likely to be redeveloped if zoning changes are made, based on a number of factors. That doesn\u2019t mean the agency has received confirmation from the owners of these sites that they will actually take advantage of the rezoning.\nBy the same token, some sites where the owners are keen to redevelop aren\u2019t necessarily included in those projections.\nConsider Expansion Group\u2019s 554-568 Eighth Avenue, a 21-story, vacant office building that was being marketed as a potentially ideal office-to-residential conversion, thanks to the rezoning. The property was part of an area the City Council excluded from a new residential district mapped in the northwest quadrant of the rezoning.\nPer City Council: The rezoning would pave the way for 9,535 housing units. That\u2019s 141 fewer units than the previously projected 9,676 units.\nCity Planning came up with slightly different numbers: In a technical memo detailing the City Council\u2019s modifications to the rezoning, the agency indicated that 193 apartments would be lost as a result of the Council\u2019s changes.\nIt is not clear why these calculations are different.\nThe Council\u2019s carveout in the northwest quadrant did not include any of the 61 \u201cprojected development sites\u201d City Planning predicted would take advantage of the rezoning. It did, however, include one \u201cpotential\u201d site at 240 West 37th Street, where City Planning initially estimated 293 apartments could be built.\nYet, City Planning pegged the projected loss of apartments, due to the City Council\u2019s change in this quadrant, at 76 units.\nPotential sites are considered less likely to be developed in the 10 years following the rezoning (for a number of reasons, such as odd lot shape, tons of commercial tenants or because the lot has already been built out significantly).\nThe unit projections of the seven potential sites were not included in the initial housing estimates released by the city, so it would be weird to say 293 housing units were lost in this area. A City Planning spokesperson said the the 76 units referred to apartments that would have been converted from office space, in addition to the projected sites.\nAnother 117 projected housing units were shaved off the 9,676 units previously estimated because the City Council reduced the maximum residential floor area ratio from 18 to 15 in the southeast quadrant of the rezoning area. I actually checked the four sites affected by this (based on previous unit estimates and lot sizes), and got the same result.\n\nBut that, again, is just on the sites City Planning previously identified as likely candidates for redevelopment.\nBarbara Blair, president of the Garment District Alliance, believes these estimates lowball the potential housing lost thanks to the City Council\u2019s modifications. She told\nTRD\nfellow Quinn Waller that she believes the number to be closer to 1,000 units of housing that will not be built across the nearly 40 properties carved out by the City Council (that, of course, assumes those owners would opt to take advantage of the rezoning or sell their properties to someone who would).\nWe\u2019ll never know exactly how many properties within the carveout areas would have flipped to residential, if ultimately given the chance.\nWe will, however, be able to see how many of the 9,535 apartments in the neighborhood ultimately get built over the next decade. Keep an eye out for more coverage from us on the rezoning.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nWhat real estate-related books are you reading? Send recommendations to kathryn@therealdeal.com\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nPenn Yan, a village in New York near Keuka Lake, is home to the world\u2019s largest pancake griddle, which is 28 feet in diameter. The griddle is on display on Main Street, and was used in 1987 to make a record-breaking buckwheat pancake.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014 New York lawmakers are launching an investigation into the state\u2019s property insurance market as premiums surge, fueled by climate-driven risks, according to the\nTimes Union\n. They say insurers are posting record profits while homeowners face skyrocketing costs, threatening affordability and access to housing.\n\u2014 City councilmembers are pressing Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 administration to enforce a nearly two-year-old law requiring inspections of vacant apartments after neighbors report hazards like leaks, rats and open windows,\nGothamist\nreports. Despite the law passing in December 2023, city agencies have yet to implement the 311 complaint system that would trigger inspections, frustrating tenants and elected officials. \u2014\nQuinn Waller\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Monday was\n$12.4 million\nfor a condominium unit at 201 East 74th Street. The Lenox Hill condo is a new construction, 3,800-square-foot unit.\nDouglas Elliman\nhas the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$1.1 billion\nfor 590 Madison Avenue. RXR\u2019s Scott Rechler bought the office building from the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio pension fund in what is the most expensive NYC office sale since 2022 when the Google parent company purchased 550 Washington Street,\nper reports\n.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was $15 million for a penthouse unit at 515 West 23rd Street. The Chelsea condo is 3,600 square feet and listed by\nSotheby\u2019s International Realty\n.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for a proposed 72,065-square-foot, 11-story residential building with 69 dwelling units. Daniel Bernstein of Kutnicki Bernstein Architects is the applicant of record.\n\u2014 Joseph Jungermann",

        "content": "A company owned by two New Zealander brothers who built their fortune off toys and consumer products is behind the recent purchase of multiple burned lots in Malibu.\nNick and Mat Mowbray, who founded Zuru Group, also own development company Zuru Tech US LLC. The latter entity and its El Segundo address appear across the deeds and state registration statements tied to nine Malibu land sales that occurred between March and the first half of this month.\nKevin Shelburn, who is the founder of Mar Vista-based Shelburn Realty Group, first unraveled the mystery via a\nvideo he posted\non Instagram.\nThe Mowbrays\u2019 involvement was unknown when\nRealtor.com\nfirst broke news of nine lots on La Costa and Carbon beaches in Malibu selling for a total of $65 million. Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California\u2019s Weston Littlefield and Alex Howe brokered most of the deals on behalf of the buyer.\nThe two declined to divulge the identity of their client in an interview with\nThe Real Deal\nlast week.\nEight of the sales tied to Littlefield and Howe in the Multiple Listing Service \u2014 sold for between $5 million and $13.8 million \u2014 all track back to the Mowbrays\u2019 local Zuru entity with the business filings signed off by U.S. director of operations Marcel Fontijn. A ninth lot, which sold for $5 million, was handled by Keller Williams\u2019 Benyamin Illulian and can also be traced to the Mowbrays.\nA message left at Zuru\u2019s El Segundo office was not returned Monday afternoon and an email listed online as the contact for the office bounced back.\n\nThe lots on prime oceanfront real estate could make good case studies for Zuru Tech\u2019s \u201cdigital solution for construction\u201d of homes and commercial buildings. Among the items the company touts on its website is the ability to manufacture prefabricated concrete walls that promise fireproofing and earthquake resistance. The company also uses digital printing for finishes such as wood, marble, stone, metal and other prints and patterns.\nThe Mowbrays founded Zuru Group in 2003 and, according to a late 2024\nBloomberg\nreport, the company was projected to have revenue of $1.7 billion in that same year. The business\u2019 growth pushed the brothers onto the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nZuru first found success with toys like Bunch O Balloons (water balloons that fill up fast and seal themselves) and Mini Brands (think mini Q-tip, Barbasol and other miniatures of brand-name items). The brothers then moved into personal care items with the Rascal and Friends diaper brand, hair car line Monday, and pet food under the label Nood, among several other segments.\nThe Mowbrays didn\u2019t stop there, entering real estate construction with software that allows for homes and buildings to be designed online with the materials produced in the company\u2019s China factory.\nBloomberg reported Zuru acquired its 25-acre factory in China to make homes with plans to send those test structures to Los Angeles this year.\nNick Mowbray told Bloomberg Zuru\u2019s housing business is set to \u201cdwarf everything we\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\n",

        "content": "A century-old office tower on Wacker Drive scored a win for owners betting on a shaky downtown market.\nSheridan Capital Partners signed a 25,400-square-foot lease in the Jewelers Building at 35 East Wacker Drive, relocating its headquarters from the Wrigley Building, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\nThe deal is a boost for Prime Group and Chicago-based Clayco\u2019s development arm CRG, which paid $36 million, or $65 per square foot, for the 556,000-square-foot\nlandmark\nlast year. The joint venture bought the building out of distress \u2014 lender John Hancock had filed a $65 million\nforeclosure\nsuit against the prior owner, Toronto-based Dorchester \u2014 wagering that upgrades and targeted tenant improvements could breathe life into the Loop asset. It was the first time the property has changed ownership since 1981.\nIt was about one-third vacant, a little worse than the broader downtown average, when they acquired it. With Sheridan\u2019s move, plus a lease extension by design firm SmithGroup and an expansion by CRG and parent company Clayco, the building is about 70 percent leased. Michael Reschke Jr., executive vice president for Prime Group, said the results show the strategy of modernizing the nearly 100-year-old tower is \u201cyielding great results.\u201d\n\nJLL\u2019s Pat Schenk and Bill Rogers represented Sheridan in the lease negotiations, while Madison Rose\u2019s Adam Pines and Andrew Marty handled the deal for ownership.\nThe lease signals the landlords intend to keep the building primarily an office play. Sources previously told the outlet the buyers\nconsidered\na partial conversion to apartments or hotel rooms, an increasingly common route for vintage office properties squeezed by remote work. A spokesman declined to say whether that remains on the table.\nSheridan is leaving one Chicago landmark \u2014 billionaire Joe Mansueto\u2019s Wrigley Building \u2014 for another. Jonathan Lewis, a partner at Sheridan, said 35 East Wacker offered the right blend of \u201chistoric character and modern amenities\u201d for clients and staff. The Jewelers Building, completed in 1926 and landmarked in 1994, is best known for its 40th-floor cupola, once rumored to house a Capone-era speakeasy and later reimagined by architect Helmut Jahn.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Minskoff Equities with a $138 million pre-foreclosure suit on Friday.\nEJME defaulted on three mortgages tied to an 11-story office building at 29 Jay Street in Dumbo, Brooklyn, according to the lender. The note came due in November of 2024 and the maturity date was not extended,\nPincusCo\nreported.\nThe loan was initially issued by AIG Investments, but later taken over by Corebridge Financial, which was formed in 2022 following a spinoff of AIG\u2019s assets.\nEJME bought 29-35 Jay Street from the Forman Group in March 2020 for $61.5 million, when the site was occupied by a two-story brick warehouse. The deal was backed by a $40 million acquisition loan from Bank of America. In August of 2020, the firm filed plans to construct a 184,467-square-foot commercial building.\nThough EJME requested an extension on the project, the suit alleges that the developer didn\u2019t pay the extension request fee.\n\nIn July, EJME found itself facing another potential foreclosure of its leasehold at three office buildings at 500-512 Seventh Avenue, along with partners Meyer Chetrit and Joseph Moinian. In that suit, the lender alleged that the partnership was not collecting rent and that the lender had to pay the project\u2019s electricity bill after the partnership failed to do so.\nIn December 2024, the borrower\nnearly defaulted\non an office tower at 1166 Sixth Avenue but secured a refinancing from lender Wells Fargo.\nDespite the defaults, EJME has secured several large tenants in recent months.

        "content": "Angel Nicolas, a top agent at Compass with more than $200 million in combined sales over the past year, left the brokerage to join Serhant,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nNicolas\u2019 license was moved to Serhant on Monday, state licensing records show. Nicolas, a former professional baseball player, had been with Compass since 2019 and was named one of the brokerage\u2019s top 100 agents for 2024.\nMost of Nicolas\u2019 18-person team is also in the process of transitioning to Serhant, he said.\nNicolas has closed nearly $2 billion in sales since he became a real estate agent in 2016, according to a press release. Nicolas focuses on neighborhoods that include Coconut Grove, Gables Estates, Pinecrest, Ponce Davis and Southwest Ranches.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a tough move to be honest because I am quite happy with Compass,\u201d Nicolas said. Ryan Serhant, founder and CEO of his company, had been speaking with Nicolas over the past three years.\nNicolas said he was excited at the opportunity to start a nationwide luxury division at the brokerage.\n\u201cHim [Serhant] and I have been talking about how we can become the No. 1 team in Miami,\u201d Nicolas said. \u201cWe both want to be No. 1 in all of Florida. That\u2019s the plan.\u201d\nNicolas brokered both sides of the\n$19.3 million sale\nof a penthouse at Grove at Grand Bay in 2023, which marked a record for Coconut Grove condo sales.\n\nA team member of his, William Abreu, also a former professional baseball player, represented the buyer of a massive estate in Davie when it sold earlier this year for a\nrecord $25.5 million\n. Streamer Adin Ross purchased the property.\nNicolas said South Florida\u2019s luxury sector has been stable, with demand still high for turkey homes. He expects demand will grow if\nZohran Mamdani\nbecomes mayor of New York City.\n\u201cThe homes sitting on the market need a lot of work or are teardowns. Your special homes in special neighborhoods are setting records,\u201d he said. Nicolas recently represented the seller in the $6.3 million sale of the home at 7425 Southwest 56th Avenue in Miami, which set a record for the Ponce-Davis neighborhood.\nSerhant aims to open offices in Coconut Grove, Coral Gables and Miami Beach, Nicolas said.\nNicolas\u2019 move marks a win for Ryan Serhant\u2019s brokerage, which has been expanding in South Florida. In May, Serhant brought on\nGary Pohrer\nto help lead the Palm Beach office. Pohrer was part of the Exclusive Group at Douglas Elliman.\nSerhant first expanded to South Florida when it\nopened up shop\nin Delray Beach in 2023. The brokerage now has about 260 agents in Florida, including Tyler Cameron and founding agents Mariana Niro and Chris Prakas, according to state licensing records.\nCompass declined to comment.\n",

Both plans top the building out at 46 stories.\nBy envisioning two potential pathways to moving forward at the site, the companies would have \u201cthe flexibility to respond thoughtfully to market dynamics while maximizing the site\u2019s potential to serve both the university and the surrounding community,\u201d according to a statement cited by the Business Times.\nIn June, an affiliate of Lincoln and McCourt secured the right to acquire the 0.8-acre site at 536 Mission where GGU\u2019s 230,000-square-foot building stands.\n\nIn the deal, Lincoln offered the school a $21.9 million loan to cover its existing debts on its campus property and locked down the option to purchase the property outright in the coming years, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. Both would help the private school recoup funds.\nThe office tower would include 9,409 of retail and 23,000 square feet of public open space. The mixed-use variant would include a combination of studio, one- and two-bedroom units as well as 1,784 square feet of retail, 17,250 square feet of public open space and additional square footage for parking.\nGolden Gate University placed the 536 Mission building\nup for sale in 2022\n, though it didn\u2019t attract a buyer the school was willing to work with. Earlier this year, the school\nbegan looking for a partner\nto recapitalize the property.\nUnder the partnership agreement, GGU would have \u201cflexible options\u201d to stay at 536 Mission Street, GGU\u2019s chief financial officer Elaine Clark told faculty and staff, according to the Business Times. If the university decides to relocate, it would do so as early as next fall.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Is the Trump administration using ICE agents to strong-arm landlords for information on tenants?\nA recent advisory from the Arlington, Virginia-based National Apartment Association, which the Apartment Association of Greater Dallas distributed to its members, indicates as much.\n\u201cWhile the U.S. government originally stated that its initial focus would be the removal of non-citizens with criminal convictions, beefing up border enforcement and terminating humanitarian parole programs, enforcement activity has spread beyond those limits, due in part to increasing pressure on ICE to increase its deportation numbers,\u201d the advisory said.\nThe Apartment Association of Greater Dallas counts members ranging from global investors to local landlords and covers one of ICE\u2019s most active areas.\nThe Dallas trade group posted the advisory on its website late last month and then went silent, declining comment when\nThe Real Deal\nasked to follow up on the broad warning.\nThat\u2019s part of a pattern that\u2019s played out on the other side of the landlord-tenant equation in Texas. The San Antonio-based nonprofit immigrant advocacy group RAICES also issued a warning but declined to say whether ICE has been pressuring Texas landlords with illegitimate requests.\n\u201cDespite agency arguments to the contrary, ICE warrants are agency directives and should not be misconstrued as having the same legal authority of judicial warrants,\u201d RAICES spokesperson Faisal Al-Juburi said. \u201cHowever, that does not minimize the coercive threat likely felt by anyone, regardless of status, who is approached by masked individuals claiming to be federal enforcement officials.\u201d\nA Georgia attorney said his landlord clients received subpoenas from ICE requesting tenant information, the Associated Press\nreported\nlast month. However, along with Dallas apartment association and RAICES, various Texas and local tenant associations declined to say whether ICE has been serving subpoenas at Texas apartments, much less whether the agency has used them illegitimately.\nReports of ICE agents serving legal papers at apartment complexes have come with little clarity on whether subpoenas or warrants were involved. It\u2019s not clear whether federal agents were accompanied by local police, or whether landlords or tenants were targets or points of contact.\n\nRumors of ICE inquiries at Texas apartments have been simmering, but little evidence has surfaced.\nState Rep. Ana-Maria Ramos, who represents parts of Dallas, posted on Facebook last month that ICE agents had been spotted knocking doors at apartments on Audelia Road, citing a post on a message board.\nOthers who have been firebrands in opposition to ICE in the past have gone silent more recently when asked for information or comment on the Trump administration\u2019s deployment of the agency in Texas.\nU.S. Representative Greg Casar \u2014 a former member of the Austin City Council\nwho has inveighed against ICE raids in Texas\n\u2014 did not respond to a request for comment on the most recent ruckus over the agency.\nICE has a field office based in Dallas, and North Texas ICE agents have made more arrests than any other regional office. However, available government data is only current through January.\nThe data does not indicate how arrests were made \u2014 worksite raids, apartments sweeps or individual apprehension. Murkiness aside, the Arlington, Virginia-based National Apartment Association clarified its\nguidance\nfor members on the difference between subpoenas and warrants.\n\u201cSubpoenas are demands for the production of information, with a deadline to produce that information sometime in the future. This means that you can accept the document, regardless of the type of subpoena, and then consult counsel with regard to whether or how to comply,\u201d the advisory stated.\nAuthors of the advisory letter include former Department of Homeland Security general counsel Jonathan Meyer, who served in the post during the Biden administration.\nLandlords are not obliged to surrender residents\u2019 information unless ICE has a criminal warrant, according to the National Apartment Association.\n",

        "content": "Investor Babak Ebrahimzadeh sold an office building and an adjacent garage with mixed-use development potential in Riviera Beach\u2019s Singer Island for $16.5 million.\nEbrahimzadeh, through his Miami-based Master Mind, sold the Ocean Blue property consisting of a five-story office building and three-level garage at 2655 North Ocean Drive, according to brokers and records. The buyer is George Jay II, Limited Partnership, an entity tied to real estate investor George Johnnides. The deal closed on Friday.\nRachel Mitrogiannis of Ascella Group and Earl Hollis III of Hollis Realty Group represented the seller. Paul Snitkin of Anderson Carr represented the buyer.\nThe 45,000-square-foot office building and roughly 200-space garage were completed in 1989 on a 1.7-acre site, property records show. Ebrahimzadeh, who paid $8.6 million for the buildings in 2022, completed improvements over the past three years, including floor replacement in bathrooms and hallways; porcelain floor tile installation in the lobby; and other interior renovations. Master Mind invested roughly $3 million in capital improvements, according to Mitrogiannis.\nOcean Blue is about 70 percent occupied, with former professional golfer Greg Norman leasing the penthouse for his business, Mitrogiannis said. Other tenants include Florida Sugar &amp; Molasses Exchange. Los Angeles-based Le Petit Prince Cafe will open in January in the commercial space between the garage and office building.\nBy-right, about 225,000 square feet of residential or other uses can be developed atop the garage, Mitrogiannis said.\nJohnnides plans to lease up the office building first, including the roughly 5,500 square feet of first-floor restaurant space, before pursuing development, according to Snitkin.\n\u201cDown the road, we are going to do something there, but first we will get this asset stabilized,\u201d Snitkin said, adding that Johnnides hasn\u2019t yet decided if he would pursue office or residential development. \u201cWhen we get to that stage, it depends on what\u2019s needed.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in South Florida, Johnnides has invested in South Beach. In June, he sold the 19,700-square-foot Office Depot-leased building at 1771 West Avenue in Miami Beach\u2019s Sunset Harbour neighborhood for\n$28.5 million\n.\nEbrahimzadeh\u2019s other South Florida investments include paying\n$5.5 million\nin 2022 for the 10,000-square-foot office building at 1545 Centrepark Drive North in West Palm Beach, with plans at the time to redevelop it into a 12-story office building.\nEbrahimzadeh and Nader Ohebshalom also lead Gatsby FL, an arm of New York-based Gatsby Enterprises. Last year, Gatsby FL bought the 10-story One Town Center office building and attached garage at 1 Town Center Road in Boca Raton for\n$82 million\n.\nGatsby Enterprises also owns the 15-story 800 Brickell office tower and adjacent garage at 800 Brickell Avenue in Miami. It had paid\n$125.5 million\nfor it in 2019.\nSouth Florida\u2019s\noffice market\nhas slowed compared to the leasing and investment sales bonanza during the pandemic. Prime areas such as Brickell and downtown West Palm Beach have continued to boom, while\nsuburban areas and less desirable buildings\nhave felt the sting from elevated interest rates and inflation. The influx of out-of-state companies also has slowed.\nIn March, Jorge Linkewer, principal at Aventura-based Triarch Capital Group, and Sarah and Sergio Selcer bought the Airport Commerce Park office complex at 4101 Ravenswood Road in Dania Beach for\n$18.3 million\n.\nIn Brickell, Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega is expected to purchase the 30-story Sabadell Financial Center at 1111 Brickell Avenue in Miami for\n$275 million\n.\n",

(Colony Capital was once Colony Northstar and is now DigitalBridge). Christopher Rising declined to comment.\n\nThe 42-story, Bunker Hill office tower is worth less than the debt connected to it and less than its purchase price. A recent appraisal put its value at about $121 million, compared to $459 million at loan issuance in 2017. Occupancy plummeted to about 63 percent this year compared to 88 percent at underwriting, according to Morningstar Credit.\nNet operating income fell to $9 million in June 2024 from $17 million in December 2023, the latest data available shows. The complaint notes that the plaintiff believes the borrower intends to consent to the appointment of a receiver.\nDowntown Los Angeles has an about 33 percent office\nvacancy rate\n; Bunker Hill has a slightly lower vacancy rate at about 31 percent.\n",

The median home sales price hit $330,000, up 4 percent year-over-year, even as the statewide median slipped 1.1 percent to $345,000. San Antonio is now moving in the opposite direction of Texas overall: more sluggish deal flow, but pricing that\u2019s proving stickier.\nSupply climbed to 6.12 months in July, crossing the six-month marker brokers typically use to mark\nbalance\nbetween buyers and sellers, putting the ball in the buyers\u2019 court. Homes are also sitting longer, averaging 74 days on the market \u2014 a 16 percent increase from last summer. Pending sales fell 24 percent, a sign that some would-be buyers are hesitating despite more choices. Active listings rose 14 percent to more than 17,100.\n\u201cThe leverage is shifting,\u201d SABOR chair Ed Zapata said in the report, noting that buyers are taking their time to weigh options as inventory builds.\n\nSan Antonio is the value play compared with other big Texas metros. Bexar County\u2019s $310,000 median trails far behind Travis County\u2019s $560,000 and Dallas County\u2019s $390,000, while Harris County is level with San Antonio at $330,000. Austin leads on price but has seen sharp corrections since its pandemic peak, while Houston\u2019s vast\nsupply\nhas kept a lid on appreciation. Dallas-Fort Worth is in the middle \u2014 pricier than San Antonio but still drawing buyers priced out of Austin.\nMortgage rates could prove the swing factor. Freddie Mac pegged the 30-year fixed at 6.58 percent last week, its lowest since October and the fourth straight weekly decline. If borrowing costs continue to ease, markets like San Antonio \u2014 with relatively lower entry prices and fresh inventory \u2014 could see\ndemand\nrebound faster than Austin or Dallas, where affordability is more strained.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "You probably weren\u2019t thinking about \u201cgood cause eviction\u201d when you read in\nThe Real Deal\nlast week that Miki Naftali\nplans to demolish\n800 Fifth Avenue after buying it from Eliot Spitzer. But Naftali surely did.\nBecause of good cause, raze-and-rebuild and other value-add projects in New York are\na lot harder\nthan they used to be for free-market buildings. The law, which the state\npassed last year\n, forces landlords to offer lease renewals to most tenants who are current on rent and not axe murderers.\nIf Naftali had to offer renewals to all the tenants at 800 Fifth, he would have to buy them out to get them to leave. That would be prohibitively expensive if not impossible.\nA successful developer such as Naftali would not hand Spitzer more than $800 million for the building, nor did JPMorgan Chase lend him $675 million for the purchase, without certainty that he could empty the 208-unit building and put a condo tower in its place.\nBut it\u2019s more complicated than you would think. And some folks in the real estate industry are wondering whether ambitious tenants could ask Naftali for a buyout and \u2014 citing good cause eviction \u2014 threaten to hold out if he refuses.\nAt first blush, it wouldn\u2019t seem like they have a case: The good cause eviction law does not apply if the building is being demolished.\nBut technically, Naftali is not going to demolish 800 Fifth Avenue. Rather, he will rebuild it. \u201cContextual redevelopment,\u201d the firm said.\nThat is because 800 Fifth is overbuilt, meaning it\u2019s larger than zoning allows, thanks to a special permit that Spitzer\u2019s late father, famed developer Bernard Spitzer, obtained from the city to put up the 33-story tower in the\nlate 1970s\n.\n\nDemolishing more than 75 percent of the building would prevent Naftali from constructing an equally overbuilt tower in its place, according to PropertyScout CEO Wilson Parry. Given the purchase price, construction costs and the incredible premium buyers pay to own on Fifth Avenue, he needs to build as many square feet as is allowed. Rebuilding, rather than razing, will preserve the special permit.\nSo if good cause\u2019s demolition exception doesn\u2019t apply, how can Naftali refuse to renew leases? Because there\u2019s another\nexception in the law\nthat applies to high rents, defined as at least 245 percent of the \u201c\nfair market rent\n.\u201d This year, the high-rent threshold is $6,152 for a one-bedroom apartment.\nThe law doesn\u2019t protect tenants in luxury units. It\u2019s one of the few times that being rich works against you. (A dozen other building types are exempt from good cause, including co-ops, condos, hotels, dorms, religious facilities, income-restricted rentals and properties owned by small landlords.)\nA glance at StreetEasy\u2019s list of\npast rentals at 800 Fifth\nsuggests that all of the units are leased for more than 245 percent of the fair market rent. The only recent leases for one-bedrooms even close to the threshold were Unit 16A, which rented for $7,000 a month in May 2024; Unit 11A, $6,700 in November 2022; and 12A, $6,750 in June 2022.\nMight there be some old-timers who got favorable deals from Bernard Spitzer that his son kept in place? Anyone paying less than 245 percent of the fair market rent could try to shake down Naftali if they were so inclined.\nBut a source said all the rents are north of the threshold. That would rule out the risk of holdouts as a reason Naftali was able to pay about 25 percent less than the\n$1 billion\nthat Spitzer was reportedly asking last winter for the property.\nRegardless, the deal for 800 Fifth Ave is a reminder of the potential complications presented by good cause for anyone looking to upgrade a multifamily building in New York.\n",

That was before Bridges\nsubmitted preliminary plans\nearly last year for a mixed-use development with affordable housing to the Department of City Planning, kicking off the rezoning process.\nThe plan required rezoning from commercial to mixed commercial and residential. At the time, Bridges\u2019 Michael Berfield said the project would include about 250 studio to three-bedroom apartments, more than half of them affordable. The 90,000-square-foot retail portion of the project would also include a grocery, he said.\nThe City Council approved the rezoning in June, despite\nconcerns from local residents\nabout shadows on local play areas for children and fears of gentrification, but with deeper affordability than was initially proposed. The developer must now set aside 20 percent of the project\u2019s units for households making an average of 40 percent of the area median income, with income bands capped at 130 percent AMI, according to the approved rezoning.\nIt was unclear whether Bridges intended to flip the property all along. Representatives from CW Realty and Bridges did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",

Newcastle secured approval in 2021 after scaling back its initial 42-story proposal, which drew pushback from Ward 2 Alderman Brian Hopkins and neighbors. But the developer never started construction and has now exited at a loss of roughly $22 million.\nIt\u2019s unclear what Convexity will do with the site, though the acquisition expands its\nGold Coast\nfootprint, and zoning entitlements are typically in place for six years. The firm owns the adjacent Viceroy Hotel, a 180-room property that opened in 2017, and has been an active player in upscale redevelopment near Mariano Park.\nRecent projects\nnearby\ninclude the Newberry on the Triangle retail revamp at 1030 North State Street and a wave of restaurant investments that have reinforced the district\u2019s draw.\n\nFor Newcastle, the sale marks a rare retreat in a neighborhood where it has been an aggressive residential developer. Its Gold Coast track record includes the 35-story Bernardin apartments at 845 North State Street and an 89-unit building at 1210 North State Parkway.\nThe discounted deal highlights the challenges developers face when timelines collide with shifting conditions. While Newcastle managed to win zoning approval after redesigning its plan, the company may have balked at moving forward amid high financing costs and inflated construction costs.\nConvexity has a track record of\nrepositioning properties\nin prime locations and could opt for something other than the approved apartments.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Short-term rental registrations across the L.A. region have dipped in what could be a perfect storm preventing the growth of such properties.\nFrom last July to this July, there was a 6 percent decrease in active Home Sharing registrations in the city of Los Angeles, the L.A. Times\nreported\n. Last summer, there were 4,228, while they dipped to 3,972 last month.\nListings are also down for short-term rental, with\nAirbnb\nregistering a 13 percent dip from July of last year, according to AllTheRooms data cited by the Times. Overall short-term rentals in the L.A. metro area fell 44 percent in the same period, according to the report.\nWhile AirDNA reported an 8 percent increase in Airbnb and VRBO listings over the past year, listings have decreased since January in the areas affected by the deadly wildfires, falling 56 percent in Altadena, 36 percent in Pacific Palisades and 25 percent in Malibu, according to the Times.\nVarious factors could be to blame for the decrease in short-term rentals, including the fires as well as local ordinances seeking to crack down on the market.\n\nIn 2018, the City of Los Angeles passed the Home-Sharing Ordinance, which required hosts to get a license and restricted them to renting out only their primary residence. Between 2019 and 2023, listings dropped 70 percent, coinciding with the pandemic.\nLast year, unincorporated parts of Los Angeles County became subject to the ordinance. It hasn\u2019t been able to fully combat\nillegal listings\n, however.\nAs of October 2024, there were an estimated 7,500 violations of the Home-Sharing Ordinance, but only 300 citations, a\nreport\nfrom the Los Angeles Housing Department last year said. In March, the\nL.A. City Council approved\na plan to increase fines based on square footage and to send out a group of staffers to monitor and enforce violations. But last year\u2019s budget didn\u2019t provide for such provisions, leaving many of them unimplemented.\nTo avoid fines ranging toward $10,000 or more, some hosts are turning to mid-term rentals of 30 days or more to skirt short-term rental regulations, according to the Times. Mid-term rentals could present a widely untapped market for hosts across the L.A. area; last year Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb,\ncalled\nmid-term stays a \u201chuge growth opportunity\u201d for the rental platform.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A high-profile legal battle involving a Chinese food hall in San Francisco is heating up.\nLast week, a judge ruled that the China Live restaurant complex at 644 Broadway must pay $6.7 million in disputed rent dating back to 2018, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nThe ruling has left owner and chef George Chen with few options; Chen told the Business Times he plans to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. China Live will continue operations unchanged for the foreseeable future as the business \u201csimply needs time to work out a mutually acceptable deal with the bank lender,\u201d Chen said.\nThe China Live complex opened in 2017 and spans 30,000 square feet across four stories.\nFormer landlord Chris Wight of Cypress Properties alleged that between January 2018 and February 2025, China Live withheld rent and other lease obligations.\nWight lost control of the building last year after defaulting on the building\u2019s mortgage, which he claims is a result of Chen withholding rent. Gregg Williams of Trident Pacific was appointed as receiver of the building after the default.\n\u201cAfter five and a half years, we finally achieved justice in court,\u201d Wight told the Business Times of the judge\u2019s ruling. \u201cChina Live owes all back rent totaling $6.7 million and had the financial means to pay rent but chose not to, which ultimately forced me into default.\u201d\n\nLast year, after several eviction attempts, China Live reached a settlement with Cypress Properties that would allow the food hall to remain a tenant on the property as long as it keeps up with its rent payments. The status of that arrangement remains unclear under the new receivership.\nThe receiver asked the court to rule China Live\u2019s lease \u201cterminated and forfeited,\u201d according to the Business Times. That would allow Williams \u2014 also the receiver of the\nbeleaguered San Francisco Centre mall\n\u2014 to negotiate new terms with China Live.\nLoan beneficiary Wells Fargo is hoping to resolve any outstanding loan deficiency with Wight after disposition of the property, a legal filing last month cited by the Business Times said. The financial institution is looking to either proceed with a nonjudicial foreclosure or the receiver will sell the property.\n\u201cI am now working closely with the receiver and lender in an effort to maintain ownership of the property with my partners going forward,\u201d Wight told the Business Times, calling the China Live building \u201ca remarkable project\u2026developed with great care\u201d and noting he \u201cremain[s] committed to its future.\u201d\nThe property was assessed at $13.1 million in March, marking a 61 percent decline from the underwriting assessment of $33.8 million and its lowest mark to date, per the Business Times.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Shvo is seeking to kick Core Club to the curb.\nMichael Shvo\u2019s firm started the process of evicting the exclusive members-only club from 711 Fifth Avenue, the former Coca-Cola Building.\nThe luxury developer and the ritzy social club have been engulfed in a gripping legal drama. In 2024, Core Club alleged Shvo\u2019s team over-promised and under-delivered on opening three club locations and sued Shvo for $600 million in damages. Shvo struck back, calling the lawsuit a \u201cpublic hit job\u201d intended to yield a rent reduction and other concessions.\n\u201cWe have made every effort to keep Core Club in the building,\u201d said Morris Missry, Wachtel Missry, an attorney representing Shvo. \u201cHowever, the tenant\u2019s ongoing inability, or unwillingness, to meet its lease obligations has left us with no choice but to initiate the eviction process.\u201d\nIn the background, Shvo is facing other issues, including negative headlines over his marquee Raleigh condo and hotel in Miami Beach, which could be sold after slow sales.\nSeparately, Shvo is in a dispute with his big-money\nGerman backers\n. Shvo has filed an arbitration claim, alleging he is owed more than $85 million in fees from the German pension fund BVK.\nCore Club\u2019s new attorney Marc Kasowitz, the company\u2019s third law firm in less than a year, claimed Shvo\u2019s attempt to evict Core Club is pinned to these broader issues.\n\u201cWhat convenient timing for a baseless claim targeting CORE: to be pushed to the press within hours of the Wall Street Journal publishing that \u2018Shvo\u2019s property empire is starting to crumble,\u2019 said Kasowitz in a statement. \u201cThis is nothing more than a desperate stunt by a convicted felon, seeking to deflect attention from his mounting international legal troubles as his real estate portfolio steadily unravels.\u201d\n\nThe litigation with Core Club, encompassing two lawsuits, has been ongoing for over a year. So far, Shvo is winning.\nIn a one lawsuit, a New York state judge recently ordered Core Club to pay Shvo close to\n$1 million\n. Core Club secured a $750,000 loan from Shvo in 2022, but the members-only club allegedly defaulted a year later when Core Club\u2019s location on Manhattan\u2019s Fifth Avenue opened up.\nCore Club accused Shvo of a \u201ccomplex, fraudulent scheme\u201d to gain control of its business. A New York Supreme Court judge said those defenses were not applicable. Core Club is appealing the ruling.\nShvo and Core Club are still duking it out in the other lawsuit.\nCore Club alleges Shvo misled the company\u2019s leadership about his ownership in 711 Fifth Avenue and San Francisco\u2019s Transamerica Pyramid, as well as plans for a $100 million buildout. The owners have demanded Shvo and his partners reduce the club\u2019s Manhattan rent, rescind its lease at Shvo\u2019s Transamerica Pyramid and pay $600 million in damages.\nCore Club further alleges Shvo racked up an $80,000 tab at its restaurant and used spaces for events for a kid\u2019s birthday party and weekly religious group meetings.\nShvo fired back, alleging the Core Club\u2019s fraud claims contradicted written agreements. The club\u2019s leases in New York and San Francisco were promised only $50 million in construction allowances, according to Shvo\u2019s filing.\nIn an unusual twist to the legal proceedings, Core Club\u2019s initial lawyer admitted to using artificial intelligence, which produced fake legal citations. He was instructed by the court to pay the landlord\u2019s legal fees.\n",

        "content": "The end has arrived for Yitzchak Tessler at 172 Madison Avenue.\nA federal court judge confirmed a reorganization plan of the developer\u2019s entity that controls the nearly decade-old condo project that will result in Tessler turning over the 10 remaining unsold residential and two commercial units at the 72-unit building to distressed debt investor ArcPe.\nTessler had entered the entity into bankruptcy one year ago to stave off ArcPe\u2019s foreclosure efforts. ArcPe had bought the construction loan on the building from Deutsche Bank for roughly $60 million in Jan. 2024.\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to go down like this.\nArcPe and Tessler had agreed upon a reorganization plan in June, in which ArcPe agreed to reduce its debt claim to $45.5 million from the original $65 million it was seeking and Tessler agreed to turn over the building\u2019s seven units while keeping the unfinished penthouse units for himself to sell.\nTessler was planning to obtain $35 million in exit financing, which would go towards finishing the penthouse units and paying down the remaining debt. He would also be contributing $3 million personally to pay down administrative expenses and fees.\nBut days before a hearing set at the end of July to confirm that plan, Tessler informed ArcPe that he would not have the funding required to move ahead with the plan as constituted.\nEver the deal-maker, Tessler tried for one last-ditch attempt to hold on to the penthouse units, submitting a status update at around 8 p.m. the night before the confirmation hearing.\n\nIn it, Tessler claimed to have found a co-developer willing to act as a guarantor for a $24.5 million refinancing of the five penthouse units, which would still leave him several million short of the money needed to confirm the reorganization plan.\nThe co-developer, Los Angeles-based Wylan/James, would receive 100 percent of the proceeds from the sale of the penthouse up to $10 million, and split the remaining sales 50/50, according to the term sheet submitted to the court. Assuming the finished penthouses had a value of $45 million as Tessler posited, he would receive $17.5 million for the penthouses, a far cry from the $98 million he once sought.\nAfter a delayed start to the hearing, in which Tessler\u2019s lawyer Kevin Nash couldn\u2019t access the Zoom, Nash made a plea to ArcPe and its lawyer, Offit Kurman\u2019s Jason Nagi, to consider extending the refinancing deadline and give Tessler time to finish his refinancing efforts, which would still require due diligence and appraisal.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity here that Mr. Tessler has isolated with new money and a fresh developer to finish off the construction on these unfinished units,\u201d Nash said in court.\nNagi and ArcPe were ultimately unmoved.\n\u201cMr. Tesler has burned up all of the goodwill he possibly could have had,\u201d said Nagi, pointing to a number of false starts on Tessler\u2019s part in terms of obtaining financing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to move on,\u201d he concluded.\nThe marketing for the unfinished penthouse units and the seven finished units will be handled by a Serhant team, including Jordan Hurt and Jessica Taylor. ArcPe\u2019s David Gordon said he expects sales to begin after Labor Day.\n",

The Hyundai name is used in various closely related companies based in South Korea including Hyundai Motor Group for vehicles, Hyundai Heavy Industries Group for shipbuilding and heavy machinery, and Hyundai Group for elevators and logistics. Hyundai Capital provides automotive financing options, while Hyundai Glovis handles logistics and supply chain management.\nThe 2300 Main Street building was previously leased by OptumRX and was developed by Irvine-based LBA Realty in 2002. Today, the five-floor office building is owned by Germany-based Manova Partners with Houston-based Hines serving as the property manager and CBRE handling leasing.\nHyundai Glovis\u2019 lease for 53,282 square feet in Irvine was the second-largest lease in O.C. in the first quarter, according to a Colliers office market\nreport\n. Irvine\u2019s Airport Area, where 2300 Main Street is located, is the county\u2019s largest office submarket. The Main Street building was the second largest piece of leasable space in the Airport Area, according to Stream data cited by the Business Journal.\nOffice leasing activity in Orange County is picking up, CBRE said in its latest office market\nreport\n. In the Southern California county, office leasing activity was up 23 percent quarter-over-quarter, with 279 deals for 1.8 million square feet of space signed in the second quarter of this year. Vacancy currently sits at 15.7 percent, according to the report.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Jeffrey Feil is being shaken down by yet another lender with the latest in a series of setbacks for his firm\u2019s commercial property investments in Chicago.\nHis struggles are emblematic of the\nlanguishing market for midsize loft-style offices\nas well as Loop high-rises while his firm struggles to satisfy lenders on each type of asset amid the downturn for commercial real estate stemming from remote work trends.\nPrivate equity giant KKR\u2019s securitized loan servicer K-Star Asset Management filed a foreclosure lawsuit this week against a venture of Feil\u2019s company, New York-based Feil Organization, in Cook County court. It alleges the landlord has defaulted on debt tied to a four-story, 35,000-square-foot loft office building, constructed in 1872, at 1027-1031 West Madison Street in the hot West Loop area.\nFeil bought the building in 2018 for $13.1 million, or $374 per square foot, using an $8.5 million loan originated by Citibank\u2019s real estate division. The loan was later sold off to investors in bonds backed by commercial property debts, opening up the financial details of its performance to the public.\nThe lender says Feil still owes over $8.2 million on the loan, after accounting for interest and fees following an April default on the mortgage, Cook County records show. The loan wasn\u2019t supposed to mature until the fall of 2028, but has since become more than three months delinquent as the building\u2019s vacancy lingers. The lender says Feil proposed a workout solution for the troubled debt, but K-Star found the terms unacceptable. The details of the proposal haven\u2019t been disclosed.\n\nThe property was fully leased through 2023, and brought in more than $1 million in revenue \u2014 plenty to cover the costs of debt service and operating the building, according to loan data. But its occupancy dropped to less than 50 percent last year, when it brought in only a little more than $437,000 in net cash flow, loan data shows.\nFeil didn\u2019t return a request for comment and neither did an attorney representing K-Star.\nThe alleged loan default is the landlord\u2019s latest blunder in Chicago\u2019s office market. Feil already surrendered a similar loft office building in River North, when it handed lender Beltway Capital the keys to 730 North Franklin Street last year to resolve a $15.3 million foreclosure lawsuit.\nPlus, Feil is facing a lawsuit brought by special servicer\nRialto Capital for an alleged default on a $105 million CMBS loan\ntied to 10 South LaSalle Street, a 781,000-square-foot building in the Loop. Feil has said it\u2019s working on resolving the dispute, but a receiver has been appointed to operate the property while the litigation plays out, loan data indicates.\nFurthermore, Feil is seeking either forbearance or another loan modification for a\n$75 million debt tied to the North Riverside Park Mall\nin suburban Chicago. The firm poured $9 million into renovating the 447,000-square-foot mall interior in a project that wrapped up last year, but it missed the maturity date on the loan, which is also a CMBS deal. The lender is considering Feil\u2019s request for another maturity date extension, after it already granted one to allow the mall renovation project to be completed, loan data shows.\n",

        "content": "The Bay Area could get nearly 500 additional Opportunity Zones as part of President Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\u201d\nThe\nOpportunity Zone 2.0 program\n, first introduced with President Trump\u2019s tax cuts in 2017, was made permanent with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, opening up a total of 480 census tracts in the Bay Area to greater investment, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n.\nThe San Francisco region stands to benefit the most from the plan, which offers tax incentives to those investing in low-income communities. There are 346 potential Opportunity Zones in the counties within the city\u2019s metro area, while down south in Silicon Valley, there are 134 census tracts that qualify under the federal government\u2019s new tax and spending changes to the Opportunity Zone program, according to the Business Times.\nAlameda County, home to enclaves like Oakland and Berkeley, topped the list with 105 potential Opportunity Zones. San Francisco and Santa Clara counties followed with 88 zones each.\nContra Costa County is next with 66 possible Opportunity Zones, according to census data analyzed by the Business Times.\nElsewhere in the San Francisco region, Solano County has 22 such zones, Sonoma County has 13, Marin County has 12, and Napa County has six. In Silicon Valley, Monterey County has 26 possible Opportunity Zones, Santa Cruz County has 14, and San Benito County has six.\n\nUnder the original\nOpportunity Zone program\npassed as part of Trump\u2019s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, 42,176 census tracks were eligible to become designated Opportunity Zones. But in the new version of the program, the number of eligible tracts could drop by more than 20 percent.\nIn the new law, Congress changed the definition of \u201clow-income community\u201d to census tracts with a median household income not exceeding 70 percent of an area\u2019s median income \u2014 a decrease from 80 percent previously. It would also make any census tract that has a poverty rate above 20 percent eligible for the program.\nThe federal government hasn\u2019t published an official list of eligible tracts yet. Governors have July 1 of next year to identify their targeted tracts for the program.\nCalifornia leads the country\nfor most tracts eligible for the program, with 2,738 pieces of land available for investment incentives. Los Angeles County tops the list with 846 tracts eligible for Opportunity Zone 2.0 tax breaks.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "TLC Management purchased a Vernon Hills apartment complex for $100 million, marking the biggest suburban multifamily trade so far this year.\nInvestor Stuart Handler\u2019s Chicago-based company acquired The Mil\u2019Ton, a 294-unit, three-building property at 1155 Museum Boulevard, from financial services firm\nMesirow\n, according to property records first\nreported\nby CoStar News. The price amounts to $340,100 per unit.\nMesirow bought the asset in 2018 for $87.1 million and listed it in March with CBRE brokers John Jaeger, Justin Puppi, Jason Zyck, Jillian Jaeger and Tricia Carolan.\nThe firm rebranded the property as The Majestic Luxury Apartments after a round of amenity renovations that included the clubhouse, gym, coworking areas, yoga space and pool. The seven-story complex, built in 2004, is 94 percent occupied with asking rents averaging nearly $3,000 a month.\nThe deal underscores how suburban Chicago has become a magnet for large-scale trades in recent months. A development slowdown has buoyed rents, making the metro the No. 2 market in the U.S. for rent growth, according to CoStar. That rent strength fueled a string of blockbuster sales late last year, including a record $148 million deal for the 352-unit E2 in Evanston, a $109 million trade for Naperville\u2019s 417-unit Railway Plaza, and a $101 million-plus sale of the 306-unit Wheaton 121.\n\nSo far this year, investors have poured $2.4 billion into Chicago-area multifamily, compared with $3.9 billion for all of last year, a figure boosted by the late-2024 flurry. The Vernon Hills acquisition shows momentum hasn\u2019t cooled, even as the development pipeline shrinks.\nMesirow is doubling down on multifamily. The firm announced in May it had raised $1.25 billion for a new national apartment fund, a 66 percent increase, with plans to target top-tier markets across the U.S.\nTLC\nhas been equally aggressive. In addition to the Vernon Hills pickup, it recently paid $60 million for the 192-unit Top of the Mount in\nMount Prospect\n, adding to a sprawling suburban portfolio.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The projects are still early, but Ersa Grae Principal Reza Ebrahimi said the firm hopes to deliver lots at the Riley Road tract within a year, with home construction on the FM 1488 parcel following within two years.\nThe communities are expected to feature 50- and 60-foot lots. No builders have been selected, though the firm will likely tap two or three familiar partners for each site, Ebrahimi told the outlet.\nThe plans add fuel to a submarket already seeing massive new supply. Nearby, Airia Development Company is underway on Colton, a 5,700-acre, 11,000-home master-planned community east of the Riley tract. The Texas market for homes in master-planned communities ranks\nsecond\nonly to Florida.\n\nElsewhere on the edges of the metro, Signiorelli and D.R. Horton are planning a 1,000-home community in\nrural\nFort Bend County.\nErsa Grae, founded by the late Ali Ebrahimi after fleeing Iran in the 1980s, has been a longtime player in Texas land development, delivering master-planned projects such as Silver Ranch, Falcon Ranch and StoneCreek Estates. The firm is also working on a community in Brookshire, west of Houston.\nWaller County, which is adjacent to\nMontgomery County\n, has become a magnet for developers chasing demand from buyers priced out of closer-in Houston suburbs. Population growth and new infrastructure have fueled steady lot absorption. Ersa Grae said its projects will be positioned to catch that wave.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Midtown, especially around Grand Central, is booming. But not for everyone.\nThe ground lease for the office building at 1140 Sixth Avenue has seen a massive valuation drop to the tune of 90 percent; it was appraised at $180 million in 2016, and today it\u2019s worth just $17.8 million, according to Morningstar Credit.\nThe value per square foot, at $70, is cheaper than it once was to\nlease\nat the location. In 2012, the landlord\nasked $85 per square foot\nto rent.\nThe drop is startling considering that the neighborhood has generally done well post-pandemic. But the owner, American Strategic Investment Co., has been strapped for cash and losing tenants.\nThe 20-story building was constructed in 1931, according to tax records. Private equity giant Blackstone purchased a defaulted loan on the ground lease for about $100 million. The owner set upon a $40 million renovation.\n\nThat investment paid off. The firm\nsold the interest\nto American Strategic Investment Co. in 2016 for $180 million. The company was then called American Realty Capital\u2019s New York City REIT.\nIn the summer of 2016, the company took out $99 million in loans for the building. But occupancy fell quickly. By 2019, it fell from 91 percent at underwriting to 79 percent, according to Morningstar Credit. At its lowest, in 2021, the building was more than 30 percent vacant.\nNet operating income also took a hit. Once $9.5 million in 2016, it was just $1.6 million in 2023. The biggest tenant in the building is currently City National Bank, which occupies 14 percent of the space. The bank signed a lease until 2033, but at a reduced rent. The second largest tenant, a coworking space operator, received a rent abatement through part of 2024, according to Fitch Ratings. The ground lease payment is $4.75 million per year.\nOwnership hasn\u2019t made a dent in its outstanding balance, with an effective interest rate of 9.1 percent, according to the latest federal financial filing. The loan was transferred to special servicing in April. The servicer\nfiled for foreclosure in June\n, saying the owner doesn\u2019t have the funds to carry the ground lease and has agreed to cooperate. Loan documents entitled the lender to receiver in the event of default, and a judge approved in July.\nNeither special servicer LNR Partners nor American Strategic Realty Co immediately responded to a request for comment.\n",

        "content": "Some people lose money on real estate because they know nothing about it, others because they know too much.\nAn example of the first group would be New Yorkers who purchased Hamptons homes from a former taxi business operator named Michael O\u2019Sullivan, who had bought them in foreclosure but failed to pay off the delinquent mortgages.\nIn some cases, a lender would later force a foreclosure auction, leading to a nightmare scenario in which the winning bidder knocks on the door and tells the unfortunate residents that he is now the rightful owner.\nNewsday just published an\nextensive piece\nabout O\u2019Sullivan and his pathetic buyers, many of whom were Latino immigrants and spent six figures on renovations before discovering they had been misled.\nThe article began with a woman who put down $75,000 toward a $475,000 purchase of an East Hampton home, spent $100,000 making it habitable and then discovered an outstanding mortgage of $619,500.\nIn a traditional home purchase, the buyer obtains title insurance from a company that guarantees the title is clear. Buyers also typically hire a real estate lawyer to go over the contract, which in O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s deals was often filled with red flags.\nA basic internet search for \u201cHow to buy a home\u201d would quickly spell this out for anyone new to the process. O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s customers could have avoided disaster by Googling \u201chow to buy a home in foreclosure.\u201d\nI don\u2019t mean to blame the victims. Many spoke little or no English. Several said they trusted O\u2019Sullivan, who called his company Hamptons Dream Properties, because they were referred to him by Lourdes Alban, a Spanish-speaking real estate agent.\nAlban later left Saunders &amp; Associates for Nest Seekers International in Bridgehampton. Nest Seekers\u2019 Geoff Gifkins told Newsday it is \u201creviewing the situation and gathering the facts before we rush to judgment.\u201d\nOne question the brokerage should ask Alban: Would you buy a home from O\u2019Sullivan without doing a title search?\nAlban told reporter Jonathan LaMantia, a former colleague of mine, that she \u201cdid not work with [O\u2019Sullivan] at all.\u201d That is not the same as saying she never referred potential homebuyers to him.\nThe second type of duped real estate investor is someone who thinks he knows what he\u2019s doing but doesn\u2019t, such as people who funded ventures through the crowdfunding site\nYieldstreet\n. Another journalist I worked with, Hiten Samtani, quoted one burned investor in his newsletter,\nThe Promote\n:\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a day that goes by without me saying, \u2018I can\u2019t believe what happened,\u2019 Justin Klish, who invested $300K in the\nFlow project\nvia Yieldstreet, told CNBC. \u201cI consider myself moderately financially savvy, and I got duped by this company.\u201d\nA truly savvy investor would assume that people raising money on crowdfunding platforms probably could not get traditional financing because their ventures were problematic.\n\nA lot of venture capitalists have put money into crowdfunding platforms \u2014 that is, into the platforms themselves. I would like to know how many of these VCs have also invested in the risky schemes raising money on these same platforms. I bet it\u2019s a very short list.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nAre problems such as neglected repairs,\nuncollected maintenance fees\n, self-dealing and financial malfeasance more likely to occur at\nHDFC\n(permanently affordable) co-ops or at traditional co-ops? Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: Google Maps sometimes pins the wrong location for an address, but will correct mistakes if users report them. I discovered this upon checking Google\u2019s photo of\n960 Franklin Avenue\nin Brooklyn, which was once a spice factory, then an empty lot and now is a condo construction site. It was never an apartment building with a fire escape, which is what Google Maps showed. That building turned out to be on Washington Avenue, on the other side of the block. Here\u2019s the corrected version:\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 Contenders for the three downstate casino licenses are nearing the end of the road, with the next hurdle being community advisory committees,\nGothamist\nreported. These committees hold immense power to advance or sink bids.\n\u2014 Mayor Eric Adams is once again suing the Campaign Finance Board over its denying him millions of dollars in public matching funds, according to\nThe City\n. This is his second suit. His first was dismissed in May by a judge who upheld the board\u2019s concerns over the integrity of Adams\u2019 fundraising.\n\u2014 Given Andrew Cuomo\u2019s means-testing housing proposal last week, following Zohran Mamdani\u2019s pledge to freeze the rent of rent-stabilized units,\nCity &amp; State\nbroke down New York City housing units by type. According to the New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey, of the 3,705,000 units counted, market-rate led the stock with 1,119,000. Coming in a close second were rent-stabilized units with 960,700.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Tuesday was\n$7.25 million\nfor a 2,829-square-foot condominium unit at The Belnord, 225 West 86th Street on the Upper West Side.\nCorcoran\u2019s Kirsten Jordan\nhad the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$205 million\nfor the 129,231-square-foot office building at 510 West 22nd Street in Chelsea.\nThe Real Deal\nreported\nin May on Vornado Realty Trust\u2019s sale to MKF Group.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$27 million\nfor a 12,270-square-foot house at 247 Central Park West on the Upper West Side.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for a proposed 19,865-square-foot, 34-unit residential property at 1537 Vyse Avenue in Crotona Park East. Leandro Dickson filed the permit on behalf of Gedalya Feldman.\n\u2014 Matthew Elo",

        "content": "Seaport Entertainment Group is taking a haircut on the development site for the controversial Seaport Tower.\nTavros Capital is in contract to purchase the site at 250 Water Street for $150.5 million from Seaport Entertainment Group,\nBisnow\nreported. This is an about-face for the seller, which last year spun off from Howard Hughes Holding in a deal backed by billionaire Bill Ackman, after it sunk $220 million into the purchase and air rights and spent years tied up in legal wrangling over the site.\nSEG President and CEO Anton Nikodemus said in a statement that the sale would \u201csupport new sustainable growth opportunities and create long-term value for our shareholders.\u201d\nHoward Hughes bought the site for $180 million in 2018 after the previous owner, the Milstein family, repeatedly failed to secure building approval. Hughes pledged to pay $40 million for 234,630 square feet of\nair rights\nfor the South Street Seaport Museum, and shortly after that got building approval. But this deal soon became a point of contention.\nIn 2022, the South Street Seaport Coalition, a community preservation group, filed a lawsuit challenging the Landmark Preservation Commission\u2019s approval. A judge\nvoided that approval\nin 2023, citing the air rights deal as\u00a0 \u201cimpermissible quid pro quo\u201d between the developer and the Landmarks Preservation Commission. That decision was\nreversed\nabout six months later and the court declined to hear an appeal from the preservationist group, allowing the developer to\nfinally proceed\nwith construction.\n\nThe firm cleared another hurdle when the 421a construction completion deadline was extended to 2031, allowing the development to receive the crucial tax abatement it needed for the deal, which included 399 units with 100 designated affordable, to pencil out.\nNevertheless, SEG\nannounced\nits intention to sell the site back in March. JLL\u2019s Andrew Scandalios, Ethan Stanton and Nicco Lupo represented the firm in this deal, which is expected to close before the end of the year.\nNearby, the firm\nrecently signed\na 20 year, 75,000 square foot lease with immersive art exhibitor Meow Wolf at Pier 17.\n\u2013 Quinn Waller\n",

        "content": "Miami-Dade Property Appraiser Tomas Regalado is seeking higher market valuations for a handful of signature properties and development sites in the county.\nDuring a two-day span of July 29 and July 30, the property appraiser\u2019s office filed separate lawsuits in Miami-Dade Circuit Court against 17 owners that scored reductions in their properties\u2019 market values in 2024, which in turn led to lower property tax bills.\nSome of the defendants include affiliates of New York-based investment giant\nBlackstone\n, Indianapolis-based national shopping mall owner\nSimon Property Group\n, Miami-based cruise line Royal Caribbean Group and San Francisco-based industrial real estate investment firm\nPrologis\n. Regalado\u2019s office is also suing affiliates of KAR Properties, Alex Vadia\u2019s Midtown Development,\nSwire Properties\n,\nMelo Group\nand RER Ventures that own seven separate development sites in Miami-Dade.\nThe practice of seeking to redo market valuations for trophy properties and development sites via litigation began under Regalado\u2019s predecessor, Pedro Garcia, who was Miami-Dade Property Appraiser from 2008 until 2024. In a phone interview, Regalado said he\u2019s not as aggressive as Garcia.\n\u201cLast year, my predecessor filed 65 cases,\u201d\nRegalado\ntold\nThe Real Deal\n. \u201cWe only filed 17 this year. The bottom line is that we are diminishing the number of cases that this agency used to file.\u201d\nStill, the 17 property owners his office is suing \u201cgot a huge discount,\u201d and \u201cthey should not have received that kind of reduction,\u201d Regalado said. His staff had already begun negotiating settlements with 10 owners prior to the lawsuits being filed, he added.\nShahab Karmely, CEO of\nKAR Properties\n, was the only defendant who responded to requests for comment from\nTRD\n. Regalado\u2019s office is suing two KAR affiliates that own a Miami River assemblage in the city\u2019s Brickell neighborhood.\nIn general, property appraisers across the nation often overestimate the value of development sites, Karmely told\nTRD\n. \u201cWe have this unfortunate pattern where the value of raw land that produces no income is arbitrarily increased,\u201d Karmely said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that can be mathematically justified.\u201d\nFor instance, property appraisers take into account what can be developed on the land, but don\u2019t factor in rising interest rates and construction costs, high inflation and the fact that new construction starts have slowed.\n\u201cEvery year that passes, they are like, \u2018We are going to tax you more,\u2019\u201d Karmely said. \u201cWe have all these headwinds, but somehow these parcels are worth more. I wish that was the case, but it is not.\u201d\nRegalado said he agrees with Karmely, but the property market value haircuts provided by the Miami-Dade Value Adjustment Board to the 17 owners went too far. Still, he has instructed the property appraiser\u2019s legal staff to work out settlements, Regalado said.\n\u201cMy commitment is to make sure that our team looks at a property\u2019s income, looks at market conditions and tries to settle cases for the benefit of the owners,\u201d Regalado said. \u201cAnd if they prevail in court, we\u2019re going to respect the decision. We will not appeal at all.\u201d\nHere are the properties that are targeted in the property appraiser\u2019s lawsuits:\nCruise Terminal A, 2000 North Cruise Boulevard, Miami\nAn affiliate of Royal Caribbean and London-based investment firm Icon Infrastructure that owns the cruise ship terminal allegedly obtained an incorrect reduction in the property\u2019s market value from $68.8 million to $53.7 million, the property appraiser\u2019s lawsuit states. The affiliate also allegedly incorrectly received a reduced taxable value of zero dollars from the Miami-Dade County Value Adjustment Board.\nDolphin Mall, 11401 Northwest 12th Street, Sweetwater\n\nTwo affiliates of Simon Property Group that own the 1.4 million-square-foot\nDolphin Mall\nallegedly obtained an incorrect reduction in the property\u2019s market value from $603 million to $500 million, according to the property appraiser\u2019s lawsuit.\nBlackstone\u2019s Miami-Dade portfolio\nAn affiliate of\nBlackstone\nand its industrial subsidiary, Link Logistics, that owns 21 industrial sites in the county, mostly in Doral, allegedly obtained an incorrect reduction in the market value of the properties from a combined $549.6 million to $460 million, according to the property appraiser\u2019s lawsuit.\nMidtown Development sites, 110 Northeast 36th Street and 3055 North Miami Avenue, Miami\nThe property appraiser\u2019s lawsuit states that an affiliate of Vadia\u2019s Midtown Development that owns a 3.5-acre vacant site at 110 Northeast 36th Street allegedly obtained an incorrect reduction in the property\u2019s market value from\u00a0 $73.7 million to $42 million. The site is currently used as a green space adjacent to the Target at Midtown Miami\u2019s retail center.\nAnother Midtown Development affiliate that owns a nearly 5-acre site at 3055 North Miami Avenue allegedly obtained an incorrect reduction in the property\u2019s market value from $95.1 million to $54.2 million, the property appraiser\u2019s lawsuit states. Midtown is partnering with Carlo Rosso\u2019s Rosso Development to build the\nMidtown Park\nmixed-use project, which will also include the 28-story, 288-unit Midtown Park Residences by Proper condo tower.\n2.8-acre development site, 700-799 Brickell Avenue, Miami\nAn affiliate of Swire Properties that previously owned a 2.8-acre development site at 700-799 Brickell Avenue allegedly obtained an incorrect reduction in the property\u2019s market value from $98.8 million to $67.9 million, according to the property appraiser\u2019s lawsuit. Swire abandoned plans for a supertall office building, and in May the firm sold the site to Miami-based Melo Group for more than\n$200 million\n.\nAria Reserve development site, 711 Northeast 23rd Terrace, Miami\nAn affiliate of Melo Group that owns the 5-acre development site in Miami\u2019s Edgewater neighborhood allegedly obtained an incorrect reduction in the property\u2019s market value from $81.6 million to $66.3 million, according to the property appraiser\u2019s lawsuit. Melo Group is planning to develop the property into\nAria Reserve\n, a two-tower project with 800 condos.\nFaena Residences development site, 90 Southwest Third Street, Miami\nAffiliates of KAR Properties that own a Miami River assemblage allegedly obtained an incorrect reduction in the property\u2019s market value from $55 million to $39.2 million, according to the property appraiser\u2019s lawsuit. KAR is partnering with Fortune International Group and Alan Faena to develop\nFaena Residences\n, a two-tower project with 440 condos.\nRER Ventures development sites in Coral Gables and Kendall\nAn affiliate of Miami-based RER that owns a 2-acre development site in Coral Gables and a 0.8-acre lot in Kendall allegedly obtained an incorrect reduction in the properties\u2019 market value from $46.2 million to $6.5 million, the property appraiser\u2019s lawsuit states.\nWarehouse, 3760 West 108th Street, Hialeah\nAn affiliate of Prologis that owns a two-story warehouse in Hialeah allegedly obtained an incorrect reduction in the property\u2019s market value from $78.7 million to $53.9 million, according to the property appraiser\u2019s lawsuit.",

        "content": "Cain International and OKO Group\u00a0got the green light from the Beverly Hills City Council in the wee hours of Wednesday morning to designate a Community Facilities District that could allow One Beverly Hills\nto receive up to $550 million\n\u2014 twice the city\u2019s annual operating budget \u2014 in bond financing.\nThe council would still have to approve future bond issuance within the specific area, which the developers of the mixed-use project expect to seek closer to the project\u2019s 2028 completion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good deal for One Beverly Hills,\u201d Vice Mayor John A. Mirisch, who voted against the project in 2021, said at the meeting, which started at 7 p.m. on Tuesday. He added, \u201cNow I do feel very comfortable that this is a good deal for the city.\u201d\nOf the $550 million, $390 million would be used to fund public improvements and $160 million would be allocated for \u201cfuture city council to fund major repairs or enhancements to the public improvements decade from now without needing to revisit voter approvals,\u201d according to a council staff presentation at the meeting.\nThe special taxes would be levied on properties within the 17.5-acre project site at 9850, 9876, 9900 and 9988 Wilshire Boulevard between Wilshire Boulevard and Santa Monica Boulevard, slated to include an Aman resort, two condominium towers and the renovation of the neighboring Beverly Hilton hotel. The revenue would then be used to repay the bonds.\n\u201cThe CFDs really act like takeout financing,\u201d Larry Green, managing director at Cain, said at the meeting. \u201cIt is not a gift or a subsidy. There is no financial risk to the city, and there is no impact to the existing taxpayers outside of the CFD.\u201d\nCain International and OKO Group are targeting 177 Aman-branded residences, of which 20 are under contract, the project\u2019s representatives said at the council meeting.\n\nOne Beverly Hills, which is already under construction, also calls for 4 acres of open space reserved for condo residents and 4.5 acres open to the public. Amenities include a conference center, retail and dining space.\nCFDs were established by the state\u2019s Mello-Roos Act of 1982. They are formed when property owners in a geographic area agree to impose a tax on property to fund infrastructure improvements or services.\n\u201cCFD is a tool that\u2019s customarily used for this type of investment, and it allows us to borrow this money and refinance these improvements at a lower rate than what we could get through a traditional loan,\u201d Green said.\nEarlier this year, Cain and OKO\nsecured $300 million in mezzanine financing\nfor the project from Vici Properties. In 2024, they reportedly nabbed\n$2 billion in financing\nfrom a group of lenders led by a $500 million senior loan from JP Morgan.\nOne Beverly Hills was approved by the City Council in 2021. The developers announced the groundbreaking in February 2024 and the project is expected to be completed in 2028.\nThe site was\nonce occupied\nby a Robinsons-May department store and gas station.\n",

        "content": "Just over halfway through Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s term, he\u2019s facing major political headwinds with a recent approval rating of 25 percent and potential candidates already circling to challenge him in the 2026 primary.\nThe city\u2019s real estate market has been a mixed bag over the course of what could be the mayor\u2019s only term,\nleading the country in rent growth\nwhile landing close to the bottom in rankings of construction activity, recent studies have shown.\nSo what does the real estate community think of Johnson? The sentiment isn\u2019t much rosier than his poll numbers. And his performance so far could foreshadow some pitfalls that the similarly progressive New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani might face if elected this fall.\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a heck of an uphill battle against him,\u201d Chicago-based LG Group founder and CEO Brian Goldberg said of Johnson.\nHigh-stakes fights over\na transfer tax\nand\nan anti-gentrification ordinance\nsoured relations between the industry and Johnson\u2019s administration while some YIMBY-friendly wins have gotten overshadowed.\nBut not all of the blame for the city\u2019s development stagnation can be placed squarely on the mayor, which players like Goldberg acknowledge.\nInvestors and lenders have been getting cold feet because of\na chaotic property tax system\nrun by Cook County, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development recently\ndropped an investigation\ninto the longstanding practice of aldermanic prerogative, an unwritten policy that has been blamed for slow housing progress for decades.\nThe Real Deal\nresearched several policies and interviewed a selection of real estate professionals and the Deputy Mayor of Economic Development to score the effectiveness of the administration\u2019s real estate-related efforts so far.\nRead through the scorecard or jump to a policy of interest here.\nEliminating parking minimums - A\nNorthwest Side Housing Preservation Ordinance - D\nA $1.25 billion affordable housing and economic development bond - B\nReal Estate Transfer Tax - F\nCut The Tape permitting efficiency campaign - C\nSubsidies for office-to-resi conversions - B\nProposal to allow ADUs citywide - B\n1. Eliminating parking minimums\nThe policy:\nIn a win for developers, City Council passed an ordinance that eliminates minimum parking requirements in much of the city.\nThe ordinance expanded developers\u2019 ability to forgo parking anywhere in the city that is served by public transit, including in residential neighborhoods. Parking minimums still apply in non-transit served areas but developers can request exceptions.\nThe ordinance was originally proposed by Alderman Daniel La Spata and backed by the Mayor.\nReal Estate POV:\nReducing parking requirements has been tested successfully in other cities as a way to increase density while reducing development costs and some in Chicago are taking notice of the change.\n\u201cConstruction lenders will be able to get more aggressive with pricing and more deals will pencil out,\u201d said Alex Cohen, an associate with Interra Realty.\nThe administration\u2019s take:\nThe new parking policy is part of a broader goal to increase density throughout the city.\n\u201cParking may not seem as sexy but it can create additional density, as well as shave off some of the costs that developers have,\u201d said Deputy Mayor of Economic Development Kenya Merritt.\nGrade: A\nThe policy is an evidenced-backed way to increase density and ultimately housing supply which is a win for developers and politicians alike. Now the ball is in the real estate community\u2019s court to test the process out. If tweaks to the policy are needed, they\u2019ll be less substantial and easier to implement than the initial ordinance.\n2. Northwest Side Housing Preservation Ordinance\nThe Policy:\nWhen two Alderman\nmade an about-face on an anti-gentrification pilot program\non the Northwest side, it signaled a growing hesitancy to follow through with more progressive real estate policies.\nThe Northwest Side Housing Preservation Ordinance, which was developed by a group of Aldemen, created a pilot area in parts of Logan Square, Avondale, Hermosa, Humboldt Park, West Town and Pilsen. In it, tenants were given the right of first refusal if a landlord sells a building and existing demolition fees were increased for developers seeking to replace multi-unit buildings with single family homes.\nThe area lost 6 percent of its two- to six-flat buildings between 2013 and 2018, according to the DePaul Institute for Housing Studies.\nBut after outcry from longtime property owners, city council later voted to remove parts of the 31st and 36th wards from the pilot area.\nReal Estate POV:\nThe anti-gentrification ordinance often gets cited as a dividing line between real estate players and the administration in general, even though it didn\u2019t originate from the mayor\u2019s office.\n\u201cIt affects people that have owned homes here for years and years when Logan Square was a lot rougher,\u201d Sotheby\u2019s broker Joe Freeman said. \u201cThe hoops and obstacles you have to go around with that ordinance before you sell a property are pretty insane.\u201d\nThe administration\u2019s take:\nMerritt pointed to $8 billion worth of projects that have advanced through the city\u2019s Planning Commission so far this year as evidence that the city\u2019s policies are not having a chilling effect on overall growth and investment.\n\u201cWe recognize that business and driving our economy can happen in an equitable way, and so far, we\u2019ve been able to realize that. Those two things can live and exist at the same time,\u201d Meritt said.\nGrade: D\nThe mayor was not a vocal supporter or detractor of the ordinance but staying on the sidelines cost him an opportunity to shore up political capital with people on either side of the debate.\n3. A $1.25 billion affordable housing and economic development bond\nThe policy:\nA $1.25 billion bond\naimed at funding affordable housing was a hallmark of Johnson\u2019s campaign. Unlike some of his other high-profile proposals, this one earned the endorsement of industry groups like Illinois Realtors.\nSince it passed in 2024, the bond has funded the creation of a city-run revolving loan fund for affordable housing known as the Green Social Housing program and\nsubsidies for developers\nbuilding housing on vacant lots known as the Missing Middle program.\nReal Estate POV:\nThe bond program\u2019s payoff\nrelies on the expiration of most TIF\nor Tax increment financing districts.\nTIF districts allow developers to use property tax revenue generated by a project to offset certain infrastructure costs. In some areas they have set off a wave of new projects while in others they have failed to entice developers. They\u2019ve also been criticized for siphoning taxes away from entities like Chicago Public Schools.\nIndustry groups like Illinois Realtors were okay with the city phasing out certain TIFs to fund the bond but other players worry about the impact of losing access to the tool. About 40 percent of the city\u2019s TIF district are set to expire in the next three years and city finance officials have said extensions will be considered on a case-by-base basis.\n\u201cIs nobody using it because developers don\u2019t need it or is nobody using it because the people who need it don\u2019t know it exists, or know how to access it?\u201d said Corey Oliver, CEO of Community Venture Investment Corp.\nOthers question whether the city can boost affordable housing as cost-effectively as private developers can, given the extra scrutiny the city places on publicly-backed projects.\n\u201cThe only restrictions should be that they pass inspections and that everything is done according to code,\u201d South Side Builders Association President Andy Schcolnik said. \u201cBut they create this race where it\u2019s impossible to get to the finish line.\u201d\nThe administration\u2019s take:\nThe bond\u2019s approach to promoting housing comes in two forms: a pilot program funding direct grants of up to $150,000 for developers repurposing vacant lots and a revolving loan fund for mixed-income housing projects. Both bring down construction costs for developers more than if the developer had relied on the Federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program instead, Merrit said.\n\u201c[LIHTC] certainly comes with a lot of requirements that are imposed by the federal government in terms of how you implement the affordability portion of it and so that drives up the cost per unit,\u201d Meritt said. \u201cBut when you think about other other models, like our Missing Middle program or what we\u2019re going to be doing with Green Social Housing, those costs per unit are more in alignment with what you\u2019ll see in the private market.\u201d\n\nGrade:\nB\nPassing the bond was a major feat but deploying the funds efficiently to help re-fill the city\u2019s development pipeline will determine its success. Plus, the full impact of phasing out TIF hasn\u2019t been felt yet.\n4. The Transfer Tax\nThe policy:\nPerhaps the most controversial plan to come out of the mayor\u2019s office so far was a proposed increase to the transfer tax on property sales over $1 million which was dubbed the \u201cBring Chicago Home,\u201d initiative.\nThe tax, which was sent to a citywide vote in March 2024,\nwas defeated at the ballot box\nin part thanks to\na well-funded opposition campaign\nled by industry groups like Illinois Realtors and the Neighborhood Building Owners Association.\nReal Estate POV:\nFunding from the tax was going to be used to address homelessness, although critics questioned if the plan was detailed enough to warrant support.\n\u201cHow are you going to use this transfer tax to actually house the homeless? It was just a lackadaisical plan, and I think he shot for the moon and landed in the mountains,\u201d Freeman said.\nAdditionally, at a time when construction starts are at historic lows and institutional lenders are sitting on the sidelines, opponents to the plan argued it would stifle economic growth in the city.\n\u201cA lot of people who have money in Chicago have had it in their family for generations \u2026 a lot of people would have stayed in their spot for a long time until that mansion tax would have been repealed,\u201d Freeman said.\nThe administration\u2019s take:\nThe city\u2019s policies thread the needle of enticing investment and promoting equity, Merrit said.\n\u201cThe city is open for business, we\u2019re just not for sale,\u201d Meritt said, quoting Johnson. \u201cWe\u2019ve put in place policies, initiatives and practices that demonstrate that we are pro-business, that we are pro-development.\u201d\nGrade: F\nFor some players, the transfer tax fight cemented an \u201cus-against-them\u201d mentality between the industry and the administration. Even developer-friendly wins passed after the transfer tax vote have been cast in a negative light by skeptics. Proponents of the tax feel let down by the vote and for both sides of the debate, perception is reality.\n5. The Cut The Tape campaign\nThe policy:\nOne of the mayor\u2019s earliest priorities was issuing an executive order to streamline processes for approving both residential and commercial building projects. The program, known as the,\n\u201cCut The Tape\u201d campaign\n, targeted 14 different departments.\nReal Estate POV:\nMany developers\nidentified little meaningful change\nin how long it takes to get shovels in the ground, especially for affordable housing projects.\n\u201cThe mayor\u2019s Cut The Red Tape campaign was a facade and lip service,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cThe new Planning Commissioner, Ciere Boatright, and some of the staff changes there have been significantly better and more efficient than past administrations but I can\u2019t necessarily credit Brandon Johnson.\u201d\nThe same sentiment applies to rehabs, Schcolnik said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a steeple chase \u2026 you\u2019ve got to be jumping through hoops all the time,\u201d he said.\nThe administration\u2019s take:\nIn a one-year review of the program, Boatright said the Plan Commission has cut review timelines from 135 to 79 days and her department has accelerated rezoning and land disposition, moving more than 1,000 properties toward new uses.\nGrade: C\nChanges are happening. Whether they\u2019re happening fast enough or who can take all the credit for them is open for debate but the city has committed to continuing to make changes based on feedback from developers.\n6. Subsidies for office-to-resi conversions\nThe policy:\nOne of real estate\u2019s early wins during Johnon\u2019s term came when he decided\nto continue a program to subsidize office-to-residential conversions\nalong LaSalle Street that was originally proposed by his predecessor, Lori Lightfoot. Johnson had initially put the program, known as LaSalle Street Reimagined, on hold but as office foreclosures continued to surge and the city\u2019s vacancy rate remained stuck above 25 percent, the administration picked up where Lightfoot left off.\nTo apply for the program, developers must set aside 30 percent of the units in their project as affordable. So far, six projects totalling over 1,800 units have been approved and the first one broke ground at 79 West Monroe in March.\nThe city-backed projects alone will convert nearly 2 million square feet of office space into residences. While helpful, CBRE found the central business district alone has 40 million square feet of vacant office space as of the second quarter of 2025.\nReal Estate POV:\nGoldberg said he is happy that money is getting set aside for the program but questions whether its impact will be limited to LaSalle Street. Goldberg\u2019s firm LG Group led an office-to-residential conversion at 330 South Wells years before LaSalle Street Reimagined took effect but it recently ran into trouble when it was\nhit with a $27 million foreclosure\nthis June.\n\u201cThis amount of money, applied to only a few projects, is meaningful to those projects specifically and will not have much of an impact on such a large expanse of dense urban city space,\u201d Goldberg said.\nThe administration\u2019s take:\nSince approving the six initial projects funded by the program, the upcoming subsidized conversions have spurred a wave of eight new privately-funded conversion proposals, Merritt said.\n\u201cNow we have a total of 14 projects downtown that are taking vacant commercial space and pivoting it to residential, creating density and making our downtown a neighborhood.\u201d she said.\nGrade: B\nAny effort to reduce office space and create more housing is a win for the loop and the fact that both subsidized and non-subsidized projects are moving forward shows the program is working as intended. The overall impact on the downtown vacancy rate will be an important metric in evaluating the program\u2019s success in the future.\n7. Allowing ADUs\nThe policy:\nChicago is reviving a citywide plan to legalize coach houses and other accessory dwelling units, a move that could reshape residential density rules \u2014 and reignite political tensions \u2014 across the city.\nA proposal currently making its way through City Hall\nwould remove zoning restrictions that have prohibited ADUs on many lots citywide since the 1950s. A pilot program was instated in 2021 with mixed results.\nReal Estate POV:\nIndustry players welcome the idea of expanding ADU zoning but question its overall impact.\n\u201cI know a lot of my North Side colleagues like the ADU program and they felt like the expansion of it was necessary for us on the South Side,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cBut we have other headaches and issues here when we\u2019re looking at sustainable development.\u201d\nThe administration\u2019s take:\nADUs will compliment the city\u2019s density goals, but will not be the only solution city leaders pursue.\n\u201cThe mayor is driving us to create a wide swath of options for people where people can live and ADUs gives us the ability to do just that,\u201d Merritt said.\nGrade: B\nChanging zoning to allow more density is an important way to spur development and bring housing costs down, but policies allowing ADUs in other areas of Chicago and across the U.S. have had mixed results so far.\n",

        "content": "The Chicago Bears\u2019 new head coach is settling into Halas Hall as well as Lake Forest\u2019s luxury housing market.\nBen Johnson and his wife, Jessica, dropped $3.25 million, or $522 per square foot, in March on a 6,200-square-foot mansion a short drive from the team\u2019s headquarters, the Chicago Tribune\nreported\n. Johnson, who came over at the beginning of this year from the Detroit Lions after three years as offensive coordinator, bought the six-bedroom home, at 922 Oak Knoll Drive, via a land trust that concealed the couple\u2019s identity.\nBuilt in 2013, the property mixes classic North Shore grandeur with modern perks: 10-foot ceilings, radiant-heated floors in every bathroom, a walnut-paneled office, expansive mudroom and a kitchen with high-end appliances, as well as a spiral staircase.\nThe lower level packs in entertainment features \u2014 a theater room, rec room with a wood bar, and a gym. The 2.5-acre lot boasts a sports court, bluestone patio, outdoor fireplace and built-in grill. A three-car garage with radiant heating and copper-trimmed roofline completes the package.\n\nThe sellers listed the home in February for $3.35 million and struck a deal with the Johnsons in just five days. Compass agent Ellen Chukerman represented the buyers. Meanwhile, the couple is exiting Michigan: their four-bedroom home in Plymouth, listed in July for $1.1 million, is under contract.\nJohnson isn\u2019t the first Bears coach to plant roots in Lake County\u2019s high-end\nenclaves\n. His predecessor, Matt Eberflus, bought an 11,300-square-foot lakefront estate in Lake Bluff for $3.9 million in 2022, a year before he was fired and picked up by the Dallas Cowboys as defensive coordinator.\nLake Forest and its neighboring towns have long been favored by Bears brass for their proximity to Halas Hall and stock of sprawling\nmansions\n.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Once postponed, the zoning case is rescheduled no earlier than four weeks later.\nThe vote highlighted a rift between the council and\ncity staff\n. Mayor Eric Johnson has made it a priority to simplify development, and the City Plan Commission and the Zoning Ordinance Advisory Committee recommended that the council end the ordinance. As one resident who testified against the amendment put it, \u201cit\u2019s very clear that cutting red tape for developers is job number one\u201d for the mayor and staff.\nA delayed zoning case can stunt developments. Assistant City Manager Robin Bentley called the amendment an improvement for \u201cprocedural efficiency\u201d in a memo.\nOn the other hand, proponents of the existing code called it their last resort against unwanted development.\n\nThe city council will review a presentation this week on Dallas Zoning Reform, a broad platform also backed by the mayor and city staff.\nThe plan aims to trim outdated zoning rules, clarify the development process and diversify Dallas\u2019 residential stock. Few concrete suggestions are public, but the\npresentation\ngestures to allowing accessory dwelling units by right, eliminating special use permit renewal requirements and protecting the character of existing single-family neighborhoods.\nThe city expects to send drafted code changes to the city council for consideration early next year.\nThe Dallas City Council also\napproved\na zoning plan for\nWest Oak Cliff\nlast week that will facilitate small multifamily and retail development in a 35-acre district centered on Hampton Road and Clarendon Drive.\n",

Colo Development Partners is the co-developer, and Harmony Bank is providing financing/\nThe property, rising at 260 West Mulberry Street, is near Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, the University of North Texas and Texas Woman\u2019s University. Just off the Denton Downtown Square, the development will span 120,000 square feet and is set to deliver in the second quarter of next year. Pre-leasing is scheduled to begin early next year. Units will range from 481 to 1,246 square feet, with more than half designed to include home offices, a nod to the hybrid work era. Planned amenities include a clubhouse, gym, study areas and pet-friendly features.\nArchon Corporation is designing the complex, and Westwood Residential will handle leasing and management.\nLunsford is best known for large-scale industrial development, including Denton Point Business Park. It also develops office, retail and institutional projects, and the firm offers commercial tenant representation and property management services.\n\nWith\nHL Communities\n, the company plans to pursue three product types: boutique infill like the Denton project, suburban garden-style projects near job hubs and wrap developments that pair structured parking with high-density housing.\nThe timing could prove favorable. While the DFW region has been flooded with multifamily supply \u2014 developers delivered more than 40,000 units through mid-2025 \u2014 the pipeline is thinning. Units under construction have dropped by about 17,000 year-over-year, and Colliers projects that number could fall to fewer than 18,000 by next year. Occupancy in Class A properties has already tightened back to 95 percent, and average rents edged up last quarter to $1,503.\nWith the Dallas Fort-Worth Metroplex\nadding\nmore than 480 people per day through births and migration, Managing principal Hayden Lunsford said the bet is on staying power.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Jeff Krasnoff\u2019s special servicing giant Rialto Capital put the landlords of some South Loop retail in its crosshairs.\nThe owner of the retail spaces at the base of two Michigan Avenue condo towers are facing an $11 million foreclosure lawsuit brought by Rialto on behalf of bondholders in a securitized loan offering.\nNew York investor Steven Waldman\u2019s Crowd Realty Advisors owns the first-floor retail space for the condo buildings at 1400 and 1250 South Michigan. Waldman and Austin-based investor James R. Gatlin are guarantors of Crowd Realty\u2019s purchase, which was bought from the condo buildings\u2019 developer Russland Capital in 2015.\nA\nfundraising brochure\nfrom the time of Crowd Realty\u2019s purchase shows the firm sought accredited investors to buy into the property. Crowd Realty sought to raise $12.2 million, with $4.4 million in equity and $7.8 million in debt.\nWhile the South Loop retail market is considered a little quieter than the River North scene on the other side of the Loop, its struggles have been less high-profile than the nearly 30 percent vacancy rates posted on the Magnificent Mile in the wake of the pandemic.\nHowever, there have been multiple rough patches for South Loop retail landlords, including just to the north of Waldman\u2019s property at 833 South Wabash Avenue, where a 75,000-square-foot retail and office building was seized through a foreclosure auction earlier this year by the bondholders in a separate CMBS deal after its previous owner\u2019s default on a $9 million loan, according to loan data.\nOver 9 months in 2024, the retail at 1400 South Michigan brought in about $640,000 in revenue with about $330,000 in expenses, according to Morningstar Credit. The property was not bringing in enough revenue to service the debt in 2024, and revenue fell by close to 40 percent between 2019 and 2024. Loan servicer notes compiled by Morningstar show the borrower intended to sell the property as the loan was reaching maturity.\nThe properties were purchased under a Delaware Statutory Trust led by Waldman called CRA 1250 &amp; 1400 DST. The entity\u2019s structure allows an investor or company to sponsor the purchase of a property, while other investors purchase fractional interests in the property.\nProperty records show the trust paid at least $9.6 million for the retail parcels between the two buildings in 2015.\n\nWaldman and Gatlin did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe lawsuit alleges Crowd Realty defaulted on its $7.8 million loan tied to the two buildings. The owners first missed a payment in May 2020, and the loan was put into forbearance in October 2021. It reached maturity in March this year, at which point the debt had ballooned to $11 million in principal, interest, fees and deferred payments, the lawsuit said.\nRussland Capital, operated by Alex Vaisman and Jacob Bletnitsky, developed 1400 South Michigan with 257 condo units and 1250 South Michigan with 229, in 2008 and 2005, respectively.\nRetail tenants at 1400 South Michigan include a grocery store, a sushi restaurant and a breakfast restaurant called Chicago Waffles, while 1250 South Michigan is rented to Jimmy Johns, a cafe selling THC products, a nail salon, a spa and a dry cleaner. One retail space at 1250 South Michigan is vacant and available for lease.\nBenjamin Lissner, a Baird &amp; Warner dealmaker, said residential property values at the two buildings have remained relatively stable since they went up. Lissner has sold condos at both buildings.\nProperty values rose between 2015 and 2020, then took a hit during the pandemic, Lissner said. New construction around 1400 South Michigan has caused some unit values to dip, but there haven\u2019t been major price fluctuations, he said.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen dramatic drops in either building, or dramatic increases in value,\u201d Lissner said.\nMeanwhile, condos in high-end buildings on and near the Magnificent Mile on North Michigan Avenue have struggled to retain the values they achieved during the run up to the pandemic, with multiple units in the\nBloomingdale\u2019s building at 900 North Michigan\n, for instance, trading for prices seen back in the 1990s.\nIf the retail spaces do go into foreclosure, Lissner said he doubts that will have a big impact on the value of the residential condos in the buildings, even if the commercial values drop.\n\u201cIf any of those tenants move out because of the foreclosure, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to have much of an effect on the property values on the building,\u201d he said.",

That transaction placed the building\u2019s value at roughly $920 per square foot.\nRipple set up shop at 600 Battery Street in 2022 when it leased the entire building for its headquarters. It ended up being one of the largest new lease deals in San Francisco that year, according to the Business Times.\n\nThe 600 Battery Street building is three stories tall, though the nearly 1-acre parcel it sits on is zoned for construction up to 84 feet high, per the Business Times. In 2006, the city received an application to add three stories to 600 Battery, which would\u2019ve increased the building\u2019s height to 77 feet and total space to 218,000 square feet. That plan was withdrawn in 2010 but the site\u2019s zoning would allow Madison to try a similar expansion if it wants.\nThe Battery Street buy grows Madison Capital\u2019s Bay Area portfolio.\nIn 2022, the firm, together with Meadow Partners, grabbed the Ford Point commercial and industrial space in Richmond for $103.7 million. The following year, Madison acquired Seagate Technology\u2019s operational headquarters in Fremont for $260 million; later that year, Madison and Taconic Capital provided $40 million in financing for Ridge Capital Investors\u2019 acquisition of 180 Howard Street in San Francisco.\nRipple will remain the tenant at 600 Battery Street, and it remains to be seen whether Madison will move to buy the building outright.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "San Antonio leaders will decide this week whether to advance negotiations for a new Spurs arena that could anchor a multi-billion-dollar entertainment district downtown.\nThe San Antonio City Council is expected to vote Thursday on a term sheet for the $1.3 billion project, the first step toward binding agreements with Spurs Sports &amp; Entertainment, the San Antonio Express-News\nreported\n.\nThe arena would rise on the site of the former Institute of Texan Cultures at Hemisfair, with capacity for up to 18,500 fans. The deal calls for Spurs ownership to put up at least $500 million and cover any cost overruns. The city would contribute up to $489 million or 38 percent, whichever is lower, not counting the roughly $60 million needed to acquire the site. Bexar County would shoulder another 25 percent of costs \u2014 capped at $311 million \u2014 through hotel and rental car taxes, pending voter approval in November.\nThe financing\nplan\nrelies heavily on development around the arena. Spurs ownership and private partners would be required to build $1.4 billion worth of housing, retail, office and hotel projects on city-owned land in Hemisfair \u2014 a downtown grouping of city parks, the Tower of the Americas and the former Institute of Texan Cultures building currently being demolished \u2014 phased over 12 years. The first phase alone would include at least $500 million of construction, including a boutique hotel for visiting NBA teams, before the arena opens.\nThe Spurs\u2019 lease at the Frost Bank Center on the city\u2019s Eastside runs through 2032, and construction of the new facility could take nearly five years, lining up with the start of the 2032\u201333 season. Under the proposed lease, the team would pay $4 million in annual rent, escalating 2 percent each year, while retaining all arena revenues and operating responsibilities.\n\nThe term sheet also sets aside $75 million in community benefits over 30 years, or $2.5 million annually, that the Spurs would provide to the city for programs still to be determined. The team has floated childcare and transit subsidies, along with discounted tickets and local contracting pledges.\nIf voters reject the county\u2019s\nvenue tax\n, the deal could collapse. The Spurs have played occasional home games in Austin, Mexico and France under their current non-relocation agreement, but the new deal would lock the franchise into San Antonio for 30 years and set a limit of one foreign game per season and two home games within 100 miles of the Frost Bank Center (a range that would include Austin) per season.\nThe\nproject\nis pitched as more than an arena \u2014 city officials are banking on it as a catalyst for a convention center expansion, a 1,000-room hotel, a 5,000-seat venue, a land bridge over Interstate 37 and about 50 acres of mixed-use development.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The Consulate General of India is growing its presence in California with its first outpost in Los Angeles.\nThe South Asian country\u2019s diplomatic arm signed a full-floor lease at the Aon Center at 707 Wilshire Boulevard in downtown Los Angeles, Bisnow\nreported\n. The lease for approximately 21,000 square feet lasts 10 years and becomes India\u2019s second consulate office in the state after the first in San Francisco.\nIt\u2019s a notable addition that comes about two years after the $148 million deal for the 62-story office tower struck by Carolwood\u2019s Adam Rubin and Andrew Shanfeld.\nIt puts the Consulate in the same building as the local offices of State Bank of India, a major financial institution in the South Asian nation.\nIn 2023, Mayor Karen Bass sent a letter to India\u2019s ambassador to the United States angling for a consulate office in the city. That same year, Santa Monica business consultant Gunjan Bagla created a petition to send to Prime Minister Narenda Modi asking for a consulate in L.A., LAist\nreported\n.\u00a0 The entreaties came as Bass\u2019 predecessor as mayor, Eric Garcetti, served as U.S. Ambassador to India.\n\nLast year, Modi announced that he planned to open new consulates in L.A. and in Boston. \u201cI had asked for suggestions from you for two more consulates,\u201d Modi told Indian Americans in New York, LAist and India Today\nreported\n. \u201cI am happy to announce that after reviewing your suggestions, India has decided to open two new consulates in Boston and Los Angeles.\u201d\nThe Consulate General worked with NAI Capital to find the right place to plant a (orange, white and green) flag. The Encino-based firm had been touring office properties in the area since February, NAI executive vice president Tina LaMonica said in a statement, per\nConnect CRE\n. The new space \u201cprovides a world-class office environment\u201d for the consulate \u201cat the heart of the city,\u201d thereby \u201cmaking its essential services more accessible to the Indian American community across Southern California.\u201d\nThe Los Angeles area has the second-largest population of Indian Americans in California after the Bay Area. The Indian consulate in San Francisco opened in 1957. Up until now, India was the only country with a world top-5 economy without a diplomatic office in L.A.\nAn opening date for the consulate is yet to be announced.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Lenders just closed a refinancing deal for one of Hollywood\u2019s oldest continually running film studios.\nWells Fargo Bank and Barclays provided Hackman Capital Partners and Affinius Capital a three-year, $165 million financing package for Raleigh Studios, a 314,940-square-foot film studio on Melrose Avenue, Commercial Observer\nreported\n. The debt amounts to $524 per square foot.\nNetflix leases most of the property as a global hub for some of its biggest-budget deals, including projects with production companies owned by Barack and Michelle Obama, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, and Shonda Rhimes.\nThe financing will be used to repay $135 million of existing debt. The property has been fully occupied since 2018, with Netflix taking up 94 percent of the space. The streaming giant is about halfway through a 10-year lease at the property, where it\u2019s required to spend a minimum amount on lighting and grip equipment each year. MBS Group, a production service and equipment provider affiliate of Hackman, manages the property.\nRaleigh Enterprises has maintained ownership of all or some of the property since 1979 and has invested $40 million on renovations and expansion over the years. Today, the Los Angeles-based firm holds 30 percent ownership. Aside from Netflix, the rest of the space on the campus is taken up by a Raleigh affiliate leasing 10,050 square feet and smaller leases with Technicolor Federal Credit Union and Sunshine Kids.\n\nRaleigh Studios was founded in 1915 and boasts 13 sound stages with 135,350 square feet of office and support space. Hackman acquired a 36 percent ownership stake in the studio after the pandemic, while Affinius, under its previous name Square Mile Capital, took a 34 percent ownership piece.\nFilm and TV production in Greater Los Angeles has tumbled in recent years as companies look outside Hollywood to film their projects, avoiding high production costs and industry unpredictability. Production activity in the L.A. region fell more than 22 percent in the first quarter, L.A. Business First\nreported\n. Studio occupancy last year was at 63 percent, down from 69 percent the year prior.\nIn an attempt to lure filmmakers back to town, Gov. Gavin Newsom last month signed into law an increase on the state\u2019s film and TV tax credit program to raise the annual cap from $330 million to $750 million. The law also increased the percentage of a production\u2019s qualified expenditures that can be offset by tax credits from 20 percent to 35 percent.\nIn the meantime, some studio owners are\nturning to adaptive reuse\n, while others are hopeful the industry in Los Angeles will bounce back and crews will fill their soundstages once again.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The\nlisting\nprice is more than double the current record for the priciest sale in Monterey County, set last year with a $45 million\nmanse in Pebble Beach\n.\nFilm lovers might recognize the Spindrift Road property from the 1992 thriller \u201cBasic Instinct.\u201d The home was also featured in an episode of HBO\u2019s \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d set in the nearby city of Monterey. The property was also previously owned by world record holding aviator Steve Fossett.\nColorado-based software entrepreneur Gary Vickers and his wife Kerry Vickers are the sellers. The couple listed the seaside estate for more than $52 million in 2019 as well as the main home as a standalone listing for $29.6 million in 2022. They\u2019ve since completed an $11 million renovation and added more land to the property after grabbing an additional 1.3 acres in 2023 for $1.7 million, per the Business Journal.\n\nIn total, the property spans almost 5.4 acres and consists of five parcels and six houses, including the main house, four cottages and a new one-bedroom residence. The 12,000-square-foot main house boasts eight bedrooms, five fireplaces, a commercial kitchen with 1,250-bottle wine refrigerator, an outdoor pool, a steam room, a dry sauna and a four-car garage.\nIf a buyer wants to build more on the property, they\u2019ll be able to take advantage of more than an acre of open, developable land. The Vickerses took the initiative by adding new living structures, landscaping improvements and a water well to the new land. That land is in the process of being entitled to allow for the addition of another primary residence and several accessory dwelling units.\nRenovating and creating the Seacliff for sale today was Vickers\u2019 \u201ccrowning achievement,\u201d the seller said in a statement, per the Business Journal.

The mortgage filing indicates the project will be under Trammell Crow\u2019s Alexan multifamily brand.\nTrammell Crow bought the development site for $9.8 million from 777 Properties, which is led by Michael Shooster, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. U.S. Bank is the construction financing lender.\nShooster is CEO of Margate-based Shooster Holdings Corporation, which oversees phone answering, virtual receptionist and contact center services. Shooster also is listed as a real estate developer for Margate-based 777 Properties.\nIn September, the Margate City Commission approved the proposal for the apartment complex, city records show. At the time, Rez Se Land, an entity led by developer Saul Perez, filed the application.\nPerez is reportedly partnering with Trammell Crow on the project.\n\nCrow Holdings, led by Michael Levy, has invested in several South Florida apartment properties, and its\nTrammell Crow\nsubsidiary has completed multiple projects in the tri-county region. Nationwide, Trammell Crow has completed more than 285,000 units in the past four decades, according to its website.\nIn July, Crow Holdings paid\n$97.5 million\nfor the 376-unit 33 West Apartments complex with 14 three-story buildings and two one-story buildings at 6300 Southwest 24th Place in Davie. In December, Trammell Crow sold the 250-unit Solena Miramar complex at 3155 Southwest 147th Terrace in Miramar for\n$67.5 million\n, after completing it last year.\nIn 2022, Trammell Crow and Washington, D.C.-based private equity firm Carlyle completed the 368-unit Casero Apartments complex at 8255 Park Boulevard in unincorporated Miami-Dade County\u2019s Fontainebleau neighborhood. The pair sold it for\n$156 million\nin 2023 to Stockbridge.\nSouth Florida\u2019s\nmultifamily\nleasing and rent growth has calmed compared with the pandemic bonanza. That\u2019s due to a slowdown of the influx of out-of-state residents and a supply overhang from recent years\u2019 development frenzy.\nYet, developers continue to score\nconstruction financing\n, saying that demand and rent hikes will resume by the time their projects are completed.\nOak Row Equities landed\n$210.5 million\nin financing in June to build the 38-story, 324-unit 2900 Terrace apartment tower on the northeast corner of Northeast 29th Street and Northeast Fourth Avenue in Miami\u2019s Edgewater. Alex Karakhanian\u2019s Lndmrk Development is a project partner.\nIn Fort Lauderdale\u2019s Cypress Creek area, Grover Corlew scored a\n$92 million\nconstruction loan in June for the seven-story, 312-unit apartment building at 6261 Northwest Sixth Way. In Davie, 13th Floor Investments and JSB Capital Group nabbed a\n$67.5 million\nconstruction loan in March for the 383-unit, five-story Parks at Davie apartment complex on the northwest corner of Davie Road and Southwest 37th Street.\n",

        "content": "An office tower near Greenway Plaza has traded hands for the second time in less than two years, after the seller repositioned it amid a choppy market.\nDML Capital bought the 15-story tower at 3555 Timmons Lane, a 227,000-square-foot building in the Greenway-Upper Kirby submarket at the beginning of August. JLL Capital Markets secured acquisition financing from an unnamed insurance company for DML Capital, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n. Terms weren\u2019t disclosed, but Harris County appraisal records peg the Class A property\u2019s taxable value at $19.9 million.\nThe seller, Dallas-based\nNovel Office\n, acquired the building in December 2023 and invested at least $1.4 million into upgrades. Those improvements paid off in terms of leasing. Occupancy jumped from 55 to 95 percent, with 17 tenants signing leases since renovations began. Notable deals include Goode Company Restaurants relocating its headquarters into more than 9,000 square feet, and law firm Hicks Davis Wynn expanding its footprint to over 13,000 square feet.\nAnchored by the Houston-Galveston Area Council, which takes up roughly a third of the building, the building\u2019s roster has diversified with tenants in energy, real estate, tech, law and wealth management. The building, completed in 1982, underwent a major renovation in 2017. Novel\u2019s most recent work included a lobby overhaul, restroom and corridor upgrades, two new chillers and an enhanced conference center.\n\nAs older commodity towers\nstruggle\nwith vacancies, buildings that have been refreshed and repositioned in strong submarkets are luring tenants and attracting capital. The tower is \u201ca building with excellent bones that has been thoughtfully upgraded to meet modern workplace standards,\u201d JLL broker Michael Johnson said.\nFor DML Capital, the deal adds to a growing portfolio of Houston offices. In June, the firm acquired 3250 Briarpark Drive, a 200,000-square-foot Westchase property that serves as Mattress Firm\u2019s headquarters.\nThe back-to-back trades highlight a rare case of value creation in Houston\u2019s office sector, where most sales have been distressed in recent years.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Goldman sought approval in May for a stalking-horse bid of $10.1 million, according to bankruptcy court documents, though he had valued the site at $14 million.\nMaxi Capital provided financing for the deal, said Avery Hall principal Brian Ezra, adding the firm is weighing \u201cmultiple uses\u201d for the property.\nThe sale marks the latest in the\nunraveling of Goldman\u2019s Brooklyn empire\n, which ballooned to a billion dollars before collapsing under mountains of debt, liens and lawsuits. His company, All Year Holdings, was dismantled piece by piece after bankruptcy officers seized control of it in 2022 and sold off the assets.\nThe Bedford Avenue site was not owned by All Year, but was one of Goldman\u2019s personal holdings. He picked it up in 2014 for $7 million and poured the foundation for a 100-key hotel designed by ODA, according to the bankruptcy filing. But when the pandemic hit, funding dried up, interest payments stopped and mechanic\u2019s liens piled up to more than $1.4 million.\n\nGoldman owed Downtown Capital Partners some $45 million on the project after default interest ballooned on the original $10 million loan, according to court documents. Rather than foreclose, lender Gary Katz let Goldman place the property into bankruptcy, ensuring unsecured creditors get at least something back.\nThe property was expected to go for $13 million to $15 million, Katz said at the time. But it attracted no bidders besides Avery Hall, according to court filings.\nMeanwhile, All Year\u2019s restructuring team is\nchasing down Goldman\u2019s alleged \u201chandshake deals\u201d\nwith Brooklyn pals, including his neighbor and yeshiva buddy Yoel Silberstein. Goldman, facing a barrage of questions, has repeatedly pleaded the Fifth.\nKatz and a lawyer for Goldman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",

Foreign nationals and their family members who invest $1.05 million into\nOra by Casa Tua\nwill be eligible for a green card.\nThe project adds to Fortune\u2019s other EB-5 development in South Florida.\nCondo sales launched in 2023 for the 77-story, 533-unit project, planned for the 1-acre property at 1210 Brickell Avenue. Prices now start at $900,000.\nThe development will mark the first residential tower for the Casa Tua hospitality brand, owned by Micky and Leticia Grendene.\n\nThe condos, ranging from studios to four-bedroom units, will be delivered fully furnished with interiors designed by m2atelier, in-unit washers and dryers and smart home features. Owners will be able to rent their units out for a three-day minimum when they are not using them. A majority of buyers are foreign investors, Defortuna previously said.\nLast year, Fortune\nclosed on the site\nin a deal that valued the property at about $70 million. The developer also secured a $36 million pre-development loan from Amerant Bank. Construction is expected to begin by the end of the first quarter of next year, according to a spokesperson.\nThe tower will include four restaurants by Casa Tua: Terra, Uva, Fuocco and Vento; a three-story sky garden, co-working studios and wellness spaces.\nFortune recently attended the Real Estate Expo Argentina, a two-day fair in Buenos Aires, where the brokerage marketed eight projects to potential buyers and investors, including Ora by Casa Tua, Defortuna said.

        "content": "An affordable apartment building near Alamo Square is set to rise after spending a decade in planning limbo.\nThe plan for the 107-unit building at 650 Divisadero Street is moving forward after the Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing and Community Development filed a notice of intent to request up to $45 million in federal funding to operate the project, the San Francisco Standard\nreported\n. Under the proposal, developers would convert a two-story former auto body shop leased by a seismic retrofit company into a 10-story apartment building for low-income locals.\nThe site has been in various stages of planning since 2014, the outlet reported. Last year, the city approved a loan of $15 million for developers Jonathan Rose Companies and Young Community Developers to acquire the property from Divco Group.\nDivco had planned to build a 66-unit development with 20 percent of the units set aside for affordable housing. Jonathan Rose Companies and Young Community Development, a housing and jobs training nonprofit based in Bayview, are sponsoring the 650 Divisadero development in partnership with the mayor\u2019s housing and community development office.\nFederal and city funding will complement the low-income housing tax credit equity that is primarily financing the project.\nThe development will have 27 units set aside for families experiencing homelessness. The remaining 90 units will go to residents who make up to 50 percent of the city\u2019s median income, generally defined as one person making less than $54,550 or $77,950 for a household of four.\n\nJonathan Rose Companies specializes in affordable housing developments and has so far built 18,000 units across 17 states. The New York-based firm is currently building its first development in San Francisco, a 112-unit affordable housing project, at the\nHunters Point Shipyard\n.\nIt won\u2019t be the first time Jonathan Rose Companies and Young Community Development team up on a project.\nIn 2021, the city chose the two developers to build the affordable housing portion of the 88 Bluxome Street development in South of Market, which would consist of 150 affordable units out of 1,500 from developer Strada Investment Group. The project has yet to start construction, however.\nConstruction on the 650 Divisadero project is slated to begin late next year with move-ins beginning in 2028.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

The rent drop has taken property values down along the way, making financing more difficult, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nBut the reset is creating opportunities.\n\u201cThere are a ton of buyers coming to Austin, but not many sellers, so there\u2019s a real scarcity of quality listings,\u201d Newmark Group\u2019s Patton Jones told the outlet.\nThe slump stems in part from a construction rush that left Austin among the most oversupplied\nSun Belt\nmarkets, and high interest rates that curtailed investors\u2019 ability to borrow. With the 30-year fixed rate averaging 6.58 percent last week, capital is tight.\n\nThe tide could turn quickly, however.\nConstruction\nstarts are down roughly 80 percent as lenders shut off financing for new projects. At the same time, demand hasn\u2019t vanished \u2014 more than 21,900 units were absorbed in the past year. Analysts project that beginning next year and through 2029, much of the glut could be burned off, setting the stage for tighter vacancies and rent growth.\nMeanwhile, deals are getting done. Washington-based Weidner Apartment Homes recently bought The Alden, a 349-unit complex in Cedar Park, most recently appraised at $76 million. In nearby Leander, sponsors Beacon Real Estate Group and Constellation Group recapitalized The Conley, a 259-unit property built in 2020, through a loan from LaSalle arranged by Berkadia.\n\u201cOccupancy, rents and concessions certainly present a challenge in the near-term, but in the mid- to long-term, the capital markets see value in Austin,\u201d Matt Nihan, senior director of mortgage banking at Berkadia.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

Realty Bancorp and Norman Kravetz did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe addresses are: 29903 Agoura Road, 29899 Agoura Road, 29901 Agoura Road, 5230 Las Virgenes Road and 5855 Topanga Canyon Boulevard.\n\nThe property at 29899 Agoura Road was home to the Los Angeles Rams for nine years, but the team\u2019s billionaire owner Stan Kroenke\nis moving\nthe team\u2019s headquarters as part of a $10 billion development plan at Warner Center in Woodland Hills. The Rams\u2019 lease, which totaled 30 percent of the space, expired in February. Plus, Western General Insurance vacated its 28,000-square-foot lease at the Calabasas property three years before its expiration.\nTotal occupancy for the five office buildings declined to 72 percent at the end of June from 98 percent at underwriting \u2014 the properties are not bringing in enough money to pay off debt, Morningstar data shows. The portfolio has a debt service coverage ratio below one, and its net operating income has plummeted to about $3.1 million, down from about $6.3 million.\nBut the latest servicer commentary indicates that the borrower is requesting a short term forbearance, meaning a temporary suspension of loan payments for a set period; the special servicer is reviewing that and working toward a resolution.\nThe Greater Los Angeles area has a 24.1 percent office\nvacancy rate\n. Many office landlords are grappling with post-pandemic distress despite the recent return to office momentum, as tenants are choosing newer properties full of lavish amenities in desirable locations to lure workers back to their desks.\n",

        "content": "The long-blighted Valley Plaza complex in North Hollywood is finally set to come down.\nOn Tuesday, Los Angeles city commissioners voted to declare part of the once-thriving shopping center a public nuisance, the Los Angeles Times\nreported\n. The officials are clearing the way for the demolition of six buildings in the San Fernando Valley complex.\nThe neglected buildings and empty parking lots have been an issue for local officials and residents as squatters move in and as police and fire departments respond to calls regarding crime, fires and unresponsive individuals, according to the Times.\n\u201cThese ruined buildings have cast a pall on the entire community, depressing commerce for our small businesses, degrading the quality of life for an entire neighborhood, and creating a real danger for the community,\u201d City Councilmember Adrin Nazarian, who represents North Hollywood, said in a statement, per\nCBS News\n. \u201cOnce this shopping center was a source of pride to our community; now it\u2019s become a blight on the neighborhood and a constant danger to the public.\u201d\nCharles Company bought Valley Plaza in 2015 and it has remained vacant ever since, despite city officials expressing interest in developing or selling the site. An interested buyer can still snap up the Valley Plaza property if they\u2019re looking to revive the site.\nNazarian didn\u2019t mince words about the West Hollywood-based property owner\u2019s management of the 17-acre plaza.\n\u201cUnder the Charles Company, the properties have decayed to what you see standing behind me,\u201d the councilmember said in a news conference outside the property, according to CBS News. \u201cThey\u2019ve been vandalized, covered with graffiti, filled with trash, damaged beyond repair.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for Charles Company shifted the blame to the city, saying that the firm sought demolition permits and is \u201cready, willing and able to go forward and demolish these buildings.\u201d The developer purportedly hasn\u2019t been able to initiate demolition because it was awaiting approvals, though a city inspector said the developer hadn\u2019t fully completed the application.\n\u201c\u200aFor years, the city has asked the Charles Company to develop the site or sell it,\u201d Nazarian told reporters,\naccording\nto LAist. \u201cThey could at least secure it effectively. Instead, they\u2019ve left it to rot and turn into a blight on the entire neighborhood.\u201d\nCharles Company, speaking through attorney Fred Gaines, claimed that it\u2019s spent more than $1 million to maintain and secure the buildings but has faced difficulties with upkeep because people repeatedly trespass there. The firm is owned by\nMark and Arman Gabaee\n. In 2022, Arman was sentenced to four years in federal prison in what prosecutors called one of the biggest corruption cases in L.A. history.\nValley Plaza opened in 1951 and became a symbol of American suburbanism and mall culture, eventually becoming what was believed to be the largest shopping center on the West Coast.\nIt\u2019s been frequented by presidential candidates from John F. Kennedy, who came in its heyday in 1960 when he was running for the White House, to Mitt Romney, who held a news conference in his 2012 campaign in the decrepit complex to highlight Democratic opponents\u2019 supposed economic failings.\nUntil the buildings are demolished, they\u2019ll likely remain go-to spots for filmmakers looking to create scenes of abandoned, post-apocalyptic towns.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

Recent weeks have seen towers in Streeterville, the West Loop and the Gold Coast hit the block, as owners try to capitalize on rising rents before borrowing costs squeeze valuations further.\nDowntown fundamentals are working in sellers\u2019 favor. Net monthly rent at Class A buildings jumped 6.25 percent year-over-year in the first quarter, according to Integra Realty Resources. At the same time, supply is at its lowest point in decades. The fewest number of units in 30 years are expected to be delivered this year, due to high construction costs choking off development.\nWaterton\nbought the Grand Central during a slowdown in sales caused by interest rate hikes that compressed values. If it finds a buyer now, the deal will be a bellwether for whether rent growth is enough to overcome lingering financing headwinds.\n\nWaterton\u2019s Chicago portfolio demonstrates a strategy of buying and selling large multifamily assets, including the 2,346-unit Presidential Towers in the West Loop, the Elle in the South Loop and\nAvant at the Arboretum\nin suburban Lisle.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Standing next to the president of the hotel union, Zohran Mamdani was asked about casinos.\nThe Hotel and Gaming Trades Council, which represents hotel and casino workers, is a big supporter of three new casinos opening in New York.\nMamdani? Not so much.\nAfter an HTC-led rally on 76th Street on Wednesday, a reporter asked Mamdani if he would support casinos opening in New York City.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been open about my personal skepticism, and yet I also know that this is the law,\u201d Mamdani said, referring to the state-led process of awarding three casino licenses to applicants downstate. \u201cThe siting and the choices of which casinos will open that pertains to the state.\u201d\nDuring a June press conference, Mamdani indicated that he is \u201cgenerally in opposition to\u201d the expansion of casinos. He was absent for a vote on parkland alienation legislation that was needed for Steve Cohen\u2019s proposal for a casino next to Citi Field, but\ntold reporters\nthat he would have voted against the measure.\nThe moment underscored the delicate dance candidates sometimes have to pull off in making their policy positions clear without alienating major supporters. HTC endorsed Mamdani after his win in the Democratic primary, having previously supported former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. They can\u2019t be expected to agree on everything, but if Mamdani had come out stronger against casinos on Wednesday, it would have made headlines.\nIt also highlights the weird political space casinos occupy. Labor unions support the competition in New York because these casinos mean tens of thousands of construction, hotel and casino jobs. Progressive electeds, usually on the unions\u2019 side, typically don\u2019t want to be seen wholeheartedly supporting something as morally fraught as gambling, even as some of these proposals also throw in affordable housing as part of the package.\nThe rally on Wednesday had nothing to do with casinos, but rather was real estate-related. The event was part of the union\u2019s broader campaign against Reuben Brothers\u2019 Surrey Hotel. Former workers, who were laid off when the hotel shut its doors during the pandemic,\nsued\nthe hotel in April, alleging that the owners violated city law when they failed to rehire them. Reuben Brothers bought the hotel for $150 million in 2020 and reopened it in October 2024.\nUnder the city\u2019s Displaced Hotel Service Workers Act, when a hotel is sold, the new owners must offer employment to hotel service workers who have worked at the hotel in the year leading up to the change. The employees are to be retained for 90 days, and if their work is satisfactory, kept on after that.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about\n: For those of you who indicated that you would support Mayor Eric Adams after Andrew Cuomo\u2019s primary loss, are you still backing his reelection bid? Do reports of forthcoming indictments against former and current aides affect your decision? Send a note to\nkathryn@therealdeal.com\n.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned:\nICYMI, John Catsimatidis appears in the film \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d starring Timothee Chalamet. He joked to Politico New York that now he needs to buy a movie studio. Thank you to Holden Walter-Warner for passing this along!\n\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\u00a0There may be financial consequences for mayoral campaigns that drop out at the eleventh hour. Candidates to the right of Zohran Mamdani are increasingly being asked to drop out in order to unify the vote behind one anti-Mamdani candidate. But according to\nCity &amp; State\n, citing Campaign Finance Board rules, campaigns that stop campaigning \u201cmay be required to repay an amount equivalent to the amount of public funds paid to the candidate that were not spent on qualified expenditures.\u201d\n\u2014\u00a0Andrew Cuomo is counting on President Trump\u2019s help to beat Mamdani, according to comments made at a Hamptons fundraiser,\nPolitico\nreports. \u201cTrump himself, as well as top Republicans, will say the goal is to stop Mamdani. And you\u2019ll be wasting your vote on Sliwa. So I feel good about that,\u201d Cuomo said in audio from the fundraiser obtained by Politico. While the candidate has publicly distanced himself from the president, he didn\u2019t deny that he or his team has been in contact with the White House about the race.\n\u2014 Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 former chief advisor, Ingrid Lewis-Martin, is expected to face more corruption charges, according to the\nNew York Post\n. She will reportedly be indicted on charges that she accepted handouts in exchange for favorable positions on redevelopment plans. The indictment is also expected to name Jesse Hamilton, Adams\u2019 deputy commissioner of real estate services.\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Wednesday was\n$9.6 million\nfor a 3,360-square-foot townhouse at 310 West 11th Street in the West Village. The Hudson Advisory Team at Compass\nhad the listing.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$21.8 million\nfor a 17,260-square-foot office building at 123 Lafayette Street in Chinatown.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$7.8 million\nfor a 7,095-square-foot townhouse at 112 1st Place in Carroll Gardens. Gail Donnarumma of Daniel Gale Sotheby\u2019s International Realty has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for a proposed 105,463-square-foot, 99-unit, 12-story property at 331 Maple Street in Prospect Lefferts Gardens.

        "content": "Like many entrepreneurs, Sam Eshaghoff got his start in business early. Instead of selling candy on the playground, he sold good SAT scores to striving high school students on Long Island. That didn\u2019t go well.\nAt 19, his test-taking business unraveled. His arrest made national headlines and Eshaghoff was forced to withdraw from Emory University.\n\u201cIt really affected me for a long time,\u201d Eshaghoff, now 33 and a New York City real estate developer, said. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to get dog poop out of your shoe. You\u2019ve just got to keep on walking and scraping and it takes a while, but eventually it all goes away.\u201d\nToday, Eshaghoff, who grew up in Great Neck and now lives in the city, gets his grades (and paycheck) from square footage, lease deals and bank loans instead of multiple-choice questions. But his ambition still evokes the teenage test-taker\u2019s. His development firm, West Egg Development, is completing its largest project, a 38-unit apartment building with 5,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space in Queens. The sleek grey, five-story building has floor-to-ceiling windows and occupies a corner lot in Bayside.\n\u201cThis is the culmination of everything that\u2019s led up to it,\u201d Eshaghoff said as he toured the property on a recent Friday. \u201cHopefully, the next one\u2019s even bigger.\u201d\nNot every New York City developer is a big-name, deep-pocketed and well-connected builder. Most are smaller upstarts who risk their own money and dream of making it big. For every 60-story tower in Midtown, there are dozens of outer-borough storage facilities and multifamily developments with a smaller name behind them.\nMany of them are like Eshaghoff, who\u2019d like to be connected with building, rather than his teenage gig.\nThe road to this point wasn\u2019t easy. After graduating from the Zicklin School of Business at Baruch College in 2014, Eshaghoff couldn\u2019t land his dream job as an investment banker.\n\u201cI had a lot of trouble getting my first job because of the SAT situation,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody wants to hire somebody who\u2019s been in the news for that sort of stuff.\u201d\nHis first break came from a Manhattan private equity firm that was starting a real estate division.\n\u201cI thought the whole scandal had a \u201ctwo-edge sword\u201d to it,\u201d Arthur Bocchi, who hired Eshaghoff to help him launch the firm\u2019s real estate arm, said. \u201cHe was obviously very intelligent to be able to take those tests and score so high. He also had some ingenuity and creativity, but it was being applied in the wrong way.\u201d\n\nThe pair worked side by side to build a 400,000-square-foot cold storage facility near New Jersey\u2019s Port Newark and a 75,000-square-foot condo project in Downtown Brooklyn.\n\u201cIt was a lot of work for Sam and me to undertake together without much of a staff,\u201d Bocchi said. \u201cThe more work I gave him, the more he was able to step up and do.\u201d\nThey left the firm and started to flip one-, two- and three-family residential properties across the tristate area. A family office from Great Neck later hired Eshaghoff to handle acquisitions.\nBut Eshaghoff\u2019s grandfather \u2013 a longtime homebuilder who emigrated from Iran in 1960 \u2013 encouraged him to go out on his own. With $125,000 of his savings and $480,000 from friends and family, he built his first solo project \u2013 two, two-family ground-up homes in East New York, Brooklyn. The project nearly collapsed when he ran out of money mid-construction, forcing him to personally guarantee a $500,000 bridge loan.\n\u201cIt was well beyond my net worth at the time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a very scary experience and I had to make the bank payment every month.\u201d\nHe eventually sold the homes at a profit, giving him the confidence and capital to launch West Egg. He has since weathered the inevitable headaches of New York City real estate development, like neighbor disputes that shut down construction, permitting delays and other red tape.\nBut West Egg has grown steadily from small flips to multi-million-dollar projects and Eshaghoff rebuilt his reputation along the way. More than a decade and a dozen real estate projects after his arrest, he is putting the final touches on 215-20 Northern Boulevard, the Bayside development. It\u2019s a 421a project and a joint venture with the longtime owners of the property, built with a $16 million construction loan from Ponce Bank.\nEshaghoff runs his business lean, hiring teams on a project-by-project basis and keeping overhead low. He is backed by friends and family investors, he said.\nAnd the cheating scandal almost never comes up these days.\n\u201cI had to reinvent who I was and my skills,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very happy with the way things have turned out. It\u2019s a serendipitous, happy accident.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Another Loop hotel has slipped into distress, with fallout that could ripple into one of the city\u2019s largest office-to-residential conversions.\nCWCapital Asset Management is moving to seize the 429-key Club Quarters at 111 West Adams Street after submitting a $30 million credit bid at a Cook County sheriff\u2019s sale, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The Washington, D.C.-based special servicer represents bondholders on a $274 million loan tied to the Chicago property and three other Club Quarters hotels owned by Blackstone. The New York private equity giant defaulted on the debt during the pandemic, when travel demand cratered, and foreclosure proceedings have been underway since last year.\nThe takeover adds another distressed asset to downtown\u2019s growing roster. But the timing is especially thorny for the Clark Adams Building, a 41-story tower where the hotel occupies floors three through 10. Developer\nPrimera Group\nis pushing a $184 million plan to convert much of the office space above into 400 apartments. That project, which counts on $68 million in tax-increment financing, is one of several Loop office conversions backed by a $317 million subsidy program launched under former Mayor Lori Lightfoot.\nPrimera\u2019s\nplan\nhas preliminary TIF approval but still requires Chicago City Council sign-off \u2014 and a zoning amendment for the entire property. Normally, that would mean buy-in from the hotel owner, raising the question of whether CWCapital will support or obstruct the conversion. The lender declined comment to the outlet.\n\nAs reported previously in\nThe Real Deal\n, the planned residential mix includes 195 studios, 122 one-bedrooms, and 83 two-bedrooms, with 121 units designated as affordable for households earning 60 percent of the area median income, which translates to about $53,000 for a two-person household.

The loan refinances the\n$242.5 million\nconstruction loan MSD Partners provided in 2022 and increases the debt by $97.5 million.\nThe refinancing has a floating interest rate, the mortgage record shows.\nRelated Ross completed the 285,000-square-foot One Flagler this year, marking the first project finished by the firm. The Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill-designed tower is at the foot of the Royal Park Bridge and overlooks the Lake Worth Lagoon.\nOne Flagler was about 95 percent leased when it opened in February, with tenants including GoldenTree Asset Management, Ocean Sound Partners and Vista Investments of Florida. Greek restaurant\nEstiatorio Milos\n, led by Costas Spiliadis, opened in a roughly 10,000-square-foot space on the ground level and second floor.\nBDT &amp; MSD was formed in 2023 through the merger of merchant bank BDT &amp; Company and MSD Partners.\n\nRoss, 85, seized on downtown West Palm five years ago, first buying and developing office towers and then starting residential projects. Last year, he stepped back from New York-based Related Companies that he founded over 50 years ago to start West Palm-based\nRelated Ross\n, focusing on South Florida and especially on downtown West Palm. Ross remains Related Companies\u2019 nonexecutive chairman and its single largest shareholder.\nRelated Ross has about eight office buildings, including those purchased, completed, under construction and planned, in downtown West Palm. Also in the area, Related Ross completed the 322-unit\nLaurel\napartment tower and is developing the two-tower\nSouth Flagler House\ncondominium with 108 units. Another two condo projects are planned.\nRoss also has become a benefactor in South Florida for various causes, and has stressed the need for more affordable housing in Palm Beach County.\nRoss\u2019 office development has remained unscathed from the slowdown in the influx of out-of-state businesses, as he has tapped his New York contacts to lease his West Palm buildings.\nOne Flagler was at one point nicknamed the \u201chedge fund tower\u201d among real estate circles due to hefty leasing by financial firms.\n",

Vaishali and Samuil have advisory roles in Thakkar Developers, led by CEO Poorvesh Thakkar.\nThe family plans to move the headquarters of these companies, which altogether have over a hundred employees, from McKinney to a single office building in Allen, Samuil said.\nThe Thakkars are also developing projects in Plano, Georgetown and\nNew York\n.\n",

Trump\u2019s sons and Trump Organization executives Eric and Donald Jr. were also hit with penalties, bringing the total above $527 million.\nWhile the appeals panel upheld injunctive relief meant to restrain Trump Organization practices, it scrapped the massive disgorgement order entirely, dealing a blow to Attorney General Letitia James, who described the case in February as proof of Trump\u2019s \u201clying, cheating, and staggering fraud.\u201d Her office had no immediate comment, according to the Associated Press.\nEngoron\u2019s other penalties, including barring Trump and his sons from serving as corporate officers, remain on pause pending further appeals. Trump kept collection at bay with a $175 million bond. The decision, nearly 11 months after oral arguments, leaves James the\u00a0option to appeal to New York\u2019s highest court.\nJust last week, the Justice Department\nsubpoenaed James\nin connection with the landmark civil fraud lawsuit while separately investigating James\u2019 own real estate transactions.\n\nJames\u2019 lawyer said the investigation was \u201cthe most blatant and desperate example of this administration carrying out the president\u2019s political retribution campaign.\u201d\nOne investigation linked to the\nalleged retribution campaign\nis examining whether James falsified records for homes she owns in Brooklyn and Virginia, worth under $2 million combined, to obtain better loan terms.\nAccusations around mortgages are becoming a calling card of the Trump administration. Trump recently called on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to resign, according to\nBloomberg\n, after Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte told Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate Cook\u2019s mortgages.\nThe Department of Justice is set to investigate Cook, echoing\nprobes into James\nand frequent Trump critic Adam Schiff, a senator from California.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Next Realty just scored one of the longest-term office loans in Chicago in years, giving the landlord of a River North office building breathing room as others struggle to refinance or unload assets at a discount.\nThe Skokie-based firm landed an $11 million loan, tied to the Kingsbury Center at 350 West Hubbard Street, from StanCorp Financial Group, CEO Andrew Hochberg\ntold\nCoStar News. The six-story, 135,000-square-foot building is 95 percent leased, with retail tenants CVS and Petco on the ground floor, and a roster of developers upstairs that includes Related Midwest, the Habitat Company, Oxford Capital and Bond Companies. Habitat also owns a stake in the property and manages it.\nThe 25-year debt deal stands out in a market where lenders have been pulling back on office, leaving many owners to sell at steep losses or hand property back to lenders. Next Realty knows the pain firsthand: earlier this year it sold\n620 North LaSalle Street\nfor less than half its loan balance.\nThe Kingsbury Center loan replaced a $13.3 million Nationwide Life note from 2015, but unlike many borrowers, Next paid down the balance enough to secure fresh cash. Instead of pocketing proceeds, the firm will reserve funds for leasing and tenant rollover, Hochberg said.\n\nProperties in the\nRiver North\narea are also grabbing buyers in recent days, albeit at steep discounts. R2 purchased a six-story, 70,000-square-foot office property at 303 West Erie Street for $7.5 million last week, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n.\u00a0 The seller, New York-based Alvarez &amp; Marsal Property Investments, paid double that for the building in 2017.\nThe Kingsbury Center\u2019s stability \u2014 a near-full roster of longterm tenants with an average tenure of 15 years \u2014 helped Next Realty lock in favorable terms. The loan\u2019s interest rate resets every three years but runs through 2050, an unusually long commitment in today\u2019s climate. By contrast, other recent Chicago office financings have been massive and high-profile: Blackstone secured a $1.3 billion CMBS extension on\nWillis Tower\n, while Hines refinanced Salesforce Tower for $610 million. On the flip side, Neil Bluhm\u2019s\nJMB Realty\nhad to inject more than $56 million to refinance 900 North Michigan.\nFor Hochberg, who once ran his family\u2019s Sportmart chain before turning full time to real estate, the financing is less about aggressive growth and more about defense. Hochberg told the outlet that he doesn\u2019t believe now is a good time to sell office buildings in Chicago \u201cunless you have to.\u201d\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Former top Adams aide Ingrid Lewis-Martin and Jesse Hamilton, who oversees the city\u2019s office leases, face charges for steering city contracts to specific real developers and helping fast-track their projects in exchange for personal home renovations and other perks.\nFour new indictments accuse Lewis-Martin of accepting $75,000 in bribes between March 2022 and November 2024, as part of a wide-ranging scheme involving eight co-defendents, including Hamilton, who is the deputy commissioner of real estate services at the Department of Citywide Administrative Services.\u00a0Hamilton is named in one of the four indictments.\nMost of the bribe money, $50,000, was directed to an account run by her son, Glenn Martin II, according to the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office. Other alleged bribes were less conventional, including thousands of dollars worth of catered food at Gracie Mansion and a speaking role on a television show.\nLewis-Martin, who resigned last year as Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 chief aide, was already\nindicted\nin December on charges that she intervened on behalf of hoteliers seeking construction approvals in exchange for more than $100,000 in bribes to her and her son.\nMuch like the first set of charges, the latest indictments center around the city\u2019s dealings with private real estate companies. The complaints accuse Lewis-Martin using her position in the Adams administration to help out developers Tian Ji Li and Yechiel Landau.\nAccording to one of the new indictments, Lewis-Martin pushed Hamilton and other city officials to direct contracts for asylum seeker shelter sites to property owners favored by developer Tian Ji Li. As part of his arrangement with the property owners, Li received 10 percent of the contract\u2019s value. In February 2023, the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation entered\u00a0 a $12 million licensing agreement with one of the owners, netting Li $1.2 million, according to the indictment. He allegedly transferred $50,000 worth of that haul to Martin II\u2019s account.\nThe indictment describes Lewis-Martin pressuring Hamilton, who helped oversee the selection of sites, to consider the properties preferred by Li. On May 25, 2024, Lewis-Martin called Hamilton to make this clear: \u201cI want you all to go back to the sites for TJ Li\u2026I need those done\u2026whatever site TJ wants, I need him to get them. Because that\u2019s our fucking people,\u201d she said, according to the indictment.\nShe called back a few days later to say: \u201cCan you make sure that when I\u2019m sending you a fucking site, [John Doe # 2] finds the site I fucking send you,\u201d the indictment details. Hamilton allegedly confirmed to Lewis-Martin in a June 25 call: \u201cTJ, he\u2019s, he\u2019s first. He\u2019s first in line.\u201d\nLewis-Martin also allegedly helped speed up approvals for a karaoke bar Li was building in Queens.\nAnother indictment accuses Lewis-Martin of intervening on behalf of developer Yechiel Landau on a project at 498 Columbia Street in Red Hook, 1211 Southern Boulevard in the Bronx, and an unidentified apartment complex in Jamaica, Queens.\nAt the Bronx property, Lewis-Martin allegedly put pressure on HPD to get the agency\u2019s approval to refinance and buy out a previous investor on the city-subsidized property. The agency signed off on Landau\u2019s takeover of the property before it assigned a project manager to work with him to ensure the preservation of affordable housing at the building, according to the indictment.\nIn exchange for Lewis-Martin\u2019s help, Landau allegedly paid for more than $5,000 worth of renovation work at her home.\u00a0 At the time, her sister had been living with her and needed a place to stay while the work was being done, according to the indictment. Hamilton agreed to let her sister stay on a lower level of his house, which Landau paid to have cleaned and repainted to accommodate the move, prosecutors allege.\nThe indictment describes messages between the three on encrypted messaging app Signal on July 12, 2023 as Lewis-Martin simultaneously tried to get other city officials to focus on the Red Hook project.\nLewis-Martin asked then-Deputy Mayor of Housing and Economic Opportunity Maria Torres-Springer to \u201czip out\u201d of a meeting with Mayor Eric Adams about hate crimes to join a call with the Department of Housing Preservation and Development \u201cfor a hot minute to just give your blessings.\u201d\nShe immediately followed up with: \u201cI know the mayor is major priority, but if you could skip out for second. They had been bugging the stuffings out of me,\u201d according to the indictment.\n\nTwo minutes later, she messaged Landau, saying that Torres-Springer\u2019s chief of staff joined the call with HPD. She also assured him: \u201cI promise you that your project is priority,\u201d she wrote, according to the indictment.\nEight minutes later, Landau messaged Lewis-Martin and her son, lamenting that an HPD employee was \u201cgiving push back\u201d on the project\u2019s financing closing in December. The residential project was going to be developed using various\ncity subsidy programs\nfor senior and low-income housing.\nLewis-Martin\u2019s son, who is accused of serving as an intermediary, allegedly responded with \u201cF*** him we make it close.\u201d\nThe indictment describes Lewis-Martin speaking to the deputy mayor and then sending multiple text messages \u2014\u00a0sometimes several in one day \u2014 to then-HPD Commissioner Adolfo Carri\u00f3n demanding to know what was holding up the project.\n\u201cI need to know what they are missing which is preventing them from moving forward. Thank you,\u201d she sent on July 28, 2023, according to the indictment.\nThe next day she followed up with: \u201cWe need to get it done,\u201d and then adding, \u201cDecember.\u201d\nShe also asked Carri\u00f3n to send a document detailing \u201cthe order of the projects,\u201d referring to HPD\u2019s pipeline, according to the indictment.\nLewis-Martin also allegedly met with Landau and his personal consultant on the project without HPD. She told the two: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna, we gotta get that place [HPD] under control, so when we [expletive] tell them something, we expect them to make that shit move\u2026 I\u2019m gonna speak to the Mayor, and then that\u2019s it, so we\u2019re just gonna push for December [2024] and we\u2019re gonna keep it going,\u201d according to the indictment.\nThe project closed in December, despite the fact that \u201chundreds of projects are in HPD\u2019s pipeline, but only a few are able to close each calendar year,\u201d a press release from the Manhattan District Attorney and Department of Investigations notes.\nOn September 11, 2023, Lewis-Martin sent a text message to Hamilton alluding to the renovations planned at her home: \u201cAh, we will get it done. I called my contractors to advise,\u201d according to the indictment.\nIn October 2023, Lewis-Martin texted her sister: \u201cI am excited that soon you will live in a quality home. You are deserving. Jesse\u2019s place will be ready for your review. It needs paint but we just need it clean\u2026 I told them we needed to move you in ASAP. Just have it clean.\u201d\nAnother indictment accuses Lewis-Martin of conspiring with Gina and Anthony Argento, the owners of the film and production studio Broadway Stages, to get the Department of Transportation to change its planned redesign of McGuinness Boulevard in Brooklyn, which would have added protected bike lanes. The Argentos opposed the plan, not wanting vehicle traffic to be reduced near Broadway Stages.\nIn exchange for Lewis-Martin\u2019s help, the Argentos allegedly paid her $2500, spent $10,000 to cater an event at Gracie Mansion and provided her a speaking role on the TV show, \u201cGodfather of Harlem.\u201d Anthony Argento also allegedly promised to be her agent and to get her more roles on that show as well as another, \u201cBlue Bloods.\u201d\nThe indictments come as the mayor faces an uphill battle to re-election. Adams was able to\nshed\nhis own criminal charges this year, but his inner circle has not been so lucky.\nNews surfaced nearly a year ago that state investigators were looking into Lewis-Martin and Hamilton. In October, state officials had\nseized the phones\nof Lewis-Martin, Hamilton and Cushman &amp; Wakefield broker Diana Boutross as they returned from a vacation in Japan.\n",

        "content": "Taconic Partners and National Real Estate Advisors have inked a deal to bring the discount supermarket chain Aldi to Midtown.\nThe German grocer signed a lease for 25,000 square feet at the\nnew luxury rental building\nat 312 West 43rd Street, known as The Ellery. The flagship location will have an entrance on 42nd Street and is expected to open next year, according to the landlord.\nCBRE\u2019s Lon Rubackin, Michael Kadosh and Bevan Cohen represented the landlord in the deal. Ripco Real Estate\u2019s Esther Bukai represented Aldi.\nThe deal comes on the heels of Aldi announcing plans to open more than 225 stores in the U.S. this year. Last year, Aldi opened nearly 120 stores, bringing the total number of locations to over 2,400 and making it the third-largest grocery chain by store count in the U.S. The openings this year are part of a five-year plan by Aldi to add 800 locations in total by the end of 2028.\n\nThe grocer currently has locations in East Harlem, the Bronx and three in Brooklyn, according to its website.\nThe developers took over the Times Square-adjacent property in 2018 via a 99-year ground lease. The site used to be the headquarters of the 1199SEIU union. In 2022, they landed a $204 million construction loan from Union Labor Life Insurance Company to build a 32-story, 330-unit building. Taconic was also part of a big neighboring project as well, locking in $200 million of long-term debt alongside Mitsui Fudosan America for 525 West 52nd Street in 2019.\nLeasing for The Ellery kicked off 11 months ago and the building is fully leased, according to the landlord. In addition to the retail space, the Handel Architects-designed building will have spa areas, private gardens, workspaces and a pool on the rooftop.\n",

Energy Crossing II, an eight-story, 327,000-square-foot 15011 Katy Freeway, was built in 2014. At the time of the trade, it was about 30 percent occupied. The seller of Energy Crossing II was also Invesco Real Estate.\nEnergy Crossing I\u2019s most recent appraisal valued the building at $17.25 million, while its counterpart logged an appraisal of $23.5 million.\nThe office park sits on more than 5 acres and features an on-site fitness center.\n\nBoth properties are located in the middle of Houston\u2019s popular Energy Corridor. The submarket has recently attracted tenants like DNV USA, which\nsigned a deal for 63,000 square feet\nat the Offices at Greenhouse, another Capital Commercial Investments-owned property.\nAs a result, its vacancy rate was 21.5 percent at the end of the first quarter, according to a report from Partners Real Estate.\nDoug Agarwal\u2019s Capital Commercial Investments has recently been focused on reviving suburban office properties in Dallas and Houston. In addition to Energy Crossing I and II, the firm purchased the Offices at Greenhouse, at 19219 Katy Freeway, last summer, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n.\nWhen it purchased Energy Crossing II, Capital Commercial Investments said it intended to capitalize on the flight to quality trend gripping the office market.\nAt the end of the second quarter, vacancy at properties built in the last 15 years averaged 14.9 percent, compared to 27.5 percent in properties constructed before 2009.

That pace is higher than any year since 2018, when monthly evictions peaked at about 1,666 per month.\nThere are approximately 2.2 million rental units in the city.\nThe jump in evictions comes as housing courts grind through a backlog of cases filed after the pandemic moratorium lifted in 2022. The easing of clogged housing courts appears to be fueling the spike in evictions.\nAnn Korchak of Small Property Owners of New York argued that eviction is \u201ca last resort,\u201d but necessary to keep buildings solvent.\nThe ones profiting the most from the evictions may be city marshals: 29 officers brought in nearly $20.5 million combined last year, up from $14 million in 2019.\n\nSince 2021, landlords have filed nearly half a million eviction cases citywide. The greatest share of those have been in the Bronx, where more than 9 percent of households received court notices last year. Fewer than 10 percent of filings result in a formal eviction order, but the process can take months or years to resolve, leaving tenants and landlords in limbo.\nAmid the rise in eviction actions this year, eviction filings have slowed. Landlords have launched about 9,500 cases a month in 2025, down from 10,500 over the same period last year.\nAnalysts say legal protections like the city\u2019s right-to-counsel program have blunted the damage for tenants, but those safety nets remain uneven. Many households earn just above income thresholds, while others who qualify can\u2019t get help fast enough.\n\u201cOne financial shock can be the precipitating factor for an eviction case,\u201d Peter Hepburn of Princeton\u2019s Eviction Lab told Gothamist.\nThe Robin Hood Foundation warned last month that one in four low-income New Yorkers can\u2019t reliably cover rent, leaving many \u201cone financial shock\u201d away from eviction. Housing advocates say the ripple effects extend far beyond individual families, destabilizing schools, employers and neighborhoods, not to mention their landlords.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The company leased the entirety of the 105,000-square-foot building owned by West Tasman Drive 10, an affiliate of Copia Lending.\nThe\nCopia Lending affiliate foreclosed\non the building\u2019s delinquent loan and seized the property last October. The lender estimated the office building\u2019s value at $23.7 million, placing it 53.8 percent below the property\u2019s assessed value in January 2024.\nSan Jose-based entity called Heritage 10 West Tasman bought the building in 2021 for $30 million. It filed for bankruptcy to try to avoid foreclosure and the loss of the building. The entity said the building was vacant for years, and it had a hard time securing a tenant to move in,\nper\nthe Mercury News.\n\nThe Archer Aviation lease adds to its growing presence in town. The company now operates three large work hubs in north San Jose all within a few blocks of each other. That includes its headquarters at 190 West Tasman \u2014 down the street from its latest new office \u2014 and 77 Rio Robles, which it leased in 2023.\nArcher is looking at using the Bay Area as its testing grounds for its electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles, which are similar to helicopters. Last year, it announced plans to create an \u201curban air mobility network,\u201d featuring takeoff and landing locations in South San Francisco, Napa, San Jose, Oakland and Livermore. It would use electric-powered air taxis to reduce commute times across the region.\nThe company is moving forward with plans to manufacture, mass produce and deliver electric aircraft to make the vision a reality.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A Dallas landmark is getting a makeover via\nSycamore Development\n.\nThe Dallas-based firm is planning a $200 million overhaul of the historic Magnolia Building downtown, redeveloping the 103-year-old tower into a mix of hotel rooms and apartments.\nThe 29-story building at 1401 Commerce Street, known for its neon Pegasus sign, will see its 320-plus hotel rooms cut in half to 160, while 130 mixed-income apartments are added, the Dallas Morning News\nreported\n.\nPlans filed with the state last week outline a redesign with hotel amenities on the first two floors, apartment lobbies and amenities on the third, and residential units through the 16th floor. The hotel will occupy the upper stories, with separate elevators serving each use.\n\nThe apartments will include 39 studios, 52 one-bedrooms and 39 two-bedrooms, with just 59 of the units leased at market rates, per city ordinance. The developer has already lined up $20 million in state housing tax credits over the next decade and intends to pursue federal historic tax credits, city incentives and tax increment financing district funds to help finance the project. Construction, pegged at $90 million, is slated to start early next year and wrap by 2028.\nThe redevelopment is a pivot from prior plans. Current owner\nNewcrestImage\nbought the Magnolia in 2021 with ambitions for a high-end redo, including a potential Waldorf Astoria hotel location and a three-story addition, but that never materialized. Sycamore is now under contract to buy the property from the Grapevine-based firm, with Davidson Bogel Real Estate and attorney Philip Kingston advising on the deal.\nOriginally the headquarters for Magnolia Petroleum when it opened in 1922, the building was the tallest west of the Mississippi at the time and a symbol of Dallas\u2019 early oil-fueled growth. Its Pegasus, installed in 1934, has long been one of Downtown Dallas\u2019 most recognizable icons. In 2022 the Dallas City Council footed the\n$358,000 bill\nto secure and repair the 30-ton sign\u2019s eroding steel supports to prevent a fall.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Jesse Hamilton, a political protege of Mayor Eric Adams who oversaw the city\u2019s office leases, has stepped down.\nHamilton resigned Thursday after being\nindicted\non a conspiracy charge related to allegedly working with Ingrid Lewis-Martin, a former top aide to the mayor, to speed up certain developers\u2019 projects and steer city contracts to preferred players. As deputy commissioner of real estate services for the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, Hamilton handled the city\u2019s 400 leases at private properties, spanning more than 22 million square feet, though that responsibility was shifted away from him late last year.\nIn a statement, DCAS Commissioner Louis Molina said his agency\u2019s focus is \u201cunwavering.\u201d\n\u201cDCAS is the backbone of city government, and bearing that weight has never fallen upon just one person,\u201d he said. \u201cJesse Hamilton has tendered his resignation, and I\u2019ve accepted it, effective today.\u201d\nRafael Carvalho, formerly the chief of staff to the executive deputy commissioner for asset and property management, has been named acting deputy commissioner.\nHamilton joined DCAS in August 2022 as legal counsel and quickly rose through the ranks. The leasing deals he oversaw drew increased scrutiny after state officials\nseized\nhis phone in 2024, along with those of Lewis-Martin and Cushman &amp; Wakefield broker Diana Boutross as they returned from a trip together in September.\n\nThat fall, DCAS restructured its real estate division and reassigned the authority to execute leases to Shameka Overton, executive deputy commissioner for asset and property management, according to the agency.\nThe indictments released Thursday accuse Hamilton of playing a role in an alleged scheme that helped fast-track developer Yechiel Landau\u2019s projects. He also allegedly tried to use his authority at DCAS to steer a city contract to a Queens apartment building that ultimately didn\u2019t come to fruition. A separate indictment, which doesn\u2019t name him as a defendant, also describes Lewis Martin directing Hamilton to prioritize property owners hand-picked by developer Tian Ji Li for city contracts for asylum seeker shelters.\nHamilton is named as a defendant in one indictment, but Lewis-Martin faces charges in all four indictments that were released Thursday. The two, along with six other co-defendants, have pleaded not guilty.\nEarlier in his career, Hamilton worked as legal counsel to Adams when he was a state Senator. When Adams left the legislature to become the Brooklyn borough president, many saw Hamilton as his hand-picked successor. He served two terms representing the 20th District in Brooklyn.\nIn a statement, Adams, who is already facing a difficult path to re-election, emphasized that he has not been accused of wrongdoing and said his \u201ccommitment to New Yorkers is unwavering.\u201d Federal corruption charges previously brought against the mayor were\ndropped\nin April.\n\u201cWhile Ingrid Lewis-Martin no longer works for this administration, she has been a friend and colleague for over 40 years, and I know her as a devoted public servant; she has declared her innocence, and my prayers are with her and her family,\u201d the mayor said in a statement.\nAs for Hamilton, Adams noted his not guilty plea, adding, \u201clike anyone accused, he is entitled to the presumption of innocence.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Michael Shvo\u2019s firm is going on the attack against Core Club.\nAfter the members-only club sued Shvo for $600 million last year, an entity tied to Shvo is seeking $178 million from Core Club in a new lawsuit filed in California.\nShvo alleges the ritzy social club failed to approve design plans required to build out the club\u2019s space at the Transamerica Pyramid, leading to delays. Shvo alleges Core Club\u2019s lack of action and delays constituted a default. And in November 2024, Shvo ultimately terminated Core Club\u2019s lease.\nNow, Shvo and his partners allege Core Club owes $178 million for payments owed on the remainder of Core Club\u2019s 20-year lease.\nThe social club was set to be a key tenant for Shvo\u2019s revamp of the Transamerica building and Shvo\u2019s office building at 711 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. Instead, the two have traded barbs in New York State court. Things heated up even more this week after Shvo initiated an\neviction\nof Core Club in the Fifth Avenue building.\nCore Club fired the first shots, claiming Shvo over-promised and under-delivered on opening three club locations with plans to spend $100 million on a buildout. Shvo\u2019s side responded, calling the lawsuit a public hit job, intended to get Core a rent reduction.\nShvo and his German partners, including the pension fund BVK, made a big splash buying the historic 48-story Transamerica Pyramid in 2020 for $650 million. Shvo undertook a $250 million renovation to modernize San Francisco\u2019s iconic tower. The purchase was part of a larger acquisition and development spree by Shvo, which included buying the former Coca-Cola building in Manhattan and building an ultra-luxury hotel and condo project in Miami Beach known as\nThe Raleigh\n.\n\nBut Shvo\u2019s high-end portfolio has faced recent\nchallenges\n. Construction at The Raleigh has stalled and it could be sold for $275 million. Shvo sold its luxury condo project in Beverly Hills after 10 sales in three years, the Wall Street Journal reported. Separately, Shvo has filed an arbitration claim, alleging he is owed more than $85 million in fees from the German pension fund BVK.\nThe Transamerica Pyramid was among Shvo\u2019s boldest bets. Shvo finalized the deal in 2020, as Covid forced employees to work from home. Core Club, a high-end members-only club, inked a lease in 2021, which would be offered as an amenity to office tenants.\n\u201cAfter years of failed commitments in both San Francisco and New York, the ownership of the Transamerica Pyramid has lost patience with Core Club,\u201d said Morris Missry of Wachtel Missry, an attorney for the Shvo entity. \u201cWe have tried to resolve this and to keep Core Club in the building, but it is now clear that Core Club is unwilling and/or unable to meet its obligations, and legal action is the only option to enforce the lease.\u201d\n\u201cIt is incredible that Mr. Shvo, who reneged on his promise to fund and build a luxury space for Core in the Transamerica Building due to his own lack of the resources, now seeks rent from Core for the very facility he failed to deliver,\u201d said Marc Kasowitz of the law firm Kasowitz.\nKasowitz said Core believes the project was a \u201cruse\u201d and will assert counterclaims for damages suffered as a result of \u201cShvo\u2019s failure to deliver\u201d the Core Club in San Francisco.\nA New York state judge recently ordered Core Club to pay Shvo close to\n$1 million\nover a loan Shvo provided in 2022. Core Club is appealing the ruling.\n",

The religious institution has made the purchases through Property Reserve, which invests church reserve funds in commercial real estate.\nSalt Lake City, Utah-based Property Reserve bought the Del Ola complex at 7801 North Federal Highway from an affiliate of New York-based Clarion Partners, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The deal breaks down to over $397,100 per unit.\nCompleted in 2012 and 2013, Del Ola consists of 19 three-story apartment buildings, a two-story clubhouse and five one-story garages on a 17.4-acre site, Vizzda and Palm Beach County records show. Clarion Partners, led by David Gilbert, had paid $120.8 million for the complex in 2019.\nDel Ola has one-bedroom to three-bedroom apartments, with monthly rents ranging from $2,169 to $4,802, according to its website.\nProperty Reserve, led by Ashley Powell, has purchased at least three properties in South Florida since 2023.\nIt owns the 1.3 million-square-foot Beacon Logistics Park, an industrial campus on 75 acres in Hialeah. It purchased it from developers Codina Partners and Affinius Capital in several deals. In 2023, Property Reserve paid\n$174.3 million\nfor several buildings and outparcels at Beacon Logistics and\n$55.8 million\nfor another warehouse.\n\nLast year, it bought the eight-story, 315-unit Ellsworth apartment building at 1301 Southwest 80th Terrace in Plantation for\n$133 million\n; as well as the 284-unit Elan Polo Gardens at 4310 Chukka Lane in unincorporated Palm Beach County, near Wellington, for\n$102.4 million\n.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has faced criticism over its massive real estate holdings, construction of\ngrandiose temples\nand opaque financials, allowed by limited public disclosure requirements. In 2023, the church and its investment manager, Ensign Peak Advisors, settled for $1 million and $4 million, respectively, over the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s claims the church\u2019s portfolio was obscured through about a dozen limited liability companies. The church and Ensign neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing in the settlement.\nFarmland Reserve, another investment arm for the church, last year paid\n$289 million\nfor 46 farms nationwide, including in Florida, the New York Post reported.\nSouth Florida\nmultifamily\ninvestment sales are experiencing an uptick in recent months, despite elevated interest rates, a slowdown of demand and lease-ups, and flat \u2013\u2013 and even declining \u2013\u2013 rent growth.\nMany of those still buying apartments are using Freddie Mac and Fannie loans, financing from insurance firms or are finding other workarounds such as assuming buyers\u2019 existing debt on a property or purchasing all cash. Property Reserve did not record a mortgage on the Del Ola purchase.\nThis month, AvalonBay Communities paid\n$98.3 million\nfor the 270-unit Avalon Coconut Creek apartment complex at 5401 Wiles Road in Coconut Creek, and Favo Capital purchased the 22-story, 277-unit 1818 Park apartment tower at 1818 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood for\n$190 million\n. AvalonBay didn\u2019t record a mortgage, and Favo completed the purchase though an all-stock and assumption of liabilities deal.\n",

        "content": "Developers Bart Przyjemski and Anita Lisek found a buyer willing to take on a rare conversion of a Chicago rental property to a for-sale condo building.\nNoah Properties, the Chicago-based development team founded by the husband-and-wife duo, sold The Avondale, a 52-unit townhome property at 4200 West Belmont Avenue, for $34 million to an out-of-state buyer, according to the Kiser Group brokerage.\nTransforming the property, known as The Avondale, into for-sale units would mark a turn in the Chicago condo market, as a streak of big deals for buildings that went the other way \u2014 from condos into rentals \u2014 took hold of the city in the late 2010s and into the early 2020s. Those transactions, known as condo deconversions that put separately owned homes in a building under the ownership of one landlord, have slowed down, though.\nIf the buyer, who hasn\u2019t yet been identified in public records, pulls off a conversion of The Avondale into condos, it would mark the second project taking the route in Chicago. Developer Crescent Heights began marketing units in\n850 North Lake Shore Drive\nfor sale as condos after buying that former rental building last year for $80 million, a substantial discount from its previous value.\n\nNoah is moving on from the property after taking out a $26.5 million construction loan to build it in 2021 and testing the market for the property a year later after it was completed. However, it never sold, as the developer opted to refinance it instead with a $26 million loan from Ready Capital, and an appraised value of $35 million, public loan data said.\n\u201cThey were originally intended to be for-sale condos, and the market wasn\u2019t there for them in 2022, when it was still the tail-end of the pandemic, and Noah filled it up with renters,\u201d said Kiser Group\u2019s Andy Friedman, who represented the buyer in the Avondale deal. Jake Parker of the Kiser Group represented Noah.\nThe Avondale features large units, with 32 three-bedroom layouts spanning more than 2,200 square feet each, 16 four-bedroom at more than 2,500 square feet, and four five-bedroom units of 4,000 square feet.\nWhile Noah appears to have cleared the Ready Capital debt with some room to spare on the sale, the developer still dealt with some financial pain due to a floating interest rate. Noah was likely putting in cash out of pocket to cover some debt service, after the interest rate hikes of 2023 ratcheted up the costs of floating deals, according to loan data collated by Morningstar Credit.\nThe loan data shows The Avondale generated nearly $2.3 million in revenue last year at 94 percent leased, but after over $800,000 in operating expenses and $2.4 million in debt service costs, there wasn\u2019t takehome pay for Noah until the sale.",

        "content": "For decades, the New York City Housing Authority tried to keep up its buildings without help from the private sector. It was like using paper cups to bail out the Titanic.\nEven when NYCHA started\nenlisting developers\nto fix properties early in the de Blasio administration and ramped up those efforts under Mayor Eric Adams, it couldn\u2019t make progress fast enough.\nThe numbers are mind-boggling. In 2011, NYCHA developments needed $29.2 billion worth of work. By 2017, the number had ballooned to $45.3 billion. Its latest physical needs assessment, in 2023, came to a stunning $78.3 billion, or $445,000 per apartment.\nOne reason for the increase was inflation, but most of it was the accelerating deterioration of old buildings. So the agency turned to the private sector to increase its capacity.\n\u201cThe faster we work, the quicker we can stay ahead of this,\u201d NYCHA chairman Jamie Rubin said in an interview.\nNow the nation\u2019s largest public housing system is opening a new line of business with real estate firms. It spelled out the effort Tuesday in a rather extraordinary request for proposals.\nNYCHA is looking to make deals with private parties that control a development site near the city\u2019s most decrepit public housing. One scenario might be:\nThe developer puts up a mixed-income or fully affordable building on the private site\nTenants move there from the nearby public housing\nThe developer gut-renovates \u2014 or demolishes and rebuilds \u2014 the vacated NYCHA building\nThe tenants move back to the new or renovated NYCHA building\nThe developer manages the new public housing\nThe private sector\u2019s incentives would include development fees, reliable Section 8 rental income and management fees for operating the properties.\nThere\u2019s another carrot: By working with NYCHA, developers could also build affordable housing much faster than by going through the city\u2019s Department of Housing Preservation and Development.\nHPD has a backlog of projects. A developer needing subsidies from the agency must often wait several years (although less than a year for certain projects). NYCHA is offering an immediate start, a different set of tools, help with the development plan and maybe even some capital.\n\nThe new\nrequest for expressions of interest\nwasn\u2019t hatched out of thin air. NYCHA spoke with some big developers about what would make sense for them and for the public housing system, which is by far the nation\u2019s largest. It crafted a flexible RFEI so private interests could offer a variety of approaches.\n\u201cI am confident we will get a lot of good ideas,\u201d Rubin said.\nOpposition\nis also likely. Critics tend to crop up when NYCHA works with for-profit developers, such as L+M Development Partners and Related Companies. They bemoan \u201cprivatization,\u201d although only property management and not ownership is privatized.\nMany tenants just don\u2019t trust the agency, which is understandable given its history. But that\u2019s actually an argument for getting help from the private sector, because the alternative is NYCHA going it alone.\nProtests have diminished since the initial years of the partnership program, called\nPACT\n/RAD, because tenants like their renovated campuses. But opposition continues at the West Chelsea development, where NYCHA will knock down a building that is no longer worth fixing and has enlisted Related to\nbuild 217 units\n.\nA\nbuild-and-demolish plan\nat the same Fulton Houses was scuttled during the de Blasio years because of blowback, only for the property to deteriorate further. People are fighting the new plan, too. Some opponents don\u2019t even live in public housing. They just don\u2019t want construction disrupting their lives.\nLocal opposition is just one threat to NYCHA\u2019s new strategy. Another is Zohran Mamdani, who may be mayor when the time comes to make deals with RFEI respondents. The deadline for submissions is Nov. 18, two weeks after the mayoral election.\nIf the socialist Assembly member wins, all bets may be off. His housing plan makes no mention of tapping the private sector. Quite the opposite.\n\u201cWhen the City allows private developers to build,\u201d\nMamdani\u2019s housing plan\nwarns, \u201cwe are inviting the private sector to profit.\u201d\nThat is precisely what NYCHA is doing. Profit is the backbone of its plan: Developers get the chance to make money in exchange for doing work that NYCHA has been unable to do on its own.\n",

        "content": "Gregory C. O\u2019Connell Jr., a progressive developer who was responsible for much of the revitalization of Brooklyn\u2019s Red Hook neighborhood, died on August 2 at his home in Geneseo, New York. He was 83.\nThe cause of death was pancreatic cancer, his son Gregory T. O\u2019Connell told\nThe New York Times.\nBorn in Queens in 1942, O\u2019Connell was the son of a police officer and a teacher. He made his first real estate venture when he was a student at the State University of New York (SUNY) Geneseo, investing $22,000 along with two friends to buy and renovate a building they then rented out to fellow students.\nAfter graduating in 1964 with a teaching degree, O\u2019Connell joined the New York City Police Department and later became a detective. He bought his first property in the city in 1967, paying $28,500 for a Cobble Hill house that he renovated himself. He continued to acquire other properties throughout the 1970s in Carroll Gardens and the Columbia Street waterfront district. He eventually retired from the force in 1981 to become a developer full-time.\nHe bought his first property in Red Hook, then a gritty and industrial enclave, a year after retiring from the NYPD. In 1992, he purchased 28 acres along the waterfront for $500,000 and set about redeveloping the area with an eye for commercial and light manufacturing.\n\u201cI could make three times the amount of profit with residential than I\u2019m doing with commercial and industrial,\u201d he told the\nCommercial Observer\nin 2008. \u201cAnd I could get the zoning changes, but for me the key is balance, so you take a little less, and everybody gets a piece of the pie.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Connell\u2019s work in Red Hook is credited with\nrevitalizing\nthe area. At one point, he was said to own\n$400 million\nworth of property in the neighborhood.\nHe was especially known for bringing a\nFairway Supermarket\nto a Civil War-era warehouse in the district, providing the neighborhood with jobs and affordable food. In the course of that project, O\u2019Connell exposed a local council member, Angel Rodriguez, for soliciting a bribe in exchange for support on the project.\nWhen Hurricane Sandy\nrocked the area\n, causing an estimated $50 million in damages, O\u2019Connell provided rent abatements and low-interest loans to his tenants as they got back on their feet.\nBrooklyn business owners, real estate developers, and community members expressed condolences after O\u2019Connell\u2019s passing. On LinkedIn, Brooklyn tour guide Dom Gervasi called him \u201ca man of vision \u2013 [whose] vision actually materialized.\u201d He added, \u201cI admire Greg O\u2019Connell Sr. not only for standing apart from so many others in his industry as a force for good, but for his humanity.\u201d\nO\u2019Connell is survived by his wife, two sons, four grandchildren, and two brothers.\nThe younger Greg O\u2019Connell posted on LinkedIn to pay tribute to his father.\n\u201cHe believed in me. He believed in us all.\u201d",

        "content": "Billionaire Russell Weiner is expanding his Miami Beach real estate portfolio with the $35.3 million purchase of a waterfront mansion on Star Island,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nWeiner closed on the purchase of the 1.1-acre property at 43 Star Island Drive on Thursday, according to sources. The late Dr. David Frankel, a prominent dermatologist, owned the 11,104-square foot, eight-bedroom mansion with his wife, Linda Frankel. It previously belonged to former talk show host and comedian Rosie O\u2019Donnell.\nThe price is closer to $36 million, including commissions, according to a source.\nThe home, built in 1923, was listed with Compass agent Liz Hogan for $48 million. Weiner, who confirmed he bought the property, received a 26 percent discount off the asking price. It went into contract\nin mid-June\n, according to the Multiple Listing Service. Hogan, who brokered both sides of the deal, could not be reached for comment.\nHomeowners on Star Island include Gloria and Emilio Estefan, billionaires Ken Griffin and Philip and Patricia Frost, Rick Ross and Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, who is in jail. Earlier this year, billionaire developer Vlad Doronin sold his waterfront Star Island estate\nfor $120 million\n, setting a new record for home sales in Miami-Dade County.\nWeiner, who made his fortune with the $3.9 billion sale of Rockstar Energy to PepsiCo in 2020, has set his sights on ultra-luxury residential real estate in South Florida.\nHe\u2019s building a massive compound on Pine Tree Drive and is also the true owner of\n5300 North Bay Road\n. Both properties are in Miami Beach. Developer and hospitality mogul Keith Menin paid $16.1 million for the waterfront North Bay Road home last year and has been renovating the property into the Mediterranean-modern style his company, Menin Homes, uses.\n\nWeiner is working with Menin on the North Bay Road project and a planned expansion and renovation of the Star Island property, he confirmed. The North Bay Road home will likely be completed in September and could hit the market for $35 million, according to a source.\nThe Star Island estate has 200 feet of water frontage, two guest houses, a boat house and tropical landscaping, according to the listing. The expanded estate could span 15,000 square feet once completed, with a master suite, gym, spa, padel court and cabana.\nIt will likely hit the market for more than $100 million, the source said.\nWeiner has been buying and selling homes in South Florida for years. In 2020, he flipped two homes in North Palm Beach for more than $48 million, reaping a 45 percent gain in one month. The billionaire entrepreneur bought the properties from Swedish model Elin Nordegren, the ex-wife of golfer Tiger Woods, for\nnearly $33 million\na month earlier.\nConstruction of his Pine Tree Drive estate is at the\ncenter of lawsuits\ninvolving Weiner and his former project manager. Earlier this year, he foreclosed on the middle property at 5101 Pine Tree Drive\nvia foreclosure\n.\nMenin is a principal at Miami-based Menin Hospitality and owner of Bodega Taqueria and Tequila. His Menin Homes has bought, renovated and sold other homes in South Florida. The company was recently involved in the renovation of attorney Anthony Lopez and former \u201cReal Housewife of Miami,\u201d Dr. Nicole Martin\u2019s waterfront Coral Gables estate, which\nsold for $40 million\n.\n",

        "content": "A Pacific Palisades property once owned by the late actor and comedian Dom DeLuise hit the market Thursday with an asking price more than triple what it last sold for.\nAnthony Marguleas\n, founder of Palisades-based Amalfi Estates, is marketing 1186 Corsica Drive, which is asking $21 million.\nThe broker also represented the buyer when DeLuise\u2019s estate sold the home for $6.5 million in 2021 to an entity managed by Jeff Mironer, according to property records.\nMironer runs developer Provincetown Estates, which specializes in residential projects in the Palisades, and is behind the rebuild of the former DeLuise property.\nDeLuise appeared in several Mel Brooks films, such as \u201cThe Twelve Chairs,\u201d \u201cBlazing Saddles\u201d and \u201cSilent Movie.\u201d There was also \u201cFatso,\u201d which Brooks\u2019 wife Anne Bancroft directed. The actor also authored several cookbooks and children\u2019s books, in addition to lending his voice in \u201cAn American Tail\u201d and \u201cAll Dogs Go to Heaven.\u201d\nThe new build spans over 10,000 square feet and has six bedrooms, seven full bathrooms, two powder rooms, a three-car garage and elevator.\n\nThe property sits less than half a mile away from the Riviera Country Club and is also about a five-minute drive to the Brentwood Country Mart.\nThe home\u2019s landscaping is inspired by the Mediterranean, with olive trees and gardens, in addition to an outdoor kitchen with a pizza oven. Inside, the home touts white oak floors, custom wood moldings and millwork, a speakeasy bar, 1,657-bottle wine room and theater. A whole wing of the residence is dedicated to wellness, with a gym, sauna, cold plunge and massage room.\nIt\u2019s a big change from the ranch-style home that DeLuise\nreportedly\npaid $103,000 for in 1968. That price adjusted for inflation would still be under $1 million today, for a 4,500 square feet with five beds and fourth baths, built in 1953, according to the home\u2019s previous listing.\nAs the Palisades bounces back from the fires, it\u2019s seeing land listings continue to hit the market. However, as noted in Marguleas\u2019 July market report recapping June, the gap between the number of new listings and closings is shrinking.\nMarguleas said he expects land listings to peak at about 500 by the middle of next year, based on how the market is currently faring with over 75 properties added to the market each month.\nIn June, 77 land listings hit the market, compared to 39 sold, according to Marguleas\u2019 report. That could be viewed as an improvement compared to March\u2019s 115 land listings and 11 closings, or April\u2019s 112 listings and 26 sales.\n",

        "content": "Jannone Development is preparing to turn an apartment complex in Koreatown into condominiums.\nThe Los Angeles-based developer secured a $20 million refinancing loan from JLL for The Secret, a 39-unit multifamily property built last year, L.A. Business First\nreported\n.\nThe property at 3050 West 11th Street was initially designed as for-sale condominiums but pivoted to apartments during construction. The building hosts a combination of one-, two- and three-bedroom units across more than 46,500 square feet. Jannone will now move to return to its original plan.\nJannone looks to complete the apartment-to-condo conversion and sales process over the next 18 to 24 months, per Business First. In locking down the financing, the developer is \u201cperfectly positioned to meet the growing demand for ownership opportunities\u201d in\nKoreatown\n, according to JLL\u2019s Chris Collins, who represented the borrower.\nKoreatown is quickly becoming a go-to destination for property buyers in Los Angeles.\n\nThe ZIP code 90020 in the L.A. enclave was the hottest housing market in the city in the second quarter,\naccording\nto Business First. The average sale price was $2.2 million with 62 new listings hitting the market last quarter. Another Koreatown ZIP code, 90004, rounded out the top five hottest markets in Greater L.A. alongside parts of Newport Beach and Silverado.\nElsewhere in Koreatown, other use conversions and multifamily redevelopment projects have moved forward in recent months.\nLast month, Jamison Properties filed plans to convert a 20-story office building at\n3550 Wilshire Boulevard\ninto 495 apartments. That project follows Jamison\u2019s similar adaptive reuse endeavors at\n3325 Wilshire\nand a two-tower high-rise complex at\n3600 Wilshire\n. In 2023, the developer filed plans to convert a 17-story office tower at\n6380 Wilshire\ninto 210 apartments.\nIn June, Barkley Development\nfiled an application\nto turn 412 South Catalina Street into a six-story, 53-unit apartment building with a 22-car garage. That project would be an extension of a similar redevelopment next door at 400 South Catalina Street completed in 2019, which turned two smaller apartment buildings into a 61-unit property with a gym, roof deck and subterranean parking.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",

        "content": "Victor Ciardelli, the mortgage mogul behind Rate, has sold his Hinsdale home at a markdown.\nThe five-bedroom, six-bath property at 622 South Washington Street in Hinsdale closed Wednesday for $2.45 million. Ciardelli and his wife, Sandra, listed the home in April at just under $2.8 million before trimming the ask to $2.58 million, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The deal closed at about 87 percent of the original asking price.\nAccording to the listing provided by the sellers\u2019 agents \u2014 Coldwell Banker\u2019s Stefania Campo and Paula Ciardelli, Victor\u2019s ex-wife \u2014 the home was built in 1907 and sits on an 8,520-square-foot lot, but the home\u2019s square footage was not disclosed. The buyers, not yet identified in public filings, were represented by Jennifer Williams of Coldwell Banker.\nCiardelli bought the house in 2013 for roughly $1.64 million. Photos from the listing show a Hamptons-style exterior, airy white interiors, and traditional finishes like wainscoting and multi-paneled windows. Perks include a balcony off the primary bedroom, a basement pub and a sauna.\n\nThe sale is a relatively small-ticket move for Ciardelli, who in 2021 dropped $37.5 million on a Miami Beach\nestate\nin the Altos Del Mar enclave. His Chicago-area house hunt has been overshadowed by\nRate\u2019s\nown turbulence. Founded in 2000 with $2.5 million from family and friends, the firm ballooned to more than 10,000 employees by 2021. But as mortgage volume shrank in the current environment, Rate reportedly cut staff by nearly half.\nLast year, Rate \u2014 the Chicago lender whose name is on the White Sox ballpark,\nRate Field\n\u2014 originated $26.4 billion in mortgages, good for sixth place nationally, according to Scotsman Guide. But the lender has been dogged by internal scrutiny: a June 2024 Chicago Tribune investigation described a\ntoxic culture\nunder Ciardelli, alleging he frequently berated employees. Ciardelli denied the claims.\nThe Hinsdale sale looks more like housekeeping than distress for the Rate CEO. With his Miami mansion already secured, Ciardelli is clearly shifting his personal footprint south. But unloading a suburban house at a discount underscores the reality of today\u2019s market, where sellers rarely get everything they ask for.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Brookfield Properties is working to meet housing demand in the Bay Area with a change of plans in San Mateo.\nThe New York-based developer has revised its redevelopment plan for Concar Passage, a new mixed-use community at the Concar Shopping Center. The new version would cut down on retail in favor of housing, the San Francisco Chronicle\nreported\n. The strip mall currently is home to businesses like Trader Joe\u2019s, T.J. Maxx and 7-Eleven.\nThe new plan calls for 847 homes consisting of a mix of rental apartments and for-sale townhomes. About 186 apartments will be set aside for affordable housing.\nIt\u2019s a shave from a previous proposal approved in 2020 that had called for 961 apartments at the site, including 73 affordable units. That plan also included the construction of a food hall and a daycare facility. The new plan would \u201cbring much-needed new housing, open space and neighborhood-serving retail\u201d to the area, Josh Roden, president of Brookfield Residential NorCal, told the Chronicle.\nBrookfield plans to demolish a chunk of the shopping center\u2019s commercial space, forcing Ross Dress for Less, T.J. Maxx and The Pantry restaurant to close or move.\n\nThe\nConcar Passage\nsite is just one several retail spaces across the Bay Area that developers have floated for redevelopment.\nIn San Francisco, for example, Brookfield is moving forward with 3,500 new residential units on 30 acres of parking lot space at the highly trafficked Stonestown Galleria mall. About 20 percent of that housing will be below market rate.\nAcross the Golden Gate Bridge in Marin County, Prado Group is looking at turning a closed Macy\u2019s store and its accompanying parking lot for potential development into housing. Last year, the city of San Rafael approved Merlone Geier Partners\u2019 plan to build about 1,400 units at the Northgate Mall.\nIf Brookfield\u2019s Concar Passage project is approved by the end of next year, construction is expected to begin in 2027 and wrap up in 2032. Under its\nHousing Element\n, San Mateo must plan for 7,015 new residential units by 2031.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "Hines smashed another Houston real estate record, this time with a splashy retail-and-office buy in Montrose.\nThe global developer\u2019s nontraded Real Estate Investment Trust, Hines Global Income Trust, paid $137.6 million for Montrose Collective, a 189,000-square-foot mixed-use project at 888 Westheimer Road, according to an SEC filing Bisnow\nreported\n. The deal pencils out to about $728 per square foot \u2014 more than triple the metro\u2019s average retail price per square foot of $223 last quarter.\nThe project, developed by Radom Capital, was completed in 2023 after a pandemic-delayed build that mixed new construction with adaptive reuse across 2.4 acres. It includes about 100,000 square feet of offices leased to tenants such as Live Nation and renewable energy firm Pattern Energy, plus 50,000 square feet of retail anchored by restaurants, boutiques and fitness brands like Uchi and Solidcore. The development also houses the Freed-Montrose branch of the Houston Public Library, part of a land-swap deal with the city.\nThe property is fully leased, according to Hines\u2019 SEC disclosure. The buy resets the city\u2019s price-per-foot high-water mark, a record Hines itself set last year with its $145 million purchase of\n200 Park Place\n, an office tower that traded for about $700 per square foot. The Montrose Collective trade also arrives as Houston retail investment volume climbs from a subdued 2023.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the only eye-popping retail deal this summer. Brixmor Property Group, a New York firm, dropped $233 million for\nLaCenterra at Cinco Ranch in Katy\n, a 409,000-square-foot lifestyle center. That deal worked out to $545 per square foot, more than double the metro average.\nInvestors and developers have been watching closely for what Montrose Collective would fetch, given its high-profile tenants and prime urban location. For the Hines REIT, which has been busy scooping up trophy\nassets\nin its home market, the Montrose deal underscores a willingness to pay top dollar for curated, experience-driven real estate.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

The site, between Lincoln Park and Bucktown, would include nearly 3,300 residential units, 350,000 square feet of office, 435,000 square feet of retail, 250,000 square feet of hotel space and 12 acres of open space.\nRenderings depict Southport Avenue as the spine of the project, lined with mid- and high-rise buildings up to 38 stories, while townhomes and single-family houses hug an extended riverwalk. JDL is working with local architecture firm HPA on the site\u2019s master plan, Chicago YIMBY\nreported\n.\nBut the city\u2019s Department of Planning &amp; Development has already raised concerns. In a recent response letter, officials suggested replacing riverfront for-sale homes with multifamily, to avoid clashes between private owners and public riverwalk users. They also pressed the developers on phasing, interim uses and traffic fixes.\n\nInfrastructure is the perennial sticking point. Sterling Bay, the project\u2019s original developer, won Chicago City Council approval in 2019 with a controversial agreement that the developer would bankroll new bridges and roads upfront, but would later be reimbursed by the city with as much as $490 million in tax incentive fund dollars as projects were completed. Whether Foundry Park requires the same level of investment remains to be seen, though the Chicago Department of Transportation flagged future connections to the 606 trail, a Southport-Throop bridge and a redesign of the messy Elston-Ashland-Armitage intersection as factors to consider.\nFor now, JDL CEO Jim Letchinger told the outlet that the\nproposal\nwas \u201cindicative of what we are attempting to do,\u201d while cautioning that details could shift as the city reviews the plan. What\u2019s clear is that the tract \u2014 once home to the A. Finkl &amp; Sons steel mill and most recently in the hands of\nBankOZK\nafter it foreclosed on Sterling Bay \u2014 is finally back in play.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A groundbreaking date has been set for the University of California, San Francisco\u2019s new cancer center at the\nDogpatch Power Station\nsite.\nAssociate Capital is planning to begin construction on the 300,000-square-foot building on Aug. 26, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. UCSF bought the 50,000-square-foot parcel where the eight-story center will be built from Associate Capital this spring for $75 million.\nIn total, the center could cost nearly half a billion dollars. The developer estimates construction costs around $400 million, according to the Business Times. In May, the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank\napproved the issuance\nof up to $575 million in tax-exempt, fixed-rate revenue bonds to fund the cancer center.\nThe proton therapy center will be built in the building\u2019s basement. The development will include clinical space on the second through fifth floors and incubator space on the sixth through eighth floors. When completed, it will be one of fewer than 50 such centers in the United States today. In Northern California, Stanford University\u2019s own proton therapy facility is expected to be up and running this fall.\n\nThe Power Station site, located at a former Pacific Gas &amp; Electric power station in Dogpatch, is in the midst of a large-scale redevelopment that would include housing. The Sophie Maxwell, a 105-unit affordable housing project, is set to be completed in October, according to the Business Times. Those residences will be the first of up to 2,600 homes and 1.6 million square feet for which the Power Station site is approved.\nConstruction of UCSF\u2019s cancer center is expected to be completed at the end of 2028 with plans to open to patients the following year.\nIn addition to the land on which the building will rise, the University of California system recently\nadded another piece of land\nin the Bay Area to its holdings: Nearly 100 acres in Belmont, which includes the 46-acre campus of Notre Dame de Namur University as well as the 50.5-acre Water Dog Lake preserve. The university system doesn\u2019t plan to build its own campus on the site, though a UC \u201cinstitute or other such research center\u201d could rise there in the future, Dianne Klein, UC\u2019s investments director,\ntold\nthe Business Times.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A 21-story vacant office building in the Garment District was a prime candidate for a residential conversion, after a key upzoning in Manhattan.\nThe listing for Expansion Group\u2019s 554-568 Eighth Avenue boasted that the more than 300,000-square-foot building was ready to be converted into residential space, potentially with the use of a new property tax break available for office-to-residential conversions.\nBut the property was among the sites the City Council carved out of the northwest section of the Midtown South rezoning.\nInstead of allowing residential space with a floor area ratio, or FAR, of up to 18, the Council decided to increase the permitted density for light-industrial use and to eliminate residential as an option for 37 properties within the Garment District.\nBy the city\u2019s count, only 76 apartments were shaved off the rezoning\u2019s housing projections as a result of that change. Another projected 117 units were eliminated when the City Council reduced the maximum residential FAR from 18 to 15 in the southeast quadrant of the rezoning.\nBut the Garment District Alliance, a business improvement district whose board members include local property owners,\u00a0say that far more housing was at stake. A report commissioned by the Garment District Alliance and produced by BFJ Planning concluded that six sites included in the northwest carveout could have contributed between 900 and 1,000 units of housing if the City Council left the rezoning intact.\nInstead, 37 property owners were \u201cblindsided.\u201d\n\u201cWe had to basically announce it to those 37 property owners, many of whom are really ticked off for obvious reasons,\u201d said Barbara Blair, president of the Garment District Alliance. \u201cSome of them had sort of started down the road of thinking about converting to housing and had plans that were in the works.\u201d\nProperties like the Eighth Avenue building, and others identified by BFJ, underscore how housing projections for zoning changes are an approximation, an art rather than exact science. City Planning has its own criteria for determining the likelihood that a site will be developed, but such estimates can\u2019t anticipate whims of the market or of developers, nor fully account for every possible development scenario. Neither can BFJ\u2019s report.\nThe agency labeled 61 properties as \u201cprojected development sites\u201d and estimated that 9,676 apartments would be built across those sites over the next 10 years if the rezoning were approved. Those calculations did not include properties like Expansion Group\u2019s Eighth Avenue building, which was not identified by City Planning as a likely redevelopment site as part of the rezoning.\nWhen asked about BFJ\u2019s report, a City Planning spokesperson pointed to its methodology.\n\u201cThe Dept of City Planning\u2019s environmental review for the Midtown South Mixed-Use Plan (as proposed and modified) adheres to the extremely detailed standards and methodology of City Environmental Quality Review,\u201d a City Planning spokesperson said. \u201cOur work is based on hard data and documented in detail in our environmental impact statement and technical memo. The claims presented in their memo are not supported by facts or any known methodology.\u201d\nThe spokesperson noted that the BFJ projections include density bonuses that would require additional approvals, while city projections rely on development that can happen as-of-right. The report also doesn\u2019t go into detail about how potential development sites were selected or aspects of its methodology.\nEven with the\nchanges\nthat reduced residential density, the rezoning is a major milestone for the city. The rezoning,\napproved\nlast week by the City Council, marks the first time that the city has mapped new districts that allow residential FARs of 15 and 18. These higher density districts were made possible by changes made in the state budget last year and in the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity text amendment.\n\nStill, the reasons given for the carveouts are controversial. Local Council member Erik Bottcher indicated last week that the modifications were aimed at assuaging concerns that fashion-related businesses in Garment District would be driven out by landlords eager to redevelop their buildings. The carveout for this area will help ensure that \u201cnew housing and new business growth can thrive side-by-side,\u201d Bottcher said.\nThe rezoning area is home to nearly a quarter of New York City\u2019s fashion manufacturing and wholesale jobs. That is equal to about 2,300 jobs, representing less than 2 percent of the area\u2019s total jobs and an 80 percent decline in the sector over the previous two decades, according to City Planning. Some have questioned the wisdom of trying to plan around these garment-focused businesses, given this decline.\n\u201cThis area has long since ceased to include any meaningful manufacturing activity, let alone garment factories or assembly,\u201d Herrick\u2019s Mitch Korbey said in a statement last week.\nBlair called the carveout a \u201cvast overreach.\u201d\n\u201cThe modifications that were made were made at the 11th hour,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were not aware of them at all. It was a done deal by the time we learned about it.\u201d\nShe believes that if the BID had been included in the modification negotiations, it could have helped \u201cright-size any kind of exclusion.\u201d\nShe noted that those owners will also see building values in the surrounding area increase but won\u2019t be able to enjoy the same appreciation because their properties\u2019 use is limited.\nThe owners of some of those properties, meanwhile, are leaning into the existing office use. A\nlisting\nfor 262 West 38th Street boasts that the property is nearly fully occupied with \u201ca vibrant mix of fashion, technology, nonprofit, architecture, engineering, and other industry tenants.\u201d\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the landlord is happy with the rezoning changes. Owner Silver Eight Capital\u2019s Guillermo Silberman said that his company was unlikely to directly take advantage of a residential conversion but believed the building still would have benefited. Allowing residential use in the area could have culled unused office space for the market and led to a \u201cmore vibrant, mixed-use neighborhood,\u201d he said. The properties neighboring his building are vacant or nearly so, and now they don\u2019t have the option to convert to another use.\n\u201cTo be clear, there is insufficient demand for manufacturing and office space, so the opposition to the rezoning on these blocks did not make much sense to me,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cIf they wanted or needed the space, they\u2019d be occupying these properties.\u201d\nJLL\u2019s Drew Isaacson and Hall Oster, who are marketing 554-568 Eighth Avenue, still have a bright outlook for the rezoning. (They declined to speak specifically about the Eighth Avenue property, and representatives for Expansion Group didn\u2019t return messages seeking comment.)\nThe brokers said even with the rezoning carveouts, commercial buildings will benefit from demand for office space in the area, especially as other properties convert to residential.\n\u201cThis is an area that should be far more vibrant than it is for all asset classes,\u201d Isaacson said. \u201cIt\u2019s square in the center of Manhattan.\u201d\n",

The seller,\nDown York Enterprises Ltd.\n, paid just under $4 million for the pad in 2010. The latest transaction works out to about $1,900 per square foot. The latest asking price was just under $5.7 million. Douglas Elliman\u2019s\nJamie Safier\nand\nKim Shepard\nhad the listing.\n\ud83d\udcca Commercial:\nA Park Slope brownstone traded for $5.5 million.

        "content": "Of all the criticisms leveled against Zohran Mamdani, his occupancy of a\nrent-stabilized apartment\nis probably the weakest.\nThat\u2019s because he is essentially paying market-rate rent,\nThe Real Deal\nhas learned.\nFor his unit at 32-15 35th Street in Astoria, the socialist mayoral candidate pays what is called a preferential rent, meaning a lower amount than the landlord could charge under state law.\nThat might look like a sweetheart deal: Mamdani pays about $2,250 a month, while the legal rent \u2014 the maximum allowed under rent stabilization \u2014 is nearly $3,100 for his one-bedroom apartment.\nBut the 30 free-market units in the 52-unit building have an average rent of $2,115, according to the owner\u2019s property tax assessment challenge. That is even less than Mamdani is paying, which is an indication that the owner could not get the legal rent of $3,082 if he or she tried.\nThat is usually the case with preferential rents, although they are also offered when a landlord wants to give a particular tenant a break.\nWhy didn\u2019t Mamdani bring this up when rival candidate Andrew Cuomo\nattacked him\nfor leasing a rent-stabilized apartment? That is unclear. Mamdani might not have known he was paying a preferential rent until\nTRD\nemailed his campaign an inquiry, which went unanswered Thursday. He has said he did not know the unit was rent-stabilized when he rented it.\nIt is likely, however, that Mamdani\u2019s unit would be rented out for closer to the $3,082 maximum if he were to win the November election and move to Gracie Mansion. Despite a pandemic dip, rent growth has been strong since the pre-Covid period when Mamdani initially rented the apartment. Astoria specifically has seen the steepest rent growth in Queens, with the average price of a one-bedroom hitting $3,304 this year, compared to $2,845 a year ago, per a report from M.N.S. Real Estate. But the Rent Guidelines Board has kept rent increases\nbelow the inflation rate\nfor a decade.\nAt one time, Mamdani\u2019s landlord could have jacked up his rent to the legal limit, but in June 2019, the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act gave\nadditional protection\nto tenants paying preferential rent. The landlord would have to wait for Mamdani to leave to raise the rent to the legal limit.\nBut even then, there is no guarantee that someone would pay it. StreetEasy on Wednesday showed 86 listings for one-bedrooms in Astoria asking less than $3,000 a month.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nProperty tax arrears are public information. Should outstanding mortgage debt be public as well? With easy access to property debt, people who\nbought Hamptons houses in foreclosure\nfrom Michael O\u2019Sullivan, only to lose them to lenders or foreclosure auction bidders, might have avoided that disaster.\nOn the other hand, such clueless people might have failed to check the debt anyway. And making mortgage balances public could be considered an invasion of privacy and have unintended consequences. Send your thoughts to\neengquist@therealdeal.com\n.\n\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\n: The New York State Bar Association is working on a report about housing court. It will become public after it\u2019s adopted by the group\u2019s House of Delegates. Given housing court\u2019s reputation for dysfunction and delay, and the endless horror stories told by landlords and their lawyers, the bar association\u2019s report could present a damning picture.\nElsewhere\u2026\n\u2014 An appellate judge has upheld an order blocking the Department of Social Services from ending a key housing voucher program, according to a press release from supportive shelter and housing provider Win. The ruling preserves the \u201cunit hold incentive,\u201d which compensates landlords who accept CityFHEPS tenants while holding a unit vacant during the voucher holder\u2019s application process.\n\u2014 This month\u2019s Legionnaires\u2019 disease outbreak in Central Harlem, which has killed five people, hospitalized 14 and made sickened 100 New Yorkers in all, comes after the city\u2019s Department of Health lost over one-third of its cooling tower inspectors in the past three years,\nGothamist\nfound. Though the city aims to inspect towers annually, seven out of the 10 linked to the current outbreak were not inspected in the past year.\n\u2014 Mayor Eric Adams and Council Speaker Adrienne Adams will roll out a pilot this fall to streamline the city\u2019s discretionary funding process for some nonprofits,\nCity &amp; State\nreported. The initiative replaces the current months-long contracting process with direct one-year grant agreements, cutting out 13 steps. About 100 organizations will test the new system in the first year.\n\u2014 Quinn Waller\nClosing time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Thursday was\n$15 million\nfor a 3,466-square-foot resale condominium unit at 157 West 57th Street. Bespoke Real Estate had\nthe listing\n.\nCommercial:\nThe top commercial deal recorded was\n$19.8 million\nfor a portfolio of mixed-use properties at 194-196 Avenue A and 503-505 East 12th Street in the East Village. The four properties have a total of 16,336 square feet and 15 residential units. Avenue Realty Capital sold the properties to Hamilton Lane.\nNew to the Market:\nThe highest price for a residential property hitting the market was\n$7.4 million\nfor a 4,800-square-foot co-op at 477 Washington Street in Hudson Square. Thomas Hemann with Compass has the listing.\nBreaking Ground:\nThe largest new building project filed was for a proposed 68,458-square-foot, 13-story mixed-use building at 2361 Second Avenue in East Harlem.

        "content": "David Werner didn\u2019t hesitate when a deal came his way in Hudson Yards.\nThe real estate investor snapped up 440 Ninth Avenue in the trendy neighborhood for slightly more than $100 million in cash, Bloomberg\nreported\n. The deal for the office building, located between 34th and 35th Streets, breaks down to $243 per square foot.\nIt\u2019s likely a tough pill to swallow for the sellers, Taconic Investment Partners and Nuveen Real Estate, which purchased the property only seven years ago\nfor $269 million\n. The transaction was a short sale, meaning the purchase price was below the outstanding mortgage balance; lender MetLife agreed to the sale.\nCBRE\u2019s Doug Middleton and Jack Stillwagon arranged the sale. Nuveen and MetLife declined to comment to the outlet, while the other parties didn\u2019t immediately respond to the publication\u2019s requests for comment.\nThe former Harding Building went up almost a century ago, spanning 411,000 square feet and rising 18 stories high. Tenants have included BlackRock and KKR.\nWerner has been on a buying spree across New York City\u2019s office market, diving into the office-to-residential conversion space.\n\nIn the spring, Madison Realty Capital provided Werner and Nathan Berman\u2019s Metro Loft with a\n$720 million loan\nto redevelop the former Pfizer headquarters property at 235 East East 42nd Street in Midtown East. The financing likely represented a record for both the lender and the type of project being supported.\nWerner\u2019s deal in Hudson Yards may not be the last for an office property in the neighborhood.\nTwo months ago, Related Companies and partner Oxford Properties\nbegan exploring a sale\nof a portion of 35 Hudson Yards, including office, retail, fitness and hotel condominiums completed directly before the pandemic. The components could come to a $600 million price tag, sources previously told Bloomberg.\nThen again, a discount is always possible. Office sale values have dropped by 37% since 2022, according to Green Street\u2019s Commercial Property Price Index.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "A Palm Beach condo association reached a settlement with a resident nearly a year into litigation regarding an allegedly unsanctioned air conditioning project and $15 million in unaccounted special assessment funds.\nCourt records show the Halcyon of Palm Beach Condominium Association settled the case brought by resident Dr. Michael Montanaro, a local orthodontist. Montanaro filed suit in October, alleging that the association had violated owners\u2019 right to vote on a $2.5 million air conditioning project. The complaint sought a court-appointed receiver to assume control of the association and its finances.\nEarlier this month, Palm Beach Circuit Court Judge Maxine Cheesman approved the appointment of a receiver. As part of the settlement, the association will instead hire a forensic auditor to determine how the $15 million was spent, according to Montanaro\u2019s attorney, Bill Pincus.\n\u201cHaving a receiver would be much worse for them than having an accountant, as a receiver is in control of the association,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, the association will have a forensic accountant, agreeable to us, look through these books and figure out what happened with this money.\u201d\nThe unaccounted $15 million was raised in two separate special assessments in 2021, one for $6 million and one for $9 million. A previous investigation into the funds described the association\u2019s accounting as in \u201cshambles,\u201d court records show.\n\n\u201cThe main issue was that the association was simply unable to account for all of the $15 million it spent. Its effort to show what happened to all of that money was insufficient,\u201d said David Glickman, another attorney for Montanaro.\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t necessarily evidence of nefarious activity,\u201d he said, but it \u201craises a lot of questions,\u201d given the amount of money involved.\nA spokesperson for the association said it expects to hire the auditor in early September.\nThe Halcyon is a 104-unit, two-building oceanfront condo at 3440 South Ocean Boulevard on the South End of\nPalm Beach\n. The six-story and seven-story buildings were built in 1980, the same year Montanaro bought his two-bedroom unit for $87,000, property records show. It is one of dozens of older condo buildings on the island navigating the state\u2019s new\ncondo safety laws\n. Among other recent condo lawsuits in the area, the\nowners of La Clara\nin\nWest Palm Beach\nfiled suit in February against developer Great Gulf, alleging misrepresentation and defective construction.\nAs part of the Halcyon settlement, the association also agreed to pay Montanaro\u2019s $250,000 in legal fees, and he is excused from special assessments related to paying his fees, as well as the association\u2019s legal fees connected with the case, Pincus confirmed. Other terms of the settlement include a vote on the air conditioning project, which was previously greenlit by the association without a vote by the owners.\n\u201cMy client is very glad,\u201d Pincus said. \u201cI think ecstatic is a proper word.\u201d",

The 173 condos would include 36 studios, 43 two-bedroom units, and 94 one-bedroom units.\nSpread throughout the development, and across all three types of condos, would be 28 units reserved as workforce housing for buyers who earn up to 140 percent of the area median income\n\nAventura-based Blue Park LLC owns the 1.5-acre development site at 216, 220 and 228 Southeast Eighth Street and 221 Southeast Ninth Street in\nHallandale Beach\n. Blue Park LLC, led by Jonathan Cohen, Bryan Cohen and Roberto Cohen, assembled the four-parcel site last year, acquiring it for a total of $5.4 million, according to state and county records.\nChaberman has the site under contract, documents show. He was identified as the developer of Blue Park in a June 17 letter of intent to Hallandale Beach\u2019s Planning and Zoning Division from Ari Sklar, the project\u2019s Hollywood-based architect. In the letter, Sklar also disclosed that Blue Park will be condos. Neither the architect nor the developer could be reached for comment.\nChaberman has been active in Hallandale Beach. On the block just north of the Blue Park site, Kadima Developers is developing an eight-story, 121-unit condominium called\nSeven Park\nat 218-220 Southeast Seventh Street. Chaberman and Joseph Melul are co-founders of Kadima.\nConstruction of Seven Park is scheduled to start in October, a spokesperson confirmed. Kadima assigned Fortune Development Sales to lead sales and marketing of units, with prices starting at $375,000. The ground floor of the mixed-use development will have a quartet of 4,500-square-foot retail spaces.Chaberman is also a co-founder of Grupo Eco, which developed\nAtlantic Village\n, a mixed-use property in Hallandale Beach with restaurants, retail stores, and office space. Atlantic Village is next to\nJeffrey Soffer\u2019s Big Easy Casino\n, and covers three blocks on the west side of Federal Highway between Northeast Sixth Street and Atlantic Shores Boulevard.",

        "content": "Grand Prairie is pulling thousands of acres into its city limits to make way for one of North Texas\u2019 largest new communities.\nThe city council this month approved annexing about 900 acres into Goodland, a 5,000-acre master-planned project from Dallas-based Provident Realty Advisors. Located south of Mansfield near the U.S. 287 and 360 Tollway, the development is envisioned as a small city of its own, with homes, retail, civic amenities and even a water tower branded with its name. Goodland already counts more than 700 homes, with 280 more underway by David Weekley Homes and Highland Homes. At full buildout, the city projects the community will house 50,000 people and generate $5 billion in taxable value, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nProvident\u2019s plans for the annexed acreage include higher-density residential, regional parks, trails, a church, an event venue and a coffee shop. The firm is also planning a 50-acre town center with civic buildings and a walkable urban core, expandable if demand warrants. City services from Grand Prairie such as police, fire, water and sewer will now extend to the new land.\nRylan Yowell, managing director for Provident, said the annexation vote was key to the developer\u2019s partnership with the city. It\u2019s part of a phased agreement with the city to absorb all 5,000 acres. The vote on the 900 acres comes after the City Council annexed 1,500 acres of Goodland in\nDecember\n, and follows a\npattern\nby the municipality of supporting and annexing master-planned communities within its extra-territorial jurisdiction. Grand Prairie committed up to $45 million for new roads, including the nearly-finished Goodland Parkway, a 6-mile arterial linking Highways 360 and 287 that\u2019s expected to open by year\u2019s end.\n\nThe council also approved zoning changes to allow mixed-use and medium-density housing. The vote drew some opposition, mostly from residents worried about property taxes, but passed unanimously.\nProvident is also planning a 25-mile trail network and restoring 1,600 acres of floodplain and creek corridors. Earlier this year it broke ground on The Retreat, a $14 million amenity center with a clubhouse, pool, playground and fishing ponds, set to open in 2026.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The Milestone Group bought a 206-unit apartment complex near Boynton Beach for $46.4 million, marking an uptick in South Florida multifamily investment sales.\nDallas-based Milestone bought the Casa Brera at Toscana Isles at 4725 Via Bari in unincorporated Palm Beach County from Ramsey, New Jersey-based Raia Capital Management, according to records and real estate database Vizzda. The deal breaks down to $225,000 per unit.\nHampton Beebe and Avery Klann of Newmark represented the seller.\nThe buyer assumed the seller\u2019s $27.4 million Fannie Mae loan on the property and took out an additional $7.7 million Fannie Mae loan, Vizzda records show. Wells Fargo originated both loans.\nGenerally, buyers take over sellers\u2019 existing loans on properties because the debt has better terms than what the buyer can secure for new financing. The loan Milestone assumed from Raia Capital has an interest rate of 3.93 percent. The current rate is over 5 percent.\nAgency loans also tend to have better terms than bank financing, experts have said.\nThe purchase price is a roughly 20 percent discount from replacement cost in the \u201csupply-constrained\u201d submarket, David Giles, vice president of acquisitions at Milestone, said in the firm\u2019s news release about the deal.\nCompleted in 2013, Casa Brera comprises seven, three-story apartment buildings and a pair of one-story clubhouse buildings on a 12.2-acre site, per Vizzda. Raia Capital paid\n$44.4 million\nfor the complex in 2018, records show.\n\nCasa Brera offers one-bedroom to three-bedroom units, with monthly rents ranging from $1,456 to $2,610, according to its website.\nRaia Capital is an investment manager and developer with a portfolio of 3,000 apartments in Florida, Tennessee, Alabama, South Carolina and Missouri, its website shows. Founded by members of the Raia family, it\u2019s led by Samuel A. and Lawrence C. Raia.\nLed by Jeffrey L. Goldberg and Robert P. Landin, Milestone is a multifamily investor that\u2019s made more than $9 billion in investments since it was founded in 2003, according to its website. Its portfolio consists of more than 80,000 units.\nMilestone has been ramping up its South Florida deals in recent years. In 2021, it paid\n$107 million\nfor the 505-unit Emerald Palms apartment complex at 12325 Southwest 151st Street in unincorporated Miami-Dade County, near Zoo Miami. Last year, Milestone bought the 488-unit Axis Delray Beach apartment complex at 1495 Spring Harbor Drive in Delray Beach for\n$111.6 million\n.\nRecords show Milestone still owns both complexes.\nSome South Florida\nmultifamily\ninvestment sales have closed in recent months, despite elevated interest rates, slower demand and lease-ups, and flat \u2013\u2013 and even declining \u2013\u2013 rent growth. Buyers still closing on apartments largely are avoiding higher rates by using all cash or relying on loans from agencies and insurance firms. Some are assuming sellers\u2019 existing debt and others are finding other workarounds.\nThis month, Favo Capital bought the 22-story, 277-unit 1818 Park tower at 1818 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood for\n$190 million\nthrough a deal of all stock and an assumption of liabilities.\nAlso in August, Property Reserve \u2013\u2013 which invests The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\u2019 reserve funds into commercial real estate \u2013\u2013 paid\n$152.5 million\nfor the 384-unit Del Ola apartment complex at 7801 North Federal Highway in Boca Raton. Property Reserve recorded no loan for the deal.\n",

With hundreds of renters vying for just a handful of units, applicants spend hundreds of dollars only to walk away empty-handed.\nThe issue is landing squarely in the city\u2019s heated mayoral race. Hudson County Commissioner Bill O\u2019Dea, one of several candidates, pledged to ban such charges if elected. He told Gothamist he would issue an executive order blocking developers who receive city subsidies from collecting application fees and push for a broader ordinance.\nO\u2019Dea also floated creating a centralized database and standard application process, a move that would make the system more efficient.\nCouncilmember James Solomon backed the idea of banning the application fees.\n\nLandlords defended the fees, arguing they cover costs like credit and background checks. Wendy Paul of the Jersey City Apartment Owners Association told Gothamist her group is open to discussing fee waivers but warned owners need to recover expenses.\nCritics, however, note that multiplied across large applicant pools, the charges add up to a lucrative side stream for property managers.\nThe fight comes as New Jersey faces a statewide shortfall of more than 200,000 affordable units. In Jersey City, where more than 70 percent of residents rent, the pressure is acute. The city\u2019s median rent for a one-bedroom is $2,820, the fourth-highest in the country, according to Zumper.\nBanning application fees on affordable rentals wouldn\u2019t be the only significant change Jersey City landlords have encountered. A few months ago, the City Council\nvoted unanimously\nto ban apartment owners from using products like those from RealPage and Yardi Systems to suggest rents.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Pat Ryan, the insurance titan behind Aon and Ryan Specialty Group, joined the growing list of sellers offloading condos in the Bloomingdale\u2019s building for prices ripped from the 1990s.\nRyan and his wife, Shirley \u2014 namesake of the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab research hospital \u2014 sold their three-bedroom unit on the 62nd floor of the North Michigan Avenue tower for $1.75 million this month, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. That\u2019s a 60 percent haircut from the $4.4 million they paid in 2018. The condo traded for less than it did in 1994, when it sold for about $1.85 million, which would be about $4 million today, adjusted for inflation. The home\u2019s square-footage wasn\u2019t reported.\nIt\u2019s not the first time the billionaire couple has taken a bath in the building. Last December, they sold a unit on the same floor for $1.3 million \u2014 well below the $1.9 million they paid in 1989. The fire-sale pricing underscores a broader trend in the 900 North Michigan Avenue tower, where several recent deals have closed at or below their \u201990s numbers.\nAgents say many longtime owners aren\u2019t investing in updates that could boost resale value. Pam Miles of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices told the outlet that some residents, many of whom split time between multiple homes, are reluctant to endure the hassles of rehabbing, from material deliveries to elevator scheduling. Listing photos of the Ryans\u2019 condo suggested it hadn\u2019t been renovated in years.\n\nFor Ryan \u2014 whose net worth Forbes pegs at nearly $12 billion \u2014 the loss is a rounding error. The 87-year-old mogul built his fortune by founding Ryan Insurance in 1964, growing it into Aon, and later launching Ryan Specialty, now a $10 billion firm. He\u2019s also Northwestern University\u2019s biggest benefactor, funding the school\u2019s $860 million Ryan Field in Evanston.\nBut for Chicago\u2019s\nluxury condo market\n, the Ryans\u2019 sales reinforce an uncomfortable reality: marquee addresses aren\u2019t immune to depreciation, especially when units don\u2019t keep pace with buyers\u2019 expectations.\nRecent sales\nrecorded during the last few days showed losses in value in the millions, such as a three-bedroom condo in the Bloomingdale\u2019s tower that sold for $2.62 million. In 2009, the sellers of the property paid $5 million for it, or nearly twice the recent sale price.\nIn a city where trophy towers once promised\nbulletproof appreciation\n, the Bloomingdale\u2019s building is proving that even billionaire sellers can\u2019t rewrite market math.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Has Houston\u2019s office market bottomed out with the sale of 801 Travis Street?\nThe beleaguered 222,000-square-foot office building traded after nearly a decade on the CMBS loan watchlist. Court records show the sale was approved in June for $12.1 million, or $54 per square foot.\nThe buyer is Rashmi Teja, an entity affiliated with Ramesh Gunda, the CEO of engineering company Gunda Corporation. Gunda did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.\nThe seller is an affiliate of Dallas-based Lincoln Property Company.\nJLL has been hocking the 21-story building that was built in 1981 and renovated in 2014 as a value-add investment opportunity since November.\nAt the time of the listing, it was 43 percent occupied. It had been half-filled for years, the Houston Business Journal\nreported\n, but occupancy dipped further when another major tenant, Maryland-based KCI Technologies, left in October. It had occupied 15,000 square feet.\n\nThe $30 million CMBS loan on the property, which was issued in 2013, had a balance of $24 million in July 2024. Around the same time, the building was valued at $19.9 million \u2014 half its 2013 value of $43 million.\nThe property\u2019s loan has shown up on servicer watchlists since 2016, the\nreport\nsaid. A receiver was appointed in February 2024 after the loan matured, court records show.\nLincoln Property Company bought 801 Travis in 2015 on behalf of a pension fund client from Atlanta-based Goddard Investment Group.\nThe building\u2019s distress saga illustrates the broader issues in Houston\u2019s office market, which is saddled with mostly vacant older office buildings that have become obsolete.\nAt the end of the first quarter, vacancy at properties built in the last 15 years averaged 14.9 percent, compared to 27.5 percent in properties constructed before 2009, according to Partners Real Estate.\nDespite the challenges faced by 801 Travis, the submarket it\u2019s located in, Houston\u2019s CBD, is performing well. It was pulling the highest asking rents of any submarket in the city, at about $35 per square foot.\n",

They were arrested in Miami in December on sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking charges.

Tisch and her husband, venture capitalist Dan Levine, first listed the prewar four-bedroom last March for $13 million, ultimately shaving about 20 percent off the ask to get it done.\nThe deal breaks down to $2,625 per square foot. The couple bought the unit in 2011 for $8 million from Tisch\u2019s parents, James and Merryl, who helm and represent the family behind Loews Corp.\nThe buyer is Jonathan Berger, co-founder and chief executive officer of TP Birch Grove, a Hudson Yards-based investment arm of Dan Loeb\u2019s hedge fund Third Point, which manages about $12 billion. Berger paid cash, records show.\nThe duplex comes with Central Park views, a formal dining room, a gas fireplace and five and a half baths. But even for pedigreed co-ops in prime UES locations, aspirational pricing has met reality in the past year. Deep-pocketed buyers are still active, but willing to wait out sellers clinging to peak-era numbers.\n\nTisch, 43, has spent her career in city government, moving from Sanitation commissioner under Mayor Eric Adams to NYPD commissioner last year, where she oversees 36,000 officers. Her tenure has already sparked headlines, including the launch of \u201cQ Teams\u201d targeting quality-of-life offenses, a throwback to broken-windows policing that critics warn could disproportionately impact minority communities.\nWhere she and Levine are headed next isn\u2019t clear. Corcoran\u2019s Deborah Grubman, David Adler and Paul Albano had the listing.\nThe co-op isn\u2019t far from Victor Sigoura\u2019s 109 East 79th Street, which recently scored a\ncontract\nfor a 16th-floor condo asking just under $35 million.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The closing had been expected last month.\nThe deal still would have left Brookfield\u2019s lenders underwater on the $275 million commercial mortgage-backed securities debt connected to the 41-story office tower at 725 South Figueroa Street. It was\nplaced\nin receivership two years ago after Brookfield defaulted on the debt.\nThe 900,000-square-foot office property is valued at $150 million, after an appraisal last year, compared to $446 million four years ago when the debt was issued, Morningstar data shows.\nCarolwood and Eastdil Secured, who was marketing the property, declined to comment. Brookfield and the receiver did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe latest status update from the court-appointed receiver read: \u201cEastdil is now engaged and actively marketing the property for a receiver\u2019s sale. Plaintiff is continuing to evaluate all of its options, including but not limited to foreclosure.\u201d\nThe office tower\u2019s anchor tenant for which it is named after, Ernst &amp; Young has occupied the property since 1999. The company\u2019s lease encompasses 128,000 square feet, about 14 percent of the total space.\nBrookfield has faced significant distress in Los Angeles, particularly downtown, where it has offloaded properties for less than the debt tied to them.

        "content": "Chicago\u2019s Navy Pier is dangling one of the city\u2019s most high-profile redevelopment opportunities, asking developers to reimagine its eastern end in a move that could redefine the state\u2019s most visited tourist destination.\nNavy Pier Inc., the nonprofit that operates the 109-year-old landmark, issued a request for concepts last month seeking bold ideas to \u201crevitalize\u201d the pier\u2019s east end and potentially take on operations of its facilities, the Chicago Sun-Times\nreported\n. The call precedes a formal request for proposals, which will be issued once preliminary visions are submitted.\nThe scope is sweeping. Depending on which scenario a developer pursues, projects could include Festival Hall and adjoining back-of-house spaces, or extend further to cover the Terminal and Shelter buildings, outdoor beer gardens, and 60,000 square feet of the Aon Grand Ballroom. Most of those structures date to the pier\u2019s 1915 origins, while Festival Hall was added during its 1990s redevelopment.\nMore than $450 million of public and private investments have been injected into other parts of the pier in the past dozen years, including a replacement of the ferris wheel, the 223-room\nSable Hotel\nand other south dock projects.\n\nThe nonprofit pitched the opportunity as a \u201cdefining chapter\u201d for the pier, which drew more than 8.5 million\nvisitors\nlast year. The east end alone accounted for $16.5 million in expenses out of $65.9 million in total operating costs, with annual revenues reaching $70.9 million. Developers have until Nov. 3 to submit concepts, with questions allowed before final bids.\nThe effort follows the opening of the privately funded\nNavy Pier Marina\nthis summer, which had been delayed for years over security concerns from City Hall.\nThe 170,000-square-foot Festival Hall has long been a key venue for conventions and exhibitions. Redevelopment could cement the pier\u2019s status as a global attraction and a revenue engine.\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "A Signature Development affiliate is in default for a loan tied to an apartment building in Oakland.\nThe affiliate was served a notice of default for the debt behind Mason at Hive, a 105-unit building at 2350 Valley Street in Uptown Oakland, the San Francisco Business Times\nreported\n. The investor-owned entity managed by Signature defaulted on a $39.8 million loan originated in 2016 and modified in 2020. It still owes $1 million on the loan.\nForeclosure could be imminent as a result of the default. Building owners have 90 days from the notice of default to repay.\nThe building was developed in 2015 as part of a larger project, The Hive, which turned a seven-building former car dealership in Uptown Oakland into offices, retail and restaurants. When the apartments opened for rent, residents quickly moved in, the outlet reported. Its assessed value as of last month is about $24 million, or $228,600 per unit.\nSignature Development is working with the lender and investor group to reach a solution, company founder Mike Ghielmetti told the outlet, though he noted \u201cOakland has experienced a slow and anemic recovery from the effects of the pandemic\u201d and, as a result, the developer is \u201csubject to market forces.\u201d\nSignature initially was entitled for 367 units of housing at the site with plans to build a high-rise, but the Oakland-based firm changed course after the 2008 recession. It instead opted to pursue a mixed-use development.\n\nThe distress could add to a string of\nmultifamily properties in Oakland\ngoing back to lenders or selling in a short sale. In April, Signature turned over the Orion Apartments at Brooklyn Basin to its lender via deed in lieu of foreclosure after racking up $138 million in debt and interest on the property.\nLast December,\nThree Steps Properties\nbought the 254-unit building at 447 17th Street for $99 million, representing a 53 percent drop from its assessed value. Quarterra, a subsidiary of the Lennar Corporation, owned that property and took out a $97 million loan in 2020.\nThe following month, The Martin Group bought\n1889 Harrison Street\nin downtown Oakland for $61 million, or about half of its assessed value.\nQuarterra\nalso took out a $70 million loan on the property in 2021.\nIn June, Oakland-based developer oWow gave back 1919 Market Street in West Oakland to its lender via deed in lieu of foreclosure. At the time, there was $50 million in debt on the 102-unit property, dwarfing the building\u2019s $40 million assessed value.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "A Taiwanese manufacturing powerhouse partnering with Nvidia is planting a flag in Fort Worth, in a move likely to spur real estate activity in the area.\nWistron confirmed this week that its U.S. subsidiary, Wistron InfoComm USA, will spend $760 million redeveloping twin factories that will assemble next-generation supercomputers, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n. The facilities will span more than 1 million square feet in north Fort Worth.\nThe plants, expected to open early next year, will employ 888 people and serve as a key hub in Nvidia\u2019s $500 billion effort to build out artificial intelligence infrastructure worldwide. Foxconn and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company are also part of the initiative.\nWistron snapped up two properties this summer in the 27,000-acre master-planned development AllianceTexas. It bought a 324,600-square-foot building at 15200 Heritage Parkway from Trammell Crow Company, which will serve as its primary site with a $580 million investment, and the 767,000-square-foot Westport 14 at 14601 Mobility Way, from Hillwood, where it will spend another $181 million.\nCity and county officials signed off on tax breaks to secure the deal, which quietly came together over recent months.\nJackie Lai, Wistron\u2019s senior vice president of global manufacturing, told the outlet that\nFort Worth\nwon out for its workforce talent and its logistics and industrial infrastructure.\n\nAllianceTexas developer and Hillwood chairman Ross Perot Jr. framed the deal as a watershed for reshoring.\nFor North Texas, the investment marks a full-circle moment. Intel once planned a $2 billion chip plant in the same corridor in the 1990s, before scrapping the project. This time, the momentum is real: Wistron\u2019s move follows activity from MP Materials, which is working on a $500 million rare earth magnet factory nearby in partnership with Apple.\nWistron, one of the world\u2019s largest contract manufacturers, spun off from Acer in 2001 and now produces hardware for some of the biggest names in tech. Its Fort Worth commitment signals the scale of Nvidia\u2019s AI push and the\nregion\u2019s growing role\nin the global supply chain.\nMeanwhile, about 120 miles west of Fort Worth, Denver-based\nVantage Data Centers\nhas teed up a $25 billion tech campus near Abilene.\nThe company is building a 1.4-gigawatt facility in Shackelford County, comprising a 10-building, 1,200-acre data center campus. The first building of the project is expected to be completed late next year. The buildings will span 3.7 million square feet and should create 250 jobs.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Authorities responded to a suspected fire at the former Pfizer headquarters in Manhattan, the site of a highly anticipated Nathan Berman and David Werner residential conversion.\nWork stopped at the massive construction site at 235 East 42nd Street, resulting in hundreds of construction workers milling on the sidewalk while the fire department investigated the situation, according to eyewitness accounts and videos viewed by\nThe Real Deal\n. Work halted for about 20 minutes, according to a member of the construction crew.\nAccording to Berman\u2019s Metro Loft, no fire actually occurred, but the New York Fire Department was called due to smoke coming from the construction site. No damage has been reported, and work resumed after a brief NYFD investigation.\nThe Midtown site is home to the largest office-to-resi conversion in New York City. Nathan Berman\u2019s Metro Loft\nreached a deal\nin March 2024 to convert the former Pfizer headquarters into approximately 1,500 rental units.\n\nBerman purchased a minority stake in the site from David Werner, who had bought the interests in the property five years earlier when Pfizer relocated to Tishman Speyer\u2019s Spiral.\nWerner owns the leasehold of the larger of the two buildings, the 33-story 235 East 42nd Street, after purchasing it for $407 million. He bought the smaller 10-story 219 East 42nd Street in partnership with life sciences developer Alexandria Real Estate Equities for $142 million before buying out the real estate investment trust.\nThe developers have gone through several rounds of financing for the massive undertaking. In May, the pair secured a $700 million construction loan from Madison Realty Capital, a record amount for a residential conversion project in New York.\nNorthwind Group last summer provided a $75 million loan to the joint venture for the property at 219 East 42nd Street, which is also slated for redevelopment. In January, the firm supplied another\n$135 million\nfor the site.\nConstruction is expected to wrap the last quarter of 2027. The combined property, which will host a mix of luxury rentals and affordable housing through the 467m tax abatement program, will include more than 100,000 square feet of amenities and 30,000 square feet of retail space.\n",

        "content": "Boca Raton\u2019s Planning &amp; Zoning Board voted in favor of developers James and Marta Batmasian\u2019s proposal to build a mixed-use hotel near the Mizner Park shopping and entertainment district.\nDespite pleas from downtown area condo residents, the board voted 5 to 1 on Thursday to recommend parking space waivers and other zoning changes that will enable the Batmasians to build Mizner Plaza, a twin 12-story hotel project with 242 rooms, 18,840 square feet of retail and 16,000 square feet of restaurant space at 132 and 170 Northeast Second Street.\nThe\nproject\nwould replace a U.S. Post Office branch and a retail plaza.\nThe board also voted 5 to 1 to recommend that the city transfer its 0.3-acre parking lot at 190 Northeast Second Street to the Batmasians so they can build underground parking for the project.\nBoard member Dorothy MacDiarmid was the lone dissenter for both measures, which will ultimately be decided by Boca Raton\u2019s mayor and city council members at a future meeting.\nThe parking waiver will allow the Batmasians to build just 372 spaces at the 1.9-acre site instead of the 569 spaces currently required, the developers\u2019 land use attorney, Ele Zachariades said. The developers also want to build two-levels of underground parking below what is now a city-owned, 17-space parking lot.\nThe waiver will allow the developer to incorporate a stepped-style crafted by Boca Raton-architecture firm HdA that would place the retail, restaurant spaces and amenities on the first, second, fourth and 12th floors of the hotel, Zachariades said.\nThe hotel rooms would be between 380 and 1,100 square feet in size, according to a memo.\nThe Batmasians offered to replace the lot\u2019s 17 parking spaces and turn the above ground area into a mini public park. But the majority of the planning and zoning board sided with city staffers\u2019 recommendation that the developers pay the city for the land\u2019s appraised $2.4 million value with nearly $900,000 in cash and the rest in public improvements and maintenance credits related to the spaces and future park.\nWithout the parking waiver and city land, the developers would pursue a design that would end up blocking most condo dwellers\u2019 views and consist almost entirely of hotel rooms, Zachariades said.\n\nBut residents at the neighboring\nTower 155\n, a complex finished in 2020 that is up to 150 feet tall, asked the board to vote no on the project or delay it for further analysis.\nJeff Costello, a planning consultant retained by Tower 155\u2019s condo association, said there will be more than 2,400 daily new trips in the area once the hotel is built, much of it going through a 20-foot alleyway between Tower 155 and the future development.\nRichard De Witt, an attorney representing the same asociation, argued that the project should be delayed because it did not go through proper procedures and that the sale of the parking lot should go out to bid.\nDe Witt also pointed out that a previous appraisal for the land done by the city\u2019s consultant, Walter Duke &amp; Associates, put the value of the land at $3.3 million.\n\u201cOnce the developers saw that they balked at the price and demanded a new appraisal,\u201d De Witt told the board, adding that the Batmasians want \u201cto pay zero\u201d for the land.\nZachariades countered that the first appraisal included public properties that were not part of her clients\u2019 undergrounding plans.\nMost board members, though, said the project would help revitalize the Mizner Park district and Boca Raton\u2019s downtown area.\n\u201cI do think it is a beautiful building. Mizner needs something. Mizner has a lot of problems,\u201d board member Timothy Dornblaser said.\nThis is the second hotel plan the Batmasians have proposed near Mizner Park.\nAn earlier proposal\n, made in the summer of 2023, would have consisted of two 11-story buildings with 266 hotel rooms and 32,400 square feet of retail and restaurants.The Batmasians founded Investments Limited in the early 1980s and have become one of the biggest real estate developers in the Boca Raton area. James Batmasian served eight months in prison after pleading guilty for evading $250,000 in payroll taxes in 2008. But he was pardoned by President Donald Trump in\nDecember 2020\n.\n",

        "content": "Malibu has gotten its first rebuild permit after January\u2019s deadly wildfires.\nYolanda Bundy, the city\u2019s community development director, announced the securing of the permit last week, The Malibu Times\nreported\n.\nAccording to Bundy\u2019s update on the recovery process, 480 residential properties have been cleared by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers while 185 property owners cleared debris privately.\nRebuilding fee waivers are now available for those affected not just by the Palisades fire, but the previous two fires impacting Malibu residents: the Broad fire of last November and the Franklin fire the following month. The residence must be a single-family home or duplex that was a person\u2019s primary residence at the time of the fire.\n\u201cCommercial properties unfortunately are not eligible,\u201d Bundy said, per the Malibu Times.\nThe deadline to apply for waivers is June 30, 2028, with the waivers only applying to permits obtained before the close of 2030.\n\nThe easiest way to secure a building permit is to apply for a \u201clike-for-like\u201d or \u201clike-for-like-plus-10-percent\u201d rebuild, according to Tyler Eaton, principal planner for the City of Malibu. This exempts homeowners from coastal and environmental reviews.\nGov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s recent\nrollback of key California Environmental Quality Act\nprovisions that will exempt developments from environmental reviews is expected to clear the way for faster building across the state, including those affected by the Palisades and Eaton fires.\nLos Angeles County has been issuing rebuilding permits in the Pacific Palisades and Altadena, though the awarding of permits has been slow over the past seven months, to say the least.\nSo far, 238 rebuild permits have been issued across the Palisades and Eaton burn zones, including 221 in the Eaton burn zone and 17 in the Palisades burn zone, according to the county\u2019s\npermitting progress dashboard\n.\nThe City of Malibu\u2019s planning department, meanwhile, has approved 45 rebuilding applications within its city limits, according to its own\npermit tracker\n. Only one, however, has had its building plan approved thus far.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

California won\u2019t get any Bed Bath &amp; Beyond storefronts as the company prepares to relaunch some brick-and-mortar operations.\n\u201cThis decision isn\u2019t about politics; it\u2019s about reality,\u201d Lemonis said. \u201cCalifornia has created one of the most overregulated, expensive, and risky environments for businesses in America. It\u2019s a system that makes it harder to employ people, harder to keep doors open, and harder to deliver value to customers.\u201d\nCompanies that operate in the Golden State face \u201chigher taxes, higher fees, higher wages that many businesses simply cannot sustain, and endless regulations that strangle growth,\u201d he said.\n\nBed Bath &amp; Beyond filed for\nbankruptcy\nin 2023 and closed all 360 of its stores from coast to coast. In early 2022, a year before the troubled retailer filed for bankruptcy, there were 87 Bed Bath &amp; Beyond locations in California, per Statista.\nThe company is in the midst of a rebirth as Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Home. The first location opened in Nashville earlier this month. About 75 former Kirkland\u2019s Home locations across the country are expected to turn into Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Home stores by next year.\nCustomers in California will still have access to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond\u2019s inventory via the company\u2019s website. In response to Lemonis\u2019 statement, Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s office brushed off the executive\u2019s rebuff of the state.\n\u201cAfter their bankruptcy and closure of every store, like most Americans, we thought Bed Bath &amp; Beyond no longer existed,\u201d the governor\u2019s office wrote on social media. \u201cWe wish them well in their efforts to become relevant again as they try to open a second store.\u201d\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "An East Austin landfill that closed decades ago has become the unlikely roadblock to one of the city\u2019s most ambitious mixed-use projects.\nGraham Development is suing Travis County after officials denied its plan to relocate an auto scrapyard to a 42-acre site at 9500 East U.S. Highway 290 \u2014 a former landfill that stopped accepting waste in 1982 but allegedly still leaks toxins into nearby soil and water, the Austin Business Journal\nreported\n.\nThe Austin-based firm needs the scrapyard, LKQ Auto Salvage, off its South Congress Avenue property in order to move forward with a planned 43-acre project that would deliver more than 1,200 apartments, 210,000 square feet of offices, and 136,000 square feet of retail. The development would be positioned next to where Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority is building a new\nOrange Line\nrail route.\nThe problem: LKQ\u2019s lease at 7900\nSouth Congress Avenue\nruns until 2036. Without relocating it, Graham\u2019s transit-oriented project is stuck in limbo. The developer and the landfill\u2019s owner, Moo Moo Meadows, filed a lawsuit July 31 in federal court, arguing the county exceeded its authority when it blocked the scrapyard relocation and claiming the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality \u2014 not the county \u2014 should decide land use questions for closed landfills.\n\nThe suit also accused Travis County of decades of neglect, saying the landfill has been leaking hazardous leachate into the ground since the 1960s and still tests positive for unsafe levels of arsenic, barium and lead. Graham alleges the county is using the contamination as a \u201cbludgeon\u201d to stifle development.\nCounty officials pushed back, pointing to ongoing cooperation with TCEQ and past efforts to address the landfill. Travis County commissioners voted unanimously in August 2023 to deny the scrapyard move, citing risks to human health and environmental safety.\nThe stakes go beyond legal wrangling. The South Congress project could reshape a corridor already under heavy development pressure, bringing both density and affordable housing to a rapidly growing part of the city. But until the scrapyard has left the vision on ice.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "New Yorkers retreat to the Hudson Valley to escape the hustle and bustle of city life.\nThey find refuge in the quieter expanses in a two-hour range of Manhattan, where drool-worthy properties aren\u2019t glitzy high-rise condos, but quaint farmhouses, Victorian mansions and sprawling estates. Historically, the firms trading those properties were boutique mainstays that embrace the pace of small(er) town life.\nEnter Serhant.\nThe five-year-old brokerage\nset up shop\nin the region in October with a 10-person team poached from Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices\u2019 Hudson Valley franchise.\nThe then-four-year-old brokerage was relatively early\namong its New York City-born competitors\nin establishing a Hudson Valley presence. Corcoran launched Corcoran Country Living in 2020 and Compass earlier this year added the 14-agent Upstate Untapped Team.\nThe interest from brokerages has followed a rising tide in the Hudson Valley market. Home prices hit record highs last year, just as Serhant opened its doors, with the median sale price in every county in the region beating $300,000, the Times Union reported earlier this year.\nAlmost a year into the Garay-Michaud Team\u2019s tenure at the brokerage and it appears the team has embraced the firm\u2019s signature social media- and content-friendly stunts to sell homes.\nThis week, broker Jordan Vaccaro hosted roughly 60 brokers at a mountaintop estate in East Fishkill for a sunset soiree, complete with a DJ and private chef. An unusual addition to the broker open house \u2014 off-road ATV tours of the 120-acre property, on the market for just under $4 million. (Vaccaro had initially planned for a helicopter to sail over 401 Woodmount Road, known as the Cloud Walk Estate, but wind conditions kept the party grounded.)\nCruising between the estate\u2019s two homes, barn and three-car garage meant a trove of Instagram-worthy shots, and while taking an ATV around the streets of Manhattan likely won\u2019t happen any time soon, the footage posted on social media rivals the drone shots of Billionaires\u2019 Row towers that Serhant is famous for.\n\u201cJaws\u201d in the Hamptons\nA luxury residential broker who\u2019s a fixture in Manhattan\u2019s social scene said she was caught in a beachfront fray in East Hampton this week. Gail Bomze, a 75-year-old Compass agent who has brought eight-figure listings to the market, was accused of biting a seven-year-old in a dust-up at a community concert.\nAn\narrest report seen by Page Six\ndescribed an account from an event worker that a woman was seen \u201ckicking and punching kids\u201d to get hold of a t-shirt thrown as a giveaway at a beach concert in East Hampton last week. In the frenzy, a child told police, a woman \u201cgrabbed her right arm and bit,\u201d drawing blood.\nBomze, who was arrested Tuesday and charged with third-degree assault and endangering a child, has denied the allegations. In a statement to the outlet, her attorney said Bomze was instead \u201cknocked to the ground\u201d in the chaos of the t-shirt toss and reported the incident to organizers, who returned with an apology for the fray.\n\nNot so fast\u2026\nMayor Eric Adams\u2019 administration is back in the news this week after two of the New York City leader\u2019s associates\nwere indicted\non Thursday.\nProsecutors accused the mayor\u2019s former aide, Ingrid Lewis-Martin, of accepting bribes and other perks from real estate developers in exchange for helping them secure city contracts and expediting their projects.\nJesse Hamilton\n, who oversaw the city\u2019s office leasing portfolio, allegedly conspired with Lewis-Martin and heeded her directives to give certain developers preference.\nThe developers identified in the indictments are Tian Ji Li and Yechiel Landau. One of the indictments also alleges Lewis-Martin conspired with Anthony and Gina Argento, the owners of a production studio, to ditch the protected bike lanes included in the redevelopment plans for McGuinness Boulevard in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.\nLewis-Martin \u2014 who was already facing charges in a December indictment \u2014 allegedly accepted $75,000 worth of bribes over two years, including a speaking role in the TV show \u201cGodfather of Harlem.\u201d\nHamilton resigned from his post at the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, or DCAS, on Thursday following news of the indictment. Lewis-Martin resigned from the administration last year.\nAdams was previously facing federal charges of fraud and bribery, among others, though a federal judge dropped the case in April.\nNYC Deal of the Week\nThe priciest deal to land in public records this week was a condo at Extell Development\u2019s One57, which traded at a loss. Unit 51C at the Billionaires\u2019 Row tower sold for just under $15 million, or $4,300 per square foot \u2014 down from its 2015 purchase price of $19 million.\nThe discount is in line with other\nresales at the building\n, which has seen units trade for roughly 24 percent less than their sponsor sale price.\nThe four-bedroom, four-bathroom apartment has drifted on and off the market since 2018, when it was listed for $22 million, and last asked $18 million.\nBespoke had the listing.\n",

        "content": "Remember when real estate executives were dropping Andrew Cuomo and backing Eric Adams\u2019 re-election bid?\nThat now seems like\nages ago\n, and I\u2019m hearing from some in the industry that we shouldn\u2019t expect the level of spending that we saw in the lead up to the primary \u2014 on either candidate. One source noted that industry insiders were shocked by Cuomo\u2019s loss in the primary and responded by throwing their support behind Adams. Some may now step back, the source said.\nThis week, I asked readers of this newsletter \u2014\u00a0specifically those who had decided after the primary to back Adams \u2014 if they had changed their mind given the mayor\u2019s place in the polls and the additional corruption\nallegations\nagainst those in his inner circle.\nI heard from two people who firmly feel the mayor\u2019s fate in the election shouldn\u2019t be swayed by the accusations against his former top aide and his former real estate chief. Nor the\npotato chip incident\nwith former aide Winnie Greco. They also remained supportive of the mayor, even after he was personally indicted (charges that were dismissed this year).\n\u201cI am sticking with re-electing Mayor Adams because I think he did a pretty good job considering that he had so little support from the City Council and had an impossible job fixing all the mistakes made by [Bill] de Blasio\u2019s disastrous mayoralty,\u201d attorney Stuart Saft said in an email.\nFor his part, the mayor was defiant at a press conference on Friday, noting that some reporters had asked his staff if he was going to announce his exit from the race. He said he couldn\u2019t leave the city to the other candidates in the race.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come too far to go backwards,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThat is not going to happen.\u201d\nOthers in the industry appear to be watching and waiting. For example, RXR\u2019s Scott Rechler, who indicated last month he was open to supporting Adams, has not formally decided who to support, per a rep. He previously donated $250,000 to Fix the City, a super PAC tied to Cuomo.\nToday was the deadline for mayoral campaigns to report their donation hauls between July 12 and August 18. As of early Friday evening, the filings for most of the campaigns were not on the Campaign Finance Board\u2019s website.\nI was able to start sorting through Mamdani\u2019s filings. He reported taking in more than $1 million during this period. The filings indicate that roughly $19,700 came from real estate-related donors (including those who identified as working in real estate, development, brokerage, property management, construction and architecture). That included a $2,100 contribution from Obaid Khan, chief financial officer at Tishman Realty.\nI\u2019m expecting to see donations pop up from fundraisers held for Adams last month (the results of an SL Green fundraiser didn\u2019t seem to be in the last set of filings). The race is fluid, and the donations made in July already seem somewhat stale, perhaps not reflective of where the industry stands today in the race.\n\nOf course, that won\u2019t stop us from writing about which real estate executive donated to each of the campaigns, so keep an eye out for that.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nMore mayoral candidates should want to sit down and talk to nerds. Specifically, this nerd here \u2014 me. With this in mind, I ask you: Will Zohran Mamdani\u2019s press people ever respond to me?

The changes were made over traffic safety concerns,\nper Next City\n.\nElsewhere in New York\u2026\n\u2014\u00a0The family of Julia Hyman, the 27-year-old Rudin associate killed in the Midtown mass shooting last month, has hired a lawyer to investigate her death, according to the\nNew York Post\n. A source told the paper the elevators should have been shut down as soon as the shooter entered with a semi-automatic rifle, which might have prevented him from getting past the lobby. The family is also looking into whether Rudin provided adequate security given the building\u2019s high-profile tenants.\n\u2014\u00a0The city issued a permit to self-driving taxi company Waymo for a pilot program,\nGothamist\nreports. The permit allows the company to test eight self-driving cars on city streets, provided a driver is present and no passengers are on board. \u2014\nQuinn Waller\nClosing Time\nResidential:\nThe top residential deal recorded Friday was\n$13.3 million\nfor a condominium unit at 443 Greenwich Street.

        "content": "It\u2019s time to start using the B-word in L.A. That is, it\u2019s a buyer\u2019s market.\nAfter months of hemming and hawing and getting mixed answers depending on if someone is speaking on or off the record, those who have no problem telling it like it is are coming around to what this is \u2014 with some market-specific caveats.\nThe shift was perhaps tiptoed into sometime in the first quarter. That\u2019s when Marcy Roth of Douglas Elliman\u2019s Eklund Gomes team, who compiles the group\u2019s weekly signed contracts report, suggested the possibility of a buyer\u2019s market \u201cin the near future.\u201d That\u2019s when the brokerage\u2019s data pointed to weekly growth of luxury listings, without comparable signed contracts to offset the inventory ramp. In the case of the week ended March 15, there were 23 homes that went into contract, while 97 listings were added.\nThe most recent Eklund Gomes report for the week ended Aug. 17 had 20 signed contracts, while 76 homes were added to the market.\n\u201cThe word I would use is challenging because the market is shifting, but not completely,\u201d said Christie\u2019s International Real Estate Southern California COO Nina Zokhrabyan. \u201cYes, it is a buyer\u2019s market, but interest rates are high.\u201d\nThe part of the cycle L.A. real estate finds itself in is at a \u201cweird moment\u201d in time, she said.\nIn some cases, sellers still think their properties are worth what they originally asked, and buyers are seeing through the glossy photos and marketing speak.\nMuch like how the industry talked up good agenting following last year\u2019s NAR settlement over an antitrust lawsuit on commissions, this is where skill matters, some say.\n\u201cThe sellers and the buyers are now trying to figure out that price, that happy medium, and this is where the agents come in,\u201d Zokhrabyan said. \u201cIf you have really good agents on both ends, they\u2019ll be able to navigate and negotiate on the buyer\u2019s and seller\u2019s behalf to make the deal.\u201d\nULA throws off \u201cnormal\u201d cycle\nThere\u2019s more on Zokhrabyan\u2019s point about the market oddities.\nThat\u2019s so for a couple of reasons that are not cyclical. First off, there\u2019s the\nMeasure United to House LA\nfactor that has impacted the $5 million and above market.\nThe tiered tax for properties only in the city of Los Angeles kicks in with deals of $5.3 million getting assessed a 4 percent levy and 5.5 percent on those $10.6 million or more. The thresholds are adjusted annually by the city.\nThe \u201cmansion tax\u201d has been a wet blanket for deals since the November 2022 ballot measure went into effect in April 2023.\nThe Agency\u2019s Santiago Arana has a client, David Maman of David Maman Design, who in March sold 1050 Stradella Road in Bel-Air for $25 million and had to pay $2 million for\nULA\n. The end result was no profit on the sale.\nThe developer bought the property in 2018 for $4.8 million, built it anew into a seven-bedroom, 16-bathroom mansion and listed it in March 2024 for $33.8 million.\n\u201cULA, the fires, the economy\u2014all that has created uncertainty in the L.A. market,\u201d Arana said.\nThe fires factor\nThe question of insurance bubbles up to the surface when looking at post-fire recovery and dealmaking.\nAltadena, Pasadena, Pacific Palisades and Malibu are all coming back from January\u2019s Palisades and Eaton fires. The blazes razed whole neighborhoods and communities, but it also added to jitters around the state\u2019s existing insurance crisis.\nInsurance\n, which one needs for a mortgage, is hard to come by or quite pricey.\n\u201cInsurance has quietly become one of the biggest deal killers in California real estate,\u201d said\u00a0 Parker Beatty, Compass regional vice president of Southern California and Hawaii.\u00a0 \u201cPost-fires, it\u2019s now one of the first questions a buyer asks, and the rising cost of ownership can spook people. With traditional insurance pulling back, many homeowners are being pushed into the state\u2019s\nFAIR Plan\n. Enrollments nearly doubled this year, highlighting both the depth of the problem and the scramble for solutions.\u201d\n\nThose in real estate can usually find the bright side, and Parker said there are opportunities to be had in the challenges: \u201cThose willing to navigate it are finding openings that others overlook,\u201d he said.\nMowbrays\u2019 $65M Moves in Malibu\nBrothers\nNick and Mat Mowbray\nfound success in toys, but recent real estate acquisitions in Malibu could place them at the forefront of the city\u2019s fire rebuilding process.\nThe Mowbrays are behind the mysterious buys of nine plots of land on Malibu\u2019s La Costa and Carbon beaches after the fires, spending $65 million on the real estate. The transactions were first reported by\nRealtor.com\n, and\nKevin Shelburn\nof Mar Vista-based Shelburn Realty Group sleuthed out the buyers\u2019 identity.\nIt\u2019s what the Mowbrays plan to do with the land that\u2019s now most interesting. The company did not return requests for comment on the purchases this past week, but one wonders if the oceanfront lots will be case studies for the Mowbrays\u2019 Zuru Tech pre-fabricated housing subsidiary. That\u2019s the software platform that promises the ability to design a custom home or commercial property online, with the components built in a factory and then delivered to the site.\nLast year, Nick Mowbray told\nBloomberg\nthe business is expected to \u201cdwarf everything we\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\nPerhaps Malibu will have a front-row seat to that.\nWhat buyer\u2019s market? $110M listing hits Santa Monica\nBranden and Rayni Williams are testing the theory of the ultra-wealthy bubble that can skirt broader market trends.\nThe Beverly Hills Estates co-founders placed a\n$110 million listing\non the market that is Santa Monica\u2019s priciest home for sale and one of eight in Los Angeles County in the nine-figure club.\nFor as much as agents talk up \u201cunique\u201d properties selling, 859 Woodacres Road really fits that profile. The 12,000-square-foot residence, asking $9,167 per square foot, sits at the Riviera Country Club\u2019s 7th hole and was designed by the late Howard Backen. The architect was known for his residential and winery work.\nThe asking price is about a 168 percent jump from the last known trade, which occurred off market in 2017. That\u2019s when the property sold for $41.1 million. At the time, the closing was Santa Monica\u2019s priciest-ever deal.\nChunk of OC history up for sale\nOrange County history buffs will appreciate this one.\nCompass\u2019 Annie Clougherty and Mike Johnson brought\n245 Crescent Bay Drive\nonto the market with an ask of just under $20 million. The estate of James and Martha Newkirk, the couple who bought the property in 1979, is selling the Laguna Beach home. The four-bedroom, five-bathroom property spans about 6,900 square feet and looks out onto the Pacific Ocean.\nThe home\u2019s only traded hands a few times since the 19th century.\nThat starts with the 1905 sale of what was once part of Irvine ranch to the McKnight family from the Irvine family. Irvine Ranch was made up of Spanish and Mexican land grants from 1864 and is the predecessor to the Irvine Company.\nThe McKnight family\u2019s L.C. McKnight was among a group of individuals who are credited with developing Laguna Cliffs, the first neighborhood in Laguna Beach.\nIn the 1920s, planes flown by Florence Lowe \u201cPancho\u201d Barnes passed by and landed close to the Crescent Bay Drive property. Barnes started the first stunt pilots union and broke Amelia Earhart\u2019s air speed record in 1930.\nNow, Chateau du Soleil\u2019s big claim is that it sits across from Los Angeles Times\u2019 billionaire owner Patrick Soon-Shiong\u2019s blufftop estate, which he bought for $45 million in 2016.\n",

        "content": "A development site in the West Loop that\u2019s zoned for up to 362 multifamily units is hitting the market during a historic supply drought.\nBut it\u2019s not just available space that developers are looking for. It\u2019s lower interest rates, lower construction costs, willing lenders and a more predictable property tax environment.\nIf the West Loop site sells, it will be because the appeal of the property has overcome all the other headwinds developers are facing in the city.\nLocated at 309 South Green Street, the listing consists of a parking lot and an industrial, loft-style office. With access to Fulton Market directly north and the Loop directly east, the site could benefit from demand for housing from young professionals. It is being marketed by Cushman &amp; Wakefield\u2019s Susan Tjanksen and Anna Lovell; the seller hasn\u2019t been identified.\nFewer than 300 units are slated for delivery this year, a historically low figure for the market, Integra Realty Resources found. It\u2019s been difficult to get apartment projects off the ground, but those that do get started will benefit from the city\u2019s strong rent growth.\n\nDowntown Chicago\u2019s luxury apartment rents rose 2.56 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarter, reaching $3.60 per square foot, Integra found. Rents in general are expected to grow 4 percent this year.\nJust north of the listing, Fulton Market is seeing some of the only major multifamily developments taking off.\nIn May, Cedar Street scored a discount on a Fulton Market property, setting the stage for a 300-unit apartment project. The Chicago-based firm paid $6.5 million for the former Leslie Hindman Auctioneers property at 1332 and 1338 West Lake Street.\nThe two connected buildings span roughly 36,000 square feet on just over half an acre at the northeast corner of Lake and Ada streets. Hindman listed it for sale in mid-2020 with an $11 million asking price.\nAn asking price isn\u2019t included in the 309 South Green listing but it will likely sell for a significant markup. The property has been held in a trust since the 1990s when it sold for just $375,000.",

That led to a lawsuit from\nlenders\nincluding JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank over unpaid debt.\nAt one point, San Francisco Centre was one of the best-performing malls on the West Coast, but it\u2019s largely become a ghost town. The shopping center is between 30 percent and 40 percent occupied, according to the\nSan Francisco Examiner\n, representing a steep drop from 96 percent in 2016. By that estimate, between 750,000 and 1 million square feet is vacant at the 1.5 million-square-foot mall.\nThe mall\u2019s court-appointed receiver Trident Pacific and real estate broker JLL are not involved in the auction process.\n\nRetailers and restaurants have been running for the doors over the past two years.\nIn 2023, Nordstrom\nclosed\nits flagship at the mall as part of its citywide exodus. It was followed by another anchor department store,\nBloomingdale\u2019s\n, earlier this year. Several other retailers have exited in recent months, including\nZara\n, Steve Madden, Kate Spade, Sunglass Hut, Oak + Fort and Razer electronics.\nIt\u2019s gotten harder to find a bite to eat at the barren shopping center. Restaurants and food court outposts have closed up shop, with the latest departees including Jamba Juice, Blondie\u2019s Pizza, Izzy &amp; Wooks sandwich shop, Mija Cochinita taco shop, Mai Savory Hot Dogs and a Fires of Brazil barbecue restaurant.\nFoot traffic has dropped off significantly as the mall empties out. Visitors to San Francisco Centre fell 63.3 percent between 2019 and 2024, according to the\nSan Francisco Business Times\n. It was just as bad from January to May of this year with foot traffic down 68 percent from the same period in 2019 and between 25 and 40 percent year-over-year.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "McKinney National Airport\u2019s commercial terminal is years off, but the project is already inspiring industrial development plans.\nCalifornia-based real estate firm CapRock Partners recently purchased 15 acres near the airport with plans for a business park that will cater to companies scouting suburban locations north of Dallas, the Dallas Business Journal\nreported\n.\nColliers\u2019 Randy Wood represented the seller. Wood will also manage leasing alongside Noah Dodge and Ben Wallace. Terms of the sale were not disclosed.\nMcKinney Air Business Park will consist of two buildings spanning 250,000 square feet. The development will feature rear-load buildings with high clear heights, LED lighting, dock-high doors, 130-foot truck courts and parking. Construction is expected to start in the first quarter of 2026 and be completed in the first quarter of 2027.\nThe airport started construction on the $79 million, 46,000-square-foot commercial terminal earlier this summer. It\u2019s supposed to be completed by 2031. The city said the project could accommodate up to 1 million passengers annually, providing an alternative to Dallas Fort Worth International and Love Field.\nThe airport expansion has inspired other industrial developments, too.\nHolley Development Company\nrecently collected 461 acres nearby for an industrial development.\n\nMcKinney Air Business Park will enjoy easy access to the future Spur 399, an eight-lane freeway currently under construction that would connect U.S. 75 with U.S. 380.\nThe airport expansion project and construction of Spur 399 come as Collin County, home to McKinney, is growing residents by the bushel: the county added around 46,700 residents between July 2023 and July 2024, according to the latest U.S. Census Bureau estimates.\nCaprock specializes in acquiring and developing industrial real estate in Texas, Colorado, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, California, Oregon and Washington. The company\u2019s Texas portfolio includes about 2 million square feet of industrial space in various stages of development.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "Carolwood\u2019s\ndeal\nto purchase EY Plaza for $130 million fell through. The office tower is coming back to market, a source familiar told\nThe Real Deal\n.\nServicer commentary indicated it was \u201cunable to negotiate acceptable documentation with the selected buyer,\u201d according to Morningstar. A month earlier, the special servicer said a buyer was selected, approvals were obtained, documentation had commenced and a closing was expected soon.\nThe sale to the Adam Rubin and Andrew Shanfeld-led firm still would have been less than the $275 million commercial mortgage-backed securities debt connected to the 41-story office building that was placed in receivership two years ago after Brookfield missed payments \u2014 and less than the 900,000-square-foot office property\u2019s latest value: $150 million. The office tower was once valued at $446 million four years ago.\nTo receive, or not to receive\nThe Rising Realty Partners-owned One California Plaza could be placed in\nreceivership\nafter defaulting on $300 million of CMBS debt, if the court agrees to the lender\u2019s request.\nOn behalf of the loan holders and through a special servicer, US Bank requested a receiver be appointed to take possession of the foreclosed, 1-million-square-foot office tower downtown and collect rents, according to a complaint filed in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County. The complaint notes that the plaintiff believes the borrower intends to consent to the appointment of a receiver.\nChristopher Rising\u2019s company and Colony Capital purchased the office tower at 300 South Grand Avenue for $465 million eight years ago. But the 42-story, Bunker Hill office property is now worth less than the debt connected to it and less than its purchase price. A recent appraisal put its value at about $121 million, compared to $459 million at loan issuance in 2017.\nPost-pandemic occupancy is down at the property to about 63 percent this year compared to 88 percent at underwriting.\n\u201cBorrower is in default under the loan documents and is depriving plaintiff of its interest in the rents, causing material, immediate and irreparable damage to plaintiff,\u201d the complaint reads. It later notes: \u201cunless a receiver is appointed, plaintiff will suffer great and irreparable damage.\u201d\nValue haircut\nRealty Bancorp\u2019s Los Angeles County office portfolio ran into some more\ntrouble\n. After the roughly $67 million in CMBS debt connected to the five-property portfolio landed in special servicing, the borrower became delinquent, with the offices worth less than half as much as it was at underwriting six years ago.\nThe 346,800-square-foot portfolio, located throughout Aguora Hills, Woodland Hills and Calabasas, was recently appraised at $47.8 million compared to $101.6 million in 2019.\nOne of the Aguora Hills properties was home to the Los Angeles Rams for nine years, but the team\u2019s billionaire owner, Stan Kroenke, moved the headquarters, part of a $10 billion development plan at Warner Center in Woodland Hills. Total occupancy declined to 72 percent at the end of June from 98 percent at underwriting six years ago \u2014 and the office buildings are not bringing in enough money to pay off the debt.\nThe latest servicer commentary notes that the borrower is requesting a short term forbearance, or a temporary suspension of loan payments for a set period, which the special servicer is reviewing.\n\nHundreds of million in bonds\nOne Beverly Hills could receive up to $550 million in bond\nfinancing\n, after the Beverly Hills City Council gave developers Cain International and OKO Group the greenlight to allot a Community Facilities District.\nThat means of the $550 million special taxes, $390 million would be used to fund public improvements and $160 million would be allocated for \u201cfuture city council to fund major repairs or enhancements to the public improvements decade from now without needing to revisit voter approvals,\u201d according to a presentation at the council meeting.\nThe 17.5-acre mixed-use development is set to include an Aman resort, two condominium towers and the renovation of Beverly Hilton hotel. Development is underway after the city council approved the plan in 2021, and the project is anticipated to be completed three years from now. Revenues would then be used to repay the bonds.\n\u201cThe CFDs really act like takeout financing,\u201d Cain\u2019s managing director said at the council meeting. \u201cIt is not a gift or a subsidy. There is no financial risk to the city, and there is no impact to the existing taxpayers outside of the CFD.\u201d\nMega-project moves\nMore development news out of the opulent Beverly Hills: the city planning commission\nvoted\nin favor of Saks Fifth Avenue parent company Saks Global\u2019s 3.7 acre mixed-use development. The approval came despite criticism during the public hearing, and with some amendments to logistics such as an area for pedestrians to walk and retail and restaurant space.\n\u201cAt the last meeting, there were questions about the retail and restaurant distribution. To clarify this issue and move the project forward, we\u2019re prepared to accept a limit of 15,088 square feet of restaurant use, as shown on the concept plan, exclusive of the hotel and private club,\u201d Douglas Adams, senior vice president of Saks\u2019 real estate development arm, said during the August meeting.\nThe plan calls for 76 apartments, a boutique hotel, a spa, a social club, 45,000 square feet of offices and 64,000 square feet of retail \u2014 and is designed by Marmol Radziner. It is expected to take more than four years to complete.\nHollywood refi\nHackman Capital Partners and Affinius Capital secured a three-year, $165 million\nfinancing\npackage for Raleigh Studios. The financing will be used to repay $135 million of existing debt.\nNetflix leases most of the 314,940-square-foot Hollywood film studio as a hub for some of its biggest-budget deals that include production companies owned by Former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and Shonda Rhimes \u2014 the woman who gave the world\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy\n. The streaming giant is about halfway through a 10-year lease.\nHackman, Affinius, and Raleigh Enterprises are all owners: Hackman holds a 36 percent stake, Affinius 34 percent and Raleigh Enterprises 30 percent, though the latter has owned the property since 1979.\n",

        "content": "As Mayor Brandon Johnson strives to reset his standing with voters and Chicago\u2019s real estate community, some more of the city\u2019s big landlords are working to reset theirs with lenders.\nJohnson is a little over halfway through his first term, but his\nreal estate report card\nis a mixed bag. Go inside his grades on real estate-related policies according to industry players and a deputy mayor, from an A for\neliminating parking minimums\nto an F for his\nfailed transfer tax hike\n.\nLenders keep piling up lawsuits in the office market. New York-based\nFeil Organization\nis staring down foreclosure on a 35,000-square-foot West Loop loft office on Madison Street, after occupancy fell below 50 percent. It\u2019s just the latest Chicago headache for Feil, which already\nsurrendered a River North property\nand is battling\nlitigation over its LaSalle Street tower\n.\n\nIn the multifamily market, student housing\nsyndicator Versity Investments has fallen behind on $83 million in loans\ntied to The Buckingham and Tailor Lofts, two student towers near Roosevelt and UIC, respectively.\nBut bigger deals are getting back to flowing. Stuart Handler\u2019s firm\nTLC dropped $100 million on a Vernon Hills apartment complex\nto mark the highest price in the suburbs so far this year. In Chicago, developer\nNoah Properties scored a $34 million exit for The Avondale\n, a 52-unit rental townhome complex on Belmont Avenue. The buyer is eyeing a rare rental-to-condo conversion, flipping the script on a decade of deconversions.\nDevelopment site prices remain down. In the Gold Coast, investor Don Wilson\u2019s real estate firm\nConvexity scooped up a property entitled for 304 apartments\nat 1120 North State Street for $39 million, more than a third below its 2019 sale price. The parcel was once slated for a 42-story tower, but may see a fresh plan under Convexity.\nThe\nmegaproject once set to transform the Chicago River\u2019s North Branch\nis splintering some more.\nSterling Bay has put the only finished Lincoln Yards building\non the market \u2014 a vacant 284,000-square-foot lab-and-office property at 1229 West Concord. Once envisioned as the anchor to a $6 billion neighborhood, it now overlooks empty land that\nnew developers, JDL and Kayne Anderson, move ahead\nhave rebranded portions of with new plans for over 3,000 apartments.",

        "content": "The Trump administration\u2019s sweeping deportations raised an alarm for apartment associations recently, amid reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers hitting landlords with subpoenas seeking information on tenants.\nThe National Apartment Association and the Apartment Association of Greater Dallas\nissued advisories\non the federal overreach, informing members of the difference between the immediate urgency of a warrant, and a subpoena, which doesn\u2019t have to be answered right away.\nEven though Dallas-Fort Worth is the market where ICE is most actively cracking down, there is little evidence of multifamily landlords being hit with ICE subpoenas. But that has been reported in Georgia and Massachusetts.\nTexas politicians who have spoken out against ICE raids in Texas, such as U.S. Representative Greg Casar, haven\u2019t yet weighed in on the situation.\nHere\u2019s more Texas real estate news from this week.\nAustin lost an influential real estate player with the death of brokerage executive and developer\nTodd Wallace\n. Wallace, who was president of JLL\u2019s Central Texas region and CEO of CSW Development, died late last month after a six-year battle with cancer. He was 53.\n\nAshford Hospitality Trust, led by Dallas investor Monty Bennett, failed to refinance a $580 million hotel portfolio, according to the loan\u2019s special servicer, as reported by Morningstar Credit. The firm said it received an\nextension until January\nand is waiting for interest rates to drop before refinancing. The portfolio, comprising 18 hotels across 13 states (with several in Texas), went into special servicing in June after a missed balloon payment.\nThere is optimism in Austin\u2019s multifamily market, despite the area\u2019s\noversupply\nof new apartments. Occupancy dropped to 85 percent and average rents are down 7.5 percent year-over-year, making financing and valuations more difficult. However, reduced construction starts and strong absorption suggest the market may rebound next year.\nAustin-based\nCapital Commercial Investments\nacquired Energy Crossing I in West Houston, after buying its twin, Energy Crossing II, last year. The buildings, purchased from Dallas-based Invesco Real Estate, span 560,000 square feet. Capital Commercial Investments, helmed by Doug Agarwal, has been targeting newer suburban office properties amid a market trend favoring modern buildings.\nThe most expensive home sold in Houston last month was a 1938 mansion at\n2110 River Oaks Boulevard\n, which was listed for $18.9 million, or $2,004 per square foot. The 1.6-acre estate includes a 9,400-square-foot main house and two additional dwellings, and was purchased by philanthropists Martha Long and Sean Wade.\nThe Dallas City Council unanimously rejected a proposal to ditch the city\u2019s\n\u201cpay-to-delay\u201d ordinance\n, which allows nearby property owners to postpone zoning cases for a $150 fee. The decision highlighted the divide between the council and Mayor Eric Johnson, who is pushing for streamlined development and zoning reforms.\n",

        "content": "Upwards of 20,000 apartment units in San Francisco\nare in limbo\nas projects face years of delays or fall by the wayside entirely.\nOnly 1,453 housing units were completed last year, representing less than a third of the more than 5,000 delivered in 2020. Last year, plans were filed for just 2,541 new homes. Meanwhile, the city is way behind on its state-mandated goal of permitting 82,000 units by 2031 as part of its Housing Element.\nResidential developments like\nTreasure Island\n,\nMission Rock\nand\n5M\nadded hundreds of housing units during the pandemic. But apartment starts have largely stalled in recent years as developers deal with inflation, city fees, a construction materials shortage and tariffs.\nConsider FivePoint Holdings\u2019 Hunters Point Shipyard and Candlestick Point developments. More than 10,000 homes were approved for construction in 2010, but environmental hazards and other setbacks have kept the projects in limbo. The following year, Parkmerced was approved for 5,600 new units, but construction was pushed continually before falling by the wayside entirely during the pandemic.\nA mixed-use project was set to rise at 655 Fourth Street in South of Market in 2020 but was revised and approved in 2023 for 1,110 housing units, plus office space. Like other major developments in SoMa, that project has yet to get off the ground. Nearby, other projects like\n88 Bluxome\nand the\nSan Francisco Flower Mart\nare seeking plan revisions that could include an increased focus on housing as office demand in the city claws back from pandemic lows.\nUCSF\u2019s Power Station development\nConstruction at the Power Station mixed-use development in Dogpatch is about to take a big jump forward.\nAssociate Capital and the University of California, San Francisco\nwill start construction\nnext week on an eight-story, 300,000-square-foot cancer center that will provide proton therapy and other health services to patients. UCSF bought the 50,000-square-foot parcel from Associate Capital in the spring for $75 million.\nConstruction will be funded in part by up to $575 million in tax-exempt, fixed-rate revenue bonds from the\nCalifornia Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank\n. Costs are estimated to be about $400 million.\nThe first tranche of housing at the Power Station development, the 105-unit Sophie Maxwell affordable housing project, is slated for delivery in October. Up to 2,600 homes and 1.6 million square feet of space are approved for the site.\nMadison Capital\u2019s swing for crypto HQ\nMadison Capital\nis making a play on one the largest cryptocurrency headquarters in San Francisco.\nThe New York-based investment firm bought a loan from Affinius Capital backed by 600 Battery Street, a 125,000-square-foot building near Jackson Square currently serving as the corporate home of crypto company Ripple. The sale price of the loan hasn\u2019t been disclosed, though Madison is thought to have spent more than $80 million,\naccording\nto the San Francisco Business Times.\n\nAffinius predecessor Square Mile Capital originated a $106.2 million loan for the property in 2019 when TMG Partners and Invesco acquired the building for about $115 million, or $920 per square foot.\nRipple planted its flag at 600 Battery in 2022 when it leased the whole three-story building for its headquarters. It will stay in its space at the site.\nWith Madison now owning the building\u2019s debt, it could be well positioned to buy the building outright.\nSan Jose\u2019s ADU condo sale\nFor the first time ever in California, homeowners can sell accessory dwelling units as standalone condos.\nThe city of San Jose\napproved a backyard ADU\non Jos\u00e9fa Street near downtown to be sold as a condominium, utilizing Assembly Bill 1033 to make the sale happen. AB 1033 became state law last year, and San Jose was the first large city in the state to adopt the law last July.\nMayor Matt Mahan called the sale a \u201cproof of concept for California.\u201d\nThe ADU was developed by Bay Area real estate firm AlphaX RE Capital. San Jose has permitted 1,500 ADUs since 2022 and issued final building permits for more than 1,110.\nCarmel Highlands price record\nA\nmansion in Carmel Highlands\nfeatured on film and television is listed for an eye-popping price.\nThe estate at 157-163 Spindrift Road is asking $91.2 million \u2014 $7,600 per square foot and more than double the record for the most-expensive sale in Monterey County. A $45 million\nhome in Pebble Beach\nset the bar last year.\nThe property was featured in the 1992 thriller \u201cBasic Instinct\u201d as well as an episode of the HBO series \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d which was set in the nearby seaside enclave of Monterey.\nThe property consists of five parcels spanning 5.4 acres and six houses, including a 12,000-square-foot main house, four cottages and a new one-bedroom abode. Colorado-based software entrepreneur Gary Vickers and his wife Kerry Vickers are the sellers of the property that once belonged to world record-holding aviator Steve Fossett.\n",

        "content": "Developer and real estate attorney Isaac Kodsi\u2019s final project will be completed by members of his family following his unexpected death.\nKodsi\ndied in early August\nat the age of 59.\nHe was nearing completion of Arbor Residences, a Coconut Grove condo project that he acquired out of foreclosure in 2023. He was working closely with two of his adult children, Joseph and Camilla, at the family firm.\nKodsi\u2019s brother, condo developer Dan Kodsi, will work with Camilla to complete the 45-unit building at 3034 Oak Avenue, just north of the neighborhood\u2019s downtown, Dan tells me. Arbor has secured contracts for more than 60 percent of the building. Remaining units start at $1.7 million. Sandra Masis from Cervera Real Estate has been handling sales.\nDan says he will ensure the project is completed but that Camilla will take the lead and continue her father\u2019s legacy.\n\u201cShe\u2019s got a great grip on what\u2019s happening on the property,\u201d he says. \u201cFor someone who doesn\u2019t have that level of experience, she\u2019s doing a great job.\u201d\nIsaac lived nearby in Coconut Grove with his wife, Teresita, and their children.\nDan says that while the residential market has been slow, Arbor is priced slightly lower than other buildings in the area, giving it an advantage. The building is expected to receive its temporary certificate of occupancy by the end of the year.\nIt will mark the long-awaited next chapter for Arbor. The previous developer, a partnership led by Nick Hamann and Jeremy Waks, launched sales at Arbor in 2017 and planned to deliver the building in 2019. Completion was delayed before the pandemic.\nCamilla Kodsi wrote in a statement that completing the project, alongside her brother and uncle, \u201cis deeply personal for me.\u201d\nIsaac bought the property out of foreclosure, returned buyers\u2019 deposits and paid the general contractor and subcontractors who were owed money. Had the lender foreclosed on the site, the buyers likely would not have received their deposits back, he told me in 2023.\nWhat we\u2019re thinking about:\nI\u2019m working on a story about the state of the Brickell condo market, focusing on new developments in the pipeline. What are you hearing? Send me a note at\nkk@therealdeal.com\n.\nCLOSING TIME\n\nResidential\n: Billionaire Russell Weiner\npaid $35.3 million\nfor the waterfront mansion at 43 Star Island Drive in Miami Beach. The late Dr. David Frankel, a prominent dermatologist, owned the 11,104-square foot, eight-bedroom mansion with his wife, Linda Frankel. Weiner plans to renovate and expand the home, eventually listing it for sale for more than $100 million.\nCommercial\n: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\u2019 real estate investment arm, Property Reserve, paid $152.5 million for a 384-unit building known as Del Ola at 7801 North Federal Highway in Boca Raton. Clarion Partners sold the apartment building.\n\u2014 Research by Mary Diduch\nNEW TO THE MARKET\nThe 14,321-square-foot, seven-bedroom estate at 2315 South Ocean Boulevard in Palm Beach hit the market for $73 million. The 1.8-acre property, with two pools, a theater, gym, guest quarters and more, is listed with Gary Pohrer of Serhant and Nick Malinosky of Douglas Elliman. It previously\ntraded in 2022\nfor $44.9 million.\nA thing we\u2019ve learned\nWeiner, the billionaire founder of Rockstar Energy Drink, is the real owner of the waterfront home at 5300 North Bay Road in Miami Beach. He\u2019s been assembling a portfolio of ultra-luxury waterfront properties in the city in recent years.\nElsewhere in Florida\nA federal judge ordered the state to stop accepting new detainees at \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d and dismantle infrastructure added to the former airport site in the Florida Everglades. The ruling stems from a lawsuit by environmental groups and a Native American tribe over the detention center\u2019s effects on the ecosystem,\nCNN\nreports. The state is appealing the ruling.\nSiemens Energy signed a 242,000-square-foot office relocation lease in Lake Nona, marking the largest office lease in Orlando since 2009 and one of the top three ever recorded in the city, according to a press release. Tavistock Group, Lake Nona\u2019s parent company, is the landlord for the building at 6876 Marwick Lane.\nFlorida\u2019s Department of Transportation ordered Miami Beach to remove its rainbow Pride crosswalks by early September, or face state removal and a bill for the costs, the\nMiami Herald\nreports. Overnight last week, FDOT painted over the rainbow crosswalk in Orlando that was a memorial to the 49 victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting in 2016.\nFlorida\u2019s Board of Education voted to end awarding certificates of completion to students with disabilities, leaving them unable to earn a diploma without any formal recognition upon graduation, according to\nCentral Florida Public Media\n.",

The house includes six bedrooms, seven full bathrooms and two half-baths.

What about an office-to-hotel conversion?\nKensico Properties proposed converting 509 Madison Avenue in Midtown from a 21-story office to a 30-story hotel with ground-floor retail space, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. Nabil Chartouni\u2019s firm filed a rezoning application with the Department of City Planning.\nThe conversion plans call for 96 hotel rooms, as well as a lobby and amenity spaces, all stretching across 139,000 square feet. The retail space would occupy 3,300 square space and have separate frontage from the hotel.\nA decade ago, it wasn\u2019t even clear if Kensico would be holding on to the property. In 2017, it\nput its leasehold of the office property on the market\n, despite high occupancy rates remaining strong. The leasehold never sold.\nTenants at the building today include investment firm Banyan Tree Capital Management, private equity firm Yellowstone Capital Partners and Kensico itself, all of which would likely be displaced by a conversion that doesn\u2019t appear to leave any office space behind.\nNone of the relevant players commented to the outlet about the application. Should the conversion take place, the hotel would be competing with the likes of Omni Berkshire Place, Lotte New York Palace and Hotel Elysee in the neighborhood.\n\nNew York City\u2019s hotel market is\noutperforming\nthe rest of the sector nationally in a number of key metrics, including average weekly occupancy rate \u2014 82 percent in the first half of the year, according to CoStar \u2014 and revenue per available room in the city per night, which averaged $238.93 a week.\nThe city\u2019s hotel owners are benefitting from a pair of critical legislative changes in recent years.\nA 2021 City Council bill mandated a special permit for new hotel developments, essentially\nfreezing the sector\u2019s construction pipeline\n.\nTwo years ago, the city began cracking down on short-term rentals, blocking platforms from processing payments to hosts that were either unregistered with the city or didn\u2019t have approval to rent their properties for fewer than 30 days.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

        "content": "Brookfield Properties is facing a foreclosure push at one of its Downtown Brooklyn office buildings, where Rialto Capital Management alleged a $132.7 million loan default.\nRialto, acting as special servicer, filed a pre-foreclosure complaint on Aug. 21 in New York State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, according to\nPincusCo\n. The loan, originated in 2013 at $170 million and securitized into a Morgan Stanley Bank of America Merrill Lynch CMBS trust, matured in September 2023. The borrower, Forest City Myrtle Associates \u2014 controlled by Brookfield \u2014 allegedly failed to pay off the balance at maturity.\nRialto claims at least $132.7 million remains due, a total that doesn\u2019t include reserves but factors in principal, interest and default interest. The loan is secured by 115 Myrtle Avenue, a 692,000-square-foot office building formerly known as 15 MetroTech Center. The property is part of the Brooklyn Commons campus, which Brookfield\nrebranded\nin 2022 after acquiring Forest City Realty Trust in 2018.\nBrookfield invested in upgrades to the property after its acquisition, with reports of renovations underway in 2021. Records show the building generated $25.9 million in revenue in the most recent year, about $37 per square foot, roughly in line with its assessed market value of $132.7 million.\nFor Brookfield, the foreclosure threat comes as its New York portfolio remains heavily weighted toward office \u2014 58 percent of its holdings \u2014 with $13.8 billion in debt across city properties.\n\nThe firm isn\u2019t alone in facing maturing CMBS debt with limited refinancing options, but a foreclosure fight in Brooklyn highlights the growing risks for landlords outside Manhattan\u2019s core.\nRepresentatives for Brookfield and Rialto did not immediately respond to requests for comment from\nThe Real Deal\n.\nRialto\u2019s aggressive tactics have proven\nnewsworthy\nin recent months. Citywide, property owners and court records show Rialto waging war against Signature Bank borrowers, creating defaults on deals in good standing by ignoring borrowers\u2019 notices to exercise loan extensions and then suing to foreclose.\nRialto has said it is following the rules and has only enforced its rights and remedies in \u201crare instances\u201d in which sponsors defaulted and failed to communicate. The firm previously told\nTRD\nit remains committed to borrowers and finding the \u201cbest resolutions possible.\u201d\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The total was on par with the\nprevious period\n, which logged 23 pending deals.\nStreisand paid $420,000 for the 9,200-square-foot home in 1970.

Home prices are up too with 5.2 percent last month from last July with a median price of $1.7 million.\nAs demand increases, supply has been slow to increase. Only 1,453 homes in new buildings, excluding renovations and additions, were completed last year \u2014 less than a third of the more than 5,000 new homes completed in 2020\n.\nPlans for just 2,541 new homes were filed last year. As it stands, the city lags behind its state-mandated\nHousing Element\ngoal of permitting 82,000 units by 2031.\nWhile some megaprojects completed hundreds of new housing units during the pandemic, such as Treasure Island, Mission Rock and 5M, other projects across the city have been slow to get off the ground.\n\nAt the Hunters Point Shipyard and Candlestick Point site, for example, more than 10,000 homes were approved for construction in 2010. But environmental hazards at the shipyard including nuclear toxins and radium-filled paint have presented a major hurdle, leading developer FivePoint Holdings to instead focus on the Candlestick project, though that one has also been stuck in delays as well.\nParkmerced, the largest apartment complex in the city, was set to receive 5,600 new units in 2011, but its construction start was repeatedly delayed before the pandemic paused it entirely. Maximus Real Estate Partners defaulted on its mortgage and surrendered the 3,221-unit property earlier this year;\nnew receiver Douglas Wilson Companies\nis focused on maintenance issues rather than new units.\nIn South of Market, the Creamery closed in 2020 to make way for a\nBjarke Ingels\n-designed mixed-use project, though the Danish visionary is no longer involved. The plan was revised to include 1,110 units and was approved in 2023, but it, like all the major projects\nplanned in the Central SoMa area,\nhas yet to start construction in the face of high construction costs and weaker office demand for office space.\nNearby, other projects like the new\nSan Francisco Flower Mart\nand\n88 Bluxome\nhave sought plan revisions that could include more focus on housing.\nOceanwide Center, meanwhile, broke ground in SoMa in 2016 but was paused in 2019 and later sued by construction firms claiming they were never paid. It\u2019s just a hole in the ground today, according to the Chronicle \u2014 not unlike Oceanwide\u2019s abandoned, graffiti-filled skyscraper in downtown Los Angeles.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

        "content": "ZD Jasper\u2019s luxury condo project on the Upper East Side is full steam ahead thanks to fresh financing from Madison Realty Capital.\nThe lender provided a $73 million construction loan for the Queens developer\u2019s project at 171 East 86th Street, the former home of Papaya King, Crain\u2019s\nreported\n. The financing is expected to support ZD Jasper through the entire building process, expected to be a $112 million endeavor.\nAn Arrow Real Estate Advisors team including Morris Betesh, Omar Ferreira and Jacob Petrovic arranged the financing.\nJasper Wu\u2019s firm\nfiled\nplans for the site between Third Avenue and Lexington Avenue last April. ZD Jaspser is aiming to build an 18-story property with 24 luxury condo units, ranging from two- to five-bedroom pads sprawled across 81,000 square feet. The pricing has yet to be determined. Residential amenities will include a fitness center, golf simulator and children\u2019s room.\nDevelopment is expected to finish late next year. A bank has already signed on for the 6,000-square-foot ground-floor retail space at the project.\n\nZD Jasper purchased\nthe development site\nfrom Gary Barnett\u2019s Extell Development in late 2023 for $29 million, or roughly $485 per square foot of developed real estate. Extell acquired the site in 2021 for $21 million, then added 10,000 square feet of air rights.\nThe Papaya King location closed after a lengthy dispute. After prolonged uncertainty, the hot dog purveyor relocated and reopened essentially kitty-corner across East 86th Street and Third Avenue.\nIn the spring, ZD Jasper\nscored $125 million\nfor its project at 45-40 Vernon Boulevard in Long Island City. The financing was provided by iCross Capital and arranged by the same Arrow team. ZD Jasper\u2019s plans at the site are for a 23-story, 190-unit luxury condo building at the former Paragon Paint Factory.\nAnd in September, ZD Jasper landed\n$117.5 million\nin construction financing for a project at 430 West 37th Street in Hell\u2019s Kitchen. Maxim Capital Group provided the debt on the mixed-use, condo-forward project.\n\u2014\nHolden Walter-Warner\n",

The properties spent 114 days on the market, on average.\nThirty-eight luxury listings were added to the market, for a total of 1,141 listings.\nThe\nprevious week\n, buyers signed contracts for nine properties in Miami-Dade, asking a combined $62.7 million.\nThe asking dollar volume for the seven single-family homes and two condos under contract last week totals $92.3 million, according to the report, which is authored by the Douglas Elliman team led by Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes.\n\nThe condos that secured buyers last week had an average asking price of $20.7 million and spent 168 days on the market, on average. They totaled $41.4 million in asking dollar volume, or an average of $3,119 per square foot.\nAt the top, Azar\u2019s trust has a pending contract to sell the 7,442-square-foot, four-bedroom and four-and-a-half-bathroom condo at Oceana Bal Harbour, at 10201 Collins Avenue. Unit 2601 is on the market with Ruthie and Ethan Assouline and Eytan Namiedh of the Assouline Team at Douglas Elliman for $35.9 million, or $4,824 per square foot.

        "content": "More than seven years of legal proceedings seeking damages for targeted, systemic overcharging for Section 8 tenants ended last week.\nPangea Properties was accused of systematically overcharging the Chicago Housing Authority for housing choice voucher tenants as alleged in a 2018 whistleblower lawsuit filed by a former employee of Pangea, Antoni Muhawi. The case was closed with a joint stipulation of dismissal, the Promote\nreported\n. Court records filed Aug. 18 show that unless the charges are reinstated in 30 days, the allegations are dismissed with prejudice. Any specific damages awarded to the federal government or Muhawi were not outlined in the court filings. Previously, Pangea denied committing fraud or systemic overcharging while admitting that there were some isolated cases of overcharging.\nWhistleblower complaints against Pangea\u2019s practices began a decade ago, when an investigator with CHA\u2019s Office of the Inspector General received a complaint from a voucher tenant, who was told when touring an apartment that the rent was $820 per month, according to internal emails filed as evidence in the lawsuit. But when she said she had a Section 8 voucher, Pangea told her the rent would be $970. Pangea had 1,130 units with Section 8 tenants at the time of the investigation.\nMuhawi\u2019s complaint alleged that Pangea had an \u201cestablished internal policy\u201d instructing property managers and leasing agents to quote new Section 8 tenants a monthly rent price $150 higher than the target rent for the unit, an amount that matched what the Section 8 renter told the CHA in her complaint.\n\nPangea was one of Chicago\u2019s largest landlords until it sold its portfolio of more than 400 buildings \u2014 amounting to 7,500 units \u2014 to New York-based\nEmerald Empire\nin 2022 for $600 million. It was one of the largest multifamily real estate deals in Chicago\u2019s history. The 2022 sale came after another lawsuit was filed against Pangea Properties. More than a dozen tenants accused the landlord of ignoring repeated requests for repairs, threatening their safety by deferring property maintenance.\nThe 153-page class-action\ncomplaint\nsaid Pangea racked up 5,000 reports of city violations since 2009, including no heat in the winter and rodent and insect infestations.\nEarlier this\nmonth\nThe Real Deal\nreported that Fannie Mae and Emerald entered a forbearance agreement on at least $125 million worth of loans associated with the purchase of Pangea\u2019s holdings.\n\u2014\nEric Weilbacher\n",

        "content": "The South Bay retail market had a tough second quarter.\nSilicon Valley retail vacancy increased, and asking rents dropped in April through June, compared to the previous three months, the Mercury News\nreported\n, citing Cushman &amp; Wakefield. The exit of several national retailers, such as\nBed Bath &amp; Beyond\nand Barnes &amp; Noble, was partially to blame.\nThe South Bay saw a retail vacancy rate of 5.2 percent in the second quarter, up from 4.7 percent in the first quarter, when vacancies hit a six-year low in the area. Retail rents fell from about $2.92 per square foot in the first quarter to $2.81 in the second.\nSome parts of Silicon Valley and the South Bay fared better than others. The retail vacancy rate in\nSunnyvale\nand\nCupertino\nwas 3.1 percent, while North San Jose and Milpitas were at 4.5 percent.\nPalo Alto\n, Mountain View and Los Altos had a 5.1 percent vacancy rate, while downtown San Jose, south San Jose, Los Gatos and Campbell registered a 5.4 percent retail vacancy. The markets in the area with the highest retail vacancy rates were Santa Clara with 5.5 percent and Morgan Hill and Gilroy at 7.5 percent.\n\nWhile the trend might raise some concerns, investors don\u2019t appear to be shaken and are looking toward the long term in the South Bay.\nLast December, Arc Capital Partners and Milan Capital Management bought The Plant shopping center in San Jose for $95 million, the Mercury News\nreported\n. After that purchase, a supermarket and discount store moved into spaces that had been empty and several new leases at the property were signed.\nElsewhere in the South Bay, retail centers have begun finding more tenants for previously vacant spaces. At Almaden Plaza in south San Jose, for example, the former homes of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and Barnes &amp; Noble have been filled by Hobby Lobby with a 62,000-square-foot lease and Sports Basement renting 86,000 square feet.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez\n",

San Jose was the first large city in the state to adopt the law last July.\n\u201cADUs are affordable by design and growing in popularity across the state, and now they can offer the most accessible form of home ownership too,\u201d Mayor Matt Mahan said in a\nstatement\n, saying the city\u2019s ADU condo sale approval is a \u201cproof of concept for California.\u201d\n\nThe unit, located on Jos\u00e9fa Street near downtown, was developed by Bay Area real estate firm AlphaX RE Capital. It plans to build dozens more hoping to pursue similar moves, saying it can \u201coffer homeownership at more attainable price points, giving families the opportunity to build equity and long-term stability,\u201d AlphaX founder and CEO Stephanie Yi said.\nSan Jose has permitted 1,500 ADUs since 2022 and issued final building permits for more than 1,110, according to the Chronicle. Other Bay Area cities like Berkeley and San Francisco are considering similar measures to help confront the housing crisis.\nHomeowners in California and across the country looking to build ADUs could stand to benefit from a new bill proposed in Congress by former San Jose mayor and current congressman Sam Liccardo.\nLast month, Liccardo\nproposed\nthe Supporting Upgraded Property Projects and Lending for Yards (SUPPLY) Act, which would provide government-backed, flexible financing options to help homeowners overcome ADU construction costs. The act would direct the Federal Housing Administration to provide government backing for second mortgages to finance ADU construction and would permit\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac\nto purchase and securitize those loans.\n\u2014\nChris Malone M\u00e9ndez",
